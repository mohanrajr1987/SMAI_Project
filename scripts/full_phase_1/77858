Positive 77858 pSo I have been learning how to use the raspberry pi for the last week and so I did download SSH PuTTY to get access to the Pi and everything worked great, I would use the terminal and access directories. Then I wanted to connect the pi to the internet so I bridged my windows 8.1 WiFi connection to my pis connection via Ethernet USB adapter and when I did this, I got no internet connection or connection to the Pi in general, I even tried to ping to the pi via command prompt in windows to no avail. I know that I am using the right ip address and the lights at both the Ethernet ports are blinking like they did before I lost the ability to connect. Please help, I cannot find anything. p
Positive 77858 phow do i check whats happening Application gets SIGSEGV but gdb does not give any specific details. Would you be so kind to shed a bit of light how to investigate thisp  pJust an FYI, this happens only on Raspberry PI  tested out on MacOSX  SIGSEGV shows after some time on PI, so its hard to catch immediately what is happening.

Positive 77858 pI have a main c program running on a raspberry pi using mono, and another program that isnt mine, written in c that gets some Bluetooth info. p  pIve looked at a couple of ways of getting the Bluetooth info from the c program to the main c. Turning the c program into a DLL seemed to be the best option. But I cant get it to compile using visual studio cant get all the Linux .h files or on the pi with gcc. p  pDoes anyone have a good method of creating a dll for the pi, or a better way to pass data between programs or a way for mono to access bluetooth functions. As far as I know it cant do this   p

Positive 77858 pI bought a Raspberry Pi model B a while ago. I just noticed that although I am not running much things on it, its heating up. It takes it about 10 minutes to heat up after being plugged in. Online people say that they have their Pi running 247 without heating. I am aware that the model B is a little out of date, is that why Has it got anything to do with what Ive used to plug it in Im using a cable specifically for the pi but the plug Im using is separate. The only accessorie I have plugged in is a small speaker that gets its power from the pi. It is built specifically for it. I obviously have a wifi dongle and a keyboard, again all built specifically for the Pi. Any ideas Ive ordered some heat sinks for it and will probably buy a fan. I want to be able to run it 247 with only the occasional reboot. I plan on making some projects with it. p

This is what I havep  precodeimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO import time  def blinkpin     GPIO.output11, GPIO.LOW     time.sleep.2     GPIO.output11, GPIO.HIGH     time.sleep.2     GPIO.output11, GPIO.LOW     time.sleep.2     GPIO.output11, GPIO.HIGH     time.sleep.2     GPIO.output11, GPIO.LOW     time.sleep.2     GPIO.output11, GPIO.HIGH     time.sleep4  def main      GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BOARD      GPIO.setup11, GPIO.OUT     GPIO.setup16, GPIO.IN      GPIO.output11, GPIO.HIGH      while True         if GPIO.input16             blink11         else             pass         time.sleep.1      GPIO.cleanup  if name  main     main codepre  pThis seem to only make it blink right after the button is pressed, but not continually. Could you please help me Im extremely frustrated. Thanksp

Negative 77858 pHere is my scenariop  pI have implemented set logic in my C framework.  Sets can contain a large quantity of objects, perhaps even up to 1 million in the worse case.  Assume sets just contain lists of objects called Doc.  Because of the potential large number of objects, I would like to give the developer a choice of how to create and use sets.p  pFor smaller sets, the developer can just create a new set and add doc objects to the set.  Normal set logic is available such as union, intersect, etc.  The developer can then at any point persist the set with my OR layer in which the set will have a primary ID assigned to it.p  pFor very large sets which are persisted in the database, I would like to circumvent the process of extracting the IDs of the doc objects from the database and then saving the IDs back into the set object by allowing manipulation of the set in the SQL 2008 CLR.  I would like to have a simple function such as this signaturep  precodepublic void AddSetMembersint setID, ExpressionltFuncltDoc, boolgtgt Where codepre  pThis would allow the developer to add arbitrary documents to the set matching the Expression without extracting all of the IDs from the database with the only purpose of adding them to the set.p  pMy question is how best to approach this implementation in a stored procedure  Can I somehow pass a lambda to a stored procedure  I had thought about implementing an IDoc interface and loading it into the CLR and having a signature such asp  precodepublic void AddSetMembersint setID, ExpressionltFuncltIDoc, boolgtgt Where codepre  phowever I would still need to pass the lambda to the SP.  I want to make the framework flexible enough so that the developer can use different conditions to create sets.p
Negative 77858 pMy primary language right now is D, and Im in the process of learning Python because its required for a course Im taking.  While I understand why dynamic languages would be a breath of fresh air for people programming in static languages without type inference or templates IMHO templates are to a large extent compiletime duck typing, Im curious what the benefits are of dynamic languages even when you have those.  p  pThe bottom line is that, if Im going to learn Python, I want to learn it in a way that really changes my thinking about programming, rather than just writing D in Python.  I have not used dynamic languages since I was a fairly novice programmer and unable to appreciate the flexibility they supposedly offer, and want to learn to take full advantage of them now.  What can be done easilyelegantly in a dynamically typed, interpreted language thats awkward or impossible in a static language, strongeven with templates, polymorphism, static type inference, and maybe runtime reflectionstrongp

Negative 77858 pI am surely missing something huge, Ive seen this problem several times so I would like to know your opinion on resolving these codesmells.p  ul liBackground is a windows forms app organized using the MVC architecture pattern.li liData is organized in a hierarchical way tree model, with different types of nodes representing different types of data.li liData view is a composite view, containing various views which can be added or modified according to customers request. Each data node can be represented using several views table, chart, custom stuff, and each view knows how to display one or more different data node types.li liBefore displaying, some views also require that the data is processed in some way. Multiple views can use the same processed data, but not all views use the same data, so this processing is not related to the only one view or one node type.li ul  pSo the thing that bothers me is that, in current implementation, nodes interface is becoming overloaded with many properties like Node.CanProvideThisData or Node.CanProvideSomeOtherData, which each derived node is required to implement. This shows that a nodes interface knows too much about everything, rightp  pWho should, in your opinion, decide where and when will this processing happen, so that each view gets the desired processed data, and that no processing is duplicatedp  pDid you have similar problems before Or do you think that there is something wrong with the implementation or my understanding of implementation of MVC Or is this something that could be fixed with some refactoringp  pstrongEditstrong One more thing that should be considered, of course, is handling later modifications. This interface, as bad as it may be, does force the programmer to implement each part of the contract, so any new node implementations should work instantly.p

Negative 77858 pOf what I know of benefits of using initialization list is that they provide efficiency when initializing class members which are not buildin. For example,  p  pcodeFredFred  xwhatever  code     p  pis preferable to,  p  pcodeFredFred  x  whatever   code    p  pif x is an object of a custom class. Other than that, this style is used even with builtin types for the sake of consistency.  p  pThe most common benefit of doing this is improved performance. If the expression whatever is the same type as member variable x, the result of the whatever expression is constructed directly inside x  the compiler does not make a separate copy of the object.  p  pWith the other style, the expression whatever causes a separate, temporary object to be created, and this temporary object is passed into the x objects assignment operator. Then that temporary object is destructed at the . Thats inefficient. p  pQuestionbr  Is there any efficiency gain in the following example with using initialization list. I think there is no gain. The first version calls strings copy constructor and the other calls strings assignment operator there isnt any temporary thats created.

So if it is in the listen state Why wont it accept the connectionp  pIn the code, there are log messages that show the select NEVER even gets a socket ready to read which means ready to accept a connection when it applies to a listening socket.p  pObviously the problem must be related to some race condition between finishing one test which means close and shutdown on each end of the socket, and the start up of the next.p  pThis wouldnt be so bad if the retry logic allowed it to connect eventually after a couple of seconds.  However it seems to get gummed up and wont even retry.p  pHowever, for some strange reason the listening socket SAYS its in the LISTEN state even through keeps refusing connections.p  pSo that means its the Windoze OS which is actually catching the SYN packet and returning a RST packet which means Connection Refused.p  pThe only other time I ever saw this error was when the code had a problem that caused hundreds of sockets to get stuck in TIMEWAIT state.

Negative 77858 pIn an ASP.NET 2.0 application, I want to permit a user to select a MenuItem, even if the user does not click the actual text of the MenuItem, but instead only clicks the highlight area that ASP.NET places around the currently selected MenuItem represented by the DynamicHoverStyle.BackColor property. Since the BackColor is displayed the same width for each MenuItem in a submenu, based on MenuItem with the longest text, I would like to make the hitzone clickable area of each subMenuItem the same width same at the BackColor area, regardless of how much text is displayed in the in each individual subMenuItem.p  pHeres the setup. I am using a Menu on a MasterPage to display a similar menu on each of my pages. Some of the pages suppress this menu, and some of them add addition MenuItems, sometimes to the top level, sometimes adding subMenuItems to an existing toplevel MenuItem, and sometimes both adding a MenuItem to the top level and then additional MenuItems as submenuitems to that newly added top level.p  pThis menu has a horizontal orientation, and it is dynamic, in that only the top level is initially exposed, and the submenus are displayed when selected.p  pDuring usability testing, we noticed that users would select a toplevel menu item to expose the submenu, and then select a submenu item, but not by necessarily clicking on the submenu item text, but instead clicking on the BackColor area of the submenu item. Since the text of some MenuItems are longer than others, MenuItems with short Text have a rather large BackColor area. When the user clicks on the BackColor area, but not directly on the MenuItem Text, nothing happens, since the user didnt actually click on the submenu item hit zone.p  pAlthough there are visual cues as to what part of the displayed MenuItem is clickable the mouse pointer changes to a link cursor when the mouse is positioned on the MenuItem Text, but not when it is only hovering over the BackColor, this behavior confused the users. They highlighted a MenuItem, and clicked it, but nothing happened.p  pI would like to make clicking a MenuItem successful, even if the user did not click on the actual Text of the MenuItem, but simply click on the BackColor area.p  pIt seems like there should be a property somewhere to control the width of the active area of the displayed MenuItems, but I do not see it. Any suggestions, given that I am creating some of these MenuItems at runtimep

Negative 77858 pIm trying to improve the portability of a C app by using boostthreads instead of our own wrapper over Win32 threads, and the issue of graceful thread termination again rears its ugly head.p  pOn pure win32, I interrupt threads by using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms68495428VS.8529.aspx relnofollowQueueUserAPCa to throw a threadinterrupt exception which causes all RAII objects to cleanup on the way out, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions209086howdoiguaranteefastshutdownofmywin32app210385210385as described herea. Any alertable OS function can be interrupted in this way, so things like mutex waits, sleeps, serial and socket IO are all possible interruption points.p  pHowever, boostmutexes etc. arent alertable by QueueUserAPC on win32  they call things like Sleepn rather then SleepExn, truep  pBoost threads do have an interrupt mechanism which similarly involves throwing an exception but it seems to have the drawback that ONLY boostthread calls are interruptable, so a thirdparty socket library for example cannot be interrupted.p  pWhat to do I could modify the boost source locally to make it interruptable, but that feels like a poor choice and I dont think helps the portability. Redesigning the entire app to remove the requirement for graceful thread shutdown is a similarly unappealing route...p

Negative 77858 pThe Java world has a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJavaPortletSpecificationJSR286 standarda for how portals and portlets should interoperate software components sharing a unified web page.p  pThere seem to be a number of portal implementations. But is there a live marketplace of interchangeable portlets that will run in them From what I can find searching the web, it looks very lopsided  all portals and no portlets. Its like if there were dozens of Android phones and no apps.p  pIf a product were to base itself on JSR286 or some implementation thereof, whats the likelihood of a corporate customer having a bunch of portlets that it might want to add to the portalp  pIt strikes me that most corporates will already have a portallike page based on their choice of ERP or CRM product that their business runs on, or maybe even just MS Outlooks Today page. So if I ship a new product intended for corporate customers, and I make it a portal rather than a set of portlets what is the likelihood of my customers abandoning their existing IBMSAPOracle portal and using my portal as their new homepage Im guessing not great. And if I make it a set of JSR286 compliant portlets, are my customers going to have a way to host host portlets Im guessing also not great.p  pFinally, JSR286 seems quite mute about HTMLJavaScript, i.e. how portals and portlets would interoperate inside the browser. Its all about Javabased serverside stuff, defining a way to cooperate in the use of URLs so that each fullpagerefresh can be routed to the correct portlet. It doesnt seem to acknowledge the modern, rich AJAX approach. It mentions AJAX only in passing.p  pa hrefhttptoday.java.netarticle20090116jsr286edgeirrelevanceThis blog post and the comments under ita have provided a lot of food for thought and seem to confirm my suspicionsp  blockquote   pProfessional handson experience along   with the above research led me to the   conclusion that the portal   architecture lacks enough technical   advantages and distinguishing features   to warrant an increase in acceptance.   In practice, few applications can   constrain themselves to the isolated   and disparate functionality of   portlets, and strongrelinquishing this   degree of architectural control is   unrealisticstrong in enterpriselevel   software... the portal architectures   window of opportunity to become a   mainstream technology has not only   closed, but closed quite some time   ago.p blockquote  pSo to summarise this as a more coherent question what actual value would I get by building on JSR286 at this pointp

Negative 77858 pI have a series of models for my application. Across all these models there are will be some 200 or 300 instance variables. The application stores its persistent data on a webbased server MySQL  but I guess that part doesnt matter. Whenever a model iVar is updated I need to make a call to the server to update the appropriate value for that iVar.p  pMy current model strategy is header filep  precodeinterface MyModel  NSObject       NSString  firstName     NSString  lastName   property readwrite, copy NSString  firstName property readwrite, copy NSString  lastName  end codepre  pimplementation filep  precodeimplementation MyModel  synthesize firstName synthesize lastName  idinit       [super init]      [self setFirstNameGeorge]     [self setLastNameKastanza]      return self   voidsetFirstNameNSString aName        call method to update server with new value here     firstName  aName   voidsetLastNameNSString aName        call method to update server with new value here     lastName  aName   end codepre  pThe problem is that if I have 200 or 300 iVars all needing to go through the same update call to the server that means writing a emlotem of setters. Moreover, if I need to make a change to the method call, Id have to update each and every method in every setter i the entire application.p  pIs there a process by which I could run every set of an iVar through a method first, before settingp  pI thought of having just a codeNSMutableDictionarycode per model object to store all of the iVars, but that abstracts the setters and getters and may introduce a big memory footprint for so many dictionaries. However, doing it this way means that every time the dictionary is set I could pass it through one method.p  pAs I understand it dynamically adding iVars at runtime to an object model is considered a bad thing because of the pointer referencing for any subclasses that may be dependent upon the model the subclass pointer doesnt get offset unless a complete recompile is done.p  pAny ideas and suggestions much appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pBased upon Oles recommendation here is the solution although it uses a little more code than a few lines unfortunately...p  pIn the model I added a method that I can set when I need to.

All I have to do is create a mock SP caller class responsible for the actual execution of the SP and set my desired response data.  Im very happy with this technique and its much simplier than the above as its data focused rather than worrying about implementation details.  But my question is, when would you want to use MockRunner  It seems overkill for unit tests, so am I guessing its more for integration or system testing  And even then, it still strikes me as easier to use a DI framework to swap out the SP caller class then to setup all the code above for every stored procedure call.

Negative 77858 pI have say list of 1000 beans which I need to share among different projects. I use memcache for this purpose. Currently, loop is run over complete list and each bean is stored in memcache with some unique memcache id. I was wondering, instead of putting each and every bean in memcache independently. Put all the beans in hashmap with the same key which is used for storing beans in memcache, and then put this hashmap in memcache. Will this give me any significant improvement over putting each and every bean individually in memcached. Or will this cause me any trouble because of large size of the object. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 77858 pI need to be override certain macro definition by my header file. And I am not allowed to change source code. And I have to use gcc, but if anyone is aware of something similar on any other compiler then also it will help.p  pHere is what I exactly needp  pLets say I have code base with lot of .c files. These .c files include .h files. After all the .h files have been included for each file I want the compiler to behave as if I have another codeextra.hcode file which I want to specify when invoking the compiler. What I do in that .h file is codeundefcode some macro and redefine the macro the way I want them to be.p  pNote I am aware of codepreincludecode option in gcc, but using codepreincludecode overrides my extra.h by the .h of the original source code. What I need is some kind of post include option.p

Negative 77858 pI want to create cube model of a 32x32 bitmap in opengl. For example, the result should look something like this given a 2D bitmap of Bobomb from Super Mario a hrefhttpfc02.deviantart.netfs49f2009186faBobombinMinecraftbyLuafox.png relnofollowhttpfc02.deviantart.netfs49f2009186faBobombinMinecraftbyLuafox.pnga The idea is to represent each 2D pixel from the bitmap as a 3D cube.p  pEach model will represent an enemy in a game so I need to be able to render these quickly.  What would be a good way of doing thisp  pOne attempt Ive made is to generate a static 3D model from the bitmap by first creating a 32x32x2 grid of vertices and then creating triangles from these vertices in the appropriate places to form the cube faces. One big problem Im having though is how to store the colors and normals for the faces. The triangles of each face need to share a vertex and that shared vertex needs to store the color and the normal for that face. However, I dont think I have enough vertices for each face to have the appropriate color and normal. I cant think of an elegant way to solve this.p

Negative 77858 pFirst I must declare that Im an extreme newbie. Have just been using PHP and MySQL for about 4 weeks now. Please accept my apologies in advance if I havent formatted this question correctly or am not using proper terms of art.p  pI am building a store locator application. For testing, I have a table named locations that contains name, address and latitudelongitude data for 5 different restaurant chains with 1500 total location records. p  pI got the app running fine as a standard store locator where the user inputs their address and a distance in miles to search. The code below properly returns those results when the GROUP BY statement is removed. For example, when the user inputs their address and distance to search, the SELECT statement returns ALL of the restaurants within that distance just fine.p  pMy app requires that strongonly the nearest location of each restaurant chainstrong within the user specified distance be returned and displayed. I added the GROUP BY statement to accomplish this. The correct number of records are returned with the correct locname and distance from the user. However, all of the other fields are never correct. They seem randomly selected from other records that are outside of the MIN value. For example, the 1st record returned is for DAIRY QUEEN at a distance of 4.38 mile  strongthats correctstrong. However, the address, state, city, etc. for the DAIRY QUEEN at 4.38 miles strongare not correctstrong.p  pI have read extensively about issues with GROUP BY and the requirement to use an INNER JOIN perhaps to solve my problem A recent question and answer in stackoverflow addresses this very specifically, see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions788095mysqlselectingwrongcolumnvalueingroupbyqueryMySQL Selecting wrong column value in Group By querya. All the solutions Ive read so far would have me using the computed distance as a key to perform the JOIN and I dont see how thats possible. p  pQuestion 1 How do I construct the SELECT statement to get my desired result the complete row of data fields strongfor only one each of the restaurant chainsstrong in the locations tablep  pNotes about my code that is strongnot as scarystrong as it looks and not necessary to understand to solve my problemp  pThe trig formula within MIN computes the distance in miles between the users address    translated to latitudelongitude and the latlon of each location record. Trust me, this works OK.p  pORDER BY 13 statement means to ORDER by the 13th field listed in the SELECT, in this case it is the alias distance. Im mentioning this because Ive noted that this syntax is not well known. p  pThe code following the WHERE statement checks to see if the users address in latlon is within a box with latlon corners that are the user specified distance of locations to search. This is called a Bounding Box. Its used to optimize the search time. One could simply test to see if distance is lt than user input distance but that would require reading the entire locations file. The production version will contain approximately a million records. An index is in place for the locations table loclat,loclon,locid. My understanding is that using the Bounding Box in the WHERE statement will limit the range of the index that needs to be read. Question 2 Is this true the way I have it implemented, will it be processed as I described Will the solution to Question 1 retain the optimizationp  pThank all of you in advance for your help. Im really just 4 weeks into mySQL and PHP and as you can see, in over my headp  hr  pstrongMy question boils down to this.

Negative 77858 pI am implementing a RESTful Web Service backed by PostgreSQL.

But is there any way short of renting Watson now that hes back from Jeopardy that my program can look at a SQLException and guess whether the problem is a user error or a system errorp  pI dont know a lot about SQL.  I note that SQLState is a fivecharacter string, and the first two characters are the Class Code.p  pHere are my guesses so farp  pClass 00  Successful completion, no exception thrown.p  pClass 01  Warning.  Is a SQLException thrown in this case  If so, result should probably be 400 Bad Request.p  pClass 02  No Data normal result when no results returnedp  pClass 03  SQL Statement Not Yet Complete  probably a programming error, not an end user error, therefore 500 Internal Server Errorp  pClass 08  Connection Exception  obviously 500 Internal Server Errorp  pClasses 09  21  Probably 500 Internal Server Errorp  pClass 22  Data Exception.  The specific example I am working on raises 22001 ERROR value too long for type character varying250.  This should be returned as 400 Bad Request.  There is length validation on the name field before the SQL statement is executed but the value actually stored is a full path name, i.e. the name appended to some other stuff.  I can probably return 400 Bad Request for other class 22 errors, even though many of them would stem from programming errors.p  pThe other classes look like 500 Internal Server Error would usually be the more correct status.p

Negative 77858 pI have a client who wants to migrate his Rails app to Heroku. However the client also has a blog associated with his domain that runs on WordPress.

I have two ideasp  ol lipUse rackrewrite or refraction or just a regular old 301 and Apache modrewrite on the old nonHeroku server to redirect the main url from the old site to Heroku. In this case, I can just leave the Wordpress blog running happily where it is. I think Is there a reason to choose one of those options rackrewrite, refraction, or modrewrite over the others if I do it this waypli lipSwitch the DNS info to point to the Heroku site, and then use a 301 redirect from the blog to the old site. But then Ill have to get the old nonHeroku site on a subdomain and use some kind of rewrite rules anyway so it looks like it isnt a subdomain.pli ol  pAre either of these approaches preferable, or is there another way to do it thats easier that Im missing p

Negative 77858 pIve developed a web application in django, and Im interested in accurately knowing how many people visited certain pages and keeping that info in my database. As I was already running some code whenever a page was loaded, I had a small bit of code that increased the counter in 1. p  pHowever, when implementing memcached in this application, the cached pages are served statically and the code is not executed. Im thinking on adding javascript code in the page that tells the server the page has been served, but somehow that doesnt look like the best idea.p  pIs there any way to compromise between having memcached statically provide the dynamic pages as long as they dont change, but still be able to know the page has been served for statistical purposes in my databasep  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 77858 pIm getting a little lost trying to use both a UITabBarController and UINavigationController in MonoTouch.p  pI can create a navigation based project, and navigate using only a navigationController, fine. Or I can add a tabBarController and navigating to a couple of main screens, fine.p  pHowever, I cant seem to navigate to another without using the TabBarController if one is present. E.g, Im doing an app that deals with foo, so I am two views on my tabbar, FooHome, and FooSettings. How do I navigate to a new view if the user click something like Add Foo on the FooSettings view.p  pThe NavigationController.PushToView doesnt seem to have any effect, and I dont want to add the view to the tabController since its nice and simple with only two items.p  pShould I be using this.View.AddSubView The idea sort of sounds like a dialog box, Im just not sure how to do it with monoTouch...p

Is there a way which i could achieve this Or is it that i would need to have multiple machines in order to achieve that load.p  pIs it true that if i have a quad core pc, i should only spawn at most 4 threads at a time to prevent too heavy context switching because at any one time 4 threads would be runp
Negative 77858 pFirstly I know that programming languages cannot be compared in a sense. So let me explain my situation clearly. Im about to teach a friend how to program for web, he works as an accountant so he only need to build some simple apps that do some calculation and store them in a DB. He never ever had touch a code before. So I thought perhaps Ruby on Rails would be a good choice, but someone suggested since my friend is nonEnglish speaker Rails syntax would be a bit difficult for him, and php could be much simpler. Im a bit confused here. My question is which web language would be easer to learn specially for nonEnglish speaker not in term of functionality p  pemBTW, Im not native english speaker, thats obvious above , but not too bad in english, thats why I didnt find learning Rails is difficult.emp  pRegardsp

Negative 77858 pI am trying to spread out data that is received in bursts. This means I have data that is received by some other application in large bursts. For each data entry I need to do some additional requests on some server, at which I should limit the traffic. Hence I try to spread up the requests in the time that I have until the next data burst arrives.p  pCurrently I am using a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTokenbucket relnofollowtokenbucketa to spread out the data. However because the data I receive is already badly shaped I am still either filling up the queue of pending request, or I get spikes whenever a bursts comes in. So this algorithm does not seem to do the kind of shaping I need.p  pWhat other algorithms are there available to limit the requests I know I have times of high load and times of low load, so both should be handled well by the application.p  pI am not sure if I was really able to explain the problem I am currently having. If you need any clarifications, just let me know.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIll try to clarify the problem some more and explain, why a simple rate limiter does not work.p  pThe problem lies in the bursty nature of the traffic and the fact, that burst have a different size at different times. What is mostly constant is the delay between each burst. Thus we get a bunch of data records for processing and we need to spread them out as evenly as possible before the next bunch comes in. However we are not 100 sure when the next bunch will come in, just aproximately, so a simple codedivide time by number of recordscode does not work as it should.p  pA rate limiting does not work, because the spread of the data is not sufficient this way. If we are close to saturation of the rate, everything is fine, and we spread out evenly although this should not happen to frequently. If we are below the threshold, the spreading gets much worse though.p  pIll make an example to make this problem more clearp  pLets say we limit our traffic to 10 requests per seconds and new data comes in about every 10 seconds.p  pWhen we get 100 records at the beginning of a time frame, we will query 10 records each second and we have a perfect even spread. However if we get only 15 records well have one second where we query 10 records, one second where we query 5 records and 8 seconds where we query 0 records, so we have very unequal levels of traffic over time. Instead it would be better if we just queried 1.5 records each second. However setting this rate would also make problems, since new data might arrive earlier, so we do not have the full 10 seconds and 1.5 queries would not be enough. If we use a token bucket, the problem actually gets even worse, because tokenbuckets allow bursts to get through at the beginning of the timeframe.p  pHowever this example over simplifies, because actually we cannot fully tell the number of pending requests at any given moment, but just an upper limit. So we would have to throttle each time based on this number.p
Negative 77858 pSo Ive got this code to drill down into a heirarchy of XML documents from a REST api.

Negative 77858 pIm trying to write an application which will search and retrieve a users profile using data using an id key found using a scanned barcode or embedded in a magnetic strip cards data.  The latter one is cause me grief.  The magstripe data needs to be parsed prior to searching for the user profile.  p  pMy question, is there a way to capture the text scanned into the textbox and parse it before it gets displayed in the textboxp  pMy readerscanner is the keyboard emulation type so its as if each character encoded on the stripe is typed out in the textbox.  I guess a solution but is it the best would  be to intercept each keystroke emulated by the magnetic stripe reader, store them in a buffer and display an empty character until the end of the read string.  Once the end of cards data is read, I could parse and display the id part of id.  Problem is... how do you know its the end of the cards data string if they get inputted as individual char keystrokep

Negative 77858 pIs there a basic calendar display in R, like Unixs codecalcode programp  pI realize its not that hard to wrap the base datetime functions like codeweekdayscode, codeseq.datecode, etc., but I feel like Im ignorant of something pretty basic that may be solved in one of the outstanding timedate packages that already exist.  Moreover, it always starts simply enough assign days of the week, but then one gets to leap years, layout for calendars spanning multiple months though Id settle for just printing 1 month, and so on.p  pMy current usage involves switching out of R to Linux or a calendar program in Windows.  Doing this in R would be easier.p  hr  pNote 1.  Ive looked at some of the various widgets available for Gtk2 and TclTk  for some reason, installation of supporting systems is not working out well and I think its serious overkill, nor is it very good from a portability perspective to have such dependencies.  In Windows, Ive even tried Cygwin, to access codecalcode, but that installation seems to be conflicting with Rtools.  In short, adding layers of stuff is not a particularly productive avenue at the moment.    Ive not found any solutions in lubridate, xts, zoo, and other packages, though I may have missed something. p

Negative 77858 pIm working on code to manage a collection of unique objects.  The first prototype of this code utilises an associative array, basically as thats the way Ive always done it.  p  pHowever, Im also keen on taking advantage of functionality thats been added to more modern versions of PHP such as SplObjectStorage for doing this instead, partly as a learning experience, partly because its bound to offer advantages benchmarks Ive seen suggest that SplObjectStorage can be faster than arrays in a lot of cases.  p  pThe current implementation has an associative array that I check with inarray to see if an object is already in the array before adding a new object to it.  p  pThe big problem I can see with SplObjectStorage is that it doesnt seem at first glance to support keyvalue associative array behaviour, and can only be treated as an indexed array.  However, the documentation for the newer features of PHP isnt up to the standards of the documentation of more established parts of the language and I might simply be missing something.  p  pCan I use SplObjectStorage in place of an associative array  If so, how do I define the key when adding a new object  More importantly, what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of SplObjectStorage when compared to associative arrays p

This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on.  However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality.  If you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.  If you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem.  If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.

Negative 77858 pWhen registering to mousedown and touchdown events on a webview both are triggered at the very same time, leading up to the odd situation of having twice mousedownlike events to deal with. Theres a known workaround which consists of calling event.preventDefault... but I cannot call it because I do need to get the default behavior anyway. And of course I cannot remove the regular mouse events listeners neither without no longer being compatible with a regular computer.p  pTheres another known workaround found here a hrefhttpwww.quirksmode.orgblogarchives201002doweneedtouc.html relnofollowhttpwww.quirksmode.orgblogarchives201002doweneedtouc.htmla which consists of detecting whether the first event that we receive is of touchevent type or not, in the former case we then simply remove the listeners to the mouse events....

Negative 77858 pI have a bit of a strange problem with [La]TeX syntax highlighting in vim. vim seems to randomly switch between three different syntax highlighting styles, with little rhyme or reason. It doesnt emappearem to do this for other languages, though I havent written anything except LaTeX using syntax highlighting for a while now.p  pSo a bit of background. This problem started becoming noticeable when I switched terminal emulators to codeurxvtcode, but it also appears in coderoxtermcode, codekonsolecode, and codegnometerminalcode.p  pPlaying around with the value of the codeTERMcode environment variable does appear to affect the result changing codeTERMcode from the default of coderxvtunicode256colorcode to codextermcode or codelinuxcode appears to make vim not choose the third, but the first two appear to be selected at random.p  pIve done some Googling, to no avail.

Negative 77858 p I have a Delphi XE ISAPI dll running under IIS 7.5  Server 2008 R2. The DLL launches an instance of TISAPIApplication. The application resides at a discreet, fixed, predetermined URL, and listens on a particular port not port 80 for requests  all of this is of course a standard configuration. p  p On my server, I have several dlls, each launching a different instance of the TISAPIApplication, mapped to a different URL, and listening on a different port. At runtime, I distinguish between various instances of the application Dev, Prod, FailOver etc based on the port number easier than parsing URLs.p  p I have looked around in the docs and source code of TISAPIApplication and its ancestor and associated classes, strongbut I cant find anywhere a property that tells me on what port a particular instance of the application is listening  the port seems to be available only on a request by request basis.strong It seems to me that since in simple deployments the listening port is usually static, I should be able grab that port value on app startup  this will facilitate allocating certain resources  then, instead of waiting for a request to come in, etc.p  p strongAnyone know how to do this What property do I need grab, and from wherestrong In fact, I cant find anything at all that will tell me anything about the URL the application itself resides at  everything seems to work on a per request basis.p  pem Please  Im not looking for workarounds telling me how to do it via the request, or that HTTP is stateless and everything works on a per request basis  I know those workarounds and dont want to use them.  And, although threads are spawned by ISAPI to handle requests in a stateless manner, a TISAPIApplication instance is launched when the ISAPI dll is loaded by IIS and this TISAPIApplication instance  persists througout the lifetime of the ISAPI application and contains state information that is valid for the lifetime of the application instance .emp  pTIAp

Negative 77858 pI have a bunch of codeThingycode objects that Im keeping track of using codelongcode ID numbers.  Since I have no guarantees about ID sequence, Im keeping them in a codeHashMapltLong, Thingygtcode for random access.  However, in Android, they have this very nice class called a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidutilSparseArray.html relnofollowcodeSparseArraycodea which they claim is faster than my codeHashMapcode for how Im using it.  Perhaps most notably, it doesnt have the autoboxing tax.  Unfortunately, the keys are codeintcode, not codelongcode.  p  pThe values of my codelongcode IDs are such that Im not worried about overflowing the range of codeintcode anytime this century.  Is that casting from codelongcode to codeintcode plus codeSparseArraycode optimizations are going to be cheaper than autoboxing codelongcode to codeLongcode for my codeHashMapcode operations  My intuition says yes, but Id like some additional input.p

Negative 77858 pIm working on an OpenGL project on Windows, using GLEW to provide the functionality the provided Windows headers lack. For shader support, Im using NVIDIAs Cg.

Negative 77858 pI have been thinking about this for really long time in fact, years and searching best way to handle exceptions in C. And so I thought of tool, which could help me and so I would like to ask if this tool exists I couldnt Google it.p  pThis tool would parse C source code both headers and sources and filled doxygenlike comments with exception info preferably extending comments I already wrote about method itself. For each method exception list would be generated from code  from each time there is throw SomeException command, from list of called functions beware of recursion and from known commands possible throwing exceptions currently, I can fink only of operator new. So I could track all exceptions and see if I forget to manage exception from other modules and see if there is accidental possibility of throwing exception from destructor which prohibited AFAIK.p  pOr I could use similar tool which wouldnt automatically fill doxygen comments, but at least warn me about not commented ones. Similarly like when I run doxygen documentation generator, I forget comment one input variable and the generator warns me about this.p  pSo, is there such tool And if not, is there very simpletouse library parsing C code so I could easily implement it for myselfp  pExamplep  precode Example.h       Does almost nothing.    void foo1      Generates some error.    void foo2   Example.cpp   include Example.h  void foo1      foo2   void foo2      throw MyException  codepre  pThis wouldp  ol lipAdd throw MyException line to foo1 comment.pli lipGive warning foo1 in file ... line ... throws MyException, but not in commentpli ol  pI know that C language provides possibility of specification of possibly thrown exceptions, problem is that this is not checked in compile time, but in runtime. And I need to handle this case stdunexpected if I remember correctly.p  pIts not problem if this tool is needed to be run manually, like doxygen, and not at every time I compile.p

Negative 77858 pIm currently making a plugin for one application and since it doesnt handle the WMMBUTTONDOWN message I decided to hook the WNDPROC but it seems that another plugin hooks it too and handles this message since the application loads the plugins in alphabetical order, theres a chance that I might not hook the WNDPROC last, resulting in the other plugin handling the message first. This means Id have to be the last one to hook the WNDPROC to be able to get to those messages. p  pSo, are there any reliable not relying on alphabetical order, etc. ways of hooking a procedure lastp  pEDIT the hooking is done by changing the DWLWNDPROC property of the window to the address hook procedure using the SetWindowLong function. The original DWLWNDPROC is then called from the hook procedure using CallWindowProc. Sorry for not making this clearp  pThanks, Tuntuni.p

Negative 77858 pIm writing a web application in Erlang, and want to store my data to PostgreSQL.p  pTherere two kinds of resources in my application. One kind is very important while the other one is not that important.p  ul liFor the important one, no data loss is allowed. li liFor the less important one, data loss due to system failure is ok.li ul  pI want to gain maximum efficiency and came up with such an idea write a gateway for PostgreSQL. The gateway is a codegenservercode, and business logic BL parts can talk to the gateway for storing resources.p  ul liFor storing important resources, BL parts send the resources to be stored to the gateway, and strongblockstrong to codereceivecode a message success or failure, and finally respond to the user with a web page.li liFor storing less important resources, BL parts only send the resources to the gateway strongwithout blockingstrong. After sending the resources, BL parts respond with a web page directly.li ul  pWhat Im expecting from this idea is emless seconds per requestem, since emmost of the resources are less important onesem. But I wonder if this is a good idea, or in other words, can I really get what Im expectingp  pPlease answer according to your experience or some reliable web search results. Thanks. p

Negative 77858 pI have a simple F array of records of the following type or some minor variation relying on system typesp  precodetype Transaction      date DateTime     amount float     mutable details string  codepre  pI would like to display them to a DataGridView control in Winforms, including support for changing the content, and adding or deleting rowsrecords.  Binding the DataViewGrid to the array of records does not seem to allow to adddelete rows or I must be doing it wrong. However DataTable structures seem to be a better match for this purpose.  Creating a DataTable of the above type seems to match quite well the original record type, e.g. p  precodelet dataTable  new DataTable     dataTable.Columns.Adddate, typeofltDateTimegt gt ignore     dataTable.Columns.Addamount, typeofltfloatgt gt ignore     dataTable.Columns.Adddetails, typeofltstringgt gt ignore codepre  pSo I wonder if there is an existing system function to convert an array of records e.g., type Transaction array for any type of record relying on system types into the corresponding DataTable, and vice versa  If there isnt such a function, how could this be done in a concise wayp

Negative 77858 pSo Im having a hard time implementing this idea.  I basically just want to take the argument uf and negate it.  I am treating the argument as an unsigned integer in 32bit, this acts as a sort of equivalence to what a single precision floating point number would look like.  Should work the same signed bit, 8 bits of exponent, 23 bits of fractional.p  pHowever, when the argument is NaN, I need to just return the argument. Ideally I want to be able to implement this without any casting or high level operations.  Apparently I should be able to do it with just bitwise operations, and integerunsigned operations if, while, , ampamp.p  pIm not sure where to start with this  Would I just need to extract each part of uf and negate them all separately using bitwise operators, then add them all together at the end  Ill likely use uf  1 for negation.  p  pFor NaN I recognize that I just need to check for all 1s in the 8bit part exp and anything but 0 in the fractional part otherwise its considered infinity.p  pAs a reiteration, this is done in C for a 32 bit system.p
Negative 77858 pI have a table with ZIP files saved as RawData.  Ive extracted the ZIP files using BCP, then unzipped them using 7zip.  The Unzipped files are RTF files that are given the ID number for the name.  For example 56.rtf, 65.rtf, etc.  My question is how do I import the raw RTF data into a row in a table based on the file name  Ive been playing with BULK INSERT and that gets the data into a table with one column, but how do I know which row in the table corresponds to which file so it can be retrieved with a query Im fairly new at this so try to keep it as simple as possible. p

Negative 77858 pIve been trying to format the appearance of the RSS button in css, and for some reason theres a big difference between browsers. Chrome renders it perfectly, as if I dont need to mess with it at all. But on Firefox and IE9, it is uneven with the rest of the menu.

Negative 77858 pI am developing an app that needs to process acceleration values continuously for some time approx. an hour  yes, I would really like to do it that way. The processing involves doing some calculations and updating the UI from time to time. The acceleration is collected inside a foreground service  collecting acceleration should happen if the user minimizes the app as well.p  pMy question is what would be the most appropriate pattern to implement this. I dont want the processing to make the app UI unresponsive.p  pRight now Im collecting acceleration data in the UI thread in the Service. The collected data is than passed to a class that does some calculations and based on them broadcasts an Intent, which is registered in the Main activity to update the UI.p  pShould I be collecting acceleration data in a worker Thread in a service Is this even possible Or should I do the processing in another Thread How would be the best way to do this without starving either the UIacceleration collection Thread or the processing Thread.p  pThanksp

Negative 77858 pI have a homework assignment to do in which I need state possible ways we can recover deleted files from a computer using NTFS. The assignment asks me to think of any pieces of information that may be vital for forensics. However, I dont know how NTFS saves, deletes, and overwrites files in the first placep  pHere is something similar we learned in classp  pIn class we learned that FAT32 saves files in clusters of blocks. When we save a file, it uses up sectors in a cluster, but the file may not use all of the sectors in a cluster, or even all the space in a block.p  pWhen a file is deleted, the file name in the directory has its first letter changed to a sigma, and then the location of the stored file is considered unallocated aka may be overwritten. So we can still search for this file using certain techniques and recover it Even if a new file is written in that address, the new file may be smaller than the previous file. In such a case, the remnants of the previous file that was stored there remains because they were not overwritten. We can recover this as well, assuming its not fragmented.p  pWell, thats what we learned in class. I have to write up a similar piece for the NTFS, but I cant find a simple site that specifically explains how files are saved and deleted in NTFS in the first place. Can anyone give me a link with some valuable reading materialp  pEDIT Ive found the perfect site that explains exactly what I need.

Negative 77858 pI have an app where I have three models. I have leads and customers which are very similar but different enough that they warranted their own models. Then I have a polymorphic model called Interactions which has an interactionableid and an interactionabletype which would, of course, be either customer or lead.p  pI recently tried to build a method that would migrate an interaction from a lead to a customer when a lead is upgraded to being a customer.p  pI wanted to keep my code lean, and in order to keep my method simple, I decided to simply update the attributes of the interaction so that the interactionableid and interactionabletype would change to the customers id and to Customer respectively. p  pI tried many various methods of doing this, and the only thing that I could get to update was the interactionabletype. The interactionableid would not change, no matter what I tried. I tried putting in a static number rather than customer.id. I tried updateattributes and I tried to update the attributes individually and then save it. Also, I did have interactionableid in the attraccessible list. p  pI got this to work because I decided to approach the problem slightly differently, but I could not find any answers out there as to exactly why this was happening.p  pI was just wondering if anyone knew why this might be.

Negative 77858 pIm a newcomer to clang, so its likely Im doing something silly.  But Ive spent several hours looking for solutions, including searching here, where I havent found questions addressing flto with distroprovided packages.  The detail of this description are specific to Fedora 18, but Im having similar problems on Ubuntu 13.04, so the problem isnt specific to Fedora.  Its either me or clang.p  pProblem  Im trying to compile a simple helloworld program using codeclang fltocode to get the benefits of linktimeoptimization.  Without flto it works fine.  With flto it fails to link.

Fedora18 installs gold as codeusrbinld.goldcode.  Ive tried creating a symlink from codeusrlocalbinldcode to codeusrbinld.goldcode, verified that codewhich ldcode says codeusrlocalbinldcode, but clang doesnt use that.  It seems to be hardwired to usrbinld.pli lipclang invoked the linker with codeplugin usrbin..libLLVMgold.socode.  Thats wrong, as the Fedora distribution of clang places it at codeusrlib64llvmLLVMgold.socode.pli ol  pI have tried manually invoking that linker line above with the following tweaksp  ul lipReplace codeplugin usrbin..libLLVMgold.socode with codeplugin usrlib64llvmLLVMgold.socode.  This yields the error message codehello.o file not recognized File format not recognizedcode.  So the nongold linker seems to know about plugins but wont take the .os which contain LLVM bitcode.pli lipReplace codeusrbinldcode with codeusrbinld.goldcode.  This works, generates an executable that runs as expected.pli lipBoth of the above with codeplugincode instead of codeplugincode.  This change makes no difference.pli ul  pSo whats the best way for somebody who prefers to stick to the systemprovided packages to use clang flto  Im hoping there is a config file, or undocumented options or environment variables that will let me override these.  Or better, that Im missing a package and a yum install ... will fix it.p  pI would prefer not to invoke the linker directly, as then my makefiles need to know system objects and libraries that they should be ignorant of e.g. crt1.o, crtbegin.o, crtend.o.  I could also build clang myself, but Im not seeing anything in its configure script that lets me configure the path of the linker and plugin.p  pIm running Fedora 18.

Im still new to NSURLCache and UIWebViews but somehow got the basics down I think.p  pAnyway, I was able to successfully implement Caching for my UIWebViewI think. I initialized the NSURLCache. My UIWebView loads its contents with the loadRequest method. I assigned the ViewController that owns the UIWebView as its delegate. I also had the ViewController implement NSURLConnectionDataDelegate. I implemented the connectionwillCacheResponse method just to log a message in the console so I could check that caching was done. I also logged the current disk and memory usage. It increases after the caching so I can see that it did work.p  pHowever, when I load the page again, I think the request is sent again to the server because the connection delegate methods like connectiondidReceiveResponse and connectionwillCacheResponse are being called.p  pI also wanted to try getting the cachedResponse from the cache by using cachedResponseForRequest. I called this method in webViewDidFinishLoad but it always returns null. Did caching really workp  pHow can you tell if the WebView loaded from the cache Am I misusing cachedResponseForRequest And on another note, what proper ControlCache header values should be present in the very least for caching Im testing on googles homepage URL and it returns the private value for its Cache Control header but I can see that caching works because the connectionwillCacheResponse is called.p  pHelp pleasep
Negative 77858 pI have a process that is running from a task queue that periodically sends messages through a channel to the client. p  pIs it possible to check if the client is still connected to see if the task queue should be sending messages or not p  pI can see this happening if the client page with channel javascript has not yet loaded or they have closed the browser window. In either case I would rather the task queue process not send messages to the client.p

So the structure is quiet simplep  precoderoot  gt 404.php        gt template404.php  rootsubdir gtlanguagexy404.php  codepre  pIn my htaccess files I use a redirect to code404.phpcode in case a page could not be found. p  pIn that code404.phpcode I use codeSERVER[REQUESTURI]code to get the entered address that will be echoed to the user.p  pDepending from the default browser language the code404.phpcode will be redirect to its subdir folder with the language files.p  pSo it goes like thatp  pwrong URL entered  redirect to code404.phpcode  reading out URL and default languages  redirect to language direction codelanguagexy404.phpcode  loading codetemplate404.phpcode from root and echo out wrong URL.p  pNow the problem is that I would like to have clean URLs like codeexample.comlangaugexylanguagexy404.phpcode. Thats why I dont would like to use codeGETcode to send the entered URL to the codelanguagexy404.phpcode. I thought I could save the entered URL into a SESSION on code404.phpcode and simply echo out on codetemplate404.phpcode. The first time this works but when reloading the page for some reason the content of the SESSION has changed. I have no clue why this happens. The codeSESSION[url]code is just used once.p  pSo if there is someone who can give me hints on how to solve this issue I really would appreciate.p  pThanks alot.p

My whole reasoning emwrong or correctem relies on 29.3.12. For what I understood so far, if we ignore the codeatomicflagcode, reading stale data from codevalidcode is possible even if its codeatomiccode. codeatomiccode doesnt seem to mean always immediately visible to every thread. The maximum guarantee you can ask for is a consistent order in the values you read, but you can still read stale data before getting the fresh one. Fortunately, codeatomicflagtestandsetcode and every codeexchangecode operation have this crucial feature they always read fresh data. So, only if you acquirerelease on the codewritingcode flag not only on codevalidcode, then you get the expected behavior.

Negative 77858 pI am having an insanely frustrating problem with core data. In the app I am designing a view where the user can search through songs by their writers, composers, etc. I am storing this data in an codeNSManagedObjectcode subclass. As the data in the app doesnt change, I create the database in another short program and then move the code.sqlitecode file to the bundle of the app.p  pWhen I fetch all codePersoncode objects from the database, something strange happens. All of the Person objects show up, but some of the codenamecode fields in the objects are somehow set to codenilcode. Only the objects where the persons role is Composer seem to have this issue.p  pWhat makes this so much of a problem is that I have verified that the names of these entities are in the sqlite file. I can print all objects at the end of the import program the one that creates the database and get the correct info. I also thought that perhaps the file system was doing something to the file when I copied it over, but I can open the sqlite file from the command line and manually get the names of composers there as well.p  pHas anyone had a similar problemp

My JS skills are admittedly not where I would like them to be, but Im sure this is a pretty easy one for someone with a little more experience I have setup a codepen as well as JSfiddle The goal is to toggle class open to the div navbarcontainer on clicking the dropdown li item productsp  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenaFtrL relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioanonpenaFtrLap  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnwT9c relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netnwT9cap  precodeHTML  ltheader idtop rolebannergt     ltdiv classblockgt                 lth1 classcentrifiguegtAbout Unico Nutrition Inc.lth1gt                 lta classnavbtn idnavopenbtn hrefnavgtlti classiconalignjustify iconlargegtltigtltagt             ltdivgt     ltheadergt              ltnav idnav rolenavigationgt             ltdiv classblockgt           ltdiv classnavbarcontainergt                       ltul classnav pullleftgt                       ltligt                         lta classbrand hrefindex.phpgtltdiv classbrandygtltimg srchttpwww.uniconutrition.comimageslogosimagesunicologowhite03.png altunico nutrition logogtltdivgtltagt                                          ltligt                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.twitter.comuniconutritiongtlti classsocial icontwittergtltigtltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.facebook.comuniconutritiongtlti classsocial iconfacebookgtltigtltagtltligt                      ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.pinterest.comuniconutritiongtlti classsocial iconpinterestgtltigtltagtltligt                           ltligtlta hrefhttpsplus.google.com112853492391070366802postsgtlti classsocial icongoogleplusgtltigtltagtltligt                          ltulgt                         ltul classnav pullrightgt                            ltligtlta hreffitnessbloggtFitBlog lti classiconchevronright gtltigtltagtltligt                           ltli classactivegtlta hrefaboutus.htmlgtAbout Us lti classiconchevronright gtltigtltagtltligt                           ltligtlta hrefcontact.htmlgtContact lti classiconchevronright gtltigtltagtltligt                           ltli classdropdowngt                             lta href classdropdowntoggle datatoggledropdowngtProducts ltb classcaretgtltbgtltagt                             ltul classdropdownmenugt                               ltli classnavheadergtWomensltligt                               ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.preworkoutforwomen.com        onclickgaq.push[link, httpwww.preworkoutforwomen.com] return falsegtTONED PreWorkout lti classiconchevronright gtltigtltagtltligt                               ltligtlta hrefgtltagtltligt                               ltligtlta hrefgtltagtltligt                               ltli classdividergtltligt                               ltli classnavheadergtMensltligt                               ltligtlta hrefgtComing Summer 2013 lti classiconchevronright gtltigtltagtltligt                               ltligtlta hrefgtltagtltligt                                 ltli classdividergtltligt                                  ltligtlta hrefproducts.htmlgtProducts Home lti classiconchevronright gtltigtltagtltligt                             ltulgt                           ltligt                                  ltform classnavbarsearch pullleft actionhttpstore.uniconutrition.comSearchResults.asp methodget nameSearchBoxFormgt                 ltinput typetext nameSearch classsearchquery span2 placeholderSearch valuesearch onfocusif this.value  search this.value   onblurif this.value   this.value  searchgt                 ltltinput typesubmit nameSubmit idsearchsubmit valuegt gt             ltformgt                             ltligtlta hrefhttpstore.uniconutrition.comgtShop lti classiconchevronright gtltigtltagtltligt                           ltulgt                   lta classclosebtn idnavclosebtn hreftopgtlti classiconremove iconlargegtltigtltagt             ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltnavgt   JS     bootstrapdropdown.js v2.3.2   httptwitter.github.combootstrapjavascript.htmldropdowns      Copyright 2012 Twitter, Inc.

Negative 77858 pI am trying to create a very simple CRUD App and I am unsure whats the best way to update and delete records. I am able to successfully list all records and create a new record. Now I would now like to delete these records through the app and it is not immediately clear on how I should do it. p  pLets say I have a Person table with just one field Name like so p  precodePerson     name Text codepre  pI have a handler called PersonR that lists all the persons in the table and a form to input a new one. For handling delete and update, I thought I can create a hidden field called code personId code and then process the form through an InputForm but I couldnt get the ID out easily. I tried code unKey personId code but it still has code PersistInt64 1code so I am presuming this is not the right way to go about it even if I manage to fish the ID out of there. p  pAnother approach I could take is create a new handler say ListPersons just to list all persons and then change the code Personcode handler to code PersonpersonId.code I prefer to avoid this if possible and keep all actions related to Person in one place if possible. p  pCould you please let me know if I am thinking about this right and any suggestions for implementing a basic CRUD App functionality p  pstrongUpdatestrong I ended up creating a code PersonPanelcode which will handle GET and POST. The codePersoncode Handler took care of DELETE and PUT. I ended up putting the 4 Handlers in the same Person handler file so it is not scattered around. Hope this helps others. p  pThanksp

Negative 77858 pIs it possible or recommended to compile amp execute C code on a database server Is there an application that allows a programmer to write C code from within PLSQLp  pIm thinking of ways to more efficiently perform statistical analyses on large datasets residing on my companys server. Rather than transmitting the dataset to my local machine which may take several hours in order to run a regression in SAS or R, it seems far more efficent to perform the anaysis on the server itself. This has the added benefit of taking advantage of the servers extra RAM and memory compared with my lowly PC.p  pId like to code the matrix algebra required for more complex regressions generalized linear models such as logistic regressions with random effects. Ive read in a few forums that SQL isnt the ideal language for performing matrix algebra much less statistical analysis. Other languages like SAS can access data on a server, but the data must be downloaded to my machine and the analysis itself is conducted on my PC rather than the server itself. Hence my interest in running C.p
Negative 77858 pI have an app that should be able to scan a lot of QR Codes in few minutes. So it has to be reactive. I use ZBarSDK and I am satisfied with it.p  pWhen data are received by the delegate with codeprocessScannedDataNSString scannedDatacode, I present a message that has to be manually dismissed. To be fast, I lock the focus at this distance by interacting with the emAVCaptureDeviceem assuming that next QR Codes will be presented at the same distance.p  pThis system works pretty well except in one situation  When I present my message after a scan, I dont stop the camera to avoid losing the focus I have just locked to. If you present the next QR Code below before dismissing the message, my codeprocessScannedDataNSString scannedDatacode delegate method will catch it and ignore the data as expected. The only problem is that if you dismiss the message at that point keeping the camera above the QR Code, data wont be received but the delegate method has already been fired, you will be forced to look for a few seconds at another point and then come back to your QR Code.p  pSo here is my question  is it possible to tell ZBar that I dont want him to fire the delegate method until I explicitly tell him to do so  Is it possible to stop processing data without stopping the camera p  pThank you for your helpp

Negative 77858 pThese are the requirements of the questionp  pCreate a PLSQL function called codefindtotalcarmodelscode to return the total number of cars belonging to a particular model. The function should have a emsingle  IN parameter asem codemodelnamecode. You should then use an explicit cursor to count the  number of cars belonging to that car model and return the final count. You must strongNOTstrong  use any implicit cursors, table joins, subqueries, set operators, group functions or SQL  functions such as COUNT to create this function.p  pNow, write ONE PLSQL anonymous block that provides a report about car details. The full specification to create the PLSQL anonymous block is as followsp  p Using an explicit cursor, retrieve all car registration, cost and model name  details registration, cost amp modelname from the codeICARcode table.p  p If the cost of the car is less than or equal to 50,000, we determine car cost  category as Budget Car. If the car cost is between 50,000 and 100,000,  the car cost category is Standard Car. For all other cars costing more than  100,000 the car cost category is Premium Car.

You will have to look at the  codedatereservedcode column from codeIBOOKINGcode table here. You cannot use the  codeMAXcode function.

And my project doesnt even have a global.asax file. Im not sure if I need to create that, or if it is deprecated, or if Ektron handles for me.p

Negative 77858 pIve reached a point where I would like to write an automated test to verify the content of a WPF View thats bound up to a View Model in a particular state. p  pIn concept, its fairly simple. Create a View Model, set its state, create the appropriate View, add the View to a Window, set the Data Context of the View, show the Window, take a screenshot, compare against a previously taken screenshot. This sort of test is useful to detect unintended changes, as well as verifying that all the View can actually be created without error.p  pHowever, creating an instance of my View is proving problematic. It requires a set of resources that are not included in the XAML definition itself. These resources are included in the Application level resource dictionary in the actual application, so by the time the View is created in the real application, those resources are already available to it.p  pWhen I create an instance of this View inside my test, it throws a XamlParseException about being unable to find various resources understandably.p  pI do not want to simply add appropriate resource dictionaries to the XAML definition of the View itself because this would increase the amount of effort computer effort required to create one of these View objects, as well as increasing the amount of memory required for each instance. My understanding is that this is a result of ResourceDictionarys not being shared in that way.p  pI have triedp  ul liCreating an instance of App.xaml inside the test which sets the Application.Current property.li liSetting the Application.Current.Resources property to the the Resources property of an instance of App.xaml.li liSetting the Resources property of the Page directly.li liSetting the Resources property of the Window directly the Window the Page is being added to for the test.li ul  pstrongEssentially, I need to know if there is a way to engineer a situation where I can configure a set of Application resources for standalone instances of WPF components to use inside an automated test.strongp  pYou can reproduce the problem by creating the following structure, with everything but the ViewTest.cs file in one project, and the ViewTest.cs file living in a test project. Run the app and it works. Run the test and it fails.p  pApp.xamlp  precodeltApplication      xClassBlah.App             xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     StartupUriMainWindow.xamlgt     ltApplication.Resourcesgt         ltResourceDictionarygt             ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt                 ltResourceDictionary SourceStyles.xaml gt             ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt         ltResourceDictionarygt     ltApplication.Resourcesgt ltApplicationgt codepre  pStyles.xamlp  precodeltResourceDictionary      xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlgt     ltSolidColorBrush xKeySpecialBrush ColorBlack gt ltResourceDictionarygt codepre  pMainWindow.xamlp  precodeltWindow      xClassBlah.MainWindow     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnsBlahclrnamespaceBlah     TitleMainWindow Height350 Width525gt     ltGridgt         ltBlahViewgt     ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre  pView.xamlp  precodeltUserControl      xClassAutomatedTestUserControlApplicationResources.View     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006      xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008      mcIgnorabled      dDesignHeight300 dDesignWidth300gt     ltGrid BackgroundStaticResource SpecialBrushgt      ltGridgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pViewTest.csp  precodeusing System using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting using Blah using System.Windows  namespace Blah.Test      [TestClass]     public class ViewTest              [TestMethod]         public void Test                      var view  new View              var window  new Window             window.Content  view              window.ShowDialog                codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI had some luck with creating an extra constructor for the View in question that takes a ResourceDictionary, as a way to inject the View with some context for its initialization. This constructor overload is only used for tests, in the real application the resource context is already available from the Application resources.p  precodepublic ViewResourceDictionary resourceContext  null      if resourceContext  null Resources.MergedDictionaries.AddresourceContext     InitializeComponent  codepre  pThis solves the specific example that I posted above in a way that is not dependent on initializing unrelated objects just to get the View to work which flies in the face of good dependency injection practices.p  pHowever, it brought to light some additional problems when I tried to implement it in my actual project. My resource context at the Application level is actually the merge of 4 different resource dictionaries, the latter of which are dependent on the earlier in that they reference resources specified in an earlier entry.p  pAppResources.xamlp  precodeltResourceDictionary      xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlgt     ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt         ltResourceDictionary SourceStyleGlobalColour.xamlgt         ltResourceDictionary SourceStyleGlobalBrush.xamlgt lt Dependent on GlobalColourgt         ltResourceDictionary SourceStyleGlobalStyle.xamlgt         ltResourceDictionary SourceResourcesGlobalContent.xamlgt     ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt ltResourceDictionarygt codepre  pCreating a ResourceDictionary from this file in my test project, and then injecting that ResourceDictionary into my View during construction throws a XamlParseException relating to a StaticResource not being found the resource that cant be found lives in GlobalBrush, and is dependent on an entry in GlobalColour.p  pIll update as I explore further.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI had absolutely no luck manually creating and using the AppResources ResourceDictionary above. I could not get the interdependencies between dictionaries in the MergedDictionaries to work. I couldnt even manually flatten the ResourceDictionary instance, because when I tried to access a resource in a dictionary that was dependent on a resource in a parallel dictionary it threw a XamlParseException.p  pAs a result, the idea of injecting a ResourceDictionary into the View via a constructor was not feasible for use in my solution although it works if the app resources are a flat ResourceDictioanry.p  pAt the end of this journey, I have come to the conclusion that the only way to instantiate a View where the xaml does not directly contain references to the resources without having to instantiate the entire App is include references to the appropriate ResourceDictionary wherever a resource is used, directly in the xaml. You then have to manage the performance issues at run time because youre instantiating hundreds of duplicate ResourceDictionaries by using a SharedResourceDictionary there are a number of implementations of this concept available on the internet.p

The core for speech processing is in C, the remainder is in C with Qt  the audio is handled via portaudio. The connection between users is currently established via UDP, which I think has to be changed for the planned video connection. Developing platform is Windows on VS2012  however, the system is crossplatform.p  pIn a nutshell, what I want to do is Grab the video signal from a webcam, synchronize audio coming from C core and video from webcam and use a library and codecs for decodingmuxing the signals on the respective sides and sending via RTP. The system should be capable of multicast transmission.p  pI did some research for possible libraries and stumbled upon ffmpeg and libVLC. For the codec I thought about using x264. And if Im correct, ffmpeg and libVLC should both be capable of what Im looking forp  pHowever Im not sure which one to pick, and from their documentations I really cant extract, which library is the better fit. Has anybody had similar problems and can help me out  Im quite a newbie, when it comes to video processing and encoding.p  pExtra question Do you have any hints or approaches on syncing the video and audio signalsp

Negative 77858 pCurrently Im using Parse.com in order to create multiple ParseUsers. This works perfectly and each user can login individually. However from here I want to expand my app to allow Users to create groups of users and therefore have data that is only relevant and shared between these Users.

Negative 77858 pWriting a Compute Shader to be used in Unity 4. Im attempting to get 3d noise. p  pstrongThe goal is to get a multidiminsional float3 array into my compute shader from my C code.

Negative 77858 pI just solved a recent problem where Json.Net allows me to include the type of an object when it serializes it going to the Client.  The reason for this is that the class that Im sending back and forth has a property that is typed as a BaseClass to 4 Subclasses.  The great thing now is that my client is showing each one correctly with the type attribute on the Json.p  pNow I need to send the object back to my Controller, not to an API controller.  Ive seen a bunch of posts about the api controller using Json.Net as the default JsonFormatter, but this doesnt work for a regular MVC Controller.p  pSo my question is....How can I get my Controller to use the Json.Net Serializer by default  And...will this cause an issue for other items potentially making ajax callsp  pI was able to send my json back to my controller as a string and then use JsonConvert to Deserialize my object successfully, so I know it can be done.p  pAny thoughts are appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ok, so I followed the instructions a hrefhttpwww.dalsoft.co.ukblogindex.php20120110aspnetmvc3improvedjsonvalueproviderfactoryusingjsonnet relnofollowherea to change out the JsonValueProviderFactory and that seems to be working, however its not helping the original issue.p  pThe problem is that the JsonFormatter is still the old one and not using Json.Net.  So the ProviderFactory is building the dictionary correctly, but when it tries to Deserialize my object, Im only getting my properties cast as the BaseClass, and not the Derived Class that Im expecting.  p  pThoughts on that part p  pstrongEDITstrong Simply...how do I create my own JsonNetMediaTypeFormatter in MVC4  Ive changed the ProviderFactory, but that only changes how each individual parameter is serialized to its corresponding value.  What I need to do is to use Json.Net so that my Parameters that are typed as a Hierarchy is serialized to the correct derived class...not typed as the Baseclass.p  pstrongEdit  Laststrong Ok...so I did verify that if I call an ApiController, it maps the incoming parameter with the correct subclass.  So, I can go this route, but Id really like to find a way to have the same result with my regular Controller.p

I would like to display empty JTable when the application starts  and call the WebRequest only by clicking strongJMenuItemstrong refresh button.p  pHow to approach it At the moment my only idea is to have strongJTablestrong data model and call a one of its methods  something like coderefreshcode. This method should call strongWebRequeststrong and update strongJTablestrong. But for this I have to get from strongJMenuItemstrong to strongJTablestrong that is in completely different place.p  pWhat can be better approach here Again  there can be only one Data model to call in the app  so maybe a similliar problem to Problem 1p  hr  pAlso if you know a good reading on design patters, or good open source repos to study  I would really appreciate any suggestions.p
Negative 77858 pI ported a Java web application which used JDK 1.5 and ran under Tomcat 5.5 to now use JDK 1.7 and running under Tomcat 7. I am tasked with developing a Java batch program that will be scheduled. Many of the classes used by the batch process are also used by the web app as well.p  pTen years ago I wrote a batch process to use concurrent scheduler. What are some ways today to implement a scheduled batch process using the environment I mentioned abovep  pstrongEditstrong It has been suggested that I use quartz or ScheduledExecutorService. After taking a look at both of those solutions, I think they may provide more than what I need. At the moment, there exists a batch process that is basically a Java program scheduled to run as a Windows NT Server scheduled task and this approach works well enough for the existing batch process. The new batch process that I will develop can follow this approach as well but next I have a deployment question. The .class files and the .properties and the .jar files used by the batch process are in a separate folder from the web application in webapps.

Negative 77858 pI have a little div tag that when I click it codeonClickcode event, it will run the codeprintMousePoscode function.

Negative 77858 pSo, Ive been struggling with this for some time, but to no avail. My research didnt help much, either. Here it is I built a test to prevent people to go to the alter page of an module by typing the address directly in the url without the id of the registry to be altered therefore causing trouble in the DB. Simply put, it searches for the id passed as parameter in the url in the DB if it has a match, it proceeds, if not, I redirect to the main module page with an error message passed via flashdata. I use a similar process to impede the insertionalteration of registries if a field from a different table is not defined as it is required in both in order to work, as the tables are related. A rough example of what Im doing in the Controller isp  precodeifisnumericid searchthisgtmodelfoogtsearchid else    thisgtsessiongtsetflashdataerrormessage,not numeric   redirectmyurlindex,refresh  ifsearchgtnumrows0    thisgtsessiongtsetflashdataerrormessage,not found   redirectmyurlindex,refresh  searchthisgtmodelfoo2gtlist if searchgtnumrows0    thisgtsessiongtsetflashdataerrormessage,other table empty   redirectmyurlindex,refresh  codepre  pAnd my view index is like thisp  precodeltphp  errorthisgtsessiongtflashdataerrormessage  successthisgtsessiongtflashdatasuccessmessage successmessage goes after a successful insetupdate  if errorecho error gt codepre  pSo here is the issue the success messages show up normally I checked and double checked, they are being declared in the Controller the exact same way the error ones, as well as the not numeric one, but not the not found and other table empty ones. Im really confused by this one, since the flashdata seems to work in some instances and not in others, which is specially weird given the flashdata are being declared in pretty much the same way...  Sorry if I wasnt clear enough, this is my first post here, so try to be patient D Thanks in advance for any help in this matter. p  pEDIT Found out the source of the issue. It was something with my browsers cache storage. Rebooted my machine and cleaned the cache and the output worked like a charm. Thanks for all the help. p

Negative 77858 pI currently have a custom codeUITableViewCellcode with a number of labels in it. Not all of those labels will necessarily have a value but they could do  and they may be multiline At least 2 labels will always be visible. If there isnt any text then the label should collapse. What Im trying to achieve is that each label only takes up the height it needs and they all butt up to each other. Ive got all of this working, except I finally want a bottom margin of 11 between the last label and the cells content view with the cell height adjusted accordingly. This is the only bit where I cant seem to get my emconstraintsem working correctly.p  pI correctly return the right height by creating a dummy cell, and in my codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode method I try to set the cell and the cells contentview frame accordingly. But the cell height that is rendered on the screen is always the same as it was defined in the xib.p  pI know theres a lack of code here, but all my emconstraintsem have been define in IB and each label has a trailing and leading space for with and a top space of 0 to the label above it.

Negative 77858 pI have a desktop app that Im in the process of porting to a Django webapp. The app has some quite computationally intensive parts using numpy, scipy and pandas, among other libraries. Obviously importing the computationally intensive code into the webapp and running it isnt a great idea, as this will force the client to wait for a response. p  pTherefore, youd have to farm these tasks out to a background process that notifies the client via AJAX, I guess andor stores the results in the database when its complete. p  pYou also dont want all these tasks running in simultaneously in the case of multiple concurrent users, since that is a great way to bring your server to its knees even with a small number of concurrent requests. Ideally, you want each instance of your webapp to put its tasks into a job queue, that then automagically runs them in an optimal way based on number of cores, available memory, etc..p  pAre there any good Python libraries to help resolve this sort of an issue Are there general strategies that people use in these kinds of situations Or is this just a matter of choosing a good batch scheduler and spawning a new Python interpreter for each processp
Negative 77858 pThere are many similar question on SO about this, but I havent been able to find an answer that clearly lists the differences in aliasing, so I am asking here.p  pI know that a simple primitive assignment statement copies valuesp  precodeint x  1 int y  x x  2 StdOut.printx  prints 2 StdOut.printy  prints 1 codepre  pThen I was told that arrays are aliased during assignment statements. Sop  precodeint[] x  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 int[] y  x x[0]  6 StdOut.printx[0]  prints 6 StdOut.printy[0]  prints 6 codepre  pHowever, if you assign one of the variables a completely different array, this aliasing disappearsp  precodeint[] x  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 int[] y  x x  new int[]1, 2, 3, 4, 5 x[0]  6 StdOut.printx[0]  prints 1 StdOut.printy[0]  prints 6 codepre  pWhat is the reason for thisp  pThen, I come to reference types. When using assignment statements, it is the reference which is copied, not the value. Sop  precodeCounter c1  new Counterones Counter c1.incrememnt  0 gt 1 Counter c2  c1 c2.increment StdOut.printc1  prints 2 StdOut.printc2  prints 2 codepre  pBut what about if I then assign codec1code to a new codeCountercode object What happens to codec2code does it reference the original codeCountercode or the new codeCountercode, whyp  pI ask because I originally thought that reference types worked like arrays. If I create a new codeCountercode and assign it to codec1code, then both codec1code and codec2code point to the newly created codeCountercode. However, after going through some exercises, I created an iterable codeStackcode ADT which seems to violate this assumption. My code is belowp  precodeimport java.util.Iterator  public class MyStackltItemgt implements IterableltItemgt       private Node first  top of stack     private int N  number of items      private class Node          Item item         Node next           public MyStack       public IteratorltItemgt iterator          return new ListIterator           private class ListIterator implements IteratorltItemgt           private Node current  first          public boolean hasNext              return current  null                   public Item next              Item item  current.item             current  current.next             return item                     public void pushItem item          Node oldfirst  first         first  new Node         first.item  item         first.next  oldfirst         N           public Item pop          ifisEmpty              Node oldfirst  first             first  first.next             return oldfirst.item          else throw new RuntimeExceptionStack underflow           public boolean isEmpty  return size  0       public int size  return N       public static void mainString[] args          MyStackltIntegergt stack  new MyStackltgt         stack.push5         stack.push6         stack.push7         stack.push8         stack.push9         forint i  stack              StdOut.printlni                 codepre  pIts a simple implementation, using a linked list data structure for the items. The main instance variable is codefirstcode, which holds the first node in the linked list top of the stack. If you look in the nested codeListIteratorcode class, theres an instance variable codecurrentcode which is assigned to codefirstcode. Now, in the codepushcode method, codefirstcode is reassigned to a newly created codeNodecode. Surely then the codecurrentcode variable is still assigned to the old codefirstcode Node Why then does this implementation work p  pMy hunch is that either a I dont understand how reference values are passed please explain or b when you run through the codeforcode loop in the main method, it implicitly calls creates a new codeListIteratorcode which, at that point, assigns codecurrentcode to whatever the current value of codefirstcode is. If this is the real reason, then does that mean that a new iterator should be created whenever a method is called within the class For example, if I create the iterator explicitly, then push a few items to the stack, and then reuse the iterator without reinitialising  will it work as intendedp  pPlease explainp

Negative 77858 pI am developing a project in a team. I am using XCode 6 beta 7 but other members are using XCode 5.1p  pWe can all open and run the same project in both the versions of XCode  5.1 and 6 beta 7 .p  pOn eof my project mates who is working on XCode 5.1 has some integer variables in his code that he is initializing as nil. The code compiles properly in his XCode 5.1 properly and runs fine. However when I run the same code in XCode 6 beta 7, I get a semantic issue when compiling the code.p  pExact error message   Semantic Issue Assigning to NSInteger aka long from incompatible type nullptrt .p  pIf I iniialize those variables with zero, the code compiles and runs fine.p  pI discussed this with an expert and he said that they should remain as nil instead of zero cuz if we iniialize them with zero, the values remain in memory and that might create a memory hog in the future.p  pWhat should I do, how should I solve this problem.

Negative 77858 pI want to make a game similar to galaga in xna using C.  I have two types of enemies behavior and sprite are different, as well as sound effects, and I want each to have their own rows.  I was earlier using arrays to generate enemies on screen, but apparently this isnt a good approach and was told I should use lists instead.  Now, I was thinking there could be a few of ways of creating the enemy classes themselves.  One was using inheritance, with a base class of Enemy, and then two other classes that inherit from Enemy but have their own behavior and sprite.  Another way of doing this would be to create an enemy interface.  And one other way of setting this up would be to use structs.  I think using interface would be more time consuming compared to the other two, but I could be wrong if I am, let me know.  The other two I am not sure about though.  Technically, I believe they both use classes, just one uses structs.  What would be the better way of doing this, inheriting from an enemy class, or using an enemy struct  p

Negative 77858 pThis is a pretty specific onep  pI have two tables codet1code and codet2code  codet1code is my allperson table, where everybody in my database and all their data is housed, and codet2code is my much smaller table of people who are actually going to do the work of talking to the people in codet1code.p  pAs you can see in this sample stronga hrefhttpwww.sqlfiddle.com2eda857 relnofollowSQL Fiddleastrong, the people in codet1code each have specific criteria assigned to them age, rating, and team. My endresult will hopefully be for every one worker in codet2code, the query will return strong2strong specific people from codet1code if their teams match the idea behind this is that Im matching the workers in codet2code to the person theyre going to talk to in codet1code based on their team.p  pBut what makes it trickier is that there are two more sets of criteria that I want the query to satisfy alsop  ol liOnly return people from codet1code if their age is in between 30 and 60 everybody outside of those ageranges should be ignored li liemAndem if theres more than two people that fit the above criteria, return the ones with the best rating first. For example, if there are four people on a team and we only need two  so the query should return the two with the best ratings, which would be whichever ratings closer to 100.li ol  pThe final thing that is difficult to wrap my head around is that there are multiple workers per team as well  so if theres two codet2code workers on Team A, the query should return four distinct codet1code people on Team A two attached to one worker and two attached to another and like I said above, they should be the four best rated people [though it doesnt matter which two people goes to which worker.p  pMy hopeful output will look something like the following for all teamsp  precodeID t1   Person t1   Team t1   Worker t2 539184    Smith, Jane   Team A      Smith, Bob 539186    Smith, Jim    Team A      Smith, Bob 537141    Smith, Danny  Team A      Smith, Bill 537162    Smith, James  Team A      Smith, Bill Etc. codepre  pIn reality, Im doing something similar to this with tens of thousands of records  which is why this is the only way I can imagine doing it, but I barely even know where to start.

I do not want to change the git code at all  I just need to import it into my code so that I can call its methods.p  pThe git repository is all set up in Eclipse I think. But I cant figure out how to get my code to see it. Ive tried importing JAR files, libraries, etc., but am not successful. Every tutorial I find just shows how to publish my own file to git, but not how to use a thirdparty repository. p  pIf someone can refer me to an existing resource or question, thats fine too.

Negative 77858 pI did a lot of searching and could not find an answer and hence stuck. I just wish to know whether it was possible to define gradient stops from our data rather than percentages.

So as you can see I want the gradient to change whenever the y value matches the x axis value at 5 , 2 and 1. This plot changes based on the user input. Hence the 5, 2 and 1 are never in the same position. So is there a way I can convert the positions into percentages to use them in the gradient or do I create 3 separate area paths with specified colors  p  pI have included the vertical gridlines as I thought it would be clear to understand.p

It should, however, codeconnect init filecode instead. p  pthe codeinit filescode exists  I checked. p  pIve tried making this a source folder on the codeProject Structurecode window in PyCharms preferences to no avail. p  pSo I removed codeselenium.pyccode via the terminal with codesudo rm rf selenium.pyccode hoping that it would default to the codeinit filecode, reran it again, and came to find that PyCharm attempted to import codeselenium.pycode. Deleting this file in addition removing codeselenium.pyccode basically kills the entire module.   p  pIm fairly new at this and have been at this problem for 3 days, and will not stop till I figure this out. What else should I do If you really dont want to answer this question, could you at least recommend me a book or website that would help me solve these problemsp  pP.s. I have a mac.p

Negative 77858 pId like to implement some kind of simple yet as strong as possible encryption for my clientserver application network traffic. Data to be encrypted can be both textual, and binary.p  pNow Im thinking about using just a trivial XOR encryption, but with following featuresp  ul liKey will be random i.e. uniformly distributed random sequence of bytes for each session.li liCBC mode with random IV will be used for each session. That is, plaintext will be XORed with previous ciphertext or in case of first block  the IV, and the result will then be XORed with repeating sequences of encryption key. That way the attacks mentioned in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1135186whatswrongwithxorencryptionWhats wrong with XOR encryptiona will not be possible, rightli ul  pSo my question is how strong is such encryption Many points mentioned in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1135186whatswrongwithxorencryptionWhats wrong with XOR encryptiona questions answers will not be valid I think, as the random IV will ensure that the plaintext patterns e.g. spaces, NULL bytes, etc. will not be observable, and the ciphertext will look more random.p  pWhat are the weaknesses of such encryption Thanksp  pemP.S. I know that for ultimate security, implementing TLS with e.g. OpenSSL would be the way to go, but I dont actually need that level of theoretically unbreakable security, using certificates and big libs like OpenSSL is just overkill for my project. I just need simplest possible defense against somebody wiresharking my traffic.emp

Negative 77858 pIm making a Pay Check calculator.  However, for some reason the calculation doesnt get exported accurately to the label.  I narrowed down the miscalculation to my IF ELSE statements.

But I need something simpler that always scrolls to the same div ProductList when the select boxes are clicked. p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdavidThomasQD2xs1 relnofollowThis Example works for id selected but i need a general one that scrolls to one specific div idap  precodevar select  document.getElementByIdtest  select.onchange  function var id  this.getElementsByTagNameoption[this.selectedIndex].value,     el  document.getElementByIdid,     top  el.offsetTop window.scrollTo0,top  codepre  pAny help is hugely appreciatedp  pFrankp

Negative 77858 pIm successfully streaming data from mongodb, using a mongodb river into elasticsearch and being displayed in Kibana.p  pThe problem Im facing is that I have fields using a numeric id value but it means nothing the user looking at the kibana dashboards.p  pFor example, I have a key in mongodb called Grade. These are the following values and the associated grade level I want to display in Kibanap  precodeValue    Grade Level   0      Normal   1      Noncritical   2      Critical   3      Unavailable codepre  pIm unable to modify how the source of this data is being written to the database.  Also, the data is constantly streaming so periodicallymanually updating fields in mongodb or elasticsearch is not going to work.  p  pThis seems like a simple issue but it not clear to me as to where I can address the problem.  Im not sure if the problem can be addressed at any specific level mongodb, mongodb river, or elasticserach with a mapping or script.  Note that there many more numeric codes in addition to my above example so I would also like to avoid using any aliasing at the kibana level.p  pAny suggestion on where and how to address this issuep  pThank youp

But when youre dealing with a struct,   you might be passing by reference, in which the type is myStruct, or   you might be passing by value, in which the type is just myStruct. If,   on the other hand, the thing youre dealing with is just an   interface, you never have a pointer to it  strongan interface is a pointerstrong   strongin some sensestrong.

Negative 77858 pIve inherited a geodatabase of polygons of lakes for which I am trying to create sampling grids on each lake. My current strategy is to export spatial data to CSV, use R to run a loop to create the grids on each lake, and then write to a new shapefile. However, here is my problem, when exporting to a CSV the WKT strings get messed up and put onto different lines. Okay, no problem, I moved on to exporting just the geometry to CSV so that I get XY values. When I simply plot the points they look perfect using plotyx, but the points are not in order. So, when I transform the data to a codeSpatialPolygoncode in the codespcode package in R using the following sequencep  precodeXYpoints gt Polygon gt Polygons gt SpatialPolygon codepre  pand then plot the codeSpatialPolygoncode I get thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsrV6r.jpg altenter image description herep  pI know this is an artifact of incorrectly ordered points, because when I order the points by X and then by Y and run the same procedure here is what I getp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLk4ss.jpg altenter image description herep  pThis is what the correct plotting is supposed to look like XY data plotted with open circlesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comosaLf.jpg altenter image description herep  pHere is a short reproducible example of what I am trying to deal withp  precodelibrarysp  correct polygon data lt data.framexc110, 101, yc51, 110, 106  plotyx, datadata correct.data.points lt rbinddata, data[1,]  to close the ring for a polygon correct.data.coords lt as.matrixcbindcorrect.data.points correct.data.poly lt Polygoncorrect.data.coords, holeF correct.data.poly lt Polygonslistcorrect.data.poly, ID0 correct.data.poly.sp lt SpatialPolygonslistcorrect.data.poly plotcorrect.data.poly.sp    incorrect polygon scr.data lt data[csample120,]  plotyx, datascr.data scr.data.points lt rbindscr.data, scr.data[1,]  to close the ring for a polygon scr.data.coords lt as.matrixcbindscr.data.points scr.data.poly lt Polygonscr.data.coords, holeF scr.data.poly lt Polygonslistscr.data.poly, ID0 scr.data.poly.sp lt SpatialPolygonslistscr.data.poly plotscr.data.poly.sp codepre  pAny thoughts Thanks for any help or insight anyone can provide.

Negative 77858 pIm new to Angular and am implementing something that requires a large ngrepeat loop. Of all the things in the loop Im only showing one however. I show it using ngif ngif over ngshow so as to remove all other elements from the DOM. My question is if I have considerable amounts of data inside the elements whos ngif statements dont evaluate to true, for example some images or very big tables, is that data still downloaded by a user accessing the page with the ngrepeat and ngif statements on I.e If I had my ngrepeat repeating 10 times and each time generating a div containing a 100,000 row table, even though only one of the tables shown via the use of ngif, are all of the other tables evaluated and so downloaded by the user This is in the interest of bandwidth.p  pI hope that made sense.

Negative 77858 pI dont do much client side web programming, so Im trying to grasp this concept in how it relates to my specific situation.p  pI have a RESTful WCF service running on a port in the 50000s.  Additionally, I have a bunch of web forms not ASP WebForms written in HTML5CSS3JavaScript that make AJAX calls to this WCF service.  The web forms are hosted on the same host, but are using port 80.  The AJAX calls made by the web forms are all codeGETcode only requests.p  pAdditionally, I have a thirdparty cloudhosted application thats in a completely different location different host, which needs to call the WCF service as well.  This communication is performing codePOSTcodes amp codePUTcodes to the WCF service.p  pObviously the calls being made from the thirdparty hosted cloud application is  cross origin.  From my research it appears that the different ports are in fact different origins.  p  pI know that security amp CORS are different concepts, but here is what Im trying to accomplish and I need to better understand how all of this worksbr  Right now I allow all crossorigin requests, and everything is working, but Id like to limit it down to improve security and then eventually set up HTTPS with transport security with both the webforms amp WCF service using the same certificate.  The thirdparty cloud service hostedapp would still need to be able to communicate with the WCF service so I would need to allow it to authenticate differently, so that would be done with a secretkey being passed since everything is serverside only.p  pThis whole communication triangle feels murky to me, and I hope that SO is the right place for me to be posting this question since it isnt directly code related.p  ol liIs the WCF  web forms situation described above considered crossoriginli listrongAstrong If the above is not crossorigin, would I then only need to pass the codeAccessControlAllowOrigin httpsmycloudhostcode in my web.configbr br  strongBstrong If it is I understand that just need to echo back the allowed originss in the header.

Negative 77858 pI am using ASP.NET Web API to create a RESTful API. A typical controller is requesting entities from my repository using LINQ to objects. My repository is not using Entity Framework and does not access any database. Instead, it uses external RESTFul services for data access.

Negative 77858 pHello I am working on a project of cache simulator. I have read almost all articles on internet and many research papers. my theoretical concepts are well but the issue is I am unable to code what a theoretically read. I have coded its most of the parameters like cache size, block size, main memory size and mapping. It is giving me an accurate answers of what will be index, offset and tag bits. But I am stuck at how to code for miss rate and hit rate I am making trace driven simulator which uses instruction for read, write and fetch. Specifically if it is the read instruction from where it will read or for write from what source it will write Can anyone please help me to suggest what gap is missing in my informationp

Negative 77858 pI have an application which uses SQLite directly, but now I would like to migrate to using a ContentProvider, also locally, as I want to use CursorLoader and search suggestions. But I have a question about transactions.p  pIn my app, a part of the workflow is to import a possibly huge data set into the database, atomically. The data that I want to import comes from a custom text format which I streamparse kind of like SAX I dont parse the whole file and keep it in memory rather, I can parse line by line and when an entity is discovered an insert is issues. The entities form a 3level hierarchical structure. Up until now, I have been using plain SQlite and transactions when importparsing began, I started the tx, and after it was finished, I would rollback or commit it. This way I was sure it was atomic, i.e. any error in the input file would not result in garbage in the database.p  pWith content providers, the problem is not so simple. I cant start my own transaction easily I cant use bulkInsert because I need to use back references for child entities, which means I need to use the applyBatch method and override it to start and end the transaction, as I require it. The problem is that it requires an ArrayList of operations, and I just dont know how many there would be, and dont want to keep them all in memory at once.p  pMaybe I can use the ContentProvider for normal db access, but the plain SQLiteOpenHelper for data import But then, it is possible that two helpers are open and use the database the reads and imports are async at the same time, which would result in an exception saying two processes use the same database dont remember the exact exception type. I also cant pass my own helper to the content provider.p  pSo, what I could do it to use the ContentProviderClient.getLocalContentProvider as I know it is mine, and use its implementation details  either fetch the sqliteopen helper it uses, or use the methods to start and finish transactions. This seems to be the best solution to me, if it works.p  pHow is this normally donep

Problem is when i have about 4000 items every item has about 10 values it takes sometimes about 710 minutes depends on the number of items to finish the whole progress. The screen is blocked via the codeBlockUI.jscode tool external code.p  pFor a better respond i want to have progress informations in this blocked screen.

Negative 77858 pI go nuts on that layout. So heres what Im trying to achieve. A simple layout having a label TextView or edit field EditText on the left side and a button on the right side. I want all labels and all buttons vertically adjusted  meaning all buttons of the same width and all labels too. p  pBut how to do this I tried a LinearLayout with vertical orientation and each line as another LinearLayout with horizontal orientation and inside that the label has a layoutweight of 8 and the button is 1. But still this does not guarantee what I wantp  pThis is the current result. You can see that the buttons are not nicely aligned.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comN8IsE.png altthe current resultp  pThis is my layoutp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeHpKj.png altthe current layoutp  pHeres the XMLp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid               androidorientationvertical               androidlayoutwidthmatchparent               androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltLinearLayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidorientationhorizontalgt          ltEditText                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidgravitycentervertical                 androidhinttesttestblabla                 androidlayoutweight8                 androidtextSize24sp                 androidfontFamilysansserifthin                 androidlayoutgravityleft                 gt          ltButton                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidhintstringactionscan                 androidtextSize24sp                 androidfontFamilysansserifthin                 androidlayoutweight1                 androidlayoutgravityright                 gt      ltLinearLayoutgt      ltLinearLayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidorientationhorizontalgt          ltTextView                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightmatchparent                 androidgravitycentervertical                 androidtext1735                 androidlayoutweight8                 androidtextSize24sp                 androidfontFamilysansserifthin                 androidlayoutgravityleft                 gt          ltButton                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidhintstringactionpicktime                 androidtextSize24sp                 androidfontFamilysansserifthin                 androidlayoutweight1                 androidlayoutgravityright                 gt      ltLinearLayoutgt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 77858 pI am trying to set up a a hrefhttplucene.apache.orgsolr relnofollowsolra collection that extends across multiple servers. If I am correct in understanding things, I am able to set up a collection, which consists of shards. Those shards consist of replicas, which is correspond to cores. Please correct any holes in my understanding of this.p  pOk.p  pSo Ive got solr set up and am able to create a collection on machine one by doing this.p  precodebinsolr createcollection c testcollection shards 2 replicationFactor 2 d serversolrconfigsetsbasicconfigsconf codepre  pThis appears to do something right, I am able to check the health and see something. I inputp  precodebinsolr healthcheck c testcollection codepre  pand I see the shard information.p  pNow what I want to do, and this is the part I am stuck on, is to take this collection that I have created, and extend it across multiple servers. Im not sure if I understand how this works correctly, but I think what I want to do is put shard1 on machine1, and shard2 on machine2. p  pI cant really figure out how to do this based on the documentation, although I am pretty sure this is what SolrCloud is meant to solve. Can someone give me a nudge in the right direction with this... Either a way to extend the collection across multiple servers or a reason for not doing so.p

Negative 77858 pI have a little WPF application with a ComboBox where the user can choose from a list of items. I also have a ListBox where I want the available items in the ListBox to depend on which item is currently selected in the ComboBox.p  pSay the ComboBox has the following options Fruits and Vegetables. If I select Fruits, the ListBox will contain Apple, Banana, Pear etc, and if I select Vegetables it will contain Carrot, Potato etc.p  pThis is just a fictional example, but covers what I need. In my app  both the data for the ComboBox and whatever is to be put in the ListBox will come from an external data source. p  pHow can I do this I have already done the binding of my view model to the view and populated the ComboBox from the data source, but I need the content of the ListBox to reflect the selected option in the ComboBox.p  pI appreciate any help p  pThanksp
Negative 77858 pI want to enable https listener for my ELB. All my instances are launched by autoscaling one master instance.p  pNormally if we are not under an ELB, an nginx server block would be listening to 80 with no sslcertificate entries, or listening to port 443 ssl with sslcertificates.p  pGoing over AWS documentation, it doesnt not answer me the following questionsp  p1 By default, when HTTPS is selected as a load balancer protocol, the instance protocol would be HTTP. Why is that Dont we need to secure the connection between the ELB and instancesp  p2 I already have multiple certificates. Wildcard ones and ones for single subdomains, as well as selfsigned certificates. How do I move them to the three blocks which AWS allows me to edit Private Key, Public Key Certificate and Certificate Chain. p  p3 Next, do I remove the SSL configuration in my server blocks if the instance protocol is going to be HTTP Should it listen to port 80p

Negative 77858 pOdoo released its website framework which is very easy and powerful.  Great thanks to Odoo Team  p  pNow we all Odoo experts need to think on whether a Website framework can be good alternative for POS p  pstrongWebsite benefits are listed as below,strongp  ul liIts very easy to add amp Integrate third party CSS and JS in Website.li liYou can make your custom design quickly in Website compare to POS.li liPOS developed because the purpose of it was, some of the user friendly features not possible  difficult over back end side, so Odoo team has developed custom POS framework with specific JS amp CSS. But as of now, since website framework released, you can easily add all the custom front end features so why there is need for POS framework li liThough website framework is dependent on Qweb templates, if POS can be move over website framework then it will be easy for end users to make quick changes on POS too. Because Qweb templates are more easy to handle with.  We are very much aware on the fact that in Odoo V9, POS is moved on Qweb templates. li liWebsite menus are also secured by user wise Access rights so I dont think there will be any kind of problem with authentication.  User wise login and different actions li liPOS changes are very difficult because that framework is somehow based on Web framework of Odoo. So definitely any custom design will be hard to implement compare to website framework.li liWebsite page can also work in Offline mode if JS is designed like that. So that is also not a problem in case of POS can be moved to website.li ul  pJust like,p  blockquote   pExample 1  Odoo deprecated RML and moved its reporting structure to   Qweb framework, it will be good to say bye bye to POS framework and   merge it into website framework.p      pExample 2  As Odoo given the feature of barcode scanning from website   for Delivery Orders and Incoming Shipment, if POS is from website   framework, then it will be easy to integrate it with Barcode scanning.p blockquote  p However we havent any problem or neither we are against with POS framework but as Odoo is growing day by day, one type of development framework will be easy to manage rather then separate frameworks like POS and website. p  pAny suggestions will be appreciated.p

Negative 77858 pI have searched around and there have been several questions on this issue, but none of them seem to fit my context. p  pI am working on an algorithm for image segmentation in Python, using the anaconda distribution. In the beginning stages of the algorithm, a weight matrix must be calculated, to give the weights of the edges between every pixel of an image using the pixels as nodes in a weighted graph data structure. Obviously, this results in a matrix of a huge size, codeimageWidth  imageHeight2code. This takes a very long time to build for larger and larger images, so a while back I implemented a couple of functions to build the matrix using all cpus on the machine. p  pThis has worked perfectly fine for me for weeks during testing. However, our algorithm has been steadily improving, and it is now ready to test on some real data gathered from an xray microscope.

Negative 77858 pGood day, I was working on an Android application that scales user input so I can use a dial to visually represent where the input is from a certain scale. p  pIve encountered something interesting. What I was doing was I multiplied the user input by 65 to come up with the angle that the dial needs to be in to correspond to the user input. However, it seemed like there was something wrong with the angle I was getting so I decided to log these statementsp  precodeLog.e, current speed    currentSpeed Log.e, raw results    65currentSpeed codepre  pAnd what was happening was that the currentSpeed seemed to be getting multiplied by 1. I then tried to use the decimal form of 65 which was 1.2, and then I got my desired results.p  pAt first, I thought that Android rounded my factor of 65 to 1 because I didnt declare it as a double, so what I tried next isp  precodedouble factor  65 codepre  pAnd then I used that in my equation. However, it seemed that I still was getting 1 and not 1.2 as my factor.p  pMy question is this Why does it seem that Android does not handle fraction operations well Usually I wouldnt have a problem since 65 conveniently converted to 1.2. However, in situations wherein the fraction does not convert nicely to a decimal, then wed have problems with accuracy. Are there ways to use fractions reliably when doing math operations in Androidp

Let me know if I need to expose implementation.p  precode    type        TDynamicRecord  record         Field1, Field2, Field3 string         DateSBU TDate         TimeSBU TTime       end        TDateCell  classTCalendarEdit       protected         procedure SetDataconst Value TValue override       public         constructor CreateAOwner TComponent override       end        TDateColumn  classTColumn       protected         function CreateCellControl TStyledControl override       public         constructor CreateAOwner TComponent override       end codepre  pThe code works fine and the column of type codeTDateColumncode can be added to the grid. p  pI asked a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq322585255043424questiona and opened a bounty for it looking for a technique to populate the user defined column by codeLiveBindingscode but I have got no answers by the bounty expiry date. That is why now I am trying another way. I declare a collection codeDynamicData TListltTDynamicRecordgtcode and populate it from the dataset. This approach is quite clearly explained in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma92682445043424answera of MikeSutton and in his blog. I have managed to do this. The data is displayed properly in the grid and in its newly defined columns.p  pBut now I am stuck with the other problem. I need to update dataset on user activities. I tried the codeOnSetValuecode and codeOnEditingDonecode events of the parent grid according to the documentation these event are to be used for data updates but strangely it does not fire.p  pWhat will be the proper event or other way suitable for updating the dataset p

Negative 77858 pI am running a streaming job and want to build a lookup map incrementally track unique items, filter duplicated incomings for example, initially I was thinking to keep one Dataframe in cache, and union it with new Dataframe created in each batch, something like this p  pitems.foreachRDDrdd RDD[String]         ...br         val uf   rdd.toDF          cacheddf  cacheddf.unionAlluf          cacheddf.cache          cacheddf.count    materialize the  ...       p  pMy concern is that the cacheddf seems remember all the lineages to previous RDDs appended from every batch iteration, in my case, if I dont care to recompute this cached RDD if it crashes, is that an overhead to maintain the growing DAG p  pAs an alternative, at the beginning of each batch, I load the lookup from parquet file, instead of keeping it in memory, then at the end of each batch I append the new RDD to the same parquet file  noDuplicatedDF.write.modeSaveMode.Append.parquetlookup. This works as expected, but is there straight forward way that keep the lookup in memory p  pThanks  Wanchun p
