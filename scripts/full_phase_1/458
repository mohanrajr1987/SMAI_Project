When I go back and search the book for codesignuppathcode, Table 5.1 indicates it is the named route for code[sampleapp url]signupcode which should direct visitors to the signup page of the website. Additionally, when I search the book for codeuserspathcode, Table 7.1 indicates that it is the named route for code[sampleapp url]userscode using the create controller action because we are issuing a codePOSTcode HTTP request.    p  pNOTE In responses, strongpleasestrong dont suggest altering this code.

Positive 458 h2Backgroundh2  pIm writing a lot of go code, using the codego testcode tool and the provided codetestingcode package for, well, testing. Most of the testing that I do is unit testing, within the TDD discipline. These units under test are never permitted to depend on stateful externalities like persistent storage, a network hop, etc., but receive fake, inmemory implementations of those externalities usually in constructorbuilder functions yes, I know they arent constructors in the traditional sense.p  h2The Problemh2  pIt has long bothered me that the codego testcode tool always runs test functions in the same deterministic order. This has, in a few cases, allowed race conditions to hide in the code. One way to find these bugs is by setting the coderacecode flag. Another might be to always run unit tests in parallel...p  h2The Questionh2  pIs there emeverem a situation in which emisolatedem unit tests could not or should not emalwaysem be run in parallel using the codeparallelcode flagp

Positive 458 ptldr Valid names dont get written to the database because the test fails, and invalid names do get written to the database because the test passes.p  pstrongEditstrong emFor clarification about the project and my question in general As described in the book, this User model is set up as the beginning stages to allow a website user to eventually log in to a website. The database columns would be name and email, and each row would be one user assuming the user name and email were valid. Ive edited my original post below for further clarification, and all edits are in italics.emp  pemAdditionally, please only respond if you can explain the code strongas isstrong in my postdont suggest adding additional code to make it work. The textbook Im working from asserts that this code should work as is, yet it seems to evaluate to the opposite that it should. Lastly, if you know other links that explain this in more detail, that is helpful however, I have already read a hrefhttpapidock.comrailsActiveSupportTestingAssertionsassertnot relnofollowapidocka, a hrefhttpapi.rubyonrails.orgclassesActiveSupportTestingAssertions.html relnofollowRoR APIa, and most of the SO links that show up in a Google search, and none have been helpful in explicating this problem.em p  pIm working through Michael Hartls Ruby on Rails Tutorial. Im in chapter 6 working through validation tests and Im stuck on the validation for the presence of a name. It seems to be doing exactly the opposite of what the tutorial says it should do i.e., validating a nonvalid name entry, even though Ive followed the tutorial exactly. Ive also searched the web and SO for more details on how codeassertnotcode works, but cant find any helpful details. Heres the process Ive went through.p  ol lipAdd a test that we know will fail p  precoderequire testhelper  class UserTest lt ActiveSupportTestCase    def setup     user  User.newname Example User, email userexample.com   end     resolves to true and passes   test should be valid do    assert user.valid   end    test name should be present do     user.name            assertnot user.valid   end  end codepreli ol  pSo far so good. I understand this code perfectly well, and although the second tests wording is awkward, I interpret codeassertnot user.validcode to work like this codeuser.validcode evaluates to true, since no validations have been set up, so the test thinks a name with all blank spaces is valid. This is preceded by an codeassertnotcode which converts a true value to false, and makes the test fail. p  ol start2 lipWe add a validation test p  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase   validates name, presence true end codepreli ol  pThis sets a validation rule for the User model that ensures the codenamecode object has content and is not nil, an empty string, or blank space. Still good so far. p  ol start3 lipHeres where things get tricky. At this point, the expression codeuser.validcode in our test should and does evaluate to false, since the validation rule wont allow a codenamecode with only spaces in it. Ive added comments alongside this code to help my mind see what values are assigned and evaluated in this process p  precodetest name should be present do     user.name           gt name     email exampleexample.com     assertnot user.valid       gt assertnot false gt true end codepreli ol  pcodeuser.validcode evaluates to false, which makes the entire codeassertnotcode expression evaluate to true, and thus the test passes. emIn pseudocode, this line could translate thusly codeassertnot is the user valid nocode  codeassertnotfalsecode  codetruecode. Similarly, We do not assert that the user is false, which evaluates to true.emp  pThis is where my problem is The test passes on an invalid value for codenamecode, thus allowing a name consisting of blank spaces to be written to the database, when thats exactly the opposite of what we are trying to achieve, namely, empreventingem blank names from being written to db. p  ol start4 lipConversely, I worked out this logic with a valid name p  precodetest name should be present do  gt name Example User email exampleexample.com     assertnot user.valid       assertnot true gt false end codepreli ol  pIn this case, since codeuser.validcode evaluates to true since Example User is a valid name, codeassertnot user.validcode evaluates to false, the test fails, and our valid name does not get written to the database. emIn pseudocode, this line could translate thusly codeassertnot is the user valid yescode  codeassertnottruecode  codefalsecode. Similarly, We do not assert that the user is true, which evaluates to false. Because the test evaluates to false even with a truevalid user name, this valid name is not written to the database.emp  pIf someone could explain how this makes any sense, Id greatly appreciate it, and detailed answers walking me through it would be even better. p

Negative 458 pIn my webapplication C, .Net 3.5, made up of a emcoreem class library containing the business logic, data layer and a couple of utility classes, a windows service project, a webservice project and the website project, I have a couple of static classes in the emcoreem library used by all other projects. These classes for example the strongLogstrong class require some initialization They have an strongInitializestrong method in order to set them up for usage. As an example, the strongInitializestrong method of the strongLogstrong class has a directory path parameter which tells the strongLogstrong, where to save the logfiles to. Alternativly I was thinking of loading the settings for the strongLogstrong class from a configuration file in the static constructor. The drawback is, that I need different settings for unittesting then in production code.p  pIs there a better way to design this The drawback of this approach is, that all consumers of the static class will attempt to call Initialize. This is not really a problem because once initialized, the method will return immediately instead of executing the Initialize code again, but the design seems a bit weird to me. p  pI hope my english is sufficient to explain what Im after. Do not hesitate to ask if the question is not clear enough.p
Negative 458 pI have a large existing c codebase.  Typically the users of the codebase edit the source with gvim, but wed like to start using the nifty IDE features in Eclipse.  The codebase has an extensive directory hierarchy, but the source files use include directives without paths due to some voodoo we use in our build process.  When I link the source to my project in Eclipse, the indexer complains that it cant find any header files because we dont specify paths in our includes.  If I manually add the directories from the workspace to the include path then everything works wonderfully, but obviously adding hundreds of directories manually isnt feasible.  Would there be a simple method to tell Eclipse to look anywhere in the project for the include files without having to add them one by one  If not, then can anyone suggest a good starting place, like what classes to extend, for writing a plugin to just scan the project at creationmodification and programatically add all directories to the include pathp

Negative 458 pThis might seem like a noddy question, but I was looking at this because I heard someone claiming that you must call Close on a FileStream, even if it is in a using block and they have code where Close is being called right at the end of the block.p  pI know that Close is meant to call Dispose, but I thought Id look deeper since this is .Net 1.1 code, and the bulk of my experience has been with 2.0 on.p  pOne thing that struck me was that the MSDN documentation for FileStream has Dispose and Disposebool for .Net 2.0 on, but only Disposebool for .Net 1.1.p  pI thought that might be an oversight, so I used Reflector to look into an assembly  and there too, I see Disposebool, but no Dispose.p  pIs this correct If so, whats the story here FileStream works in a using block  which I thought meant it must implement IDisposable which, to my knowledge only declares Dispose.p  pIs there some compiler magic going on, or am I missing a hidden implementation of Dispose somewhere which, presumably, calls Disposetrue or Disposefalse  p  pFinally no pun intended, can you confirm that scoping a FileStream in using block will close stream at scope exit in .Net 1.1p  p[edit]p  pJust to clarify, this is C code. I understand that VB.Net didnt get the using statement until .Net 2.0, but my understanding is that C had it in 1.1 and my 1.1 code here has it in and it compilesp

Negative 458 pI wrote an application which allows people to contribute plugins to extend the functionality. Such plugins are deployed as DLL files, which the framework picks up during runtime. Each plugin features a factory function which is called multiple times during the lifetime of the application to create objects. So far, in order to handle the ownership issue with these objects, I used a simple counting shared pointer on the returned objects so that they are destroyed whenever the last reference is removed.p  pHowever, this tends to trigger crashes on Windows since its not unlikely to happen that the object is newed in the plugin DLL but later due to a deref call on the shared pointer deleted in the main application  and AFAIK this mallocfree mixup is a nono on Windows.p  pMy current solution to this is to let deref not call delete this directly but rather a release function which must be implemented by the plugins and calls delete this. However, its quite annoying that each and every plugin has to implement this trivial function  I worked around this so far by providing a convenience macro plugin authors have to use. Does anybody have alternative ideas maybep  pSo far, my approach is that all objects contributed by plugins is allocated in the plugins and also released there  of course, an alternative might be to let all memory be allocated in the main application by providing a pointer to a malloclike function to the plugins which they can then call as needed and released there as well. The issue with this is that its not as convenient for the plugin authors, I think.p  pId be interested in any other perspectives on this issue.p  pemUPDATEem I just realized that I could reimplement operator new and operator delete on the baseclass of the objects returned by the plugins, so that newing them and deleteing them will always result in function calls into the same module so that either all allocations and frees are done in the plugin, or in the framework.p

So I have built in contingency to be able to catch a unique key constraint each job has an id, which is the primary key in the database.  I have this value hard coded to 1 so that only one entry can be in database.  I am using Springs JdbcTemplatep  precode try        this.jobJdbcTemplate.updateinsert into JOB JOBID, RUNNING values 1,Y    catch DataAccessException dae      if StringUtils.containsdae.getMessage, ORA00001             throw new JobRunningExceptionJob is already running               throw new JobExceptionError setting Job Flag.     codepre  pSo again, this function correctly but I can imagine there is a better way to do this.  Can you please suggest another approach  It seems to me that I need something which will lock the database while I check if flag is running and then set flag running.  Remember, there are 2 databases, so I dont know if having the lock on just one will work.  Should I be looking at Springs tranactions  Or can you suggest something elsep  pThanks.p

Negative 458 pIm using Visual Studio 2008 SP1 for C. When compiling, Visual Studio needs to choose against which version of the CRT and MFC DLLs the application should be linked, version 9.0.21022.8  RTM, 9.0.30729.17  SP1 or 9.0.30729.4148  SP1 with security update. Id like to know how you can choose which of both versions will be linked against. Does anyone knowp  pbNoteb this is important when using a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa37567428VS.8529.aspx relnofollowprivate assemblya, because you need to know which versions of the VC 9.0 DLLs to copy along with the .exe.p  pbNoteb that the BINDTOCURRENTVCLIBSVERSION flag only makes sure that the right version is included in the manifest. The DLL version selection at runtime is apparently not done based upon the version that is included in the manifest file. Even if the manifest file says that v21022 should be used, the .exe uses the v30729 .DLLs. I know this, because it uses stdtr1weakptr, which is not present in v21022.p

Negative 458 pIm building a system for updating large amounts of data through various CSV feeds. Normally I would just loop though each row in the feed, do a select query to check if the item already exists and insertupdate an item depending if it exists or not. p  pI feel this method isnt very scalable and could hammer the server on larger feeds. My solution is to loop through the items as normal but store them in memory. Then for every 100 or so items do a select on those 100 items and get a list of existing items in the database that match. Then concatenate the insertupdate statements together and run them into the database. This would essentially cut down on the trips to the database. p  pIs this a scalable enough solution and are there any example tutorials on importing large feeds into a productive environmentp  pThanksp

Negative 458 pI feel like the answer to this question is really simple, but I really am having trouble finding it. So here goesp  pSuppose you have the following classesp  precodeclass Base class Child  public Base  class Displayer  public     DisplayerBase element     DisplayerChild element  codepre  pAdditionally, I have a codeBase objectcode which might point to either an instance of the class codeBasecode or an instance of the class codeChildcode.p  pNow I want to create a codeDisplayercode based on the element pointed to by codeobjectcode, however, I want to pick the right version of the constructor. As I currently have it, this would accomplish just that I am being a bit fuzzy with my C here, but I think this the clearest wayp  precodeobjectgtcreateDisplayer  virtual void BasecreateDisplayer       new Displayerthis   virtual void ChildcreateDisplayer       new Displayerthis  codepre  pThis works, however, there is a problem with thisp  pcodeBasecode and codeChildcode are part of the application system, while codeDisplayercode is part of the GUI system. I want to build the GUI system independently of the Application system, so that it is easy to replace the GUI. This means that codeBasecode and codeChildcode should not know about codeDisplayercode. However, I do not know how I can achieve this without letting the Application classes know about the GUI.p  pAm I missing something very obvious or am I trying something that is not possiblep  pEdit I missed a part of the problem in my original question. This is all happening quite deep in the GUI code, providing functionality that is unique to this one GUI. This means that I want the codeBasecode and codeChildcode classes not to know about the call at all  not just hide from them to what the call isp

Negative 458 pI am looking for a way to query for products in a catalog using filters on properties which have been assigned to the product based on the category to which the product belongs. So I have the following entities involvedp  pstrongProductsstrong  Id  CategoryIdp  pstrongCategoriesstrong  [Id, Name, UrlName]p  pstrongPropertiesstrong  [Id, CategoryId, Name, UrlName]p  pstrongPropertyValuesstrong  [Id, PropertyId, Text, UrlText]p  pstrongProductPropertyValuesstrong  [ProductId, PropertyValueId]p  pWhen I add a product to the catalog, multiple ProductPropertyValues will be added based on the category and I would like to be able to filter all products from a category by selecting values for one or more properties. The business logic and SQL indexes and constraints make sure that all UrlNames and texts are unique for values properties and categories.p  pThe solution will be a MVC3 EF code first based application and the routing is setup as followedp  precodeproductscategoryUrlNamefilters codepre  pThe filter routing part has a variable length so multiple filters can be applied. Each filter contains the UrlName of the property and the UrlText of the value separated by an underscore.p  pAn url could look like this productswebsitesframeworkmvc3languagecsharpp  pI will gather all filters, which I will hold in a list, by reading the URL. Now it is time to actually get the products based on multiple properties and I have been trying to find the right strategy.p  pMaybe there is another way to implement the filters. All larger web shops use category depending filters and I am still looking for the best way to implement the persistence part for this type of functionality. The suggested solutions result in an or resultset if multiple filters are selected. I can imagine that adding a text property to the product table in which all property values are stores as a joined string can work as well. I have no idea what this would cost performance wise. At leased there will be no complex join and the properties and their values will be received as text anyway.p  pMaybe the filtering mechanism can be done client side ass well.p

Negative 458 pIve written a huge page in JavaScript for a tournament Im hosting on a game. Ive gotten everything I really need worked out into arrays, but I want to add rounds. The whole script adjusts to tournament settings for more in the future and Id like this to adjust itself as well. So, lets say the tournament settings are [game,teamsize,entrylimit]. The entrylimit will be the key to finding the solution, because that decides the rounds. It works in a tree system or however its called. Lets say the entrylimit is 8. That means the first round will consist of 4 matches, and the second will consist of 2. If the entrylimit were 16, then the first round would consist of 8 matches, the second would consist of 4, and the third would consist of 2. I want to find a way to stick this into my loop where matches are written, and use the entrylimit and match number to generate the round number. All I need is a formula that can use those two variables to get my desired result. Also I apologize for the excessive amount of detail.p

This link will be used thousands of times, in many different views. I want to centralize this method so that, when I need to make a change, I can make it once.p  pHowever, this practice absolutely violates the MVC architecture. Others suggest using a helperp  precodemodule UsersHelper   def profilelinkuser, args     linkto user.name, usersprofilepathuser, args   end end codepre  pNow, I have to wrap the user in the method instead of calling it as a method ON userp  precodelt profilelinkuser gt codepre  pWhich, in my opinion, is uglier than the latter example.p  pSo my question is  which is better Or is there a way to accomplish this that Im completely unaware ofp

Negative 458 pI am using Win 7 and I use Resource monitor to see the memory usages.What is the difference between Commit and Working set in resource monitor.p
Negative 458 pThis is currently what I have.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comT0Uh0.png althttpi2.photobucket.comalbumsy2LokololinearLayout.pngp  pAll the boxes are linear layouts. But I want the Star to be right aligned. I have added a TextView with     just to make a little space but I will be removing this. If I change the TextView to fillparent it causes the Star to go off to the right of the screen as expected but I was hoping it would fill up everything inbetween itself and the starp  pI cant think how to make the ImageView go to the right. The layoutgrvaity is currently right but this hasnt changed anything. p  pNot very good with design p  pTIAp
Negative 458 pI have a page that contains a PrimeFaces accordion panel, in each panel is a PrimeFaces datatable. Below the datatable is a button Add study for example and when this button is click I want to dynamically load a page into a codelthpanelGroupgtcode using a codeltuiincludegtcode. When the button is being click I want to dynamically change the src value from the codeltuiincludegtcode so that my page is loaded in the codelthpanelGroupgtcode. Now the problem is the followingp  pMy managed bean is set to codeRequestScopedcode and when I click on my button nothing is being rendered.  If I set my managed bean to codeSessionScopedcode the codelthpanelGroupgtcode is filled after the second click on the button, the first click doesnt do anything.p  pUsed technologies  JSF2.0,

Negative 458 pI am writing a network kernel extension for socket filtering. To make it configurable, a userland program reads a config file and passes the information to the kext through a codePFSYSTEMcode socket.p  pIf I want to have the socket filter up and running as soon as possible at system startup, how would I choreograph the launchp  pMy current idea is to use launchd to start a small userland initializer program. This program would use codekextloadcode to start the kext. After that, it would read the config file and talk to the kext through the codePFSYSTEMcode socket. Having done its job, it would then quickly exit.p  pAnother option would be to have two codelaunchdcode items, one for the kext using codekextloadcode and another for the userland configuration file reader. This would avoid the fork, but would otherwise be identical. Either way, codelaunchdcode would have to run a quick nondaemon userland program.p  pHowever, codelaunchdcode seems to be geared towards launching actual daemons, not for quick tasks that do their work and exit. The a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationMacOSXConceptualBPSystemStartupArticlesLaunchOnDemandDaemons.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40001762104142 relnofollowdeveloper library documenta saysp  blockquote   pstrongImportantstrong If your daemon shuts down too quickly after being launched, launchd may think it has crashed. Daemons that continue this behavior may be suspended and not launched again when future requests arrive. To avoid this behavior, do not shut down for at least 10 seconds after launch. p blockquote  pThis gives me the impression that codelaunchdcode is not the correct way to do this. How should I organize the launch Is my whole idea going in the wrong directionp  pAs a side note, I want to give the user the possibility to alter the filtering options during runtime too. I imagine this can be done simply by opening a new PFSYSTEM socket connection to the kext whenever changes are needed.p

Negative 458 pSeveral days ago my Google Chrome was updated to 12.0.742.53 beta, and Ive noticed very interesting change.br When opening a Youtube video page, page loading process does not end even when all the content text, images is loaded loading ends only when strongvideo bufferingstrong completes Also, when I interrupt the loading by pressing codeEsccode, for example video downloading is also stopped Until now I had to right click on the video and press emStop Downloadem to abort buffering. p  pIMHO thats a great user experience and a big step for making the Flashbased content behave like ordinary web content.p  pMy question is how this is done   p  pI thought theyre simulating some loading process until the buffering completes. Also they should have handled the codewindow.onAbortcode event or something, in order to tell the Flash to stop buffering. I tried to catch that event using Chromes DOM Inspector, but no luck...   p  pOr... do they use some special API that is currently available only in Chrome There is no such behavior on FF4 right now.p

Negative 458 pIm developing an app which I want to make available both for Android and Blackberry possibly to JavaME in the future. The business logic will be common to all the platforms  and hence, so will the corresponding layer in code.p  pBut I also have a data layer  which will obviously be different to the various platforms. My approach to this is to have a bean and an abstract DataStore class. If I were using Androids NotePad sample, it would look like thisp  pemstrongNote Beanemstrongp  precodepublic class Note      private long id     private String title     private String note     private long created     private long modified      Appropriate constructors     Getters and Setters  codepre  pemstrongDataStore Interfaceemstrongp  precodepublic interface NoteDataStore      public boolean deleteNotelong noteId     public boolean addNoteNote note     public ListltNotegt listNotes     public boolean editNotelong noteId, Note note     public ListltNotegt searchString searchString  codepre  pEvery platform would implement the datastore interface and perform the persistent data access as appropriate. The Android implementation, for example, would use SQLite classes for this purpose.p  pThis way, the higher level layers would be common between all the platforms  as long as they do not use any platformspecific features.p  pemstrongQuestionemstrongp  pDoesnt the functionality of the DataStore above partially overlap with that of the codeContentProvidercode in Android I thought of various approaches to make this cleaner but Im not convinced with any of themp  ul lipHave my codeContentProvidercode also implement the DataStore interface.  But, doesnt this clutter the ContentProvider, not to mention mix up the responsibilitiespli lipImplement SQLite access in the codeContentProvidercode  and then have the DataStore implementation call the ContentProvider under the covers.  But, what about the overhead of an additional layer Plus, I would still need to use the ContentProvider directly, for example to use the Android Search Framework. Isnt that like duplicating the same functionality in multiple layerspli lipInverse of the above approach  i.e, implement the SQLite in the DataStore layer and then have the codeContentProvidercode call to it under the covers. I cannot think of how this is any different from the previous approach.pli ul  pBottom line is  if it wasnt for codeContentProvidercode  just the DataStore layer would work fine and this design would make the business logic reusable across platforms. The only reason I cannot entirely discard the ContentProviders is certain components of the Android system expect you to expose data as a ContentProvider Search, for example.p  pI would appreciate any tips on how you have handled this in your apps.

For scrolling foreground I simply use CCFollow action for my CCLayer, where all objects are placed. Now Im confused, what is the best way to implement my first and second layers. Does cocos2d have any actions, similar to CCFollow, but having custom speed speed is not best word to use, but its difficult to find appropriate term for me My background and semibackground images are tiled textures.p

Negative 458 pI have condition where the way i construct a string finalValue is based on the number of non null values i get in my input.

Negative 458 pIs it possible to optimize a series of glued together codestdfunctioncodes andor is there any implementation that attempts to do thisp  pWhat I mean is most easily expressed mathematically say I want to make a codestdfunctioncode that is a function of a functionp  precodefx,y,z  x2  y3  z4 gx,y,z  fx,y,z  xy2 codepre  pIs there a way for an STLcompiler implementor to optimize away parts of the arithmetic is calling a function object of codegcode, created from a function object of codefcodep  pThis would be a kind of symbolic simplification of the functions, but because this is a codestdfunctioncode, it would have to be spotted on a machine level.p  pDue to this being an optimization, which takes time, and probably isnt free in clock cycles andor memory, it probably isnt allowed by the Standard It leans very close to a language that is typically ran through a VM. Im thinking LLVM more than Java here, with runtime optimizations.p  pEDIT In order to make the discussion more useful, heres a short code snippet I understand a lambda is not a codestdfunctioncode, but a lambda can be stored in a codestdfunctioncode, so assuming codeautocode below means codestdfunctionltTgtcode with the appropriate codeTcode will express perfectly what I meant abovep  precodeauto f  []const double x, const double y, const double z return xxyyyzzzz  auto g  []const double c, const double y, const double z return fx,y,zxyy  codepre  pA trivial compiler would make codegcode equivalent to p  precodedouble gconst double x, const double y, const double z return xxyyyzzzzxyy  codepre  pWhile an optimized codestdfunctioncode could make it mathematically and in every other sense correctp  precodedouble g const double x, const double y, const double z return xyzzzz  codepre  pNote that although Im talking about mathematical functions here, similar transformations could be made for functions in the general sense, but that would take more introspection, which means overhead.p  pI can see this being very important when designing mathematical and physics simulations, where the generality of compositing existing library functions into usercase functions, with all the usual mathematical simplifications could make for a nice method of expressive, yet performant calculation software.p

Negative 458 pI needed to calculate exponents using GWT 2.3 in Java. ie xy. Theres no native power operator in Java, normally you have to import java.lang.Math to use the pow method. But you cannot do that in GWT client side I think. p  pI did temporarily solve the problem by creating my own pow method. But Id guess what I wrote is probably inefficient and not as good as a native solution. p  precodeprivate long powint b, int e      long result  1     for int i  0 i lt e i          result  b          return result  codepre  pSo I googled for a better solution than mine and found a few people using third party libraries such as com.googlecode.gwt.math.Math.

But I couldnt find any help on how to use these integrated math libraries in 2.3.p  pWhat exactly do I need to import And how exactly do I use these libraries Where exactly can I find official GWT documentation on these Are they really integrated Or should I just keep using my own method abovep

Negative 458 pI have a test module in the standard unittest formatp  precodeclass mytestunittest.TestCase      def test1self         [tests]      def test2self         [tests]   etc.... codepre  pMy company has a proprietary test harness that will execute my module as a command line script, and which will catch any errors raised by my module, but requires that my module be mute if successful.p  pSo, I am trying to find a way to run my test module naked, so that if all my tests pass then nothing is printed to the screen, and if a test fails with an AssertionError, that error gets piped through the standard Python error stack just like any other error would in a normal Python script.p  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryunittest.html relnofollowdocsa advocate using the unittest.main function to run all the tests in a given module likep  precodeif name  main     unittest.main codepre  pThe problem is that this wraps the test results in unittests harness, so that even if all tests are successful, it still prints some fluff to the screen, and if there is an error, its not simply dumped as a usual python error, but also dressed in the harness.p  pIve tried redirecting the output to an alternate stream usingp  precodewith open.LOG,a as logf     suite  unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromTestCasemytest     unittest.TextTestRunnerstream  logf.runsuite codepre  pThe problem here is that EVERYTHING gets piped to the log file including all notice of errors. So when my companies harness runs the module, it completes successfully because, as far as it can tell, no errors were raised because they were all piped to the log file.p  pAny suggestions on how I can construct a test runner that suppresses all the fluff, and pipes errors through the normal Python error stack As always, if you think there is a better way to approach this problem, please let me know.p  pEDITp  pHere is what I ended up using to resolve this. First, I added a gettestnames method to my test classp  precodeclass mytestunittest.TestCase   etc....     staticmethod     def gettestnames         Return the names of all the test methods for this class.         testnames  [ member[0] for memeber in inspect.getmembersmytest                        if test in member[0] ] codepre  pThen I replaced my call to codeunittest.maincode with the followingp  precode Unittest catches all errors raised by the test cases, and returns them as   formatted strings inside a TestResult object. In order for the test   harness to catch these errors they need to be reraised, and so I am defining   this CompareError class to do that.   For each code error, a CompareError will be raised, with the original error   stack as the argument. For test failures i.e. assertion errors an   AssertionError is raised. class CompareErrorException     def initself,err         self.err  err     def strself         return reprself.err   Collect all tests into a TestSuite alltests  ut.TestSuite for test in mytest.gettestnames     alltests.addTestmytesttest  Define a TestResult object and run tests results  ut.TestResult alltests.runresults  Reraise any script errors for error in results.errors     raise CompareErrorerror[1]  Reraise any test failures  for failure in results.failures     raise AssertionErrorfailure[1] codepre

In my case, every work group accesses different addresses in the global memory, so in other words, I use the global memory as a kind of local memory.p  pSo what I ask myself is now, if the device knows that I dont read data written by another work group  item, can memory access be speeded up What exactly does codeconstantcode effect in terms of memory access mechanism Could I misuse this or a similar keyword Or is there even a keyword  method for my problem I overlookedp  pAnother thing is The memory for this data structure only has to be allocated in the devices memory I do not need to access not even initialize it in the host. Is there a more efficient way to do this than send an uninitialized array to the device I use QtOpenCL which lets me pass a hostinitialized vector of primitives which is converted hostinternally to a buffer and sent to the device on kernel invocation. So Im looking for a QtOpenCLway to do this. AFAIK, only local memory can be allocated from within kernel. I get errors when defining an array as codeglobalcode.p  pThanks in advancep

Additionally, the error isnt being reported in the validation summary but the validator fires and changes the color of the textbox to red.p

Negative 458 pIm aware that this question has been asked here before, but I didnt find satisfactory answers. Im working on a website which obtains its content from a Facebook profile, so that, basically, each content item corresponds to a resource album, post, image, etc. from that profile. Id like each subpage to contain the Comments plugin displaying relevant comments from the profile. I have most of it sorted out, except for links to individual resources. So far Ive only been able to obtain an empty comment box. I tried various combinations of IDs, tried Open Graph interface, but none of it worked. I read that Comments is meant to work only with stuff outside Facebook, but it sounds improbable. Ill appreciate any info or hint regarding this problem and meanwhile will do some more googling.

Negative 458 pWe have a .NET application that transfers files from a client workstation to a database on a central server in a LAN. A few of our customers run this on wireless Windows XP workstations that use a commercial, 3rdparty WiFi encryption mechanism for various reasons they dont use standard WiFi encryption such as WPA. Fairly consistently, these workstations bluescreen when our application runs.p  pOur application does not directly call any unmanaged code, but apparently something our program is doing is indirectly causing a problem in the underlying network stack. I got a mini kernel dump file from one of the affected machines and loaded it in WinDbg, and it told me that the crash was probably caused by the .sys file which is one of the driver files for the encryption software which I already suspected. However, the debugger didnt tell me much else that was helpful.p  pMy question is this strongis there any way for me to get a stack trace from the point of the crash all the way up to our .NET applicationstrong Do I need a complete memory dump I have the source for our application, but I am hindered by the fact that a I dont have the source or symbols for the driver in question and b I am not experienced with lowlevel Windows debugging. I dont mind modifying our application if necessary to avoid the problematic calls if necessary, but Id need to know what calls to avoid.p

Negative 458 pWhile a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8996002utf8supportsqlserver2012andtheutf8stringudtresearching optionsa for storing mostlyEnglishbutsometimesnot data in a SQL Server database that can potentially be quite large, Im leaning toward storing most string data as UTF8 encoded.p  pHowever, Microsoft chose UCS2 for reasons that I dont fully understand which is causing me to secondguess that leaning.  The documentation for SQL Server 2012 does show how to create a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff87796428vsql.11029.aspx relnofollowUTF8 UDTa, but the decision for UCS2 presumably pervades SQL Server.p  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUnicode relnofollowWikipediaa which interestingly notes that UCS2 is obsolete in favor of UTF16 notes that UTF8 is a variablewidth character set capable of encoding any Unicode data point and that it codeprovides the de facto standard encoding for interchange of Unicode textcode.  So, it feels like any Unicode character can be represented in UTF8, and since most text will be English, the representation will be nearly twice as compact as with UCS2 I know disk is cheap, but disk cache isnt, and memory isnt in comparison to the data sizes Im dealing with.  Many operations degrade exponentially when the working set is larger than available RAM.p  pWhat problems might I encounter by swimming up the UCS2 streamp

Negative 458 pIm working on a Flash game that must be FlashPlayer 10 compatible no stage3D therefore. There are several movieclips that are transformed in 3D and they also contain child movieclips which may have different 3D transformations applied to them. now, some of the innter movieclips shall contain prerendered animations. Right now i imported them as embedded videos. however, this causes the performance to drop significantly, making the game unplayable.p  pCan anyone give me performance optimization tips on how to have animations playing on 3D transformed layersp  pThanksp  pedit answer to first commentp  pthe stage contains one child representing the 3D scene this movieClip is moved in Z direction to make the camera move through the scene. this sceneClip contains one big clip rotated 90 degree arround X 3D to represent the floor as well as aproximately 20 clips facing the camera and lying on different Z depths. Each of these 20 child clips contains 18 animated children. An animated child clip consists of a prerendered animation of aproximately 20 frames in resolution 150x150. In total there are about 2030 such animated clips.p  pi know that flash caches some movieClips together with their children as bitmaps when the clip is 3D transformed. maybe updating these caches when the animations play is causing the performance drop. maybe restructuring the nesting could solve the problemp

The view is in the parent RelativeLayout. Its a touchable menu of icons, and is animated with an xml resource on a click to slide off screen leaving just a little tab showing, where it needs to stay until clicked again.p  precodepublic void RetractTools View v           final ImageView finalImage1  ImageView findViewByIdR.id.paintsView     Animation slideout  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationthis, R.anim.slideouttools     slideout.setFillAftertrue     slideout.setAnimationListenernew AnimationListener          Override         public void onAnimationEndAnimation animation              finalImage1.setEnabledtrue             optionMenu.showing  false             optionMenu.inMotion  false             finalImage1.layout1258, 668, 1697, 752             finalImage1.setRight1280             finalImage1.invalidate                   Override         public void onAnimationRepeatAnimation arg0                    Override         public void onAnimationStartAnimation arg0              finalImage1.setEnabledfalse                    optionMenu.inMotion  true     v.startAnimationslideout   End RetractMenu codepre  pNo matter what I try, I encounter problems. setFillAfter does nothing when set in the xml file. Set programmatically, it leaves the image in the right place but the touch controls remain where the menu was. I have tried setLeft and setRight which apparently only move the image, not the view position, and all sorts of different layout options, and fill and no fill and invalidating and not, but cant solve it. I clearly dont undersatnd the underlying mechanics needed to position and render a view Dp  pThanks.p  pemstrongEDIT  Solutionemstrongp  pFor anyone having similar issues, this is how I have found to work with relative layouts. You create a LayoutParams object with the specified size, and then you can assign it positions. eg. p  precode    final RelativeLayout.LayoutParams position  new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsRelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT                position.leftMargin  440 codepre  pThen assign that to your view p  precode    myView.setLayoutParamsposition codepre  pSo in summary, you use a LayoutParams object as an interface to your views position, rather than accessing the views coordinates directly as I assumed. p

Negative 458 pI recently a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1eninnodbautoincrementhandling.html relnofollowreada that because of how InnoDB recalculates the codeAUTOINCREMENTcode value when the server restarts, any records on the high end of the ID list may have their IDs reused.p  pNormally, this isnt a problem, because when a user is deleted everything associated with the ID is deleted from other tables too.p  pBut Im deliberately leaving their forum posts orphaned, labelled as Posted by emUser 123em, so that past conversations are retained. Clearly, should an ID be reused, this will be a problem.p  pIve never had this issue before because there were always enough new users to make it unlikely for an ID to be reused in this way. However on my new project signups are rare and inactive user deletions frequent especially since the Open Alpha accounts only last for three days as a preview, and such ID reuse has happened three for three now.p  pI have fixed the issue by saving the correct value for codeAUTOINCREMENTcode elsewhere and using that instead of relying on the internal value. Is there an actual way to have InnoDB remember the actual last valuep

String.intern seems like a nobrainer in this case, but Im worried about the synchronization overhead of calling intern everytime I store a currency somewhere.p  pOn top of that, some other types of strings can have millions of different values, but still have tens of thousands of copies of each such as ISIN codes.

Negative 458 pHello people and bots,p  pIm developing the frontend web application for a system and have hit a little problem.p  pThe whole application has to be on one page, meaning no refreshes or page changes during the flow of the major areas of the application.p  pIt also has to work in all web browsers including IE7 and be deployable as a HTML5 application for tablets and mobile phones.p  pIts based around a user logging in, which is regulated by webforms authentication, then I need to poll or longpoll the server for updates. This would be simple if I could do a request for each part of the system, however if the system gets too big session blocking becomes a problem and it could also end up ddosing itself. So what I need to do is think of a way to send one request and build one response from that request.p  pMy first idea was to build a response model with JSON or XML and let JavaScript regulate what needs to be updated. For example, a new comment has been made on a topic, all the clients see this update near instantly. My idea was to send something like thisp  precode[     d              addComment  [topicIdtopic1, descriptionhaha, topicIdtopic1, descriptionlol],         addTopics  [topic2,topic708],      ] codepre  pJavaScript would then parse this and add haha, and lol to the element with the id topic1. In theory it seems quite simple to achieve, but as the system is getting bigger it seems to constantly be turning into a big mess.p  pMy second idea was to simply have a set of clientside functions for adding and removing stuff in the DOM, And then use a JSONP technique to call this function.p  precodevar addComment  functioncommentModel      var topic  document.getElementByIdcommentModel.topicId,         comments  topic.getElementByClassNamecomments[0],         comment  document.createElementdiv      comment.innerHTML  commentModel.description     comments.appendChildcomment      updateUnreadComments  codepre  pResponsep  precodefunctionaddComment     addComment topicId  topic1, description  haha      addComment topicId  topic1, description  lol  addComment codepre  pPersonally I find both methods a rather annoying workaround for nothing more than simple broadcasting.p  pI was wondering if anyone else has ever had the same problems and if they have ever come up with a more creative solution.p  pI would also like to know what kind of security issues I could expect with JSONP.p  pAll help is appreciatedp

Negative 458 pI am trying to use Karaf and I was wondering if it is possible to configure it to pull the transitive dependencies from the Apache Maven Central repository.  Without having to use embedded bundlesp  pI already know you can pull explicit dependencies, the key part of the the question is the transitive ones.p  pI also know you can use OBR to read from a repository.xml file in a deployed site, but I cant find one for Maven central.  A possible answer to the question would be to add the URL, but I cant find it documented anywhere what the repository.xml URL is.p  pAt the moment, my work around is to figure out what the dependencies are and explicitly add them to the p  pEmbedded bundles do not work with the Karaf OSGi blueprint implementation it just waits for something that wont exist.  I also find it ugly to have to do that.  Another possible answer I can think of for this question is if there were instructions to create a package that can be deployed to emanyem OSGi container not just Karaf using KAR files that contains all the necessary dependencies.p

Negative 458 pI have a complex view model which is a couple hundred lines of javascript code with a good amount of observable properties, computed observable properties, writable computed observable properties and functions.  So managing this is quite a bit of a challenge.p  pAn annoying problem that Ive had to deal with is that computed observables are calculated immediately right when you define it.  So using variables that havent been defined yet in the view model at the point of defining the observable lead to errors stating that the variable hasnt been defined.  It is... just later in the file.p  pHeres a contrived examplep  precodefunction ViewModel1args      var self  this      self.firstName  ko.observableargs.firstName     self.lastName  ko.observableargs.lastName     self.fullName  ko.computedfunction           return self.firstName     self.lastName        function ViewModel2args      var self  this      self.fullName  ko.computedfunction            uh oh, wheres firstName         return self.firstName     self.lastName          self.firstName  ko.observableargs.firstName     self.lastName  ko.observableargs.lastName  codepre  pUsing codeViewModel1code will work with no problems.  At the point codefullNamecode is defined, codefirstNamecode and codelastNamecode is defined so it works as expected.  Using codeViewModel2code will not work.  There would be an Error in the computed function stating codefirstNamecode is not defined.p  pWhat Ive been doing until now was to ensure that all computed observables are defined after all dependent variables have been defined.  The problem with this is that in doing so, things are defined in seemingly random places when I would rather keep related variables defined close together.p  pOne nice solution that Ive come up with is to define an initializing observable set to codetruecode and make all computed observables test if its still initializing and calculate and return the value when it isnt.  That way, the attempts to access the currently undefined variable will not be made.p  precodefunction ViewModel3args      var self  this     var initializing  ko.observabletrue      self.fullName  ko.computedfunction           if initializing              return self.firstName     self.lastName                   self.firstName  ko.observableargs.firstName     self.lastName  ko.observableargs.lastName      initializingfalse  codepre  pBut this wont be very practical in my case however.  I have many computed observables, so doing this in all of them will make it very bloated, remember I have a lot of these.  Throttling it doesnt seem to make a difference.p  pstrongIs there a way to tell knockout to wait before trying to calculate the values of computed observables  Or is there a better way for me to structure my code to deal with thisstrongp  pI could probably make some helper functions to manage the initialization logic, but Id still have to alter all of the computed observable definitions.  I suppose I can monkey patch knockout to add this initializing logic as Im not aware knockout has such options which I might just do.  Ive looked at the source for computed observables before but I dont know if theres already a setting elsewhere.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netS29c81jsfiddle demoap

Negative 458 pI have set up Amazon SES. My domain is verified and my DKIM is enabled and verified. Emails do send but I have a Bluehost account that does not receive the emails. According to the logs at Bluehost they dont hit their servers at all which implies there is no spam filter in the way. Has anyone run into this All other emails that I have tested have no issues. It appears to be unique to Bluehost but they tell me it cannot be them as it isnt even in their logs.p  pIs there a way to see the Amazon SES logs so I know where these emails get stopped.

Negative 458 pLets say I have 2 points  A and B. Between them and 0,0 forms an angle, I want to move point A so that point B moves too preserving the angle between them. p  pRight now I convert the vector offset into radians, add the angle I need and convert back to normal vector which I then use to place B in the right place. I was wondering though, if I can optimize this process by avoiding the jump to angles and back Since sine functions are computationally expensive on a CPU this could provide a great speedup.p

Negative 458 peveryone.  Im writing a fairly simple page, with a GridView that gets data from an SQLDataSource, which Ive done before.  When the page loads, it does an initial search which displays information suited to the person accessing the page.  That works fine.  I can vary the search terms and issue the modified query, and that works.  However, when I click on the Edit button, the Gridview vanishes and the EmptyDataText appears.  If i hit the button to resubmit the search, the Gridview reappears in edit mode.  I can modify fields and hit the Update button, and get EmptyDataText again. Resubmitting the search, the Gridview reappears, with the changed fields updated to the new values.p  pI can catch the OnRowEditing event, which shows that the button works.  I can catch the RowDatabound event that immediately follows  the Gridview is still visible, and I assume that its processing the header row.  On hitting Continue, I get EmptyDataText and do not see a RowDataBound event again.  My hypothesis is that it goes looking for the data in the first data row, and doesnt find any, hence the text display.p  pWhen I resubmit the search, I again see RowDataBound events, and on the event corresponding to the row with the clicked Edit button, I watch the preprocessing of the Edit mode display  this includes copying an ItemList from a searchcriteria DropDownList to an EditTemplate DropDownList. On the n  st Step Into, the GridView displays, with the correct row in Edit mode.p  pA similar pattern holds when I hit either Update or Cancel.  It looks like the GridView is losing its link to data when any of the Command buttons are hit, and requires a resubmission of the search to reestablish the link.  I have tried to rebind the grid at all points that I can think of either resetting the DataSourceID string, or that and issuing a DataBind call at PageLoad, and at various event handlers.  However, Ive done this sort of linking and editing in the past without having to be quite so draconian.

Negative 458 pstrongObjectivesstrongbr I need to implement file storage and processing back end for a web application. The application has these characteristicsbr br 1 Clients will store files of various formats and sizes could be in gigabyte rangebr  2 Sometimes clients will need to retrieve the file itselfbr 3 Sometimes clients will need to retrieve output data OD here onwards, where processing is performed on a previouslystored file to generate the OD. Important note the OD size is typically a emvery smallem fraction of the original file sizea 2GB file may produce a 1MB OD.br 4 Sometimes clients will apply transformations to the file e.g. file patching. br br strongConsidering a solutionstrongbr I could use a storage cluster e.g. SAN to achieve 1 and 2, and then a compute cluster for 3 and 4. But to shuttle lots of data between the SAN and compute cluster imagine 100s of users requesting ODs or patching files doesnt seem right to me, especially because the file data can be huge and most of the time clients only need small ODs or nothing patching operation consumes client input but does not return data to the client.p  pSo I think what I need is a node cluster where each node is a big data node AND a competent processing node in order to avoid traffic between the storage and processing clusters because now they are one. A node is responsible for processing on the files it stores so network bandwidth is avoided. If a node happens to be overloaded with processing requests, that node may then offload some work to neighboring nodes thus still incurring bandwidth costs but only when necessary.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongbr 1 Wikimedia uses file servers and emseparateem image scaler servers...but in my case Im worried about large, unnecessary bandwidth. Is my worry justified, and therefore is the separation of storageprocessing nodes inappropriate in my casep  p2 Is my approach cluster of big storage  powerful processing nodes desirable Or should I be considering a different architecture p  p2 Ive considered Hadoop but dont know if it is suited to the task huge bandwidth cost and Im not really processing bigdata.

Negative 458 pWe are writing unit tests for our business layer running under .NET 4.0.  The business layer is a straightforward C class library that usually runs within SOAP and REST web services.  Our application uses log4net within a separate wrapper assembly for logging.  The C code in the logging assembly has an assembly info directive that tells log4net the name of the configuration file, a lap  p[assembly log4net.Config.XmlConfiguratorConfigFileAcmeLogging.config, Watchtrue]p  pInitializing the log4net through the wrapper works fine in the web services.  When we initialize it from with our unit test assembly it does not appear to see the configuration file.  The configuratino file is configured through properties to be copied to the execution directory, and we do see it in the bindebug directory.  A quick console test program using the logging assembly running from within that same folder works fine.  The curious thing is that the behavior problems are intermittent, and pop up on different developers machines at different times and cannot be cured in any deterministic way.p  pStepping through the wrapper assembly code, the log4netLogManager.GetLogger call appears to return correctly, but the list of appenders returned by log.Logger.Repository.GetAppenders is empty.  Since this incorrect behavior is the same whether the file is in the BinDebug folder or not, we believe that it is not seeing the file.p  pAny clues as to what were missing about running log4net in the Microsoft Test Framework would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 458 pI am currently working on a VPS panel that uses a masterslave model. One master server runs a panel written in PHP, and manages multiple slave servers via SSH. The slave servers are accessed via a limited account, that can sudo to specific server administrationrelated commands, and all interaction is logged in a directory that the account itself does not have access to.p  pI am currently using PHPSSH2, but this approach has a few problemsp  ul liExit codes are not reliably returned, so all commands have to be executed in a wrapper script that packages up stdout, stderr, and the exit code into a JSON object and returns it via stdout. This script has to exist on every slave server.li liThe PHPSSH2 library does not know the concept of a custom connection timeout, which means I have to probe a server with fsockopen before trying to use PHPSSH2 to connect  if I dont do that, an unreachable server may delay the pageload for a minute or more. This is even more worse because of the next issue.li liPersistent connections are not possible. This causes absolutely ridiculous pageload times in the panel, especially combined with the previous issue with timeouts.li ul  pRight now, Im trying to solve the last problem primarily.p  pThere are several possible solutions I have run across, but all of them have an issue of some sortp  ul liUsing PHPSecLib, a pure PHP SSH implementation, and replacing all fsockopen calls with pfsockopen calls. This will make the connections persistent, but its hackier than Id like and the security implications of persistent sockets in PHP are unclear.li liSetting up a persistent SSH tunnel from the master server to each slave server, and running a simple daemon bound to localhost on each slave server that runs whatever its told to. This is a problem for two reasons. First off it introduces the need for a daemon on the slave servers, which is something Id rather avoid. The second issue is that if someone were to compromise a limited account on a slave server, they could still run certain system commands simply by connecting to the command daemon, even if they would not have access to those commands from their own shell. This is a problem.li liRunning a daemon on the master server that manages persistent SSH connections to slave servers on behalf of the panel. This would involve writing an SSH client in Python this is the only suitable language I am familiar with, and would probably come down to using paramiko. Since the documentation of paramiko is poor, this isnt a very attractive option and may even cause security issues because it isnt entirely clear to me how things are emsupposedem to be used in paramiko.li ul  pThe following are not an optionp  ul liSwitching to a different language for the panel itself. I am writing the panel in PHP because that is the language I am most familiar with, and Im aware of the quirks and potential issues I might encounter. Writing an important publicfacing project like this in a language I am not familiar with would be a bad idea.li liUsing Twisted for the third possible solution. Twisted is a very large and convoluted dependency, and the documentation seems even worse than that of paramiko.li liRunning a HTTPd or otherwise nonSSH publicfacing daemon on the slave servers.li ul  pIn practice, I am seeing pageload times of sometimes over a minute when multiple servers have to be contacted for a pageload. This is obviously not acceptable for a VPS panel.p  pMy goal is to have some kind of implementation that avoids the connection overhead that is introduced when using PHPSSH2. What would be the best way to do this, in a secure manner, while introducing a minimal amount of dependencies on the slave serversp

Negative 458 pIm trying to hide an implementation of a class I do not own. Im wanting to do this my extending the class and implementing an interface of my own. Here is how an instance of the class I need is createdp  precodeQueueInfo info  admin.getQueuequeueName codepre  pQueueInfo is the class I do not own. To get an instance of this object, I have to use an admin object to get it. I am wanting to hide this implementation by working through an interface called IQueueInfo. IQueueInfo will just give access to what consumers need from QueueInfo. So to get at this QueueInfo, I would like work through my own object called EMSQueueInfo. Here is how I envision setting this upp  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo      ...  codepre  pThis allows my consumer to work though the interface IQueueInfo and it allows the underlying EMSQueueInfo to have access to everything QueueInfo has. My problem lies with getting a live instance of QueueInfo. To get a regular instance of QueueInfo, I could just sayp  precodeQueueInfo info  new QueueInfoqueueName codepre  pThis instance is not live as in it was not created by the admin object. So, doing thisp  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo       public EMSQueueInfoString queueName         superqueueName        codepre  pdoes not give me a live object. What I would love to be able to do is something like thisp  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo       public EMSQueueInfoString queueName, Admin admin         super  admin.getQueuequeueName        codepre  pBut that is impossible.p  pThe only solution Im seeing is removing the extends from my EMSQueueInfo class and just wrapping the object up myself, getting access to all of the methods via a private varialbep  precodepublic class EMSQueueInfo extends QueueInfo implements IQueueInfo       private QueueInfo queueInfo      public EMSQueueInfoString queueName, Admin admin         queueInfo  admin.getQueuequeueName           public int getMessagesOnQueue          return queueInfo.getMessagesOnQueue        codepre  pThat solution does work, but I kind of hate it. Can anyone think of a better way Am I just trying to break OO and misuse it Again, Im only doing all of this because I want consumers to be able to work with IQueueInfo, in the future, IQueueInfo could be used to access a JMS implementation of QueueInfo or an MSMQ implementation of QueueInfo. Any help would be amazingp

Somebody else will implement the .Net code.p  pThe running sequence should be along this line p  ol liServer is running...li liClient initiates conversation, registers to the server, and requests some initial data.li liServer keeps a list of registered clients endpointsli liIn the server there is a listener that is notified when certain events happen. It will then go through the list of registered clients and forwards the event to each of themli liAt some point, the client can unregister no notify the server that it doesnt want to receive events any more.li ol  pFirst, does it sound like something reasonably doable p  pAnd is there a standard builtin mechanism, using SOAP JAXWS on the server, whatever is available with .Net n the client  that the server can use to obtain a callback endpoint from the client p  pFor example, I did something very similar using RMI, in this case the client can just send a remote reference to itself, that the server can just store ant refer to later.p  pFinally, is there a standard library to store endpoints references, make collective callbacks, and maybe keep the list uptodate, removing the clients that dont respond so some ping call p  pNote for clarity  I need more than just asynchronous method with callback one message from the client will generate many callback messages from server to client.p

I shouldnt need to set this up on more than just my OS X dev machine, but like I mentioned before, having this capability over SSH would be epic. p  pAre there any other quickanddirty UNIXy approaches to this problem p

Negative 458 pSeveral weeks ago I finished my facebook login screen in my app, everything worked fine. Today when I was going to login, my app asked for the permissions, I accepted and then instead of run normally and take me to the main screen, throw me an intent to the browser showing this url and a message of This web page cant be displayed. The url was fbconnectsuccessaccesstoken.....ampexpiretime...... I not changed anything in the code nor in the facebook app. The strange thing is that in my facebook page the permissions to the app are granted. Is how if the first thing that the facebook sdk does is launch this intent, but I dont know why. After the permissions are granted in the LoginActivity of the facebook sdk, the first thing that this should do is call the onActivityResult of my own LoginActivity and later call the callback that handles the session changes. But this never happens, the LoginActivity of the facebook sdk launchs this intent to the browser and then everything crashes. Of course from the server side of facebook the permissions to my app are actually granted. I didnt post code because was working several weeks ago, also is only a LoginButton widget, the UiHelper and the session change callback theres no much science in that. Anyone knows some related errorp

Negative 458 pAs per my understanding dlls are dynamically loaded at run time and static libraries.lib files are loaded during linking. I also have understood that there are two types of .lib files. One is static .lib files which means that during linking these files will be linked with the code that I have written. Another type of .lib files are simply import files, which merely tells the linker the path of the .dll files which may be in system32 or sysWoW64 folder. Is my understanding correctp  pNow I have few doubts on how this whole system of .lib and .dll files work.p  pI have compile freeglut libraries and in the lib folder I have 3 important files. freeglut.lib, freeglutstatic.lib and freeglut.dll.

Negative 458 pI spent all morning searching, but havent found anything yet. Really need your help for a javascript or creative hack to hide Safaris lower navigation bar when viewing our mobile app on iPhone. Our mobile site was built in jQuery Mobile. We have no need for the navigation bar since we have our own back button, and were trying to reclaim that extra real estate. Most importantly, we want the site to feel more like a native app without having to go thru all the packagingIOS steps, posting in the app stores etc, just to get the safari nav bar removed. We were able to hide the URL address bar theres plenty of great solutions there. I do already know the meta tag  etc for adding to iphone home screen to remove the safari bars. That only helps a really small portion of the customers, maybe 1. So basically looking for a creative hack to hide Safaris lower navigation bar when viewing our mobile app on iPhone.

Negative 458 pI have searched for days and can find no answers that solve my problem.  I have a simple webform website, on it are some textboxes that show when the user selects the custom search option.  When I test locally it works, but when I publish it to our webserver the textboxes stop working.  I noticed that the hover cursor on the webserver switches from the expected text cursor to the pointer cursor.  The text cursor shows If I move the cursor to the edge of the textbox, and allows me to click the textbox and type text as needed, but when I move the mouse so no part of it is touching the edge of the textbox but is inside the textbox then it becomes the pointer cursor and no matter how hard I press the mouse button I can not activate the textbox to type in it.

Negative 458 pthis is a bug that has been troubling and demotivating me for several days now. Perhaps someone has some insight.p  pI build a terrain mesh programmatically and set up a renderable for it, with a material that has a texture attribute with a repeating texture created from a PNG file. All of this appears to work fine until the camera is moved for a while, along, say, the x or z axes, at which time the texture will initially flicker to black, and eventually stay black, if the camera is moved far enough away.p  pI clear the screen with blue  so the mesh is still getting rendered, just without the texture  so it is solid black. This happens at the same spots with regards to camera placement. Once the camera is far enough away, the problem persists if the camera continues to move away from the world origin.p  pThe problem does not appear on desktop, only android. I am using an HTC EVO 4G to test. I realize that this phones early Adreno GPU has some serious 3D issues, but Ive surely seen games, or at least demos, with large textured landscapes work fine.

But I receive sometimes an access violation on the line where I call codestdmap.findcode.p  pSometimes means If one codestdweakptrcode is added to the map, then erased because it couldnt be locked  and an new codestdsharedptrcode is constructed, added as codestdweakptrcode to the codestdmapcode.

Negative 458 pI am trying to run unit tests for Mac application in xcode 5.0 .p  pThe unit tests run fine if I have the sandbox disabled but as soon as I enabled the sandbox the tests are unable to run, failing with error loading bundle emIDEBundleInjection.c Error loading bundleem.p  pIve seen a few other reports about this error and looks like the general assumption is that it wont work. The suggested workaround is to create a new configuration in xcode with sandboxing disabled and running the tests with that configuration. p  pThis works, of course, but it seems like a poor workaround since it will be running the tests in a different environment than the real application normally would and potentially missing on a whole category of bugs resulting from different permissions, directories etc.p  pI can hardly believe that Apple intended developers to disable sandboxing for testing, seems very short sighted.

Negative 458 pI am working on a cordovaphonegap based geolocation app using Google maps. I am using Cordova 2.4 if that matters for this issue. I am getting the location coordinates from the phone and show it as a marker on the map. I also, use the reverse googles geolocation to get the address corresponding to that location. However, the map thing is working fine in India. It displays the marker on the map and also gets the address for that location. However, when I sent the same app to my friend in the US to test, he could not see the map or the marker and also could not get the address corresponding to that GPS coordinates. He did get the alert for the GPS coordinates which I had added for debugging purposes. p  pSo, it seems there is an issue probably with the Maps API not working in the US. I sent it to multiple people in the US and all of them had same issues. Whereas it worked in India on multiple device like Nexus 4, Nexus S, Galaxy S2 etc. p  pThe app checks if the location services are enabled using Cordova plugin and if not, it asks users to do that. p  pI then created a console API key and used that but still the same result console API Key was generated for my gmail account which is based in India.p  pI would like to know if there are any restrictions to view google maps data for US addresses with API key for an account that is India based, or using no key which works in India. p  pANy help will be appreciated.p  pThanks, Manishp  pUPDATE fixed the issue.

Negative 458 pI am currently trying to delete from Table A where a corresponding record is not being used in Table B.  Table A has Section, SubSection, Code, Text as fields, where the first three are the Primary Key.  Table B has ID, Section, SubSection, Code as fields, where all four are the Primary Key.  There are more columns, but they are irrelevant to this question...just wanted to point that out before I get questioned on why all columns are part of the Primary Key for Table B.  Pretty much Table A is a repository of all possible data that can be assigned to a entity, Table B is where they are assigned.  I want to delete all records from table A that are not in use in Table B.  I have tried the following with no successp  precodeDELETE FROM Table A  WHERE NOT EXISTS SELECT  from Table B  WHERE A.section  B.section AND A.subsection  B.subsection AND A.code  b.code codepre  pIf I do a Select instead of a delete, I get the subset I am looking for, but when I do a delete, I get an error saying that there is a syntax error at Table A.  I would use a NOT IN statement, but with multiple columns being part of the Primary Key, I just dont see how that would work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 458 pI have two environments, in one of them I put my application using spring integration and it works perfectly. But in the second enviroment when I try to connect with the server, I get a time out error. I suppose that the error is becouse of a some configuration of the network topology but I not really sure. I did a test application using spring integration using the  configuration described herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19815964howcanisetdefaultoutgoingportandlisteningportonspringintegrationHow can I set default outgoing port and listening port on spring integrationap  pThe idea of setting outgoing port is just to control where is going the information. But this test application failed to connect and throw the same error as my application. I made a second test, in this case using the usual java classes to create a tcp client, and the test worked fine. So my suspicions are arround the configuration of spring integration and somesomething with the network too.

Negative 458 pIm building an app w JQM and Phonegap 3.1, wherein a canvas with a lot of animation and interactivity sits immediately below the JQM header. The user can make the canvas fullscreen, in which case I hide the header.p  pI noticed early on that if I use a fixed header, then try to hide it, rather than the canvas sliding up as it would with a nonfixed header, the top inch of the screen where the header used to be shows an exact mirror duplicate of the top inch of the canvas. Including all the animation. And it does this apparently without slowing down the app. Its just as if the canvas is being blitted twice.p  pSimple enough, I think, I wont used fixed headers. I havent seen the behavior for a month. But yesterday, testing on a colleagues phone, out of nowhere I got two fullsized copies of the canvas when the page loaded, one above the other with the top one mirroring the interactivity on the bottom one, exactly.p  pWhile I do have a spare, hidden canvas element thats used for predrawing sprites, theres no way it could receive a second copy of the interactive code  and even if it did, theres no way it would be syncd to what was going on in the first copy. So I dont think I was looking at a second canvas, I think I was looking at a very lowlevel redraw bug.p  pIt wasnt reproducible. I had turned the phone horizontal at the load screen and then back at some point to vertical, the time it cropped up, but after dozens of attempts I wasnt able to make it happen again.p  pHas anyone seen this kind of behavior happen, and is there a way to avoid itp

I know some possibilities to address thisp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4098753settingnewpropertiesincategoryinterfaceimplementation titleuse a singleton registryuse a singleton registryali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6162589objectivecinstancevariableincategory titleuse associated referencesobjcsetAssociatedObject and objcgetAssociatedObjectali ul  pFrom my point of view both is not clean since the memory allocated is never cleared when the object that created such properties is deallocated.p  pCategories are a good way to keep code clean and dynamically add functionality to already existing classes. They help to group functionality and to distributed implementation work among more developers.p  pThe bad about categories is the missing storage.p  pI came across this problem several times now and Im wondering whether the following would address this problem in an clean way that also takes care about the memory and if there are any problems that I cant see right now.p  pThere is strongone restrictionstrong, that I can ignore since Im working as a framework developer  Im able to create my strongown root classstrong that all my other classes can eminheritem from.p  pFirst of all declare the new root objectp  precodeinterface RootObject  NSObject   voidsetRuntimePropertyidruntimeProperty forKeyidltNSCopyinggtkey  idruntimePropertyForKeyidkey  end codepre  pWith the corresponding implementationp  precodeimport RootObject.h  interface RootObject  property readwrite NSMutableDictionary runtimeProperties end  implementation RootObject synthesize runtimeProperties  runtimeProperties   idinit      self  [super init]      if self              runtimeProperties  [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithCapacity1]           return self    voiddealloc      [runtimeProperties release]     runtimeProperties  nil      [super dealloc]    idruntimePropertyForKeyidkey      return [self.runtimeProperties objectForKeykey]    voidsetRuntimePropertyidruntimeProperty forKeyidltNSCopyinggtkey      if key              if runtimeProperty                      [self.runtimeProperties setObjectruntimeProperty forKeykey]                  else                      [self.runtimeProperties removeObjectForKeykey]                 end codepre  pBy using this codeRootObjectcode instead of codeNSObjectcode it should be very easy to add a property to a category on a class. Consider having some class codeMyClasscode p  precodeinterface MyClass  RootObject  some interface here end codepre  pWhen implementing a special behavior on top of this class you are now able to add a property like thisp  precodeinterface MyClass specialBehavior property nonatomic, retain NSString name property nonatomic, copy NSDate birthday end codepre  pWith corresponding implementationp  precodeimplementation MyClass specialBehavior dynamic name  NSString name      return [self runtimePropertyForKeyname]   voidsetNameNSString name      [self setRuntimePropertyname forKeyname]  dynamic birthday  NSDate birthday      return [self runtimePropertyForKeybirthday]   voidsetBirthdayNSDate birthday      [self setRuntimeProperty[birthday copy] forKeybirthday]  end codepre  pSuch an implementation could KVO compatible as well by just adding the necessary calls in the setter method. Very straight forward, but Im wondering whether I missed something important E.g. very very bad runtime performance having many such declared properties or using many of these objectsp

Negative 458 pIm using the LibUSBDotNet library in a WPF application that communicates with a simple USB device.

However, after awhile, every now and then, upon attempting to write again to the device I would get one of the following two errorsp  precodeWin32ErrorGetOverlappedResult Ep 0x01 31The parameter is incorrect.  Win32ErrorPipeTransferSubmit Ep 0x01 87The parameter is incorrect. codepre  pOften I need to restart the deviceapplication several times before it starts working again and then it goes another several hours working like a charm before it happens again... I have not been able to replicate the crash so far in a testing environment either.p  pI did a lot of research trying to find a problemsolution similar to mine with no success. The only suggestion that I have left is that at some point the device does not have enough power and it goes into this error mode but even that seems unlikely as it has a separate 12V power supply and all that it does is to switch on and off several relays...p  pIve also tried flooding the device with a lot of consecutive commands one after another, including garbage ones but it still works and behaves properly only to crash a little bit later.p  pOpen to any suggestions or ideas, thank youp  pEDIT After many attempts Im still not able to identify the root cause of the issue but I managed to get to a point where my code is working and is able to recover from the OverlappedResult error using reconnect functions that try to reset the device once it starts failing. Im posting some code below and hopefully someone will be able to narrow down the issue and identify the cause of the error.p  pSome code during initializationp  precode        UsbDeviceFinder MyUsbFinder         UsbDevice MyUsbDevice         IUsbDevice wholeUsbDevice                  MyUsbFinder  new UsbDeviceFindervid, pid                 MyUsbDevice  UsbDevice.OpenUsbDeviceMyUsbFinder                      wholeUsbDevice  MyUsbDevice as IUsbDevice                     if ReferenceEqualswholeUsbDevice, null                                               This is a whole USB device. Before it can be used,                           the desired configuration and interface must be selected.                          I think those do make some difference...                           Select config 1                         wholeUsbDevice.SetConfiguration1                           Claim interface 0.                         wholeUsbDevice.ClaimInterface0                                           writer  MyUsbDevice.OpenEndpointWriterWriteEndpointID.Ep01 codepre  pNext Im trying to send some information to the device.

Finally, heres my reconnect function that manages to reestablish connection to the device 99 of the time without having to manually restart the device and plugunplug usb cables, etcp  precodepublic bool reconnect      clear the info so far     if MyUsbDevice  null              writer.Dispose         wholeUsbDevice.ReleaseInterface0         wholeUsbDevice.Close         MyUsbDevice.Close         UsbDevice.Exit           now start over     MyUsbFinder  new UsbDeviceFindervid, pid     MyUsbDevice  UsbDevice.OpenUsbDeviceMyUsbFinder       If the device is open and ready     if MyUsbDevice  null              log the error         return false          else              wholeUsbDevice  MyUsbDevice as IUsbDevice         if ReferenceEqualswholeUsbDevice, null                       Select config 1             wholeUsbDevice.SetConfiguration1               Claim interface 0.             wholeUsbDevice.ClaimInterface0                   writer  MyUsbDevice.OpenEndpointWriterWriteEndpointID.Ep01          return true       codepre  pThats pretty much it so far. The combination of SetConfigurationClaimInterfaceDispose reduce the times I see the OverlappedResult error and whenever that happens, judging from my logs, Im able to recover right away and resend the command to the device. As I said above, this is a workaround to the problem as Im still getting the error every now and then and I still have no idea why, but at least Im able to continue working with the device at this point. Would love to find out more on this issue if anyone has more insights. Thanks and I hope this helpsp

Negative 458 pI am still struggling with getting a chain of deferred promises working on a Visual Web Part.  The end goal is to change the colour of some DIV tags to colours referenced in a SPList.  p  pI originally had this code working with a single request to lookup data from a list, but I am now looking for a chain of requests.  The first is finding name of the Sub Site from the window.location.href property.  Although this code is retrieving the sub site name thinking about this as if type this might be my first mistake and perhaps I should be getting this from the SPWeb object instead.  The second then uses this value in a where clause to retrieve the correct data from the second call to a different list.p  pSo the code if have at the moment works, but is intermittent.  I think Im not calling .resolve in the correct place, and it is just luck as to if the async code has completed before the calling thread uses the expected result.  It is therefore in the lap of the processor gods and probably works 5050.

Negative 458 pI am writing a library for various mathematical computations in C. Several of these need some scratch space  memory that is used for intermediate calculations. The space required depends on the size of the inputs, so it cannot be statically allocated. The library will typically be used to perform many iterations of the same type of calculation with the same size inputs, so Id prefer not to codemalloccode and codefreecode inside the library for each call it would be much more efficient to allocate a large enough block once, reuse it for all the calculations, then free it.p  pMy intended strategy is to request a codevoidcode pointer to a single block of memory, perhaps with an accompanying allocation function. Say, something like thisp  precodevoid allocateScratchsizet rows, sizet columns void doCalculationsizet rows, sizet columns, double data, void scratch codepre  pThe idea is that if the user intends to do several calculations of the same size, he may use the allocate function to grab a block that is large enough, then use that same block of memory to perform the calculation for each of the inputs. The allocate function is not strictly necessary, but it simplifies the interface and makes it easier to change the storage requirements in the future, without each user of the library needing to know exactly how much space is required.p  pIn many cases, the block of memory I need is just a large array of type codedoublecode, no problems there. But in some cases I need mixed data types  say a block of doubles AND a block of integers. My code needs to be portable and should conform to the ANSI standard. I know that it is OK to cast a codevoidcode pointer to any other pointer type, but Im concerned about alignment issues if I try to use the same block for two types.p  pSo, specific example. Say I need a block of 3 codedoublecodes and 5 codeintcodes. Can I implement my functions like thisp  precodevoid allocateScratch...      return malloc3  sizeofdouble  5  sizeofint   void doCalculation..., void scratch      double dblArray  scratch     int intArray  unsigned charscratch  3  sizeofdouble  codepre  pIs this legal The alignment probably works out OK in this example, but what if I switch it around and take the codeintcode block first and the codedoublecode block second, that will shift the alignment of the codedoublecodes assuming 64bit doubles and 32bit ints. Is there a better way to do this Or a more standard approach I should considerp  pMy biggest goals are as followsp  ul liId like to use a single block if possible so the user doesnt have to deal with multiple blocks or a changing number of blocks required.li liId like the block to be a valid block obtained by codemalloccode so the user can call codefreecode when finished. This means I dont want to do something like creating a small codestructcode that has pointers to each block and then allocating each block separately, which would require a special destroy function Im willing to do that if thats the only way.li liThe algorithms and memory requirements may change, so Im trying to use the allocate function so that future versions can get different amounts of memory for potentially different types of data without breaking backward compatibility.li ul  pMaybe this issue is addressed in the C standard, but I havent been able to find it.p

Negative 458 pAs a project gets bigger and bigger, I get a bit confused as to what types of exceptions should be thrown and where they should be caught, e.g. how to organize internal exceptions vs exception messages that should be shown to the end user. To keep confusion down, is it best practice to always catch an exception in the higherlevel objectp  pTake this example if I have a database class that inserts a row into the database, and that class is called by another object that processes data, and in turn this data processing object is called by a controller, is it correct to catch errors from the database class in the processing class, which possibly rethrows the error to be caught in the controller class Or can an error thrown in the database class be caught in the controller classp  pAdditionally, if one method in the processing class is called by another method in the same class, and the first throws an error, is it ok to catch the exception in the same class Or should it be deferred to the higherlevel class thats calling itp  pAre there any other tips on how to structure and organize exceptions in large projects with many levels of classesp

Negative 458 pHi I am very new to web app development. I am creating a Java web app. Safe to assume that the web app will be used by multiple clients at the same time. Inside my app I wish to call a static method. It is a generic method and so there is no need to create an object just for that. Is there a processing penalty by doing that Since method was declared static will there be only one method for all web clients to share Will this be a bottle neck Whats the best practice regarding this Thanks thanks.p

Negative 458 pI have built a small web based application to help us with a few jobs at work running on a local web server, my colleagues have for years used the QuickFind feature in Firefox pressing the forward slash key to search the page when using my application. p  pIm in the process of rebuilding this and have run into a problem. My application now uses alot of jQuery including a hashchange function to load the page content and modal windows.

This same problem occurs when I load a modal window, once the modal has loaded the hot key no longer works.p  pHas anyone got any idea what may be causing this and how to fix it Currently the only other option I can see is to write my own search function but its really not a route Id like to take if it can be avoided.p

Negative 458 pIve been struggling a weird problem the last few days. We create some libraries using GCC 4.8 which link some of their dependencies statically  eg. log4cplus or boost. For these libraries we have created Python bindings using boostpython.p  pEvery time such a library used TLS like log4cplus does in its static initialization or stdlibc does when throwing an exception  not only during initialization phase the whole thing crashed in a segfault  and every time the address of the thread local variable has been 0.p  pI tried everything like recompiling, ensuring fPIC is used, ensuring tlsmodelglobaldynamic is used, etc. No success. Then today I found out that the reason for these crashes has been our way of linking OpenMP in. We did this using lgomp instead of just using fopenmp. Since I changed this everything works fine  no crashes, no nothing. Finep  pBut Id really like to know what the cause of the problem was. So whats the difference between these two possibilities to link in OpenMPp  pWe have a CentOS 5 machine here where we have installed a GCC4.8 in optlocalgcc48 and we are also sure that the libgomp coming from optlocalgcc48 had been used as well as the libstdc from there DLDEBUG used.p  pAny ideas Havent found anything on Google  or I used the wrong keywords p
Negative 458 pIs the FQL for their API only returning results that the user marks as public in the privacy settingsp  pI notice in the Graph API Explorer you are able to request certain permissions before running some of the FQL queries.

Take the time and explain why it is down voted and what is wrong with the question.  It helps more than the OP and shows you actually care more about the content and having everyone understand why the question may be wrong in your eyes than a simple down vote that doesnt help anything.

Negative 458 pSO... p  pI have a Java FX application that runs an embedded HTTP Live Streaming server for video playback using the Media class NOT live streaming, video on demand. The video playback consists of multiple files that are actually storing a collection of RTP packets.

So I cannot create a .h264 file, use ffmpeg to create a .ts file, read the ts file and then write the contents to the response body. p  pAs far as I can tell, Xuggler does not work with streams and JCodec is slow. I am fairly confident that I can dig into and understand the MPEG2 TS format and simply convert the RAW H264 into the appropriate format, but this seems like a lot of needless work that should have been done before. p  pAnyone know of a simple way to convert RAW H264 to MPEG2 TS Or MP4 to MPEG2 TS I can use MP4Parser to create the MP4 data in memory quickly, I just need a java library that can generate MPEG2 TS data, thanksp

Negative 458 pA while ago, I had a C program that needed to call some functions in a C dll. I used pInvoke for that purpose. Some of the data I needed to pass in were structs. So, I would use the pInvoke Signature Toolkit to find out how to create a C struct that was equivalent to the struct that the C function took by reference. Then, I was able to pass these structs to the C code.p  pNow, I have sort of the opposite situation. I am in C code, and I am being handed comptrt object. This is essentially a pointer to a C object. The C object implements a COM interface with properties like getFoo, setFoo, etc., that I can use to pull values generally, they are just basic data types like float, bool, int, etc. from the C object and stuff them into my C counterpart. p  pThis works well, but its a little bit slow. When I profile my code, it spends a lot of time in clr. So, Im hoping to find a faster way, where I can perhaps add a function to the COM interface that will copy the entire C object into the C counterpart struct at once  sort of like how I did it with pInvoke above, except Im pulling the data from C code through a COM interface, rather than passing data TO C code through a pInvoke interface.p  pDoes anybody know of a way to do thatp

Negative 458 pWere trying to implement deferred deep linking in one of our iOS applications to encourage users to invite their friends to use the app, and reward users based on how many installs occur from their referral link. Basically similar to a hrefhttpstapstream.comdeveloperdeferreddeeplinksTapStreams producta.p  pConsider this examplep  blockquote   pSo, UserA shares their link, ourappURL.comreferiduserA, on any   network they want. UserB clicks that link, which will take them to   Safari and then bounce them to the App Store page where UserB   downloads the app. p      pWhen UserB opens the app, the app checks which referral ID they came   in on if any. In this example, the referral ID would be userA as   thats the ID that was in the referral link. The app then send this to   our servers and we award UserA with a referral credit.p blockquote  pIm trying to break this issue down into its core parts. I believe the first part is getting the web page for the users referral link to save the referral ID to the device somewhere that the app can access it. But Im not sure this is possible because of the sandboxed nature of iOS. p  pI know this is fundamentally possible because many ad providers offer the ability to track installs from an ad campaign see Mobile App Tracking for example.p

Negative 458 pI have a repository that has grown too big to the point it has become unusable. Basically my repository is over 2GB and takes too long to clone.

Negative 458 pI am creating an Android app that uses OpenGL, and I want the FreeGLUT functionality for things like drawing simple shapes spheres, cubes, etc. Following the tutorial a hrefhttpwww.learnopengles.comcallingopenglfromandroidusingthendk relnofollowherea, I have managed to get my app to run native C OpenGL code to display a red screen using the Android NDK. However, now I am having trouble including FreeGLUT, which was a hrefhttpfreeglut.sourceforge.netdocsandroid.php relnofollowrecently updated in version 3.0 to work in Androida. That link provides some documentation on how to use FreeGLUT in my Android project, but I am having issues getting it to work. I am working in Eclipse on Ubuntu.p  pSpecifically, I downloaded the prebuilt archive provided on that page the first link under Compiling and want to include it in my Android app. I have tried including the freeglutgles as a module in Eclipse, which sort of worked but has issues. First, it couldnt find the freeglutglesliblibfreeglutgles.a library or header files under GL such as codeltGLfreeglut.hgtcode, which I noticed were under freeglut3androidmodulesinstallinndksysrootusrlib and freeglut3androidmodulesinstallinndksysrootusrincludeGL respectively freeglut3androidmodules is the directory extracted from the prebuilt archive. The directory name installinndk seems to indicate that it is possible to install this lib and include header files in my NDK, but I dont know how to do that. I tried just copying the files to the freeglutgles module, which got rid of those errors but now gives the following error fatal error GLgl.h No such file or directory. Im assuming thats due to a linking error and I need to somehow link usrincludeGL which has gl.h and other OpenGL header files, but Im not sure how to do that with ndkbuild or my Android.mk maybe that would be done if I properly install the installinndk directory.p  pFor reference, here is my jniAndroid.mkp  precodeLOCALPATH  call mydir  include CLEARVARS  LOCALMODULE     opengl NDKMODULEPATH  LOCALPATH..

Negative 458 pI have been curious about this for some time. I can live with that, but it always bites me when enough care is not taken, so I decide to post it here. Suppose the following example Numpy version  1.8.2p  precodea  array[[0, 1], [2, 3]] print shapea[00, ]  0, 2 print shapea[01, ]  1, 2 print shapea[02, ]  2, 2 print shapea[0100, ]  2, 2  print shapea[0]  2,  print shapea[0, ]  2,  print shapea[, 0]  2,  codepre  pI dont know how other people feel, but the result feels inconsistent to me. The last line is a column vector while the second to last line is a row vector, they should have different dimension  in linear algebra they do Line 5 is another surprise, but I will neglect it for now. Consider a second examplep  precodesolution  scipy.sparse.linalg.dsolve.linsolve.spsolveA, b  solution of dimension n,  analytic  reshapefx, y, n, 1  analytic of dimension n, 1 error  solution  analytic codepre  pNow error is of dimension n, n. Yes, in the second line I should use n,  instead of n, 1, but why I used to use MATLAB a lot, where oned vector has dimension n, 1, linspacearange returns array of dimension n, 1, and there never exists n, . But in Numpy n, 1 and n,  coexist, and there are many functions for dimension handling alone atleast, newaxis and different uses of reshape, but to me those functions are more of confusion than help. If an array print like [1,2,3], then intuitively the dimension should be [1,3] instead of [3,], right If Numpy does not have n, , I can only see a gain in clarity, not a loss in functionality.p  pSo there must be some design reason behind this. I have been searching from time to time, without finding a clear answer or report. Could someone help clarifying this confusion or provide me some useful references Your help is much appreciated.p

Negative 458 pI would like to know how to combine two or more adjacent elements of an array.p  pFor example, I have an array arr  code[a,bb,ccc,d,e,f,g,hhhhhhhh]code and I want to concatenate some elements to make it code[a,bb, ccc, defg,hhhhhhhh]code.  Specifically, I want to do the following if an elements length is less than its index plus one, I want to concatenate it with the element that follows, eliminating the element that follows.  I.e., for this example, because codearr[3].lengthcode lt 31, it gets concatenated with the elements that follow it until codearr[3].length  31code.  Ill be executing this from inside a loop, and working from left to right in the array.p  pIs there any easy way to do this in JavaScriptp  pThanksp

I saw that List.Remove calls a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.commscorlibsystemarray.cs,156e066ecc4ccedf relnofollowArray.IndexOfa to find the item, and Array.IndexOf first tries to use a native method called TrySZIndexOf to find the item.p  precode Try calling a quick native method to handle primitive types. int retVal bool r  TrySZIndexOfarray, startIndex, count, value, out retVal if r     return retVal codepre  pThe declaration of TrySZIndexOf isp  precodeprivate static extern bool TrySZIndexOfArray sourceArray, int sourceIndex, int count, Object value, out int retVal codepre  pIf TrySZIndexOf returns False, Array.IndexOf iterates through all the items in the array.p  pThe comments suggest that TrySZIndexOf is an optimised method of searching an array of primitive types.

Negative 458 pHibernate requires a noargs constructor and in all languages that does support method overloading thats probably not an issue, but Ive faced a really annoying issue in ColdFusion ORM which relies on Hibernate under the hood.p  pIf I declare a custom constructor an init method for my entities and that constructor requires some arguments, Hibernate fails to rehydrate my entities because its calling the custom constructor.p  pBecause of that behavior, it seems almost impossible to design alwaysvalid entities and therefore makes CFORM close to being completely useless.p  pThe only workaround I found is to declare another custom method that I use as a constructor which makes instanciating objects now look like codenew SomeEntity.construct...code or codecreateObjectcomponent, SomeEntity.construct...code. Thats quite cumbersome...p  pWhats very stupid in all this is that you can instanciate an entity without calling the codeinitcode method using codecreateObjectcode, so I wonder why they decided to make Hibernate call the codeinitcode method in their implementation, considering the fact that its not even passing parameters and sets them afterwards by other means.p  pAnyway, is there any other work around for that issuep  pEDIT p  pa hrefhttpsbugbase.adobe.comindex.cfmeventbugampid4012852 relnofollowI filed a bug in the Adobe Bugbasea.p

Negative 458 pbr Im writing simple popup application integrated with Asterisk server. Our test environment is based on FreePBX where weve configured a few SIP trunks. The test is between two extensions 3000 and 3001. br 3000, 3001 and other extensions are controlled by SIP client microsip for test purposes, later they may become some other sip clients or softphones.brp  pWhat I need is once someone calls extension 3000, an operator was able to answer the call using regular SIP client, while my application would show some information about the call.

Negative 458 pI am using Bootstrap and am having trouble with the navbar. In my navbar, I have a few divs that I want to be the full height of the navbar, but the navbar constantly seems to be just a bit taller than the divs inside.

Check out this jsFiddlep  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net2fax4vme relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.net2fax4vmeap  pNote the three code.rhombuscode divs. They should be the full height of the navbar, but there is 5 pixels of extra space under them.

Negative 458 pI am trying to recreate the same functionality that came with OhLife daily journaling web app fueled by daily email reminders  unfortunately closed off and am facing a challenge so far Ive dedicated a hash to every email I sent out, the hash being stored in the database allowed me upon receiving an answer from the user to safely reconcile the email to its user and the related day. I just realized that OhLife had found a way to actually rely on a single email address per user to manage it, which would also help me power my next feature proactive daily entry without necessarily having to answer the daily reminder.p  pCould it be that they only relied on parsing the subject of the email formatted along the lines of Its Mon, Mar 23... I cant help but feel that might not be ideal as it is depending on the user not changing anything in the email subject, yet its the best solution I came up with so far.p

Negative 458 pIn ROBLOX Lua, Im writing a game that involves users creating and running Lua scripts. Obviously, I need to prevent the use of certain services and functions, such as the Kick function on the Player class, or anything related to DataStore or TeleportService.p  pSo far, Ive been successful at making a sandboxed environment by using setfenv to set a functions environment to a metatable, which is attached to a sandbox table. On index, if nothing is found in the sandbox table, it looks in the real environment like it normally would. This allows me to put fake functions in the sandbox table that will be used instead of their real counterparts.p  pHowever, lets say I sandboxed the ClearAllChildren function. Players could easily escape the sandbox by doing thisp  precodesomeObject.Parent.someObjectClearAllChildren codepre  pThis is because getting an instances Parent gives them the real version as opposed to the sandboxed version. This flaw can be pulled off many other ways, too.p  pSo I made an object wrapper. Calling wrapobj on an instance returns a fake version created with newproxytrue. The index of its metatable makes sure any child of the object or instance property such as Parent will return a wrapped version.p  pMy issue is likely with the way I have my wrapper set up. Attempting to call any method on an object inside the sandbox, like thisp  precodex  someObjectGetChildren codepre  pResults in the following errorp  precodeExpected  not . calling member function GetChildren codepre  pHeres the full code for my sandbox currentlyp  precodelocal ENV  getfenv  main environment   custom object wrapper function wrapobj     if pcallfunction return obj.IsA end then  hacky way to make sure its real         local realObj  obj         local fakeObj  newproxytrue         local meta  getmetatablefakeObj         meta[index]  function, key              TODO logic here to sandbox wrapped objects             return wraprealObj[key]  this is likely the source of method problem         end         meta[tostring]  function             return realObj.Name or realObj         end         meta[metatable]  Locked         return fakeObj     else         return obj     end end   sandbox table fake objectsfunctions local sandbox       game  wrapgame     Game  wrapGame     workspace  wrapworkspace     Workspace  wrapWorkspace     script  wrapscript     Instance           new  functiona, b             return wrapInstance.newa, b         end         sandboxed function function run     printscript.ParentGetChildren     printscript.Parent     script.ParentClearAllChildren end   setting up the function environment setfenvrun, setmetatablesandbox, index  ENV  run codepre  pHow can I fix thisp

Negative 458 pI am trying to write a program that will detect open ports across multiple flavors of UNIX and Linux on all interfaces on the system.  Research on this site and others led me to code similar top  precodetry      SocketServer s  new SocketServerport, 0, host.close  catch  Exception ex       do something here...  codepre  pAnd similar forp  precodeDatagramSocket d  new DatagramSocketport, host.close codepre  pThe code worked great on RHEL 6.  On AIX 7, HPUX 11.31 and Solaris 10 and 11, however, some open ports were not detected.  For example, the code did not report SSH TCP 22 open and there was a SSH daemon running on each system it is how I was connected to the systems.  But the SSH daemon was not the only open port that was not reported.p  pI came across a remark in one thread stating that using SocketServer did not seem to work well on Java 7 and later and suggested converting the code to a client socket connectionp  precodeSocket s  new Sockethost, port codepre  pThis code worked better but was much slower due to waiting for connections on closedinactive ports.  It also was not 100 accurate.  I can understand this being a situation where a program has claimed a port but is not accepting connections on that port.p  pI should note that I am using netstat output as my comparison base.  For example, on Linuxp  precode netstat protocolinet aln codepre  pSimilar on the othersp  precode netstat f inet an codepre  pI would love to use Javas native networking to solve this problem because it should work across all target platforms.  But I have not found a solution that works 100 across all the platforms.p  pSo, my questions. Has someone experienced this before and found a methodology that works across multiple platforms  And if so, would you please point me in its directionp  pThank you.p  pjohnp  h2Update 05052015h2  pFound some additional information thanks to a coworker who uncovered a lot of this.p  p1 All of the systems I am running on except for the RHEL 6 system have dual stacks IPv4 and IPv6.

An explanation can be found in the Oracle documentation found a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavanetdocfilesnetproperties.html relnofollowherea.p  p2 There can also be some interaction involved with the SOREUSEADDR and SOREUSEPORT socket options.

Negative 458 pI wont bother you with all the dry details of what is the assignment and the problem Im trying to solve, Ill cut right to the chase.p  pI need to fill a matrix with data. the matrix is square and everything is zero except the first 2 diagonals meaning codeM[i][i]code for codeicode between 0 and n1 and codeM[i][i1]code for codeicode between 0 and n2 are already filledp  pWe want to fill the matrix using this a bit complex formula.p  precodeM[i][j]maxaminM[i2][j],M[i1][j1] , bminM[i1][j1],M[i][j2] codepre  pThe result is an upper triangular matrix.

And I said the first 2 are given.p  pI wrote a code to fill the matrix and it is working as intended.p  pstrongHere is my problemstrongp  pSince it is an upper triangular matrix, the lower half is all zero. so there is no point in wasting memory and saving it. So I thought to myself instead of allocating an n by n matrix, I will allocate n rows, and to the first row ill allocate n spaces, to the second n1, to the third n2 and so on...p  pBut since we changed the dimensions of the matrix, the formula I wrote above to compute codeM[i][j]code is different now. In my opinion, we moves all the values in the codeithcode row, codeicode columns to the left. in row 0 nothing changed. in row 1, we pulled all the values 1 column to the left, etc. So if I understand correctlyp  precodeM[i][j]M[i][ji] codepre  pWhere codeMcode is our new matrix. And so plugging that in the formula abovep  precodeM[i][j]maxaminM[i2][ji],M[i1][j1i] , bminM[i1][j1i],M[i][j2i] codepre  pHowever now the program to fill the matrix is not working correctly.

Negative 458 pIm an intern working for a contractor company that receives several 80 page government contract proposals daily in the form of pdfs.  The emails containing these pdfs are sent to a specific folder within my individual company gmail account, and my task is to essentially sort them.  Im given a list of keywords from my company to help me separate the documents based on their relevancy to the types of tasks that my company wants to complete. Initially all I want to do is separate the important pdfs from the unimportant pdfs through an automated process based on those keywords. But ultimately, I would like to be able to automate entire process, this includes the process of opening my emails located in the specific folder, opening the link to the pdf proposal within the emails, and then finally determining whether the pdf qualifies as a good proposal for my company which is basically phase one of the assignment. The end product will hopefully be an automated accurate list of good and bad proposals that saves my higher ups and myself loads of time. p  pMy issue is I really have no idea where to start with this.. what language should I use to implement a script like this And in a general sense how would this process happen I can learn anything I need to know fairly quickly... I just need to know where to start since Ive never done anything like this.p  pThanksp

Negative 458 pIm using Python 2.7 and requests module. p  pIm trying to scrape data from a website that uses javascript to populate data. The websites navigation behavior is unpredictable with my script, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. The data Im after is contained in pages for specific dates and Im trying to get the last 6 months of data. So I scrape the first days data, increment my date, scrape again, etc. p  pThe website is structured as followsp  precodeMonthly Calendar calendarURL     Page 1 of date xxxxxxxx when you click on a date from monthly         Page 2 of date xxxxxxxx when you click next page from page 1         Page 3 of date xxxxxxxx when you click next page from page 2         etc.. to last page of date xxxxxxxx     Page 1 of date yyyyyyyy          Page 2 of date yyyyyyyy when you click next page from page 1         so on... codepre  pPage 1 through n of any given date all have the same url codeexample.comdatexxxxxxxxcode DateURL. The HTML for this page gets populated by javascript. Behind the scenes I see a request to a url which responds with the data I need. This RequestURL contains some parameters. One parameter I know indicates whether you receive closedcanceled items or pending items p1  C,A, or W  no idea what W is for. My dates are all in the past so everything I need is closedcanceled. The other parameters p2 and p3, both binary seem to indicate either 1st page of data or next page of data.  p  pfor examplep  precodep1  C p2  0 p3  1 this would return closedcanceled data for page 1 FRequestURL  p1  C p2  1 p3  0 this would return closedcanceled data for the next page from where you previously wereNRequestURL codepre  pto be clear, these urls would look something likep  precodeFRequestURL  httpswww.example.comindex.cfmp1Campp20ampp31 NRequestURL  httpswww.example.comindex.cfmp1Campp20ampp31 codepre  pand FRequestURL returns first page while every other page is accessible by requesting NRequestURL.p  pThere are other parameters in these URLs that seem to remain constant for all pages of any date. The only other parameter that changes seems to be a unix timestamp.p  pNote that these requestURLs have no date parameter. The date seems only to be in the referer header. The referer happens to be DateURL mentioned above. So I am requesting this data as followsp  precodes.postrequestURL, data  cookie, headers  referer myreferer this is shortened to s.postrequestURL below codepre  pBefore that my connection is opened as follows using requests and sslp  precodeclass MyAdapterHTTPAdapter     def initpoolmanagerself, connections, maxsize, blockFalse         self.poolmanager  PoolManagernumpoolsconnections,                                        maxsizemaxsize,                                        blockblock,                                        sslversionssl.PROTOCOLTLSv1 s  requests.Session s.mountMainURL, MyAdapter myreferer  DateURL s.headers.updatereferer myreferer codepre  pMy problemp  pAbout 50 of the time my first codes.postFrequestURLcode works great. I then do each of the next pages for that date by calling codes.postNrequestURLcode. Then I increment the date, update codemyreferercode to reflect the next day, and start over calling codes.postFrequestURLcode. This however ends up returning the same data for the first date, only formatted differently for some reason 2 items per page instead of 10. No idea why. p  pThe revealing bit is that the other 50 of the time my first call to codes.postFrequestURLcode returns data for whatever date I most recently visited in my browser. This led me to try calling codes.getmyreferercode or codes.getDateURLcode before every post but no dice it still goes with whatever Ive been looking at in my browser. p  pIve also noticed often that Ill run the program starting for day 1 then it will exit with code 1. Ill then run it again and on the first request it will receive day 2 instead of day 1. p  pI tried to be as detailed as possible but Im pretty new to programming so sorry if my language isnt descriptive enough. Any help would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 458 pI have an ASPClassic website, which uses a VBScript called ASPXTOASP.ASP to convert .Net request parameters into Classic request parameters after authentication. Authentication takes place using login.aspx, which uses Active Directory to check that the user logged into Windows has permission to view the website. Login.aspx finishes, dumping the user onto ASPXTOASP.ASP, which immediately crashes because the parameters it needs to iterate through have disappeared. When I write the query string at the top of the page it is blank. The login.aspx would redirect me to a different page if it failed. This leads me to believe that somehow, between those two programs, IISASP is dumping my parameters. Whats weird is that production works.

Negative 458 pIn my application, I want to check whether or not the server I am connecting to is trustable. Instead of using SSL, which would come with the cost of a certificate , I thought about creating my own identity check, where I would send a random string to the server at connection. The server would rsa encrypt the string with a hardcoded private key and send the result back. The client application would then decrypt the result with a hard coded public key it has only the public key, not the private one. If the string it sent and the string it decrypted matched, the servers identity would be proven and the tcp communication would just be encrypted with AES The AES key is transferred in rsa encrypted format after the server identity was proven.p  pQuestionsp  ol liIs this approach viable and if yes, where are the weaknesses besides me having to keep the private key secret, obviouslyli liWhat advantages would I gain by using SSL with a bought certificate in this circumstanceli liWould a selfsigned SSL certificate also be enough in this circumstance I plan to make the service publicly available.li ol

Negative 458 pI have been trying to figure out this problem all day, and really cant seem to get it. I have a function that I am calling a SQL Stored procedure in, using the SQL DataReader I am returning a table. Now the table has 8 columns but I am only using five per row in what I am trying to do.

Negative 458 pI am currently working on a project that converts a test from a standard word format to a format that is accepted by the new Saras program we are using.p  pI have been able to parse the file and gather the information that I want. Unfortunately there is a problem with the formatting, I only know how to parse and insert plain text. p  pA few options I have found so far include using the .Copy method and then using the .Paste method on the cell. I am using a class to hold the data intermittently so that if another parsing algorithm needs to be used for the next persons standard format, then the data will still be able to be put into the excel document the same way and the developer only needs to worry about parsing the new format.p  pNOTE If there is a way to paste this into a format like a stand alone cell and then set the cell or cell value to it, that would be great.p  pAnother option that I have found is using the interop.word.range.formattedtext property. This would work well if I was going to go from one word document to another, but I need to somehow get this formatted text over to an excel cell.p  pMy current thought process would be to take the text and put it into a RTF object. Later I would take it and put it into excel by inserting the RTF.text into the cell and use the RTF.format to format each character. This seems like more work than I should have to do.p  pPlease let me know what you all come up withp  pHere is some codep  pSTORAGEp  precodeclass Question      public string text     private Listltstringgt responses      public Questionstring txt, Listltstringgt r              text  txt         responses  r          public Listltstringgt getResponses  return responses   codepre  pPARSINGp  precodeif p lt MAX ampamp docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.ListFormat.ListValue  0       question main line     qTxt  docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.Text.ToString     p      question pos responses NOTE THIS WILL BE USED TO DO MULTIPLE CHOICE LATER     for  p lt MAX ampamp docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.ListFormat.ListValue  0 p              tmp  docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.Text.ToString         if tmp  null ampamp tmp  r             qTxt   rn   docs.Paragraphs[p].Range.Text.ToString       codepre  pSET THE VALUEp  precodeforeach Question question in questionList      ...

Negative 458 pi am working on an asp.net web application, where tasks are assigned to users, we set standard time to every task, in that standard time period the user has to finish the task, there are two buttons on the page, proceed and save, when a user clicks on proceed button, the time is saved in database as starttime, and when the user clicks on save button, the time is saved in database as endtime. this way we are capturing the time period within which the user is completing the task.p  pthe standard time is set on an average time study basis, not every time the task takes the same amount of time.p  poften users can complete the task in very less time than the standard time, in this case the users are proceeding the task and even after completing the task, instead of saving it, they lock the system and go for tea breaks and after coming from break, they save the task.p  pi want to save some information on the web page when they lock the pc even when the browser is minimized.p  pi tried implementing applet using jintellitype library but its not capturing the key combinations that are used by windows os.p  pi also tried using Silverlight but there is no such support as in winforms application in Silverlight, i have to create a com component or something that interacts with system32 or some native api. it doesnt seem easy for me, i would like to know if there is such library for Silverlight.p  pit should be browser independent, i havent tried ActiveX, but i think it can be done using ActiveX, but i dont want to use ActiveX as it runs only on IE.p  pi want to know all the possible solutions to achieve this.p  pthanks in advance.p

System.FormatException String was not recognized as a valid DateTime.p blockquote  pThe format is correct yyyyMMdd the source value was 20150916. It is blowing my mind and I cannot figure out why this error happened. As well once the first error occurs all following transactions to the service are broken as well until Application Pool on the server is reset. Once the app pool is reset everything is working even for the transaction that said it was broke.I dont know if it is a bug with DateTime.PraseExact or Automapper any help would be great since Im loosing my mind with it.p  h2UPDATEh2  pAfter more investigation it was found that there was a high memory usage on the server and high CPU usage on the server hour before the issue happened. One other thing was that the application pool restarted it self at exactly the same time the error occurred... Is that coincidental Could Application pool resetting itself cause these types of errors p
Negative 458 pIm building a simple website and I would like to be able to easily plug in modules such as News and Events into it so I can reuse those in the future. After a bit of digging around I found that the best way to do this is MEF. Using a hrefhttpkennytordeur.blogspot.in201208mefinaspnetmvc4andwebapi.html relnofollowKenny Tordeurs walkthrougha I got the site in a semiworking state. I then made a few changes and extensions based on a hrefhttpblog.longle.net20120928iocdependencyinjectionmanageextensiblityframeworkmefservicelocatorinnet4mvc4webapiidependencyresolverwithclosedclassesegtwilioapis relnofollowLong Les Bloga. Still no joy. my current problem is that my MefDependencyResolver is supposed to provide an instance of System.Web.Http.Hosting.IHostBufferPolicySelector but as the only thing its trying to do is GetExports on the CompositionContainer, and an implementation of this interface hasnt been exported, this is not really working at all.p  pI now have the feeling that I got the wrong idea entirely. p  pMy website is built using ASP.Net MVC 5 and its reasonably simple at this point. My NewsModule, that Im trying to plug in using MEF is also in MVC 5 and its using WebAPI 2 for a set of AngularJS requests e.g. getting the news.p  pTo make things worse, the modules architecture is based on a hrefhttpchsakell.com20150215aspnetmvcsolutionarchitecturebestpractices relnofollowthis bloga  which I found very useful but it now means that the API controllers in the module have dependencies that need to be injected somehow. p  pSo, a bit of code My strongGlobal.asaxstrong looks like thisp  precodeprotected void ApplicationStart              AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas

Negative 458 pSo, Im using a simple loginscript for a few pages, using sessions to identify the user, by putting the users name in a SESSION variable and then checking if the variable is set on each page. This worked fine when I ran the script locally through a WAMPserver  but when I uploaded it to a webhotel I ran into a weird issue.p  pThe loginscript, which sets the SESSION variable if the username and password matches up with information from a MySQLdatabase, somehow wont start the session. I have sessionstart at the top of every page, including the loginscript, so I dont understand why it wont start.p  pNow, I found a script on here that is used to check for sessionsupportp  precode     ltphp        Start Session       sessionstart        Show banner       echo ltbgtSession Support Checkerltbgtlthr gt        Check if the page has been reloaded      ifissetGET[reload] OR GET[reload]  true            Set the message          SESSION[MESSAGE]  Session support enabledltbr gt          Give user link to check         echo lta hrefreloadtruegtClick HEREltagt to check for PHP Session Support.ltbr gt                 else             Check if the message has been carried on in the reload            ifissetSESSION[MESSAGE]              echo SESSION[MESSAGE]                        else               echo Sorry, it appears session support is not enabled, or you PHP version is to old. lta hrefreloadfalsegtClick HEREltagt to go back.ltbr gt                         gt codepre  pThe really weird thing is that this script tells me that sessionsupport is enabled  and after running it, it suddenly works across all the pages. So I have to run this script in its own file every time I access the site, because the loginscript wont set the SESSION variable without running this script first.p  pJUST TO MAKE SURE I am NOT asking how to check if sessionsupport is enabled or not the issue is why sessions are not enabled untill AFTER I run the script above.p  pWhy is this happening, and how do I fix itp
