Positive 1634 pI have a site where the permalinks are already setup and working fine in the format a hrefhttpdomainpostname relnofollowhttpdomainpostnamea, I want to move them to a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea. Everything is done in the IIS rewrite module. I am assuming I need to first make a redirect rule from a hrefhttpdomainpostname relnofollowhttpdomainpostnamea to a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea and then tweak the permalink rewrite rule to make it work with the new a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea format although I am not sure if that is needed if I update the permalink settings in wordpress to a custom format that has the blog in the path. The first problem I am having is that the redirect is not working correctly, it redirects but doesnt put the blog in front of the postname like I am expecting. Here are the rules in the web.configp  precode        ltrule namewordpress stopProcessingtruegt             ltmatch urlblog negatetrue gt                 ltconditionsgt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsFile negatetruegt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsDirectory negatetruegt                 ltconditionsgt             ltaction typeRedirect urlblogR1 redirectTypePermanent gt         ltrulegt         ltrule namewordpress2 patternSyntaxWildcardgt             ltmatch urlgt                 ltconditionsgt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsFile negatetruegt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsDirectory negatetruegt                 ltconditionsgt             ltaction typeRewrite urlindex.phpgt         ltrulegt codepre  pAlso, if I need to tweak the second rule I am not sure what needs to change to make it continue to work or if I just need to update the permalink settings in wordpress. I am fairly new to wordpress and my knowledge of the rewrite module is enough to be dangerous. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have been looking for an example of this, but have had a difficult time finding one. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1634 pI work on a web application product which allows mnemonics i.e. an underscore below the character C, to allow a keyboard combination and the key C to trigger the Close button. p  ul liForms are created by different developers and they can each statically set mnemonics for buttons. li liForms can be nested, so it is not necessarily known at design time the exact mnemonics which will be required for one page. li liThere can be at most one mnemonic using any character on a page containing many forms.li liAnd heres the kicker, the forms must be able to be localised into any language, meaning that the C for close may not even appear in the... [insert language] word used for Close.li ul  pThe ideal solution would be some algorithm where developers didnt have to manually specify a mnemonic, instead they would be worked out at runtime, they would be localised, and they would be both convenient and consistent I did say the emidealem solution D.p  pSo I was wondering, are there any good strategies for achieving something anywhere near the ideal solutionp  phr p  pEDIT To clarify, p  ul liIm not talking about keyboard accelerators, such as CtrlS for save, which is hidden on a menu. The mnemonics are only used for actions which are presented on the screen, under button labels for example. Not hidden keyboard shortcuts that would change on localisation there are none anyway, we run in a web browser, so the only accelerators are those which are part of whichever browser is being used.li liThe problem with attempting to choose the mnemonics at design time is that the people responsible for developing the UI are not aware of the localisation, as it could be done months later. Also, the problem of using nested and modular forms means that even without the localisation, there could still be conflict.li ul  pSome of the ideas Ive batted around include having a global mnemonic registry which forms could use to apply for a certain mnemonic based on its localised label, the registry would then calculate which was the best use of available characters. Somehow it would have to maintain the state of that  such that the same form does not appear with different mnemonic sets over the course of the application use, it could possibly even be done statically and persisted. p  pSurely if I was looking to do something like that it would fit a more general algorithm  I just have no idea which one p

Negative 1634 pI am building a Java Swing application that needs to support both an embedded browser and ActiveX. The easy way to do this seemed to be to use stronga hrefhttpsjdic.dev.java.netdocumentationincubatorJDICplusindex.html relnofollowJDICplusastrong, which just embeds IE in your application. That would have covered both requirements.p  pI also need to overlay some buttons on top of this browser view so the user can navigate between views. To do that, I have a a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbookstutorialuiswingcomponentslayeredpane.html relnofollowJLayeredPanea to which I add views, and at a higher layer, buttons. This works in my pure Java views. However, on my Internet view, the Internet draws on top of the buttons. In other words, it doesnt seem to respect the JLayeredPane. Im guessing this is because it is a native component and not a Java component.p  pTo be sure, I put the Internet pane into a a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbookstutorialuiswingcomponentsinternalframe.html relnofollowJInternalFramea, and the buttons in the other, and put both of the internal frames into a JDesktopPane. When I drag the button frame on top of the Internet frame, the Internet frame jumps to the foreground and covers the other frame. Its as if the embedded IE steals the focus and puts itself in the forefront of my other windows.p  pMy question is this is there any way to draw Java components on top of these WindowsIE components reliably Or, am I not going to get anywhere mixing Java with IE Are there other options to meeting my requirement of an embedded browser and ActiveX support which technically, could be a different viewin other words, I could have an Internet view and another view that just supports ActiveX. Im open to suggestions. I have looked at other free browser components for Java, and as everyone will tell you, its discouraging.p
Negative 1634 pI think Im beginning to be confused with the job of a controller in MVC.p  pI have a service that exposes five functionsp  ul lilist packages in queueli liget packageli lidelete packageli liaccept packageli lideny packageli ul  pMy ASP.NET MVC controller depends on this service, and can generally execute a service call on an Action.  Im happy so far.p  pThe second part is then building the ViewModel result.  If I do this inside of the controller, the controller now has an exploding dependency list  each action added increases the dependencies in order to build the view model, and these are all inherited by the controller.  I dont like this very much.  Im building this controller that depends on N different view model builders, but only using one of them per request.p  pSo I was thinking of pulling all of this out and applying action filters specific to each view model.  I havent done this yet, but it seems okay.p  pThe question this is raising for me is what is the responsibility of the controller  If I end up pulling the view model building into filters, my controller is doing little more than having a route execute a service call and providing a filter plugin.  If I instead leave my controller responsible for building each view model, it becomes a mess.p  pIt seems like I almost want to instantiate an action per request, not a controller, and Im just abusing filters to get at thatp

Eventually, I would like to tap into WFs tracking and possibly persistance facilities.

Negative 1634 pI am using a 3rd party annotation processor for generating metadata code .java files from the annotated classes in my project. I have successfully configured the processor through Eclipse Properties  Java Compiler  Annotation Processing and the code generation works fine code is automatically created and generated. Also, Eclipse successfully autocompletes the generated classes and their fields, without any errors. Lets say that I have a class some.package.Foo and that the generated metadata class is some.package.Foo. By the help of autocompletion, I can get the following code in the Eclipse editor, without any errorsp  precodeimport some.package.Foo ... public class Test    void test      Foo.someField  null  try to access a field from the generated class Foo     codepre  pHowever, as soon as I actually build the project or just save the file since Build automatically is enabled, I get the error which tells that some.package.Foo cannot be resolved. It seems like Eclipse is generating and compiling the some.package.Foo at the same time, or more likely.p  pI found two temporary solutions which are practically hindering the use of the annotation processor in the first placep  ol liBefore each build of that generated classes, right click on every generated file go to Properties and uncheck the Derived tick. After that, I do the cleanup of the project and the imports are fine  there are no more errors. However, if I do the cleanup one more time, the errors again show up, because the generation of the files causes the Derived tick to be checked again automatically. So this is really annoying and timeconsuming.li liI also uncheck the Derived tick     from all those files, and this time     I uncheck the Derived tick from     the source folder and packages which     contain those files. Then I disable     the annotation processor, and then     do the cleanup. There are no more     import errors, even if I do another     cleanup, but there is no benefit of     using the annotation processor,     because if I was to change something     which would update the model, I need     to turn the annotation processor     back on, and repeat this tedious     procedure to turn it off, after it     has generated the new version of     those files.li ol  pIs this a bug in Eclipse If yes, is there a better workaround or quickfix than the two I have stated above If not, what should I try to solve the problemp  pI also tried rearranging the order of the libraries on the build path and it doesnt help.p

Negative 1634 pI have a buddy who runs a web app for people listing cars for sale. There are a few thousand clients who use it, and each client has hundreds and sometimes thousands of rows in the database some have been on for 5 years with hundreds of cars selling each month, and 10s of rows per sale comments, messages, etc. He has run this system in one SQL Server database in one physical server with like 20GB or RAM and a couple processors for the whole time, with no problems. Is this some sort of miraclep  pJust like most programmers, Im no DBA and just get by, thanks to ORMs, etc. Everywhere I look, people talk about having the need to shard or get a separate database server for big users of a web app. Why is this Is it really that inefficient to have a large DB with lots or rows Should I plan to use Cassandra or something, or can I rely on scaling up well with PostgreSQLp

Negative 1634 pMost functions are easy to name.  Generally, a function name is based on what it does or the type of result it produces.  p  pIn the case of a generator function, however, the result could be a iterable over some other type.p  precodedef sometype iterable      for x in iterable         yield sometransformation x  codepre  pThe codesometypecode name feels misleading, since the function doesnt return an object of the named type.  Its really an iterable over codesometypecode.p  pA name like codeitersometypecode or codegensometypecode feels a bit too much like a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHungariannotationHungarian Notationa.

These are typical examples, some of which are available in a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibraryitertools.htmlitertoolsa.

I was also hoping not to have to study a giant CMS to see what makes it a CMS .  After maybe a basic understanding I would know what I was looking for.p  pedit  heres why I ask about code.  Whenever I have looked at a CMS, and maybe they arent all the same, I saw that to develop a module you always had to inherit from certain classes and had some necessary code.  I didnt know if there was some magic model that I just dont get that all cms makers understand.p  pedit  perhaps my question is more about being extendable or pluggable.  What would a minimum look like  Is it possible to show that herep  pedit  how about this  Is something a CMS if it is not extendable andor pluggablep

Negative 1634 pI am creating a small project that eventually will be used in my final year project next year.p  pSo right now I have created a small sensor using USB virtual a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCOM28hardwareinterface29 relnofollowCOM porta and returning a set a values from 0 to 100. I have a progress bar which basically goes up and down depending the return value from the sensor via the virtual COM port.p  pNow my problem lies here. When the sensor in pushed hard enough and a value of 100 is returned I want to sound a small blip this part is done and working. But I also want that when the values of the sensor range from 50 to round 95, a tone is generated and is output via the speakers.p  pThe tone should be continuous, so if the user presses the sensor, and lets say the value is 65, if the user does not remove pressure from the sensor, it should continue to output a flat tone. If the user presses a little harder and lets say a value of 75 is returned, I want to increase the tone frequency.p  pThe most important thing is that it is a continuous tone for values that come from the sensor that are from 50 to 95 where 50 will sound a low frequency and 95 will be output a higher frequency. This should be in real time.p  pThe code is all done via C and I would like to use a library for C. I never used a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDirectX relnofollowDirectXa and am not really willing to download a huge library if not really necessary.p  pI am willing to buy some small library or use an open source library as long as the price of the library is not more than 50 or in that range.p

Does anyone know how to send error messages to emMathematicaem from Cp  hr  h2UPDATEh2  pBased on the answers that have been given and another useful a hrefhttplibrary.wolfram.cominfocenterBooks3710 relnofollowdocumenta Chapter 8 I managed to make it work. The code isnt so pretty at the moment but this made me ask the following question. Is it possible to terminate a function earlier In a regular C program if I encounter an error I would print an error message and use the codeexitcode function. Can we do something similar If we use the codeexitcode function the link will be broken and we will have to reinstall the function. Take the functions codeMLGetPointcode and codeMLGetLinecode for example. If an error occurred here then there is no point on procedding doing the calculations in the main function codeLineDistancecode. We need to clear whatever error we have obtained, send a message to Mathematica specifying the error, quit for now and wait for the next call. p

Negative 1634 pIm using togglelist displays that I pieced together from posts on this site. Theyre working great but I wanted them to be able to save a cookie value.p  pIve figured out how to have a cookie work when youre targeting a single classitem such as if myCookie  value  do stuff to .myClass . The issue though is that Im using a set of lists that are affected by calling them out with this. So targeting them via a class value wont work since theyll target everything using that class.

Negative 1634 pIn a Spring web application I have several DAO and service layer beans. One service layer bean has annotated Async  Scheduled methods. These methods depend on other autowired beans.

My problem is that I cannot get a clean shutdown of the task pools to work. The tasks operate on the database and on the file system. When I stop the web application it takes some time until it is stopped. This indicates that the codewaitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdowncode property works. However, I get IllegalStateExceptions in the log indicating that some beans are already destroyed but some worker task threads are still executing and they fail because their dependencies are destroyed.p  pThere is a JIRA issue which might be relevant a hrefhttpsjira.springsource.orgbrowseSPR5387SPR5387 ap  pstrongMy question is Is there a way to tell Spring to initialize the task executorscheduler beans last or is there a way to tell Spring to destroy them firststrongp  pMy understanding is that destruction takes place in reversed init order. Therefore the bean inited last will be destroyed first. If the thread pool beans are destroyed first, all currently executing tasks would finish and could still access dependent beans.p  pI have also tried using the dependson attribute on the thread pools referring to my service bean which has the Async and Scheduled annotations. Seems like they are never executed then and I do not get context initialization errors. I assume the annotated service bean somehow needs these thread pools initialized first and if I use dependson I reverse the order and make them nonfunctional.p

Negative 1634 pWe are using Mnesia as a primary Database for a very large system. Mnesia Fragmented Tables have behaved so well over the testing period. System has got about 15 tables, each replicated across 2 sites nodes, and each table is highly fragmented. During the testing phase, which focused on availability, efficiency and load tests, we accepted the Mnesia with its many advantages of complex structures will do for us, given that all our applications running on top of the service are ErlangOTP apps. We are running Yaws 1.91 as the main WebServer.brbr For efficiently configuring Fragmented Tables, we used a number of references who have used mnesia in large systems br These are ba hrefhttpigorrs.blogspot.com201005mnesiaoneyearlater.htmlMnesia One Year Later Blogab, ba hrefhttpigorrs.blogspot.com201005mnesiaoneyearlaterpart2.htmlPart 2 of the Blogab, ba hrefhttpigorrs.blogspot.com201005mnesiaoneyearlaterpart3.htmlFollowed it even hereab, ba hrefhttpigorrs.blogspot.com200911consistenthashingformnesiafragments.htmlAbout Hashingab. These blog posts have helped us fine tune here and there to a better performance.p  pNow, the problem. Mnesia has table size limits, yes we agree. However, limits on number of fragments have not been mentioned anywhere. For performance reasons, and to cater for large data, about how many fragments would keep mnesia okay .p  pIn some of our tables, we have 64 fragments. with codendisconlycopiescode set to the number of nodes in the cluster so that each node has a copy per fragment. This has helped us solve issues of mnesia write failure if a given node is out of reach at an instant. Also in the blog above, he suggests that codethe number of fragments should be a power of 2code, this statement he says was investigated from the way mnesia does its hashing of records. We however need more explanation on this, and which power of two are being talked about here 2,4,16,32,64,128,...p  pThe system is intended to run on HP Proliant G6, containing Intel processors 2 processors, each 4 cores, 2.4 GHz speed each core, 8 MB Cache size, 20 GB RAM size, 1.5 Terabytes disk space. Now, 2 of these high power machines are in our disposal. System Database should be replicated across the two. Each server runs Solaris 10, 64 bit.p  pAt what number of fragments may mnesias performance start to degrade Is it okay if we increase the number of fragments from 64 to 128 for a given table how about 65536 fragments 2  16  How do we scale out our mnesia to make use of the Terabyte space by using fragmentation p  pPlease do provide the answers to the questions and you may provide advice on any other parameters that may enhance the System.p  pNOTE All tables that are to hold millions of records are created in codedisconlycopiescode type, so no RAM problems. The RAM will be enough for the few RAM Tables we run. Other DBMS like MySQL Cluster and CouchDB will also contain data and are using the same hardware with our Mnesia DBMS. MySQL Cluster is replicated across the two servers each holding two NDB Nodes, a MySQL server, the Management Node being on a different HOST.p

Negative 1634 pThe problem is that I need to store 1 integer every day adding new data with time stamp for lots of entities every day lets say 10s of million entities, but they could easily be 100 of million or even half a billion as the entities are growing in populationp  pThe entities are grouped in an hierarchy and I can filter using those.p  pNow I would like a quick way to calculate average of these millions of values over a time period and perhaps also only calculate average using filtered data. My gut instinct is that as this data grows potentially 20 millions row every day it will be very hard to guarantee performance. p  pCan you suggest an easy solution. Should I stick with MySQL or some other fancy NoSQL solution would be better. As it stands it is already painfully slow to just count all the entities perhaps MySQL needs tuningp  pstrongEditstrong So when values are retrieved, some values come as null which mean that nothing can be said about those values. So in a query which spans between Jan 1, 2000 and Jan 10, 2000. If 2 values are null, then for average calculation, 8 data points would be used and it would be divided by 8 for average calculation, so its not like dividing it by number of days. My concern is that even countem takes sem load of time. Perhaps its about tuning, but I would be interested in some thing which doesnt need tuning and works for this particular problem as wellp

Negative 1634 pIn order to debug sbcl internals, I tried tracing sbcl internal packages.p  pFor example I tried p  precodetrace SBIMPL codepre  pThis causes a control stack overflow.

The above code shows binding stack exhausted error.

Negative 1634 pIve been using Spring.NET declarative Transaction management for some time in a code base that uses IBatis in conjunction with the TxScopeTransactionManager. I just added Spring.NET NHibernate support to the project using OSIV pattern without issue.  NHibernate will be used for new features only, ADO.NETIBatis legacy data access code still needs to work as is. So I now have two distinct transaction managers in my context p  ol liSpring.Data.Core.TxScopeTransactionManager existing Tran Mgrli liSpring.Data.NHibernate.HibernateTransactionManager added for Nhibernate li ol  pHowever, it looks like Spring.NET only allows a single TransactionManager to be bound to the Transaction attribute because legacy service methods decorated with this attribute are now using HibernateTransactionManager instead of TxScopeTransactionManager to commit or rollback transactions. This is problematic since HibernateTransactionManager is not aware of any nonnHibernate read ADO.NET connections.p  pIs there a way to have [Transaction] use different Transaction Managers, perhaps in concert with the ObjectNameAutoProxyCreator to either includeexclude service classes based on namespacep  pIf not, is there a way to have a single transactionManager handle both NHibernate and IBatis transactions  p  pI tested this using HibernateTransactionManager to manage both Data Access strategies, but my IBatis transactions arent getting rolled back.  This is particularly odd, because I can see in SQL Profiler that both a strongBegin Transtrong and strongRollback Transtrong are being sent by HibernateTransactionManager, but the data still gets committed. p  pIf I use TxScopeTransactionManager, then my IBatis transactions rollback successfully but NHibernate writes to the DB are never flushed. p

Negative 1634 pI have an HTML5 app running on an Android tablet with several input fields using typenumber.  The numeric keypad pops up asexpected when these fields gain focus.p  pOne of these fields is collecting the customers social security number.  Our requirements say that the field must show the full SSN when focused and dots when blurred.  Ive implemented this with two SSN fields.  One is input typepassword, one is input typenumber and is hidden by default.  p  precodeltinput typepassword nameSSNPass idSSNPass value placeholderSSN gt ltinput typenumber nameSSN idSSN value maxlength9 classrequired number gt codepre  pI have jQuery that hides the password field when it gains focus and shows the number field.

The user has to click the nowvisible number field to make the numeric keypad pop up.  Even though Im calling focus on the SSN visible number field, the full alphanumeric keypad stays up.p  pId like some way to tell browser to switch to the numeric keypad.  Ive tried a couple things like reforcing focus using a brief setTimeout delay as well as triggerfocus on the field with no luck.  p  pIts not a showstopper of an issue, but it would be nice to only have the numeric keypad since it would speed up data entry a bit.p  pSuggestionsp

Negative 1634 pIm experiencing an intermittent crash in my Android application running on a Droid X 2.3.4, using Cordova 1.6.1. Ive created a sample project a hrefhttpbit.lyIWxTv7 relnofollowhttpbit.lyIWxTv7a that clearly demonstrates the error on the device, but only intermittently. Its happening frequently enough that if you run the sample and repeat picking a photo, after about 6 attempts you should see the crash. Also note that this functions correctly on iOS and other Android devices, so the fact that its intermittent emandem deviceOS specific has me puzzled.p  pDescription of expected functionality The sample allows the user to pick a photo from the library or camera and shows it in an image element on the page. The real application works differently, but this isolates the problem.p  pWhat the code is doing A click handler on a button is calling the navigator.camera.getPicture method with a FILEURI destination type. After a photo is picked, the system uses the resulting temporary URI to read the image data and copy it to a persistent location. This uses the readAsDataURL method on the FileReader object. When it works, it takes the result and saves it to a persistent location using the write method on the FileWriter object. When that completes, it returns the URI for the persistent location to the button click event handler, which sets the src attribute of an image element to the persistent URI. That part doesnt work, probably because Im not using it correctly, but its not relevant to the real app, so I didnt bother troubleshooting and dont need an answer to why that doesnt work.p  pThe crash Run the app, tap the Photo button in the footer. When the photo page loads, tap the Get from camera or Get from library button. Pick a photo and return to the app. If the process completes successfully, the image element will display a broken image icon. If the process didnt complete successfully, the UI will remain as is, or the application will crash.p  pMy analysis The application crashes intermittently when attempting to execute FileReader.readAsDataURL. Ive come to this conclusion because its emalwaysem the last log entry I see before it crashes. However, in the past Ive seen log entries from stuff thats executed successfully not show up in the console because of an error downstream, so Im not 100 sure thats the cause, just a hypothesis. The crash is intermittent, but I was able to reproduce pretty quickly, within 6 attempts. Sometimes it succeeds, but when it fails it appears to always do so when trying to execute readAsDataURL.p  pHas anyone else encountered errors or crashes attempting to read a local file this way What is up and how do I fix this Alternate solutions or workarounds emmustem give me access to the base 64 encoded image data. p

Negative 1634 pI have this datatable, actually a list of datatable codeListltDataTablegt lstDataSourcecode, now for each table in the list I know there are exactly 6 rows, monday to saturday, but there can be any number of columns well from 6 to 14 that is, the number of hours an employee is working per day So I know the limits of both rows and columns in each datatable. My point is how do I use this list of datatable to update rather insert all these values in read database table codeEmpWorkSchedulecode. What I know is total rows inserted would be codelstDataSource.Count  6code right Also, for any column that doesnt have values, some employee work 6 hrs, some 7 hrs etc...  other columns in that rows would be just set to null.

What I want is that for the columns, for which, there is no value in the datarow, should be left null in the database table, rest all values should be inserted.p  pAlso, using an adapted doesnt seems likely because its used with select, I am not selecting anything, I am inserting something.p

Negative 1634 pI created an ASP.NET MVC4 Web API service REST with a single GET action.  The action currently needs 11 input values, so rather than passing all of those values in the URL, I opted to encapsulate those values into a single class type and have it passed as ContentBody.  When I test in Fiddler, I specify the verb as GET, and enter the JSON text in the Request Body input box.  This works greatp  pThe problem is when I attempt to perform Load Testing in Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate.  I am able to specify the GET action and the JSON ContentBody just fine.  But when I run the Load test, VS reports exceptions of type ProtocolViolationException Cannot send a contentbody with this verbtype in the test results.  The test executes in 1ms so I suspect the exceptions are causing the test to immediately abort.  What can I do to avoid those exceptions  Id prefer to not change my API to use URL arguments just to workaround the test tooling.  If I should change the API for other reasons, let me know.  Thanksp

Negative 1634 pI have a web application based on apache. php, js and jquery. All works fine. p  pOn the client side there is a small library in JSjquery, offering some generic list handling methods. In the past I used callbacks to handle those few issues where those methods had to behave slightly different. That way I can reuse methods like list handling, dialog handling and stuff for different part of the application. However recently the number of callbacks I had to hand through when stepping into the library grew and I am trying a redesign p  pInstead of specifying all callbacks as function arguments I created a central catalog object in the library. Each module of the application registers its own variant of callbacks into that catalog upon initialization. At runtime the methods lookup the required callbacks in that catalog instead of expecting it specified in their list of arguments. This cleans up things quite a lot. p  pHowever I have one thing I still cannot get rid of I require a single argument I call it context, mode might be another term that is used by the methods to lookup the required callback in the catalog. This context has to be handed through to all methods. Certainly better than all sorts of different callbacks being specified everywhere, but I wonder if I can get rid of that last one to.  But where do I specify that context, if not as method argument  I am pretty new to JS and jquery, so I failed to find an approach for this. Apparently I dont want to use global vars, and to be frank I doubt that I can simply store a context in a single variable anyway, since because of all the event handlers and external influences methods might be called in different contexts at the same time, or at least interleaving. So I guess I need something closer to a function stack. Maybe I can simply push a context object to the stack and read that from within the layers of the library that need to know  The object would be removed when I leave the library again. Certainly other approaches exist too. p  pHere are so many experienced coders how certainly can give a newbie like a short hint, a starting point that leads to an idea, how to implement this. How is such thing usually done  p  hr  pI tried round a while, exploring the codearguments.callee.callercode hierarchy. I thought maybe I could set a prototype member inside a calling function, then, when execution steps further down I could simply traverse the call stack upwards until I find a caller holding such property and use that value as context.  However I also saw the ongoing discussions that reveal two things 1. codearguments.calleecode appears to be depreciated and 2. it appears to be really expensive. So that is a no go. p  pI also read about the Function.caller alternative which appears emnotem to be depreciated and much more efficient, however until now I failed to explore that trail...p  hr  pAs written currently passing the contextmode down simply works by specifying an additional argument in the function calls. It carries a unique string that is used as a key when consulting the catalog. So something like this not copied, but written as primitive example p  precodelt callbacks gt callbackinnertaskbasefunctionarg1,arg2    do something with args  callbackinnertaskspecfunctionarg1,arg2    do something with args   lt catalog gt Catalog.Callbackfunctioncontext,slot    some plausibility checks...   return Catalog[context][slot]  Catalog.base.slotcallbackinnertaskbase Catalog.spec.slotcallbackinnertaskspec  lt callee gt dosomethingfunctionarg1,arg2,context   ...    callback as taken from the catalog   Catalog.Callbackcallback,innertaskarg1,arg2   ...   lt caller gt initfunction...   ...   dosomethingthing1,thing2,base   dosomethingthing1,thing2,spec   ...  codepre

I found that codeptracecode wont trace threads started by the child process, but thats another thing needs to be dealed with later. Is that even possible to check the child process from a different theradp  pThe other strange thing is that in my real application I do basically the same thing but from a much more complicated context classes, mutexes etc., and I get a different kind of error. Instead of codeptracecode returning with an error, codewaitcode doesnt even return for system calls on the child process and the child process doesnt even stop. On the other hand, codewaitcode works as expected when the child process exits.p

Ive found threadsguides a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11066068howtoprogramc11usingqt5herea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12113400compilingqt48xforvisualstudio2012herea, a hrefhttpwww.holoborodko.compavel20110201howtocompileqt47withvisualstudio2010comment7546herea, a hrefhttpqtproject.orgwikiBuildingQt5fromGitb50aae10a392d80cb2253ce34e686ae3herea and a hrefhttpduganchen.cabuilding64bitqtappsonwindowsherea, and none of them work or apply, though I note the second of these let me build Qt 4.8.3 with C11 support but 32bit.  The third one looks more complicated than it should be and also involves building with VS 2010, which seems like part of the problem, so I havent tried it.  I have also wasted a lot of time trying to build previous versions with different compilers, like mingw and clang, so Im pretty sure that cl is what I need to use.p  pBasically, Ive gotten to the point where I can build Qt4.8.3 and execute 64bit apps from within QtCreator 2.6.1, but I cant get full C11 support.  It finds only cl from VS 10.0 which has only very limited C11 support.  Figuring out how to get it to use cl from VS 11.0 would be one solution to my problem.  But when I try p  blockquote   pQMAKECXX  CProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio   11.0VCbinclp blockquote  pthe build fails with a codejomcode Error 2, and if I select the option for building with codenmakecode I get a similar error.p  pQt 5 should have full C11 support.  But when I try to build it myself from source, it fails.  The reason for this seems to be that despite running configuremake from the VS2012 x64 Cross Tools command prompt, specifying codeplatform win322012code in the configure step, and specifying codeQMAKECOMPILERDEFINES   MSCVER1700 WIN32code as perbr    a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12113400compilingqt48xforvisualstudio2012this guidea, in both the win32msvc2010 and win32msvc2012 mkspecs, it still builds with the cl from VS 2010 and that is causing some kind of conflict.

Negative 1634 pI have a UISwitch which is used to turn on or turn off a sound. The state is saved using NSUserDefaults. Works great. But if the app is started from the very first beginning after installing it, the BOOL value is 0 and the switch is OFF. Because no value has been saved earlier. So default is OFF and you are able to turn it ON and next time it is still ON.p  pI would like it the other way round, so when installing the app the switch is ON by default and you are able to turn it OFF.p  pHow do I solve thatp

Negative 1634 pIve been thinking of how machine code is specific to architecture and how Javascript works in nearlyevery browser. Ive been working on a project that has to do some serious calculations and it is Javascript based and takes a full minute to finish the calculating. It makes me long for the speed of C. But the whole reason the project is in Javascript is for simplicity and portability.p  pWhich gave me the idea, what if there was a language similar to Javascript that was just as portable and ran as an executable file on every architecture Most people would point to Java, but Im thinking something with less overhead and handled by the OS. Not byte code but native machine code.p  pDid a bit of researching and thinking to come to the impossibility of this task. How would you make an executable file as small as the normal C written application for a specific architecture that works on every architecture with the same speed as if it were natively compiled in C for that architecturep  pWhich comes to my next idea. Native machine code is specific to architecture, each architecture has certain special features and sometimes handles the same task differently. Also certain optimizations are specific per architecture. What if there was a Universal Machine Code When the OS loads the instructions into ram, it automagically converts the instructions to adapt to the architecture. Or perhaps crazier idea the CPU could contain the ability to receive the universal machine code and automatically adapts the universal machine code into its native machine codep  pThe Universal Machine Code specification would have to be generic enough to cover the normal Machine Code functions.p  pOf course if the Universal Machine Code did work, people would probably want a universal executable format thats handled by all OSes. That way the executable need not change across OSes. Which leads to frameworks that need to be made specifically to be universal across machines. And more nitty gritty would be OS specific features, and the ability for input and output which is going beyond what I know.p  pUniversal Machine Code compiled executablep  pProsp  ul liNearly same size as a native compiled executableli liNearly if not the same performance of a native compiled executableli ul  pConsp  ul liSlightlyhopefully nonexistantly slower in loading as it converts the universal machine code to native machine code when loading the executable in ramli ul  pIs it feasiblep  pEditp  pI have used Java, made a game in it. Its not as universal as Id like, nor as friendly.  It is its own programming language, maintained by Oracle. Proprietary and a bit too massive. Requires installation on some machines.p  pAnd to be more specific Im not talking about having a new programming language. Im talking about having a new machine code language that holds enough extra information that when executed, a very thin process of translating it to the architectures machine code happens. That way C compilers can just compile their executables into the universal machine code and the executables could run everywhere.p
Negative 1634 pFollowing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14658230my previous questiona, let me be more precise and less obfuscative about what exactly I want. I wrote a chemical package, where I made a decision that the names of all the chemicals and reactions will be capitalized, such as ATP, Adenosine, DeoxyCytidine etc. That allowed me to write egp  precodeATP  ChemicalSpecies.new initialconcentration 225.0      in micromolars GDP  ChemicalSpecies.new initialconcentration 75.0       in micromolars codepre  pNow if ATP is used to phosphorylate GDP, using enzyme NDPK with catalytic constantp  precodeNDPKconstant  0.6 codepre  p, this I want to be written asp  precodeChemicalReaction.new name ATPGDPphosphateexchange,                      rate lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  codepre  pI could just writep  precodeChemicalReaction.new name ATPGDPphosphateexchange,                      reactants [ ATP, GDP ],                      rate lambda  reactant1, reactant2 reactant1  reactant2  NDPKconstant  codepre  pBut it seems too wet to me. See how codereactant1code, codereactant2code repeqt twice, while codeATPcode, codeGDPcode being in mind. The easy solution would bep  precodeChemicalReaction.new name ATPGDPphosphateexchange,                      rate lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  codepre  pAnd codeinstanceevalcode the ratefinding block in the context that defines codeATPcode and codeGDPcode as concentrations of codeATPcode, codeGDPcode. This is very very close, but not emexactlyem the thing I want, and that pisses the heaven out of me. I could even use codeRubyVMcode to find, which chemicals are used inside the block, consider eg.p  precoderequire ap  awesomeprint, like prettyprint but fancier, install if you dont have ap RubyVMInstructionSequence.disassemble lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  .split n  gt [ 0]  disasm ltRubyVMInstructionSequenceblock in irbbindingirbgt,     [ 1]  catch table,     [ 2]  catch type redo   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0000,     [ 3]  catch type next   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0027,     [ 4] ,     [ 5] 0000 trace            1                                                 22,     [ 6] 0002 putself          ,     [ 7] 0003 send             ATP, 0, nil, 24, ltic0gt,     [ 8] 0009 putself          ,     [ 9] 0010 send             GDP, 0, nil, 24, ltic1gt,     [10] 0016 optmult         ltic5gt,     [11] 0018 getinlinecache   25, ltic3gt,     [12] 0021 getconstant      NDPKconstant,     [13] 0023 setinlinecache   ltic3gt,     [14] 0025 optmult         ltic6gt,     [15] 0027 leave codepre  pBy parsing this, one learns what names are inside codeATPcode and codeGDPcode. But like I said, out of stubbornness, I find codeATPcode, codeGDPcode ugly. I want to say just codeATPcode, codeGDPcode, or perhaps code[ATP]code, code[GDP]code, because chemists use brackets for concentrations. I know that this is what Yusuke Endoh calls constrained coding. My question is, can either of these two desirable syntaxes be beaten For example, having a closure codelambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant code, disassembling it givesp  precodeap RubyVMInstructionSequence.disassemble lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  .split n  gt [ 0]  disasm ltRubyVMInstructionSequenceblock in irbbindingirbgt,     [ 1]  catch table,     [ 2]  catch type redo   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0000,     [ 3]  catch type next   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0027,     [ 4] ,     [ 5] 0000 trace            1                                                 23,     [ 6] 0002 getinlinecache   9, ltic0gt,     [ 7] 0005 getconstant      ATP,     [ 8] 0007 setinlinecache   ltic0gt,     [ 9] 0009 getinlinecache   16, ltic1gt,     [10] 0012 getconstant      GDP,     [11] 0014 setinlinecache   ltic1gt,     [12] 0016 optmult         ltic5gt,     [13] 0018 getinlinecache   25, ltic3gt,     [14] 0021 getconstant      NDPKconstant,     [15] 0023 setinlinecache   ltic3gt,     [16] 0025 optmult         ltic6gt,     [17] 0027 leave  codepre  pOne sees that codegetconstantcode appeared at lines 7, 10 for codeATPcode, codeGDPcode. Outside the block, codeATPcode and codeGDPcode constants contain codeChemicalSpeciescode instances, but inside the block, I want them to refer to ATP and GDP emconcentrationsem. I didnt find any way to evaluate the block in an evironment where the constants themselves have different meanings that is, unless I want to temporarily rewrite the constants at runtime using dirty tricks, which is what I dont want. What I crave for is to be able to replace this RubyVM code codegetconstant ATPcode instruction by eg. codesend  ATP, 0, nil, 24, ltic0gtcode, and then eg. codeinstanceevalcode this closure in an evironment where codeATPcode means codeATP.concentrationcode... I know Im asking difficult questions, sorry again...p  pAs for the second option code[ATP]code, code[GDP]code, that one would require activating some sort of new array creation hook inside the block only, so that if there is just one element, that is a codeChemicalSpeciescode, its concentration would be returned instead of an array object. I think this is equally difficult, if not impossible task.p

Negative 1634 pIm trying to figure out how I can have a class listen to another. So this is the idea.p  pI have a codeMainFramecode class, which is simply a container class, JFrame container, that takes an argument of type JPanel. Basically I want this container class to be able to switch between frames depending on what my other class, codeFrameSwitchercode, will tell it to do. p  pThe other classes are codeFrameSwitcher, MainMenu and ScoreBoardscode.p  pThe idea is that, lets say codeMainMenucode, will contain 4 buttons, each one will listen, BUT will NOT change the frames. Rather it will somehow  and this is the part I need help with  send to the codeFrameSwitchercode what button was clicked, and this information will then be sent to codeMainFramecode to switch to the appropriate frames. p

Negative 1634 pI am currently testing a price comparison script which crawls the web for prices and uses php to dump the results into a MYSQL database.  Im using GoDaddy to host.p  pThe basic structure of the script looks something like thisp  precodefori  0 i lt 60 i      forj  0 j lt 25 j               CONNECT to mysqlserver             SELECT database             INSERT data into table                                         codepre  pSuch that by the end of the script, I have inserted approx 25601500 rows into my table The data is not a lot, its basically 5 varchar45 fieldsp  pI have about 20 different tables which Im populating. But as I run the script for each table, Im finding that while some tables manage to get to i60 and contain the complete set of data with no issues, other tables seem to be breaking early, they will get close but will terminate somewhere around i52 or i56 p  pMy theory is that this is being caused by some sort of queryhour limit which I am exceeding or some other mysql limit. I dont think it can be a simultaneous connection limit since I am closing the connection each time I insert a row of data.p  pWhich mysql system variables could be causing this behaviour How can I troubleshoot this e.g. is this there a way to see mysql error messagesp

Negative 1634 pWe have developed an iPhone application which communicates with SQL server database via asp.net hosted on a public server. We have completed all the development and we need to test this with live server data.p  pNow we understand that live server database is using dynamic ports and cannot be accessed from our asp.net script. Database administrator is against changing the dynamic ports as they are worried about the security threat. We tried asking them to change this by giving access to the  server where we host the asp.net web service but they are not willing to do this.p  pThe solution they are asking is to develop a windows service which would act as a middleware between their SQL server database and our web service. They are ready to open ports for running that windows service on their server.

Negative 1634 pWeve got a a hrefhttpwww.frogatto.com relnofollowfairly mature crossplatform game enginea which weve had running on OSX for several years now without a hitch we recently upgraded the game from SDL 1.2.15 to 2.0, and at some point in the conversion, I goofed something up and now we have a bizarre problem where the app launches just fine from the terminal, but when you launch the app from a doubleclick in the Finder, it just bounces once in the dock and just goes away.p  pWere baffled because insofar as I can tell, theres only a oneliner being printed in Console.app codeExited with code 255code naturally running from the terminal doesnt help here because we cant reproduce the problem there the app runs fine when launched in a terminal.p  pSo the only thing we can figure is its either something were goofing up in our main.cpp, or something weve hosed in how I set up the dylibsframeworks.  Its also possible that its something to do with the working directory not being set right, but to the best of my abilities, I believe were doing it right regardless of your current working directory the app attempts to forcibly set said directory to be in the Resources folder  this was necessary to get the game to launch, but I dont know if were doing it wrong.  This feels like a somewhat awkward fit for stackoverflow, for which I apologize, since its not a simple paste this code and ask whats wrong job.  I have two ways for you to reproduce it firstly we are an opensource project, and you can get our source code complete with a mac project file and all dependencies included in the repo, set up and readytogo exactly as Ive perhaps erroneously created them, a hrefhttpgithub.comanuraengineanura relnofollowat our github pagea.  The one change youll need to do is open a file at the root level, named codemasterconfig.cfgcode, and remove the codecode comments from it so the engine knows you want to launch a simple demo game shipped with the engine.p  pAlternately, I have a stripped down 15mb zipped a hrefhttpfrogatto.comdevbuildsFrogattoLaunchTestCase1.app.zip relnofollowbinary you can directly downloada and try to run, if thats sufficient to diagnose the problem.p  pAs said before, were opensource, so we welcome any pullrequests for fixesp

It seems that the only alternative is to dedicate x amount of bytes to each piece of data and then rewrite that block if i wanted to change it... the problem with this is that it would take up a lot more space than needed in just null bytes, and it would take longer to write... and that still would not solve how to remove data, as the file could never shrink in size...  i really need some help here...p  pIf i used prefixed blocks for each piece of data in the file, like 1 mb, then i wanted to enter data that was only code100kbcode, that entry would take 10x actual needed space, and the entry could never be changed to something more than 1mb of data, as it would overwrite more than ist dedicated block...  removing it would not be possible... hope this makes any sense...  i am not looking for alternatives, i am looking to write and change data in the middle of files, hehe...p  pUPDATE Yes, i would like to replace the old data, but if the new data extends more than the old data i would want the rest of the data to be pushed futher into the file...p  pconsider this 0000000HELLODATA00000000 the zeros represent empty space, nothing... now i would like to replace HELLO with SOMETHING, now since  something is larger than hello, simply writing in the starting point of hello would extend byond hello and start overwriting data... therefore i would like DATA to be pushed futher into the file, to make room for SOMETHING without overwriting DATA... hehep

So with this logic PMBIDs...p  precode249941 249942 249943 249966 codepre  pwould be removed.p  pSo how do I do this well in SQL seen as my column is stringp  pIve been writing queries such as...p  precodeDELETE FROM Containers WHERE Dept LIKE 1 OR Dept LIKE 11 OR Dept LIKE 23 OR Dept LIKE 31 codepre  pObviously this statement doesnt work as it catches departments like 15, and 16, so for example PMBIDp  precode249967 codepre  pwould be included when it strongshouldntstrong as its not explicitly a 1,11,23, or 31 or a combination of these.p  pIs this possible with a string column Can we use the delimiter somehow to improve the queryp  pIll stop now as risk of overcomplicating the query, please let me know if you need any further information.p  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 1634 pImagine programming something in Java or C. You have a file, which is about 5000 lines worth of pure code. Every time you type a single letter, and pause for a split second think Eclipse or Visual C, the IDE will show a bunch of errors throughout your file or maybe only the same line, depending on the editor.

Negative 1634 pSo here are the things I know. The java application is attached, there are two JPanels , one with a basic graph and one that is more detailed. These two graphs are hosted on an applet together. The applet reads a file with all the student survey data. This all hosted on an instance of Desire 2 Learn a hrefhttpwww.desire2learn.com relnofollowhttpwww.desire2learn.coma called courselink a hrefhttpscourselink.uoguelph.casharedloginlogin.html relnofollowhttpscourselink.uoguelph.casharedloginlogin.htmlap  pSo this all works. The aspect that doesnt is getting from courselink who is signed on so the appropriate graph can be shown. A guy that works on developing courselink gave me a php program that grabs that information and returns it in a JSON block.p  pThe php code is hosted on a different serve then the java app which is hosted on courselink. So here is what I have triedp  pfirst just grabbing what the page returned from javap  precodeString name  null     URL php  null     try          php  new URL httpcoles vs250.cs.uoguelph.cawhoamiindex.php      catch MalformedURLException e          e.printStackTrace          URLConnection yc  php.openConnection     BufferedReader in  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderyc.getInputStream     String inputLine      while inputLine  in.readLine  null          System.out.printlninputLine     in.close     return name  codepre  pThen I was going to parse out the string, parse out the users name and return it. When I run this on course link though I get a security error, and I dont really know anything about java security errors. here is the errorp  precodeException in thread AWTEventQueue2 java.security.AccessControlException  access denied java.net.SocketPermission  colesvs250.cs.uoguelph.ca80  connect,resolve codepre  pSo next I tried to use codeJQuerycode to call the php from the html page so then the string would be a variable on the right survey and then the java app could grab it. After some research this is what I put together. I do not know JQuery and am actually quite out of my element when it comes to this kind of programming altogether. The alerts are not showing and I dont know whats wrong. p  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtJava Examplelttitlegt         ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.5.2.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             document.readyfunction                  alertString from iframe   whoami.contents.findbody.html                 whoami                           function whoami                  .ajax                     type GET,                     data ,                     url httpcolesvs250.cs.uoguelph.cawhoamiindex.php,                     success functiondata                          alertwhoami complete   data                                                            ltscriptgt     ltheadgt      ltbodygt         ltpgt             ltiframe stylevisibility visible idwhoami srchttpcolesvs250.cs.uoguelph.cawhoamiindex.phpgtltiframegtampgtltpgt         ltpgt             ltapplet width800 height1000 codegraphRun.classgtltappletgt         ltpgt     ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  pAny and all help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated and if there is any more info I should get or forgot I will do my best.   p

Negative 1634 pA suggestion here would be deeply appreciated.p  pWe use Spring Security domain object security to lock down access to specific objects in our Grails application. We have extended permissions as well. We use normal PreAuthorize annotation to control access to the domain objects depending up the privileges assigned to a specific user.p  pIn this architecture, I want for one user to be able to invite a second user to join a group. To do this, the second user receives an invitation from the first user to join a group with specific privileges. The second user can choose to accept or reject the invitation.p  pGiven that the domain object belongs to the first user, not the second user, how could I grant access to the second user to the domain object with the privileges offeredp  pI have tried to hack a solution using PreAuthorizepermitAll on a service method just to see if that would work. While not ask secure as granting an object the privilege to set privileges to a domain object, it at least would get me going. But no joy, I continue to get accessDenied for class errors, presumably because the current user is the second user, not the domain object owner.p  pDo I need to work through the SpEL suggestion a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17789822grailscustomsecurityevaluatorherea I barely understand how the bean resolver works unfortunately.p  pEdit Even when I verify the invitation is valid at invocation Spring ACL throws an exception when the first ACE for the new user is attempted to be inserted.

Negative 1634 pI am trying to migrate DevExpress TdxDBGrid for Unicode applications and the lack of nonUnicode TStringList is the only obstacle for completing the migration. I have tried to use TAnsiStringList from JcLAnsiString from JediJcl open source project and while it works, it includes too many dependencies on JediJcl framework. Generally my plan is to use migrated TdxDBGrid for working with unicode data, but TAnsiStringList is required for internal actions  like storing bookmarks, selected rows and so on. p  pIs the more lightweight nonUnicode TStringList with less dependenciesp
Negative 1634 pI am missing something about sharedweak pointersp  pWhen a codesharedptrcode is constructed using codemakesharedcode, only one memory allocation is used to allocate memory for control block and object itself. What happens when last codesharedptrcode is destroyed but there are codeweakptrcodes left At this point managed object has to be deallocated. But if memory allocated by codemakesharedcode gets deallocated, that would make weak pointers invalid, since same deallocation would destroy control block.p

Negative 1634 pI want to display a very long list elements, divided into approximately 580 sections. When I open the UITableViewController it takes a second or two on a iPhone 5 to load the controller. From instrumenting the code I learned that it is the string operations I do for every sections title that delays the display of the table. If returning a constant string it performs way faster.p  ul liQuestion 1 Why does the UITableView construct all section headers in advance when on the other hand it tries to reduce load by rendering cells lazilyli liQuestion 2 What can I do about it Is there a way to tell the UITableView not to do so or would you store the titles in Core Data themselves I display dates as section titles, so it may not be wise to store them as strings as they depend on the location, daylight saving time, language, etc.li ul

Contributing area, as suggested by its name, is a product sum of of all area from upstream node.p  pHere is the code of that two functions, p  precodefor curnode  nodIter.FirstP nodIter.IsActive     curnode  nodIter.NextP   iterating thru a linkedlist of pointers to active stream nodes IsActive returns a  bool value    CalcDRArea curnode, curnodegtgetVArea  calls another function and pass a pointer to current node  as well as a value of its VArea  codepre  hr  precodevoid CalcDRArea NodeClass curnode, double addedArea      As long as the current node is neither a boundary nor nonvalid, add    addedArea to its total drainage area and advance to the next node downstream    while curnodegtReachBoundary  NonBoundary ampamp         curnodegtvalidNonvalid            curnodegtAddDrArea addedArea   AddDrArea is a simple inline function drarea value      curnode  curnodegtgetDownStreammNeighbor       getDownstrmNbr reruns a pointer to the downstream node      codepre  pHere is a simple illustration of nodes and their flowing direction  p  precodeA     B     C     D                   E     F     G     H                   I     Q     K     L                 M     N     O     P letters are stream nodes and slashes are their flowing directions codepre  pMy plan is to use OpenMP to implement multithreading at the beginning of first function, the emfor loopem.

Negative 1634 pI have a code which uses JPA annotations to generate DB primary key.A DB sequence is used to generate the PK.Am using Oracle DBp  precode        Id         Columnname  recid, scale  0         GeneratedValuegenerator  RecIdSequence, strategy  GenerationType.SEQUENCE         SequenceGeneratorname  RecIdSequence, sequenceName  PRECIDSEQUENCE         public Long getRecordId              return outboundPackageRecordId          codepre  pNow my understanding of this is sequence id returned by DB sequencer is used as recid. IS this correctp  pDOC saysp  precodeThe Sequence Strategy The sequence strategy consists of two parts  defining a named sequence and using the named sequence in one or more fields in one or more classes. The SequenceGenerator annotation is used to define a sequence and accepts a name, an initial value the default is 1 and an allocation size the default is 50. A sequence is global to the application and can be used by one or more fields in one or more classes. The SEQUENCE strategy is used in the GeneratedValue annotation to attach the given field to the previously defined named sequence  Entity  Define a sequence  might also be in another class SequenceGeneratornameseq, initialValue1, allocationSize100 public class EntityWithSequenceId       Use the sequence that is defined above     GeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.SEQUENCE, generatorseq     Id long id  Unlike AUTO and IDENTITY, the SEQUENCE strategy generates an automatic value as soon as a new entity object is persisted i.e. before commit. This may be useful when the primary key value is needed earlier. To minimize round trips to the database server, IDs are allocated in groups. The number of IDs in each allocation is specified by the allocationSize attribute. It is possible that some of the IDs in a given allocation will not be used. Therefore, this strategy does not guarantee there will be no gaps in sequence values. codepre

Negative 1634 pIn my project Im using the DateTimeOffset datatype for parameters. I realised the offset is always 0. But I need the local time on serverside. To fix this I send the timezoneoffset in http header and will read this on creating of the DateTimeOffset parameter. Therefore I created a ModelBinder to convert the request into a DateTimeOffset and get the timezoneoffset from the header. That works, but if any action has a complex object with a DateTimeOffset property sending via http POST to web api in JSON format, so the modelbinder wasnt executed and the offset in the DateTimeOffset property is 0.

But, as I go through the documentation for codesnmpgtgetbulkrequestcode, I find a parameter called  codemaxrepetitionscode. It is not clear to me from the documentation what this parameter does.p  pI am trying to figure out what effect the codemaxrepetitionscode parameter has when used with the codegetbulkrequestcode call method. I have gone through the documentation in a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgdtownNetSNMPv6.0.1libNetSNMP.pmgetbulkrequest2829sendaSNMPgetbulkrequesttotheremoteagent relnofollowgetbulkrequest  send a SNMP getbulkrequest to the remote agenta and found thisp  precoderesult  sessiongtgetbulkrequest                           [callback        gt sub ,]      nonblocking                           [delay           gt seconds,]    nonblocking                            [contextengineid gt engineid,]  v3                            [contextname     gt name,]       v3                           [nonrepeaters    gt nonreps,]                           [maxrepetitions  gt maxreps,]                           varbindlist      gt oids,                         codepre  pThe default value for codegetbulkrequest maxrepetitionscode is 0.

Negative 1634 pI have a solution in VS2012 with a SharePoint 2013 sandboxed project. I have created some custom workflows in 2013.p  pWhat I really need to do is to have an approval workflow to publish content, and send out an email when a new document is approved.p  pMy first thought was to use the OOB approval 2010 workflow and use an event receiver on the list. When an item becomes approved, I would send out an email, but Im unable to send emails programmatically in SharePoint online.p  pMy second thought was to recreate the workflow in 2013, since I know I can send emails out that way, but it looks like the activities related to content approval were removed for 2013 workflows. I can try and do the approvals via rest calls, but my concern was that my workflow will fire every time the item in the list changes even if its not a publish, so I will have to check in the workflow if the item is being published or not. This will cause the workflow history for the items to become pretty useless as it will be filled with mostly white noise. Also, as far as I can tell, the checkbox when you create an association for Start this workflow to approve publishing a major version of an item. does not apply to 2013 workflows.p  pI believe my best answer at this time would be to create a custom 2010 workflow, but I dont see how I can do that from inside VS2012. Can anyone help me or maybe suggestion another alternative to achieving my goalp

Negative 1634 pI have read other questions about circular references on here but I cant find the answer to my question.p  pI have three class libraries Authentication, EmailService and ExceptionService.p  pAuthentication controls user login to various applications, EmailService sends emails, the ExceptionService logs errorsexceptions to a database.p  pAt the moment Authentication references the EmailService and the ExceptionService, to use their functionality, and this works.

In theory this could mean that the ExcpetionService would then call back to the EmailService to send the reporting email, which may trigger the same error, so I would have to write a method that was used by the EmailService only which did not send the email, only logged it.pli lipThe ExceptionService should still reference the EmailService.pli lipThe Authentication class library should also still use both of the other services.pli ul  pThis all sounds very complicated and circular, which is why I think it might not be a good thing to do. But what should I do insteadp  pI have tried referencing the ExceptionService in the EmailService, but it then will not compile when I create a private ExceptionService object and try to use it.p  pI suppose what I really want is for any of my applications to reference the EmailService and ExceptionService, but for them to also reference each other.p  pThe only way of solving this that I have found so far is to forget about reporting exceptions in the EmailService.p  pMany thanks for your help p

Negative 1634 pFirst a little bit of contextp  pIm writing an academical article on pandocyaml  a hrefhttpleoeditor.com relnofollowLeo Editora. With this combination I can write in a really organic way. Leo Editor tree is used to organize the writing in a nonlinear fashion, so I can see the main topics of the writing with nested deep on them, choose what to focus on in the next writing session and put some parts of the writing on holding and so on. Yaml nodes in the tree store the bibligraphical references and a custom made script node is used to convert that Leo tree to pandocs markdown  and that file is used to create the pdf.p  pToday I wrote something like thisp  precodeSee the image [hsworldmap]    type image  file ..Imageneshackerspacesmapa2014ene.png  scale 50  alias hsworldmap  caption       Mapa mundial de los hackerspaces a enero 4 de 2014 registrados en     httphackerspaces.org.

So my question isp  ul liThere is any example of how to extract yaml blocks data in markdowns pandoc and using it to insert that data in a modified output preferably LaTeX and HTML I wouldnt matter to learn lua if its necessary, but would be better if that example is on python, just to focus on writing the article.li ul  pI think that this custom syntax could be a way to evolve pandoc sharing yaml blocks and custom writers, at least is a good experiment about how this can be done.p

Negative 1634 pIm working on a 3D building app. The building is done on a 3D grid like a Rubiks Cube, and each cell of the grid is either a solid cube or a 45 degree slope. To illustrate, heres a picture of a chamfered cube I pulled off of google images p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIvTKI.jpg altenter image description herep  pIgnore the image to the right, the focus is the one on the left. Currently, in the building phase, I have each face of each cell drawn separately. When it comes to exporting it, though, Id like to simplify it. So in the above cube, Id like the updownleftrightbackfront faces to be composed of a single quad each two triangles, and the edges would be reduced from two quads to single quads.p  pWhat Ive been trying to do most recently is the followingp  pIterate through the shape layer by layer, from all directions, and for each layer figure out a good simplification remove overlapping edges to create single polygon, then split polygon to avoid holes, use ear clipping to triangulate.p  pIm emclearlyem over complicating things at least I hope I am. If Ive got a list of vertices, normals, and indices currently with lots of duplicate vertices, is there some tidy way to simplify The limitations are that indices cant be shared between faces because I need the normals pointing in different directions, but otherwise I dont mind if its not the fastest or most optimal solution, Id rather it be easy to implement and maintain.p  pEDIT Just to further clarify, Ive already performed hidden face removal, thats not an issue. And secondly, its of utmost importance that there is no degradation in quality, only simplification of the faces themselves I need to retain the sharp edges.p

Negative 1634 pI am facing an issue while using SQL Server Notifications. I am developing a web application in ASP.net where one of the page needs to be notified about new entries in one of the tables in a SQL Server database. I am using SQL Server Notification services along with Signal R to achieve this functionality.All seems to work fine with my web page getting updates about new data entries. p  pThe problem arises when the page using notification is refreshed. I find the no of notification for single entry in database go up by the number of refreshes. So if I refresh the page thrice, I get 3 notifications for one entry. I am bit concerned if this would be a burden on server when the no of connected users increases. Also if there is an error while processing the request to update the page with new entry, the user gets multiple error messages with same text. I tried debugging my code and found out that the on change event of codeSqlDependencycode object used is fired multiple time with different IDs every time. Below is brief overview of what my code is doing to use notifications p  ol lipI am using SQL Server 2012 and codeenablebrokercode is set for the database.pli lipIn codeglobal.asaxcode, I am using codeapplicationstartcode and codeapplicationstopcode events to start and stop codeSqlDependencycode.pli lipIn page code, I am setting a new codeSqlDependencycode object on page load using a command object to monitor the exact data field of the table. pli lipWhen codeonchangecode of codeSqlDependencycode object fires, I am notifying the UI using Signal R hub class. Then I remove the codeOnChangecode handler of the codeSqlDependencycode object, call for codeSqlDependency.Stopconnectionstringcode, set codeSqlDependencycode object to nothing, call for codeSqlDependency.Startconnectionstringcode and finally set up the codeSqlDependencycode object again using the command object for updated data. This whole set to nothingstopstartreset object is to continue monitoring the data for changes.pli ol  pThe above steps work fine but when I refresh the page, those are repeated for the number of refreshes. I tried a lot of things by changing code and debugging but nothing seems to resolve the issue. Now I am wondering if it is some setting somewhere that I missed.p  pPlease help me resolve this issue. Also let me know if any other information such as environment, coding details etc are required.p  pRegards, Tanmayp

Negative 1634 pReally sorry if this sounds awfully noob but Ive been playing around Python for the past couple of days.p  pIve been trying to make a desktop client. Long story short, Ive manage to make it so it generates a URL for authorization. It goes like codehttpwww.samplesample.comauthorizeoauthtoken[bigassstringhere]ampoauthcallbackhttpsometokenrecievingurl.comcode p  pGoing to that URL, I get redirected to codehttpsometokenrecievingurl.comoauthtoken[anotherbigassstring]ampoauthverifier[yetanotherbigassstring]codep  pSo my question is is there a way to get the oauthtoken and oauthverifier value without having to manually copy and paste the URL for authorization Like is there a way for python to check the generated URL by itself, check the URL its redirected to, then slice out the oauthtoken and oauthverifier partp  pAgain, sorry if this sounds simple to someone out there. I wouldnt be sure since Im really new to this and Ive been looking all over SO for relevant questions with no luck. Or maybe Im just looking at the wrong links or terms. But yeah, any help would be appreciated.p  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pOkay so I continued playing around and I relaized I totally forgot a step here. The generated URL actually directs you to a page where Ill need to click whether to allow access or not. After clicking Allow, thats the only time I get redirected to codehttpsometokenrecievingurl.comoauthtoken[anotherbigassstring]ampoauthverifier[yetanotherbigassstring]code p  pSo I was wondering, how do I go on about extracting those strings from an open browserp

Negative 1634 pWhat Im trying to do is to create a circle, and then drop out all the integer points in that circle that are out of given bonds like area intersection of circle and some geometrical figure. The geometrical figure is represented as a list of codex,ycode tuples, so is the circle with additional codeOcode variable equal to its centre.

One of the borderline points of the circle is code5,11code, and theres a point in bounds equal to code5,10code. So points code5,11code and code5,10code should get removed from codecopycode. code5,10code does, but code5,11code doesnt. Whats more, the pair code5,10 5,11code dont even appear in the output, code5,10 5,10code does The inner loops continues with bound equal code5,10code, code5,11code is the only point omitted. code5,11code does appear in other outer loop iterations. Whats going on What can cause the loop to omit one of the pointsp  pA little background this code executes on a django server, the codeboundscode list is moderately big, it contains 1015 elements, and Im using python 2.7.

At this point I have a setup that does exactly what I want with the exception of the sbt main thread going crazy and eating 100 cpu.

Negative 1634 pIve run into an issue while trying to implement a filter control to filter results displayed after a retrieve using nhibernate.  Suppose I have an entity called Facility and this facility can be customized by the user and additional columns can be added to its structure Example, numberoffloors. When this customization occurs, the table structure in the database is changed new column is added of the appropriate type but obviously that column does not exist in the domain or mapping file. Instead, it is stored in a table like thisp  precodelthibernatemapping assemblyDatabases namespaceDomains xmlnsurnnhibernatemapping2.2gt   ltclass nameCsCustomColumn tableCSCUSTOMCOLUMN lazytruegt     ltid nameIdgt       ltcolumn nameid sqltypevarchar32 gt     ltidgt     ltproperty nameColumnNamegt       ltcolumn namecolumnname notnulltrue gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty nameColumnTitlegt       ltcolumn namecolumntitle notnulltrue gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty nameColumnWidthgt       ltcolumn namecolumnwidth gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty nameColumnPrecisiongt       ltcolumn namecolumnprecision gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty nameDefaultValuegt       ltcolumn namedefaultvalue gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty nameMinValuegt       ltcolumn nameminvalue gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty nameMaxValuegt       ltcolumn namemaxvalue gt     ltpropertygt     ltmanytoone inserttrue updatetrue lazyfalse nameCsRefTablegt       ltcolumn namecsreftableid notnulltrue sqltypevarchar32 gt     ltmanytoonegt     ltmanytoone inserttrue updatetrue lazyfalse nameCsRefDataTypegt       ltcolumn namecsrefdatatypeid notnulltrue sqltypevarchar32 gt     ltmanytoonegt   ltclassgt lthibernatemappinggt codepre  pThis table is then linked via FK to CSREFTABLE csreftableid in the above example which basically lists the tables by name and a GUID. There is no direct link between the custom column table and the facility table. A lookup is done by doing Select  from CsCustomColumn where tablename  Facilityp  pMy filter works fine when filtering on the standard columns available to the user Name, Country, Address, etc because these columns exist in the Domain amp Mapping.

Negative 1634 pIm currently running an ASP.NET application on our Windows Server 2012 environment. Over the past few days our website and services have been hitting errors and dropping out.p  pWhen looking in the Resource Monitor after the services start to go down, we can see that the CPU is locked at 100 usage. We thought it might be a memory leak, so we increased the amount of memory available to our applications and watched the memory usage, and there was no change.p  pAfter using Process Monitor ProcMon, at the very start of the service crash I was lucky to be watching it at the time, the w3wp.exe service is hit with hundreds of TCP SendTCP Receive requests to itself, from varying ports. For example, it would look something like thisp  precodeTCP Send HOST0123465142 gt HOST0123449685 TCP Send HOST0123465143 gt HOST0123449685 TCP Send HOST0123465145 gt HOST0123449685 TCP Receive HOST0123465145 gt HOST0123449685 TCP Send HOST0123465146 gt HOST0123449685 TCP Send HOST0123465147 gt HOST0123449685 TCP Receive HOST0123465147 gt HOST0123449685 TCP Send HOST0123465149 gt HOST0123449685 codepre  pAs soon as it starts recording the several hundred of these events, the service goes down and we need to recycle our application pool manually. Now I know that it is obviously something in our code that is causing the issue, but Im a bit stuck as to where. When we try to create minidumps, they are less than helpful.p  pI was wondering if it is the WebSocket code we have integrated into our website, on whether its possibly opening ports and not closing them Is that even possiblep  pAre there any other possible explanations for this behaviourp  pstrongEDIT 30052014strongp  pAfter some more digging using Process Explorer and sifting through the few dozen threads of w3wp.exe, Ive found the source of our ills.p  pIt appears that an HTTP PUT request to another server is causing our service to hang, forcing the CPU to lock at 100 until it gets a response. Why it spikes to 100 I do not know, but at least I now have a source of the problem.p

Specifically, suppose I want to initialize foo and bar to separate variablesp  precodeInitializeDefaultsMakeNewObject, foo InitializeDefaultsMakeOtherObject, bar def FunctionWithDefaultsfooNone, barNone    foo should be MakeNewObject and bar should be MakeOtherObject codepre  pThat breaks because in the second decorator, funcargdefaults gets the arguments of the first decorator rather than FunctionWithDefaults.  As a result, I cant tell whether or not a parameter has already been passed in positionally.p  pIs there any clean way to solve this problemp  pThings that dont workp  ul lifunctools.wrapsfunc makes the codenamecode of the function the decorated function, but it doesnt change the arguments unless theres a different way to do it.li liinspect.getcallargs doesnt raise an exception in the second decoratorli liusing func.funccode.covarnames doesnt provide the functions arguments in the second decoratorli ul  pI could just use one decorator, but that seems less clean, and it feels like there should be a cleaner solution.p  pThanksp

I have several jobs setup to notify me if they fail.  p  pMy boss is good with SQL and knows how to maintain the system, but is not a dedicated DBA, which is why they hired me. Well I was just going thru their setup for the AM jobs and they had several fail last night. Wondering why this did not generate any emails, I decided to do a little digging. p  pOne thing I found was that the SQL Server Agent service was running under a domain login that really isnt used anymore except for SQL. I changed the agent to start under the local system account and restarted the service and the emails started coming in.

Id like to use SpagoBI Studio to design a BIRT report that use that same data set and properly pass the data sets required parameters. p  pWhen I try to retrieve the External Data set definition with parameters into a BIRT report, I get an error and it fails to import the data set definition. If I remove those parameters from the data set, retrieving the data set definition works, but I no longer have parameters. p  pIf the External Data Set has String parameters which are used in the querys WHERE clause, then SpagoBI Studio  BIRT will fail when trying to attachretrieve the data set.  Im not able to get to the point where I can specify that null is a permissible value on the parameter in BIRT, because... it fails before it can display the data set fields, params, etc in BIRTp  pWhen the External Data set has Numeric parameters, the whole scenario works fine but Im limited to passing numeric parameters to drive record selection in the query.p  pPlease see the following JIRA. p  pStudio Fails to import External Data Set where query has single quotes wrapping a parameter  a hrefhttpwww.spagoworld.orgjirabrowseSPAGOBI1870 relnofollowhttpwww.spagoworld.orgjirabrowseSPAGOBI1870a p  pDiscussion of the issue on the forum, at a hrefhttpwww.spagoworld.orgjforumpostslist3187.page10288 relnofollowhttpwww.spagoworld.orgjforumpostslist3187.page10288ap

On my mobile site I am using the Foundation OffCanvas plug in that they offer to handle my navigation. However, Ive run into the issue that when I open it and start to scroll through the navigation, the page that the offcanvas is laying on top of also starts scrolling. Is there a prevent default action I can place on the content to prevent the page behind the OffCanvas navigation from scrolling along with the navigation p  pAs far as code goes, everything is straight from foundation. I havent manipulated much other than how the navigation looks in the styles. Functionality is still all the same. And its coming from the left side of the page if that helps at all. p

Negative 1634 pI am using a BackgroundWorker in my winforms app to perform a long running task that occurs in another class performing database operations. Since all the work is done in another class the cancellation is not as simple. I am using an event in the other class codeGenerateStatscode to update the progress as the background operation completes. I want to do a similar thing with cancelling the operation. I cant just call codecancellationPendingcode in the DoWork function because the method would never see it until it finishes and that defeats the purpose. I want the cancellation functionality without having the pass the BackgroundWorker to codegenerateForSubjectcode. Is there anyway that this can support cancellation from the codegenerateForSubjectcode method in codeGenerateStatscode class. This is the instantiation of the class that the operation performs inp  precodeGenerateStats genStats  new GenerateStats codepre  pThis is my DoWork function, which calls the codeReportProgresscode method anytime the event in the other class gets called. It also calls the method from the other class codegenerateForSubjectcode that performs the operations.p  precodeprivate void backgroundWorkerDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e      BackgroundWorker worker  sender as BackgroundWorker      genStats.ProgressChanged  s, pe gt worker.ReportProgresspe.ProgressPercentage, pe.UserState     genStats.generateForSubject  codepre  pThis is the button click event handler that should initiate the cancellation and run codeCancelAsynccodep  precodeprivate void btnStopClickobject sender, EventArgs e      if backgroundWorker.IsBusy              backgroundWorker.CancelAsync       codepre  pThis is my separate class that performs the operation, along with creating the ProgressChanged event handler so my class can updated the form with info on progress. It would be awesome if cancellation can perform similarly.p  precodepublic event ProgressChangedEventHandler ProgressChanged  protected virtual void OnProgressChangedint progress, string message      if ProgressChanged  null              ProgressChangedthis, new ProgressChangedEventArgsprogress, message        public void generateForSubject      Perform db operation not important, but it takes time      OnProgressChanged33, Finished 1st set of stats     I hope to check for cancellation here      Perform db operation not important, but it takes time      OnProgressChanged66, Finished 2nd set of stats     I hope to check for cancellation here              Perform db operation not important, but it takes time      OnProgressChanged99, Finished 3rd set of stats     I hope to check for cancellation here  codepre  pJust to clarify if there is any uncertainty as to what I am asking, is there any way for me to support cancellation of my backgroundWorker in the other class without passing the backgroundWorker to the method. If there is absolutely no way and I have to, then I will pass the backgroundWorkerp

Negative 1634 pI subclassed UINavigationBar, and I have a button that drops down into a drop down menu. I wish to animate and push the contents below the navigation bar down as the navigation bar increases in height. Essentially I want a temporary table in the view of the navigationBar. p  pSo far I overrode sizeThatFits to return the custom sizes for the length I want, which is determined by a state enum. And I call sizeToFit when the navigation bar needs to resize.p  precodeoverride func sizeThatFitssize CGSize gt CGSize      let superSize  super.sizeThatFitssize     var newSize CGSize     ifstate  .Normal          newSize  CGSizeMakesuperSize.width, superSize.height  heightIncrease      else if state  .Menu          newSize  CGSizeMakesuperSize.width, superSize.height  tableIncrease          return newSize   func buttonPressed     ifstate  .Normal         state  .Menu         delegate.didChangeStateTo.Menu      else if state  .Menu         state  .Normal         delegate.didChangeStateTo.Normal          UIView.animateWithDuration0.3, animations          self.sizeToFit       codepre  pWhen I animate sizeToFit, the navigation bar increases in size according to the animation, but the contents below the bar the view of the viewController immediately jumps down to the full length. p  pThis is because sizeThatFits immediately returns the new CGSize. So the animation only works for the navigation bar itself, and the contents of the view do not follow the animation, but jump to their destination.p  pI tried avoiding using sizeThatFits, but UINavigationBar doesnt allow you to change the size of the bar simply by setting the frame with a CGRect. p  pI know there are other ways of going about this without playing around with subclassing UINavigationBar, but with my apps UI this way would be the most effective and code efficient.  p  pThanks in advancep

Now I want to use that parallax scroll effect too but they dont include it with their download I initially thought the parallax scroll effect came with the slideshow.p  pSo Ive been spending HOURS and HOURS trying to locate the source code for this parallax scroll effect and for the life of me, I cannot find it What makes it difficult is that they minify all their code so its almost hopeless for person like me who isnt a javascript guru.p  pSo Ive had to resort to trying out a third party parallax scroll script a hrefhttppixelcog.comparallax.js relnofollowHerea and although I can get this script to work on a single image, Im having no success implementing it into the flickerplate script not surprisingly.p  pHere is the markup for the flickerplate scriptp  precodeltdiv classflickerexample datablocktextfalsegt     ltulgt         ltli databackgroundsantamariainhacaislandmozambique01.jpggtltligt         ltli databackgroundnhoxanilodgesantamariamozambique.jpggtltligt         ltli databackgroundsantamariaaccommodationinhacaisland.jpggtltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pHeres the Markup for a SINGLE image using the Parallax scriptp  precodeltdiv classparallaxwindow dataparallaxscroll dataimagesrcbrabyvillaselfcatering.jpggt ltdivgt codepre  pSo obviously the problem is that this markup is per image per ONE image, so I tried using it with the list items in the flickerplate markup above but that doesnt work  the image  background disappears. Im assuming theres some conflict. This is the problem when trying to use a third party plugin with another.p  pWhat would probably be a lot easier is if I could find the same parallax scroll script that flickerplate used in their demo page, but I cant get any information on it ... maybe you can I just want it like their demo page.p

Nor does disabling all Firefox addons and extensions produce desired rendering on the problem site.

Negative 1634 pI have created a simple map page that is designed to show the locations of various railway photographs using a custom pin on the map. If you hover over the pin, it describes the pin, if you click on it, it opens an infowindow containing a series of links to photographs. p  pI have two issues, one that if you click on the link, then after viewing the photograph you click the back button, the map goes back to a fully zoomed out position again, whereas I would prefer it stayed zoomed in to the position the viewer had left it.p  pThe second issue is that if the viewer uses the Streetview function, it does not have anyway of escaping that function, i.e. there is no back button. I write in Dreamweaver, and if I preview the code in Dreamweaver, Streetview DOES have a back button, yet once I upload the code to my site, it does not. I am puzzled by these different reactions, even though I am using the same browser in both cases.p  pHow can I resolve these issues p  pThis is the code p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale1.0, userscalablenogt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtPhoto Siteslttitlegt     ltstylegt       html, body, mapcanvas          height 100         margin 0px         padding 0px            ltstylegt     ltscript srchttpsmaps.googleapis.commapsapijsv3.expampsignedintruegtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt  function initialize    var mapOptions       zoom 8,     center new google.maps.LatLng36.358548, 144.697350,     mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.HYBRID,     zoomControl true,     zoomControlOptions        style google.maps.ZoomControlStyle.LARGE           var map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmapcanvas,                                 mapOptions   Wrecking Train  From here..                                 var contentString  ltdiv idcontentgt       ltdiv idsiteNoticegt       ltdivgt       lth1 idfirstHeading classfirstHeadinggtOverhead Wrecking Trainlth1gt       ltdiv idbodyContentgt       ltpgtltbgtThe Overhead Wrecking Trainltbgt was photographed as it passed through Bunyip         in December 2012, dismantling the overhead equipment on the Gippsland line.

Negative 1634 pI have a list of items. I also have a list of procedures. Each procedure has a list of items it will process. No procedure will process all items. I need to find the minimum number of procedures that will process all of the items. It is okay if more than one procedure processes any particular item. I could attach a character array to each procedure and then set flags in the array to indicate coverage. When all lists are complete, then I can OR the arrays together until I find a combination that covers all the items. Or I could use bit flags. One involves more memory access, the other involves more manipulation of the data.p

Negative 1634 pSo, say we have codeclass Parentcode, and codeclass Offspringcode that inherits from codeclass Parentcode. To my understanding, when I create an codeOffspringcode object, a codeParentcode object is also created and associated with the codeOffspringcode object. The thing is, if I have already created an independent codeParentcode object, can I use that as the codeParentcode object thats contained within an codeOffspringcode object at the time of its creationp  pI.e. Is it possible not to create a new codeParentcode object within the codeOffspringcode object, and use the original and independent in its place instead Just copying over the data of the original codeParentcode object over to the one thats created within the codeOffspringcode one is obviously not what I want.p

It then dispatches these XEvents directly to Xt with XtDispatchEvent. At this point, I can run the program, and create both XtMotif widgets and Qt widgets in the same program, use menus, draw 2D graphics, and use both Qt amp Motif widgets.p  pThe problem I have, is that there is a lengthy delay when creating new Motif dialogs. I have tracked this down to XtWaitForSomething inside libXt, which ultimately comes down to what is apparently a select or poll on the X servers connection socket. This call to XtWaitForSomething occurs as a result of the layout management of the window occurring inside XtManageChild. XtWaitForSomething appears to be checking if there are events pending in the event queue.p  pI have a number of questionsp  ol lipWhen using both XCB and libX11 calls in the same program with XCB as event queue master can I expect that calls from classic Xlib to also work properly  for example posting events to the XCB event queue via libX11 calls, or determining if there are any events pending in the XCB event queue via old libX11 callspli lipWhy would XtManageChild end up blocking on XtWaitForSomething inside libXt It looks like it may be waiting for a geometry change event. Interestingly, Qts platform layer is reading the XCB events in a separate thread, but then dispatching them in the main thread. I now wonder if Qts XCB reader thread is eating the events before Xt gets a chance to check if event queue contains anything in XtWaitForSomething, leading to a deadlock. Is there any way to cause Qts XCB event loop [or a general XCB event loop] to block while I make calls into Xt I cant just modify Qt to have a condition variable in the XCB layer, since changing Qt is not an option.pli ol  pnbspp  precode0  0x00000037b30e9a5d in poll  from lib64libc.so.6 1  0x000000355f82d468 in XtWaitForSomething  from lib64libXt.so.6 2  0x00007ffff77b871f in XmRootGeometryManager  from lib64libXm.so.2 3  0x000000355f82569f in XtMakeGeometryRequest  from lib64libXt.so.6 4  0x000000355f8257aa in XtMakeGeometryRequest  from lib64libXt.so.6  5  0x00007ffff77b77e6 in geometrymanager  from lib64libXm.so.2 6  0x000000355f8255f4 in XtMakeGeometryRequest  from lib64libXt.so.6 6  0x000000355f8255f4 in XtMakeGeometryRequest  from lib64libXt.so.6 7  0x000000355f8257aa in XtMakeGeometryRequest  from lib64libXt.so.6 8  0x00007ffff773852e in XmMakeGeometryRequest  from lib64libXm.so.2 9  0x00007ffff770ed51 in changemanaged  from lib64libXm.so.2 10 0x000000355f82a2e8 in XtRealizeWidget  from lib64libXt.so.6 11 0x00007ffff771c8d6 in changemanaged  from lib64libXm.so.2 12 0x000000355f82c57d in ManageChildren  from lib64libXt.so.6 13 0x000000355f82ca11 in XtManageChildren  from lib64libXt.so.6 14 0x000000355f82cb18 in XtManageChild  from lib64libXt.so.6 ... codepre  ol start3 lipWhat exactly does event queue owner status in XCB imply [XSetEventQueueOwner..., XCBOwnsEventQueue].

Negative 1634 pI have a D3 scatterplot that filters out data based on input criteria. As the data set remains large, 200 items, having the Axes adjust to scale to the minimum and maximum range is nice.

I can of course, create a new scale that calls when there are less than 4 values and wrap the codexScalecode and codeyScalecode in an codeifcode statement. However, this doesnt seem like a very performant or elegant solution. strongWithout changing the scales, is there a performant way to display these points closer to the visual center of the scatterplotstrongp

I am quite an OpenCV and C newbie so please be quite specific in the responses if possible.p  pI have recently acquired a Dahua IP camera which I have successfully set up, by set up I mean that I can access the live stream over the internet, and can also access it with OpenCVs video capture class, PROVIDED THAT I USE HTTP PROTOCOL with this URLp  pa hrefhttpadminadmin192.168.1.10880cgibinsnapshot.cgichn0ampuadminamppadminamp.mjpg relnofollowhttpadminadmin192.168.1.10880cgibinsnapshot.cgichn0ampuadminamppadminamp.mjpgap  pMy problem is this I can access the stream from my Source.cpp, but cannot do any live image processing on it.

My first problem is that I cannot manipulate the feed set the frame dimensions etc.p  pMy BIGGER problem is that I cannot open the stream in my actual counting program in order to do image processing on it, literally nothing happens. After a bit of googling Ive found that I should rather use the rtsp streaming protocol because it enables me to grab frames from the same source instead of redefining my capture class with each iteration in the while loop. I dont really understand how to do this.p  pI want to be able to stream live from my camera, and do real time image processing on the feed Motion tracking, colour identification and people countingp  pIf anyone has any help it would be GREATLY appreciated, my project is due in 2 weeks.p

Negative 1634 pI help run a small wiki farm with a wiki in several languages, including English the primary, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Russian.p  pRecently I upgraded the server software as followsp  pMediaWiki from 1.14 to 1.25.1 PHP from about 5.2.5 to 5.5.27 MySQL to 5.6.23p  pFor most of the wikis, page loading still works.p  pThe Russian site is the problem. Before the update, any user typing in Cyrillic characters and Cyrillic page titles could always find them. Furthermore, Interwiki links to the Russian version of a page in another language always worked the pages always loaded. But I always knew the page titles themselves were stored as UTF8 and were humanunreadable. Because whenever I would get a watchlist notice of a change on a page on that wiki, the link would come through as UTF8 and display as a lot of weirdlooking characters that definitely were not Cyrillic. But the links were always good and would display as Cyrillic in my browser.p  pBut now no more. If I follow a link, it goes to the special search page. That page brings up several results, all of them with titles I cant read. Usually the first title on the list, is the page Im looking for.p  pBut how do I get the system to find the page by its Cyrillic title, as it always could beforep  pThe other wikis work just fine, as before. But not the Russian one.p

Negative 1634 pOK let me start from the start, I have joined a new team of 5 people for a new and very large project with huge traffic. I have 4 year experience and others are like 10 experienced. Discussion was on selecting a php framework to build application. There concern and plan was to select a fastest framework. They came up with codePhalconcode No one ever worked on it before, I added my views on it in discussion that with phalcon we can not dig into code and their community is not very large so if we got stuck somewhere it gonna be difficult for us to meet delivery dates company is very concerned about delivery dates But they reject my views by saying no other frameworks are slow, they cant handle large traffic and ultimately response time would be very slow if we go with some other framework. I countered, Project performance not very much depend on framework yes its do, but just framework can not make a project faster but more on the right implementation of it like optimised code, good caching mechanism, good server configuration but they rejected my all opinions putting some figure likep  precodePhalcon is 50 times faster than Yii I was recommending Yii, GO language is 70 times faster than PHP etc. codepre  pMy question is from experts here, does frameworks really make this much of difference Because I am not at all satisfied with their points and also with the figures they told me like 50 times faster I dont know from where they got it. Sorry for bad English, its not my native language.p

Negative 1634 pI am building an SSRS report using a cube. I would like to add two parameters, so that they cascade. I would like to use the same Dimension AND hierarchy for both parameters. p  pFor example, if I have strongPerson  Department  Domain  Unitstrong, then I would like the first parameter to have Domain be the values. Then when the user makes a selection for the first parameter, I would like the second parameter to have results filtered based on the first selection. So after the user chooses a Domain, then they can pick a Unit, and these units would be filtered based on the Domain selection. p  pThe problem is that when I try to set up the second parameter, the Department hierarchy is not available, and this is an issue because Unit is under the same hierarchy. I can only provide a hierarchy once for a parameter, then after it is not an available option to choose in Query Designer for a second parameter. p  pDoes any one know why this is or a work around. I am okay with MDX if there are some custom solutions for this. Please help. p

Negative 1634 pMy code runs on CentOS 6.6 on a cluster node with 100GB memory. However this seems still not large enough because my code needs to read 1000 hickle files each 200MB. This is totally 240GB. When the code is running, the system memory cache keeps increasing until full and the code performance becomes very slow when allocating new object and doing numpy arrays calculations. p  pI tried to do emgc.collectem and emdelem to prevent any memory leakage, but the memory is still increasing. I doubt this is due to file caching. So I wonder if there is a function in python sys or os lib that can disable python file system caching when reading large amount 1000 of large hickle files 200MB each or a single lmdb file 240GB. Actually, I dont really need to cache those files once read.p

Negative 1634 pstrongPreamblestrongp  pRecently Ive been struggling with big excel spreadsheets that have a lot of text and comments multiple people work on single document. It is tremendously hard to  edit it again and again considering new notes, since document navigating becomes pretty complicated at some point. So, I decided that I need some tool to getset only the data I actually need at one moment single cell content, corresponsive comment content, additional data for the cells row on demand.p  pstrongWhat is done so farstrongp  pFortunatelly the start was pretty easy. I filled UserForm with 4 textboxes 2 readonly, 2 for editing, that are filled with data of the selected comment by index, and some buttons that allow to acceptdiscard changes and navigate between commented cells.p  pstrongQuestions itselfstrongp  pFirst of all, I need to keep text formatting when I take the text from cell. Currently I am not taking any formatting, just text. All I found by googling is that I can set formatting character by character, sort of like in the following pseudocodep  precodeFor i  0 to CellsRow, Col.Text.Length     MyTextBox.Texti.FormatOption1  CellsRow, Col.Texti.FormatOption1     ...     MyTextBox.Texti.FormatOptionN  CellsRow, Col.Texti.FormatOptionN Next codepre  pBut this approach feels to be stupid. So, question one isp  pemIs there a way to copy full text formatting Font, BIU, color, Size for each letter in the cell alongside with text, from cell to TextBox and backwards, with one line of codeemp  pSecond of all I actually need some formatting tools in the UserForm to do aforesaid text formatting in my form, so question two isp  pemIs there a way to add formatting tools the ones that are located in HomeFont menu, or popup menu when you select some text in a cell into UserForm to edit text in TextBox objectemp  pP.S. using Excel 2013p  pA bit of addition I somehow assume that if there is no direct way to do what Ive described in questions  there has to be some custommade toolbox object sort of EvenRicherTextBox that was created by someone before. I just cannot believe that issue never came up, but I have no idea what keywords I need to use in order to find that object.p
