Positive 8826 pI have a WPF application that contains telerikRadDataForms with the usual sort of controls, TextBlocks, TextBoxes, a number of telerikRadGridViews, etc.p  pThese forms may be displayed in readonly or can be editable. My problem is that my users want to be able to select, then copy to the clipboard, text that is displayed in the TextBoxes, when the forms are in readonly mode, and the controls are disabled.p  pThe problem is that the textboxes arent selectable, and hence the users cant copy the text that is in them.p  pAnyone have any ideasp

Positive 8826 pI have written a bunch of repository methods against my database which I access using Telerik DataOpen Access ORM.  I have written about 30 tests using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting tools. These are not unit tests in the strictest sense, but they exercise each individual repository method please dont assault me with the definition of unit testing ... I know what it is and that I am not doing that. p  pAnyway, everything was going well, until this morning. As I usually do I ran all the tests just to make sure no gnomes changed my code while I slept. I was surprised to see that most of them failed ... but even more surprised to find the cause of their failure was the following error ... p  pstrongem.Net SqlClient Data Provider  Invalid column name voaclassemstrongp  pIf you are familiar with Telerik OpenAccess ORM then you may be familiar with this error, if not, it deals with the presence or lack of of a discriminator column in a vertical inheritance model. strongemvoaclassemstrong is the column the ORM looks for when one is not specifically defined in the fluent description of the data model. p  pThis error is confusing because ... p  ul liThis was working before li liSome of the tests that DID pass were also using the same classes using vertical inheritance, which in theory should also have failed.  li liBoth ends of the discriminator fields ARE being specifically defined in the MappingDescription classes using codeonly approach li liAnd most crazy of all .. when I run the test individually instead of running ALL the tests at the same time ... they passli ul  pI can provide code and whatever if necessary. However, I dont feel its specifically a code issue though since it was working before and the tests run successfully when run individually.

Positive 8826 pI am having an occasional problem with a radGridView where items that I add to an observable collection are not shown in the grid until I mouse over where it should be. Most of the time it works fine, but It is happening enough that it needs to be addressed. Calling rebind doesnt make any difference.p  pWhat could be causing the grid to not update until the mouse is movedp
Positive 8826 pI have a Telerik grid. For the uninitiated, it just means Ive got a table on a page.p  pOn this Telerik grid, Ive got a column for deleting a record. I originally had it so that a user could click, and then it would fire a javascript confirm dialog. If the user hit ok, it would call go the Delete link if not then it would cancel without refreshing the page. That original code is below.p  precode    columns.Template                 lttextgtlta hrefUrl.ContentHazardControlDelete  item.Id  stylecursorpointer onclick  return confirmAre you sure you want to delete this recordgt                     ltimg srcContentImagesDeleteItem.gif altDelete gt                 ltagtlttextgt             .Width50.HtmlAttributesnew  style  textaligncenter  codepre  pNow, the requirements I have now is that they want to check if a record is eligible for deletion before doing that confirm delete, so now my code looks like thisp  precode    columns.Template                     lttextgtlta hrefUrl.ContentTrainingDelete  item.Id  stylecursorpointer onclickdeleteConfirmationitem.Idgt                         ltimg srcContentImagesDeleteItem.gif altDelete gt                     ltagtlttextgt                 .Width50.HtmlAttributesnew  style  textaligncenter           ltscript typetextjavascript gt             function deleteConfirmationrecordId                  .ajax                     url Url.ActionValidateDelete, Training,                     type POST,                     data  id recordId ,                     success function result                          var deleteRecord  false                         if result                              var userConfirm  confirmAre you sure you want to delete this record                             if userConfirm                                  deleteRecord  true                                                                               else                              alertDelete no allowed, the record is in use                                                  return deleteRecord                                                       return false                      ltscriptgt codepre  pI thought Id be able to accomplish this by using an AJAX call before doing the confirm, BUT what actually happens is that the validation part occurs correctly, then the link activates anyway despite returning false or true. I though that when you used the anchor tag and used the onclick method and returned false, then the nothing would happen, but that does not seem to be the case when using AJAX. What am I doing wrong here Has this been done before Is it possible herep

The link above lists tons of clients that support the ICalendar standard, but the three big ones I can see are Apples iCal, Microsofts Outlook, and Googles Gmail.p  pIm starting to get the feeling that each of these client implement different parts of the standard, and Im unsure of what pieces of information we should be trying to export from the application so that someone can put it on their calendar especially around recurrence.p  pFor example, from what I understand Outlook doesnt support hourly recurrence.p  pCould any of you provide guidance of the happy medium here from a features implementation standpointp  pSecondary question, if we decide to cut features from the export such as hourly recurrence because it isnt supported in Outlook, should we support it in the application as well it is a general purpose event scheduling application, with no business specific use in mind...so we really are looking for the happy medium.p

Negative 8826 pWhile programming in C using Visual Studio 2008, I often wish for automatic code generation. If possible, Id like to achieve it by making my MSBuild solution file call out to Rake, which would call Ruby code for the code generation, having the resulting generated files automatically appear in my solution. p  pHeres one business example of many possible examples I could name where this kind of automatic code generation would be helpful. In a recent project I had an interface with some properties that contained dollar amounts. I wanted a second interface and a third interface that had the same properties as the first interface, except they were qualified with a business unit name. Something like thisp  precodepublic interface IQuarterlyResults       double TotalRevenue  get set       double NetProfit  get set    public interface IConsumerQuarterlyResults       double ConsumerTotalRevenue  get set       double ConsumerNetProfit  get set    public interface ICorporateQuarterResults       double CorporateTotalRevenue  get set       double CorporateNetProfit  get set   codepre  pIn this example, there is a Consumer Business Unit and a Corporate Business Unit. Every property on IQuarterlyResults becomes a property called Corporate  [property name] on ICorporateQuarterlyResults, and likewise for IConsumerQuarterlyResults.p  pWhy make interfaces for these, rather than merely having an instance of IQuarterlyResults for Consumer and another instance for Corporate Because, when working with the calculator object I was building, the user had to deal with 100s of properties, and it is much less confusing if he can deal with fully qualified property names such as ConsumerNetProfit.p  pemBut lets not get bogged down in this example. It is only an example and not the main question.emp  pstrongThe main question is thisstrong I love using Ruby and ERB for code generation, and I love using Rake to manage dependencies between tasks. To solve the problem above, what Id like to do is have MSBuild call out to Rake, and have Rake  Ruby read the list of properties on the core interface and then generate the code to make all the dependent interfaces and their properties. This would get triggered every time I do a build, because Id put it into the MSBuild file for the VS.NET solution.p  pHas anyone tried anything like this How did it work out for you What insights can you share about pros, cons, tips for success, etc.p  pThanksp

Negative 8826 pIm using a HttpModule to rewrite the urls on a multilingual site. In the HttpModule, Im adding a handler for the BeginRequest event, and looking for the first part of the path which contains the culture name.p  pFor example, frcaindex.aspx will be rewritten to index.aspx and set the threads culture and ui culture to 3084. This works fine.p  pEnter forms authentication. Forms authentication still works fine with the unmapped url, but if the user is unauthorized, it will redirect to the loginUrl as set in the authentication section of the web.config, and include the ReturnUrl querystring parameter to handle redirecting back to the requested page once the user is authenticated.p  pThere are two problems here if the user requests a page in a language other than the defaultp  ol liThe loginUrl ignores the path before its rewrittenli liThe ReturnUrl parameter also ignored the raw path.li ol  pIts equivalent to Request.Url.PathAndQuery instead of Request.RawUrl.p  pI cant jump into the pipeline at the AuthorizeRequest event instead because then Id have to protect against all possible culture values, because Im using one web.config file with multiple location paths. This also doesnt fix the first issue.p  pIve gone through the FormsAuthenticationModule in reflector and I see where I could change it to solve 1 and 2, but its of course sealed.p  pIve also browsed around a lot, but I cant see any workable solutions.p  pThe FormsAuthenticationModule is checking for a 401 header thats generated in UrlAuthorizationModule. If you look for the referrer which is empty on the loginUrl page it confirms that.p  pAny thoughtsp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pIm using IIS 6, and IIS 7 is not an option.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThe login page wasnt picking up the default cultureui culture because when I generated the local resource design view Tools  Generate Local Resource, the IDE added the following to the page directivep  pcultureauto metaresourcekeyPageResource1 uicultureautop  pBe careful with this in vs.net 2008 At least this solves one of the problems with the default culture not being referenced, but 1 and 2 are still outstanding.p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI hoped that I could jump into one of the pipeline events to do my own redirect, but in Reflecting the System.Web.Security.UrlAuthorizationModule OnEnter method, I learned that once the 401 header is set, the method calls application.CompleteRequest, which as you can guess, brings us right to the EndRequest event. This is what the FA module jumps into the do the redirect, and Im afraid I cant jump in front to do my own redirect Im surprised there arent more people coming across this issue, or perhaps they havent chimed in yet.p  phr p  pExamplep  pI have a members section in the physical folder members thats protected by forms authentication.p  pIn the web.config, I havep  precodeltauthentication modeFormsgt   ltforms loginUrlmemberslogin.aspx timeout40 gt ltauthenticationgt codepre  pand...p  precode  ltlocation pathmembersgt       ltsystem.webgt       ltauthorizationgt       ltdeny users gt       ltallow rolesMembers gt       ltdeny users gt       ltauthorizationgt       ltsystem.webgt   ltlocationgt codepre  pWhen an unauthenticated user requests the index page of members, they get redirected to the loginUrl from the authentication section above by the FormsAuthenticationModule. It also appends the ReturnUrl parameter with the requested page.p  pThis works just fine if a user is browsing the website using the default culture, but my HttpModule sets the culture based on the presence of a culture name in the first part of the path.p  pSo, frcamembersindex.aspx gets rewritten to membersindex.aspx and sets the cultureui culture to Canadian French. Unforunately, the FormsAuthenticationModule sends the user to the loginUrl page with the rewritten url, not the original. So, the culture setting is lost and the redirect url is incorrect.p  pHope that helps Gregp

Negative 8826 pWhile choosing between shared hosting and Cloud hosting I have always been inclined to go for the latter. However one aspect that always worries about Cloud is security. Here Ill try to be more specific.  p  pWhen I go for shared hosting, the foundation softwares are already there for me and they are configured to the best suitable security for web I am hoping this assumption is correct. However when I get hold of an instance in the cloud, I usually have to do every possible configuration myself. Further I have to keep track of security updates released, etc. I hope you get the point. This is intimidating as I would loose focus from my application.  p  pOf course one would say that I can go for exclusive virtual hosting or even dedicated hosting that many providers offer. But there the cost is weird and those benefits of cloud especially scalability are ruled out.  p  pSo Id like to know how one can be on cloud and be relieved of systems  upkeep as wellp

Outlook caches all the email locally to a pst file before pushing to Exchange.

Negative 8826 pI am starting the design of a somewhat large enterprise platform in Python, and was wondering if you guys can give me some advice as to how to organize the various components and which packages would help achieve the goals of scalability, maintainability, and reliability. p  pThe system is basically a service that collects data from various outside sources, with each outside source having its own separate application. These applications would poll a central database and get any requests that have been submitted to perform on the external source. p  pThere will be a main website and RESTSOAP API that should also have access to the central data service. p  pMy initial thought was to use Django for the web site, web service and data access layer using its builtin ORM, and then the outside source applications can use the web services to get the information they need to process the request and save the results. Using this method would allow me to have multiple instances of the service applications running on the same or different machines to balance out the load. Are there more elegant means of accomplishing this ive heard of messaging systems such as MQ, would something like that be beneficial in this scenariop  pMy other thought was to use a completely separate data service not based on Django, and use some kind of remoting or remote objects in they exist in Python to interact with the data model. The downside here would be with the website which would become much slower if it had to push all of its data requests through a second layer.p  pI would love to hear what other developers have come up with to achieve these goals in the most flexible way possible.p
Negative 8826 pI am working on a WCF rest interface using json.  I have wrapped the service in a windows service to host the service but I am now having trouble getting the service to be callable.

The problem is most likely in the configuration file, since I am new to WCF and Rest I wasnt really sure what to type for the configuration so sorry if its a total mess.p  pI removed several chunks of code and comments to make it a little easier to read.  These functions should have no bearing on the service since they call only C functions.p  pbEDITb  I looked at the post suggested, and rewrote the code, but unfortunately, it still is not functional.  Mabye Im just using the wrong address, you would invoke this with a hrefhttplocalhost7600 relnofollowhttplocalhost7600a, rightp  pbEDITb  Thanks guys for all your help.  The problem was that you cannot use ServiceHost with a property that uses UriTemplate.  So if I remove that, the service at least halfway works.  I still am stuck on one part though.

Negative 8826 pMy program uses a codeNetworkOutputcode object which can be used to write data to a remote server. The semantic is that in case the object is currently connected because there is a remote server, then the data is actually sent over the socket. Otherwise, its silently discarded. Some code sketchp  precodeclass NetworkOutput  public    Constructs a NetworkOutput object this constructor should not block, but it     should start attempting to the given hostport in the background.         In case the connection gets closed for some reason, the object should immediately     try reconnecting.       NetworkOutput const stdstring amphostName, unsigned short port      Tells whether there is a remote client connected to this NetworkOutput object.     Clients can use this function to determine whether they need to both serializing     any data at all before calling the write function below.       bool isConnected const     Write data to the remote client, if any. In case this object is not connected     yet, the function should return immediately. Otherwise it should block until     all data has been written.         This function must be threadsafe.       void write const stdvectorltchargt ampdata   codepre  pRight now, I have this implemented using nonblocking sockets. In the codeNetworkOutputcode constructor, Im creating a TCP socket as well as an internal helper window. I then do a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms741540VS.85.aspx relnofollowWSAAsyncSelecta call on the socket. This makes the socket nonblocking, and it will cause a magic window message which I registered myself to be sent to the internal helper window in case any interesting event such as connection established or connection closed happens on the socket. Finally, I start a connection attempt using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms741559VS.85.aspx relnofollowWSAConnecta. This returns immediately, and the window procedure of my internal helper window will get notified as soon as the connection succeeded. In case the connection is closed because the remote client went away, the message procedure will be called and I will attempt to reconnect.p  pThis system allows the me to attach and detach a remote client at will. It works quite well, but unfortunately it requires that I have a message loop running. Without the message loop, the notifications sent by the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms741540VS.85.aspx relnofollowWSAAsyncSelecta call dont seem to arrive at my helper window.p  pIs there any way to implement a class as described above without requiring a message loop I was toying around with using blocking sockets in a helper thread, but I couldnt come up with anything reasonable yet. I also considered using a UDP socket, so that I dont even need to connect at all, but Id like to know whether there is a remote client listening so that in case there is emnoem remote client, the clients of the codeNetworkOutputcode class dont need to do any serialization work of complex objects before they can call codewritecode.p

Negative 8826 pI am running into a strange issue Ive been able to track down somewhat but I still cant see the cause. Maybe someone here can shed some lightp  pIm running on a PowerPC processor on top of VxWorks 5.5 developing in C with the PPCgnu604 toolchain.p  pI have a class like sop  precodeclass MyClass    public     void run void    private     CommandMesssageClass command     StatusMessageClass status  codepre  pWhen my application is started, it will dynamically allocate an instance of MyClass and spawn a thread pointing to its run function. Essentially it just sits there polling for commands and, upon receipt, will issue a status back.p  pNote that this is a chopped down version of the class. There are a number of other methods and variables left out for brevity.p  pThe issue I see is when both the command and status messages are defined as private class members I will get a change in the available bytes in memory despite the fact there should be no dynamic memory allocation. This is important because this is ocurring in what needs to be a deterministic and ratesafe procedure.p  pIf I move one or both of the message declarations into the run function, it works fine with no additional allocationp  pI must be missing something fundamental in my understanding of C declarations and memory allocation. My understanding is that a class instance that I dynamically instansiate will be fully allocated on the heap including all member variables when its created. The difference I see here would be that moving the message declarations to the run function puts them on the stack instead. The heap in this case is more than large enough to accompadate the entire size of the class. Why does it seem not to be allocating enough memory until specific portions are usedp  pThe message classes do no dynamic allocation of their own. And if they did, I would expect moving the declaration would not change the behavior in this case and I would still see a change in the size of the heap.p  pTo monitor the memory allocation Im using the following VxWorks memLib or memPartLib callp  precodememPartInfoGet memSysPartId, amppartitionStatus  ... bytesFree  partitionStatus.numBytesFree codepre  pEditp  pTo clarify, the MyClass object is instansiated and initialized in an initialization routine and then the code enters ratesafe processing. During this time, upon the receipt of a command message over a serial line the first interaction with the Command or Status message objects additional memory is allocated or rather the number of bytes free decreases. This is bad because dynamic memory allocation is not deterministic.p  pIve been able to get rid of the problem by moving the class variables as Ive described.p

Negative 8826 pIm doing a codeDictionaryltgtcode lookup in an On2 loop and need it to be ridiculously fast.  Its not.  Does anyone have any insight into how codeDictionaryltgtcode is implemented  Im testing Dictionary performance with an isolated test case after running my code through a profiler and determining Dictionary lookups are the bulk of the CPU time..  My test code is like thisp  precodeInt32[] keys  new Int32[10]  38784, 19294, 109574, 2450985, 5, 398, 98405, 12093, 909802, 38294394   DictionaryltInt32, MyDatagt map  new DictionaryltInt32, MyDatagt Add a bunch of things to map   timer.Start Object item for int i  0 i lt 1000000 i     for int j  0 j lt keys.Length j           bool isFound  map.ContainsKeykeys[j]       if isFound                 item  map[keys[j]]             timer.Stop codepre  pContainsKey and map[] are the two slow parts equally slow..  If i add a TryGetValue, its nearly identical in speed to ContainsKey.  Heres some interesting facts..p  pA codeDictionaryltGuid, Tgtcode is about twice as slow as codeDictionaryltInt32, Tgtcode.  codeDictionaryltString, Tgtcode is about twice as slow as a Guid dictionary.  A codeDictionaryltByte, Tgtcode is a good 50 faster than using Ints.  This leads me to believe that a Dictionary is doing an Olog n binary search to find the key, and the comparison operators on the keys are the bottleneck.  For some reason, I dont believe its implemented as a Hashtable, because .NET already has a Hashtable class, and in my experience its even slower than Dictionary.p  pThe dictionaries Im building are only accessed by one thread at a time, so read locking is not an issue.  RAM is also not an issue.  The dictionary will most likely only have about 10 buckets, but each bucket can point to one of about 2,000 possibly things.  Does anyone have any feedback on how to make this faster  Thanksp  pMikep

That would be a nice solution instead of having to add more accounts to the administrator set. Step 1 go into local security policy and add the build service account to all permissions currently given to Administrators. In theory, that should allow the build to succeed, and from there I could selectively remove permissions until Ive isolated all the permissions that must be held in order for it to succeed.p  pUnfortunately, even with all the same permissions, the build will still fail unless the build service account is a member of local administrators.

Negative 8826 pSpecifically, I have written a Rails app in which Im using the default in Rails 2.3.5 codeCookieStorecode session store and Ive spotted an odd problem in development.p  pMyself and a few others had been using the site for a few weeks and we each had a login based on a username and password each user registered themselves and I stored the salted and hashed data in the database.  I was storing the user ID in the Rails codesessioncode object and, therefore, in the cookie that is passed back and forth between browser and server.p  pOne important point here since this is an intranet site, I set the cookies to stay alive for up to 2 weeks to avoid users having to log in all the time.p  pToday I reset the database, wiping all user records and all other data, intentionally.  A few users started registering themselves again and then one user found that the first time they went to the site since the wipe they were automatically loggedin as a different userp  pI think I can see why this happened the user ID passed from that users browser to the server now matched a different userrecord in my database.  My initial thought was oh dear, I wasnt expecting that but the more I thought about it the more I realised this was probably expected behaviour.p  pI realise I can change my Rails app to user codeActiveRecordStorecode but before I did that I wanted to make sure I understand whats going on here.  Specifically, does the combination of using codeCookieStorecode sessions and having the sessions stay alive for some time really create such a gaping security hole  Or am I missing something  Should the codesessionidcode be providing a little more security herep
Negative 8826 pIm trying to implement a class in a Silverlight 4 RIA Services application that manages different ObservableCollections that are used for data binding. These ObservableCollections need to be identified by a string name and an integer classID, which I have implemented by nesting Dictionary objects in a Dictionary object.

The problem seems to occur when I am trying to put an ObservableCollection into an ObservableCollection my guess as to how a generic entity list would be implemented.p  pFor examplep  precode  this.rawData  new Dictionaryltint, ObservableCollectionltDataRawgtgt   this.constData  new Dictionaryltint, ObservableCollectionltSystemConstantgtgt    this.masterData  new Dictionaryltstring, Dictionaryltint, ObservableCollectionltEntitygtgtgt    masterData.Addtest, rawData  lt ERROR OCCURS HERE, best overloaded method has invalid arguments codepre  pNote that I have tried using Object instead of Entity in the instantiation of masterData, but that did not solve the problem it was admittedly a feeble attempt.p  pThanks in advance for your insights. If there is a much better pattern I could be implementing here, I am open to being flexible. I mainly want to avoid having to code a bunch of Entitytype specific logic to manage the updating of this class. It seems like this should be generalizable.p  pAlexp

Negative 8826 pId like to know if UML is useful to describe heavilytemplated code. I know that there is a notion of parametrized classes in UML codevectorltTgt  lt ltltbindgtgt  vectorltintgtcode, but this wont be enough to describe complex emducktypedem relationships that we can have with templates. I can always put associations between such classes, but it seems to me that it wont actually help to understand how it works.p  pMoreover, considering for example the STL library, the algorithms are often implemented as functions, and thus dont fit very well into the OOP model, though they still behave quite like objects introducing associations between classes.p  pSo, does it make sense to draw UML diagrams to describe such templated code If so, which kinds of diagrams would be most useful  in standard OOP Ive seen class diagrams being used most of the time, but probably for templated code some other kinds of diagrams would be more helpful If UML is not well suitable for that, what else could I use Thanks.p
Negative 8826 pIm new to rails and apologize if this is a n00b question.p  pIm making the obligatory recipe management site and want to have each recipe have a list of tags where the tag db just contains a string called name .  Here are my models to give you some contextp  precodeclass Recipe lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany links   hasmany tags, through gt links   validates name, ingredients, directions, presence gt true   acceptsnestedattributesfor tags,         allowdestroy gt true,         rejectif gt rejecttag    def rejecttaga       ...   end end  class Tag lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany links   hasmany recipes, through gt links end   class Link lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto recipe   belongsto tag end codepre  pBasically each recipe has a list of tags through the link connector table and vice versa.  The recipe form is accepting nested attributes for the tags.  The behavior I want is for duplicated tags to not be entered into the tags table, but just a new link pointing to the already existing tag be created.  So if I have a tag with name Healthy and enter a new recipe and add the tag Healthy to it I dont want duplicate Healthy tags in the tag table.  All thats needed is a new entry in the link table linking the new recipe to the old tag.p  pWhats the rails approach to doing this.  Right now Im trying to hack it by passing the recipeid in a hidden input field into the rejectif lambda and save a new link there.  It works for editing an existing recipe, but not for creating a new one, since there is no recipe.id yet.  This feels like a bad approach and Im just not sure how to go about this.  Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 8826 pI use codeStreamResourceInfo.Streamcode to get codeBitmapImagecodes from resources. Is it correct to codeClosecode and codeDisposecode the stream after using it I ask because in memory profiler, I get an error if I do so. Memory profiler says that a disposed instance has not been GCed.   p  pIf I look on the web, I only can find a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSwpfthread00593ed9be5c4f0aad4f5c86a991e18a relnofollowthisa post to this topic. In this post, the responding person says, that it is meaninfull to dispose. However if I look at the circumstances and on the effect, I dont think that this is right. Does someone know what is the right actionbr Additional information In the msdn examples I have seen, they dont Dispose or Close.p  pstrongEditstrongbr Thanks to Rick Sladkeys answer, I found the solution I assign codeStreamResourceInfo.Streamcode to the codeStreamSourcecodeproperty of the codeBitmapImagecode. In a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.media.imaging.bitmapimage.streamsource.aspx relnofollowmsdna is written p  pemSet the CacheOption property to BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad if you wish to close the stream after the BitmapImage is created. The default OnDemand cache option retains access to the stream until the bitmap is needed, and cleanup is handled by the garbage collector.emp  pThis means, codeBitmapImagecode takes the ownership of the stream. And thats why memory profiler shows an error if I CloseDispose the stream manually Bitmap will hold a reference to the stream BitmapCacheOption OnDemand and therefore GC will not release it as long as the BitmapImage is valid, but the stream is already explicitely disposed. In this specific example, disposing is a bad idead.br For completness, I have also looked in msdn for the example of the above link where codeTextRange.Loadcode was called. For codeLoadcode, it is the opposite, codeLoadcode does not take the ownership and therefore the stream must be closeddisposed after finishing. p
Negative 8826 pI am getting lots of push back from Rails because I have subclassed User into many different subclasses. In my application, not all users are equal. Theres actually a lot of model objects and not every User type has access to them.p  pI also need a way to do polymorphic behaviour. For example, many methods will behave differently depending on the type. Isnt that what polymorphism is forp  pBut the thing is, I am always getting push back from Rails. The defaults  especially the way forms submit to parameter hashes  seem to work like nonsubclassed models. Links and parameter hashes are just two ways in which the defaults really bite you.p  pWhat is the right way to handle complex logic for different types of Users in Rails In Java, the subclassing model works  you dont have to go through hoops to get it to work the way you want to. But in Rails, its hard to get subclasses to work with REST conventions, it punishes you when you forget to include codeas gt usercode, or it punishes you when you put a subclassed  object in links, such as codeedituserpathusercode lt bad ideap  pTheres one other area which is also very hard to deal with. Lets say I have a codeCompanycode model and it has many codeUserscode. These users can be directors, instructors, trainees, etc  all different subclasses.p  pWhen we create the account, we might want to use codeacceptsnestedattributesfor userscode. However, if we use this, we cant specify the classes that it creates. Bloody hellp  pIt seems like everything in Rails is designed to not want you to subclass your models. If you dont subclass, everything just works. But if you subclass, you are in for hell.p  pWhat is the solutionp

Negative 8826 pCurrently we have a very simple but effective release process. We tag a new version in SVN. This version will is exported to a test environment.

I wanted to do this minifying on our testenvironment in the process of releasing to Acceptance, so that both on the Acceptance environment and Production environment we have minified files. However, if I minify the files there, the timestamps change, and rsync will every time transfer ALL css and js files, even though the minified content hasnt changed. p  pMy question is what is best practice to solve this  Should I use a different mechanism than rsync to release a new version  Should I put the minified versions in SVN already But I dont want minified files in development, so what is the best moment to minify and possibly combine them p  pWe use PHP 5.3.6 and I started looking at Yuicompressor because I can easily use it in scripts. p

Negative 8826 pI have an NSArrayController bound to a property of an NSManagedObject subclass. The subclass is automatically generated by mogenerator which creates a set property for the relationship.p  pThe NSArrayController is bound to network.posts where posts is a 1M relationship. Note I am binding to posts rather than the postsSet mutableSet accessor generated by mogenerator.p  pThe set represents a relationship with another entity. The array controller has a sort descriptor set and, when the window it is associated with opens, data is displayed in the correct sort order.p  pThen I add a new object by instantiating an entity and then adding it to the relationship.p  pThe NSArrayController is correctly observing this change and the new object appears in emarrangedObjectsem however, after the insert the sort order of arrangedObjects is lost and the records appear in a different order.p  pI have verified that the sort descriptor is still set correctly. The NSArrayController has autoRearrangeContentYES. Ive even tried manually calling rearrangeObjects after the insert but the sort order remains wrong.p  pIf I close the window and reopen the newly instantiated NSArrayController has the data with the correct sort order again. Until I do another insert.p  pMy experience has been that NSArrayController has automatically kept the correct sort order when objects are addedremoved but maybe that was a lucky coincidencep  pI cant find any description of the correct behaviour in the Apple document so Ive no idea what to expect, what might be going wrong if anything, or  in either case  what I should do about it.p  p1 Given a sortDescriptor should NSArrayController be keeping arrangedObjects sorted after objects are insertedremoved from the underlying collectionp  p2 If so, what might prevent this from happeningp  p3 And, if not, what is the correct way to keep arrangedObjects sortedp  pId be grateful for any help.

Negative 8826 pI have trawled Google over and over but I cannot find anything about storing a variable in the cache. Anything I have seen related to the matter looked very complicated and was not well explained. I am designing a very simple login system with GWT using a textfile that edits a users line by appending true or false depending on whether they are logged in or out respectively. p  pThe problem is that when the user refreshes the window they are not logged out because I dont want them to be but the application has lost the current user variables so it appears that they are logged out. I would like to cache the username of the current user until they logout so that I can allow the user to refreshclose the tab and still be logged in. I am looking for quite an in depth explanation as I have littleno previous experience with caching If the question seems stupid or a solution is not possible please tell mep

Negative 8826 pIve spent the day playing around with the GreenDroid PagedView and PagedAdaptor to create multiple screens that one can swipe through a la iPhone style and Android Home Screen style.  Its a very cool effect and the GreenDroid library is awesome.  Soo.. I can get this working for one XML layout code below, but what I am attempting to do is have three screens with different layouts. Ive played around and got it working successfully with one method, but am unsure whether the method Im using will cause problems due to repeat inflation of XML layout at every method call.

Negative 8826 pIm trying to create a Control that basically allows me to draw different strings underneath one another. However, the strings width may not be larger than the controls. In order to solve that problem, I was thinking of passing a RectangleF object to the Graphics.DrawString method. That would wrap strings which are wider than the passed rectangles width. Although this does solve the problem of not being able to see the whole string if its too big, there is another problem. If I were to try something like thisp  precodeGraphics g  e.Graphics  Paint event g.DrawStringsomeText, someFont, someBrush, new PointF0, 0, someRectangleF g.DrawStringsomeMoreText, someFont, someBrush, new PointF0, 12, someRectangleF codepre  pthe problem would be that if someText gets wrapped, the third line will paint text over of the first text, thus making it hardimpossible to be read.p  pI was looking for a solution for this problem, and I found some interesting links, which however included the use of a for loop which would measure each characters width and so on. Is there any simpler ways of doing thisp

Negative 8826 pI have a Client Center on my website which is only accessible via HTTPS. Im currently using a single session cookie to track PHP session variables such as UserAuthenticated, ClientID, etc once they log in.p  pI want to change the links on my navigation bar from Login to Logout  Client Center once they have logged in. This is easy enough, but most of my website has absolute links that point to HTTP instead of HTTPS. I could make all of my links relative and that way hopefully keep them on HTTPS once theyve logged in, but my site is graphicsintensive and I cant guarantee that theyll stay on HTTPS if, for instance, they type a hrefhttpmysite.com relnofollowhttpmysite.coma on their browser after logging in.p  pMy question is as followsp  p1 Is there a risk in passing this cookie over HTTP I hear that it can be intercepted and spoofed. That would be badp  p2 Can I use two cookies, one which is a secureonly cookie which contains their credentials, and another which just lets the browser know if theyre logged in or not, for the links on my navigation bar Is it possible to use multiple sessions simultaneously like this with different cookiesp  pIve also heard about using a databasebased session management system, but for now that is way over my head. Im new to PHP and MySQL this is my first site.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8826 pI am hoping this is a simple fix, or maybe my logic is just off. I am creating an accordion menu using jquery.

I want the user to be able to expand and collapse the accordion, and when a schedule is chosen, the selected schedule will be outlined in red with a light grey background. What I have is working, it is just applying the arrow rotation and the toggleClass to every element rather than the single one selected.p  pWhat is happening currently is when you click Schedule, all of the arrows are rotating instead of the single one. Also, when a radio button is selected , it is highlighting every div with the clickedSchedule class.p  pI think this has to do with using the this in the function...I am just not sure how to write it.

Negative 8826 pIve noticed a little problem in WPF. If you twoway bind properties in a chain codeA ltgt B, B ltgt C, C ltgt D ...code, everything is fine until you introduce two or more converters.p  pNow, with one converter, it still works, but when you add two converters in the chain codeA ltxgt B, B ltgt C, C ltxgt D ...code, it can get stuck in an infinite loop, if the properties change fast enough.p  pIt seems as if WPF is very smart about avoid infinite recursion, but if the changes come too quick, it hurdles whatever is blocking for you, and goes to infinity.p  pThe point at which I noticed this is when I was prototyping my own color editor. I wanted the color selection to be accomplished by an bitmap crossing hue and lightness, with another slider saturation. To make sure the sliders were in synch I needed to bind with a converter to and from color. Now, I ran into computation problems, so I created a class that managed converting but only did so when needed, and bound everything to that. Problem is that when I bound outside my control, I hit an infinite recursion if the user moved over the color palettes really fast.p  pI traced it down to an interesting effect. The converter when setup as two way, would trigger forward, then quickly back to reflect any conversion loss. But when chained with another converter that did the same, they bounced back and forth endlessly, like ping pong.p  pThis only happened if the converters were triggered fast enough. So Im guessing I overflowed some value that counted recursion stack.p  pstrongHas anyone else noticed anything to this effect, and how can you avoid such problems when people use binding against the result value property of your controlstrongp

Negative 8826 pI am writing a ZF application.  I had some abstract parent classes in a library directory.  Netbeans could generate test skeletons for the child classes no problems, and I could run the tests no problem.p  pLater on I decided to move the abstract parents out of the library and in to the application directory to improve readability.  I updated my application code accordingly, and it runs no problem.p  pHowever, now when I use netbeans to generate test skeletons for the child classes, it gives a fatal error saying it can not find the parent.  I then constructed a test class manually and ran it from the command line, and PHPUnit gave the same error.p  pWhat do I need to do to get this pathing working correctly  In the PHPUnit bootstrap I tried adding the Application directory to the include path, and registering Application as a namespace with the Zend Autoloader.  I dont think this is a recommended practice, and it failed anyhow...p  pI really do struggle with path issues, finding files, etc...p  pAny assistance is much appreciated.p

Negative 8826 pThe answers to my a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions154034amazonsoadatabaseasaserviceprevious questiona about the database access and service abstraction helped me to understand that in SOA a database service should provide a public API, but not a direct access SQL or via ORM to the database.p  pNow, if I want to create a SOA service in an ErlangOTP application, I think it should be a genserver or other OTP behaviour, because in that case the API will be easily defined and the service itself can be easily incorporated into the application.p  pBut how should I pass data from the service to its consumerp  pI know that in Ruby on Rails I can do something like p  precodepersons  Person.findall codepre  pThen I can just return codepersonscode to the service consumer.p  pIn ErlangOTP if codepersonscode is a few thousands records, should I pass it in the genserver return statement This means that the genserver will send a message to its caller service consumer and the message will be essentially copied in the Erlang VM. I tend to think that it is not a proper use of Erlang message passing.p  pSo my question isp  ul liHow can I create a database service SOA in ErlangOTP li liShould the API of such a service use the OTP standard mechanisms like genserver return message or anything elseli ul

Negative 8826 pIm playing around with text transformations  ciphers. From all that I have surveyed it seems  that all of these algorithms either break even in terms of transformed message length, or get larger. Are there any known algorithmstext transformations that when applied to a message actually make the message smaller not counting the key, of coursep  pFor instance, RSA, when you encode the message, makes the encrypted message quite a bit larger than the original. Is there any such thing as that only the message becomes smaller, instead of larger, after encryption, transformation, etc whatever you want to call itp  pIm not doing this as part of security, so whether or not its hackable is not of any interest to me. p  pP.S. Ive done a lot of research in this area already through search engines google, wikipedia, etc but I have found no results. I dont want to say that such a technique doesnt exist without at least posting the question publicly first.p  pThanksp

Our FB app handles the intent because it is an effective way for users to share content such as links e.g. your app URL on their Facebook.

Surely I can understand facebooks position to some extend and anyway we have to accept it I guess.

Negative 8826 pIm trying to migrate from the Web Site Project style to use the Web Application Project instead. p  pThe AppCode folder is missing, and I have read the reasons why, about compilation to .dlls and so, and why I should not include and reference both classes and dlls. That is fine. It is recommended that  I move my .vb classes from the AppCode or simply rename the folder to CodeFolder. I have now  done that. p  pBut I am used to have a class named Globals.vb in the AppCode folder with global variables and functions which I can access throughout my entire site without instatiation.p  pMy Globals.vb could for example look likep  precodePublic Class Globals    Inherits System.Web.HttpApplication          Public Shared Path As String  ConfigurationManager.AppSettingsWebPath          Public Shared strSql as String           Public Shared Function ConvertVBLineBreaksToHTMLByval s as String as string               Code here          End Function  End Class codepre  pAnd so on. How do I accomplish that with a WAP And also, what about .xsd datasets in my previous AppCode folder which also were accessible from anywherep  pBest regards.  p

Negative 8826 pIHttpAsyncHandler means run the request asynchronously.p  pUsing the thread pool also can run asynchronously.p  pSo if I want to implement a function like Comet,long poll, between using thread pool with IHttpHandler and using IHttpAsyncHandler, which is betterp  pEDIT Jon Skeet Thank you for your patient reply. Let me make a conclusion. If I use delegate.BeginInvoke in the IHttpHandler,the Main Thread of processing request still keeps spinning until the request end,no matter what happened with the pooled thread. If I use the IHttpAsyncHandler, the Main Thread of processing request will call the BeginProcessRequest and after that,it will be released to process other request. The BeginProcessRequest method will do something asynchronously. When the asynchronous action finished,the EndProcessRequest method will be called.or we can say the Main Thread will call the EndProcessRequest function to finished current requestp  pAll above are what I think, is it rightp

Negative 8826 pIve been playing around with Zurb Foundation to evaluate its suitability for my next project. I stumbled upon a characteristic Im not comfortable with when resizing the width of the browser so Id like to confirm if there is any way to do it.p  pSay I have a grid with four images columns per row. As I shrink the width of the browser window my natural expectation would be that the amount of images would shrink down to first three, then two and finally one image per row as the width reduces.p  pBut instead what Foundation seems to do is shrink the divs as much as it can to keep the four columns per row and as it runs out of space to have four it jumps right down to one image per row directly.p  pThis behavior to me is not logical so I assumed there must be a way to do it, but going through a hrefhttpfoundation.zurb.comdocsgrid.php relnofollowhttpfoundation.zurb.comdocsgrid.phpa I wasnt able to find a way to do it either with divs or block grids.p  pI sort of assumed this would be 101 functionality of responsive grids, but I dont have much experience on these css frameworks.

Negative 8826 pI am an SVN newbie so I apologize if I dont know the correct terminology or if this is a simple question. p  pI have a production server running revision 231 and a staging server running revision 238. I am currently making all sorts of changes in revision 238 which are not yet ready to go live.p  pHowever, the client has a quick change that needs to be made ASAP to the production server running revision 231. I thought I could just update my local copy to revision 231, make the change, commit it, launch the new revision on my production server, then go back to making my changes to revision 238.  p  pHowever, doesnt seem to like that. Tortoise keeps failing the commit telling me things are in conflict. I have tried making my head revision 231 but couldnt get that to stick either. p  pReading through all of the help files, everything that says revert and undo scare me because I do not wish to lose the more current revisions. I just need to touch that old one for a sec then go back to working on my more current files.p  pHow can this be accomplished Or even just help me with what is the correct terminology for doing what I am wanting to do so I know what to search the TortoiseSVN help for p  pThanksp

Negative 8826 pLets say we have a stream containing simplyp  precodehello codepre  pNote that theres no extra codencode at the end like there often is in a text file. Now, the following simple code shows that the codeeofcode bit is set on the stream after extracting a single codestdstringcode.p  precodeint mainint argc, const char argv[]    stdstringstream sshello   stdstring result   ss gtgt result   stdcout ltlt ss.eof ltlt stdendl  Outputs 1   return 0  codepre  pHowever, I cant see why this would happen according to the standard Im reading C11  emISOIEC 148822011Eem. codeoperatorgtgtbasicstreamlt...gtamp, basicstringlt...gtampcode is defined as behaving like a emformatted input functionem. This means it constructs a codesentrycode object which proceeds to eat away whitespace characters. In this example, there are none, so the codesentrycode construction completes with no problems. When converted to a codeboolcode, the codesentrycode object gives codetruecode, so the extractor continues to get on with the actual extraction of the string.p  pThe extraction is then defined asp  blockquote   pCharacters are extracted and appended until any of the following occursp      ul   licodencode characters are storedli   liendoffile occurs on the input sequenceli   licodeisspacec,is.getloccode is true for the next available input character emcem.li   ul      pAfter the last character if any is extracted, is.width0 is called and the sentry object k is destroyed.   If the function extracts no characters, it calls codeis.setstateiosfailbitcode, which may throw codeiosbasefailurecode 27.5.5.4.p blockquote  pNothing here actually causes the codeeofcode bit to be set. Yes, extraction stops if it hits the endoffile, but it doesnt set the bit. In fact, the codeeofcode bit should only be set if we do another codess gtgt resultcode, because when the codesentrycode attempts to gobble up whitespace, the following situation will occurp  blockquote   pIf codeis.rdbufgtsbumpccode or codeis.rdbufgtsgetccode returns codetraitseofcode, the function calls codesetstatefailbit  eofbitcodep blockquote  pHowever, this is definitely not happening yet because the codefailbitcode isnt being set.p  pThe consequence of the codeeofcode bit being set is that the only reason the evilidiom codewhile stream.eofcode doesnt work when reading files is because of the extra codencode at the end and emnotem because the codeeofcode bit isnt yet set. My compiler is happily setting the codeeofcode bit when the extraction stops at the end of file.p  pSo should this be happening Or did the standard mean to say that codesetstateeofbitcode should occurp  hr  pTo make it easier, the relevant sections of the standard arep  ul li21.4.8.9 Inserters and extractors [string.io]li li27.7.2.2 Formatted input functions [istream.formatted]li li27.7.2.1.3 Class codebasicistreamsentrycode [istreamsentry]li ul

Negative 8826 pI am using mongodump and mongorestore in a replicated shard cluster in MongoDB 2.2. to get a backup and restore it.p  pFirst, I use mongodump for creating the dump of all the system, then I drop a concrete collection and restore it using mongorestore with the output of mongodump. After that, the collection is correct the data it contains is correct and also the indexes, but the information about if this collection is sharded is lost. Before dropping it, the collection was sharded. After the restore, however, the collection was not sharded anymore.p  pI was wondering then if a way of keeping this information in backups exist. I was thinking that maybe sharded information for collection is kept in the admin database, but in the dump, admin folder is empty, and using show collections for this database I get nothing. Then I thought it could be kept in the metadata, but this would be strange, because I know that, in the metadata, the information about indexes is stored and indexes are correctly restored.p  pThen, I would like to know if it could be possible to keep this information using instead of mongodump  mongorestore, filesystem snapshots or maybe still using mongodump and mongorestore but stopping the system or locking writing. I dont thing this last option could be the reason, because I am not performing writing operations while restoring even not being locking it, but just to give ideas.p  pI also would like to know if anyone is completely sure about if it is the case that this feature is still not available in the current version. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 8826 pDue to a flaw in .NET Microsoft says its intended but I see it as a serious flaw If a user empties a combo box i.e. wants to blank out the value the selected value does not revert to null instead it keeps the last valid selected value, so when you save with a blank combobox it goes back to the original value.One workaround is to first choose a different option from the drop down, then blank it out and it will work properly.

Negative 8826 pCurrently I am using Klatt to create vowels and it was written and compiled with C a hrefhttpwww.cs.cmu.eduafscsprojectairepositoryaiareasspeechsystemsklatt relnofollowhttpwww.cs.cmu.eduafscsprojectairepositoryaiareasspeechsystemsklatta . I automatically create the vowels using a Python program by invoking terminal commands which outputs a .wav file. This wavefile is then read from the disk by the Python program. I was either looking at writing the Klatt code in Python or if it was easy to extend the Klatt code so it returns the .wav file to a numpy array I have access too. Any suggestions on how to do this or the best way to go about it. p

Negative 8826 pWe have a very specific need. We want to create a generic Java based registration system for Event organizers. So every Event organizer can define a custom form on our application, and then we collect the data from users for that particular event. p  pNow the input fields can change from Event to Event, so I was thinking to use some outofbox cloud solution. One obvious thing came to my mind was to use Google Forms. So for every event, if we can programmatically create a Google Form and get following 2 things 1 Embed link for that form 2 Access to corresponding data keeping Google Spreadsheet p  pWe can use the embed link to show the Registration form to users on Event page. And we can access the Google Spreadsheet to access the data that Users have been filling in the Registration form. p  pBut when I searched for it, I couldnt get a clear way to achieve this. There is some Google Documents List API, through which you can create Google documents programmatically, but I couldnt figure out, how to meet our needs through this API. p  pIt would be of great help, if somebody can guide us in this regard.

Communication is made with a DTO, which contains the clients request type and data objects needed for the queries.

Negative 8826 pIm building an app in phonegap. The app makes heavy use of javascript and has a content area that should be scrollable. However I also need to use the touchStart and touchEnd events.p  pThe problem is that, unless you use e.preventDefault on touchMovetouchStart, you will get the touchStart event only once and never again after that Not useful. If you do e.preventDefault on either of those two, native scrolling is disabled on mobile devices.p  pHow do I allow native scrolling while also listening to touchstart  touchendp  pFailing that, could I simulate native scrolling using touchmove Ive tried my hand at this myself, and the result of that was frankly terrible.p
Negative 8826 pI have an extremely simple setup that tests the rails3 codeActiveSupportNotificationscode.

Negative 8826 pFirstly i am new so any help is appreciated p  pHi there i have a set of values tgat represent the number of people in a postcodd on average. These are  pcode1  239, pcode2  245, pcode3 210 and pcode4 217 now comes the bit where i am stuck. I have assumed that the average for allpcode 220. p  pIs there a way to write a code in python such that i can compare each individual pcode to thetotal average. What i want to do exactly is say compare pcode1 to allpcode and if pcde1  is higherlower than allpcode display the average from pcode 1 and say that pcode1 is lower than allpcode ir higher than all p code. Id then like to repeat for all other pcodes  p  pId like to display on screen all the averages that are lower and all averages that are higher. p  pSo something like pcode 3 and 4 averages are lower than all pcode average and pcode 1 and 2 are higher than all p code. p  pIs it possible to create such a code because i have no idea howwhere to start p  pThanksp

Negative 8826 pIm experimenting with optimizing parser combinators in C. One possible optimization, when the serialized format matches the inmemory format, is to just do an unsafe memcpy of the data to be parsed over an instance or even many instances of the type.p  pI want to write code that determines if the inmemory format matches the serialized format, in order to dynamically determine if the optimization can be applied. Obviously this is an unsafe optimization and might not work for a whole bunch of subtle reasons. Im just experimenting, not planning to use this in production code.p  pI use the attribute a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.interopservices.structlayoutattribute.aspx relnofollow[StructLayoutLayoutKind.Sequential, Pack  1]a to force no padding and to force the inmemory order to match declaration order. I check for that attribute with reflection, but really all this confirms is no padding. I also need the order of the fields. I would strongly prefer to not have to manually specified a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenCAlibrarysystem.runtime.interopservices.fieldoffsetattribute28vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowFieldOffseta attributes for every field, since that would be very error prone.p  pI assumed I could use the order of fields returned by a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6ztex2dc.aspx relnofollowGetFieldsa, but the documentation explicitly calls out that the order is unspecified.p  pGiven that I am forcing the order of fields with the StructLayout attribute, is there a way to reflect on that orderingp  pemeditem Im fine with the restriction that all of the fields must be a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary75dwhxf7.aspx relnofollowblittablea.p

Negative 8826 pThis may get flagged as not a real question but Im really confused by where NuGet fits in with a WiX deployment which you can guess by the questions at the end...p  pstrongCurrent Situationstrongp  pOur TeamCity build creates the WiX Burn 3.6 installers for our WinForms products that are FTPd to our servers.

The package will not be required by 90 of our client installations due to the specific functionality in the package, so presumably will need its own msi.

Negative 8826 pFor some specific purpose, I need to install some fonts on the instances. It comes as no surprise when I choose StartUp Task to accomplish that goal.

Even if I wrap the invocation of the vbs into a cmd file, namely to put something like cscript B file.vbs, it wont run either.p  pSo Im concluding that there must be some issue regarding the communication between the script and the Windows Azure monitor.

Negative 8826 pIm trying to create a sorting technique that sorts a list of numbers. But what it does is that it compares two numbers, the first being the first number in the list, and the other number would be the index of 2supksup  1.p  precode2k  1  [1,3,7, 15, 31, 63...] codepre  pFor example, if I had a list code[1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 10, 8, 19]codep  pThe length of this list is 8. So the program should find a number in the 2supksup  1 list that is less than 8, in this case it will be 7.p  pSo now it will compare the first number in the random list 1 with the 7th number in the same list 19. if it is greater than the second number, it will swap positions.p  pAfter this step, it will continue on to 4 and the 7th number after that, but that doesnt exist, so now it should compare with the 3rd number after 4 because 3 is the next number in 2supksup  1.p  pSo it should compare 4 with 2 and swap if they are not in the right place. So this should go on and on until I reach 1 in 2supksup  1 in which the list will finally be sorted.p  pI need help getting started on this code.p  pSo far, Ive written a small code that makes the 2supksup  1 list but thats as far as Ive gotten.p  precodea  []  for i in range10     a.append2i1 1  printa codepre  pEXAMPLEp  pConsider sorting the sequence V  17,4,8,2,11,5,14,9,18,12,7,1. The skipping sequence 1, 3, 7, 15,  yields r7 as the biggest value which fits, so looking at V, the first sparse subsequence  17,9, so as we pass along V we produce 9,4,8,2,11,5,14,17,18,12,7,1 after the first swap, and 9,4,8,2,1,5,14,17,18,12,7,11 after using r7 completely. Using a3 the next smaller term in the skipping sequence, the first sparse subsequence  9,2,14,12, which when applied to V gives 2,4,8,9,1,5,12,17,18,14,7,11, and the remaining codea  3code sorts give 2,1,8,9,4,5,12,7,18,14,17,11, and then 2,1,5,9,4,8,12,7,11,14,17,18. Finally, with codea  1code, we get 1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,14,17,18.p  pYou might wonder, given that at the end we do a sort with no skips, why this might be any faster than simply doing that final step as the only step at the beginning. Think of it as a comb going through the sequence  notice that in the earlier steps were using course combs to get distant things in the right order, using progressively finer combs until at the end our finetuning is dealing with a nearlysorted sequence needing little adjustment.p  precodep  0 x  lenV finding out the length of V to find indexer in a for j in a for every element in a 1,3,7....     if x gt j if the length is greater than or equal to current checking value         p  j sets j as p  codepre  pSo that finds what distance it should compare the first number in the list with but now i need to write something that keeps doing that until the distance is out of range so it switches from 3 to 1 and then just checks the smaller distances until the list is sorted.p

Negative 8826 pI have installed sox with support for both mp3 and flac.p  pThe below command also successfully converts flac to mp3p  precodesox songfilesDaughterofEvil.flac songfilesDaughterofEvil.mp3 codepre  pMy problem is that the DaughterofEvil.mp3 is not 320 bit mp3. I tried to specify sampling rate of 44100. But that did not change the bit rate. It stays at 128kbps.p  pHow can I directly generate 320 bit mp3 file for above flac file.p  pI can convert 128 bit mp3 to 320 bit mp3 using LAME. But the quality is already lost in 128 bit mp3 file generated above. Hence I want it done in single step.p  pThanksp
Negative 8826 pI recently ran into a strange memory problem. Everytime I start MyActivity which launches MyService the memory usage of my app increases.

I found that MyService, MyServiceBinder and LocalServiceConnection cant get garbage collected, because they were still remaining in memory while all other instances had been released. MyService and LocalServiceConnection have living references to the MyServiceBinderobject. MyServiceBinder seems to have no path to gc roots.  The question is why this Binderobjects dont get garbage collected  Could it be that MyServiceBinder references MyService which in turn references MyServiceBinder Maybe  if such kind of loop does exist  therefore the MyServiceBinderobject cant get releasedp

Negative 8826 pI have a library which is used by a project I built.  One of the classes in the library uses itertools to generate an incrementing id currently starting from 1 every time it is instantiated.  Id like to be able to initialize where the incrementing starts in the library based on ids that are known in the main loop of the server daemon which uses the library.  This is so when I start and stop the daemon, the ids can pick up from where they left off.  The daemon can determine the correct starting point using an SQL query to the db backend, but I cant figure out how to pass it into the library to be used as a starting point.p  pFrom the library, currentlyp  precodeclass Thingobject     iditer  itertools.count1     def initself         self.id  self.iditer.next codepre  pId like to replace 1 with a variable that can be passed into the class on its first instantiation.

Negative 8826 pI am trying to find an analog to Seam 2 Factory paradigm in CDI. I have used factory annotated methods and factory definitions in components.xml extensively in the past projects. Generally I use them as a sort of Cache and when I know the cache is stale I remove the component from the context and the factory method will run again the next time the Factory is required. p  pFor instance, in a production application we have lists of available medications that gets updated yearly. This list is used extensively in the application so we cache it in memory using a Factory annotated Application scoped method. p  precodeFactoryscope  ScopeType.APPLICATION, autoCreate  true, value  meds public ListltMedicationsgt buildMedsList ....Do work to parse, index and build list  codepre  pOnce the new list is uploaded we simply remove the meds Object from the Application Context and then access it to be sure it is cachedp  precodeContexts.getApplicationContext.removemeds Component.getInstancemeds codepre  pThere are a LOT of listsobjects that behave similarly. Supplying everything from SelectItem lists for radio button groups to dialog message text and end user license text. All of which have lifetimes that are VERY long but are required to be updateable without restarting the application server. I also use this same technique with some session scoped variables which have an unknown lifespan May need to be refreshed dependant on user interactions.p  pSo far I see the CDI Producer which is very similar to a Factory but I cant see how it can be used in a similar way to how I was using the Seam 2 Equivalent without building a wrapper class for each factory. Also I dont see a way to remove things from the CDI contexts. Therefore, I cant have these arbitrarily long lived objects without some special scope that I invent.p  pI am totally new to CDI so I am probably missing some technique.p

Implementing in VS2010 Cp  pSimilar nearly identical questions have been asked and answered here on stackoverflow, but honestly I learned nothing from the responses.p  pI want to implement an AuthenticatUser call where a username and password is sent and an authentication key is returned.p  pGiven that this needs to be done with a GET, POST, PUT, OR DELETE, it seems the GET would be most appropriate.p  pSo perhaps GET mydomainmyserviceauthenticateusernamepasswordp  pI dont like this because the username and password is passed in the URI, but as I understand it is not a good idea to send a body in a GET.  So a POST or PUT would work, but that seems to diverge from the RESTFul philosophy. p  pQuestion 1 Is it OK to send sensitive data like password in the URL   The site will use SSL.p  pQuestion 2 In GETs when there are multiple parameters being passed, it seems like the URI concept would get a bit crazy, how are complex queries supposed to be handled RESTfully p  pQuestion 3 What is the preferred normal, most common method of authentication in a RESTful APIp
Negative 8826 pI have a VS 2012 solution that includes both an SSDT project sqlproj and an MVC Web Application.  Ive setup numerous profiles for deploying the web app and would now like to use dbdacfx or something else to deploy the dacpac produced by the SSDT project.  Ive tested the dacpac itself and it works flawlessly.  However, figuring out how to integrate the two is proving elusive.  Every example Ive seen for deploying incremental database changes with Web Deployment seems to want an instance of the database  how do I get it to use my existing dacpac insteadp  pHopefully Im asking the right question p  pThanksp

Negative 8826 pI am dealing with a structured grid.  I display it with patch and I just tried to add to the plot a text of the type m,n that indicates the indices of each node. I use the text function, and in the future Id like to plot the nodal values of the variables instead that are time varying, thats why the text function is inside the loop. I profiled the code and most of the time is spent in the drawnow, cla, and text functionsp  precodedrawnow                              7.882 s    51.7 textx,y,charINPUT,C...    4.348 s    28.5  cla                                  2.300 s    15.1 codepre  pI opened a thread here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19192263textfunctionveryslowbottleneckofmycodequotTextquot function very slow, bottleneck of my codea to understand if its possible to improve the performance of the text function or if any faster alternative is available. Here Id like to figure out why drawnow and cla are so slow.

Adding cla helped but still so slowp  pIt is only a 71 x 71 grid, if you increase the number of cells the code is basically stuck. Any suggestion to speed this up Note I use patch because I want to plot some grid quantities for each cell and I want to keep it general in case I move to an unstructured mesh with irregular polygons emthat moves in timesem, thats why its inside the time stepping.p  pEDIT I first thought patch was prettyfast, cause it was taking only few milliseconds, but as noted by grantnz in his comment below, its actually drawn when drawnow is called. If the line hpatch3  ... is commented in my code provided below, this is the timing with the profilerp  precode    textx,y,charINPUT,C..      4.539 s   58.4        cla                                   2.285 s   29.4      drawnow                               0.576 s    7.4 codepre  pTherefore now things go a bit bitter but still pretty slow. It looks like creating and drawing the patch takes about 7 secs, and about 8 secs for creating and drawing the text. The main difference is that with text the time is mainly spent in the function itself and in cla while for patch it is spent all with drawnow.

Negative 8826 pWe would like to develop a survey in which consenting participants would have to give us access to their list of checkins on Foursquare. Currently, we do so via a Foursquare app, but I do not seem to find a way to specify which permissions our application needs. p  pWhenever a user is asked to grant access to our app, he is informed that we will be able to post checkins on his behalf and do a bunch of other things. This will raise concerns and will likely lower the number of willing participants.p  pThe question would be whether there is a way to restrict the permissions of our app to what we actually need, i.e. the full list of checkins. As an alternative, we are considering befriending the user from a special account instead. However, does friendship guarantee that we can see all of his checkinsp

Now Im aware of Apache Solr, Apache Cassandra, and DSE search.p  pHowever, I do not want to use a costly and proprietary softwareDSE search.  The reason I do not want to use Apache Solr is because I dont want to deal with HA, sharding, and redundency for it.

Negative 8826 pWhen using java APNs, if using the same program to send messages to different applications, it is required to use different certificates.

Negative 8826 pIve been converting a number of nightly scheduled jobs to run one after the next by making a job of jobs. This is totally legit in Spring Batch as a Step can be defined with a reference to another job.p  pThe problem is some of the same child jobs are run on a schedule by Quartz, and they are nonrestartable. This means sometimes the job of jobs fails because it tries to start an already running job. This yields the much lovedp  precodeJobRestartException JobInstance already exists and is not restartable codepre  pMy question is whether this is a way to tell Spring Batch to wail until the referenced job is available and then run it. This is because the nightly workflow requires ABC. I understand that I can write my own custom job launcher to poll the JobRepository for the offending child jobs ExecutionStatus to complete, but I was hoping SB had already thought of this common problem.p  pstrongUpdatestrong, example of Job of Jobs for those who asked how it works.

Negative 8826 pThe basic need is to determine Object Managers name for current running task. Additional benefit would be if we could also get Task Id, Component Name in general, Component Group Name, Server Name and Enterprise Name.p  pActually there is a solution provided a hrefhttpsiebel.ittoolbox.comgroupstechnicalfunctionalsiebeldevlhowtogettheobjectmanagersnamethroughscriptplshelp487513 relnofollowherea, but it has serious limitations. As long as it uses Server Admin buscomps that are pure inmemory objects and does not support query by example, we have to iterate through all records.

Negative 8826 pI have a android layout in xml, and I have an image i placed using javaandroid code.

Does anyone know a solution or example for this The reason I am looking is because its a pain to add a button without using XML and eventually I want to have animations on the screen. Thanks,p

Negative 8826 pIm using Netbeans 8.0 to debug WordPress plugins using Xammp 1.8.3 for local development.p  pEverything works great independently, i.e. I can call up the Xampp info page via browser navigation to localhost. From there I can launch PhpMyAdmin, etc. and I dont encounter any problems.p  pI can also debug my plugin projects from within Netbeans and, again, no problems.p  pHowever, when Im debugging a project, any attempt to access the Xampp info page or PhpMyAdmin fails. If I launch PhpMyAdmin first, and then try to debug the project, PhpMyAdmin is bounced from its session and will not work again until Ive finished debugging. Also, in cases like this, the debugger will often switch from the project I am debugging to one of the files of whatever activity I was performing in PhpMyAdmin. For example, if I was monitoring MySQL performance, the debugger will load serverstatusmonitor.php and stop at the fist line, exactly as if was starting to debug that code instead.p  pIn other words, Netbeans seems to be trying to debug any calls to the server, and not just those from the project Im trying to debug.p  pTo counter this, I setup virtual hosts so that I can access Xampp via localhost and my project via a custom server name, but this has not fixed my problem.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanks,p  pWaynep

Negative 8826 pSo I have an application where Im considering moving from PyQt4 to PySide. In this application, I use code.uicode files pretty frequently, with the following usage patternp  precodeclass BaseGUIWidgetQWidget     def initself, parent  None, uifile  None                  param parent parent widget of this widget         param uifile path to UI file to load optional                  superBaseGUIWidget, self.initparent         if uifile is not None             uic.loadUiuifile, self codepre  pLets assume I have similar classes for codeQFramecode, codeQMainWindowcode, codeQGroupBoxcode, etc.p  pThis allows me to create python classes that use the data from the UI file, as well as any additional functionality I add manually in the code. Essentially, my codeBaseGUIWidgetcode class acts as if it was extending the class generated by the UI file. A lot of the functionality in the application is pretty reliant on this behavior.p  pHowever, from what I can tell, PySides codeQUIloadercode doesnt have a similar functionality. Instead of shimming the UI files contents into your class, it simply builds a widget from the UI file internally, then returns it, and you then embed it into your widget in a codelayoutcode like you would any other widget., I.Ep  precodeclass BaseGUIWidgetQWidget     def initself, parent  None, uifile  None                  param parent parent widget of this widget         param uifile path to UI file to load optional                  superBaseGUIWidget, self.initparent         self.setLayoutQVBoxLayout         if uifile is not None             loader  QUILoader             uifile  QFileuifile             uifile.openQFile.ReadOnly                             self.uiwidget  loader.loaduifile, self             self.layout.addWidgetself.uiwidget             uifile.close codepre  pThis is a pretty massive difference. If, for example, you wanted your UI file to contain a codeQMainWindowcode and your python class to still be an extension of codeQMainWindowcode so it acts like one to other classes, youd wind up with a codeQMainWindowcode inside a codeQMainWindowcode, which isnt what you want. It also means you have to do codewidget.uiwidget.XXXcode to access the widgets produced by the UI file.p  pIs there any way to make PySides stronguicstrong implementation act like PyQtsp

Negative 8826 pI have a JQuery 1.8 Datatable 1.10 with some fields which are inplace editable i.e. clicking on them creates an input element where new data can be typed to update the table. p  pIn IE8 but not in Chrome or Firefox, I do not have later IE versions, pressing codereturncode whilst in an editable field also seems to generate a click event to a button outside the table. This is unfortunate as this button opens a Bootstrap modal dialog.p  pWhy is this likely to be happening and what is the best way to solve it AFAICT there is no click handler for the input field there is a keyup handler which returns false to stop propagation. At the moment I am assuming this is some sort of issue involving how IE8 does events differently but I am not sure how it is getting to generate a click event on this button.p  pThe input event listener isp  precodesetupEventListeners function tableEditor     Listen for key presses to trigger any finalisation actions   this.element.onkeyup, function event    switch event.keyCode       return or enter keys     case  KEYCODEENTER       tableEditor.saveAndClose       break       esc key      case  KEYCODEESCAPE        tableEditor.revertAndClose        break             may be overkill as JQ does stopPropagation if false returned      event.stopPropagation      event.preventDefault  event.preventDefault  event.returnValue  false      return false         , codepre  pThe button event handler isp  precodetableId  addRow.clickfunction event      console.logAddRow click      modal opened here....  codepre

Negative 8826 pI have the following situation I get a list of items which should be sorted by the codeSortIdcode property.p  pI have implemented the codeIComparableltTgtcode interface in my ItemViewModels, so that I can use codeComparer.Defaultcode in my codeICollectionView.CustomSortcode property to apply the sorting without using reflection which codePropertySortDescriptioncode does.p  pNow, my problem is that the items sometimes do not have the codeSortIdcode property set because they should simply be sorted in the order they appear in the collection. However, instead of keeping the order, the items are displayed in reverse order or sometimes completely mixed  this seems to depend on the number of items.p  pIs there a way to avoid this behavior If I do not apply any sorting, the items appear in the correct order. However, I would have to dynamically turn the sorting on or off, depending on the items codeSortIdcode properties  which I do not like at all... Any other ideasp

If a 0 is entered, that means that that element does not occur after that rows element in the vector.p  pHow to achieve thisp  pMy first thought was to try and mimic some aspects of the question above.  To that end, I used a grepl function to turn the vector into four separate logical vectors indicating the presenceabsence of each element.p  precodexAltgreplA, x   TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE xBltgreplB, x   FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE xCltgreplB, x   FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE xDltgreplD, x   FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE codepre  pI then tried the Flodel function and the second function provided by GG using librarydata.table.p  pFor example, to compute the minimum distances from all As to a Dp  precodeflodel lt functionx, y    xw lt whichx   yw lt whichy   i lt findIntervalxw, yw, all.inside  TRUE   pminabsxw  yw[i], absxw  yw[i1L], na.rm  TRUE  flodelxA,xD  gt [1] 4 1 1 3     GGs data.table option wxA lt data.tablex  whichxA wxD lt data.tabley  whichxD, key  y wxD[wxA, absx  y, roll  nearest]      y V1 1 1  4 2 4  1 3 7  1 4 9  3 codepre  pBoth of these options find the minimum distance for all As to a D.  However, it is in ANY direction, not the FORWARD direction only.    GGs data.table option is on the surface more attractive to me as it returns data showing the position of each element the y column of the output which would make it easy to package into a nice summary table such as my desired output table above.p  pI have tried to work out alternative ways of using the roll argument in data.table, but I dont seem to manage this issue.p  pThanks for any suggestions.p

Negative 8826 pI am writing an app which displays several FFT graphs in real time. I have been doing the drawing using views, but this is starting to really eat my CPU power as UIViews draw their contents on the CPU. I am looking for a solution to draw the FFT graph which will move the operation from the CPU of the ipad to the GPU.p  pSo far the solutions that I have thought of seems to be either trying to use CALayers and making each data point in the graph 512 of them an individual layer, or trying to use OpenGL to draw my graph, which is wayyyyyy out of my depth.... I know this is a vague question, but I was hoping that someone here would have a more clever idea of how to draw my FFT graphs on the GPU and free up some processor power.p

Negative 8826 pI am new to parallel programming and I appreciate your help in understand how it works. This is a contrived example, where I want the result of an operation to be 50 in every cell of the matrix.p  pThe result depends on a value in an array at [index1]. This doesnt work so well in parallel programming, as values arent computed in order, and I get incorrect results every few cells.

Negative 8826 pSo I have a bit of a mindboggler on my hands thats refusing to bend. My objective is to log on a database every single time a page is visited. I have created on the c side code that logs this info and I know it works. What Im trying to do now is relatively straightfoward every time an item that is, a page is clicked on the home view list which acts as a shell for the SPA and doesnt change, send the page name to a function in Javascript which will in turn communicate to the Webmethod. The problem is, when the app starts, as it is a SPA, it collects all the divs see below and renders them and for some reason, it does not want to communicate and pass parameters into the javascript function, no matter where I put it Ive put it on a header, Ive put it underneath the html, etc. The onclick function works fine when test it separately, but in this application, it refuses to work.p  pIve also tried using body onloadPostName as well as window.onload on each of the pages to invoke the function but its also a blank.

Negative 8826 pI am trying to negate a bitmap image with some code written in C. p  ol lipWhen I run the code for the Lena image let me call it LenaImage1 the first time I get a black image LenaImage2. When I run the same code on the image I get back the original image LenaImage1. This implies that the code works correctly right  When I view and save as bitmap LenaImage2 using MATLAB I dont get the black image, meaning that I can see it as the complimented imageMATLAB returns the same output. pli lipAnd when I run the same C code on a second image MountainImage1 I get a really bad image MounainImage2, with lots of pseudo colouring but NOT the black image as the output.

Negative 8826 pWe are using two remote repositories on Bitbucket for the same project where one is the one with most developments taking place at this moment and more people having access to it. The other is just for our team and only the team members have access to it. Right now we are pulling only from the first repository and pushing to both of them.p  pOur issue with the second repository push only is the codeMAIN BRANCHcode there which I assume to be the active codeHEADcode currently set to some branch codebranchxcode which is not the master branch. However, this branch was recently merged to the master and then removed from the other remote repo. But attempts to push this change to the second remote is failing with this message code[remote rejected] branchx deletion of the current branch prohibitedcode. The git command I used for this is codegit push origin delete branchxcodep  pIs there any way I can move the remote codemain branchcode from branchx to master and then delete the branchx p  pI also have a tag question how can I change the name of a remote repo, such as change the name of the second repo from codeorigincode to codeorigin2codep

Negative 8826 pUsing Maven I want to create 1 a JAR file for my current project with the current version included in the file name, myprojectversion.jar, and 2 an overall artifact in tar.gzip format containing the projects JAR file and all dependency JARs in a lib directory and various driver scripts in a bin directory, but without the version number or an arbitrary ID in the name.  I have this working somewhat using the assembly plugin, in that if I use the below pom.xml and assembly.xml then when I run mvn package I can get a tar.gzip file with the JARs and scripts included as desired, however I dont seem to be able to get the namingversioning correct  either I get both the projects JAR file and the tar.gzip file with the version number or not depending on the buildfinalName used.  How can I specify these separately, and is it impossible to build the final artifact without an ID appended to the artifact name  For example Id like to have my projects JAR file be named myproject0.0.1SNAPSHOT.jar and the overall uber artifact be named myproject.tar.gz no version number or additional ID appended to the name.

Negative 8826 pRecently I have learned about multithreading library in c11. I consider such a situation that  there is a global variable int x0 and there are two separate threads run in two separate cores. Whether the two threads may be write to memory of x simultaneously  For example in thread1 let x0x0000, int thread2 let x0xffff, Could x be some invalidate value of 0x00ff p  pI have test it on x8664 linuxwindows with g clang msvc, the answer is no, the value of x is 0x0000 or 0xffff.

Negative 8826 pIf I have multicast group members 239.0.0.11000 and 239.0.0.12000, is it possible to send data from a source to these two members in a single multicast  Is there any C function available to send to both these sockets in a single call p  pEDITp  pThis is my scenario. I have n number of hosts. For simplicity lets take 5 hosts A, B, C, D and E are there. These hosts are listening on ports 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 respectively. Now say, A has children B and C, B has children D and E. C, D and E have no children. What I want to do is, grouping the children in a same multicast group, so that a parent can send data in a single transmission. Also, a child sends data to its parent using unicast message. Since, these nodes are already listening for unicast data on the mentioned ports, I am looking for a way to add these ports to a multicast group thereby avoiding  creation of a new socket in each host.p

Negative 8826 pIm finding this a bit odd.  I would expect each iteration of codeparselineARGF.readlinecode here to wait for input from STDIN.

Negative 8826 pstrongUnity 2Dstrongp  pI am working on a piece of code here where I instantiate x amount of clones of a GameObject Prefab. There are several cars that are spawned randomly to simulate traffic, each clone are then attached a few scripts one to control its AI, one to control collisions, and I want a 3rd one to destroy the car when it is out of bounds, or too far out of the game for us to see it anymore.p  pProblem is, I have no idea how to access the GameObject the script is currently attached to. I managed to find any GameObject I am colliding with from the OnCollisionEnter2D, but I have not found a way to find myself, or itself.p  pI know I have a rigidbody2D attached, as I can control the car without instantiating or adding any components.p  precodefunction FixedUpdate     Controls the velocity of the car rigidbody2D.angularVelocity  0  codepre  pAny clues on how I can delete the aforementioned GameObject including rigidbody2D and stoppingdeactivate all scripts attached to itp  pI think I can destroy the GameObject and everything attached to it with DestroyGameObject, just not sure how to set the GameObject correctly.p  pEdit Also, it would be highly beneficial to know the name of the Prefab used for that instance of the GameObject different Prefabs use the same scripts.p

Negative 8826 pI need to import data a list of sprite properties into an iOS8 application written in Swift. The data consists in one excel type file of 20 columns and around 10000 lines so one table with 20 fields and 10000 records in database terms, fields can be num, string or boolean. Some lines most of them wont have value for each column. This import has to be done very regularly during the development phase to update replace all in fact the data. p  pI wont need to do any change on this set of data in the app and I need to avoid to have this import triggered by the user. Ill just need to select small chunks of it 1 to 100 and load them in an array of dictionaries where keys will be column labels. But I need to be able to access the full set of data anytime not just a chunk when the app launch and nothing else after.p  pThe data cant be hard coded and managed directly into Xcode because they are generated by a relational database that creates the flat file I need to import.p  pIm wondering what is the best strategy to do this as Im new to Swift and iOS Id like to learn directly the best way to do it p  ul liShould I use Core Data and load everything into one entity, then fetch my subset of data when I need it li liShould I use a text file or any other format that I include somewhere and read from it when I need li liOr is there another smart and beautiful option li ul

I adjusted my code to cancel the SelectionKey in the if statement at the bottom of my codewhileiterator.hasNextcode loop, once the data has been read from the channel. p  pThis seems to have done the trick, now I get one message informing that there are no more bytes to read before the channel is closed, and things seem to run more smoothly overall. p  pHere is my code for what Ive done so far, am I correct in my thinking about how this should be implemented Am I cancelling the key at the correct point p  precodepublic class ServerRunnable implements Runnable       private int serverPort     private int queueLength      public ServerRunnableint serverPort, int queueLength          this.serverPort  serverPort         this.queueLength  queueLength            private boolean running     private ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel     private ByteBuffer buffer  ByteBuffer.allocate1024      Override     public void run          try              Selector selector  Selector.open              serverSocketChannel  ServerSocketChannel.open             serverSocketChannel.configureBlockingfalse             ServerSocket serverSocket  serverSocketChannel.socket             serverSocket.bindnew InetSocketAddressserverPort             System.out                     .printlnDeviceServerV0.2  Going to Listen for connections on port                               serverSocket.getLocalPort             running  true              SelectionKey serverAcceptKey  serverSocketChannel.register                     selector, SelectionKey.OPACCEPT             int count  0             while running                  int keyCount  selector.select                 System.out.printlnkeyCount   keyCount                 SetltSelectionKeygt selectedKeys  selector.selectedKeys                 Iterator keyIterator  selectedKeys.iterator                 while keyIterator.hasNext                      SelectionKey key  SelectionKey keyIterator.next                      if key.readyOps amp SelectionKey.OPACCEPT  SelectionKey.OPACCEPT                           ServerSocketChannel ssc  ServerSocketChannel key                                 .channel                         SocketChannel sc  ssc.accept                         sc.configureBlockingfalse                           Here we add the new connection to the selector                         SelectionKey newKey  sc.registerselector,                                 SelectionKey.OPREAD                          keyIterator.remove                       else if key.readyOps amp SelectionKey.OPREAD  SelectionKey.OPREAD                          SocketChannel sc  SocketChannel key.channel                           Going with this from the tutorial for now.

Negative 8826 pI am not sure how to go about coding this. So, I have a string called S and a pattern string called M. I want to delete all occurrences of M in S. But, when I delete one occurrence of M in S, I could possibly create another. For example, given the word aajjk and the pattern aj. After the first deletion, it would become ajk. In this new string, another occurrence of aj has come after the first deletion. The final string after all deletions would then be k. Could you give me some tips on how to approach this problem, some psuedocode would be helpful as I need practice in implementation. p

I eager load the codeShowcode in the query like sop  precodepublic function getPopularShowsamount  null      if amount          return thisgtepisodegtgroupByshowidgtorderByviews, descgtwithshowgtget          return thisgtepisodegtgroupByshowidgtorderByviews, descgtwithshowgtgetgttakeamount  codepre  pHowever, this obviously returns a collection of codeepisodescode and I want a collection of codeshowscode. Is there a smart way of doing thisp  pThe only way I can think of right now is doing an codearraymapcode and swap out the episode with the show.p
Negative 8826 pIm searching for gadgets for return oriented programming in the libc library. The conundrum that Ive run into is that the offset or relative address of similar gadgets vary in the libraries same version, 2.15 on two different systems  mine and a colleagues.p  pMy system specificationsp  precodeOS Ubuntu 12.10 Processor Intel i5 M480 Virtual OS Yes Libc version 2.15 codepre  pColleagues systems specificationsp  precodeOS Ubuntu 12.04 Processor Intel Core 2 Duo T6670 Virtual OS No Libc version 2.15 codepre  pThe following gadgetp  precodepop ecx  pop eax  codepre  phas two different relative addresses. On mine the address is code0xf2c60code and on my colleagues it is code0xf2d21code.p  pHowever this gadgetp  precodemov [eax] ecx  codepre  phas the same relative address on both systems  code0x2d71fcode.p  pI have two questions. p  ol lipIs libc compiled while the OS is being installed and so the two libraries vary a little because the systems they were compiled on are different Or are they two different versions of libc Im not ruling this out because the versions of Ubuntu are different  sorry if I sound ignorant but GCC does not bother reflecting the minor changes in the version codepli lipIve read that the relative address of a gadget can be found by going through the source and that the binary isnt required. How would one accomplish this Please do not point to the Hacking Blind paper. Ive already read it and they dont show a way to accomplish this, they instead show a way to guess the gadgets one by one. This will not be viable for demonstrations. Or this there a tool I can use to crosscompile libc if the answer to the first question is indeed system specification differencespli ol

Negative 8826 pI would like to replicate scroll views behavior when you pan the scroll view outside of its bounds, first it goes easy then tension raises towards zero.p  pThe motion itself is driven by user which roughly gives me time t, start point p0 and maybe target point p1 where I expect to move at constant rate  1 threshold. The time can be calculated from a difference of p0 and p1 since we dont have fixed duration for motion.p  pHow is it implemented in iOSp

Negative 8826 pI am creating a file editing system and would like to make a line based tell function instead of a byte based one. This function would be used inside of a with loop with the openfile call. This function is part of a class that hasp  precodeself.f  openself.file, a  self.file is a string that has the filename in it codepre  pThe following is the original function It also has a char setting if you wanted line and byte returnp  precodedef tellself, charFalse     t, lc  self.f.tell, 0     self.f.seek0     for line in self.f         if t gt lenline             t  lenline             lc  1         else             break     if char         return lc, t     return lc codepre  pThe problem Im having with this is that this returns an OSError and it has to do with how the system is iterating over the file but I dont understand the issue.

I mean the default interval is shown like this...p  precode000000.000 if the timedifference is lower than a day or month or year  1 day 000000.000 if the timedifference reaches days, but is lower than a month or a year  1 month 1 day 000000.000 if the timediffence reaches months, but is lower than a year  1 year 1 month 1 day 000000.000 if it reaches years, months, days  it evens uses plurarl cases years, mons, days when their values are greater than one. codepre  pAll these variations make difficult to any other app when SELECTing query this interval values as text to convert it to a proper time. So I would like postgresql to always show year, month n days, even if their value are 0 it could be even better if it could show the date part of the interval like this... 011130, adding zeros to the left side when values are less than tenp  pI know I can change the interval to text, using tochar but I really would like to avoid that, I would like some good fellow postgresql programmer to tell me if it is true that there is a way to tweak the Interval Output as is said in the postgresql documentation.p  pThanks Advanced.p  pPD two more links about the subject a hrefhttpsmy.vertica.comdocs7.1.xHTMLContentAuthoringSQLReferenceManualStatementsSETSETDATESTYLE.htm relnofollowhttpsmy.vertica.comdocs7.1.xHTMLContentAuthoringSQLReferenceManualStatementsSETSETDATESTYLE.htma a hrefhttpmy.vertica.comdocs6.1.xHTMLindex.htm13874.htm relnofollowhttpmy.vertica.comdocs6.1.xHTMLindex.htm13874.htmap

Negative 8826 pIve made a friend request system that basically, when strongUser1strong sends strongUser2strong a friend request, in strongUser1strongs row, strongUser1strong is stored in the column From and strongUser2strong is stored in the column To. There is also another column called Status which is automatically set to Pending, until its accepted or declined.p  pNow for strongUser2strong, I have a PFQuery that finds all friend requests rows where the current user is saved in To anywhere in the database. When strongUser2strong accepts the request, my Javascript PFCloud Code basically creates a relation for strongUser1strong with strongUser2strong in a column called Friends My ObjectiveC code creates the relation for strongUser2strong with strongUser1strong. Now this all works fine, except now, instead of the From, To and Status columns being in the same database, I have moved them to a different database called FriendRequests.p  pThe only problem I am having is changing my Javascript code. At the moment it can query the FriendRequest database and gather the To users, From users and Status strongBUTstrong I cant get it to create the relation between strongUser1strong and strongUser2strong as they are in the User database.p  pThis is the cloud code p  precodeParse.Cloud.defineaddFriendToFriendsRelation, functionrequest, response   Parse.Cloud.useMasterKey  var friendRequestId  request.params.friendRequest var query  new Parse.QueryFriendRequests query.getfriendRequestId,       success functionfriendRequest           var fromUser  friendRequest.getfrom          var toUser  friendRequest.getto          var relation  fromUser.relationfriends          relation.addtoUser           fromUser.savenull,               success function                   friendRequest.setstatus, accepted                 friendRequest.savenull,                       success function                           response.successsaved relation and updated friendRequest                     ,                       error functionerror                           response.errorError 1                                                     ,              error functionerror                response.errorError 2                              ,      error functionerror           response.errorError 3           codepre  pI am trying to set the codevar relation  fromUser.relationfriendscode and coderelation.addtocode to the codeUsercode database.p

Negative 8826 pThere is a certain library I use in my project. This library has an interface which has about 15 methods.p  pThe purpose of this interface is to make it possible to subscribe for some events that are generated in the library. A listener class in application can implement this interface and register itself as a listener in the library to receive events.p  pAll the methods in this interface are actually events. There can be listeners who only need to receive only one or two events from many events in the interface. Even though a listener is only interested in few events, listener has to implement all the methods when extending the interface.p  pSo I asked the developer of this library to add empty default implementations to the methods in the interface.p  pBut the library developer refuses to add default implementations, stating that it would violate java best practices and using default implementations in interface methods go against the purpose of interfaces.p  pBut, as I can understand, a method in this interface does not specify some action which an implementer of this interface should be capable of. A method in this interface rather defines an event which an implementer may be interested in. So I cant see a clear reason for not adding default implementations.p  pSo, is adding default implementations to this interface break the java best practicesp

Negative 8826 pIm a beginner, and I simply code for fun and make little simple projects. This month Im trying to make a horse racing game. This game is the first project that uses local storage, so Im not exactly familiar on how to code it. I got a basic understanding of it thanks to w3 schools and MDN, but theres still plenty of bugs. The one that bugs me the most is the name changing function. In my code, you can click a button, and a prompt will ask you for a new name for the horse. Then, the screen displays it, and the value is saved to a variable and local storage. However, when I reload the page, the name is not changed, and the screen still displays the default name. Is there any way to fix thisp  precodevar horse       energy false,     name false,     speed false,     money false,     busy false,     hayBale false,   these are my LS checks and loads... iflocalStorage.getItemenergy  false      localStorage.setItemenergy, 100  iflocalStorage.getItemname  false      localStorage.setItemname, Give your horse a name  iflocalStorage.getItemspeed  false      localStorage.setItemspeed, 0  iflocalStorage.getItembusy  false      localStorage.setItembusy, 0  iflocalStorage.getItemhayBale  false      localStorage.setItemhayBale, 0  iflocalStorage.getItemmoney  false      localStorage.setItemmoney, 0  horse.name  localStorage.getItemname horse.speed  parseFloatlocalStorage.getItemspeed, 10 horse.busy  parseIntlocalStorage.getItembusy, 10 horse.hayBale  parseIntlocalStorage.getItemhayBale, 10 horse.money  parseIntlocalStorage.getItemmoney, 10 horse.energy  parseIntlocalStorage.getItemenergy, 10  and this is my name changing function. horseName.clickfunction      var newName  promptWhat do you want to rename your horse to the name is changable at any time     ifnewName   ampamp newName  false          alertSuccess Your horse is now named   newName           document.getElementByIdhorseName.innerHTML  newName         horse.name  newName         localStorage.setItemname, newName      else          alertYou didnt enter a name       codepre

Negative 8826 pIve got a thirdparty application that uses MySQL as a backed.  The next version will have support for our backup system, but before we upgrade we would like to take a backup.  Catch 22  I am not a DBA, and our DBA staff isnt familiar with MySQL, so Im pretty much on my own.  Our server has lots of space and CPU cycles, so I would like to test the restore on that machine, without overwriting the production data.  So my question is, should I install another instance of MySQL on the same computer in a different location, or is there a way to restore my data to an alternate database on the existing serverp
Negative 8826 pI have a GWT app that works fine on IE8 . I need it to run on IE11 so I upgraded smartgwt to version 5 and I added gecko18 as a user agent. Im facing some problems. The app works on IE11 but its behaviour is different and I just dont know why because the code  give me the result I want when I run it on IE8. For example I have some select items, I choose the values I want and when I click on a button it returns data from the database . But now it seems like it doesnt consider one of the my select items . p
