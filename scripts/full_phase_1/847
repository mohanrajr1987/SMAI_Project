Positive 847 pI was wondering if there was a way to force load the bootstrap.css or identify why it isnt loading on certain pages. the Bootstrap JS file is loading without a problem on all pages. Specifically, the CSS file doesnt seem to load with the ACYMailing Frontend module or Chronoforms. Could this be some sort of conflict Any suggestion on how this can be rectified would be most appreciated. Regards Donnap

Positive 847 pI am working with the Joomla Rocket Theme template Camber. It has a horizontal split menu system. Virtually a horizontal dropline menu that only goes 2 levels. It then splits off to a side menu. This side menu is a module that you allocate to any position via the Gantry admin panel.p  pI have 2 problems I would appreciate any assistance withp  ol lipThe Menu Title It has 4 suffixes that control the look of the Menu Title. I would like to add a 5th suffix to remove the Menu entirely. I would simply like to know if anyone knows where or which css file I can amend to either remove the titleheader, so I just have menu items and not a headertitle, or how I can add the necessary code to include an additional suffix that removes the header. The same as the Joomla module parameter to allow you ShowHide the Title.pli lipIn addition, I would ideally like to change the css to allow me run another or 3rd horizontal level if possible. Any help would be appreciated. pli ol  pThe problem is in the RT template code, not Joomla.  If I created a Joomla module I could easily remove the header in the ShowHide module parameters. Because the Split off from the main menu to a sub navigation or sub menu is automated in the gantry code, there is no actual side menu module as such. It appears on the website as a module, but there is no module in the admin module listing. Therefore I have no access to any parameters to change.p  pI have added a link to show the menu headertitle I would like to remove nachalministries.orghomefinance . It is the Finance Menu submenu title I would like to remove the TitleHeader, so the submenu appears more like an horizontal dropline menu item. Thanks again for any help and assistance if possible.p  pKind Regards Mikep

Positive 847 pI have a joomla site and would like to integrate some old unfinished webcomics to it, so I can pick them up where I stopped in a CMS that wont leave me in an absolute frothing rage thanks, wordpress.p  pIve got some experience with Joomla and I believe it would be a pretty good platform for managing multiple comics... except for the small issue of emhorridem navigation between pagesarticles. Joomlas integrated article navigation is a humble but passable start, but if you intend to use categories to organize chapters then getting from the end of one to the beginning of the next is... yeah. This is a pity, as Joomlas category and article management options are beautiful for archiving and presentation, and adding gantry 5 to it means a great deal of control over the reading experience. Basically, joomla has pretty much everything I want, except for the navigation.p  pIdeally, what Id like to be able to accomplish for comic navigation in joomla isp  ul liClickable fullarticleimage leading to next articlepageli liPrevnext article buttons already availableli liPrevnext category buttons do we have thoseli liThe latter two in a module I can choose where to publish optionalli ul  pAnd this is it, basically. I understand that implementing the first could be very hard without some major template customization, in which case Id be willing to insert the image as a link in the article body... but only if there was one single code I could use, like the one that generates the emnextem category article button. Because Im not willing to create hundreds of menu items to generate links pagebypage.p  pSo is any of this doablep

Negative 847 pIm starting to step into unfamiliar territory with regards to performance improvement and our RIA Rich Internet Application built with GWT. For those unfamiliar with GWT, essentially when deployed its just pure JavaScript. Were interfacing with the server side using a RESTstyle XML web service via XMLHttpRequest.p  pOur XML is unmarshalled into JavaScript objects and used within the application to represent the data model behind the interface. When changes occur, the model is updated and marshalled back to XML and sent back to the server.p  pIve learned the number one rule of performance in terms of user experience is to make as few requests as possible. Obviously this brings up the possibility of caching. Caching is great for static data but things get tricky in a multiuser system where data on the server may be changing. Also, use of LastModified and IfModifiedSince requests dont quite do enough since wed like to avoid unnecessary requests altogether.p  pIm trying to figure out if caching data in the browser is even right for us before researching the approaches. I hope someone has tread this path before. Im looking for similar approaches, lessons learned, things to avoid, etc.p  pIm happy to provide more specific info if needed...p

Negative 847 pIm really concerned about the aesthetic aspect of my web app and thats why Im asking this sort of a silly question. Forgive me in advance if you think its not that much a big deal. p  pIm building a desktop like web app and using jqGrid awesome plugin to show some tabular data. In desktop applications like iTunes, the table has enough empty rows to fill its dimensions. I mean if you set table grid to be 500px in hight and it only has one row the table zebra will continue to the end of page. This is something that I want to have but can not accomplish right now using javascript or css. p  pMy first idea was to make background image to the table that fake the empty rows but there are two problems for this method. First it will not work if the user zoom and make the text bigger and second Im showing some borders between columns that are realizable which makes it impossible to replicate them in background image. p  pDoes anyone have ever tried to make such kind of table grid  Any idea how to do itp
Negative 847 pI am trying to make my java application more standards compliant and one of the biggest issues i am facing is transitioning our ORM framework from Castor JDO to a JPA implementation thinking either Hibernate or DataNucleus. We have our own persistent data abstraction layer so the basic refactoring can easily be done by adding a JPA implementation to our API and creating the mapping. Then it becomes more complicated, we use Castor OQL, not heavily but not insignificantly, and that is not abstracted. We also make raw JDBC queries directly to the database, but go through Castor to get the connection. We are using ehcache to cache our objects between several servers.p  pQuestionsp  p1 In general, are there any significant differences in how Castor and JPA treat perstent objects that I should be aware ofp  p2 Does the JPA query language offer similar features as Castors OQL or will I need to look into JDOp  p3 Can I use ecache with any JPA implementationsp  p4 Any one know of a tool that can convert from Castor mapping to JPA mappingp  pfinally, I guess, any thoughts on the strengths of different JPA implementations  Hibernate is attractive because it is so widely used, but my biggest concern is simplicity so perhaps DataNucleas, EclipseLink or something else might serve me betterp  pthanks,p  ppeter cowanp
Negative 847 pMy previous post about this issue didnt got too many answers and it was kinda specific and hard to understand. I think Ive managed to understand the problem better and I now believe it to be a Vista issue...p  pThe problem lies on all types of fixed border styles like FixedDialog, Fixed3D, FixedSingle and FixedToolWindow. It does not happen on the sizable ones. This problem, like I said, it also happens only on Vista.p  pLets say you have a form with any of the fixed border styles and set the starting location to 0,0. What you want here is for the form to be snapped to the top left corner of the screen. This works just fine if the form border style is one of the sizable options, if its fixed, well, the form will be a little bit outside of the screen working area both to the left and top.p  pWhats more strange about this is that the form location does not change, it sill is 0,0, but a few pixels of the form are still drawn outside of the working screen area.p  pI tested this on XP and it didnt happen, the problem is Vista specific. On XP, the only difference was the border size that change a bit between any of the styles. But the form was always perfectly snapped to position 0,0.p  pIf possible, strongwithoutstrong finding how many pixels are being drawn outside of the working area and then add that to the form location, is there a possible way to fix or workaround thisp

Negative 847 pNot strictly a programming topic but input is appreciated.  Ive been developing a lot lately with YouTube APIs and I started with PHP code, using codeSimpleXMLcode, then actually skipped AJAX and went straight to using native JSON and doing everything clientside.  p  pWhile it feels faster, I wonder if its ready for primetime yet. Even with the multitude of frameworks, CSS limitations and variations in event propagation handling between browsers still make me wary of overusing Javascript in my applications. p  pOne disadvantage is actually that sometimes, JavaScript moves strongtoostrong fast, and without delays it is possible for it to feel jumpy. p  pThese are just my thoughts. I have actually not yet really delved into XHR as JSON just made so much sense, but I would be interested in knowing what seasoned programmers prefer and why.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pemTo be clear, I am talking about whether it is safe enough to userely on callbacks loaded after making calls directly to a JSON API JSONP or whether you really should rely on an insulatory serverside layerXHR between you and a thirdparty API, if nothing else  for caching purposesemp

Negative 847 pI have a component an assembly built in .net that i need to access on almost every request to two different websites. One website is written in classic asp and the other one in asp.net mvc.p  pAt the moment i reference the assembly in the asp.net solution and call it like i would any .net assembly. On the classic asp website, i call it through a COM wrapper.p  pThis is all good, except now i need this component to actually stay alive and monitor changes to a configuration file. In my asp.net website i could keep a refence in the application scope and i guess i could register it in component services for the asp access.p  pIs this the best way to do it Also, this way the component would actually be hosted twice  one instance in the asp.net application scope and one in the component services. I could perhaps instead only have it live in component services, and then instead reference it from asp.net.p  pI dont know  something smells fishy and no, its not me  am i on the right track or do you see better alternativesp
Negative 847 pI realize this is probably a fundamental thing I should know but I am selfteaching myself C and asp.net so I am a little lost at this point.p  pI right now have 2 pages.  One is an .aspx with aspx.cs file included that is blank and html is generated for it from a PageLoad function in the cs file.  The HTML is very simple and it is just an image and some text.p  pThe second file is a shtml file which has lots of things, serverside includes, editable and noneditable areas.  I want to put my webapp into this file.  My asp.net app uses Response.Write to just write out the html.  This does not flow well with this page as all that does is write it at the top of the page which is because it is ran first and generates it at the top.p  pHow can I make it to where I can generate HTML code inside the page, like within a specific DIV so it does not mess up the page.  Where would a starting point be in learning how to do that.p  pI should note that I do not need any interaction from the user.  All of this should generate right away.p

The obvious drawback is that if program crashes and while it is running, the plain text DB is accessible.p  pIs there a better way to approach this Can I pass an encrypted stream to the wrapper instead of using SQLiteConnection.CreateFile p  p[edit] Maybe I am overthinking this. Is is sufficient to use Password option in the connection string Would the file be encrypted properly in that case or is it some weaker protectionp

Each line in these Text Files is a Record. Each line can further be parsed into some DB ColumnsStock NameDate of purchaseOwner.... It is not necessary that each line has all the fields. If some text is not mathcing any of the fields, I store it as it is in a seperate columncolumnA. If the parser fails to find any column at all I just store the Line in columnA.p  pI than do a DB search based on user Inputs. I find that the search becomes slow after a few million records.

Negative 847 pI have implemented an iterative algorithm, where each iteration involves a preorder tree traversal sometimes called downwards accumulation followed by a postorder tree traversal upwards accumulation.  Each visit to each node involves calculating and storing information to be used for the next visit either in the subsequent postorder traversal, or the subsequent iteration.  p  pDuring the preorder traversal, each node can be processed independently as long as all nodes between it and the root have already been processed.  After processing, each node needs to pass a tuple specifically, two floats to each of its children.  On the postorder traversal, each node can be processed independently as long as all of its subtrees if any have already been processed.  After processing, each node needs to pass a single float to its parent.p  pThe structure of the trees is static and unchanged during the algorithm.  However, during the course of the downward traversal, if the two floats being passed both become zero, the entire subtree under this node does not need to be processed, and the upwards traversal for this node can begin.  The subtree must be preserved, because the passed floats on subsequent iterations may become nonzero at this node and traversals would resume.p  pThe intensity of computation at each node is the same across the tree.  The computation at each node is trivial  Just a few sums and multiplydivides on a list of numbers with length equal to the number of children at the node.p  pThe trees being processed are unbalanced a typical node would have 2 leaves plus 06 additional child nodes.  So, simply partitioning the tree into a set of relatively balanced subtrees is nonobvious to me.  Further, the trees are designed to consume all available RAM the bigger tree that I can process, the better.p  pMy serial implementation attains on the order of 1000 iterations per second on just my little test trees with the real trees, I expect it might slow by an order of magnitude or more.  Given that the algorithm requires at least 100 million iterations possibly up to a billion to reach an acceptable result, Id like to parallelize the algorithm to take advantage of multiple cores.  I have zero experience with parallel programming.  p  pWhat is the recommended pattern for parallelization given the nature of my algorithmp

Negative 847 pTo build a composite application view in my application, with different regions, untill now, Ive always used content presenter and used DataBinding to set its content.p  pIf I wanted to change its content, I would just have to use an event aggregator, publish a emViewZoneChangedEventem, subscribe to it in the shell window, and update the viewmodel accordingly so that the new data would be available for the binding and the UI be updated.p  pNow, I recently came accross those Regions in Prism, actually I hade seen them for a while but I didnt feel confortable with them, but since Prism is some kind best practices guidance maybe Im missing something  Let me explain why I feel unconfrotable.p  pwith my old way of doing, there is no coupling with the XAML. you never mention any specific magic string that should be present in the xaml, and I think thats essential, since the style can change.p  pIf at least the regions would berform a compiletime check of the region names  check it really exists somewhere  that would enforce using valid region names and be very helpful when refactoring, but as far as I know, theres no such thing. Some people use enums and the tostring method of an enum to convert it to a string and use it as a region name, but again, as far as I know, theres no real routine to check if the string typed really is valid and show an error when compiling the way it is done for Brushes.InValidColor for instance.p  pSo, my question is the following  what do the prism regions bring to the table compared to plain old binding plus eventAggregator if you wish to communicate across ViewModels p  pand are my assumptions true about the compiletime verification of the region names p

Negative 847 pIm using the Codeigniter framework and have tried to stick with the MVC philosophy as best I can. Ive recently run into an issue that Im not entirely sure how to handle.p  pI have a PHP script running that takes a fairly long time creating an index for my search engine.  What I want to do is have the html show up as its running.p  pIf I just put echo statements into my controller, and echo every time a document is indexed, it does what I want.  I can watch the progress as it happens.p  pBut that doesnt correspond with an MVC philosophy, and I also dont get any of the nice styles and html formatting that is set up for my view classes.p  pThe only way I know to interact with my view is to run the code in the controller, and store the log info into a variable, then pass it to the view when Im done. But that means I just sit waiting for ages, and finally a big log display shows up nicely formatted, mind you.p  pDoes anyone know how to do what it is Im trying to achieve  Use a View, but before the Controller is done yetp

Negative 847 pIm trying to make a sort of PHP bot. The idea is to have to php files, named a.php and b.php. a.php does something, then sleeps 30 seconds, calls b.php, b.php ends the Http request, does some processing, and then calls a.php, which ends the Http request, and so on.p  pOnly problem now is how to end the Http reqest, made using cURL. Ive tried this code belowp  precodeltphp obendclean headerConnection close ignoreuserabort  optional obstart echo Text the user will see size  obgetlength headerContentLength size obendflush      Will not work flush             Unless both are called    At this point, the browser has closed connection to the web server   Do processing here echoText user will never see codepre  pSlight problem is that it doesnt work, and I actually see Text user will never see. Ive tried cron jobs and such, but host doesnt allow it. I cant sent the script timeout limit either. So my only option is to create repeating php scripts. So how would I send the Http requestp

Negative 847 pThe objective is to get an array of MemberExpressions from two LambdaExpressions.  The first is convertible to a MethodCallExpression that returns the instance of an object codeExpressionltFuncltTgtgtcode.  The second Lambda expression would take the result of the compiled first expression and return a nested member codeExpressionltFuncltT,TMembergtgtcode.  We can assume that the second Lambda expression will only make calls to nested properties, but may do several of these calls.p  pSo, the signature of the method I am trying to create is  p  pcodeMemberExpression[] GetMemberExpressionArrayltT,TValuegtExpressionltFuncltTgtgt instanceExpression, ExpressionltFuncltT,TValuegtgt nestedMemberExpressioncodep  pwhere codenestedMemberExpressioncode will be assumed to take an argument of the form p  pcodeparent gt parent.ChildProperty.GrandChildPropertycodep  pand the resulting array represents the MemberAccess from codeparentcode to codeChildPropertycode and from the value of codeChildPropertycode to codeGrandChildPropertycode.  p  pI have already returned the last codeMemberExpressioncode using the following extension method.p  precodepublic static MemberExpression GetMemberExpressionltT, TValuegtExpressionltFuncltT, TValuegtgt expression      if expression  null              return null          if expression.Body is MemberExpression              return MemberExpressionexpression.Body          if expression.Body is UnaryExpression              var operand  UnaryExpressionexpression.Body.Operand         if operand is MemberExpression                      return MemberExpressionoperand                  if operand is MethodCallExpression                      return MethodCallExpressionoperand.Object as MemberExpression                   return null   codepre  pNow, I know there are several ways to accomplish this.  The most immediately intuitive to me would be to loop through the code.Expressioncode property to get the first expression and capture references to each MemberExpression along the way.  This may be the best way to do it, but it may not.  I am not extraordinarily familiar with the performance costs I get from using expressions like this.  I know a MemberExpression has a MemberInfo and that reflection is supposed to hurt performance.  p  pIve tried to search for information on expressions, but my resources have been very limited in what Ive found.  p  pI would appreciate any advice on how to accomplish this task and this type of task, in general with optimal performance and reliability. p

Then I went into machine.config in the .NET 2.0 area and cleared out the SQLexpress entry and the providers 3 of them.  Still no dice.p  pI want to try and solve the root problem without rebooting the database server.p  pNote that pages that access the database but not the profile work just fine.

Negative 847 pI am using a 3 layer hierarchy of QGLWidgets to share shaders and vertex data between 5 OpenGL viewports in my CADlike app.  The root context is used for compiling applicationwide shaders, the per document context is used to share model vertex data, and the viewport contexts are the ones that actually do the rendering and also contain grid vertex data and other per viewport stuff.p  pThe shader sharing seems to work fine, and so does the grid drawing, but when it comes to sharing vertex data it fails and to be honest  I cannot see how it is supposed to work...p  pI built a 3D icon for an item whilst the model context was current, as it was the first VAO it had a name of 1.  When I come to draw the object, the viewport context which is shared with the model context remember is current, so VAO 1 is called but its the emviewportsem VAO 1 that is drawn  my nice red grid centre line.  The OpenGL contexts can be shared but how can you specify the namespace each item belongs to as the names are not uniquep  pI tried making the model context current just before the model VAO calls, but the proper VAO nor the viewport one are drawn, I think switching context during a QPainterbeginNativePainting block does not make OpenGL happy.p  pThis seems a very basic thing to me so I must be doing something stupid  any suggestionsp

Unfortunately, I cant get the return false to execute.p  pHere is my current codep  precodefunction validate     var email  input.email.value     var emailRE  ....2,5     if email.matchemailRE         alertThis is true      else          alertThis isnt true.          return false  codepre  pWhen I execute this, the page reloads and the form submits, and neither alert goes off. However, when I take out the whole if, else section, the return false executes, and the page doesnt reload. I also tried taking out just the .match, and the code executed fine. So what is wrong with the .match part thats causing it to failp  pAny help is extremely appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 847 pI have developed a VoIP media server which exchanges RTP packets with remote SIP endpoints. It needs to scale well  and while I was initially concerned that my C implementation would not come close to the C version it replaces, I have used various profilers to hone the implementation and performance is pretty close.p  pI have elimitated most object allocations by creating pools of reusable objects, I am using ReceiveFromAsync and SendToAsync to sendreceive datagrams, and I am using producerconsumer queues to pass RTP packets around the system.

However, the iterative profiletweakprofile has me hooked  and I am sure there is more efficiency in there somewherep  pThe event that triggers processing is the Completed delegate being called on an SocketAsyncEventArgs  which in turn sends the RTP packets through the processing pipeline.p  pThe remaining frustration is that there seems to be significant overhead in the IOCP threadpool.

Negative 847 pHere is the situation I need to deal with. I appreciate any kind of input. There is a tennis court all wired with sensors. The net, the lines all have builtin sensors. All these sensors are sending signals to a USB device which is connected to a laptop computerCOMP1. There are also 2 projector screens in the court for the spectators. Projectors are connected to a separate computerCOMP2 and they can act as external monitors. I want to develop an eventdriven application and run it on COMP1 which will be monitoring the sensors. When it gets a signal, it would send a message to COMP2 which then displays the info on the projectors in a web browser. Both computers are wifi enabled. How would you design such a system Would you use ajax , web services, wcf, javascript Obviously, it will have a server COMP1 and a client COMP2. I dont want to run a timer on COMP2 to poll the sensors. I want it pure eventdriven. Sensor  COMP1  COMP2  screenp  pThanks for your help, in advance.p

Negative 847 pmy first question on stackoverflow and Im hoping its not a stupid one. p  pBasically all my datadriven tests look like this onep  precode[TestMethod] [DataSourceTestsDataSource] public void TestWithSomeFancyName     if myIsThisTestIgnored return ... codepre  pDataSource attribute  app.config connectionstring  excel odbc driver  excel datadriven tests.p  pcodemyIsThisTestIgnoredcode is set in the code[TestInitialize]code method for every datarow there is a separate test with separate code[TestInitialize]code, via codeTestContext.DataRow[Ignore]code, so I can ignore tests via some truefalse in an excel sheet. p  pstrongNow my problem isstrong just returning from a test method lets the test pass. How to not let the ignored tests pass in the MSTEST testrunner and in the CI via msbuild, or even better, do not show them at allp  pOn our Ci Build, it sums up every ignored a.k.a passed test, as the count of test is codedatarows x numbercode of testmethods, giving a faulty impression of the number of tests that ran. But, until now, I found no way to just set the test result to ignored or any other state than passesfailed programmatically.p  pBesides, getting rid of this annoying ignore line in every test and enhancing the assert messages without wrapping every assert in some function would be nice, too.p  pSo the bestonly approach to this, I thought, would be AOP style programming and using custom attributes. I found this old post about enhancing your mstest code with custom attributes, good read a hrefhttpcallumhibbert.blogspot.com200801extendingmstest.html relnofollowhttpcallumhibbert.blogspot.com200801extendingmstest.htmlap  pSpecifically the last comment in the linked article got me thinking, as the guy not just made my day by showing how to access all test state data to the attribute the MarshalObject stuff, but somehow he got it working, quoting him emIn this manner, I can determine whether or not to run a test based on a matrix of data driven information from the text context using the DataSource attribute, and the new custom attributes I created. em. strongYeah.. but how to do thatstrongp  pI took some of the code and implemeted it, looking something like thatp  precodepublic class MyCustomAspect  TestAspectltMyCustomAttributegt, IMessageSink, ITestAspect  ....      [SecurityPermissionSecurityAction.LinkDemand, Flags  SecurityPermissionFlag.Infrastructure]     public IMessage SyncProcessMessageIMessage msg             ....        see last comment in linked article to how to get this MarshalObject       MyTestsClass testClass  MyTestsClassMarshalObject        iftestClass.myTestInitializeRan ampamp testClass.myIsThisTestIgnored                 what to do here I would like to get rid of the SyncProcessMessage invocation, but...          return msg or null gt Exception The method was called with a Message of an unexpected type.          constructing a IMessage in an easy way specifically CallMessage seems not possible, and I have no clue how to construct a valid CallMessage that says ignore test              else                IMessage message  nextSink.SyncProcessMessagemsg         return message        codepre  pAgain I want to suppress the testrun for this datarow, or set the testresult somehow to ignoreunknown.p  pDoing anything with the returned codemessagecode or codemsgcode seems pointless, as the codeIMessagecode Interface just exposes the codePropertiescode Dictionary which has only some MethodName and stuff in it, nothing interesting it seems. p  pCasting codeIMessagecode to concrete implementations doesnt work they are all internal to System.Runtime. Though one can cast to ResultMessage and it returns something  null when an exception was raised so you can take the exception message and adjust error message via new throw.p  pAny Ideas And many thanks for reading so far. p
Negative 847 pI am working with a HUGE code base, developed by a LOT of people. The code contains code for, lets say, multiple targets. I am working on Target L. Target specific codes are in individual directories. p  pDuring compile time, based on certain flags, the code is selectively compiled. No problems at all. p  pHowever, when I am working with the code for target L, and when I try to resolve  follow a function or a variable or a literal or anything, sometimes eclipse leads me to the declaration  function from a different target. p  pEx I follow a variable xyz and it opens up the declaration from target S instead of the target of my interest, L. Per my description above, xyz will appear in code sections of multiple target specific code.p  pI guess it is going to the first or last declaration it found when building the index. My guess is, its taking me to the last declaration it found when building index.p  pMy question is, can I exclude certain directories from the eclipse code indexp  pI tried excluding the directories from my working set, but that didnt help.p  pThanksp

Negative 847 pIm trying to develop a Firefox extensionaddon that needs access to the SSL Certificate information of the page that is currently loaded.  Once I have this information I plan on modifying the contents of the page based on the SSL information.  Though, before I get there I first need to get the SSL info.p  pThe approach outlined a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgEnHowtocheckthesecuritystateofanXMLHTTPRequestoverSSL relnofollow titlehereherea makes a separate XMLHTTPRequest to get the security certificate.  I would rather not do that if I could avoid it because it presents a security problem.  p  pFor example, a malicious sitemaninthemiddle could provide one certificate on the first request for the page which the browser would verify and then provide another certificate for the XMLHTTPRequest that my extension would make.  This would result in the extension modifying site contents based on inconsistent information.  Hence, Id like to get the SSL Cert information that the browser itself used when verifying the site.p  pWith that in mind I combined the above approach with the method outlined in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1695440alteringhttpresponsesinfirefoxextensionAltering HTTP Responses in Firefox Extensiona to intercept all the HTTP responses by adding an observer of the httponexamineresponse event.

Negative 847 pOkay, not so much a programming problem, but I can only seem to think of really complicated methods to solve this.p  pThere is a script we run in the office. We need to determine how long this script takes only in working hours working hours being 9am  5pm. For example, lets say the script is started on Monday at 2pm, and finishes on Tuesday at 4pm. This script has taken 26 hours to complete, but only 10 hours to complete. This script can finish in a single working day, but can also span over many days. The script can only start and end in a working day. The timestamping is done with Unix format.p  pI do not have a clue how this could be done in SQL, but I know the network admin would prefer this.p  pThe serverside scripting language is PHP. So this would be the second option available. My attempt is belowp  precodeworkingDay  24 workingDayHours  8 workingTime  0  whiletimeTaken gt workingDay    workingTime  workingDayHours   timeTaken  workingDay  workingTime  timeTaken codepre  pI cant really think properly right now, too much work on, so although this method is dumb, it seems to work in this scenario since the timeTaken will always be lt 8   24.p  pAnyways, would be great to see a better and smarter method perhaps one that would work with any number of hours. SQL would be great to see too.p

Negative 847 pHeres one thing I havent seen explicitly addressed in C expression template programming in order to avoid building unnecessary temporaries through creating trees of inlinable templated objects that only get collapsed at the assignment operator. Suppose for the illustration were modeling 1D sequences of values, with elementwise application of arithmetic operators like , , etc. Call the basic class for fullycreated sequences Seq which holds a fixedlength list of doubles for the sake of concreteness and consider the following illustrative pseudoCcode.p  precodevoid fSeq ampa,Seq ampb,Seq ampc,Seq ampd,Seq ampe     AType ta2babc  question is about what AType can be     Seq fdt     Seq geet     do something with f and g  codepre  pwhere there are expression templated overloads for , etc, elsewhere. For the line defining tp  ul lipI can implement this code if I make AType be Seq, but then Ive created this full intermediate variable when I dont need it except in how it enables computation of f and g. But at least its only calculated once.pli lipI can also implement this making AType be the appropriate templated expression type, so that a full Seq isnt created at the commented line, but consumed chunkbychunk in f and g. But then the same computation involved in creating every particular chunk will be repeated in both f and g. I suppose in theory an incredibly smart compiler might realise the same computation is being done twice and CSEit, but I dont think any do and I wouldnt want to rely on an optimiser always being able to spot the opportunities.pli ul  pMy understanding is that theres no clever code rewriting andor usage of templates that allow each chunk of t to be calculated only once emandem for t to be calculated chunkwise rather than all at oncep  pI can vaguely imagine AType could be some kind of object that contains both an expression template type and a cached value that gets written after its evaluated the first time, but that doesnt seem to help with the need to synchronise the two implicit loops in the assignments to f and g.p  pIn googling, I have come across one Masters thesis on another subject that mentions in passing that manual common subexpression elimination should be avoided with expression templates, but Id like to find a more authoritative its not possible or a heres how to do it.p  pThe closest stackoverflow question is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1666176intermediateresultsusingexpressiontemplatesIntermediate results using expression templatesa which seems to be about the typenaming issue rather than the efficiency issue in creating a full intermediate.p

However when I run it on an actual device, SQLite Database Browser cant read it.  To extrapolate, the copy is being created just fine on the SD card, but when I copy to my PC from my device and view it, I get nothing, SDB cant understand it or something.  However when I use an emulator, I can copy it off using DDMS and view all the tables just fine with SDB.p  pUsing WinMerge to compare the two raw database files one generated by the device, one generated by the emulator both running the same code I can see there are formatting differences, but nothing that looks corrupted, but Im not 100 sure.  The android metadata and SQL sequence tables appear to be in there albeit in different orders, as well as my custom table.p  pDo you guys have any suggestions on how to debug this  Im not sure where to start since it seems to work perfectly on the emulator.  Also, Ive run the emulator at the same android release 2.3.3 as the device, so Im am empretty sureem they are using the same SQLite engine.p  pThanks, Mattp

Negative 847 pI have custom frameworks in my app bundle for WebKit, WebCore, and JavaScriptCore.  I would like all other frameworks that depend on the system versions of WebKit, WebCore, or JavaScriptCore to use my custom versions also.  For instance my custom version of Webkit loads private system frameworks that in turn depend on the system version of WebKit.  This means both my WebKit and the system WebKit get loaded, and usually a crash happens shortly after.p  pThe way I understand this should be done, is to set the DYLDFRAMEWORKPATH environmental variable before your app bundle begins execution Search order for loading frameworks can be found here a hrefhttpcode.google.compmacdependencywikiSearchPaths relnofollowhttpcode.google.compmacdependencywikiSearchPathsa.  You can set environmental variables in code with setenv, but it wont take effect for the currently running process.  I would have to relaunch the process again for it to take effect.  I would like to avoid this too.p  pSo my question is what is the best way to set the DYLDFRAMEWORKPATH before the execution of the my app bundle  This has to work in a release app bundle too.  Is there a way to run a script whenever someone clicks on my app bundle before the executable starts running.  Or is there any other suggestions out therep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 847 pI am trying to create a program that can import a postgres database table into excel via VBA, let someone make edits, and then export the edited data as a new table into the database via VBA. p  pThis would be a relatively simple although procedurally convoluted task to accomplish if the process did not have to work with both windows and mac versions of office. p  pMy original plan was to simply have the users download python and then install the psycopg driver. I would then store a python script as a string in a vba module which would write the python script to a file, pass an SQL string to the python script and have python grab the data directly from the database. Python would then split out a file, which would cause a VBA loop, waiting for the file to exist, to terminate and then import the data and fill a spreadhsheet. p  pWriting would simply entail the same process except that excel would export the sheet containing data to be uploaded to postgres before calling the script.p  pUnfortunately having a user install psycopg2 on a mac would be leave the leave them in state of misery, as the package cannot be simply downloaded and installed without downloading a massive 1 GB package known as xcode and then installing mac ports just to be able to run a simple python script to connect to postgres and even this doesnt actually work Needless to say, this is simply unacceptable.p  pMy programming experience comes mostly from creating scripts to run on local machines, so I am not really sure how I would accomplish this. p  pThe easiest way I could think of is to set up some kind of python based server on the ubuntu machine that houses postgres and somehow allow the local python scripts generated by the excel workbooks to send it streams of data which the script would then upload to the postgres database. For export from the database to excel, the local python script would send commands to the python based server which would then upload the data to an ftp server. Subsequently,the local python script would donwload this data, process it, and output it to a file, allowing excel to access it. p  pBasically, I just need a solution that allows a python program, executed from a users machine, to connect to the postgres housing machine and tell it to run a script that either generates a file for download or somehow streams the data back directly into the users python program without requiring the user to download any external programs. p  pI have begun the process of learning the basics of java, so if java allows for an easier way of accomplishing this task, I would be very willing  to try it out. As of the date of this post I have only been programming in java for 1.5 days though... so please keep that in mind when answering.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 847 pI have two forms. First one is to decide numbers of button by using jslider. Second form is to display jbuttons according to jslider value. When i click jbutton2, the second form shows and display buttons. It is working perfectly. However, I want to create jbutton on the second form without clicking jbutton2 in the first form.  Instead, when I change jslider, it should create jbuttons on the second form at the run time and once i change jslider it should create that amount of button again on the second form and refreshing  the second form button numbers according to jslider value.  I have tried revalidate, repaint but they do not work, they dont refresh the second form. p  pSo, How can I refresh second form when the jslider ,that is on the first form, changes  Please help..... p  pEditI am using default Jframe of netbeans....  p  p   To change this template, choose Tools  Templates   and open the template in the editor.  p  precodepublic class NewJFrame7 extends javax.swing.JFrame               Creates new form NewJFrame7           public NewJFrame7          initComponents                  This method is called from within the constructor to initialize the form.

Negative 847 pI need a hand with something I use a shared secret to prevent HTTP request forgery for a form. So basically, the serverside generates a random unique key that get placed in a hidden input and a session variable which are compared one to the other on submit. The shared secret gets changed on every refresh or submit.p  pIt all works fine.p  pNow, if the user has JavaScript enabled, I want to use Ajax. How should a new shared secret be passed to the form to replace the old value in the hidden inputp  pI was thinking that the serverside file that does the processing could return the new key in plain text and JavaScript could grab it and updated the hidden inputs value.p  pI am unsure how safe doing that is.p  pIf you have a bit of good advice, please let me know.p  pThank you.p

Negative 847 pA bit of context first I am writing a clientserver game in Scala first person shooterlike, where the client needs to send movement intentions to the server a few dozen times per second and the server sends entity states back, in realtime as well. There is physical simulation of these entities using JBullet on both the client for graphical fluidity and server side. Whenever a client receives updates from the server, it replaces its local states with the ones the server sent. There may be many clients on the same server at a given moment, of course. In short, in this application communication happens often, with small packets.p  pAt the moment, I am using Akkas actors to naively send Scala case classes over the network to the server and back.

Perhaps a system of functions like this would help solve the problem of having to copypaste sql code into the migration files.p

Negative 847 pI have an youtube video playing in a specific frame. After researching a lot and not being able to properly destroy the player when exiting the frame, I decided to put a SoundMixer.stopAll in all frames that can be used to get out from the youtube one. That makes things right in most of cases, because to access the video again I must click a button that reloads the player and everything gets back to the start. But I have some thumbs on the right side of the page that when clicked open a large image, occupying most of the page and not showing the video button, but they have a close button themselves. When I click the close button that movieclip becomes invisible and the one with the youtube video becomes visible again whats great in all other cases. The point is the player kept playing in the background and when I close the image you can see it playing again, but without sound. The only way to make the sound audible again is clicking on the seek bar because it isnt a flash component itself, differently of the playpause button or going to another frame that not one from the thumbsimages and coming back. How could I make the sound play again automatically when entering the frame Help to destroy the player when exiting the frame is also welcome.p

Negative 847 pDue to our requirements, we will have views and usecases that are deployment specific. Deployments will have generic and deployment specific parts beans. This means that we would probaly need one context.xml file that would contain the generic beans for all deployments, and then deployment specific deploymentContext.xml for each deployment. This means that some POJOs exists in one deplyment, but not the other.p  pMy questions 1 is it possible to have deployment specific context files to extend the generic context file 2 is it possible to describe a class in the deployment specific context file, that already exists in the generic context file I.e. It would override the bean described in the generic context file, as in class inheritance. 3 is the approach described above feasible, or should the build descriptor instead dynamically generate the context.xml file I would prefer the extension approach... 4 if I deploy all deployment specific contexts, but remove some of the POJO classes from the src directory, will the application break upon deployment or only after I try to instantiate the bean that does not existp  pThanks a lotp

For the moment I can tell them to use the middle click button to undo instead of right click and this works, but it is moot if they dont have a button with a scroll wheelmiddle click button.

Negative 847 pI have implemented google maps in my application. I have written my own overlay class extending ItemizedOverlay to add overlays. Using the same overlay class, I also add an overlay to show my current location on the map.p  pThe onTouchEvent of this overlay class is used to determine where the touch was made and be able to move the overlay object to anywhere on the map. This however, is causing some problem. The pointer to my current location also becomes movable. I want to fix this current location pointer.p  pFor this, i am creating a new class MyNewLocationOverLay which extends my previously created custom overlay.

Negative 847 pI have been making a Web UI to look into very large up to 10,000150,000 lines txt files. I have been using Ruby on Rails to do this and the interface I have has come along well enough. I am currently running into a problem related to the large size of these files. Currently, when a user selects a file to display, it reads the entire contents of that file line by line into a scrollable  element. p  pWith the large files, this causes the website to hang a little until it finishes and hang even longer if the user wants to choose a new file this confuses me a bit more, maybe I need to flush the  element of its contents first or something. p  pDo you see a way to speed up user experience My only thoughts are loading only part of the file at a time. The most convenient way I see this implemented is just to read more of the file to the div when the user scrolls close to the bottom of the file. I am not really sure this is a good solution because of how the website hangs when switching files.p  pAn ideal solution might be to load only the visible part of the file to the div at a time, but I am unsure how I would accomplish this. p  pAny suggestions p

Why cant I wait for one minute until my poll loop receives data from the server Why cant codebrowser.waitcode wait for timers that may fire repeatedly What do I need to do to implement my testp

Negative 847 pI am working on a way to find the most popular likes in my friend network. Most popular in my friend network is defined as having the most number of likes by my friends.p  pSuppose each friend has an unique id and has a number of liked pages. So, given an array of such friends, I want to find the likes which is liked by the most number of friends, and emalsoem the friends who liked this thing. Essentially, I want to show something like Your friend X, Y amp Z likes this.p  pMy first solution is to use a Map for storing the reverse mapping likesetand a Priority Queue for finding the top N. Here is my algorithm using C STLp  precodemaplt like, setltfriendgt gt like2friendsMap for each friend    for each like      like2friendsMap[like].insertfriend populate the map      priorityqueuelt pairltlike, intgt gt pq for each like in like2friendsMap    int count  like2friendsMap[like].size no. of friends who like this or popularity   pq.pushlike, count count is the priority   maplt like, setltfriendgt gt result for i in 1 to N  N is how many popular items I want    result  pq.top  gives me the element with highest priority most popular like    pq.pop  codepre  pAs STL internally uses Red Black Tree for implementing map and minmax heap for priority queue, this approach seems pretty fast to me. But if I have 100s of friends and each have 100s of likes, the memory usage would be huge. Of course, instead of storing the whole objects, I should use friend id and like id for all calculations which would reduce memory usage a lot.p  pWhat other algorithm or data structure can be used to improve efficiency increase speed, reduce memory For some reason, I cant store the list of friends against each like, it must be computed in run time. I am developing this using C, so solutions using STL or boost would be even better. p

Negative 847 pIm working in Xcode 4.3.2  building for an app in iOS 5.p  pIve decided to use SBJson to parse streams of data from our server. Ive verified that Im receiving a valid JSON response from the server. My question concerns the design behind the classes SBJsonStreamParser and the SBJsonParser.p  pIt appears that in SBJsonParser the method objectWithData takes the data received from the JSON response and uses the SBJsonStreamParserAccumulator to append the stream of data into a single JSON document. Once the data stream is gathered into one object, it is then parsed by the parse method in SBJsonStreamParser. p  pIve run into several issues when requesting larger JSON documents. The size of the responses seem to be reasonable specially 9.4 KB response. It appears that the SBJsonStreamParser breaks when getting a data stream greater than a certain size. The parser succeeds when the response is small 3KB, but fails when the response is larger 10KB.  I used NSLog to verify that in both cases, pulling a small amp large stream, the methods  are successfully receiving the full json document  because it looks like [id .... 123]. Im convinced that the issue is that the data stream is too long.p  pIm wondering if Im using SBJson incorrectly or is this simply a limitation of the parser Is there anything that I can configure that allows SBJsonStreamParser to not throw an error for larger but reasonable data streams amp continue to parse the full responsep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 847 pFirst off I created my own theme from scratch. Ive been trying to figure this out all day yesterday. Ended up using a couple of twentyelevens and twentytens files just to accomplish this. Then deleted them cause there was no success. All I want to do is remove certain text such as Filed Under and Posted By that appears at the bottom of my single posts page. I want the Standard Single Posts Page to have the Meta Data, while the Gallery Single Posts Page doesnt have Meta Data.p  pI tried to use the loop.php, loopsingle.php, loopgallery.php, content.php method but nothing was working for me. Where can I start to get these two different post formats to display differently on their single pages Is there anything I need to add to my functions.php file just to make this work Do I need to recreate the loop files Please help...p

Negative 847 pfor my project I need to draw a vector around the whole globe connecting 2 points.

If I draw another string and swap the points, Ill get the same line going back from endpoint to startpoint. What I need is this new line connecting 2 points around the globe and with the longest distance, so I get a belt encircling Earth. Would appreciate any help, thanks.p

There are about 1000 total users.  It would be nice to be able to import the current members into Azure AD, but it will be OK if each user has to create a new login account.

Negative 847 pIs there a way in JavaScript to generate a downloadable PDF or any other file that can contain images and text I am working on a strange project that requires this functionality. The JavaScript is embedded in a locally stored webpage, I have complete control over the users environment. Is there a way to somehow run local processes with JavaScript if I configure local security settings one way or another Anyways, the reason I ask is as follows, here is my project and where I am sort of hung up on...p  pI have a script that walks a filesystem on a partition that a user selects when they run the script. The script then takes the list of all files and generates thumbnail files of all image files found from the filesystem walk. These thumbnails are then generated into an HTML page which is then opened by the script in firefox. I have JavaScript in the page generated by the script that allows the user to check and uncheck checkboxes next to each thumbnail. The goal being that once the user selects all of the images they are interested in, they can press a button to generate a report of the images they selected. I am not sure how to generate said report. I saw a question similar to mine answered with jsPDF but im not sure if thats the best solution for my situation I am just looking for ideas and suggestions I am open to learning other scripting methods if need be. A server side solution could be considered, but I would like to stay away from any local servers, etc etc like PHP and stuff..p

Negative 847 pSuppose I have a class Person with the following properties and methodsp  ul licodepublic string FirstNamecodeli licodepublic string LastNamecodeli licodepublic House CurrentHousecodeli licodepublic void BuildHousestring streetAddresscodeli ul  pHouse is a separate class with some simple properties like street address.p  pWhen I first create a codePersoncode object, I databind a WPF window to it.  Person starts out with a codeFirstNamecode and codeLastNamecode, but their codeCurrentHousecode is null.  This is a stupid example but for the sake of argument lets say the person has to build a house before they can live in it.  Databinding to codeFirstNamecode and codeLastNamecode works as expected.p  pNow lets say I want to move this person into a house.  The logic looks something likep  precodepublic void BuildHousestring streetAddress      this.CurrentHouse  new House              StreetAddress  streetAddress       codepre  pMy data context for the WPF window is this person object.  I have a label that shows the persons address bound to codeMyPerson.CurrentHouse.StreetAddresscode with an codeUpdateSourceTriggercode of codePropertyChangedcode.  When I first show the screen the codeCurrentHousecode object is null and the label is blank expected behavior.  However when I call codeBuildHouse123 anywhere stcode, I expect the databound label to have its value changed to 123 anywhere st.p  pThis is not whats happening and Im starting to suspect its because when the window is initially open, the CurrentHouse property for the databound codePersoncode object  is null.  Are my suspicions correct  If so, what do I need to do to enable databinding on the label once the CurrentHouse object is no longer null p

Why do we need a seperate flag in the VMCS virtual Macine control Structure when such a flag is already present in the architecture EFLAGp  pI read somewhere that, the reason for this is that guest can override VMMs hypervisor intention to single step if EFLAGS were used.  p  pAWhats the point of emulating hardware if you dont have control  p  pB I am facing a issue where I need to set BTF branch Trap FlagPG 689 vOLUME 3a INTEL sotfware manual.

There seems to be no direct way doing this like in the case of single stepping. Can anyone let me know If there some way to do the same thing using other means p  pThanksp

Negative 847 pIm using Pubnub to publish live messages from a Server to a client browser page. When using Pubnub, one must abide by their message size constraints, sometimes resulting in the need to chunk the message, send it in pieces, and reconstruct on the client side. Following Pubnubs advice, one can ensure delivery of each chunk of a message if the codePubnub.publishcode function is not called too quickly i.e. if the message pieces are simply being pumped through a for loop.p  pThe Pubnub Ruby API specifies 3 required arguments in a codePubnub.publishcode, a channel, a message, and a callback function. The callback function shown below is from Pubnubs Ruby examplesp  precode    mycallback  lambda  message putsmessage      pn.publishchannel gt helloworld,       message gt hi,       callback gt mycallback codepre  pThe emmessageem in the callback not the hi message in the publish, contains the status information of the codepublishcode call with values like sent and message to large, both of which would be accompanied by a unique identifier.p  pSo somewhere under the Pubnub hood, this callback is getting a code.callcode  Im wondering if there is a way for me to get inbetween this process. More detailed, say I have a message that needs to be broken up into three chunks, I would like for chunk 0 to be sent, and upon receipt of a sent status in the callback, I would like to then send chunk 1, etc...p  pIm not very familiar with lambda functions and their scopes, and this was my first attemptp  precode    mycallback  lambda  message                              putsmessage                              Rails.logger.debugSetting pubnubdosend to true from callback                             pubnubdosend  true                                 pubnubdosend  true      while pubnubmessage.nil       if pubnubdosend           Send pubnub message         Cut off first chunk of message this is why Im testing for nil         Set pubnubdosend to false          Rails.logger.debugMessage messageid chunk chunkid sent         pubnubdosend  false       end     end codepre  pThis resulted in an utter failure  getting the server completely locked into an infinite while loop because if I had to guess pubnubdosend was never set to true again. Looking at the debug log, I see the first message print Message 1 chunk 0 sent but never the output from the callback function. Probably because of the infinite while loop its found itself inp  pThere must be a clean way to do this, and Im ok with refactoring code to some extent, chunking up the messages and storing into an array first and then simply looping through the array to send, but I feel like the solution cant be far off, Im just not too handy with lambda functions and callbacks.p  pI feel like the solution should look likep  precode    mycallback  lambda  message                              putsmessage                              sendpubnubmessagemessageid, chunkid, chunk                                 def sendpubnubmessagemessageid, chunkid, chunk       Send pubnub message       Send messageid, next chunkid, and next chunk to mycallback     end codepre  pBut the problem is codemycallbackcode is called by Pubnub when the codePubnub.publishcode gets some status back about the message rather than me directly calling it Is there a way for me to insert messageid, chunkid, and chunk into the callback emwhileem still letting pubnub attach its message to the mix That sounds way wrong, but maybe with Ruby...p  pThanks in advance for all help.p

Negative 847 pWhen readingwriting to a context from emEntity Frameworkem I often read, that it is recommended to keep the contexts lifecycle as short as possible one context per unit of work. It makes a lot of sense to do that, however how am I supposed to write a unit test for a class that is creating and disposing this context in every methodp  pLets see a simplified fictional example code snippetp  precodepublic class Resource  IResource      public Item GetItemstring name          usingvar context  new DbContext              return context.Items.FirstOrDefaultitem gt item.Id  id                codepre  pIf I want to unittest the Resource, I would like to mock the DbContext, so it returns some fake data for me.p  pMy usual approach would be to make the DbContext a property of my class and inject it from outside like thisp  precodepublic class Resource  IResource      public DbContext Context  private get set       public Item GetItemstring name          return this.Context.Items.FirstOrDefaultitem gt item.Id  id       codepre  pThis way, the instanciating class which injects the context is responsible for the lifecycle and I can omit the using emandem I can inject a mocked context of course.p  pNow taking into consideration, that providing a long living context might be a bad idea and following the emone context per unit of workem principle, this option is not favourable.p  pSo what options do I have One idea is to inject a ContextFactory, which creates and disposes the context on demand like thisp  precodepublic class Resource  IResource      public DbContextFactory ContextFactory  private get set       public Item GetItemstring name          usingvar context  ContextFactory.CreateContext              return context.Items.FirstOrDefaultitem gt item.Id  id                codepre  pDoes this make sense or am I going into a completely wrong directon p

Made a mistake after looking at my database. I dont need to compare two different databases, while copying the operations database via phpmyadmin I forgot to load the current data into the analytics database.

Negative 847 pThis is a fairly basic question but I havent been able to find concrete answers online.  Every codehasmany belongstocode does not need nested routes correct  Should you only use nested routes when youre looking for URLs of the form codeclassidclassidcodep  pFor example, lets say I have two classes codeProfilecode and codePostcode.  p  pmodelsprofilep  precodehasmany posts codepre  pmodelspostp  precodebelongsto profile codepre  pTheres no separate codepostcode URL, the codepostscode are displayed in codeprofilesshowcode.  Should the codepostcode routes in this case it would be only actions like new, create, and destroy be nested inside the codeprofilescode resource The rails guide states that resources should not be nested more than one level deep and there are often times.  Making nested resources for every association seems like it would violate this rule very quickly.  Thanks in advancep
Negative 847 pThis is an odd one.  We recently found a 3month old bug in our code where we post a 302 redirect header after a printr.  As a result, the browser would receive the string, and not redirect to the next page.p  pThis printr had been in production for an exceptionally long period of time and no one has mentioned it, which led us to believe it was a config difference on production and development.

Negative 847 pHey so I am following the One Month Rails guide to learning Ruby and I have hit a wall on one of the lessons. I have just finished uploading an image with Paperclip, and as I finished my work on my localhost and checked it on Heroku, something went wrong. The pinimage appears to have been pushed to my Heroku account, the only problem is that the username and password that works for my localhost3000 wont work for my Heroku account. The same password should work for both, but for some reason something is wrong. I wish I could give you the action that is going on in my terminal, but the ruby rails is the only thing that has a continuous status flow. The problem may have been when I switched my password after not using my account on localhost for a few weeks, but i thought that once i git pushed that to heroku master, it wouldve synced. I have tried heroku run rake dbsetup which didnt seem to do too much as well as wrestled by way through Importing a Heroku Postgres Database with PG Backups, but I had some trouble working through that. Any ideas Thanks for the help. p

Negative 847 pId like to make a chatting program using win socket in cc. I am totally newbie. The first question is about how to check if the client receives packets from server. For instance, a server sends aaaa to a client.  And if the client doesnt receive packet aaaa, the server should resend the packet again.I think. However, I dont know how to check it out. Here is my thought blow. First case.p  pbrServer  aaaa  Client. brServer will be checking a sort of time waiting confirm msg from the client. brClient  I received it  Server. brServer wont resend the packet. p  pbrThe other case. brServer  aaaa  Client. brServer is waiting for client msg until time out brServer  aaaa  Client again.p  pBut these are probably inappropriate. Look at second case. Server is waiting a msg from client for a while. And if times out, server will resend a packet again.  In this case, client might receive the packet twice.p  pSecond question is how to send unlimited size packet. A book says packet should have a type, size, and msg. Following it, I can only send msg with the certain size. But i want to send msg like 1Mbytes or more.unlimitedp  pHow to do thatp  pAnyone have any good link or explain correct logic to me as easy as possible.p  pThanks.p

Negative 847 pI am on my 10 hour of trying to get my sqlite database to export to sdcard as a backup and then import information back to my application.   I have searched every topic I could to try and figure this out without having to ask any questions but now I have ran out of helpful info.   I seem to be very very close to finishing this... Heres where I am   I am following this basic example a hrefhttpandroidgenuine.comtagimportexportandroiddatabase relnofollowhttpandroidgenuine.comtagimportexportandroiddatabasea .   Everything seems to be working great and I can see the folder I created with my backup file and if I open the file as text I can see it is saving my information from my db.   I then import my saved file back to my application and everything seems to go well also.   The problem is the new information I load from my backup isnt displayed in my application, it still displays the same data as before the import.   The weird thing is if I export my database after importing it the export file is the correct data that was supposed to be displayed, so I am apparently getting the correct data when I import it just doesnt show up and instead shows whatever old data I had before import.   Again, it works however, just doesnt seem to refresh my data my application is reading.

Negative 847 pI have looked but the answers that people have given didnt help my problem. Rather confusion.  I am creating a small project for my website and i am trying to convert it to php for the pages and easier maint.p  pThe way i want it set up is like how i have it now. a hrefhttpsoloentertainment.org relnofollowSoloentertainment.orga But this is all html and each page is it own Html page and if i need to edit or add to the nav bar or anywhere else i have to go to each html and change it.

Negative 847 pI have a DIV and I use Jquery UI to make it draggable inside its parent. There are grids of 10px for its dragging movement. The problem is IE10 messes with the position of the DIV. For example, it returns 9.99999237060547 instead of 10 for the top property, which then prevents the draggable from being dragged to the first cell because it 9.99999lt10, and jqueryUI assumes that moving up will take the element out of its container.

Negative 847 pIm trying to understand where ARC is getting the method signature information to do its job. In the following code, I send a message to the parent of this object without specifying its class. If I dont typecast the parent ivar, the compiler issues a warning. If I typecast it to id, then the program works and no warnings are issued. The same is true if I use codeperformSelectorwithObjectcodep  pIf the method on the parent is different to codeuserSelectedcode then the only thing that works is codeperformSelectorcode while issuing a warning.p  pAs I understand it, ARC is getting the method signature from the object the call to self.parent is made. Is this correct Can you avoid telling ARC what class an object is if the method signature exists in the object from which the message is being sentp  precode voiduserSelectedidsender      if [self.parent respondsToSelectorselectoruserSelected]           1 This fails with error no visible interface.

Negative 847 pI need to build a command line tool, that will take a 3D model as an argument, and will output photos of it, that may or may not be processed by this application. The tool will be deployed on Linux, but I want to make it as crossplatform as possible.p  pThe program is not supposed to present a window of any kind, or accept any other input apart from the command line arguments.p  pI was wondering, how would someone approach this I am currently able to display the 3D model onscreen with the help of GLFW, which actually drives my event handlers to peripheral input, and also my main loop. However, I dont know if using GLFW will help me if I want to make a commandline program with inputoutput as files.p  pDoes anyone have any indications as to how to approach thisp

Negative 847 pemDisclaimerem Im not a realtime architectures expert, Id like only to throw a couple of personal considerations and evaluate what others would suggest or point out.p  pLets imagine wed like to design a realtime analytics system. Following, Lambda architecture Nathan Marzs definition, in order to serve the data we would need a batch processing layer i.e. Hadoop, continuously recomputing views from a dataset of all the data, and a socalled speed layer i.e. Storm that constantly processes a subset of the views made by the events coming in after the last full recomputation of the batch layer. You query your system by merging the results of the two together.p  pThe rationale behind this choice makes perfect sense to me, and its a combination of software engineering and systems engineering observations. Having a evergrowing master dataset of immutable timestamped emfactsem makes the system resilient to human errors in computing the views if you do an error, you just fix it and recompute them in the batch layer and enables the system to answer to virtually any query that would come up in the future. Also, such datastore would require to support only random reads and batch inserts, whereas the datastore for the speedrealtime part would require to support efficiently random reads and random writes, increasing its complexity.p  pMy objectiontrigger for a discussion about this is that, in certain scenarios, this approach might be an overkill. For the sake of discussion, assume we do a couple of simplificationsp  ul liLets assume that in our analytics system we can define beforehand an immutable set of usecasesqueries that hour system needs to be able to provide, and that they wont change in the future.li liLets assume that we have a limited amount of resources engineering power, infrastructure, etc to implement it. Storing the whole set of elementary events coming to our system, instead of already precomputing viewsaggregates, may just be too expensive.li liLets assume that the we succesfully minimize the impact of human mistakes ....li ul  pThe system would still need to be scalable and handle everincreasing traffic and data. Given these observations, Id like to know what would stop us from designing a emfully streamoriented architectureem. What I imagine is an architecture where the events i.e. page views are pushed inside a stream, that could be RabbitMQ  Storm or Amazon Kinesis, and where the consumers of such streams would directly update the needed views through random writesupdates to a NoSQL database i.e. MongoDB.p  pAt a first approximation, it looks to me that such architecture could scale horizontally. Storm can be clusterized, and Kinesis expected QoS could also be reserved upfront. More incoming events would mean more stream consumers, and as they are totally independent nothing stops us from adding more. Regarding the database, sharding it with a proper policy would let us distribute the increasing number of writes to an increasing number of shards. In order to avoid reads to be affected, each shard could have one or more readreplicas. In terms of reliability, Kinesis promises to reliabily store your messages for up to 24 hours, and a distributed RabbitMQ or whatever queue system of your choice with proper usage of acknowledges mechanisms could probably satisfy the same requirement.p  pAmazons documentation on Kinesis deliberately I believe avoids to lock you into a specific architectural solution, but my overall impression is that they would like to push developers to simplify the Lambda architecture and arrive to a fully stream based solution similar to the one Ive exposed. To be slighly more compliant to the Lambda architecture requirements, nothing stops us from having, in parallel with the consumers constantly updating our views, a set of consumers that process the incoming events and store them as atomic immutable units in a different datastore that could be used in the future to produce new views via Hadoop for instance or recompute faulty data.p  pstrikeWhats your opinion on this reasoningstrike Id like to know in which scenarios a purely streambased architecture would fail to scale up, and if you have any other observations, proscons of a Lambda architecture vs a streambased architecture.p

Negative 847 pThe android design guidelines specifically call out the right caret codegtcode as not being part of the UI. It shouldnt be used to prompt users to drill down into more information.p  pUnfortunately it doesnt give an alternative, only suggesting that everything is clickable and that android users should be used to exploring. This has diverged from reality and I need an alternative indicator for the right caret.p  pHas something else been standardized or developed I ask this with the idea that there is an actual answer or burgeoning best practice, otherwise I will implement a right caretp  pThe utility I need is to drill down to more information from a list item. Android doesnt slide menus or views from the left and right, by default, instead it pops up new activity and dialogs, so  may not make that much sense, I just need an equivalent indicator.p  pthanks for any insightp

Negative 847 pIm trying to write a small portion of a larger code that will ultimately input a struct and use the values inputted to do some volume calculations of a boat. Im trying to create a struct and then in my function at the moment I have no function and Im just calling it from my main, I want to give the struct values. As the eventual volume calculations are really long, Im trying to avoid using something like newboat.L1 every time I need to use the L1 value. To do this, Im using the following codep  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltmath.hgt  struct boat      double L1     double L2     double Lhull     double C     double delta     double mass     int main       make two people structures     struct boat newboat      double L1, L2, C      newboat.L1  L1     newboat.L2  L2     newboat.C  C      L1  17.6     L2  4     C  sqrtnewboat.L1newboat.L1  newboat.L2newboat.L2       printfnL1  lfn L2  lfn, C  lfn, L1, L2, C       return 0       codepre  pThe values Im trying to input for L1, L2, and C are not being passed into the structure and I wasnt sure exactly how to do that so these values will be saved and can be used and called later by their shorter names.

Examples would be FABULOUS as well.p  pThanks, Curtisp

Negative 847 pMy ASP.NET MVC application has a number of web servers accessing a SQL Server database via Entity Framework 6. The database has 2 tables, with a one to many relationship between them.p  pOnce a day, the entire contents of both tables needs to be replaced by a new dataset that is loaded over the Internet from a remote web service. The number of records may be in the tens out thousands. The records are not very big, with about 10 nvarchar and integer fields each.p  pIm planning to have one web server load the dataset from the remote web service into the 2 SQL Server tables. It would need to remove the old content and efficiently load the new content. While this is happening, the other web servers have to be prevented from accessing the tables probably by locking the tables.p  pIm looking for fast options to accomplish this, and their pros and cons. If there is a NuGet package or Entity Framework command that does this for me, that would be ideal.p

Negative 847 pThis is kind of a silly question, in that it is very trivial and yet confusing to find a straight answer on.p  pI have a series of custom validators for a form, all of which seem to be working appropriately.  I am writing in VB.net right now, for these.  p  pWhen the user clicks the submit button, I do this p  precodeProtected Sub SubmissionClickByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles SubmitButton.Click         Page.Validate         If Page.IsValid Then         ... Go on to accept the form.         End If End Sub codepre  pHere is the problem If a single one of my custom validators passes, then args.IsValid is set to true and thus in the above code, it goes straight into the If and on to submitting the form to the DB.  p  precodeProtected Sub AffidavitValidatorServerValidatesource As Object, args As System.Web.UI.WebControls.ServerValidateEventArgs Handles AffidavitValidator.ServerValidate     If Not AffidavitYes.Checked  True And Not AffidavitNo.Checked  True Then         args.IsValid  False     ElseIf AffidavitNo.Checked  True Then         args.IsValid  False     ElseIf AffidavitYes.Checked  True Then         args.IsValid  True     End If End Sub codepre  pSo for example, if they select Yes for this Yes or No on the page, then the form is automatically validated since args.IsValid  True, emeven if they do not even fill out any of the other fieldsem.  This is a big problem, because this is not at all the intended effect of having the multiple validators.  I want the form to be accepted only if emallem of the validators pass.p  pI need to make sure that should any strongemoneemstrong of the custom validator functions set args.IsValid  False, then the form should not be validated and thus not be accepted.p  pNow here is a little more info.  I set all of my custom validators to be in the same ValidationGroup, and I also set all of them to validate on empty that is, to still run their custom validation function even if the user never touched the control at all.  p  pI think because the Yes or No bullets are at the bottom of the page, they are the last to be validated in my SubmissionClick function. Thus, even though the other validators may be setting args.IsValid to false, since this last one is setting it to true, then the form is accepted.  However I dont really know how to rectify this in a succinct and effective manner.p

Negative 847 pI want to compose several traits across several modules. A function might require multiple such traits as its input, i.e.p  precodetype a xt  lt getx  int  .. gt as a constraint a  lt getb  float  .. gt val foo  xt gt float  codepre  pcomposing these traits manually in the interface is cumbersome and errorprone, but perfectly possible.p  pBut in an ideal world, I should be able to use the traits name instead of manually composing all the required fields, i.e. write something likep  precode type a xt  lt getx  int  .. gt as a constraint a lt at codepre  pUnfortunately, the OCaml syntax does not allow for this. This emseemsem to be a purely syntactical restriction, so I wonder whether there is a deeper reason for thisp  pIn other words Why cant I directly write subtype constraints in OCaml type signaturesp  pedit To clarify the usecase I have several sometimes interdependent modules which provide functionality on some common shared state. These modules shall be composable and loosely coupled i.e., the only require their part of the global state to fulfill their needs and thus, I can always extend the state with new functionality. To achive this, the state is encapsulated in an object which provides several lenses above I only used the getters, not the setters. Hence, if I provide interface definitions for my modules I need to describe the required lenses in the signature of my functions via constraints on the type parameter that encodes the whole state type. Now I am searching for a way to write these composed signature requirements as short and readable as possible. p
Negative 847 pI have an issue that I believe is related to the isolate scope of my directive.p  pThe AngularUI popup date picker will not appear again in the directive once a date has been selected from the popup.p  pOutside the directive, the pop up continues to function correctly even when a date has been selected.p  pFor demonstration purposes, Ive used the exact same markup and property for displaying the popup so that the two will influence each other. The same [broken] behaviour in the blob directive can be seen even if the popup and date picker outside the blob are removed.p  pBy having the same markup and codeisopencode property, we see the popup appear outside the blob when the calendar icon is clicked inside the blob, so the codeopencode function appears to be working correctly.

Negative 847 pIve been tasked to implement a very basic feature request for a Rails application Foreman, and have stumbled across an issue that seems to be both very basic and a very popular issue. Coming from a Java background, I find callbacks do not work as I would normally expect.p  pNormally in Java when listeners are used, you can subscribe arbitrary pieces of code to the event, and when the event fires the object iterates over the listeners and notifies each one. A very basic example would bep  precodepublic class Foo      private ListltFooListenergt foolist  new ListltFooListenergt     public void addfoolistenerFooListener fooListener         this.foolist.addfooListener          private void onfoothing         foreachfoo  foolist              fooListener.notify                codepre  pSo you can add however many listeners from external classes by calling addfoolistenerfooListener which will be notified when the onfoothing method is called  without any modification to the original class.p  pIs there anything similar in rubyrails The class I want to hook into has the following hooks defined p  precodedefinemodelcallbacks build, only gt after definemodelcallbacks provision, only gt before   Custom hooks will be executed aftercommit aftercommit buildhooks, if gt persisted  def buildhooks     return unless respondtoold ampamp old ampamp build  old.build     if build       runcallbacks build do         logger.debug  custom hook afterbuild on name will be executed if defined.        end     else       runcallbacks provision do         logger.debug  custom hook beforeprovision on name will be executed if defined.        end     end   end codepre
Negative 847 pMy goal is to add certain custom headers to every outgoing JSON response. To do this, created a class that extends from SetDefaultContentHeaders JsonMediaTypeFormatter, and overrode the SetDefaultContentHeaders method like sop  precodepublic override void SetDefaultContentHeadersType type, HttpContentHeaders headers, MediaTypeHeaderValue mediaType      base.SetDefaultContentHeaderstype, headers, mediaType     headers.AddXAnswer, 42     headers.AddXQuestion, Unknown  codepre  pI then prepended my derived media type formatter to the formatters listp  precodeconfig.Formatters.Insert0, new MyMediaTypeFormatter codepre  pAnd this solution seems to work for some requests, but not others. After some investigation, I discovered that if I include an Accept header in the request, the response does not contain my custom headers This was a bit surprising, because the response type still comes back applicationjson, suggesting either my formatter or the default json formatter is handling the response. The only thing I can think is that the code that calls codeSetDefaultContentHeaderscode is eminem the codeJsonMediaTypeFormattercode, and that codeSetDefaultContentHeaderscode is not virtual.p  pSo  what is going on here And what is the best ways to correct thisp

Negative 847 pIm wondering if there is a way to setup connection between a client and a server over the internet and have both of them programmatic setup all needed routerfirewall configuration changes to open needed external ports to communicate.p  pAssuming both server and client have known ip addresses and a DNS is not needed in this example to find the IP addresses. How might one have a server that when started configures access past the firewall and tells the router how to route proper communication to the server. I would assume the client may not need anything like this as it should only need to know the external IP address and port number of the server. If im wrong about my assumption please let me know.  p  pExample if i have two houses house A has a server and house B has a client and both sites know what the other house external IP address is and know what port they will be using how may a Java application do all the configuration or at least do as much as possible on say windows,mac,ubuntu. The idea is the user of the server and client should not have to do a bunch of firewallrouter configurations to get the application running. It would also be nice if in the example it shows how to release the connections when the server is terminated.

How can one change the img src, even before the page loads  The DOM does not actually exist for us to get the dom element for img element and change its src to the new image how can one do itp  pI was thinking may be have a inline script tag within the head section where the async is set to false which does not block the loading of the DOM. I am not sure. Please let me know if there are any other alternatives or html5 features for this p

I know I could save 1 operation by changing it to p  precodeint missingnumber  int  arr, int n       stdvectorltboolgt booVecn, false     int  offArrEnd  arr  n     while arr  offArrEnd booVec[arr]  true     stdvectorltboolgtiterator offBooEnd  booVec.end     return stdfindfirstofbooVec.begin, offBooEnd, false          offBooEnd  1         codepre  pBut Im wondering if using a similar procedure with codeunorderedmapcode might be faster overall I presume it would take longer to instantiate every member of an codeunorderedmapcode, but it might take faster to modify its elements. p

Negative 847 pSo I am interested in creating a custom nonlinear filter. My mask is a 3 by 3 matrix and what I want to do is take my center point and look at the values directly neighboring it excluding the diagonal elements. I want to subtract the middle element by each of those neighboringvalues and then find either the minimum of these values. Basically Im looking at elevation data and I want to find the smallest deltaZ to the middle point.p  pExamplep  pcodeZ  [64    21    31    59       38    30    92    26       81    47    43    60       53    23    18    71]codep  pSo lets say I was just looking at codeZ3,3code  43 for now. I would take 43 and subtract 92, 60, 18, and 47 yielding 49, 17, 25, and 4 respectively. Then I want it to only output 49. This process would repeat for every element in the Z matrix. How would I go about doing this Thanksp

Negative 847 pSo I have an app I am building using Steroids  appgyver, although not really relevant, with some real time elements chat rooms, private messages, etc which will utilise socket.io. The app itself is behind a login, using an existing http API that stores a token locally for the rest of the app requests.p  pI want to authenticate the socket.io bits using the same API, and token as the rest of the app. I have gone through hundreds of articles this morning covering these topics, but none seem to do exactly what I want, and seem overly complicated. They all seem to route the auth locally, or require username and password inputs, which I have already resolved and a token provided instead.p  pWhen a user connects to the server...p  pcodeio.onconnection, functionsocketcodep  p...or when the server receives a message from the users client...p  pcodesocket.onmessage, functionmsgcodep  pI want it to ensure only authenticated users can do this by sending the token. I have had a bit of a look at a hrefhttppassportjs.org relnofollowhttppassportjs.orga but cant see a strategy that works with tokens and APIs over http.p  pstrongSo how can I authenticate my socket.io app with my existing RESTful API and locally stored tokenstrongp

Negative 847 pI have found a very good Opensource Implementation of a GPU  BFS traversal of a graph from here. a hrefhttpscode.google.compback40computing relnofollowNvidia scalable graph traversal.ap  pThis code can either return a parent array or the distance array at each pass of the BFS,however I need both of them and I think its an overkill to run BFS again on the graph to obtain the distance array.p  pI wanted to know whether there exists any good algorithm to compute the distance array by just looking at the parent array itself.

Negative 847 pCurrently  have a div that has a height of 1000px, and if it goes higher then 1000px it has a overflowscroll. Now I have parts of that div that when hovered pop up information that overflows to the Y axis SHOULD go over the scroll bar. Yet the overflowing information just stops at the scroll bar, and it should go OVER the scroll bar. I have even set zindexs, but the overflowing text will not pass over the scroll bar. How could I fix this Thank You p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have tried much more on trying to fix this. When I remove overflowy scroll, it then flows out of the div which is good. Yet when I add the overflowy scroll the scroll bar stops text from passing it. So I do not know why this scroll bar is messing everything up.p

Negative 847 pIve got a vector layer with points representing customer locations and another vector layer with a line representing the coast line. I want to calculate a smart distance to coast. Specifically, I want to determine the shortest distance to the coastline within a specific range along a specific bearing.p  pFor example, suppose a customer is located on a peninsula. At 0 degrees the distance is 1 mile to coast and at 180 degrees the distance to coast is 3 miles. In this case, Im more interested in the distance at a bearing of 180 degrees. I run into many similar situations where the coastline weaves around so significantly that using a simple distance measurement yields unusable results for my purposes.p  pFor each customer, I would store the bearing in degrees that I am wanting to use in this measurement.p  pIdeally, Id like a function that allows me to find the shortest distance by specifying a bearing and a  range in degrees, i.e., mypoint.mindistancetolinealongbearingmyline, 180, 15 ... which, in a perfect world, would return the shortest distance to the line in a bearing that is between 165 and 195 degrees.p  pI am using QGIS 2.8 on a Windows 7 PC. I hope this makes sense. Thank you.p

Negative 847 pIn our business requirement, we need to transmit updates to a couple of thousands of clients, distributed across the country. Thing is, many of these clients connect to us using 3g network, so, many connectdisconnect occurs... The updates we need to deliver are things like Enterprise A can not be cashed anymore, or Enterprise B is able to be cashed again,     We were thinking in using ActiveMQ durable topics to deliver these updates. It is my understanding that once a client connects to a durable topic, even if he looses connection, whenever he gets back, he receives the messages sent to that topic while he was offline.    Big question is, what if a client starts our system, but messages were sent to the durable topic he is suscribing to, previous to his subscription. This case isp  pDurable Topic is createdbr Message 1 is sent to the Durable Topicbr Message 2 is sent to the Durable Topicbr Client A subscribes to Durable Topicbr Message 3 is sent to the Durable Topicbr Message 4 is sent to the Durable Topicbr Client A goes offlinebr Message 5 is sent to the Durable Topicbr Message 6 is sent to the Durable Topicbr Client A goes online  p  pAs per ActiveMQ papers, Client A will receive messages 3 to 6 with no problem. But what about Messages 1 and 2 We can not afford to loose those messages...p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 847 pI am trying to understand the delegates and events, so far I know the concepts.p  pI have a question in mind and want to know if I am right.p  pThere is a class Car. We create a public delegate CarHandler, then we create a private member of delegate type ListofMethods, then we create method for registering methods with this member RegistorMethods in this we say ListofMethodsincoming parameter.p  pThen, in main program we create methods with signature same as that of the delegatesignature is return type void and parameter is string. Then, we create object of Car class. Then we register the methodmethods with the delegate method is console.writelineincomming parameter. Then when we invoke this class. Now, based on where in the class the ListofMethods is invoked exampleListofMethodsHey There, accordingly the RegistoredMethods will fire.p  pSo the advantage of using events instead of above example is that  I know that we can create multiple events of the same delegate type with out creating more registration methods.p  pstrongCase 1 is using only delegates and no events. And case 2 is using events. Then, In case 1, all the registered methods would get the same text as invoked by ListofHandler. To create more events events here mean the general english meaning and not the c events in Case 1 we would need to create more delegate members, more methods for registering new methods with this delegate member. However, in Case of EVENTS case 2 the different events can give their own text and the instance can then register with the event it needs and it will get it fired.strong p  pstrongIn CASE 1 we would need to create more delegate members for raising multiple eventsnot C events, general English meaning, where as in case of CASE 2 events it is enough to create only 1 delegate member.

Negative 847 pI am trying to make the iOS slider as similar as possible to the Android one. One main difference is that on Android, if you click anywhere on the slider scale, the slider knob will jump to that position, while iOS it seems that you can only drag it to a position. Is there anyway to fix this I would like to do it using objectiveC which I am new to and Im not quite sure where to start. I understand the code used to store the slider value, but not how to change the method in which that value is obtained. p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

The service starts run 23 timesi can see the log in the handler, then stops without any error. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma202571222743818Herea they mentioned about a similar problem, but no solution.p  pI refreshed Google Play Services to 7.5, but not that is the source of the problem. Any suggestion is appreciatedp  pUpdate The suggested solution, to observe if the service runs, just a partial solution, i can restart listen the recognizer with startListening method, but its not listening at all. Im considering to use other recognition service, like sphinx. It is so embarrasing, when OS version changes and your app will be wrecked...  Im aware about the fact, this API is not intended to be used for continuous recognition  as mentioned in documentation.p

Negative 847 pSo this is what I have.br Have a function that returns loan exceptions.  So if someone has a missing document, thats an exception, or a signature required, thats an exception etc. The problem is that ALL of the information being returned by this function contains all of the information for the loan.  Including the amount. So if there are 6 exceptions on a single loan, and the loan is 1000, then totaling the amount by exceptions gives you 6000, because 1000 is stored in every record detail. So here is a similar set of records that I am returning.p  precodepoolDesc loanNumber Exception   Amount Consumer 123        Missing Sig 100 Consumer 123        Missing Doc 100 Consumer 123        Late Pymt   100 Estate   456        Address Ent 2000 Estate   456        Missing Doc 2000 Estate   789        Missing Sig 1000 Consumer 345        Missing Sig 500 codepre  pWhat I am looking for out of that selection isp  precodePOOL      CountExceptions LoanAmount Consumer  4               600 Estate    3               3000 codepre  pThere has to be a way to do this, and its going to an SSRS report if that helps.br Thanksp

Negative 847 pSo heres the story. At my company, you can access previous pay statements online via a payroll website. When you go to look at a statement, it will open the statement inbrowser via a pdf viewer. When working properly, it will usually ask if you want to blank out all the data or not which... why would you want to the point is to look at your statement. Now, this worked fine when checking it out in Adobe Reader youd just click yes, show data and everything displays fine, it can be printed, etc. But the company decided that instead of getting Acrobat for editing pdf files, that the better cheaper option is to get a cheapfree alternative called Nuance something or other. Two users installed this program, and now the browsers open pdfs inbrowser with Nuance instead of Adobe Reader. This is a problem, because Nuance doesnt show the option of hiding or showing data like Reader did rather, it just chooses the no option, which results in a blank template pdf coming up.p  pNow, this whole problem could be solved if we could just get the browsers to use Reader to open pdf files inbrowser... obviously its not a problem if you could download the pdf, but the site doesnt seem to allow you to download the pdf files. Weve tried just about everything we could think of, short of uninstalling Nuance altogether, to get IE or Chrome to open pdf files with Reader, but even with a full IE reset, it uses Nuance to open pdfs inside the browser. Changing the default program for pdfs has yielded no results, IE still uses Nuance inbrowser.p  pAnyone have any thoughts on how to change IE or Chrome to default to using Reader to show pdf files instead of Nuancep  pThanksp

Negative 847 pI have had a mobile app for some time now which uses a custom login flow that utilizes json web tokens Java based front end servers. I would now like to be able to allow users to login via Facebook for convenience reasons. Reading the flow of Facebook login the user enters their FB credentials, then Facebook returns back to the device if successful of course an access token alongside other information such as email, scope etc. When this information comes back to the device I would then send to my server the email address and check if it is a current user or not. If it is I would allow them to proceed , but if they are new they would then need to add some additional information. The problem I am seeing is cant the user just spoof the email address on the client side before sending it my server How do I know the email coming into my app is for the user validated for me.p  pI have read their documentation on integrating FB with existing login systems a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginmultipleproviders relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginmultipleprovidersa but cant seem to find  and androidiOS logins but cant find how this common scenario is prevented.p

Negative 847 pDo forgive me if this is not the correct Stack Exchange site for this question and tell me which is. p  pWe log machine breakdowns at a production plant. Of the data logged some is Machine Downtime, Location and Date. Machine Downtime being the duration of the breakdown, Location being which set of machines and well Date, the date of the breakdown.p  pThe graph Im trying to make will have a column graph and a line graph. There will be a column for each breakdown and the duration dictates the height yaxis. The line graph will start at zero and increase by one every day there isnt a breakdown. If there is a breakdown, the count will reset to zero.p  pThe current problems encountered are I cant get the dates on the xaxis to be spaced evenly apart by time, they are only spaced by each data point and some months have twice as many breakdowns leading to uneven spread. Another is how will I filter the Locations I know you can filter the way I want in PivotCharts but I dont think Ill be able to use a PivotChart for this. The last is the line graph itself, what function or formula would I write to achieve thisp

So, deppending on the user role or any other condition, some fields may have the disabled attribute equals to true or false, and here is where the problems appears.p  pIf the user edit the HTML and change the field that was previously disabled, he can now edit and change my model that he should not be able to change. Sometimes, such fields cannot be handledvalidated in the backend because the backend knows that it may be changed by a user that has permission to do it.p  pNote The user with roles to edit those fields is just an example, sometimes is just impossible to identify using validations in the backend when the field can or cannot be edited, in that case, we apply some view logic to decide when setting a field as disabled or enabled.p  pIwas wondering, is there any good approach to handle with this situation Does anyone faced the same problem How did you solved the problemp

Negative 847 pIm playing with the codeakkastreamandhttpexperimentalcode 1.0. So far, Ive a user service that can accept and respond to HTTP requests. Im also going to have an appointment service that can manage appointments. In order to make appointments, one must be an existing user. Appointment service will check with the user service if the user exists. Now this obviously can be done over HTTP but Id rather have the appointment service send a message to the user service. Being new to this, Im  not clear how to use actors as codeakkahttpcode abstracts that to send and receive messages. Theres mention of codeActorRefcode and codeActorPublishercode in the a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkastreamandhttpexperimental1.0scalastreamintegrations.html relnofollowdoca but no examples of the former and the later looks like an overkill for my need.

Negative 847 pI programmatically instantiate a UIViewController from a xib, add it as a child VC to an existing main view, then add the child VCs view which contains a button to my main view. The view with the button displays just fine, but when I press the button, the app crashes with an unrecognized selector message.  p  pI created the XIB by creating a custom subclass of a UIViewController  File  New  Cocoa Touch class, selecting a subclass of UIViewController, and asking Xcode to also generate the XIB file. I then placed a button on that XIB, and hooked it up to the newly created UIViewController subclass. The XIB files owner is set to the name of the new class.p  pSo it looks to me like the ButtonPushed action message doesnt get send to my custom UIVC, and is going instead to the generic UIViewController  which rightly doesnt understand the ButtonPushed message. p  pHow do I make sure that the action message sent when the button is pressed in fact goes to my custom UIViewController p  pThis is the code in my awakeFromNib method for the main view main view is from Main.storyboardp  precodeUIViewController vc2  [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibNameButtonVC bundlenil]  vc2.view.frame  CGRectMake90, 140, 50, 200 dont obscure the main view completely.  [self addChildViewControllervc2] [self.view addSubviewvc2.view]  vc2.view has a button, which shows up fine  [vc2 didMoveToParentViewControllerself] codepre  pIve managed to get the equivalent functionality by creating a storyboard just with the button, and programmatically loading that, then instantiating my buttonViewController, adding it and its view as a child VC to my main view. That works just fine, but it seems to me like I should be able to achieve this with only a XIB.p
Negative 847 pProblem p  pI am building a photo organizationbackup iOS app which requires users photos from their device galleries to be uploaded to our server.p  pUser creates his profile and logs into the app and his gallery is scanned for images.The uploads happen in batches of around 10 files as multipart form data requests. After each batch is uploaded, I need to make an api call to our server to commit the just concluded upload. The server could also be making its own commits like creating albums based on image content etc. after processing the batches previously committed. If that happens, the client gets an out of sync response from server while committing the upload and it has to first fetch the server commits before it commits the upload. Subsequently upload of the next batch of 10 images is scheduled.p  pI am using NSURLSessionUploadTask for this purpose. When the upload finishes while the app is in suspended state, the app gets woken up and I may be required to do either 1,2,3 or just 2,3 belowp  ol liFetch commits done by the server for previous committed uploadsli liCommit the upload that just finishedli liSchedule next batch of 10 images for uploadli ol  pp  pThis isnt working for us. The app wont have enough time for executing 1,2,3 or 2,3 when its woken up after the upload finishes. Requesting background execution time cant take is beyond 180 seconds because Apple caps it at that.p  pI cannot just keep uploading batches without committing them because the server has a buffer of 100 images before it starts overwriting images. If I continue uploading without committing, the server starts to overwrite previously uploaded images thus losing data.p  pAlso I have observed that even if I tried uploading multiple batches of images without performing any commits, the first task I schedule as NSURLSessionUploadTask in the background as soon as the ongoing upload finishes is not picked up by the uploader deamon nsurlsessiond immediately. Sometimes it picks it up after 5 minutes, sometimes after 10. Through out the process, I am having a good Wifi connection and my NSURLSession is configured accordingly.p  pFor the above I had read on StackOverflow that if the nsurlsessiond queue gets empty it doesnt pick the next task immediately. So just for experimenting I submitted 34 batches to upload and put the app into background but the behavior is the same. The second upload doesnt get picked up until 510 minutes and so on for 3rd and 4th.p  pp  pI have seen Google photos upload continuously without using location services. Dropbox also does it. Their commit architectures may be different from ours. But currently, I am not even able to get 34 batches of image to upload continuously  even after ignoring the whole commit side of things where I have to make extra api calls.p  pCan you guide us in analyzing this situation so that I can come up with a solution for background uploads for our app.p  pThanks again.p
