In IE10 it does not. In fact, it takes three clicks to get the contenteditable DIV to fire onclick once.p  pWhats going on herep  pSide note IE10 will fire an oncontrolselect event on the initial click of the contenteditable element. But the second click doesnt, even though it sets the selection. Which is dangerous because to the user, it appears they have set the cursor inside at that point.p

Negative 8404 pWe are working with some new Cutting Tools that can have its hardware parameters altered through the serial port instead of just a control panel. p  pWhen the hardware parameters are altered the hardware will take a few seconds to reconfigure itself and then signal that it is ready to be used.p  pOur setup before this involved the operator clicking on a Cut Plate or Part command. The software will display a dialog allowing the operator change anything that is motion related speed, delays, etc as well as display what configuration the hardware should be in. After the operator verifies everything he click OK and the machine starts cutting.p  pFor the new Hardware we pull out the current configuration if there is a change we transmit and throw up a dialog showing what the new configuration is along with a indicator showing whether the hardware is ready. Not everything is automated through the serial port so sometime the dialog has to stay up there until the operator clicks OK. Other times it can unload itself when the hardware signals it is right.p  pMy problem and question is that doing this through the serial ports is all painfully slow. It also the first time we done this type of work. I am concerned that I missing some solution to make the whole thing more responsive. It is not an option to use an alternative to serial as we buy the cutting hardware from a third party.p  pAnother thing I would like to do is have the option of displaying a status dialog and leave it running without the serial communication bogging down the rest of the system. p  pTips for the Win32 API, or .NET are what I am looking for. p

Negative 8404 pIve done a fair amount of work on MVC on the web, and were learning about it in my OOP class. Im seeing some differences, and I cant tell whether thats because the Webs version of the MVC pattern is different than the traditional one, or whether I misunderstood it.p  pFrom my understanding, The model your flat files, RDBMS, etc is a generic datahousing object. The View Browser, HTML, etc is what the user interacts with, and the controller mediates between the users actions and the data. The controller is the most domainspecific part, and it manages the views, tells the model what it needs, and tells the views what to display.p  pIn class, we have the Views matching what I just described, the Model contains a list of the views so that it can update them when the data changes, and the controller simply maps the users actions to calls to the model and to specific objects which may themselves, ask the model to update the views. What ends up happening is that most of the business logic is in the model, and its tied very heavily to the simulation or application that is being written, while the Controller is reduced to a mapping tool between commands and methods.p  pWhat are your thoughts on thisp

Negative 8404 pIve had a discussion with a colleague about Linq to SQL. I am still new at .NET so he thinks I need to learn more. still, 30 years of general programming experience should count in my advantage, right I had read some books and for a new project I decided to use the ADO.NET Entity Data Model. My colleague disagreed because he knew that entities had lots of problems. It caused memory leaks at the database server and Microsoft is going to discontinue it anyway. He told me I should use a Data Module instead. Just add a .dbml to my project and use Link on top of this.p  pHe has 5 years of .NET experience, which is 4 years more than my experience.p  pI stopped myself so I wouldnt call him a moron or idiot or whatever because it appears to me that he thinks that Link to SQL  Entity Data Model...p  pStill, I started to have some small doubts. I thought that Linq to SQL is based upon .dbml files, thus based upon data models. And Ive heard that Linq to SQL does have a few technical problems and that its soon to be replaced by the Entity model. If my colleague mixed these two up, then hes an utter moron. But since he has 5 years of experience and since I doubt that my employee would even hire morons, I started to have doubts.p  pSo, what is Linq to SQL exactlyp

Negative 8404 pIm using Visual Studio 2008 to build a Solution with two Projects a C Console App and a C DLL. I want the app to call a function from the dll using PInvoke. Therefore Im trying to add the dll as a Reference to the C app. But when I try the Add Reference command, Visual Studio wont let me do it unless I set the clr property on the dll under Configuration PropertiesGeneral. Now, I thought that PInvoke could handle plainold win32 dlls. Indeed, if I build my dll without clr and just copy it by hand to binDebug, then the app runs fine. So why is clr required to add the dll as a reference And if VS wont let me add it, is there some clean workaround so that my app finds the dllp  pI see that someone had a similar issue here though with a 3rdparty dll a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1377019unabletoaddadllreferencetovs2008httpstackoverflow.comquestions1377019unabletoaddadllreferencetovs2008a The answer he got was to build a wrapper.

In other words, compiler didnt build an array due to its developers giving it specific instruction such as emwhen you see words strongnewstrong and strongname of some typestrong and strongtwo pairs of square brackets [] []strong, then follow these stepbystep instructions , which will tell you in full details what to doem, but instead developers just build in some math related logic and from that compiler was capable deriving an array by itself, without developers giving it step by step instructions.   p  pBTW  I do understand about jagged and rectangular arrays and how they are initialized etc  p

Neither me or my workpartner has any problems when executing the same query on REMOTE2.p  pWhen testing locally it never hangs neither through C or HeidiSQL.p  pstrongAlso notestrong p  ul liwe upgraded the MySQLserver on REMOTE1 to 5.1.51 since the problem existed on the previous version tooli limy workpartner has two computers, one of which has HeidiSQL version 5.0.0.3272 and the other version 5.1.0.3316. On both of these computers he can manually execute the query and it works on REMOTE1, but not through Ccode.li liIn Ccode, we have tried with 3 different connectors, MySQL Connector 5.x.x, 6.1.5 and 6.3.5 nothing seems to work.li liI updated to HeidiSQL 5.1.0.3569 and the same error shows.li ul  pANY IDEAS p  pTHe table structure is listed below as.

Negative 8404 pIm trying to display html table of values with about 20 columns  where say staff users see one subset of columns, and nonstaff users see another subset of columns.  I may want to define further types of users later.  Now right now I have three static header rows so the template looks like p  precodelttablegt lttrgt   ltthgtCol Altthgt    if user.isstaff ltthgtCol Bltthgt endif    ...    if not user.isstaff ltthgtCol Kltthgt endif  lttrgt lttrgt   lttdgtCol A second headerlttdgt    if user.isstaff lttdgtCol B second headerlttdgt endif    ...    if not user.isstaff lttdgtCol K second headerlttdgt endif lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtCol A third headerlttdgt  ...  lttrgt   for obj in objectlist  lttrgt   lttdgt obj.cola lttdgt    if user.isstaff lttdgt obj.colb lttdgt endif    ...    if not user.isstaff lttdgt obj.colk lttdgt endif  lttrgt  endfor lttablegt codepre  pHowever, I find nonDRY as every time, if I want to change if a usertype can see a column, I have to change it in 4 places.  Or if I want to define multiple different classes of users, Id have to have complicated if statements.  Id prefer something likep  precode  if showcola lttdgtobj.cola lttdgt endif  codepre  pWhere I can define at the top of the template or possibly in the view that user.isstaff can see showcola.  Is something like this possible  Im using a generic view objectlist.  Maybe modify all users to have attributes user.showcola somehow and do  if user.showcola   Im not sure how to add boolean attributes to users.p  pEDIT May want multiple users with custom views e.g., staffview adminview, unprivileged, etc., so if statements would get unwieldy.  A cells contents is typically more complicated than  obj.colb  tried simplifying problem to get to the point.  E.g.p  precodelttdgt if obj.customaddress     obj.customaddress.webprintsafe   else     obj.business.address.webprintsafe   endif lttdgt codepre  pAlso while multiple templates would work with a simple switch like      if user.isstaff          include templatestaff.html       else  if user.isadmin          include templateadmin.html       else          include templateother.html       endif       endif p  pI find its not DRY at all e.g., every edit to a template has to be replicated in three  template.  I guess I could make a script that read generates the three templates from some supertemplate outside of django but its getting very inelegant.p

Negative 8404 pIm looking to see how I can use the IIS PowerShell Cmdlet strongNewWebAppPoolstrong to specify the version of the .NET Framework to use.  Currently, it defaults to v2.0, however I am using MVC, and this will not work because thats a v4.0 feature.  We really want each site to have its own Application Pool, and it seems we must create those pools manually due to the inability to configure them via script.  Is there any way to automate thisp  pIm afraid the answer is going to be you cant, because the a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryee790585.aspxdocumentationa doesnt appear to offer any parameters for setting it, and Google is turning up squat its giving me the impression that only setting up sites in a scripted manner is acceptable, and something about configuring Application Pools is just not done.

Negative 8404 pWhat optimizations exist for trying to find the longest path in a cyclic graphp  pLongest path in cyclic graphs is known to be NPcomplete. What optimizations or heuristics can make finding the longest path faster than DFSing the entire graph Are there any probabilistic approachesp  pI have a graph with specific qualities, but Im looking for an answer to this in the general case. Linking to papers would be fantastic. Here is a partial answerp  ol lipConfirm it is cyclic. Longest path in acyclic graphs is easily computed using dynamic programming.pli lipFind out if the graph is planar which algorithm is best. If it is, you might see if it is a block graph, ptolemaic graph, or cacti graph and apply the methods found in a hrefhttpwww.springerlink.comcontentx4fbqn45f6u1jeyhthis papera.pli lipFind out how many simple cycles there are using a hrefhttpdutta.csc.ncsu.educsc791spring07wrapcircuitsjohnson.pdfDonald B Johnsons algorithma a hrefhttpnormalisiert.decodejavaelementaryCycles.zipJava implementationa. You can change any cyclic graph into an acyclic one by removing an edge in a simple cycle. You can then run the dynamic programming solution found on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLongestpathproblemthe Wikipedia pagea. For completeness, you would have to do this N times for each cycle, where N is the length of the cycle. Thus, for an entire graph, the number of times you have to run the DP solution is equal to the product of the lengths of all cycles.pli lipIf you have to DFS the entire graph, you can prune some paths by computing the reachability of each node in advance. This reachability, which is mainly applicable to directed graphs, is the number of nodes each node can reach without repetitions. It is the maximum the longest path from that node could possibly be. With this information, if your current path plus the reachability of the child node is less than the longest youve already found, there is no point in taking that branch as it is impossible that you would find a longer path.pli ol

As you may expect, this simple query will just match those media nodes whose title element contains a substring of what the value of string title is. So if our title is Chi, it will return media nodes whose title may be Chicago or Chicken.p  pThe refinement request posted by the client is that there should be NO casesensitivity. The very intuitive way is to modify the XQuery statement by using a lowercase function in it, likep  precodequery  mediaNodesmedia[containslowercasetitletext,lowercasetitle], codepre  pHowever, the question comes this modified query will run my machine into memory overflow. Since my mediadata.xml is quite huge and contains thouands of millions of media nodes,  I assume the lowercase function will run on each of the entries, thus causing the machine to crash.   p  pIve talked with some experienced XQuery programmer, and they think I should use an index to solve this problem, and I will definitely research into that. But before that, I am just posting this problem here to get other ideas or any suggestions, do you think any other way may help for example, could I tweak the Java parse statement to realize the caseinsensitivity Since I think I saw some people did some string concatenation by using contains. in Java before passing it to the server.p  pAny idea or help is welcomed.p

Negative 8404 pI am working on a Java program that checks XML files for characters that have no glyph representation in a certain font with codeFont.canDisplaycodep  pThe XML files should be utf8 encoded by default. Entities in the XML code are parsed and transformed to a charint value before they get checked by codecanDisplaycode.p  pIn order to provide flexibility, the program accepts two parametersp  ul liThe file name of the XML fileli liA font nameli ul  pI would like to check whether the specified font exists on the system, because otherwise there is not much sense in using codecanDisplaycode.p  pAs far as I understand, Java 6 supports OTF fonts. However, when I use codegetAvailableFontFamilyNamescode from java.awt., it apparently only lists TTF fonts.p  pId like to know whether there is a way to check whether a OTF font given by its name exists. And in general, if using OTF fonts in Java on windows is practical. p  pThe purpose of this We use renderXs XEP to convert xslfo into PDFs. I would like to be able to detect whether the xslfo file contains characters that wont be displayable with a certain font. XEP doesnt give a warning and just prints empty spaces instead of the glyphs. What makes it worse is that it seems to confuse his computation of the spacing for justified text, so lines with those empty spaces are longer or shorter than the current justified block size.p  pI know that there are certain caveats, e.g. I would have to check whether a character is to be displayed regular, italic or bold, and then check for a glyph in that specific font face. But for now a more general approach that checks whether a glyph for a character exists at all in the regular font face would be enough.p

Negative 8404 pI have a SQL DTS package running on a SQL Server 2005 database that, for the most part, works properly.  However, sometimes it fails and I cant figure out why.p  pThe package consists of an SQL task which creates a bunch of temp tables, a bunch of data transformations, then another SQL task at the end to drop the temp tables created in the first step.p  pThe package fails every now and again because one of the temp tables referenced in a Transform Data Task cant be found, despite the table being one of the temp tables created in the first step.p  pThe only difference I can see between the intermittently failing task and all the other Transform Data Tasks is the Table Name property for the Destination  it is fully qualified, ie. MyDatabase.dbo.TempTable, whereas all of the other tasks just have the table name specified as TempTable.  I have no idea why this one is different, or how to fix it.  I am assuming that this is the problem as its the only thing that seems to be different between this one task and all of the others.p  pAlso, if I manually execute the first step of the DTS to create the temp tables before executing the package in full, it always works.p  pCan anyone shed any light on what the problem may be here or how I can unqualify the destination table namep  pThanksp

After the view is ready, all rotations are recognized and work perfect.p  pIs there a way to tell the app check your orientation now Several tricks I found didnt work anymore and the apple documentation seems less than helpful on this special topic.p  pSo far the newest suggestion I found was to create a dummy view, show it and release it again, but I tried several places in the app and it didnt work. The view always gets stuck until you rotate the iphone manually. I would prefer a working example, so I can test it directly and see if it works before changing my code, but Im also thankful for an explanation what to do if it works.p  pThanksp  pedit As mentioned in one of the links this is considered a bug and not fixed by Apple, I worked around the problem replacing the NavigationController with own Controllers each with a Scrollview. Not very nice when you have all running and just need the rotation to work as expected, but works at least as expected. Thx to occulus for pointing in the right direction.p

Negative 8404 pIve loaded a wavefront model file .OBJ and .MTL and stored the verticesindices in a VBO for rendering. Now I only populate the VBO once when the model is loaded. My question is... What is the best way to reuse this vertex data to redraw multiple instances of the model At the moment, Im just storing a transform matrix rotation, scaling and translation for each instance of the model and calling the codedrawcode function for each instance with the relevant transform matrix. p  pIs this a completely incorrect way to do this What are some betteralternative ways to achieve the same outcomep  pObviously, this will only work for very basic models where the object is stationary with respect to itself i.e. that no parts of the model are moving regardless of its world orientation. This is what leads me to believe that there are indeed much better ways to do this. p  pHope my ramblings make sense...p

Negative 8404 pHow would you implement this app in JavaScript using principles of MVCp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIWtAi.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, the app basically has 3 views Sidebar, Visualization amp Timeslider. The underlying model must keep track of selected countries and year. p  pWhen initing the app, it should load a json file that populates the model with data. With some sort of event system please advice, the controller should be notified of a stable model, and corresponding views should be set.p  pFor example, adding a country in the sidebar should trigger data reload, followed by updating of xy scales of the visualization view to accomodate for more countries etc.p  pHow would you separate the logic from the views what would go in the model, view amp controller respectively and what libraries would you use especially re. event handling.p  pCode is much appreciated ...

It displays a new image every 4 seconds. The images have text on them, or better insider jokes. Readers should be tempted to read them, but if the automated rotation cought there antention, the have to keep that antention for a full minute to see all images. Thats probably to long.

Thats the plan.p  pThank you Prusse, for now it bedtime, I will try to grasp your answer tomorrow  p

Negative 8404 pComing from RobotlegsPureMVC, I am pretty familiar with the concept of the view mediator, i.e. a component that pretty much listens to eventsrequests coming from the dummy view and makes a further request, sends an applicationwide signalevent, executes a command, etc,  based on the request from the view. p  pCan the host component idea introduced in Flex 4 be considered a the same as a mediator The only thing that slightly bothers me is that host components are still considered views, because they extend SkinnableComponent or any of the classes that further inherit from it. In my view, the mediator should be completely left out of view logic. p  pNevertheless, I do not want to write a skin, a host component, and a view mediator for that host component, because that would be quite an overhead, and would lead to more complexity rather than abstraction. p  pShould I use host components as mediators, and put applicationlevel logic there, for instance application level event dispatchingp

Negative 8404 pOne of our users has decided that they need to be able to edit sections of content on our main website and Ive been given the task of implementing it. The underlying model is that one or more divs in the page will have their content populated from a CMS. p  pTo deliver the content Im using an observer model to deliver content and this works fine. The page contains at least 3 server controls data provider CMS, controller subject and container observer. The container will contain one of two content panels edit or view which will render on the screen appropriately with data pushed from the controller. p  pHowever, now I need to be able to switch between the editor and viewer panels so changes can be previewed and to be able to publish the edited content to the data provider CMS but I keep losing the edited content on the postback. Ive attempted to override the SaveViewState method but because the content panel is created after during the prerender as it depends on a ViewState property, the control collection always shows the object that was created before i.e. when the edit panel is being shown, the object in the control collection is the preview panel. p  pI dont want to go down the road of having both controls rendering for performance issues Im considering creating a tertiary component probably a hidden field that will store the edited text but was hoping someone on here might have a better idea how to structure thisp

Negative 8404 pIm having a hard time coming up with informative and useful class names. One class I am have this problem with makes requests to websitesservers. I thought it would only be fitting to name this class codeServerRequestcode which is within the package of codeServerServicescode. This package also contains the classes codeServerDatacode and codeServerImagecode. codeServerDatacode parses the response from codeServerRequestcode and creates objects. codeServerImagecode will copy remote images to local machine using codeServerRequestcode.p  pI dont feel like its good practice to prefix every class name. At the same time I dont want to simply name the classes codeRequestcode, codeDatacode, and codeImagecode. Without the prefix the names lose their meaning, not to mention how common they become.p  pWhat are good conventions to use, beyond CamelCase and using nounsp  pWhat are some examples of class names to use for the three classes abovep

Negative 8404 pIm going through Programming In Scala 2nd Edition by Odersky, Spoon, and Venners, and this example threw me for a loop since it seemed to go against what I thought was true about functional programming and immutability. In the example and earlier in the book in Ch. 18, the authors claim that operations on an object can still be purely functional even when those operations might internally mutate the state of the object. The example, which is on p.442, Ch. 19, is thisp  precode class Queue[T] private     private[this] var leading List[T],     private[this] var trailing List[T]        private def mirror        if leading.isEmpty         while trailing.isEmpty           leading  trailing.head  leading          trailing  trailing.tail                   def head T         mirror      leading.head          def tail Queue[T]         mirror      new Queueleading.tail, trailing          def enqueue[U gt T]x U        new Queue[U]leading, x  trailing   codepre  pThe justification given is that, so long as it side effects are not visible to clients, something like this can be considered functional. I guess I can get behind that...I mean strictly speaking thats what defines a function. But admittedly and Im not really too savvy about what the JVM memory model guarantees, but arent there potential problems with that in this codep  pFor instance, if two threads are running operations on this queue, which looks like this to startp  precodeLeading Nil Trailing List1,2,3,4 codepre  pIsnt it possible that one thread could call head getting to this point in mirror before being descheduledp  precodeprivate def mirror        if leading.isEmpty         while trailing.isEmpty           leading  trailing.head  leading          gt trailing  trailing.tail               codepre  pAt which point the queue looks like thisp  precodeLeading List1 Trailing List1,2,3,4 codepre  pAnd when a second thread calls tail while the first is not active, this would be returnedp  precodeLeading Nil Trailing List1,2,3,4 codepre  pWhereas if the first threads head call were to finish, this would be returned after a subsequent tail call on that listp  precodeLeading List2,3,4 Trailing Nil codepre  pIm admittedly not great at this kind of stuff and concurrent programming is really mindbending for me, as Im sure it is for a lot of people, Im just curious what Im missing here.p

Negative 8404 pOne of the basics of this new website I am making it that it allows for a user to select their favourite game.

But heres where my data structure issue comes inp  pAs each user will only have one favourite game, should I just have one table for the users where the Favourite Game field is included OR, should I have a Users table, and a Games table with a link table inbetween which stores the ID of the User and the ID of the gamep  pIf I were to have other options such as favourite genre too, would this be an efficient way of doing it I just feel that at the end Ill end up with a huge flat file database, but this seems to be the best way and itd be easier to create forms for it.p  pThoughtsp

Negative 8404 pI am currently running a project where we need to annually store 40 billion documents PDF,TIFF for roughly 200 million accounts and was wondering if it is possible to use Cassandra for that this is mainly because of the scalability, stability and multiple datacenter use in the Cassandra design.p  pBut I wonder if it is a good idea to use Cassandra for this at all  or would another alternative like CouchDB be a better optionp  pJust a note, we dont need full text search in the documents and for each document there will only be a limited of metadata attached to each  like date, time, origin, owner and unique id, plus a few keywords. Access to documents will normally be done through a query on owner id and from there choose the document needed through origin and optionally datetime. So nothing fancy. p  pThanks for your thoughts on this. p

Negative 8404 pI am working on a website that displays some data from DB that changes frequently Status of a queue and a chat conversation.  My current setup is ApachePHPMySQL.  Naturally I would like to avoid polling the server every x seconds since this does not scale well.  I would like to do reverse ajax long polling, however, Ive read that Apache does not work well with this since it quickly runs out of worker threads.  There are many other web servers out there that get around this problem nginx, tornado, etc.  However, my problem is, PHP is the ONLY serverside scripting language I know.  Also Ive already written some PHP scripts so Id like to keep them if I can.  I am ok with switching server so long as I can still use PHP.p  pBut after doing some more research, Ive read that people say PHP PHPFPM also creates a process for every request made, which means if I have hundredsthousands of open connections, there will be hundredsthousands of processes, which will be problem as well.p  pCan I conclude that theres no good scalable ways to make long polling websites using PHP  Should I abandon PHP and learn another server scripting language  I can continue developing long polling using my current setup ApachePHP for now but I dont want the choice of scripting language to pose any limitation on the scalability of my system when I deploy.  So what should I do  I am not very experienced with web programming, so if any gurus out there can give me some pointers Id appreciate it  Thank youp

I put it and now I can see that mouse events are captured but my rollovereffect is not displayed anymore even if i delete the transition of states and I play with the visible  truefalse of the effect in my mouse over handler.p  pstrongLAST EDITstrong I finally found the solution of my problem, thanks to all.

Negative 8404 pI am working with a consultant who recommends creating a measure dimension and then adding the measure dimension key to our fact table.  p  pI can see how this can make adding new measures easier by just adding rows instead of physically creating columns in the fact table.

We currently have close to twenty measures.p

Negative 8404 pI use the PhotoScroller apples sample code. Ive modified it to have a universal application for displaying image books with paging and zooming scrollview. This works and the behaviour is what I expect.p  pNow I would like to add a functionality. Here is the description of this function p  pWhen the user double tap on a specific part of a page Id like that a kind of popover appears on screen containing a zoom focus. Here is a simulation p  pa hrefhttpwww.charmissimo.comtempsimulation.JPG relnofollowhttpwww.charmissimo.comtempsimulation.JPGap  pThe focus is a zoom of 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending of where the user doubletapped note that 1, 2, 3 and 4 are part of the same jpg image. The user can then swipe left or right to change the focus from 1 to 2 and so on... The focus disappears when the user doubletaps outside of the focus.p  p3 other things to mention    The app must be universal so I cant use popover which is supported only on ipad   The app must be compatible with IOS 4 and IOS 5   The position and size of 1, 2, 3 and 4 can change depending of the initial imagep  pQuestion is  How can I achieve this What modifications of PhotoScroller sample do I need to dop  pI hope all is clear  Feel free to ask for more information if necessary...p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8404 pI have an OS X app which uses the codeNSSpeechSynthesizercode class to read some text. I need to be able to set the speed of the reading, which is done using the coderatecode property of codeNSSpeechSynthesizercode. However, different voices have different baseline reading rates and different ranges as well. The problem is that I cannot find a way to get this range from the voice so that I know what values are acceptable for the voice. This is important since I want to be able to abstract from the difference in ranges and just let the user choose something like slownormalfast. But for a voice with a baseline of 180 words for a minute a value of 100 would be considered slow, which clearly is not the case for a voice with a baseline of 100 words per minute.p  pIs there a way of getting those ranges I didnt find anything useful in the class reference for codeNSSpeechSynthesizercode.p

Negative 8404 pCurrently converting an old asp.net web forms page into a asp.net mvc version, and a little stuck on something that isnt a major deal, but would be a nice to have.p  pWhen the user logs in, they are taken to a messages page at Alerts.  They can close individual messages by clicking the xs, and then if they close all the message they are moved onto another page automatically.p  pThe original site did postbacks, so the URL stayed the same.  In my new version, I planned to make the x button a link, that went to AlertsConfirmxx where xx is the id.  The problem is, after processing, the address bar stays on that url, whereas Id like to leave it on Alertsp  pThe four solutions appear to be eitherp  p1 using AJAX to do the processingp  p2 a redirect back to Alerts after processingp  p3 replacing all the X links with a submit button, and using javascript to pass a different ID depending on which message is being acknowledged, so that I can change the Confirm method to an HttpPostaccepting Index method   p  p4 URL Rewrites not sure about this, just thought of as I wrote thisp  pOr am I missing something obvious that would do what Im trying to achievep

Negative 8404 pI am looking at alternatives to a deep search algorithm that Ive been working on. My code is a bit too long to post here, but Ive written a simplified version that captures the important aspects. First, Ive created an object that Ill call BranchNode that holds a few values as well as an array of other BranchNode objects.p  precodeclass BranchNode  IComparableltBranchNodegt      public BranchNodeint depth, int parentValue, Random rnd              nodeDelta  rnd.Next100, 100         depth  depth  1         leafValue  parentValue  nodeDelta          if depth lt 10                      int children  rnd.Next1, 10             branchNodes  new BranchNode[children]             for int i  0 i lt children i                              branchNodes[i]  new BranchNodedepth, leafValue, rnd                                 public int CompareToBranchNode other              return other.leafValue.CompareTothis.leafValue            private int nodeDelta     public BranchNode[] branchNodes     private int depth     public int leafValue    codepre  pIn my actual program, Im getting my data from elsewhere... but for this example, Im just passing an instance of a Random object down the line that Im using to generate values for each BranchNode... Im also manually creating a depth of 10, whereas my actual data will have any number of generations.p  pAs a quick explanation of my goals, nodeDelta contains a value that is assigned to each BranchNode. Each instance also maintains a leafValue that is equal to current BranchNodes nodeDelta summed with the nodeDeltas of all of its ancestors. I am trying to find the largest leafValue of a BranchNode with no children.p  pCurrently, I am recursively transversing the heirarchy searching for BranchNodes whose child BranchNodes array is null a.k.a a childless BranchNode, then comparing its leafValue to that of the current highest leafValue. If its larger, it becomes the benchmark and the search continues until its looked at all BranchNodes.p  pI can post my recursive search algorithm if itd help, but its pretty standard, and is working fine. My issue is, as expected, that for larger heirarchies, my algorithm takes a long while to transverse the entier structure.p  pI was wondering if I had any other options that I could look into that may yield faster results... specificaly, Ive been trying to wrap my head around linq, but Im not even sure that it is built to do what Im looking for, or if itd be any faster. Are there other things that I should be looking into as wellp

Negative 8404 pI have an app that mimics the photos app in that it displays a table of thumbnails which represent an album that the user has clicked on.

For your reference the window Im talking about is belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhxzUZ.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfZRNa.png altenter image description herep  pIm able to get the end result to turn out fine ie after the animation is complete, everything works, however my rotation doesnt look as good as the photos app. The photos app actually looks like its rotating the window and you can barely notice the photos resetting themselves. On mine, you can see the thumbnails sort of moving around  and it doesnt look as good. p  pDoes anyone have a clue as to what the photos app is doing Is it possible that its speeding up the animation, or maybe blurring it in the middle so you cant see whats going on My code is listed belowp  precode UITableViewCell  tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       static NSString CellIdentifier  Cell      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]      if cell  nil              cell  [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier] autorelease]          else              for UIButton photoButton in [cell subviews]                      [photoButton removeFromSuperview]                    NSInteger photosPerRow      if self.interfaceOrientation  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait              photosPerRow  4          else              photosPerRow  6           CGRect frame  CGRectMake4, 2, 75, 75      for int i  [indexPath row]  photosPerRow i lt [indexPath row]  photosPerRow  photosPerRow ampamp i lt [[self photos] count] i              [[photos objectAtIndexi] setFrameframe]         [cell addSubview [photos objectAtIndexi]]         frame.origin.x  frame.origin.x  frame.size.width  4           return cell  codepre  pThen here is how Im animating it in my tableview controllerp  precode BOOL shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation      [self.tableView reloadData]     return toInterfaceOrientation  UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown  codepre  pUPDATE Well, Ive tried a lot. So far switched all my code to a scroll view, then tried to have the thumbnails animated as follows when a rotation occurs fade out the thumbnail, move it to its new location, then fade it in. Of course I only did that with UIThumbViews that needed to be moved. I coming to the conclusion that apple must be using two views in order to pull them off. One view with the old set of thumbnail views, then rotating over the new set of thumbnail views. Any ideasp

Negative 8404 pI am having an issue casting an entity to a interface to use within a static method.  The error I get is a strongInvalidCastExceptionstrong.  I need to perform this cast because I have a static method that needs to take an specific interface definition. I think though I havent tried that using an abstract class as opposed to an interface might work, but C doesnt support inheritance from abstract classes and my entity already inherits from one abstract class. p  pMy model is fairly simple.  I have one entity object  MemberStatus  that has an Id, Name and DisplayOrder.  It inherits from an Entity abstract class which inherits from IIdentifiableEntity and implements the INamedEntity, IOrderedEntity interfaces.  Each of these abstract classes or interfaces contains just one property Id, Name and DisplayOrder.p  pHeres my code within my domain projectp  precodepublic abstract class Entity  IIdentifiableEntity    public int Id  get set    public interface INamedEntity    string Name  get set     public interface IOrderedEntity    float DisplayOrder  get set    public class MemberStatus  Entity, INamedEntity, IOrderedEntity    public string Name  get set    public float DisplayOrder  get set    public interface IRepositoryltTEntitygt    TEntity FindByIdint id   bool InsertOrUpdateTEntity entity   ...

All this code was working perfectly until I made the MoveDisplayOrder static and changed the first parameter from strongcodeIRepositoryltMemberStatusgtcodestrong to strongcodeIRepositoryltIOrderedEntitygtcodestrong.

Negative 8404 pI had this idea and my first reaction after having it was Thats a great idea, but why have I never seenheard it talked about before  So Im hoping you can tell me if there is some framework out there that already does this, or if there is some reason why I should avoid it.p  pThe idea is to create a base business object class with methods to dynamically write CRUD sql queries based on the name of the derived class and its properties or aliases specified in  attributes.p  pMy thinking is that once I do this I could just create a new class like sop  precodeclass Customer BusinessObjectBase      int Id getset     string Name getset     string Phone getset  codepre  pand my Customer class, having access to BusinessObjectBases CRUD methods, would be done.p  pSomethings to keep in mind when answering this  For the sake of this question Im highly interested in the design goals of decreased development time and low maintenance, and security is about a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10.  In other words, Im not interested in hearing answers telling me I should be using stored procedures to access data because they are more secure, or anything along those lines.p  pI know the users here are pretty liberal with the close votes when it comes to overly broad questions... so just to be safe let me reiterate the question, which is not too broadp  pAre there any existing frameworks to do this or is there any compelling reason why I should notp

Negative 8404 pIm want to make code that reads assembly instructions x86 only and recreates them in other place of memory in order to make hook code. Like, I want to hook function X so I need to patch its at least first bytes with a jump and every instruction that I replace what can vary according the assembly code partially or not I need to recreate in a memory block of mine and then add an instruction to jump back to the original function X from the offset of the next instruction that I didnt touch. You probably know what Im saying since it isnt new for many. I dont want to make a complete perfect program but I want to make a fully extensible code base that would use a tree like I will explain below. To begin lets imagine some instructionsp  ul liA  0x12 0x13 .  .  this instruction has 4 bytes and the first two are static.li liB  0x12 .  this instruction has 2 bytes and the first one is static.li ul  pFor this case I would have a tree that would look likep  precode    Tree                 0x12         B   0x13                  A codepre  pSo when the code were to parse an instruction it would try to reach the instruction with the longest prefix and if it failed could stop and fail or try one above in the tree.p  pThe reasoning to wanting to make something like this is that I can extend later with instructions provided by dlls that is a must for what Im doing because I want to ship the code sooner that will handle like 90 of instructions and only take care of those more advanced in case I need in the future. p  pSo, now my question is what is the exact full information that a dll that would handle a code instruction would need  Like p  ul lithe address where the instruction starts. a must of courseli li the base address of the module that contains the address where the instruction starts I suppose this one is need in case that the instruction references some portion of the memory of its moduleli li a previous instruction. Dont know if there are instructions that need to know what the instruction before it did or something like thatli ul  pI also want to ask if the tree structure is ok or if there is some problem I will have.p  pSo, basically I want to ask you for help deciding what is the information I need to create the most generic possible code thatp  pgiven an address, parses its assembly instructions and according to the instruction will call function pointers in dlls that will copy those instructions.p  pSo, having something likep  precodevoid copyinstructionsvoid address,intamp len      int bytescopied  0     void instructions  block of bytes  dont care about the implementation      do               void copyinstructionvoid,int  getahandlertoinstructionataddress  this function will use the tree structure and retrieve a function from a dll          ifcopyinstruction  NULL              int len  0             void instruction  copyinstructionvoid address,amplen,...  I want to know how to make this function complete in terms of what it need for every case              ifinstruction                 fail              instructions  instruction  dont care about the implementation              address  len             bytescopied  len         else                 fail          whilebytescopied lt 5      addinstructionsjumptoinstructions,address  bytescopied      len  bytescopied      return   codepre  pMy questions would bep  pHow would a complete copyinstruction function header look like Is the tree mentioned above ok to implement getahandlertoinstructionat or I need something else.p

Negative 8404 pI am trying to design a database for codeRBACcode with a twist or perhaps its only me who thinks its a twist. As I understand codeRBACcode uses roles and permissions to grantdeny access to certain objects in my system. Everything is nice and clear when I have just one instance of my site and simply create a role codeMain admincode, codeSecondary admincode, codeUsercode etc. p  pHowever what if I have accounts inside the system So I have one system which has say codeLondoncode, codeTokyocode and codeMoscowcode accounts. Now I will have Main admin for each of the accounts, as well as many Users in each account  of course Moscow guys should not be able to login to London account. How do I do it Do I create some additional table that will bind assignments to accounts to users Or do I add accountid to assignments table Or perhaps i should create multiple roles like moscowmainadmin, londonmainadmin etc. What is the best approach for this type of situationp  pAlso I believe I will have some users who are Main admin for London account and Secondary admin for Tokyo account. p  pI plan to use Yii with its built in RBAC... if that makes any difference.p  pHow to tackle itp  pThank you in advancep

With the KeyListener, this worked fluently, even when keeping the button pressed.p  pLater, I added a JMenuBar to the GUI. Adding something to the ArrayList now has an own JMenuItem with its accelerator set to the KeyStroke 1 and an ActionListener which performs the same stuff than the KeyListener before.

Negative 8404 pIm using a thread pool that should be able to execute hundreds of concurrent tasks. However the tasks usually do very little computation and spend most of their time waiting on some server response. So if the thread pool size contains hundreds of threads just a few of them will be active while most of them will be waiting.p  pI know in general this is not a good practice for thread pools usage but the current design does not permit making my tasks asynchronous so that they can return the control without waiting for the servers response. So given this limitation I guess my biggest problem is increased memory consumption for the threads stack space.p  pSo is there any way to use some kind of lightweight threads that does not consume much memory p  pI now theres a JVM option Xss to control the stacks memory but its seems theres no way to control this per thread pool or thread only as opposed to changing it for all the threads inside the VM, rightp  pAlso do you have any suggestions for a better solution to my problemp

Negative 8404 pI am trying to organize my VS 2010 solution. One area that is holding me back is the use of Unmanaged DLLs. I cant add them as References because the DLLs are unmanaged. The previous approach was to xcopy the DLLs from a lib folder during the PrePost build events to the output folder. The downside of this was the unnecessary copying that occurs for every build and also the clean operation never removed the DLLs from the output folder.p  pMy ideal solution would be to consolidate the DLLs in a VS lib folder and make use of the Copy If Newer feature. However, VS creates a lib folder in the output folder and places the DLLs there. Please note that I do not prefer to have the DLLs on the top level of my Project tree.  There are a lot of DLLs and this seems to pollute the Project.p

Negative 8404 pWhile writing my first Blackberry application using Java, I am confused between inheriting from codeMainScreencode and codeScreencode classes.p  pMy initial understanding was that there should be just a single codeMainScreencodederived class in an application, since we would like to define the screen title and other embellishments only once. All the rest of the screens which are invoked on top of the codeMainScreencode should derive from codeScreencode.p  pHowever, this doesnt seem to be true as I have not been able to get a screen completely cover the nontitle area of the previous codeMainScreencode. p  pIs there anything specific which I have overlooked in understanding how multiple screens in a Blackberry application should be createdp

It is really annoying as the export works fine in all other browsers... Chrome and FF always download the latest version of the file from the server, IE updates the file randomly, sometimes only after I submit the page with different filters a few times...p  pI didnt include too many lines of my code as I rather think I am simply missing some kind of meta tag or something from my code, rather than have a logical bug in the lines I have already written.p  pI am really confused by this and annoyed to say the least...

I also used dbmsstats with 100 estimate percentagecompute mode to gather statistics so that oracle 11g CBO makes a more informed decision for the query plan, but it doesnt improve the query execution time.p  precode SQLgt desc tab3  Name                 Null    Type    COL1                          NUMBER38  COL2                          VARCHAR2100  COL3                          VARCHAR236  COL4                          VARCHAR236  COL5                          VARCHAR24000  COL6                          VARCHAR24000  MEASURE0                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE1                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE2                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE3                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE4                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE5                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE6                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE7                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE8                     VARCHAR24000  MEASURE9                     VARCHAR24000 codepre  pThe column codemeasure0code has 0.4 million unique values.p  precodeSQLgt select count from select measure0 from tab3 group by measure0 having count  1 abc    COUNT      403664 codepre  pThe following is the query with the execution plan, please note there are no indexes on the table.p  precodeSQLgt set autotrace traceonly  SQLgt SELECT  FROM    2     SELECT   3             ROWNUM 1 AS COL1,   4             ft.COL1         AS OLDCOL1,   5             ft.COL2,   6             ft.COL3,   7             ft.COL4,   8             ft.COL5,   9             ft.COL6,  10             ft.MEASURE0,  11             ft.MEASURE1,  12             ft.MEASURE2,  13             ft.MEASURE3,  14             ft.MEASURE4,  15             ft.MEASURE5,  16             ft.MEASURE6,  17             ft.MEASURE7,  18             ft.MEASURE8,  19             ft.MEASURE9  20     FROM tab3 ft  21     WHERE MEASURE0 IN  22        23             SELECT MEASURE0  24             FROM tab3  25             GROUP BY MEASURE0  26             HAVING COUNT  1  27        28   ABC WHERE COL1 gt 0 AND COL1 lt449  450 rows selected.

Why does the indexed version of the table takes more time to fetch the results than the non indexed version If I am not wrong it is the TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID that is taking up time.

Negative 8404 pI have an app that uses a service in the background to do some uploaddownload operations.

Negative 8404 pWe use Google Cloud Messaging to receive message on Android devices. Is it possible to display GCM message on device if device is in sleep mode with security enabled.

Negative 8404 pI have a tabpanel. In the tab, i have a panel which includes a toolbar and 3 items [ fieldset, a gridpanel, and another fieldset or some buttons]. I cannot get the gridpanel to show scroll bar.  It only works if i set the maxheightminheight of the gridpanel.br I also tried wrapping gridpanel inside a container.  No luck. In the example, i use fit layout.   I tried anchor layout, and assigned anchor100 50 to gridpanel, hoping that it would resize when i resize browser.  No luck.p  pAlternatively, if gridpanel is the ONLY item in the tab, autoscroll would work.

Negative 8404 pI have a C .NET 4 Windows Service that needs to store its run history records with datetime, stats, and successfailure. There will usually be 1 entry per day, so over time the run history will grow to a few hundred or low thousands, but I dont expect to grow into tens of thousands. Each entry will have 1015 fields.p  pThis run history needs to be read and displayed by a WPF application running on the same machine as the Windows Service. This machine has a fresh OS install with .NET Framework 4 and nothing else installed.p  pWhere is the best place and the best format to store the run history so that it can quickly and easily be loaded into the WPF appp  pI am considering an XML file, perhaps bound to a Grid Im not really a WPF expert. Would 1 XML file be OK for records of this size, and would it be easy to load in WPF Would you have any better recommendationsp

Negative 8404 pI am trying to use a static library in a project. The static library depends on several frameworks...

When I enable this, I get 120 errors all relating to my main project not being linked with the same frameworks as my static library CoreData, CFNetwork, AddressBook, etc.p  pIt is very inconvenient for a developer to want to use a static library, link to it, but then still be required to link to all of the frameworks that the library links to.  Is there any way to automate this process, so that the main project automatically links to all of the frameworks linked to by the static libraryp  pI am using XCode 4.4.p  pedit to be more clear, I have the followingp  precodeStaticLibrary.xcodeproj      AFNetworking          files...

This includes CoreData.framework, AddressBook.framework, etc.p  pNow what I would like to do is add this library to another project of mine. In fact, I would like to add this library to every new project I make from here on out, so I always have easy access to the convenience functionscategories that Ive written. So I add the library to my project, and then add the code.acode file to Build Phases  Link Binary With Libraries of my main project. I also do everything else necessary that I know of see comments.p  pWhat I would like to happen the main project is now linked to the library, so it inherits all of the librarys links so that the main project is now also linked to CoreData.framework, AddressBook.framework, etc.p  pWhat does happen the main project gives me errors because it is not linked to anything that the library requires.p  pIs there a way to automatically add the linked frameworks from the static library to the main project, or should I split the library up into CoreDataStaticLibrary, etc, and then require the developer to add CoreData.framework as well as the static library to the project target everytimep

Negative 8404 pIm not sure if this is a problem with Mongoid or with the standard Rails validators, but documents that are invalid are still being saved to the database.p  pI have models set up to something likep  precodeclass League   include MongoidDocument    hasmany teams    validate do     if teams.size gt 12       errors.addteams, too many teams     end   end end  class Team   include MongoidDocument    belongsto league end codepre  pI would expect the following test to pass, but it does not. Instead of my custom validation preventing more than 12 Teams from being added to a League, the league gets saved with 13 teams anyway.p  precode Factory for a League. FactoryGirl.define do   factory league do   name Test League    factory leaguewithteams do     ignore do       teamscount 5     end      aftercreate do league, evaluator       FactoryGirl.createlistteam,                                evaluator.teamscount,                                league league     end   end end  describe League do   it should not allow more than 12 teams do     league  FactoryGirl.createleaguewithteams, teamscount 12     league.teams ltlt FactoryGirl.createteam     league.shouldnot bevalid  passes     League.findleague.id.teams.size.should eq12  fails   end end codepre  pThe funny thing is, if I change the line in the test which adds the 13th team to use build instead of create, codeleague.teams ltlt FactoryGirl.buildteamcode, then the test passes. However this is not a solution because I want to guarantee that a League cannot have more than 12 teams regardless of whether or not the teams being added are new or already in the DB.p  pIs there anyway to guarantee thisp  pstrongEditstrongp  pAdding a validator to the Team model, like I did below, doesnt seem to work either.p  precodeclass Team   include MongoidDocument    belongsto league    validate do team     if league.teams.size gt 12       errors.add base, cannot have more than 12 teams in a league     end   end end codepre  pI believe the problem has to do with the fact that codeltltcode and codepushcode are atomic operations, and therefore they skip callbacks and validations. That being said, this must be a fairly common usecase, no So how are other people validating the number of documents being referencedp

Negative 8404 pI understand that the call to CLGeocoder geocodeAddressString is asynchronous, with a block passed in to handle the callback at completion time.  I also understand that the only variables that are mutable within the block are local block variables.  But I need to store the resulting CLPlacemarks in a global NSMutableArray variable, and I cant work out how that can happen.  Any block variables can only be accessed within the same method, but at the point that they have any value i.e. within the block I cant assign any value to the global array.  After the block, the block variables will likely not have any value because of the immediate return when calling the async geocodeAddressString.p  pHow can I store the results of the call, so that they can be used to update a UITableViewp

Negative 8404 pI have a view with a lot of labels and buttons which are created on code because in IB is too complicated. This works ok.p  pIn IB I also created an input view which I want to appear from the bottom by the tap on a button. Very much like a keyboard if you will. Because this input view is strigth forward, it has been created on IB and it contains sliders, labels, etc. I havent added it as a subview of self.view on IB.p  pBy the tap of the button, I set up all the constrains for the input view I set the width, I set it on the bottom of the self.view with vertical size, then I remove this constraint, I add the actual heigth and then I animate with [self.view layoutIfNeeded].p  pThe thing is that the input view itsef animates correctly, but its subviews not so much. They kind of appear at once.p  pI have tried adding a input view programmatically, with only one switch. It animates quite nicely. p  pIm guessing that there is a problem with the constrains between the controls and their superView. But Im not sure about it, because although they do not animate correctly, they are on the correct place and witht the correct proportions. I guess Im missing something here. Maybe its not a good idea to mix IB set controls and views and programmatically modifying themp  pDoes somebody have any experience with thatp  pThanks in advance,p

They print separately with each line  wish they didnt. p  pI have tried suppressing duplicates, but it still adds the weights for each item. and if line2del1 and line3del1 are the same model but listed separately, it wont list the 2nd product.br if previous ordlindel  ordlindel then  , else ordlindel kind of works but the ship quantity wants a number and I dont want to show 0.  also would need to add if previous for all the fields except serial number......

Negative 8404 pI have the option to create an email wherein the contents can either be part of an HTML document or be an entire HTML document.

I have pretty much all of it set up and working except for the fact that the email parts in the sent email are way out of order and duplicated in some cases. It screws up the rendering of the email.

Negative 8404 pI have a LightSwitch project in VS 2012 that has an RIA Data Source reference to the assembly codePbs.OpportunityTracker.Riacode.  One of the entities in that assemblys domain service has a property of an enum type, codeAppointmentStatuscode, that is defined in another assembly, named codePbs.Crmcode.  codePbs.OpportunityTracker.Riacode references that assembly and builds fine.  However, when I go to the LightSwitch project to update the data source, the dialog presents an error codeCould not load type Pbs.Crm.Repository.AppointmentStatus from assembly Pbs.Crm, ...code.p  pIt seems the LightSwitch designer is only able to deal with types defined directly in the RIA assembly.  Moving the enum type is not an option, and defining a second enum type would require some rather tricky modifications to the custom QueryProvider, though it would be doable.  Still, its not ideal.  Anyone know of the reason behind this limitation and if theres a way to work around itp

Negative 8404 pI create a new Shape, make a listener that starts a function when an object hits the shape, the function clears graphics of the shape, removes listener and deletes the child. But it looks like it leaves some ghost that still triggers when my object comes to its place. Im not sure why it happens, I thought clearremove should make it impossible to hitTest. But somehow children still pile over one another and the last created one triggers the function. So if you understand, please give me a hint, if not please tell me in general strongwhat is a way to delete a created Shape for good, so it didnt count existingstrongp  pA bit of details. Hitting the shape must start a function that deletes it and creates a new shape of the same name that has a different function that does the same etc. so the current function must be the one I called for, not the last one, whose listener I deleted. Making new shape each time may overload memory, besides I do clean up every time. Did I forget anythingp  precodefun0   var bobShape  new Shape   addChildbob   bob...drawRect...   addEventListener...,fun1   function fun1 ifhitTest...   bob...clear   removeChildbob   removeEventListener...,fun1   fun2         fun2   var bobShape  new Shape   addChildbob   bob...drawRect...   addEventListener...,fun3   function fun1 ifhitTest...   bob...clear   removeChildbob   removeEventListener...,fun3   fun0      codepre  petc., it only sees fun3 after I once trigger it even though I deleted the listener. Again, I do move object away, it doesnt hitTest anymore, then clearremove.

Negative 8404 pIm in the process of trying to convert my code to work with fragments.  Im pretty new to Android, and I initially started out by making a lot of classes and just changing from one Activity to another Activity using intents.  I am taking one of my classes that reads a JSON Array from a server and presents the table as a list and trying to convert it to a fragment.  To do so, Ive followed the tutorial that is presented herep  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTGXenxtDEGQ relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTGXenxtDEGQap  pwhich says I should change my onCreate to an onStart and include an onCreateView, which I have done.  I also changed ClassName.this to getActivity where it appeared.  The code worked fine before trying to convert it to a fragment, but I am having issues now that I am trying to use fragments.  I think it has to do with the AsyncTask.  p  pIn the code block below, jParser is an instance of the JSONParser class I created, which handles parsing JSON data.  I have also checked to ensure that the URL I pass to the method is returning valid JSON to parse.

Negative 8404 pI recently uncovered a memory leak in an application I maintain for work, and Im confused as to why the code produces a leak. Ive pulled out the relevant code with slight modifications and provided it below.p  pIn our application, a given XML document could validate against one or more available schema files. Each schema file corresponds to a different version of the XML document as it has changed over time. We only care that the XML document validates against at least one schema. Each schema completely describes the contents of the XML document they are not nested schema files.p  pAccording to the ANTS memory profiler, it looks like the XmlDocument object is hording references to the previous schemas, even after the schema set has been cleared. strongCommenting out the call to Validate, leaving everything else the same, will stop the leak.strongp  pI fixed the leak in our application by loading the schemas strongoncestrong at application initialization time, and swapping out which schema file is associated with the XML document until we find one that validates.p  pThe code below produces the memory leak, and Im not sure why.p  precodeclass Program      private static XmlDocument xmlDocument  new XmlDocument      static void Mainstring[] args              using StreamReader reader  new StreamReadercontents.xml                      xmlDocument.LoadXmlreader.ReadToEnd                   XmlReaderSettings xmlReaderSettings  new XmlReaderSettings         xmlReaderSettings.CloseInput  true          while true                      xmlDocument.Schemas  new XmlSchemaSet              XmlReader xmlReader  XmlReader.Createschema.xsd, xmlReaderSettings              xmlDocument.Schemas.AddXmlSchema.ReadxmlReader, null              xmlReader.Close              xmlDocument.Validatenull                codepre

Negative 8404 pWhen using setContentOffset, whats the range of contentOffset   p  pNormally it seems that theres no constraint, but I also found that when the scrollView is in a viewController which is embed in navigationController and strongthe navigationBar is shownstrong, the contentOffset must be smaller than contentSize.eh,I actually means codecontentOffset.x lt contentSize.width  scrollView.bounds.size.widthcode and codecontentOffset.height lt contentSize.height  scrollView.bounds.size.heightcode. If the contentOffset.x or contentOffset.y is out of that range, then that value is the max value, i.e codecontentSize.width  scrollView.bounds.size.widthcode.p  pBut when strongsetting the navigationBar hiddenstrong, the contentOffset has no constraint, I can set any value and the offset works as wanted.p  pSo did I miss something why the hidden of navigationBar has effects on scrollViews contentOffsetp  pI also create a project to illustrate this problem on a hrefhttpsgithub.comcomcuterScrollViewContentOffset relnofollowgithuba.p

Negative 8404 pI am trying to implement two different Google CSE search boxes on the same page. The issue is that only the first instance works properly.

Negative 8404 pI can add in external OSGi bundles into my PDE project and I can get them to show up in the Target Platform although I need to perform a reload once I have added a new one, I do this with a lib directory in each project.p  pAs my project has become more sophisticated I require some Spring bundles, and I looked to Ivy the Ivy DE plugin to manage the dependencies for me. This did a great job of finding all the bundles that were needed which get added to the classpath.p  pThe problem is that I also need to add them to the target platform and I cannot find a way to get the target platform to look at the Ivy dependencies.p  pA possible workaround is to copy the Ivy dependencies into my lib directory. Im very new to Ivy and cannot see a way to get it to copy dependencies to a local directory to do that would seem to defy the point of Ivy. I also looked at adding the Ivy cache to the target platform a crazy idea but Eclipse couldnt find all the bundles because of the caches directory structure.p

Negative 8404 pI am working on a MATLAB Engine application.  In order for it to work, MATLAB needs to be added to the PATH environment variable so that the Engine application can find certain DLLs libeng and libmx.p  pWhen MATLAB is registered as a COM server, it writes its location into the registry and I can access it.  Using this information, is there a simple way to allow the Engine application to work without having to add MATLAB to the PATH  The Engine application could theoretically read the location of these DLLs from the registry, but the problem is that it wont even start up without those DLLs when compiled the standard way, according to MATLAB Engine compilation instructions.p  pI am not very familiar with winapi and not at all familiar with COM.p  pIs there an easy solution to let the problem find its DLLs based on the information from the registryp

Negative 8404 pI have a problem with a game Im making.  Basically I have a lot of fields, a basic type and other types. Logically I made derivatives of the basic field to add the extra functionality as needed. p  pHowever, it seems that when I call a function that is present in the base class, that function will be ran from the base class and not the derivative. p  pHere is some cutdown code so you can see what I mean. p  precodepublic class Field      public FieldField exitN, Field exitE, Field exitS, Field exitW, bool barricadeAllowed, int returnTo, int xPos, int yPos              Actual logic is in the constructor, but unrelated to the below function           public void Function              if this is StartField                      Debug.WriteLineStartField running base function                  Actual logic here.         codepre  p.p  precodeclass StartField  Field      public StartFieldField exitN, Field exitE, Field exitS, Field exitW, string color, int xPos, int yPos          baseexitN, exitE, exitS, exitW, false, 0, xPos, yPos              Again, constructor emptied due to unrelatedness.            public new void Function              Debug.WriteLineStartField function         Different logic then the base function      codepre  pCalling this funtion on a startfield object causes the startfield running base function to appear in my debug bar, but not the startfield function  This tells me only the base function is called even though the object knows it is of the type StartField. p  pIf it makes any difference, all fields are saved through links with other fields. The variables ask for the type Field, but all are allowed in the variables because inheritance  Can this in any way cause the call to go to the Field code rather then the StartField code or code of any other non standard field, since this seems to be the case with all fieldsp  pThere are 2 workarounds I can think of The first workaround I can think of is checking the type and casting the field to its actual type before running the function.  But were not allowed to use class is Field in the assignment. Plus it would require more code then needed for a simple function call. p  pThe second workaround also uses the class is Field functionality, namely programming all field type functionality into the base class.  Which not only uses class is Field but also just feels plain wrong childs should have their own functionality, doesnt make sense if the base has it all. Might as well go with a single class and have the type be a variable instead of an inheriting memberp
Negative 8404 pSo far as I understand it, messages are associated with commits. But when you look at a repo on GitHub it helpfully lists the message by each file, for when it was last changed.p  pId like to replicate that in a web view of a repo I have. Looking at the GitHub api it looks to me the only way to get that info is to download emallem the commits which can be paged, and work from the most recent ones assigning commit messages to the files in your local cache, going further and further back until youve got the message for every file, potentially to the very first commit, if any of the files have not been changed since the initial commitp  pQuestion is, is that the right way to do it Is that not going to kill even the 5000hr quotap

Negative 8404 pIm not new to Perl, but I use it far too rarely to learn everything one needs to remember.

Negative 8404 pIm designing a web page and I used HTML5 to make an entire div tag a link. Prior to adding the link, the whole div would expand when I hovered over it.

After going through and hunting down all of the screwed up files, I then pushed some changes I had made back to my remote working branch.p  pA week later now, and Ive added several other commits to an open pull request from my remote branch.  In the middle of them was the commit I made after fixing my local repo file permissions.  I noticed it has some 1200 empty files no changes.  Im a little concerned that merging this pull request upstream could cause big problems and I have no idea how to remove this one commit or if its even possible...p  pI tried creating a new branch and using cherrypick to get all but the one commit, but Ive removed files and couldnt merge the older commits that saw a conflict between the file that existed at the time and one that no longer exists in the local repo...p  pAnyway, any thoughtsp

Negative 8404 pI have a bunch of hierarchical data that Im trying to represent using HTML, JS, and JQuery. Ive decided to use a leftfloated div container system instead of a grid system to make the code easier to generate recursively. The problem is that I have some constraints for example, I want the width of the tree to fit exactly into the client window. I can accomplish this by dynamically setting the width for each div when its created in the JS. The width is calculated in percentage by counting the number of siblings an element has and diving 100 by that number of siblings.p  pThe problem with this approach is that it wastes a lot of precious space. Even if an element has no children, it gets the same amount of space as all of its siblings. Once you get down to level 4 or 5, space starts to become a serious commodity.p  pThe other approach Ive tried is to let the browser auto size everything. This is really nice because nothing gets any more space than it needs. The problem here is that I lose a lot of control over dynamic sizing I need to be able to zoom in and out, as well as start at exactly 100 width as I mentioned before. Also, when the tree grows beyond the width of the page, the overflown divs are shifting down. I need them to scroll off the page horizontally.p  pSo my question is... what options do I have for ensuring that my tree structure saves space, fits exactly in the client width, and allows for zooming via dynamic sizingp  pHeres a screenshot of the hierarchical datap  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshxl239fthmxss2dwyhHTUYq93 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comshxl239fthmxss2dwyhHTUYq93ap  pHeres a simplified example of the kind of code Im generatingp  precodeltdiv idmap classtagcontainergt     ltdiv classtaggtLevel 0 dataltdivgt     ltdiv classtagcontainergt         ltdiv classtaggtLevel 1 dataltdivgt         ltdiv classtagcontainergt             ltdiv classtaggtLevel 2 dataltdivgt             ltdiv classtagcontainergt                 ltdiv classtaggtLevel 3 dataltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classtagcontainergt                 ltdiv classtaggtLevel 3 dataltdivgt                 ltdiv classtagcontainergt                     ltdiv classtaggtLevel 4 dataltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classtagcontainergt             ltdiv classtaggtLevel 2 dataltdivgt             ltdiv classtagcontainergt                 ltdiv classtaggtLevel 3 dataltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classtagcontainergt                 ltdiv classtaggtLevel 3 dataltdivgt                 ltdiv classtagcontainergt                     ltdiv classtaggtLevel 4 dataltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd heres the related CSSp  precode.tagcontainer      padding 0px     float left     boxsizing borderbox     display inline     width 33.333   .zoom      cursor pointer   body      backgroundcolor azure     overflow scroll  codepre
Negative 8404 pI am trying to use ajax to generate pages on the client side, and so far I got two ideas of doing itp  ol lipI can load a page with basic DOMs, JS and CSS files from server, then I can make an ajax call to get data from the server and generate pages on the client side. pli lipI can load a completed page with JS and CSS files from server, and I can make an ajax call whenever users want to update the contents.pli ol  pI dont like either of the two methods both of them will have page templates in JS code. The first one is making extra an request to the server the second one requires me to make another copy of template in the php code.p  pIs there any suggestion to make the structure cleanerp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I feel maybe its good to generate the whole page at the server side when the page is not too big i consider a table with hundreds of rows is big and it cost a lot for server to generate all those html tags around the data, and in this case, you just need to use ajax to pull the page instead of getting json data from the server then generate the page.p

Negative 8404 pUsing Backgrid to show tables with two backbone Collections CollectionA and CollectionB which could contain large data maybe several thousand models.  Now that Ive got Backgrid handling the two collections nicely, I need to add a checkbox that will cause a filter to be applied to the Collection.  The filter involves some calculating its not just like color  red.p  pI could create a second, filtered copy of each Collection backgrid displays a collection, but Id rather not have to add listeners to handle new data that comes in from time to time.  Also, memory, copy time etc because the filtered version isnt necessarily small.  p  pQt has a thing called a ProxyModel which in my case would look like a Collection so Backgrid could connect to it but really goes between the Collection and Backgrid or any other View.  It would only give the Models that make it through the filter and it would take CRUD instruction.  Is there such a thing in Backbonep  pEach Model is less than 1K of content not counting the structural data in the ModelCollection so are my copy timememory concerns unneeded  I dont think so, any thoughts would be appreciatedp

However, if I donate the same item again, the table row is duplicated and the new donation is not subtracted from the required amount. I thought INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE may work, but I cant make sense of it. How can I get this table to display correctlyp  pEDIT to clarify, the reason I used COALESCE was because the donation table has nothing in it until someone donates something. Therefore the equation doesnt compute as the values in the donations table are null at first.p  pEDIT 2 I guess the question then becomes, when should I COALESCE in this situationp

Negative 8404 pHi im making a little program which can make lines, circles, squares and triangles inside a canvas. All this with a GC event and two points Sx,Sy and Ex,Ey.

Negative 8404 pSomehow I find this confusingp  pIf your activities and bound service run in the same process, and you want to communicate asynchronously between activity and bound service which is set to the foreground using a notification, how do you use handlers on both sides The part that I dont understand is that both the activityside and serviceside run in the same thread the UIthread. That means THE SAME HANDLERp  pI used to program it like this In my bound service I create a Handler, put that handler into a Messenger, return the Messenger in the onBind method. On the activityside I create a ServiceConnection object with onServiceConnected and onServiceDisconnected. I also create a client Handler and put that in a client Messenger object. I also define a service Messenger object which gets its Messenger object handed out in the onServiceConnected method of the ServiceConnection object. Everything is setup now.p  pI believe I could remove the whole Messenger part between the activity and service and only use a local binder object because the activity and the service run on the same uithread. That way you only have ONE thread for both sides and two handlers and two Messengers. Why have two handlersmessengers in the same thread Is that the ONLY way to get asynchronous communication I dont want to call methods in the service directly from the activity as you normally would do using a local Binder object, because that is synchronous communicationp

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.p  precodeIBActiondraggedoutidsender withEvent UIEvent  event              UIButton selected  UIButton sender             selected.center  [[[event allTouches] anyObject] locationInViewself.view]           ifCGRectContainsRectyellowBox.frame, selected.frame                      amountYellowBox  5             totalAmountYellowBox.text [NSString stringWithFormatCurrent Amount d,amountYellowBox]               codepre  pThanks,p  pRyan Wp

Negative 8404 pId like to use codeRESTKitcode not in the default way, which as far as I understand, is to update the cached objects by looking at unique IDs and either adding objects to the cache when new IDs are found or purging objects from the cache when old IDs exist.p  pWhat Id like to do instead is always fetch objects from a URL endpoint, set the cache with these new objects, removing all the previous existing cached objects. The thing is that my codeJSONcode doesnt have any unique IDs. p  pIs it possible to do this I unsuccessfully tried removing the objects in the cache before calling for new objects. Before I try too many other things, I thought Id ask here first if there is a standard way of doing this in codeRESTKitcode.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8404 pI was reading the following answer about What exactly does soreuseaddr dop  blockquoteThis socket option tells the kernel that even if this port is busy in     the TIMEWAIT state, go ahead and reuse it anyway.  If it is busy,     but with another state, you will still get an address already in use     error.  It is useful if your server has been shut down, and then     restarted right away while sockets are still active on its port.  You     should be aware that if any unexpected data comes in, it may confuse     your server, but while this is possible, it is not likely.blockquote  blockquoteIt has been pointed out that A socket is a 5 tuple proto, local addr, local port, remote addr, remote port.  SOREUSEADDR just says that you can reuse local addresses.  The 5 tuple still must be unique by Michael Hunter mphunterqnx.com. This is true, and this is why it is very unlikely that unexpected data will ever be seen by your server.  The danger is that such a 5 tuple is still floating around on the net, and while it is bouncing around, a new connection from the same client, on the same system, happens to get the same remote port.  This is explained by Richard Stevens in 2.7 Please explain the TIMEWAIT state.blockquote  pI just cant get the last lines codeThe danger is....TIMEWAIT state.code It says if there is still a same floating tuple on the net then....but what if is there the same tuple 1 hour later I cant understand, can someone explain itp

Negative 8404 pMy question is probably quite basic but something Ive never had to do before, so Im assuming its possible in Java Im sure it is and I just dont know how. Essentially I have 3 objects which I want to manipulate 3 codeBufferedImagecodes. For example I want to be able to change the brightness and contrast, which I can do. By doing this Ive had to create a separate method for each image where the code is exactly the same. For examplep  precodepublic void increaseBrightnessGreen      RescaleOp rescaleOp  new RescaleOp1.0f, 10, null     rescaleOp.filtergreenImage, greenImage     updateGreen  codepre  pWhich is then repeated for red and blue but then also duplicated 3 more times to decrease the brightness which is quite a lot of code which is doing very similar stuff. Of course, this applies quite frequently and the brightness example is just 1 of many, the methods to import the images are the same except for changing a few variables and contrast is similar to the above too. I dont know if it matters but all of my code is in one individual class.p  pAs I say, Im sure theres a way to reduce all this excess duplication of code, I just dont know how.p

Negative 8404 pHas anyone faced this feature request and were able to resolve it  We have a webapps that is capable of creating a form as a template.  That template will basically be called and user will need to fill out the form before it got push into the db.  So the form is created directly inside the application and the fields, labels and variables are all defined when the form is created by user using the apps.  Since the form is always going to be changing, I cant hardcode the activity in android and have to create it manually and recompile every time a new form is created.

Maybe this is a better example, how I want to use these 100 metersp  pSo, right now Im at the coordinate lat x and lon y. There is another point lets say a hotel at another given coordinate, lat a and lon b. My question is how can I calculate out, if this hotel is less than 100 meters from me So it doesnt matter, if its only 5 meters or 99 meters, both of them are less or equal than 100 meters far from me.p  pWith the code what I provided, I can calculate this out, thats what that formula is for.p  pBut lets say, I have a million of other coordinates hotel locations that I want to work with. And I need only a list of them, what are less than 100 meters away from me. So yes, thats a circle around me with a radius of 100 meters, and I need the results within that.p  pIt would take much more time and resource to take all the coordinates of these million hotels and calculate the distance one by one, thats why I thought it would be much easier to calculate out, how much 100 meters are in latitude and longitude changes the value as we are on different locations, that why I cant use simply the ones what I calculated out in the example above.  So if I would know how much 100 meters are in latitude and longitude for example at Londons coordinate if Im there, I could simply get the list of the hotels what are less than 100 meters far from me, by a simple dividingp  precodeif  hotelLocation.coordinate.latitude lt myLocation.coordinate.latitude  100metersInLatitude  hotelLocation.coordinate.latitude gt myLocation.coordinate.latitude  100metersInLatitude ampamp hotelLocation.coordinate.longitude lt myLocation.coordinate.longitude  100metersInLongitude  hotelLocation.coordinate.longitude gt myLocation.coordinate.longitude  100metersInLongitude     NSLogBe Happy    codepre  pI just need these 100metersInLatitude and 100metersInLongitude, calculated always from myLocation.p  pWhoa, I hope, somebody will understand what I just wrote down, because its not easy for me, neither... p

Negative 8404 pIm starting a new project and also trying to get a better understanding of OOP in PHP. What I really want to see in action is the pros and cons of emencapsulationem. My ideal goal is to see there is no emclasspropertyem exposed to the global scope, so there should be only emmethodsem publicly available to others, and they will rely on emprivateem or emprotectedem classproperties.p  pThe other thing that Im really looking into is to have a good eminheritanceem as well However Im facing difficultly on how to combine both at the same design  probably I have a wrong understanding or too much expectations from inheritance. To picture it better imaging the following structurep  ol liClass codeAppcode is the base class.li liI have a couple of other classes like codeStoragecode class also, which they all emextendsem codeAppcode class.li liUnderneath, I have a MVC structure as well. So I want to have access to codeStoragecode methods just inside of my codeModelcode class, ideally by getting use of eminheritanceem not emdependency injectionem for example.li ol  pNow if I want to have my codeStoragecode methods available to others, I can simply make a public property in the codeAppcode class and store the codeStoragecode instance in there, so every other class can simply access all the codeStoragecode methods, but I want to avoid it and implement a true encapsulation and see how it works in the real world.p  pOn the other hand I want to have a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSingleresponsibilityprinciple relnofollowSRPa on board as well. If I implement even just a single method in the codeAppcode class that somehow gives you access to the codeStoragecode class for example, then Im violating SRP, because thats not the business of codeAppcode class  codeAppcode cant see the child methods, so I need to provide a way of accessing it. p  pAlso in the above case, whenever I extend the codeAppcode in another class, then I have to come back to the codeAppcode class and provide some form interface to that class as well. That means touching an alreadyworking code and I think its not a good practice at all unless you want to debug the code, but not for adding features or even worst when youre extending that class by others.p  pSo the question is can I implement such a design without any compromise, and ideally in a battletested structurep

On this stack panel, I would like to add DataGrids to it whenever I please. Ill be able to do MyStackPanel.Children.addMyGrid. p  pNow, MyGrid could have an entirely different ItemsSource every time I add a new, unique Grid. But what I always want to stay the same between grids is the 2 columns  Title and Value.p  pAll of my data will be something like Dictionary myDatap  pThe String is the title, the int is the value.  I would like to have every grid that I add to have a unique myData applied to them. I can do this no problem if I setup 3 distinct grids on startup. But the issue lies in creating multiple grids on the fly.  Maybe the client wants 50 different DataGrids on 1 stack panel. I just want to ensure the formatting is the same for every grid with Title and Value without having to creating a static amount of grids in XAML for when the program launches.p  pSo I can gop  precodeDataGrid MyGrid  new DataGrid MyGrid.Style  MyXAMLStyle MyGrid.ItemsSource  MyData MyStackPanel.Children.AddMyGrid codepre  pinstead of doing something nasty like copying, which may be simple with 2 columns but increasingly becomes crazy.

Negative 8404 pCurrently I am developing a routing protocol in c for use in disruption tolerant networking. For this purpose, it needs to propagate copies of messages rather than the message itself over the network. To test its performance in a simple simulation, I have abstracted most factors, resulting in packets being simulated by simple structs containing a random data value, id, source and destination.p  pFor this protocol to work, I have defined the following class variablesp  ol licodestdlistltpacketgt buffercode  this list contains all the packets this node has available for transmission.li licodestdlistltpacketgt toTransmitcode  at each networking opportunity between 2 or more nodes, each node determines which packets should be transmitted, therefore this separate list of pointers is keptli licodestdlistltpacketgtiterator priorityixcode  transmission occurs in two phases, first priority packets are transmitted, with codepriorityixcode tracking the location in the codetoTransmitcode list.li licodestdlistltpacketgtiterator normalixcode  only after all priority packets have transmitted, can normal transmission begin, tracked by this iterator.li ol  pDue to a node receiving a priority packet it has to immediately forward, codepriorityixcode might be reset to the start of the list while normal transmissions need to continue from where it was interrupted, hence the need for two separate iterators.p  pNow for the weird behavior. Normally I use codeix  mylist.eraseixcode to delete the item I am currently pointing to, without having an invalid iterator afterwards. This has always worked for me, however something seems to go wrong in one specific method in my code. This method deals with ACKmessages received, which might result in deleting a packet where either or both of these iterators are pointing to.p  precodevoid NodereceiveAckuint packetid      stdlistltpacketgtiterator ix  stdfindbuffer.begin, buffer.end, packetid     ifix  buffer.end          ifpriorityix  packetid ampamp normalix  packetid              priorityix  toTransmit.erasepriorityix             normalix  priorityix          else ifpriorityix  packetid              priorityix  toTransmit.erasepriorityix                  else ifnormalix  packetid              normalix  toTransmit.erasenormalix                   else              toTransmit.removeampix                  buffer.eraseix       codepre  pWhat this method SHOULD do, is that it checks whether the two iterators are pointing to the packet to be deleted and make sure they get relocated before dropping the packet from both codetoTransmitcode and codebuffercode. By the way, in case people are wondering, I have written an operator method to compare packets with uints, allowing codestdfindcode to find the correct packet in codebuffercode, I have validated it does indeed enter the correct ifstatements with codeixcode having the correct value.p  pHowever, what instead happens is that upon calling the codestdlisterasecode function, it increments the iterator to the next valid location, but does not actually remove the element from the list, resulting in invalid pointers being stored in codetoTransmitcode causing SEGFAULTs somewhere later on.p  pI tried to work around the issue by just doing an codepriorityixcode andor codenormalixcode in the ifstatement, followed by codetoTransmit.removeampixcode after all statements. This clears the elements nicely from codetoTransmitcode, however if the incremented iterators was pointing to the last element in codetoTransmitcode, it will point to the same element after incrementing rather than to codetoTransmit.endcode, again leading to SEGFAULTs somewhere else in the code.p  pWhat is odd however, is that the codebuffer.eraseixcode seems to work normally. I am getting quite frustrated by the problem as I often use iterators and never seem to run into this kind of behavior. Any help or directions where to look at in the code is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8404 pI have been stock for a couple of hours now lol, not fun but this is why.. I have an app for typing which is to set the background of the button keyboard to a different colour lest say yellow like highlighted when typing or key is pressed each button will be highlighted and it will set the background back to white when release.. Well, my KeyListener I think that it doesnt has any focus but I seem to be losing something or not seen it where is that happening.. p  pI had to comment out the adding of the listener because give an exception of null pointer.. p  pI really hope someone can see what I cant or what I missing..

Negative 8404 pWhat Im basically trying to do is to map an array of data points into a WebGL vertex buffer Float32Array in realtime working on animated parametric surfaces.

Negative 8404 pIve recently learned about the advantages of using Dependency Injection DI in my PHP application. p  pHowever, Im still unsure how to create my container for the dependencies. Before, I use a container from a framework and I want to understand how is he doing things in back and reproduce it.p  pFor examplep  pThe container from Zend 2.I understand that the container make class dynamic, he doesnt have to know about them from begining, he checks if he already has that class in his registry and if he hasnt he check if that class exist and what parameters has inside constructor and put it in his own registry so next time could take it from there, practical is doing everything dynamic,and is completing his own registry, so we dont have to take care of nothing once we implement the container as he can give as any class we want even if we just make that class.p  pAlso if I want to getInstance for A wich needs B and B needs C I understand that he doing this recursive and he goes and instantiate C then B and finally A.p  pSo I understand the big picture and what is he supose to do but I am not so sure about how to implement it.p

Negative 8404 pI am using the gcc compiler Linux, gcc version is 4.8.2 for c programming. I am concerned with the template specialization of codestdnumericlimitsltTgtcode for floating point types codeTcode codefloatcode, codedoublecode, codelong doublecode. More specifically, I am interested in the value of the static member codestatic constexpr int digitscode of codestdnumericlimitsltTgtcode for floating point types codeTcode.p  pTo my knowledge, in the current C standard it says that the value of codedigitscode is the emnumber of radix digits in the mantissaem. I printed the value of codestdnumericlimitsltTgtdigitscode for the different floating point types on my machine floating point types implement IEEE754 according to the field codestdnumericlimitsltTgtisiec559code and I am a bit surprised about the result I.e. for codeTfloatcode it says code24code.p  pIt is my understanding that the emSingleem type i.e. codefloatcode has  according to IEEE754  a mantissa the significand of a floating point number of 23 bits while there is 1 sign bit and an exponent of 8 bits, so 32 bits total. So why is codedigitscode set to code24code The value of codedigitscode for codedoublecode is code53code instead of 52 number of bits in the mantissa for emDoubleem according to IEEE754.p  pProbably some subtle or not so subtle floating point issue, but Id like to know.p

Negative 8404 pI realize there are already questions on how to back up a repository and the answer is usually codegit bundlecode, but Id aiming specific setup.p  pId trying to periodically commit a snapshot of the current branch to another branch for backup purposes. Im using a batch file, and it looks like this Ive tried more variations than I can list herep  precodegit stash git checkout backup git add . git commit m Automatic Backup  Time   git push all origin git stash pop git checkout  codepre  pThe behavior Im aiming for is that each commit should be an exact snapshot of the current state of the directory, regardless of what branch I have checked out when I run it. If a newer commit changes a file, I want it to take precedence if a merge conflict arises.p  pIm not actually trying to merge branches, Im just trying to get the files as they exist at the time of the snapshot on the disk. So if branch A has a change on file A, and branch B has a conflicting change on the same file, but branch B is checked out, the backup branch should end up getting branch Bs changes, which are currently in the file on the disk, ignoring anything else. p  pAnd a practical example of what Im trying to do  Say Branch A has myfile.txt as Hello World, and Branch B has myfile.txt as Hello Dave.p  pWhen I checkout Branch A and open myfile.txt in a text editor I expect itd have Hello World. When I checkout B, Id expect it to have Hello Dave. p  pIf within one branch commit 1 had Hello World, and 2 had Hello Dave there wouldnt be a conflict. I want my back up branch to end up with commit 1 containing Hello World, and commit 2 containing Hello Dave assuming commit 1 occurred while I had previously checked out branch A, and branch B when commit 2 occurred.p  pI embelieveem git stash is the key to what Im doing, but it simply isnt working. I tried several different combinations of those commands, and all of them returned different variations off errors, at different points while the repo was in various states, so its really hard to summarize them. Id say my approach is probably fundamentally wrong, so the commands listed are there just to give a picture of what Ive tried so far.p  pBut no matter what I do I either get merge conflicts or nothing gets committed. What am I missing If theres any additional information I can provide, please let me knowp

Negative 8404 pYesterday I posted a question on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25541283howtofindaspecificvalueinmultidimensionalsessionarrayHEREa regarding a multidimensional codeSESSIONcode array I was working with to keep track of items in a shopping cart Im developing. One of the very helpful responses suggested I create the codeSESSIONcode array not as a multidimensional array, which I agree is a smoother approach.p  pThe codeSESSIONcode array is started when a user clicks any of the Add to Cart buttons on the store page. My original code with the multidimensional array is thisp  precodequantity  1   add first item from shop page ifissetPOST[additem] ampamp issetSESSION[cart]      SESSION[cart]  array     SESSION[cart][POST[productdescription]]  arrayquantity gt quantity, price gt POST[productprice]     headerLocation httpwebsite.comcart.php      codepre  pAnd this worked fine, but I was not able to achieve the results with this that I wanted see the other post.p  pThe code I was suggested to use is thisp  precodequantity  1   add first item from shop page ifissetPOST[additem] ampamp issetSESSION[cart]  SESSION[cart][]  arrayproductdescriptiongt POST[productdescription], quantity gt quantity, price gt POST[productprice] headerLocation httpwebsite.comcart.php  codepre  pAnd it works great and allows me to do what I want to do again, see the other post for details.p  pHOWEVER...p  pRegardless of which Add to Cart button is clicked on the store page there are only four, the FIRST click gets information added to the codeSESSION[cart]code array TWICE. Every other button clicked afterward is entered only once. And again, it does not matter which button is clicked first, this happens no matter what.p  pHeres the result of a codeprintrcode on the new codeSESSIONcode array codep  precodeArray      [0] gt Array                      [productdescription] gt iPhone case  Black             [quantity] gt 1             [price] gt 9.49               [1] gt Array                  [productdescription] gt iPhone case  Black         [quantity] gt 1         [price] gt 9.49        codepre  pI have scoured SO and Google for clues as to why this is happening, but no matter how I word my queries, I just cant seem to find anything that helps.p  pIt has to be something simple that I am missing...p  pSincere thanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pTo clarify, there are only 4 items on the store page. There wont ever be any more. To keep things super simple, each item has its own Add to Cart button. When the button is clicked, the user is taken to the cart page where they can adjust the quantity or delete the item then either check out cancel and clear the cart or continue shopping.p

Negative 8404 pAll of the following is in the PayPal sandboxp  pI have a PayPal subscriptionrecurring payment setup which uses a IPN listener as the last step to create or update a users subscription in my website DB. However, when I received the POST data from paypal and send it back for verification, the only response I receive is INVALID.p  pI know that my code sends the POST data back to PayPal correctly, because I get a VERIFIED response when I mimic a correct POST to my listener by hardcoding the POST data string with the IPN Message value as seen on the PayPals IPN History page.p  pSo my code that sends the POST data back to PayPal for final verification works, and my IPN listener is receiving the POST variables for the transaction. There is just a difference the POSTdata string my IPN listener creates to send back to PayPal and the POSTdata string that PayPal expects to receive.p  pPayPal states that the IPN listener must send back the POST data it receives with the same values, order, and encoding that PayPal sent it in.p  pI think the problem is an encoding issue because in the PayPal POST to my listener, charset has the value windows1252 which should be UTF8. However, formcharset has the correct value of UTF8.p  pI have set the encoding to UTF8 on both input fields on my seller PayPal profile, and have a hidden input in the initial PayPal formbutton with the name charset and value UTF8. Please tell me if there is another way to set the encoding that I have missed.p  pPart of the POST data string that PayPal claims to be sending includes ampnotifyversion3.8 followed by more variables. When I manually insert this string to test my code, the ampnot gets converted to  when printed to the page which to my understanding means that the character encoding being used is windows1252 because  is in the windows1252 character set, but  is not in the UTF8 character set, so if UTF8 was being used, the ampnot would not be converted like this.p  pHow can I get PayPal to actually POST data to my IPN listener with UTF8 character encoding Keep in mind that this is a recurring payment so some aspects may be different.p  pI dont think the issue is on my end, as I have tried different methods, different ways of encodingdecoding the posted data, external libraries, cUrlsockets, SSL on with different versions, different headers, restarting the server, recreating the purchase, etc. So Paypal is sending me the wrong POST data or I am forming the post string incorrectly. The latter is possible, but I have tried every method I could find for forming the post string and none worked.p  pI have been working on this problem for days to no avail, so any help or pointers would be very appreciated.p  pPS a few notes which may or may not be relevantp  ul lipThis subscription system was created a few months ago and only stopped working inexplicably at some point in the last few weeks. No relevant code was changed around that time AFAIK.pli lipThe first day I started debugging this issue, the seller account for the sandbox had completely incorrect data, it was listed as a personal account when it should have been a business account, which meant none of the IPN settings were available. The next day the same account inexplicably worked and showed up as a business account as it should have in the the first place. Im not aware of any action on my part causing this change. Maybe PayPal sending the wrong character encoding is a similar issue Some caching system on a cron job Im just speculating at this point, I really have no clue.pli lipRelating to my last point, logging into the seller sandbox account has been very unreliable. Sometimes I attempt to log back in after a session timeout and receive an error code which would only make sense in the context of registering a new account. Other times logging in just doesnt work, the result being that a fraction of the times I try logging in after a session timeout, I have to clear my cookies for logging back in to work.pli ul

Negative 8404 pSo I am interested in creating a custom nonlinear filter. My mask is a 3 by 3 matrix and what I want to do is take my center point and look at the values directly neighboring it excluding the diagonal elements. I want to subtract the middle element by each of those neighboringvalues and then find either the minimum of these values. Basically Im looking at elevation data and I want to find the smallest deltaZ to the middle point.p  pExamplep  pcodeZ  [64    21    31    59       38    30    92    26       81    47    43    60       53    23    18    71]codep  pSo lets say I was just looking at codeZ3,3code  43 for now. I would take 43 and subtract 92, 60, 18, and 47 yielding 49, 17, 25, and 4 respectively. Then I want it to only output 49. This process would repeat for every element in the Z matrix. How would I go about doing this Thanksp
Negative 8404 pI have a formview that is populated with an ObjectDataSource and it works great.  Nested in that is a gridview also populated with a nested ODS that works perfect 99 of the time.  Also nested in the formview is another ODS populated from the same control that populates the other nested datasource that works perfect all of the time.  Code below to make that make sense.p  pThe problem is if you change pages it all works fine most of the time.  There are 2 search features built into the page.  That is where the error occurs.  If you use either of them without changing pages it works great.  If you use one of them and then change pages and try to use either one of them the page crashes with an error that says something like Control Parameter X is not found in Y.  The problem is that it is not a true error because there is a button that displays the bootstrap model which displays its gridview with no issues and the ODS is based on exactly the same control so it is obviously there.  I imagine that it is related to the events, but they step through just fine.  I am not sure what could be causing it.p  pHere is a little test project that is basically the same setup only paging is setup in the formview and the ODS1 in the real project and it works perfectly.p  precodeltaspFormView IDFormView1 runatserver DataSourceIDObjectDataSource1gt     ltItemTemplategt         ImportantID         ltaspLabel Textlt BindImportantID gt runatserver IDImportantIDLabel Visiblefalse gtltbr gt         Name         ltaspLabel Textlt BindName gt runatserver IDNameLabel gtltbr gt         ltdiv idnestedContentgt             ltaspObjectDataSource IDObjectDataSource2 runatserver SelectMethodlistNested TypeNameTestProject.DataSourceClassgt                 ltSelectParametersgt                     ltaspControlParameter ControlIDImportantIDLabel PropertyNameText DefaultValue1 NameImportantIDFromOnject1ForNestedObject TypeInt32gtltaspControlParametergt                 ltSelectParametersgt             ltaspObjectDataSourcegt             ltaspGridView IDGridView1 runatserver DataSourceIDObjectDataSource2 AutoGenerateColumnsFalsegt                 ltColumnsgt                     ltaspBoundField DataFieldYetAnotherProperty HeaderTextYetAnotherProperty SortExpressionYetAnotherPropertygtltaspBoundFieldgt                     ltaspBoundField DataFieldOtherPropertiesGoInThisClass HeaderTextOtherPropertiesGoInThisClass SortExpressionOtherPropertiesGoInThisClassgtltaspBoundFieldgt                 ltColumnsgt             ltaspGridViewgt         ltdivgt         SomeProperty         ltaspLabel Textlt BindSomeProperty gt runatserver IDSomePropertyLabel gtltbr gt         SomeOtherProperty         ltaspLabel Textlt BindSomeOtherProperty gt runatserver IDSomeOtherPropertyLabel gtltbr gt         ltaspObjectDataSource IDObjectDataSource3 runatserver SelectMethodGetDataObject2 TypeNameTestProject.DataSourceClassgt             ltSelectParametersgt                 ltaspControlParameter ControlIDImportantIDLabel PropertyNameText DefaultValue1 NameImportantID TypeInt32gtltaspControlParametergt             ltSelectParametersgt         ltaspObjectDataSourcegt         ltdiv idBootStrapModalPopupgt             This displays the data with no problems         ltdivgt     ltItemTemplategt ltaspFormViewgt ltaspObjectDataSource IDObjectDataSource1 runatserver SelectMethodGetDataObject1 TypeNameTestProject.DataSourceClassgt     ltSelectParametersgt         ltaspParameter DefaultValue1 NameImportantID TypeInt32gtltaspParametergt         ltaspParameter DefaultValue NameName TypeStringgtltaspParametergt         ltaspParameter NameSomeProperty TypeStringgtltaspParametergt     ltSelectParametersgt ltaspObjectDataSourcegt codepre  pI would appreciate any ideas of where to look next.

Negative 8404 pIm trying to use codengrepeatcode on a codedivcode which should contain a star image, each pie in the JSON has a coderatingcode property from 15, and I want to use this value to loop out x number of stars. Ive got this working somewhat but its flawed in the way that I cant resort the array and make the stars follow the correct item in the list since Im using code[index]code to track the iteration. p  pMy solution is rather ugly as well since Im creating arrays with as many index placeholders as the value of the coderatingcode property, and then pushing this into an array to loop out the appropriate number of images.

Negative 8404 pI have a jsp page which implements jquery dialog functionality. I have implemented jquery dialog as a chat functionality.p  pThis jsp page displays online users and has other important functionalities  which self submits the jsp .p  pWhenever user clicks on one of the online user to initiate the chat, I open the dialog using following construct.p  precode    var divdata  ltdiv iddiv  opponentuserid  gtltdivgt     var d  divdata.dialog . . . .      d.dialogopen codepre  pThis is working fine. The problem is, if user starts performing any other functionalities my jsp is getting refreshed and I lose the opened dialog.p  pI would like to keep this dialog opened as long as user is on my jsp page.p  pI can think of following mechanisms to solve the problem but dont know if solution exists.p  p1 Master jsp which will load my current jsp and I would append strongdivsstrong to master jsp. But It appears that even master jsp get refreshed. p  p2 Load jsp in strongiframestrong and start appending strongdivsstrong outside the iframe.p  p3 Some magic with javascript which will allow me to associate dialog with session. p  pWhich one of the above is possible Are there any other solution which would allow me to have chat functionality  other than using jquery dialog p  pAny ideaspointerssamples will be helpful to solve this problem.p
Negative 8404 pI have been tasked with coming up with a svn structure for our transition to Agile that has to scale to multiple teams with multiple developers. After talking to my colleagues I had come up with the example structure seen below. I got a little bit of push back from other team members with legit concerns. I was hoping find out the best practices for having a svn structure among multiple teams when we all have to share a QA environment. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrfjCt.jpg altProposed SVN structurep  pIn my example above, you can see that I have used a lot of AgileScrum terms. I did this to help explain my decisions in why I came up with this structure. Essentially the main trunk will always only have stories from all teams that have met definition of done which includes QA. The main problem pointed out to me was that we have to share environments and for reasons, we cant virtualize these environments and because of this, releasing daily for QA testing would be hard as each team would be stepping over each other. Another issue they wanted addressed was that some did not want each developer to have their own branch as it would increase the amount of merging each teamindividual would have to do.p  pAt this point I am not sure what to do our how to respond. I was hoping that some peopleteams out here in SO land could tell us how they have theirs structured and what issues you have encountered because of your structure.p

I have the following codep  precodeset.seed12345 dataMatrix lt matrixrnorm400, nrow 40  set.seed678910 fori in 140   flip a coin coinFlip lt rbinom1, size 1, prob 0.5  if coin is heads add a common pattern to that row ifcoinFlip  dataMatrix[i, ] lt dataMatrix[i, ]  repc0,3, each 5   hh lt hclustdistdataMatrix dataMatrixOrdered lt dataMatrix[hhorder, ] imagetdataMatrixOrdered[, nrowdataMatrixOrdered1] heatmaptdataMatrixOrdered[, nrowdataMatrixOrdered1] codepre  pAs far as I have understood, the only difference between the 2 functions is that, the codeheatmapcode function does a cluster analysis to produce dendrograms for rows and columns. Hence the plots should look the same. Can someone please tell me why I see this difference I have attached the plots from the 2 functions.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGxynQ.png altPlot using heatmapimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWtHzp.png altPlot using imagep

Negative 8404 pSo to explain my attempt, I have a sudoku grid styled with css, and with some of the grids initialized with values. Then for any grids that dont have a value I am dynamically setting an input box. p  pThe part where I am stuck is how do I go about setting the values to the grid[] object, only after all the values have been filled in the sudoku.p  pIs this is a right approach, how do I check that all the td elements have an innerHTML value set to it and then initialize those values to the grid[i][j]. p  pHTMLp  precodelttable idgridgt     lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgt2lttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgt4lttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgt6lttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgt1lttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt      lttr classrowgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgt9lttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt         lttdgtlttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pCSSp  precodetable     margin 1em auto       trfirstchild         bordertopsolid           trnthchild3n td         borderbottom solid           td         height 25px         width 25px         border 1px solid         textalign center           tdfirstchild         borderleft solid           tdnthchild3n         borderright solid           td input         height 25px         width 25px      codepre  pJavaScriptp  precodewindow.onload  function     var grid  []     var obj  document.getElementsByTagNametd     forvar prop in obj         ifobj[prop].innerHTML               obj[prop].innerHTML  ltinput idvalue typetext value obj[prop].innerHTML gt                   setValuesgrid   function setValuesgrid     forvar i 0 i lt 9 i         forvar j 0 j lt 9 j            grid[i][j]                   codepre

The other two are just gone.p  pBut I guess my main question is that, should the example above work. If yes, would it be too much to ask of what could have happened. If not, is there a better wayp  pstrongEdit Thank you allstrongp
Negative 8404 pWe have written an angularjs web siteapp  optimised for mobilebr and are using cordova to make an html5 based mobile app.p  pThe code html, css, js will be the same for both the web app and cordova appbr but there will be some files that will be different.p  pHow do we set up our git repo to share only common files between the webapp repos and the cordovaapp repos p  pObviously any code.gitignorecode files are tracked and are common to all repos.  We could add all files we dont want in the cordova repo to code.gitignorecode but that will reduce the usability of 3 web app repos for the one cordova repo.p  pWeve triedp  ol lipHaving a local repo of the project for the cordova app with code.gitinfoexcludescode on that repo instead of code.gitignorecode files  but this only solves the problem for empushesem from that repo, not pulls from the origin which will cause errors with untracked filespli lipSetting up a different branch  and use a a hrefhttpswww.atlassian.comgittutorialscomparingworkflowsgitflowworkflowgit flow stylea approach for intermediate branch for merges  but its apparently a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29579546not possiblea to have an code.gitinfoexcludescode specific to a branch  so everything will get overwritten on each mergepli ol

Negative 8404 pIm looking for an answer that can help me emdesign a Table View for my message listem.  Users see a list of people they can message from a REST API, and if they click on one person, it takes them to a child for messaging. Once they unwind from that child, theyre brought back into the message list but that cell will be pushed to the top.  Pretty standard messaging.p  pMy REST API is standard pagination.  codewww.something.commessagesstart0ampnum20code .  I currently do pagination using codescrollViewDidScrollcode.  When the user scrolls to the bottom, I fetch the next 20 results and append it to the master array of objects.p  pThe problem Im currently facing is...how do you update the table and order of the cells without clearing the entire table and drawing it again Right now, in my codeviewWillAppearcode, Im clearing the table and fetching0, 20 every time.  This is obviously a problem, because if the user has 100 people on the list, scrolls down to message someone, goes to the detailed child view, and unwinds back, then my code will reset the entire table and the user will start at the strongtopstrong again horrible, with only strong20strong cells. They have to scroll down again....which is very troubling. p  pMy REST API orders cells by their last message time.  So, if someone scrolls down to message someone, goes to a child, send a message, and unwinds back to the list, that cell should be at the top. p  pWhen users get a push notification for an individual cell, I also want that cell to pop to the top, without changing any of the other rows.p  pHow can this be designed p  pHeres my codep  precodeimport UIKit   class Match User     var description String     var unread Bool     func setUseruserid String, fbid String, firstname String, descriptionString, unread Bool         self.userid  userid         self.fbid  fbid         self.firstname  firstname         self.unread  unread         self.description  description        class MatchesTableViewController UITableViewController  , UIScrollViewDelegate     let center  NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter     let queue  NSOperationQueue.mainQueue     var matches  [Match]     var roomOfMessages String     var toUserOfMessages User     private var loadingData  false       private struct Storyboard         static let CellReuseIdentifier  Match           override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad            override func viewWillAppearanimated Bool          super.viewWillAppeartrue          fetchMatches0, num CONSTANTS.MatchesNum              override func scrollViewDidScrollscrollView UIScrollView          let currentOffset  scrollView.contentOffset.y         let maximumOffset  scrollView.contentSize.height  scrollView.frame.size.height         if maximumOffset  currentOffset lt 0 ampamp matches.count gt CONSTANTS.MatchesNum.toInt              var start  Stringmatches.count             fetchMatchesstart, num CONSTANTS.MatchesNum                     func fetchMatchesstart String, num String         if self.loadingData              printlnFetching   start             self.loadingData  true             apiClient.listMatchesstart, num num  responseJSON gt  Void in                 dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue  gt Void in                     if start  0                         self.matches  [] reset the table.                                          forindexString, stuff JSON in response[data][users]                         var match  Match                         match.setUserstuff[userid].string, fbid stuff[fbid].string, firstname stuff[firstname].string, description stuff[description].string, unread stuff[unread].bool                         self.matches.appendmatch                                          if response[data][users].count gt 0                         self.tableView.reloadData                                          self.loadingData  false                                                   override func tableViewtableView UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UITableViewCell          let cell  tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierStoryboard.CellReuseIdentifier, forIndexPath indexPath as MatchTableViewCell         cell.match  matches[indexPath.row]         return cell           override func numberOfSectionsInTableViewtableView UITableView gt Int          return 1           override func tableViewtableView UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section Int gt Int          return matches.count           override func tableViewtableView UITableView, didSelectRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath          var match  matches[indexPath.row]         toUserOfMessages  match         do stuff         performSegueWithIdentifierCONSTANTS.SegueMatchesToMessages, sender view            override func prepareForSeguesegue UIStoryboardSegue, sender AnyObject          if segue.identifier  CONSTANTS.SegueMatchesToMessages              if let child  segue.destinationViewController.contentViewController as MessagesViewController                 if let messagesroom  roomOfMessages                       do stuff                                                 codepre

Negative 8404 pI have been reading about JSON Web Tokens and some questions popped up in my mind . I have read lot of claims about how we should move from session based approach to JWT. I am thinking more in terms of a strongNode JS backend that exposes API for the UI as well as the mobilestrong.p  pemClaim JWT does not require you to communicate with your keyvalue data store for every http request.emp  pstrongQuestion 1strong  I cant have a single private key for all the users Whats the security risk if I have only one Private Key . Then I would need to have a DB anyway.p  pemClaim JWT sends the token on every request.And hence we dont need to store any data like name,email on the session instead they can reside on the token itself.em p  pstrongQuestion 2strong  Wont the size of the payload increase , since they would be sent for every request and it also contains data p  pemClaim  You can use the same method for mobile auth as well as Web UI Auth.em p  pstrongQuestion 3strong  Since the server now has to decrypt the token and communicate to the server, isnt it an overhead for the Web UI p  pemClaim   Pass the token to the JS and store the token in sessionStorage or localStorage.em  p  pstrongQuestion 4strong  Since there is no concept of httpOnly in sessionStorage isnt it a security concern  Also can chrome plugins circumvent the security by getting the token and logging in p  pstrongFinallystrong, Apart from CRSF issue, sharing the code between UI and Mobile Auth and benefits CSRF, I really dont see much benefit over current session based mechanism. Am I correct in my thinkingp  pAlso, what are the cases what are the strongdisadvantages of JWTstrong when compared to the traditional session based systems p

Negative 8404 pI have a jQuery Single Page app that works but not the way I want it to. I have a list of counties that is read from a JSON file the list can be filtered. When one is chosen, it appears as a hyperlink that links to another page with a town from that county the page is actually just a div in the same page. The trouble is I have to manually create the divs beforehand. E.g if there are five items in the JSON file and I want to add one more, I have to manually add an extra div in the page. It works OK for the counties, I can add extra counties to the JSON and it builds an extra hyperlink but for the page it links to I need to create a new div in the html.

In particular it produces this error p  blockquote   pUncaught Error Invariant Violation setProps... You called codesetPropscode on a component with a parent. This is an antipattern since props will get reactively updated when rendered. Instead, change the owners coderendercode method to pass the correct value as props to the component where it is created.p blockquote  pThe situation is like this. The parent contains a child component.

The real antipattern.p  pBut now Im being told that I cant change my props. Or I have to throw out everything including the bathwater in order to have new props. Im not doing that my props contain the emcontentsem of the detail items. Maybe it is expensive to make another entirely new copy of this.p  pIm trying to let React participate in this rendering work to put the new height in. How am I supposed to even do this Is this error basically enforcing that Props are supposed to be immutable now The error is telling me that I have to involve this height even farther up on the component chain. I can conceivably do so with a callback from up above, but this feels very wrong. I need to pass information downward, not upward.p  pMaybe Im supposed to use codestatecode. But changing codestatecode forces codeWidgetcode, the parent component to render. That is not what I desire. Only one singular place in the DOM needs to rerender, that is the emchildem components divs codestylecode attr.p

Negative 8404 pWe are trying to implement a natural language search function using the IBM Watson Cognitive Insights CI service. We want the user to be able to type in a question using natural language and then return the appropriate documents from a CI corpus. We are using CI rather than the Watson QA service to avoid the need for training and to keep Watson infrastructure costs down i.e. avoid the need for a dedicated instance of Watson for each corpususe case.p  pWe are able to build the necessary corpus through the CI API but we are not sure which APIs to use in what order to accomplish the most preciseaccurate query possible. p  pOur initial thought was to p  ol lipAccept the users natural language question and Post that text string to the Identifies concepts in a piece of text API listed 6th from the bottom in the CI API Reference document to get a list of concepts related to the question.pli lipThen do a GET using the Performs a conceptual search within a corpus API listed 3rd from the bottom in the CI API Reference document to get a list of related documents back from the corpus.pli ol  pThe first question  is this the right way to go about achieving our objective described in the first paragraph of this post Should we be combining the CI APIs differently or using multiple Watson services together to achieve the objectivep  pIf our initial approach is the right one, then we are finding that when we submit a simple question e.g. How can I repair MySQL database corruption to the Identifies concepts in a piece of text API we are not getting a comprehensive list of associated concepts back.

Negative 8404 pCurrently, Im showing a really long text inside a codeRichTextBlockcode inside a codeScrollViewercode.p  pThe problem is since codeScrollViewercode doesnt support virtualization, loading the page takes a few seconds, and changing font size its an option for the user takes a long time and may even cause the app to crash.p  pOne solution came to my mind is to break codeRichTextBlockcode to a number of codeRichTextBlockcodes inside a codeListViewcode which supports Virtualization.p  pBut this approach has a little problem. Lets say I show each 500 lines of text inside a codeRichTextBlockcode. Now, the user may want to select and copy some text while itll work well in most cases, but hell never be able to select lines 498 to 503, because they are in two separate codeRichTextBlockcodes.p  pIs there any way to fix the text selection issue in this approach Or can you suggest a better way for implementing virtualizationp

Negative 8404 pI develop a C code whose main object will be called in a larger program. Only one instance of the object needs to be created within the host, so I have been declaring all class variables and methods as static.p  ul lipMy first question is a best practice question  is it a good idea to do so in term of performance, portability, maintainability p  pOn the one hand, the drawback with static members is that it becomes difficult to implement multithreading as these members would be shared by all threads. On the other hand, redeclaring all members as nonstatic would require to make some inheritances virtual, which brings to the second question.pli lipI know that virtual methods have their cost, but what about the virtual inheritance itself  Does virtual inheritance affect performances  pli ul  pThanks for your attention.p  pBest regards.p

Negative 8404 pIm working on a site that displays fantasy football stats. Every week of each season has its own table in the database 2014week1, 2014week2, etc. Every table has a row for each player with nearly 100 columns holding various information like the players name, team, position, and stats they acquired that week.p  pFor most of the website, I only needed to display a weekly breakdown of the players and the HTML table columns would look like thisp  pName  Team  Position  Stat 1  Stat 2  Stat 3  Stat 4 so on and so forthp  pThis is achieved with a simple select. But now I need a way to display every weeks data from a season in a table for a specific stat and position. The HTML table columns would look like thisp  pName  Week 1  Week 2  Week 3  Week 4  Week 5  Week 6 so on and so forthp  pI tried using UNION, but its not working exactly as Id like. I need a way to determine exactly which week the data is being pulled from. Currently, Ive got a table with a row for every player of every week, displaying their stat for that week, but theres only one column and the results are repeated. So, each week that a player plays it displays a row with that weeks stat instead of one row for each player and a column for each week.p  pIve seen similar topics here and elsewhere, but none of them really accomplished what I needed and I cant find enough information about my problem to troubleshoot it without advice.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated and if any additional information is required on my part, Ill be more than happy to oblige.p

Negative 8404 pSo I have an exercise that I should prove or disprove thatp  p1 if e is a minimum weight edge in the connected graph G such that not all edges are necessarily distinct, then every minimum spanning tree of G contains ep  p2 Same as 1 but now all edge weights are distinct.p  hr  pOk so intuitively, I understand that for 1 since not all edge weights are distinct, then its possible that a vertex has the path with edge e but also another edge e1 such that if weighte  weight e1 then there is a spanning tree which does not contain the edge e since the graph is connected. Otherwise if both e1 and e are in the minimum spanning tree, then there is a cycle p  pand for 2 since all edge weights are distinct, then of course the minimum spanning tree will contain the edge e since any algorithm will always choose the smaller path. p  pAny suggestions on how to prove these two though induction Not sure how to approach. p
