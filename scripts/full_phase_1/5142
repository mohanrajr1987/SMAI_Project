Positive 5142 pI am having an exception while trying to change orientation. I cant seem to get through this exception. the exception itself does not help because it keeps on pointing to the line of code that allows me to change orientation but the description says attempt to insert nil from objects[0] which indicates error in inserting to an array. I tried exception breakpoint and instruments in debugging. also had nszombie turned on. also made sure to check if nil before adding to an array or initializing an array. so i dont know anymore what could be the problem or what sort of action i would do to fix this. as for the array i have an array named arraydata that is initialized at viewdidload. when it is nil andor count lt 1. i call upon a af response that populates the array so it is made sure that it has content. also the logs are fine it returns count  0 always. anyways I hope someone can help here is the exception.

Positive 5142 pIve encountered an issue in Java trying to write to a file using FileWriter. Simply declaring codeFileWriter writer  new FileWriterfilelocationcode yields that there is an unreported IOException which must be caught.p  pTo rectify this, naturally I put my FileWriter within a trycatch block, but that causes an issue with scope. To fix this, I tried declaring the FileWriter before the try catch block and assigning the location within the try catch. After the try catch block when I would like to use the FileWriter, it tells me it may not have been initialized. Im not certain how else to handle this, and never encountered this issue in Java 1.7 or likewise.p  pThis is an example of my final situation in case I was unclearp  precodeScanner userInput  new ScannerSystem.in FileWriter writer try      System.out.printlnEnter the file directory you would like to store in     String fileLocation  userInput.nextLine     writer  new FileWriterfileLocation  catchjava.io.IOException e      System.out.printlnError message  writer.writeStuff writer may not have been initialized codepre

Positive 5142 pIm using springdatajpa to readwrite to my DB.  Ive read through the documentation for springdata and the one thing that I cant seem to locate is how it handles exceptions.p  pI am looking to catch any type of exception thrown by a repo action.  Is there a way of doing this short of just wrapping the individual repo action in a trycatch and catching any RuntimeException  Id rather avoid that as that is an even larger catchall than Id like.p  pDoes springdata wrap all exceptions in its own SpringDataException or something similar  Ive looked through the springdatacommons jar as well as the springdatajpa jar and didnt find anything applicable.p

Positive 5142 pI am trying to understand how interrupts work in an ARM architectureARM7TDMI to be specific. I know that there are seven exceptions Reset,Data Abort, FIQ, IRQ, Prefetch abort, SWI and Undefined instruction and they execute in particular modesSupervisor, Abort, FIQ, IRQ, Abort, Supervisor and Undefined respectively. I have the following questions.brbr 1. When the I and F bits in CPSRstatus register are set to 1 to disable external and fast interrupt, does the other 5 exceptions are also disabled brbr 2. If the SWI is not disabled when I and F bits are enabled then, is it possible to intentionally trigger a SWI exception within ISR of an external interruptbrbr 3.When any interrupt is triggered saving the CPSR to SPSR, changing the mode is done by the processor itself. So, is it enough to write the ISR handler function and update the vector table with the handler addressesI dont want to save r0 to r12 general purpose registers brbr 4. Whenever the mode of execution is changed does context saving happens internally by the processoreven when we change the mode manuallybrbr 5. How to maskdisable a SWI exception brbrbr Thank you.p

It doesnt work in Firefox or Opera Firefox does nothing, Opera complains the URL is invalid.li liI dont have a Windows box handy atm so Im unsure if computershare works in anything apart from IE e.g. Firefox  Opera.li liIf you have a better idea for consolidating a bunch of random samba shares it certainly cant get much worse than mine  its worth knowing that there is no guarantee that any of the servers I would be wanting to index  consolidate would be up at any particular moment. Moreover, I wouldnt want the knowledge of what they have shared lost or hidden just because they werent available. I would want to know that they share foo but they are currently down.li ul

Negative 5142 pFirst time Stack Overflow poster. Please bear with me p  pI have a set of codeUITextFieldcodes whose keyboard appearance I set in Interface Builder.

However, whenever I call coderesignFirstRespondercode on any of these text fields to dismiss the keyboard, the keyboards appearance defaults to codeUIKeyboardAppearanceDefaultcode as it slides out of view. 1 Is there somewhere else that I need to set the appearance of the keyboard, 2 is this a bug with Interface Builder, or 3 am I just out of luck While it isnt a huge deal, it is slightly jarring to suddenly see the keyboard change style as its sliding down. Note that this behavior does not exist when the keyboard is sliding up into view as a result of my text fields becoming the First Responder, so its a bit perplexing. Any insightp

Negative 5142 pIm doing maintenance on an asp.net web app that uses remoting to call a remote server object to order a credit report. The call works on my machine but throws an exception could not load file or assembly choicepointClue when run from the production server which is running the 64 bit version of the .net framework.p  pI resolved the issue by copying choicepointClue.dll to the bin directory of the web app. But I dont understand why it needs to be there as its a dependency of the remote server library not the client.p  pThe dependency tree looks like thisp  pWeb app  choicepointClueClient  choicepointRemoteAgent  choicepointCluep  pThere is no interface defined for the class in the choicepointRemoteAgent library as there should be so it is referenced directly by choicepointClueClient.p  pA class from choicepointRemoteAgent is instantiated using Activator.GetObject. Its at this point that I would expect choicepointClue.dll  to be loaded on the remote server instead of  the runtime trying to load it from the bin directory of the web app.p  pOne crackpot theory that crossed my mind is that there is a difference between how assemblies are loaded on x64 vs x86.p  pSo on x64 it tries to load choicepointClue as soon as it loads choicepointRemoteAgent, where on x86 it doesnt try to load chiocepointClue until its explicitly calledp  pObviously I have no idea whats going on here.

Negative 5142 pIm building a website that has a layout similar to a hrefhttpmaps.google.com relnofollowGoogle Mapsa a header, a sidebar on the left and a map on the right.p  pOn the Google Maps website, when the content of the sidebar exceeds the height of the screen, a vertical scrollbar appears next to it e.g. if you type restaurant in the search box. Im trying to achieve a similar effect and have tried various options, but nothing seems to work the right way. Setting the height of the sidebar to codeautocode or code100code does not work since the sidebar does not start at the top of the page  the vertical scrollbar is either too short and does not reach the bottom of the page in the case of codeautocode height or too long and exceeds the height of the page in the case of code100code height. I think Google uses JS to calculate the height of the sidebar.p  pAny ideas on how I can get this to workp

Negative 5142 pIm designing an API for the first time, and trying to follow SOLID guidelines. One of the things I find myself struggling with is balancing OCP and testability with simplicity and ease of extensibility.p  pThis opensource API is geared toward scientific modeling and computation. The aim is that various groups will be able to easily import their particular models into this pluggable architecture. Thus, its success as a project will depend on the ease by which these scientists can impart their domainspecific knowledge without unnecessary overhead or too steep of a learning curve.p  pFor example, our compute engine relies on vectorized computations  we rarely need just one scalar value computed. Many models can take advantage of this and perform overhead calculations to be reused in each scalar subcomputation. BUT, Id like a user to be able to define a simple scalar operation which will inherit or otherwise be provided with a default vectorization behavior.p  pMy goals were to make itp  p1 as simple as possible for novice user to implement their basic computational model 2 as simple as possible for advanced user to override the vectorization behaviorp  p...of course while maintaining SoC, testability, etc.p  pAfter a few revisions, I have something simple and objectoriented. Computation contracts are defined via interfaces, but users are encouraged to derive from an abstract ComputationBase class that will provide the default vectorization. Heres a scaleddown representation of the designp  precodepublic interface IComputationltT1, T2, TOutgt      TOut ComputeT1 a, T2 b   public interface IVectorizedComputationltT1, T2, TOutgt      IEnumerableltTOutgt ComputeIEnumerableltT1gt a, IEnumerableltT2gt b   public abstract class ComputationBaseltT1, T2, TOutgt      IComputationltT1, T2, TOutgt,     IVectorizedComputationltT1, T2, TOutgt      protected ComputationBase         the consumer must implement this core method     public abstract TOut ComputeT1 a, T2 b       the consumer can optimize by overriding this dumb vectorization      use an IVectorizationProvider for vectorization capabilities instead     public virtual IEnumerableltTOutgt ComputeIEnumerableltT1gt a, IEnumerableltT2gt b              return             from ai in a             from bi in b             select Computeai, bi        public class NoobMADCalculator      ComputationBaseltdouble, double, doublegt       novice user implements a simple calculation model      CalculatorBase will use a dumb vectorization     public override double Computedouble a, double b              return a  b  1337        public class PwnageMADCalculator      ComputationBaseltdouble, double, doublegt      public override double Computedouble a, double b              var expensive  PerformExpensiveOperation         return ComputeInternala, b, expensive           public override IEnumerableltdoublegt ComputeIEnumerableltdoublegt a, IEnumerableltdoublegt b              foreach var ai in a                       example optimization only perform this operation once             var expensive  PerformExpensiveOperation             foreach var bi in b                              yield return ComputeInternalai, bi, expensive                                 private static double PerformExpensiveOperation  return 1337       private static double ComputeInternaldouble a, double b, double expensive              return a  b  expensive       codepre  pFor the vectorized Compute in ComputationBase I had originally used a provider pattern via constructor DI, but kept the scalar Compute as abstract. The rationale was that this was good protected variation  the base class would always own the vectorization operation, but delegate the computation to the injected provider. This also seemed generally beneficial from a testability and vectorization code reuse standpoint. I had the following problems with this, howeverp  p1 The heterogeneity of the approaches for scalar inheritance and vector provider computations seemed likely to confuse the user, seemed overly complex for the requirements, and just had bad code smell.p  p2 Creating a separate provider for the vectorization was a leaky abstraction  if a provider was to do anything smart, it would typically need inside knowledge of the class implementation. I found myself creating private nested classes to implement them, which told me it was a concern that couldnt be separatedp  pIs this a good approach wrt OCP vs testability vs simplicity How have others designed their API for extension at various levels of complexity Would you use more dependency injection mechanisms than Ive included Im also just as interested in good general references on good API design than I am answers to this particular example. Thanks.p  pThanks, Davidp

I need to add a few sections in here to execute a query to return a dataset and display this in the same report.  I am not sure if the best way to do this with a subreport.  I am trying to add a subreport and then set the datasource of the subreport to my dataset, but I cannot get it to work.p  pIs this even the proper way or I am just doing something wrongp  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pEDITp  pExample of what I am looking to do.p  pLets say there is a customers table.

Negative 5142 pIm creating a big form with a lot of input fields.

Negative 5142 pI have another programmer who Im trying to explain why it is that a UI component should not also be a datastructure.  p  pFor instance say that you get a datastructure that contains a recordset from the database, and you wish to display that recordset in a UI component within your application.p  pAccording to this programmer who will remain nameless, hes young and Im teaching him..., we should subclass the datastructure into a class that will draw the UI component within our application  p  pAnd thus according to this logic, the recordset should manage the drawing of the UI.  p  pemstrongemHead Deskstrongp  pI know that asking a recordset to draw itself is wrong, because, if you wish to render the same datastructure on more than one type of component on your UI, you are going to have a real mess on your hands youll need to extend yet another class for each and every UI component that you render from the baseclass of your recordsetp  pI am well aware of the cleanliness of the of the MVC pattern and by that what I really mean is you dont confuse your data the Model with your UI the view or the actions that take place on the data the Controller more or less...okay not really the API should really handle that...and the Controller should just make as few calls to it as it can, telling it which view to render  But its certainly alot cleaner than using datastructures to render UI componentsp  pIs there any other advice I could send his way other than the example above  I understand that when you first learn OOP you go through a stage where you where just want to extend everything.  p  pFollowed by a stage when you think that Design Patterns are the solution every single problem...which isnt entirely correct either...a hrefhttpwww.codinghorror.comblog200509headfirstdesignpatterns.html relnofollowthanks Jeffa.p  pIs there a way that I can gently nudge this kid in the right direction  Do you have any more examples that might help explain my point to himp

Negative 5142 pstrongMy Questionstrong  I want the text of a TextView I have in a custom ListView to marquee scroll ONLY when the item is selected in the ListView. When the list item loses focus, I want the marquee to stop scrolling. I know that I need to set the TextView to enabled strongsetEnabledtruestrong for scrolling to work however when I do this as items are added, they ALL scroll, which is not the behavior I want but it does make sense why this happens. I tried setting them programmatically using the click handler of the ListView to set the TextView to enabled strongsetEnabledtruestrong, keep track of the current selected item in a private variable, then conversely setting the previous Views TextView enabled status to false when a new item is clicked and so on. I hope this makes sense. Heres some Java code that might better illustrate itp  precode    private View tempListItemView  null      if this.tempListItemView  null         TextView tempTxtView  TextView tempListItemView.findViewByIdR.id.txtArticleTitle        tempTxtView.setSelectedfalse        tempTxtView.setEllipsizeTruncateAt.END           Set marquee of currently selected list item     TextView tt  TextView v.findViewByIdR.id.txtArticleTitle     tt.setEllipsizeTruncateAt.MARQUEE     tt.setSelectedtrue     tempListItemView  v  codepre  pThis does work, sort of. However, its a little clunky. For example if the previous item leaves the display it never gets turned off and when I select the list item, I lose all of the custom listSelector properties I have set see below. Also, Ive had some other odd behavior with the background item of the scrolling TextView changing to black and even the entire ListView listSelector disappearing entirely. None of this occurs when I use the keypad on my Droid. It works as it should, however Im just trying to emulate this functionality when list items are pressed.

Negative 5142 pI have been looking into how you could use Javascript to direct focus to a Flash movie.  Ive seen it discussed on Stack Overflow and other sites and it seems you cannot do this reliably except in Internet Explorer.  I am just calling the .focus method on a Flash object via Javascript.p  pIt does in fact work in Internet Explorer, but I dont like its behavior on Firefox or other browsers.  Basically, I have a usernamepassword login field INSIDE my Flash movie, and I want to give it focus when the Flash movie loads, so you can start typing your username immediately, without having to first click the field.p  pThe problem with Firefox is that not only does it not set the focus, you can SEE a blinking cursor inside the field in Flash, which really indicates that the field has focus.  However, you still have to click.p  pThis is counterproductive on Firefox.  I would rather not even attempt to set the focus if this is the behavior.  I could of course check what browser is in use and determine whether to even call .focus, but this functionality may change in later versions of Firefox.  Id love to have a better solution, that wouldp  ol liRemember the current focus before the Flash movie is dynamically added to the page this is how I do it, I cannot display the movie as part of the initial page load.li liAttempt to set focus to the Flash movie.li liCheck if the focus WAS properly set, so I can expect that the Flash movie is actually receiving keystrokes without an additional click.li liIf focus was not set, revert to whatever was focused before the Flash movie was loaded.li ol  pI am not sure how or if this can be done but Id love to find out.  I think document.activeElement may be useful, but I was not able to get very far with that.  Thanks for any helpp

A process handle is also a number that uniquely identifys a process kernal object.p  pWhy do we need them both since either of them can identify a process.p  pI think the answer may lie in the mapping relationship betweeen a process and a process kernel object. Is it true that more than one process kernel objects can be mapped to a single process And each process kernel object has its own process handle.

I decided to leave 3d because i figured i just didnt and couldnt understand the coding involved, Im pretty good at math though, so i figured i would give it another shot.p  pIm trying to learn 3d XNA in c, Ive recently worked out 2d and wish to move on, my problem is that with in my opinion the most basic of 3d shapes, a cube, i run into problems, after successfully exporting my cube from blender after the 7th try  and importing it into XNA, I cant get a texture to correctly show on the cube, so i downloaded a cube model from a sample source code file, and attempted to use that, and its default texture, and i still have problems.p  pBasically, the code to draw the cube isp  precodeforeach ModelMesh mesh in model.Meshes                              GraphicsDevice.RasterizerState  RasterizerState.CullClockwise                 foreach BasicEffect effect in mesh.Effects                                       effect.TextureEnabled  true                     effect.Texture  texture                     effect.World  world                     effect.View  view                     effect.Projection  projection                     effect.LightingEnabled  false                                   mesh.Draw              codepre  pThe RenderState and LightingEnabled are new, attempting to fix if myself, When i use my own texture, the texture looks like its being stretched, and isnt showing the entire image on the cube, but all faces look the same, so its not wrapping it.p  pAlso, to see all the faces i rotate the cube likep  precode position  new Vector30, 0.00f, 0.0100f             angley  0.01f             anglez  0.01f              world  Matrix.CreateScale1.5f  Matrix.CreateRotationZanglez  Matrix.CreateRotationYangley  Matrix.CreateTranslationposition codepre  pThe z change is so i could test another theory.p  pThe default texture is a sandish texture, Im not sure if its streatching, because its almost a solid color, but the box itself seems to be oddly represented it looks as though i can see through the near faces, and im looking at the backs of the opposing onesp  pIm hoping someone can give me a hand, it just seems like it should be much simpler then It seems to be, to draw a simple textured cube, and most of the tutorials online are from older versions of XNA, so the code doesnt match up, and i get lost when trying to replace it with current code On tutorials that create a cube in code, rather then a model.p  pAnyways, thanks for any answers.p  pEDIT Drawing this cube with CreateOrthographic makes it look correct the first one uses perspective but still no texture love p  pEDIT2 when i use my cube its stretched, when i use the one from the source, its a solid color.p  pEDIT3p  pI probably would have gotten an answer sooner had i mentioned i was displaying FPS using a fontspritebatch, when i was working out why it wouldnt work, and comparing it to a sample that DID work, i found it, Now, does anyone know how to make that workp

Negative 5142 pIntuitively, it would seem that given a dozen or so 2d images from different angles of almost any object, it should be easy to construct a 3d representation of that object.

Negative 5142 pI would like to make a generic function that deserializes a byte array into a type specified by the caller. I feel that a really intuitive way to call such a function would look something likep  precodebyte[255] myData  [...] String myUnserializedString  new PacketltStringgtmyData.unpack  byte[4] myInt  [...] int myUnserializedInt  new PacketltIntegergtmyInt.unpack codepre  pAs a user, this is the kind of interface Id like to be offerred. The problem is that obviously each type has to be unserialized in a different way. This means that the unpack method has to perform some kind of reflexive test to choose the right way to interpret the raw bytes.p  pAfter trying for a little while to write a prototype for such a class, I am beginning to feel that Generics may not be the right tools for that kind of design.p  pAre theyp

Negative 5142 pI was hoping that I could achieve some guidance from the stackoverflow community regarding a dilemma I have run into for my senior project.  First off, I want to state that I am a novice programmer, and Im sure some of you will quickly tell me this project was way over my head.  Ive quickly become well aware that this is probably true.p  pNow thats thats out of the way, let me give some definitionsp  pstrongProject Goalstrong The goal of the project, like many others have sought to achieve in various SO questions many of which have been very helpful to me in the course of this effort, is to detect whether a parking space is full or available, eventually reporting such back to the user ideally via an iPhone or Droid or other mobile app for ease of use  this aspect was quickly deemed outside the scope of my efforts due to time constraints.p  pstrongTools in Usestrong I have made heavy use of the resources of the AForge.Net library, which has provided me with all of the building blocks for bringing the project together in terms of capturing video from an IP camera, applying filters to images, and ultimately completing the goal of detection.  As a result, you will know that I have selected to program in C, mainly due to easeofuse for beginners.  Other options included MATLABC,  C with OpenCV, and other alternatives.  p  pemstrongThe Problememstrongp  pHere is where I have run into issues.  Below is linked an image that has been preprocessed in the AForge Image Processing Lab.  The sequence of filters and processes used was  Grayscale, Histogram Equalization, Sobel Edge Detection and finally Otsu Threshholding though Im not convinced the final step is needed. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comu6eqk.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comu6eqk.jpga p  pAs you can tell from the image with the naked eye of course, there are sequences of detected edges which clearly are parked cars in the spaces I am monitoring with the camera.  These cars are clearly defined by the pattern of brightened wheels, the sort of double railroad track pattern that essentially represents the outer edging of the side windows, and even the outline of the license plate in this instance.  Specifically though, in a continuation of the project the camera chosen would be a PTZ to cover as much of the block as possible, and thus Id just like to focus on the side features of the car eliminating factors such as license plate.  Features such as a a rectangle for a sunroof may also be considered but obviously this is a not a universal feature of cars, whereas the general window outline is.  p  pWe can all see that there are differences to these patterns, varying of course with car make and model.  But, generally this sequence not only results in successful retrieval of the desired features, but also eliminates the road from view important as I intend to use road color as a first litmus test if you will for detecting an empty space... if I detect a gray level consistent with data for the road, especially if no edges are detected in a region, I feel I can safely assume an empty space.  My question is this, and hopefully it is generic enough to be practically beneficial to others out there on the site  p  pstrongFocused Questionstrongbr Is there a way to take an image segment via cropping and then compare the detected edge sequence with future new frames from the camera  More specifically, is there a way to do this while allowing leewayessentially creating a tolerance threshhold for minor differences in edgesp  pemPersonal ThoughtsBrainstorming on The Questionembr  Im sure theres a way to literally compare pixelbypixel  crop to just the rectangle around your edges and then slide your cropped image through the new processed frame for comparison pixelbypixel, but that wouldnt help particularly unless you had an exact match to your detected edges.  p  pAll help is appreciated, and Im more than happy to clarify as needed as well.p

Negative 5142 pAs a follow up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4824536isthereanygoodwayforaninlinefunctiontoaccessprivateorinternalvaluesthisa question, I am wondering whether it is possible to mark an F function within a module presumably via an attribute as hidden from Intellisense. To recap, I have some functions which are marked codeinlinecode but are implemented in terms of other functions I dont really want to expose. So while the implementation functions must be kept public since they are being inlined, I remember that in the past Ive come across C methods which were hidden from Visual Studio Intellisense but compiled just fine if you knew what they were, but I dont remember the exact methods and am unsure if that was some sort of adhoc Visual Studio thing or a usable feature like codeDebuggerBrowsableDebuggerBrowsableState.Nevercode awareness.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I tried applying the codeEditorBrowsableEditorBrowsableState.Nevercode but it doesnt appear to work in Visual F projects.p

For example, in Michael Sipsers Introduction to the Theory of Computation, he proves a special case of the Recursion Theorem, which states that any program representing a function that accepts two strings and produces a string can be converted into an equivalent program where the second argument is equal to the programs own source code.  Moreover, this process can be done automatically.p  pThe construction that one uses to produce programs with access to their own source code is wellknown most theory of computation books contain it and is often used to generate quines.  My question is whether someone has written a generalpurpose tool that accepts as input a program in some language perhaps C, for example that contains some placeholder for the source of the program, then processes the program to produce a new program with access to its own source code.  This would make it possible, for example, to generate quines automatically, or to write programs that can introspect on their syntax trees possibly enabling reflection in languages that dont already support it.  If not, I was planning on writing my own version of such a tool, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel if this has already been done.p  pstrongEDITstrong Based on Henning Makholms suggestion, I decided to just sit down and implement such a program.  The resulting program which Ive dubbed codekleenecode accepts as input a C program and produces a new C program that can access its own source code by calling the function codekleeneMySourcecode.  This means that you could transform this very simple program into a Quine using the codekleenecode programp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  int main      stdcout ltlt kleeneMySource ltlt stdendl  codepre  pIf youre curious to check it out, its available a hrefhttpwww.keithschwarz.comkleene relnofollowhere on my websitea.p

I mistakenly thought a hrefhttpalgs4.cs.princeton.edu44spAcyclicSP.java.html relnofollowAcyclicSPa becomes Dijkstras algorithm when removing the topological sort which is not the case.p  pHowever, my question about Dijkstras algorithm using the version shown above remains.  Why cant it be used even if there is a negative weight so long as there are no cycles  There is a java version of a hrefhttpalgs4.cs.princeton.edu44spDijkstraSP.java.html relnofollowDijkstras algorithm herea.  Mine is very similar to this since this guys book is where I learned about it but his example is probably easier to read for some of you.p
Negative 5142 pFor a site Im planning, I need the server to be able to send commands to a loggedin users browser. p  pSimplic example When a call center rep gets a call, I want to automatically pull up the lead who is calling in.p  pIve got the rest of the technology sorted out and I need to get a sketch together of how the actual communication to the browser will work. p  pFrom my research so far, this is often done with desktop software or plugins, but that feels pretty old school at this point. I emknowem it can be done with javascript, either by writing something that constantly polls the server for commands this could work, but it feels a little wasteful and brute forcey or by some other technique that gives the server a way to call out to the client.p  pSomething like whatever mechanism stackoverflow uses to tell you new answers have arrived on the current question would probably do the trick.p  pSo is there a known best practice What worked for youp

Negative 5142 pI want to display a textarea without a scrollbar while maintaining the scrolling behaviour. As the user types I just want the upper lines to disappear off the top of the text box.p  pI can achieve this in IE and Chrome using overflowhidden.

Negative 5142 pI have an array of shape l,m,n. Im trying to calculate a distance matrix of shape l,m,n where entry i,j,k is the coefficient between vectors i,j, and i,,k.  I havent found anything in numpy or scipy that fits the bill.p  pI tried using a for loop and iterating along axis 0, then feeding that to scipy.spatial.distance.pdist, but that takes a long time as pdist itself uses a nested for loop.  In essence, what I would like to do would be to perform pdist down axis 0, but ideally make it so pdist doesnt use for loops either....p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 5142 pI have a question about parsing performance, when using clanglibclang and particulary function clangparseTranslationUnit and clangreparseTranslationUnit.p  pIm trying to optimize the process, but Im really out of ideas already.  The situation is following  I have a .cpp source, that includes a lot of header files. This headers change very seldom. However the .cpp source changes a lot and I need to reparse it often. So, there is a possibility to preparseprecompile all the headers and create .pch file, and then use it when parsing .cpp. However, the problem is that, I can use only one .pch. So, I need to create a .pch from all the included headers. However, later, when I include some other header file, I need to reparse all the headers, even though they hadnt changed at all. Also, this is problem, that I need explicitly know, what headers are included in the .cpp this is not very convenient, as this would mean, I have to scan at least for includes myself, and then create a .pch and then use it, when parsing the .cpp source.p  pIs there any other option to optimize the process I hoped that, when I use clangparseTranslationUnit and later clangreparseTranslationUnit, the parsing will be optimized in this way actually at least all the headers, that hadnt changed, do not need to be reparsed again. But, it doesnt work like that.p

Okay, so there are multiple passes. What exactly happens on each pass and how does Java manage to compile so quickly Does it have to reparse each file on each pass, or does it store the abstract syntax tree to save time, or whatp
Negative 5142 pstrongBasic Ideastrong I have a flash file that takes screenshots with a click of a button, sending the data to a PHP file, and then the user gets to save a PNG image.  The images that are merged together via PHP require that they reside on the same server as the PHP, otherwise they do not merge and the final PNG shows up blank.p  pstrongMy solution so farstrong I have two PHP files, and I just need to find a way to merge them.  The screenshot one, and one that copies a file from one server to another.  This is my cheat work around to bring the image to reside on the same server, THEN run the screenshot php.p  pstrongThe ServertoServer PHP Codestrongp  precodeltPHP  inputfile  FOPENhttpswww.google.comintlencomimagessrprlogo3w.png, r outputfile  FOPENtransferedfile.gif, w ECHO File opened... data    WHILE FEOFinputfile    data .

I can get this PHP code to work by saving this as whateverIWant.php on my webserver, and visiting it directly, but I need to in place of Googles logo in this example put a value that will be dynamically changing via flash.p  pSo basically in the flash file, Ill have a dyniamic variable where the URL will change, in short.

This is unfortunate because the images Im loading are of different sizes. But if I dont specify the Rect, the image doesnt appear when running the app. If I make the image big enough as in the example, the image does appear, and it gets resized to fit my control, but the polygon coordinate system doesnt seem to match.p  pAlso, Ive used StringFormat to put an M in front of the Geometry specification, so that it comes out like this M50,50,12,50,30,30,30,100,100,100. If I specify that explicitly, the polygon appears, but if I bind it with the same string, the polygon doesnt appear.p  pNot sure if those two problems are related to one anotherIll have to reevaluate when either of the two is fixed.

Negative 5142 pIve employed two different scroll related effectsamong other javascript on one of my websitesa hrefhttpwww.kiirstinmarilyn.com relnofollowKiirstinMarilyn.coma and they appear to be interfering with each other.  They are as followsp  ol liCenter the logo and navigation on the screen while ensuring all content is below the fold.li liThe first jQuery effect makes clicking the nav links scroll smooth to the anchor text.li liThe second jquery effect, and what I added today, uses a hrefhttpwww.wduffy.co.ukblogkeepelementinviewwhilescrollingusingjquery relnofollowWilliam Duffys methoda to keep the music player element in view while scrolling.li liThe last element is employing nivoZoom for the pictures.li ol  pThe website is fine when the width of the browser window is more then 876px wide which is the width of the main content 574px  the music player 302px.  The problem occurs when the width of the browser is 876px or less.  For some reason, when the browser is less then that amount wide the William Duffy scrolling method also effects the content and it scrolls down out of view.p  pIve searched trying to find both alternate methods to create the effect I desire while also looking for information as to certain components of these effects might be interfering.  Unfortunately I havent found anything.  That said, what I am thinking of doing as a last resort is disabling the scrolling effects if the width of the browser is less then 876px.  Its less then ideal so I hope you all can advise me as to where my errors are and point me in the direction to learn to fix them.p  pThanks Kindly, Chadp

Negative 5142 pI have a QTableView which has some QString based items in its model.  I implemented setData in my table model, so editing is working I can change the data in the cell, setData is called to update the model, and the table is properly updated.p  pCurrently setData is only called when the user is done with editing, e.g. after they hit Enter or click out of the text entry box to finalize the text entry.  I want to update other other parts of the table while the user is typingediting into the text edit control instead of after theyre done and the edited contents are finalized.  p  pA simple example of what I want to have is for the next table cell to display a count of how many characters have been entered into the cell being edited, but to do this as the user is typingediting the cell contents, not just after the edit is finalized and setData is called.p  pAny pointers to what I should be looking for  Thanksp

Negative 5142 pSo Im having an iPad specific problem in Safari it also seems to happen sometimes on the iPhone, but either sporadically or its just not severe enough to notice.p  pBut I have a page with 5 audio players all html5 and they all start within a div with display none. Clicking on the title changes the display to be display block and the player pops up with an unfinished html 5 player. This works everywhere sans old IE of course and even works on the iPad.p  pHowever, when clicking on the title the entire page gets blurred out on the iPad. Ive tried playing with the code and it seems the problem is loading a div from none to block that has an html5 audio file within it. I even changed it so it only displayed the standard controller and I removed all of my extra code and the issue persisted.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on thisp  pThe link for the website is a hrefhttpartferretti.compaulperrysoundrecordings relnofollowhttpartferretti.compaulperrysoundrecordingsap  pheres a link to an image from the iPad a hrefhttpartferretti.comblurrediPad.png relnofollowhttpartferretti.comblurrediPad.pngap

Negative 5142 pIm writing a pretty simple database application, which I want to be locally stored as opposed to looking up a remote database. I like HTMLJavascript for designing interfaces, and theyre crossplatform everybody has a browser, so Id really like to write a webpage as a frontend. No clientserver interaction should be involved  I just want the users to be able to interact with the database using a browser, instead of a native program.p  pHowever, the only way I can see to access databases from a browser is using something like WebSQL or IndexedDB. Both of these, however, abstract away the process of managing the database file itself, and store it away in user settings somewhere. I want to distribute the database file itself along with the app.p  pIn short is there a way to use HTMLJavascript to modify a local SQLite database file Or is HTML not the tool I should be using for this sort of applicationp  pemEDITem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions877033howcanicreateanlocalwebserverformypythonscriptspossibly relevantap

Below is a longer explanation.p  pI have a page Control.aspx where I am loading templatescontrols based on query string parameters.  I access this page through a JQuery AJAX GET request to render this templatecontrol inside a container on another page Default.aspx.  Because of this, I can end up having Control1, Control2, and Control3 all on codeDefault.aspxcode.  I would like the buttons of Control1 to post back to codeControl.aspxid1code, the buttons of Control2 to post back to codeControl.aspxid2code and so on, and I want events to be fired as they would normally.  I dont have access to the controls contained on the Control.aspx page except when they are rendered on Default.aspx.  I also have to avoid iframes because of their inability to scroll cleanly on mobile safari.  I can give more detailed information if its needed.  Thanks for any help you can provide.p

Negative 5142 pI have the absolutely strangest bug Ive ever encountered, and Im near my wits end on this one.  Anyone with ideas on how to debug this or any clever workarounds would be awesome.p  pThe problemp  pIm making a simple WYSIWYG editor in Firefox using contenteditable.  The problem appears when I load the text to edit via ajax.  Before the load, the cursor appears fine for a split second, and once the text loads it disappears.  You can still enter text, and the cursor is definitely still there a status box shows the current linecol just fine, but the cursor is not visible and the selection overlay does not appear.  p  pHeres what makes this really strange  clicking ANYWHERE, on any other dom element, on firebug, even on another window  makes the cursor return and behave like normal.  In fact, the only time the cursor has any problems is at the very beginning, when initially loading the page or on refresh.  Clicking anywhere inside the contentedtiable div does not fix it  you have to click outside for it to refresh.  p  pRight now, I just need a workaround.  Ive tried 500 flavors of someelement.click or somelement.focus, but they dont fully replicate an actual click from a user.p  pHas anyone seen anything like this before  Thanks.  p

Ill try again by revealing the application, perhaps the abstraction is making it hard to visualize...p  pThe start dates represent dates on which we receive advice to buy a share. The end dates are dates on which which we received advice to sell it. The sources of advice are different and we are backtesting what would happen if we used the buy advice from one source, but the sell advice from another.  Thus we have two sequences of dates which we want to resolve into pairs  or intervals  over which we would have held a position in the stock.p  pThus we take a date from the startdates buy the stock. So on Nov 5 we buy a position. Now we work through the enddates looking for when we wouldve first been told to sell it  Dec 14.  Now repeat by waiting the buy advice, then the sell advice. So you alternate the lists to get a logical sequence of date pairs.  If at the end were holding an open position we note that by using codeNonecode or supplying a special date to close with.p

This new Session contains exactly one attribute the key is org.apache.cayenne.remote.service.HttpRemoteService.ServerSession and the value is who guessed it the session created before in step 1 What makes me wonder is that my serveltListener dont gets triggerd though a new session gets created. p  p3.Client executes line 4 from abovep  precodeListltObjectgt someEntities  context.performQueryallMovies codepre  pat the serverside now the getServerSession method is called again. This time also a new session gets created why. And this session does not contain any attribute. So the line return ServerSession httpSession.getAttributeSESSIONATTRIBUTE inside the method getServerSession returns null and exactly this triggers the exception No Session associated with request.p  pSo why is the cayenne serverside creating e ne session and doesnt use the old one created befor Do i have to explicitly send the session within the queryp  pEdit I made screenshots from the netbeans httpmonitor while running the four lines of code from above img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyTs3M.jpg althttp monitor tomcat cayennep

Negative 5142 pI am using the libxml2 libraries to parse XML sent to me my program as a file from another program.  With care that should mean that I never get bad XML, but twice already Ive made hand tweaks that broke the XML in the received file.  By broken I mean that the elements have errors, end tags not matching start tags, random characters in between tags, etc.p  pThe file is small so there are no particular memory worries about loading all of it into the parser, so I use  xmlReadFile to read in the doc.p  pMy problem comes when the XML is broken.   xmlReadFile does an abend and core dumps.  I cant catch it with an exception nor does setting the flag to recover work.p  pIve looked at Google with minimum success.  I found xmllint, but I really would like not to have to call system or popen every time I get a new XML file.  I looked at DTDs but cant seem to figure out how to tell a DTD to actually validate the value passed in a .  Many of the tags in the doc have values that are one of a set of, say, 5 possible answers.  Of course, if DTD worked I at least wouldnt crash the  xmlReadFile.p  pAny suggestions on how to validate the XML before  xmlReadFile or with  xmlReadFile and how to prevent the crashes  Does xmllint have a C interface that I just havent foundp  pNo boost.  No changing libraries.p

Negative 5142 pIve a producerconsumer setup Our client is giving us data that our server processes, and our client is giving data to our server by constantly writing to a file. Our server uses inotify to look for any file modifications, and processes the new data. p  pProblem The file reader in the server has a buffer of size 4096. Ive a unit test that simulates the above situation. The test constantly writes to an open file, which the file reader constantly tries to read an process. But, I noticed that after the first record is read, which is much smaller than 4096, an error flag is set in the ifstream object. This means that any new data arriving is not being processed. A simple workaround seems to be to call ifstreamclear after every read, and this does solve the issue. But, what is going on Is this the right solution Any pointers will be very much appreciated.p

Negative 5142 pI am new to C but as I understand it is bad to use the codeusing namespacecode keywords in header files.

Negative 5142 pI am building a proxy server in c and Im trying to understand the codeselectcode function.

However it doesnt compile. The compiler error seems to be related to a missing type or namespace. I tried to surround my ruby class between the module rubyindotNettest01 block but no success. p  pIm confused, maybe theres only one small detail Im not doing properly, or maybe this approach isnt meant to work at allp

Negative 5142 pI just got done setting up a little template project using spring, hibernate, and jboss. I thought I had a good basic template until I got into work today, and learned about connection pooling and JNDI. I understand the concept of connection pooling, but I have no idea where to get started with config files, or server configuration, or even custom java files. I went to my boss today to ask him about it, and he started talking about the mysqlds.xml file which I saw in one of the example folders located in the jboss application server folder. I also noticed that he wrote a custom datasourcefactory java file which reads a config file and depending on if one of the config elements says JNDI or C3P0, it will create a connection from it. I tried to google around, but I cant find a good example on how to get this setup.p  pHere is my current applicationcontext file that creates the hibernate sessions and datasourcep  precode ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltbeans xmlnshttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xmlnstxhttpwww.springframework.orgschematx     xsischemaLocationhttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans        httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeans.xsd   httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontext    httpwww.springframework.orgschemacontextspringcontext2.5.xsd   httpwww.springframework.orgschematx    httpwww.springframework.orgschematxspringtx2.5.xsdgt      ltbean iddataSource         classorg.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSourcegt         ltproperty namedriverClassName valuecom.mysql.jdbc.Driver gt         ltproperty nameurl valuejdbcmysqllocalhost3306examplezeroDateTimeBehaviorconvertToNull gt         ltproperty nameusername valueroot gt         ltproperty namepassword valueexamplePassword gt     ltbeangt      ltbean idmySessionFactory         classorg.springframework.orm.hibernate4.LocalSessionFactoryBeangt         ltproperty namedataSource refdataSource gt         ltproperty nameannotatedClassesgt             ltlistgt                 ltvaluegtcom.example.domain.administrative.user.Userltvaluegt                 ltvaluegtcom.example.domain.administrative.role.Roleltvaluegt                 ltvaluegtcom.example.domain.administrative.team.Teamltvaluegt             ltlistgt         ltpropertygt         ltproperty namehibernatePropertiesgt             ltpropsgt                 ltprop keyhibernate.dialectgtorg.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialectltpropgt                 ltprop keyhibernate.showsqlgttrueltpropgt             ltpropsgt         ltpropertygt     ltbeangt      ltbean idtransactionManager         classorg.springframework.orm.hibernate4.HibernateTransactionManagergt         ltproperty namesessionFactory refmySessionFactory gt     ltbeangt      lttxannotationdriven transactionmanagertransactionManager gt ltbeansgt codepre  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pUPDATEp  pI added values to the mysqlds.xml file and put it in my deploy folder.

Negative 5142 pI feel like the question is mostly in the title, but to go more in depthp  pMy manager is really pushing MVVM in all of our WPF apps, but today I was asked to dynamically create certain controls in order to achieve a more generic solution to a problem.  For some reason this seems contradictory to the MVVM patterns he preaches.  The whole idea is to separate the View from the Model right  Or am I missing something herep  pAny clarification is appreciatedp

Negative 5142 pI have a for loop iterating through a variable number of draggable elements, creating a stopevent callback for each. The callback function needs to know the index of the item that it is linked to.p  pIve encountered what I think is a closure problem when the callbacks are fired off, the state of the loop iterator index variable that gets passed to the callback x is the last value of the loop iterator index, rather than the value of that iterator index at the time the callback function was defined. Some coffeescript belowp  precodefor x in [0..total]   window.ready .draggablex.draggable     cursor move     handle .draggableimagemovebuttonx     containment divbannerbuilderpreview     stop gt       alert x  x codepre  pIn the example above, the alert prompt will always print x  total1 rather than x  0, x  1... etc. p  pWhats the best solution to pass a unique index to the callback for each of the elements that have a stop event I would prefer to do this without resorting to yet another jquery selector to pull more data from whatever element fired off the callback.p  pUPDATEp  pAnother problem Im now running into my callback, within the for loop, cannot see other functions defined in the file. I think thats very odd, even if the definition happens before the for loop is used to create the anonymous callback functions.p  pFor examplep  precodefor x in [0..total]   do x gt     window.ready .draggablex.draggable       cursor move       handle .draggableimagemovebuttonx       containment divbannerbuilderpreview       stop gt         someFunction x   ... this line throws an exception, not defined         alert x  x codepre
Negative 5142 pWhen I run a hrefhttppytest.org relnofollowpy.testa in my project directory tests are run twice. However  codepy.testcollectonlycode collects only once. And so I have 413 items collected of which 31 are marked to skip DBfile using. When I run the test without codecollectonlycode I get 826 tests with 62 skipped, sometimes a few less.p  pEdit I discovered that it only happens when running from within bash script. I printed the command just before it is run codepy.test libpython lcode. When I do the same from interactive shell I get correct result too.p  pEven closer look at the script in the middle of this edit revealed that empty  is actually passed as an empty parameter and is equivalent to codepy.test libpython l code, which causes incorrect behaviour and any parameter fixes it like codecollectonlycode did.p

Negative 5142 pI have a self hosted WCF service, using basic http binding. I am finding that calls made to the wcf service, accessing functions exposed by the WCF, take much much longer to complete internally than when using the functions directly from the wcf service.p  pSo to clarify, I am not talking about taking longer over the wcf call. Once the internal exposed functions behind the WCF are run, they, in their own processing, take much longer to do their work and return something back to the wcf service, for sending to the client, than when I access those same functions directly from a form in my hosted wcf app.p  pI have added extensive logging, logging start and stop time for all functions, and it seems to be consistent. The same functions, when activated through WCF, seems as if they are run at a much lower priority than when calling them bypassing the WCF interface.p  pTaking this into account, I am pretty sure this started sticking its head out after I decorated my main wcf class with the following, due to my UI thread locking upp  precodeltServiceBehavioruseSynchronizationContextFalsegt codepre  pAre the threads created due to the above decoration, running at a lower priority p  pstrongDirect Call from form in WCF hosted Appstrong 5 secondsp  pstrongCall Through WCF Interfacestrong 2030 seconds Excluding time over the wirep  pThe physical return from the WCF service itself, once the internal functions are complete, is quite quick.p  pI do quite a lot of work once the internal functions are reached.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp  pBasic WCF Service Codep  precode        Dim myservicehost As ServiceHost         Dim myServiceAddress As New Urihttp amp LocalIpAddress amp  amp tcpport amp  amp servicename          myservicehost  New ServiceHostGetTypemyWCFFunctions, myServiceAddress           Enable metadata publishing.

Negative 5142 pI have a Windsor service and two components implementing it One being the real service, and one being a proxy implemented as a decorator that routes the call either to the real service, or to a webservice.p  pNow the ideal situation would be that if the proxy DLL was found, the proxy would be used as a decorator. And if it doesnt exist, all calls would go directly to the real service.p  pIm currently using FromAssembly.InDirectory to register the components, and this works like a charm. However, I think this only works because the assemblies happen to be named in the correct alphabetic order, so that the real service is registered before the proxy decorator. Please correct me if Im wrong.p  pThis doesnt look very robust to me. Is there a better way to do it without manually configuring every single component in a config filep  pId either like a configuration file where I would only list the assemblies in the correct order, and all components from those files would be registered automatically just like FromAssembly.Named.p  pOr  and that would be even better  some mechanism that automatically figures out which component is the decorator after all, it has a dependency on the service it implements, whereas the real service doesnt, and which one is the real service, and then automatically registers them in the correct order.p  pI could of course implement the latter logic myself, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel.p  pAny suggestions will be highly appreciated. Thank youp  pstrongEditstrong This is what I have so far.

Negative 5142   pAs the title implies, is there a proper way to set some initial CSS properties or class and tell the browser to transition these to another valuep  pFor example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJhuy6fiddleap  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar el  document.querySelectordiv,     st  el.style st.opacity  0 st.transition  opacity 2s st.opacity  1 codepre  pThis will not animate the opacity of the element in Chrome 29Firefox 23.  This is because a hrefhttpblog.alexmaccaw.comcsstransitionssourceap  blockquote   p[...] youll find that if you apply both sets of properties, one immediately   after the other, then the browser tries to optimize the property   changes, ignoring your initial properties and preventing a transition.   Behind the scenes, browsers batch up property changes before painting   which, while usually speeding up rendering, can sometimes have adverse   affects.p      pThe solution is to force a redraw between applying the two sets of   properties.

Negative 5142 pThe error handling HttpModule has code in it to redirect the user to the appropriate error page, but it is not doing that, instead it is displaying the error page with the technical details including the stack trace.p  pI am maintaining a web app under Visual Studio 2008 and it was previously running fine when working on it under Win XP, but we have since moved onto Win 7 and I have ran into this issue when the user does not have the correct permission to view the selected data. I have added the necessary changes to make the app work under IIS 7, including adding the HttpModule to the codeltsystem.webServergtltmodulesgtcode section of the codeWeb.configcode file. Im wondering if there is something else that is missingp  pHere is the problem in detail I have a Web Form that makes use of an ObjectDataSource which calls a method GetAppData in a C service layer code file to display data to the user. The service layer file checks to if the user has the correct permissions to view the data, and since they dont, it throws an codeInvalidPermissionExceptioncode. This then triggers the ApplicationError method to execute in my error handling HttpModule which catches the error and should redirect the user to the codeInvalidPermissionError.aspxcode page however, what I am seeing instead is the error page with the technical details and the stack trace.

Until now there are no known memory leak problems with the external code, so I am guessing that the problem is with me in the code I sent here. Unfortunately I am not able to find the mistake. I tried to free about any variable manually that is mentioned in the code, but this always lead to a MATLAB crash As I see it Matlab tries to free the variables itself and crashes if there are not in memory anymore.p  pThe memory leak is critical here After about 7 steps in the loop there is already about 1 GB RAM occupied and it goes up to about 13 GB RAM in my test case. This is not plausible for the program so a memory leak seems very probable.p  pI also tried to find a fix in stackoverflow but everything mentioned here does not seem applicable to my scenario.p  pAs the memory leak is very huge the variables that are most plausible as they contain the most content are firstSeq, sndSeq, firstNodes, sndNodes, distanceTable, opts and obj.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liHave I forgotten to free one of those variablesli liDo you see something else that could cause a memory leak in the codeli liHow can I fix thatli ol  pAs far as my research goes the objects dont have to be freed as they are managed automatically. Still Somewhere memory has to be leaking.p  pstrongeditstrongp  pAs requested I provide also the code of my helper functions.

Of course, both are sharing large amounts of code so I moved the core functionality into an android library project.

But when compiling the final apps I realize the apps size more than doubled compared to the library project.p  pAs I changed almost nothing besides the code layout I cant explain why this happens.

I need a quicker way to track this down if possiblep  precode0libobjc.A.dylib 0x37c00ba6 objcmsgSendstret  5 1UIKit 0x30082e7d ltredactedgt  292 2UIKit 0x2ffb7641 ltredactedgt  372 3QuartzCore 0x2fbedbb9 ltredactedgt  100 4QuartzCore 0x2fbd743f ltredactedgt  1854 5QuartzCore 0x2fcb0425 ltredactedgt  52 6QuartzCore 0x2fbd6cf3 ltredactedgt  82 7QuartzCore 0x2fbd699b ltredactedgt  1106 8QuartzCore 0x2fbba67d ltredactedgt  208 9QuartzCore 0x2fbba315 ltredactedgt  24 10QuartzCore 0x2fbb9d1f ltredactedgt  230 11QuartzCore 0x2fbb9b2f ltredactedgt  314 12QuartzCore 0x2fc0e825 ltredactedgt  516 13IOMobileFramebuffer 0x3283b76d ltredactedgt  104 14IOKit 0x2e4a6a75 IODispatchCalloutFromCFMessage  248 15CoreFoundation 0x2d784e21 ltredactedgt  136 16CoreFoundation 0x2d78f9df ltredactedgt  34 17CoreFoundation 0x2d78f97b ltredactedgt  346 18CoreFoundation 0x2d78e14f ltredactedgt  1398 19CoreFoundation 0x2d6f8c27 CFRunLoopRunSpecific  522 20CoreFoundation 0x2d6f8a0b CFRunLoopRunInMode  106 21GraphicsServices 0x3241f283 GSEventRunModal  138 22UIKit 0x2ff9c049 UIApplicationMain  1136 23Movies 0x00116497 main main.m14  136343 codepre  pAny ideasp  pBy the way, this is why codeltredactedgtcode is shown p  pa hrefhttpsbugsense.zendesk.comentries27780998IveuploadedthedSYMbutIstillseemostlinesincrashreportswithredactedAmIdoingsomething relnofollowhttpsbugsense.zendesk.comentries27780998IveuploadedthedSYMbutIstillseemostlinesincrashreportswithredactedAmIdoingsomethingap

Negative 5142 pI am trying to keep my images safe by having an encryption on them.  Ive used an encryption program called AxCrypt to encrypt my images, but it changes the image file extension.

I am using HTML and Classic ASP to code the page, when I see it in a browser, the image comes out blank.  p  pMy reasoning for this is because I need to put the images on a server, but need the images to remain secure and inaccessible by other users, but would still need to show the images on my web page.  Is there any way to keep my image files secure but still source and use them on my web pagep  pThanks in advance Jasonp

Negative 5142 pWere building a site using Entity Framework and ASP.NET MVC, and Im currently working through our models ensuring that all of the string properties have the appropriate validation attributes, and its getting to be rather tedious.p  pMost of the time, our views are populated from view models  POCO classes that are defined to provide backing data for specific views. In the rarer cases where we are using EFgenerated classes to populate views, were using the MetadataTypeAttribute to specify a metadata class for each.p  pIts common for us to have a number of view models wrapping the same EF classes  exposing those parts of them that are used in a specific view. So its common for us to have the same properties appearing many times across different models. Which means we need to specify identical StringLengthAttributes in multiple places. And if we accidentally specified different string lengths, for the same property in different models, itd be an error that wed not be able to easily catch.p  pWhat Im wondering is whether we could use the MetadataTypeAttribute  that instead of specifying separate validation attributes on every property, everywhere, we created a single metadata class with proper attributes for every property we use across the system, and applied it to each of our models with the MetadataTypeAttribute.p  pWould there be any problems in specifying properties in a metadata class that werent in the class it was applied to Everything compiles fine, but thats no guarantee of issues.p  pWhat happens when attributes are applied to a property in the main class and to the matching property in the metadata class Are they all applied If the same property is applied to both, which one prevailsp  pItd be easy enough to test how things work in my current version of .NET, but Ive learned not to trust that, very much. Im much more interested in what is defined behavior that I can count on not to change in future versions, than in what works at the moment.p  pAnd beyond whether this will work, is it a good ideap

Negative 5142 pFirst of all, I have no experience with php.p  pI installed wikimedia software in order to parse wikitext markup strings to html. Thus, I set an Apache server localhost and I am parsing the wikitext using codeapi.phpcode from Pyhton requests library.p  pEverything is working fine, but the point is that I would do the same using a RPC, or in other words, calling codeapi.phpcode script from command line.p  pWhen sending the request the query isp  precodehttplocalhostmediawiki1.22.5api.phpactionparseamptextABCampformatxmlampdisablepp1 codepre  pThis query parse the codeABCcode text.p  pI would do the same from the command line, and I tried different things, likep  precodeshellgtphp api.php actionparseamptextABCampformatxmlampdisablepp1 or shellgtphp api.php actionparseamptextABCampformatxmlampdisablepp1 ... codepre  pThe reason I am trying to call from command line is that since I am running the server locally, maybe executing directly the script will make things much faster, beyond the fact that I can use other PHP engines, like Facebook HipHop, transparently, I mean, without having to configure the web server.p  pMaybe the best solution should be to write a simple wrapper script in php which calls api.php internally and converts command args to url gets. Unfortunately, since I am a complete layman in PHP I dont know how to code it.p  pAny help herep  pP.S Below the php.api source codep  precodeltphp    This file is the entry point for all API queries.

It then invokes execute on the ApiMain object instance, which   produces output in the format specified in the URL.

My app is an email client that displays HTML email, and here is what a typical email from GMail might look likep  precodeltdiv dirltrgtltdiv id teamid21062 dirltrgtltdiv idemailbodycontainer stylewidth96 padding0 margin2 bordersolid 1px E7E7E7gt   ltdiv idemailbodyheader stylewidth94 padding3 3 2 3 backgroundcolorf5f5f5 borderbottomsolid 1px eaeaeagt     ltimg srchttpwww.google.comadwordshtpstaticlegacyadwordslogogrey166x28.png altGoogle AdWords width166 height28 styleoutlinenone textdecorationnone msinterpolationmode bicubic displayblockgt   ltdivgt ltdivgtltdivgt codepre  pI have that exact HTML in a file named ctest.htm, and I load it in IE by entering that in the address bar, and then I load it in the webbrowser control using codeNavigatectest.htmcode, and they dont render the same.p  pI know it isnt valid HTML because it doesnt even include an html tag, body tag, etc, but this is how GMail does things and I have no control over that or other weird stuff email clients do.  The only thing I do know is that Internet Explorer always seems to display them nicely probably most people test with IE, thats why.  However, they dont display nicely in the WebBrowser control.  Here is the above HTML in IE10 Win8 and in a simple WinForms app using the WbeBrowser controlp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLofhi.png altenter image description herep  pThe WinForms app has a scrollbar when one isnt needed, and also the border doesnt match the background color size.  Using IE developer tools I can try every combination of Browser Mode IE7 through IE10 and every combo of Document Mode standards, quirks, IE7  IE9 standards and the only way I can get IE to render like the WebBrowser control is to set the Document Mode to IE5 quirks.  In which case it renders the same as the WebBrowser control even if Browser Mode is set to IE10.p  pIve set this registry value HKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMainFeatureControlFEATUREBROWSEREMULATIONWindowsFormsApplication2.exep  pIve tried setting it to 10000, 10001, 9999, 8888, 9000, and a few other values decimal, not hex and they have no effect on this issue.  My EXE name is WindowsFormsApplication2.exe, and Ive set my build to x64 and confirmed it is running as a 64bit process, so that I dont have to worry about setting Wow6432Node instead but I even tried setting that also.p  pSo Im thinking that only controls the Browser Mode, but not the Document Mode  I tried the obsolete FEATURENATIVEDOCUMENTMODE setting also, no change.p  pNote, I tagged this as TWebBrowser also because I originally found this issue using that, but since hardly anyone uses that I made sure I could recreate in a real simple .NET C WinForms app.p  hr  pstrongAdded May 17thstrongp  pHere is a reg export I deleted everything under HKCU just to make sure it wasnt overriding anything in HKLMp  pWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00p  precode[HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMainFeatureControlFEATUREBROWSEREMULATION] prevhost.exedword00001f40 HelpPane.exedword00002710 sllauncher.exedword00001f40 test.exedword00002710 iexplore.exedword00002711 windowsformsapplication2dword00002710 windowsformsapplication2.exedword00002710 testdword00002710 codepre  pHere is what my test.exe looks like in Task Managerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6qZSC.png altenter image description herep
Negative 5142 pI am using DHTMLX Scheduler, with the Timeline extension.p  pI have connected my data to a MySQL database and everything works fine. I then created custom code to where 2 colors background and text are set and inserted in to the database, under the sections the yaxis values table.p  pNow when the page with the scheduler is loaded, a SQL query is executed, which checks each event and copies the color values to the events table from the section table. Then further down in the page when the scheduler is initialized, it also collects and assigns these values to each event.p  pstrongemExampleemstrongp  pI have Room1 and Room2 as sections. I set Room1s background color to blue and save it to the DB. When the page loads, the query checks all events assigned to Room1, and assigns them the same background color of blue.p  pstrongemProblememstrongp  pWhen I add a new event, it is assigned the default background color.p  pWhen I move an event, it keeps its previous background color.p  pRefreshing the page, reruns the script and all the colors are updated accordingly. However this does not solve my problem as it has to be done manually. Is there a way to do this automatically that it refreshes the page after an insertupdatep  pOr even more ideally, I can store the sections colors in variables when the page loads, and then assign them accordingly on the clientside insertupdate events. And when the page is loaded, it will update the database. However, again, I am unsure of how to target these insertupdate functions.p  pAny help or suggestions, for a better solution is welcome and would be appreciated.p  pThank you in advancep

Some articles suggest adding the CLIEvent attribute to member somethinghappended above but it seems to make no difference as far as its usability from C without including the F library goes. p  pHow do I correctly define an event in F so I can then add a delegate to it in C code Many thanks.p

Negative 5142 pI ve created a site using Dreamweaver, and all my images have absolute position with  metrics. it expands proportionally on wider screens, but everytime I try to resize and shrink browser window it just becomes a mess with all the images fallen in one narrow window. How can I rebuild my design so it shrinks in a browser window in a way that when it is too small for an element, it just wouldnt fit. Do I have to use fixed posing or any other type of posing Whats the usual way web designers do the sites P.S. my site contains text and abs. images, as well as fixed image that scrolls with the screen. What should I use to keep it that way but make a decent view in all screen sizesp

Negative 5142 pNote Although this question is about store, the load case has the same issues and is perfectly symmetric.p  pThe SSE intrinsics provide an a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7ek6y8w1vvs.90.aspxcodemmstoreupdcodea function with the following signaturep  precodevoid mmstoreupd double p, m128d a codepre  pSo if I have vector of two doubles, and I want to store it to an array of two doubles, I can just use this intrinsic.p  pHowever, my vector is not two doubles it is two 64bit integers, and I want to store it to an array of two 64bit integers. That is, I want a function with the following signaturep  precodevoid mmstoreuepi64 int64t p, m128i a codepre  pBut the intrinsics provide no such function.

Writing to an object via the wrong type of pointer is a violation of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions98650strict aliasinga and is definitely undefined behavior.

Negative 5142 pIve seen technique treating a char array as a structclass and operate on it directly. See the following pseudo examplep  precodeStruct Container      char e1     short e2     int e3     Class4 e4     Class5 e5      more...   char msg  char[SOMESIZE]  Fill up the msg with some bit stream.   Then we treat the char array as struct.

Clearly the biggest question is when the Container has structclass objects like e4 and e5. Btw, I wanna use it in Linux.p  pAnd I wonder when would memory alignment come into play for this usagep  pWould appreciate it if theres a good article to refer to.p  pRe bens comment. The use case I saw was receiving messages from a socket, where the message format is well defined. Think the motive here is need for speed. With this technique, we dont need to copy any fields in order to populate them into structs, just use them directly. This saves some memory and CPU time.p  pI was thinking how we handle the alignment though.p

I dont want to use that oneem and am getting some strange behavior when trying to set the defaults for jquery.validate.p  pI wire it up like this ...p  h2jquery.validators.setup.jsh2  precode.validator.setDefaults    errorClass haserror,    validClass hassuccess,    highlight functionelement, errorClass, validClass       console.loghighlighting , element, errorClass, validClass    ,    unhighlight functionelement, errorClass, validClass       console.logunhighlighting, element, errorClass, validClass    ,    errorPlacement functionerror, element       console.logerror on , element, error      codepre  pObviously I will expand these behaviors more, but I need them to at least be triggering first. So my HTML looks like this. I am using codenovalidatecode to prevent HTML5 validation and only use jquery validate.p  h2index.htmlh2  precodeltform roleform novalidategt    ltdiv classformgroupgt       lth1gtNamelth1gt       ltinput typetext classformcontrol inputlg          placeholderName          required          minlength3          maxlength24          datangmodelModel.Name gt    ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pAnd by all accounts, I think this should work ... but it simply never fires off the validation events. I am trying to make sure they fire off on blur, and I am hoping to avoid needing to wire anything up in my angular controllers.p
Negative 5142 pIn Eclipse and Java, there is a debugging feature that allows you to drop back to any point in the current call stack.  So, pause the thread then choose any line in the call stack and say Drop to Frame.  That will position the debugger to start of the method call in that frame.  The state variables are reset so this in effect lets you go backwards.  Is there an equivalent feature in gdb  p

The user inserts data in the EditText, presses the Insert button and a new layout is created and added in the fragment.p  pWhat I want to achieve is say that I open the navigation drawer and select another page, the fragment gets replaced and if I go back to this fragment via navigation drawer or via Back button I want the text, that the user added, to be still there.p  pI do not call codePenaltiesFragment.newInstancecode everytime I switch back to this fragment, I instead create the codePenaltiesFragmentcode object once and keep using that one.

But how do I get the inserted codeCustomPenaltyLayoutcode back I cannot create it in the codeonCreateViewcode method.p

What is best way   The largest number from NumerOfSheets should be as small as possible. Suppose that this example FormsfrmGlownyFreeBlocks  1 so its very simple example.

Its very simple example because I have only ABC oders and 1 block to allocate. But When I will have e.g orders ABCDEFGH and 14 blocks to allocate count by hand will be terrible Please guys, help me. Any solution what I found on the Internet, is about defined number of rows orders in my case  before running code I always know OrderQuantityBlockbefore add additional blocks.  p

Negative 5142 pI set out to see if I can configure my development environment such that I can run codeadbcode commands from my dev box in the office network on an Android device that is connected to the USB port of my laptop which is in the same LAN or connected via VPN. I specifically wanted the adb server to be running on the dev box and communicating to the adb daemon on my device over the network. I didnt want to connect the adb client that runs on the dev box to the adb server running on my laptop which the adb tool allows via its codeHcode option and I didnt want to use the codeadb connectcode or codeadb tcpipcode commands. Basically, I just wanted to relay the adb communication that happens over the USB cable to happen over the network SSH tunnel.p  pAs a proof of concept, I managed to build a prototype using a a hrefhttpwww.eltima.comproductsusboverethernet relnofollowthird party solutiona that would allow me to share USB over network but now I want to see if I can build the same solution using port forwarding and some coding. However, my technical knowledge of USB drivers, OS kernels, and how the USB communication works on Linux and Mac is very basic so I am hoping to find some answers from the community.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Where in the USB stack do I need to start creating hooks so I can forward all data communication of a certain USB port to a different process running in the same OSp  pstrongProposalstrong If I can find the port numbers that the USB drivers on each machine communicate to the process in the kernels that then forwards the data to the application, I can use port forwarding on each machine to reroute the communication to a daemon process running on each machine that then wraps the data in TCPIP and transfers over the network. The image below depicts this scenariop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1Ixiu.png altenter image description herep  pThe adb server that runs on the client machine will need to be configured to route its communication to a port on the client machine that an damon emulator process listens. This daemon process will then have to transmit the data over the network to another daemon process running on the server machine that hosts the Android device via a USB port. The latter daemon process listening to the same port that the client machine send out TCPIP data will then read the data, transforms it to adb protocol, and sends the data to the USB device. The parts of this solution that I am trying to learn more about is how to write a daemon process that acts as a USB device emulator. Any help or recommendations for further reading is appreciated.p

Negative 5142 pWhats the recommended way to import dependencies for a C project in Eclipsep  pFor example, say Im making a library and the project looks likep  precodeMyLib  MyLib.cpp codepre  pNow I want to add the Lua library which I guess could just be under my project. But the problem is it needs its own build formula which it includes as a makefilep  precodeMyLib  MyLib.cpp  Lua  lua.h  lua.c  Makefile  lua.a codepre  pOr I can import Lua into a new project and have my library reference it in several ways to find the header, the library and so onp  precodeMyLib  MyLib.cpp Lua  lua.h  lua.c  Makefile  lua.a codepre  pThe problem here is it takes a lot of fiddling with the build setups and after I get it right Id like to be able to export everything someone needs to build my library so someone else can work on it. Or even just so I can work on it on another system.p  pIve seen a similar question about organizing Java projects and in that case they say to make a super project with other projects under it. But this advice assumes youre using Maven and I think the answer may be different for a C project. What is your advicep

Negative 5142 pI am tracking a moving vehicle with a stereo camera system. In both images I use background segmentation to get only the moving parts in the pictures, then put a rectangle around the biggest object.p  pNow I want to get the 3D coordinates of the center of the rectangle. The identified centers in the two 2D pictures are almost correlating points I know not exactly. I did a stereo calibration with MATLAB, so I have the intrinsic parameters of both cameras and the extrinsic parameters of the stereo system.p  pOpenCV doesnt provide any function for doing this as far as I know and to be honest reading Zisserman didnt really help me, but maybe I am just blind to the obvious.p

Negative 5142 pWhat I want to do is process AMQP messages in a very similar way the Http Requests are processed using emspringwebmvcem annotations such as emRequestMappingem, emRequestParamem etc. But, instead of the Http Request my source object will be an AMQP message. The AMQP message request will have two headers, for example p  precodemethodPOST urlapimyobjectssomeParam codepre  pand the payload will contain data in json format.p  pIf you have noticed, this is nothing but HTTP REST api mapped to AMQP message.

They are close to what I want, but would not allow routing to handler methods based on header parameters, especially the REST url.p  pI dont expect that a readymade solution would be available for this. Just want to make sure I choose the best possible option.

Negative 5142 pIm currently developing a Java 2D game engine for a university project and so far its going pretty good. One issue however that Ive stumbled across is that Im not sure how to handle collisions from different angles. As of right now I have a Sprite class that extends JComponent and the way I check for collisions is simply to check if the spritearea of 2 sprites interects using the intersects method from Rectangle. I also have the option to add hitboxes internal rectangles to the sprites and if a sprite has a hitbox the collisions detection checks if any of the inner rectangles collides after seeing that the spritearea collides.p  pThis works great for determining whether 2 sprites collides or not but the issue is that you need to know from which angle they collide. As of right now Ive done so that if you collide with a solid object your Yvelocity is set to 0 and  the yposition is set to the previous frame, but as you might imagine this only works for horizontal plane. If I add a box or something and walk into that box from the side my characther doesnt stop since it thinks that it has landed on top of the box. Is there any good ways of determining from which direction a collision has occured without completely redoing my whole structure I think using hitboxes as rectangles was so elegant and effective which is why I rather not rewrite everything unless necessary. p

Negative 5142 pI am thinking to use Microsoft sync framework, but one of the problems is that the databaseSql Server 2005 has the triggers disabled and there is a process that disable triggers if there is one. So I can not use triggers. And I CAN NOT put extra code on the application which is inserting, deleting and updating the table.p  pSo the problem is that MSF create triggerswhen it is provisioning for tracking transaction. but in my case those triggers are going to be useless.p  pCould anybody tell me if there is any way to use Microsoft Sync Framework without triggers or anyway to replace them with something similar.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5142 pIm an iOS dev, with absolutely no experience with android, so forgive me if I have difficulty expressing my questionp  pIm getting a Fatal Exception in an android app Im tasked with maintaining.p  precodeFatal Exception java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to start activity ComponentInfo java.lang.NullPointerException codepre  pI can see from the crash report attached below that the crash is happening in one of my fragments in a method called bindLocationp  pHere is the line its crashing onp  precode            mLocationHeaderTextView.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE codepre  pSo clearly the problem is that mLocationHeaderTextview is null. mLocationHeaderTextView is injected using roboguice as followsp  precode InjectViewR.id.filterlocationheader TextView mLocationHeaderTextView codepre  pNow, I think the error is caused by my textView not being injected. After looking at the stack trace, Ive determine that this is likely a result of onViewCreated not getting called before bindLocation is called.p  pThis is where Im getting lost, however. Im very unfamiliar with android, so Im not sure how its possible that my onViewCreated method is getting skipped over. Ive tried a million things on the device to try and reproduce this situation, but I am unable. No matter what user actions I can think to try, my onViewCreated method gets called and my variable is nonNull. Perhaps Im misreading the stack trace. Im hoping that my stack trace below provides enough information for yall to help me, but if not, let me know what else I can tell you about the app. I cannot post my full source code as it does not belong to me, but I will provide whatever information I can.p  pThanks so much for your helpp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMzkY3.png altenter image description herep  pFrom my FilterDrawerFragmentp  precode Override public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState      View view  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentfilterdrawer, container, false      ButterKnife.injectthis, view      return view   Override public void onViewCreatedView view, Bundle savedInstanceState      super.onViewCreatedview, savedInstanceState      mRulesHeaderReset.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView view              resetRules                    if getActivity  null ampamp mDrawerLayout  null          mDrawerLayout  DrawerLayout getActivity.findViewByIdR.id.filterdrawerlayout          if mDrawerLayout  null              mDrawerLayout.setDrawerListenernew DrawerLayout.DrawerListener                  Override                 public void onDrawerSlideView view, float v                                     Override                 public void onDrawerOpenedView view                      NavigationUtils.invalidateOptionsMenugetActivity                                   Override                 public void onDrawerClosedView view                      notifyFiltersChanged                      NavigationUtils.invalidateOptionsMenugetActivity                                   Override                 public void onDrawerStateChangedint i                                               set a custom shadow that overlays the main content when the drawer opens             mDrawerLayout.setDrawerShadowR.drawable.drawershadow, GravityCompat.END                    mlocationChangeButton.setOnClickListenerthis      bindUI    private void bindUI      if isAdded ampamp mConfiguration  null            bind the location         bindLocation                 private void bindLocation      if isAdded ampamp mConfiguration  null ampamp mConfiguration.isLocationEnabled            show the location related items         mLocationHeaderTextView.setVisibilityView.VISIBLECrash reported here.

XCode offers this feature to design UIs and workflows in an interface builder called Storyboards.  Every Storyboard has a scene, and from videos of XCode 5, it appears you can drag these scenes around to organize them along with the segues.  For my IDE instance, I can dragndrop scenes from the Object Library into the editor, but once there, I can no longer adjust or move them around.  The scenes appear pinned to the editor.  This results in scenes overlapping one another.  Basically, I have a ball of scenes in the middle of my editor currently.  p  pstrongResearch Backgroundstrong I have spent the better part of the day exploring XCode for ways to enable adjustments andor googling.  Googling this issue has not helped as XCode documentation seems to assume this is intuitive and works outofthebox which is how it should be IMO.

Although many people write codeconst char code, its considered best practice by some, to write codechar const code because then application of the const is consistent.p  pYou cant cast away a const without receiving a warning from the C compiler. memcpy is the only way to work around this without warnings.p  pMany older libraries dont correctly mark arguments to their functions as const, and if you have applied const correctly to types in your code, the compiler will emit warnings. That is why using memcpy is occasionally acceptable.p

Negative 5142 pI have a Web application that I usually deployed using Web Deploy directly from Visual Studio whatever branch I am currently using in VS  normally emmasterem. But now Im introducing a second web app on Azure that will be built from the strongsame repo but different branchstrong. To make things simpler I will be configuring both Web apps on Azure to integrate directly with GitHub and associate them with specific branch.p  pI also added two additional codeweb.configcode files codeWeb.Primary.configcode and codeWeb.Secondary.configcode and configured app settings on Azure portal of each web app by adding additional value codeSCMBUILDARGScode and set them top  precodeSCMBUILDARGSpPublishProfilePrimary  in primary web app SCMBUILDARGSpPublishProfileSecondary  in secondary web app codepre  pwhich I understand strongwill transform correct config filestrong with specific external services configurations DB connection, mail server, etc..p  pNow the additional step that I would like to include in continuous deployment is run a set of SQL scripts that I have in my repo that I used to manually upgrade database during Web Deploy in VS. Individual scripts are actually doing specific database upgrade stepsp  ol libackup current tables  backup creates a set of BackupOriginalTableName tables that are copied from existing ones and populated with existing datali lidrop whole DB model  all nonbackup objects are being dropped from procedures, functions, types, views, tables...li licreate model  creates all tables, views and indicesli licreate user typesli licreate user functionsli licreate stored proceduresli lirestore data to new tables from backup tables  this step may occasionally break if we introduce new nonnullable columns to tables in the new model dont have defaults defined on them I will somehow have to mitigate this problem by adding an additional script that will add missing columns to backup tables and give them some defaults, but thats a completely different issue.li ol  pI used to also have a set of batch files BAT in my VS solution that simply executed codesqlcmdcode against specific database instance and executed these scripts in predefined order as above. Hence I had batchesp  ul licodeRecreate Local.batcode  this one used additional SQL scripts to not restore from backup but rather to recreate an empty DB with only lookup tables being populated and some default data for development purposes like predefined test usersli licodeRestore Local.batcode  I used this script to simply restore database from backup tables discarding any invalid data I may have created while debuggingtesting since last DB recreateupgraderestoreli licodeUpgrade Local.batcode  upgrade local development DB executing scripts mentioned aboveli licodeUpgrade Production.batcode  upgrade production DB on Azure executing scripts mentioned aboveli ul  pSo to support the whole deployment process I was now doing manually in VS I would now like to also execute these scripts against specific Azure SQL DB during continuous deployment. I suppose I should be running these right after code deployment because if that one fails, DB shouldnt be upgraded either.p  pIm a bit confused where and how to do this Can I configure this somewhere in Azure portal I was looking for resources on the Web but I cant seem to find any relevant information how to do additional deployment steps to execute these scripts. I think this is some everyday scenario as its hard to think of web apps not requiring databases these days.p  pMaybe its just my process that is wrong for DB upgradedeployment so let me also know if there is any other emnormalem way that does DB upgrademigration with continuous deployment on Azure... I may change my process to accommodate for this.p  blockquote   pstrongemNote 1strong Im not using Entity Framework or any other full blown ORM. Im rather using NPoco and all my DB logic is built in SPs that DAL is using.emp      pstrongemNote 2strong Im aware of recently introduced staging capabilities of Azure, but my apps are on cheaper plan that doesnt support staging and I want to keep it this way as I may be introducing additional web apps along the way that will be using additional code branches and resources DB, mail etc.emp blockquote

Negative 5142 pIve been stuck at this line of code in my macro for a week now and read and tried numerous methods at solving this. p  pI must declare that Im not very good with VBA so bear with me and Id appreciate a token explanation of some of the steps.                     p  pWhat I want to do is rather simple actually, I have a large database of about 1000 rows in a table which I would like to do a match for two columns with duplicates for the same row number as efficiently as possible, for examplep  pColumn 1  James, John, John, James, Jebp  pcolumn 2  Smith, Lee, Smith, Wills, Blackp  pI would like to find the row with John amp Smith and the simple answer would be row 3.p  pBut the added complication is that the match target is a variable, for e.g.p  precodedim name1 as string dim name2 as string dim r as long name1  John name2  Smith r  application.worksheetfunction.matchname1ampname2,.rangeAAamp.rangeBB,0 codepre  pWhere this function has to be repeated through many iterations in the macro.p  pIve tried for instance using the for i1 to 1000 and individually matching for both columns through if arguments, but as far as I understand I couldnt get the row number out of the loop, ie r  result.row becomes empty outside the loop.p  pThank you very much for reading through this This forum has contributed so much to my existing code and Im incredibly grateful to the help so far.p

Negative 5142 pIm loading in the content of a modal with ajax. I have a button that submits the modal form and is suppose to close the modal when its done processing the ajax submit so it can update a table at the bottom of the page. Its not closing the modal after I update the table and call codemodalcontainer.modalhidecodep  pThis modal contains a table that has pagination on it. In the loaded.bs.modal event I turn all the links that have the codemodalpaginationlinkcode class into an ajax link. The pagination library Im using only allows the url and parameters of the link to be passed in which is why I do this link transformation after theyre loaded. When you click on one of these links it updates the table. In order to prevent the modal itself from closing after you click the link I call codethis.removeDatabs.modalcode. What Ive found is this codethis.removeDatabs.modalcode is what is preventing any of the codemodalcontainer.modalhidecodes from working.p  pHow do I prevent the modal from closing when a link is clicked on in the modal and still allow code.modalhidecode to still work What can I call instead of codethis.removeDatabs.modalcodep  precodefunction    Initialize modal dialog  attach modalcontainer bootstrap attributes to links with .modallink class.  when a link is clicked with these attributes, bootstrap will display the href content in a modal dialog. body.onclick, .modallink, function e      e.preventDefault     this.attrdatatarget, modalcontainer     this.attrdatatoggle, modal     modalcontainer.draggable     var updateTarget  this.attrdataajaxupdate     modalupdatetarget.attrvalue, updateTarget   Attach listener to .modalclosebtns so that when the button is pressed the modal dialog disappears body.onclick, .modalclosebtn, function       modalcontainer.modalhide  clear modal cache, so that new content can be loaded body.onhidden.bs.modal, .modal, function       this.removeDatabs.modal     modalupdatetarget.removeAttrvalue   modalcontainer.onclick, .modalpaginationlink, function e      var updateTarget  this.attrdataajaxupdate     modalupdatetarget.attrvalue, updateTarget   modalcontainer.onloaded.bs.modal, function       this.removeDatabs.modal     modalupdatetarget.removeAttrvalue     var pagcontainers  this.findmodalpagination     var hrefs  pagcontainers.finda.addClassmodalpaginationlink                                             .attrdataajax, true                                             .attrdataajaxmode, replace                                             .attrdatatoggle, modal                                             .attrdatatarget, modalcontainer                                                 modalcontainer.onsubmit, assetmodalfrm, function e      e.preventDefault     if confirmAre you sure          var data  this.serializeArray         .ajax             url licensesallocate,             type POST,             data data,              success function data                  for var i  0 i lt data.length  i                      allocatedLicenses trlast.after                     lttrgt.appendlttdgt.textdata[i].name                                     .appendlttdgt.textdata[i].manufacturerItem.serialNumber                                  modalcontainer.modalhide                              codepre  pmy htmlp  precode    ltdiv idmodalcontainer classmodal fade tabindex1 roledialoggt         ltinput idmodalupdatetarget typehiddengt         ltdiv classmodaldialoggt             ltdiv classmodalcontent centerblock styledisplay tablegt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre

Negative 5142 pI am using SQL Server 2008.  I am using the following technique to identify all rows in one table codetableAcode that are not in another table codetableBcodep  precodeSELECT tableA.key FROM tableA LEFT JOIN tableB ON tableA.key  tableB.key WHERE tableB.key IS NULL codepre  pI am actually identifying all rows in codetableAcode that arent in other tables, listed by different keys. For example,p  precodeSELECT col1col2col3 AS ColumnsinQuestion, CASE WHEN tableB.colx IS NULL THEN col1 value not found ELSE  END    CASE WHEN tableC.colphi IS NULL THEN col2 value not found ELSE  END    CASE WHEN tableD.cola IS NULL THEN col3 value not found ELSE  END AS ErrorMessages, CASE WHEN tableB.colx IS NULL THEN tableA.col1 ELSE  END    CASE WHEN tableC.colphi IS NULL THEN tableA.col2 ELSE  END    CASE WHEN tableD.cola IS NULL THEN tableA.col3 ELSE  END AS OffendingValues FROM tableA LEFT JOIN tableB ON tableA.col1  tableB.colx LEFT JOIN tableC ON tableA.col2  tableC.colphi LEFT JOIN tableD ON tableA.col3  tableD.cola WHERE tableB.colx IS NULL OR tableC.colphi IS NULL OR tableD.cola IS NULL codepre  pMy issue is that I need to screen out codeNULLcode in the columns of codetableAcode.  For example, suppose codetableA.col1code is codenullcode for a handful of rows.  These handful of rows will return because of the codeLEFT JOINcode.  But, because theyre codeNULLcode, then they didnt really fail in the lookup against codetableBcode.  So, I dont want them to return.  Normally, in the codeWHEREcode clause, I would just put something likep  precodetableA.col1 IS NOT NULL AND tableB.colx IS NULL codepre  pIn my actual situation, is it equivalent to just put this in a for each test  For example, does the following achieve thisp  precodeWHERE tableB.colx IS NULL AND tableA.col1 IS NOT NULL OR tableC.colphi IS NULL AND tableA.col2 IS NOT NULL OR tableD.cola IS NULL AND tableA.col3 IS NOT NULL codepre  pMy concern is that I dont want to limit codetableAcode to only those rows where all 3 columns are populated.  After all, even with just one of the columns populated, I need to still perform the test.p  pOr, is this a good way to screen out codeNULLscode at allp

Negative 5142 pI know this question has probably been asked before I just cant manage to get mine going. I set up my SQL to have two tables but in this instance I will only be using one called Book.

Negative 5142 pIm working on a game in XcodeSwift for iPadiPhone. p  pWhat I need to do is to get the outline path of an imagesilhouette, so that I can animate along the outline of the imagesilhouette. This to create a laser cutting like effect, the one you see in movies when they break through a doorwindow with a lasercutter. p  pJust drawing it as a Beizer path wont work since I need to do this for a bunch of imagessilhouettes. If possible I would prefer just to add images to my project and do the outlining in code, that way I can easily expand with more shapes and sizes. p  pIn SpriteKit Ive tried to use a SKPhysicsBody and then use the Alpha to create the outline. This gives me that outline but not as a path, so I cant animate along that line.

Negative 5142 pwe are on 7.1 EE and Ive been tasked with designing a SOAPWSDL web service running on Mule that could be consumed by the external clients. The WSDL is given as an input. p  pThe MuleSofts recommended way is to use CXF component for the purpose, generate java classes with wsdl2java and then add the WS logic to the java code.  This of course works but its more a java way of doing the task rather than Mule ESB way.p  pI would prefer an approach where strongMule flow and message transforming components implement the WS logic rather than the java classesstrong. p  pActually, the APIKit is already working this way. Unfortunately, it doesnt support WSDL.  So, what Im looking for is the followingp  ol liGetting the WS input as a POJO in the payload after the schema been validated by CXF. li liUse  DataMapper to transform the POJO to lets say some external VM input parametersli liGet the response from VM into DataMapper, put the values into the WS Response POJO. li liLetting the CXF to complete the task of returning the response to the caller.li ol  pThis would be more Mule way of doing the task, IMHO. p  pNow, looking at the java code generated there are request and response POJOs  already there and could be used in DataMapper. p  pI suspect that there could be actually a way of getting the WS request POJO in the Mule payload, transform it, populate the result POJO and somehow return it back to CXF.p  pAny ideas of how this could be implemented  p  pPls note that I dont think that using CXF proxy mode is a good alternative. Because with this approach you effectively loosing a knowledge about the requestresponse format.  And then youll have to manually define the payload fields for the mapping... Effectively, this would be a manual SOAP parsing.p
