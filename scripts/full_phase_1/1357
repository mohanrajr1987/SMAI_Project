And later when the lib checks if the double is infinite by Double.isInfinite, it throws the JSONException since obviously 123456789e1234 is greater than Doubles standard of finite.p  pHow do I force it not to parse the value as number at all Is there any java library out there that correctly converts XML to JSON in this casep

The purpose of the intended code generator is to generate one or more classes, so that they could be embedded in a C project.p  pRegarding the specification of the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized, it could be defined as in the following examplep  precodesimple type Message int id, string content codepre  pGiven the specification in the above example, the intended code generator could generate the following C classp  precodepublic class Message      public int Id  get set       public string Content  get set       public byte[] Serialize               ...           public void Deserializebyte[] data               ...       codepre  pI read about a hrefhttpwww.antlr.org relnofollowANTLRa and I believe that this tool is perfect for the just explained purpose. As explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1932664this answera, I should first create a grammar for the specification of the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized.p  pThe above example is very simple, because it defines only a simple type, but the specification of the structure of data could be more complex, so we could have a emcompound typeem which includes one or more simple types, or lists, etc., like in the following examplep  precodesimple type LogInfo DateTime time, String message simple type LogSource String class, String version compound type LogEntry LogInfo info, LogSource source codepre  pMoreover, the specification of the data could include also one or more constraints, like in the following examplep  precodesimple type Message int id constraint not negative, string content codepre  pIn this case, the intended code generator could generate the following C classp  precodepublic class Message      private int id     private string content      public int Id              get  return id          set                      if value lt 0                 throw new ArgumentException...              id  value                    public string Content              get  return content          set  content  value            public byte[] Serialize               ...           public void Deserializebyte[] data               ...       codepre  pEssentially, the intended code generator should find all userdefined types, any constraints, etc .. Is there some simple examplep

Negative 1357 pI have a window which overrides a codeRadioButtoncodes codeControlTemplatecode to show a custom control inside of it. Inside the custom control, I have a buttons visibility tied to codeIsMouseOvercode, which works correctly in showing the button only when the mouse is hovering over the control.

After some debugging and reading, it seems that the codeRadioButtoncode is capturing the mouse on click, and this makes codeIsMouseOvercode for the codeUserControlcode false.p  pI tried binding the codeButtoncodes visibility to codeFindAncestor xType RadioButtoncode and it works, but it seems a bit fragile to me to have the codeUserControlcode depend on who is containing it.

Negative 1357 pI recently asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions468704maildirheadersproblem468821this questiona and worked out that the reason a single email message is displaying out of order is not in fact because of the date, but because of the order of the messages. I would like to modify my script to make sure all messages are in the correct order, but am unsure how to do this. Is it just based on the order in which the files appear, or is there a special part of the maildir headers which specify thisp  pHere is an example of what I mean a hrefhttpimg19.picoodle.comimgimg193123fmailsmc4ee3b6.jpg relnofollowExampleap  pIn general, every MUA I use, including Thunderbird, Evolution and mail2web.com can order by date, but will be default order by the message number. I am on a shared host which I believe uses qmail. The message number tag information must be kept somewhere.p  pedit I tried moving all files to a temp directory and back again, which has shown that it is the file order which is responsible for the message number. I am however unsure as to why the messages from a few days in December have been moved to a much lower number than the numbers of messages on either side of those date. The filenames are timestamps and should be sequential, so unless mv movied the files in a strange order, I do not understand why the message numbers would not be restored for these particular files.p

Negative 1357 pIve got a couple of really old MSDos based paint programs. They work on palette indexed image buffers.

Negative 1357 pI am interested in help selecting one of the common symmetric encryption algorithms Twofish, AES, etc based on performance criteria fastest encryptiondecryption.  We are currently leaning toward AES, but since the communications we are sending back and forth dont really need that level of encryption, a less secure algorithm would be acceptable for a performance gain.p  pWe will be using the selected algorithm to encryptdecrypt messages should be no longer than 200 characters that are being sent between the client and server Javascript client and PHP on the server strikeover HTTPSstrike.  The speed of the algorithm is important because the encryptiondecryption process will need to keep up with messages as they arrivedepart via sockets on the server.p  pI have found one a hrefhttpwww.cryptopp.combenchmarks.html relnofollowsitea that has benchmarks for encryption and I plan to do my own testing, but I was hoping for input from SO on selecting an encryption for speed.

Negative 1357 pOk heres what Im trying to accomplish. Say I have 100 items. I want to create a grideach Item consisting of an x, y point. I want the grid to be as close to a square as possible. Is there any kind of math to determine the grid width, and grid height id need by just a single numberBy grid width and height I mean the number of x items, and the number of Y itemsp  pNow that I think about it would it be efficient to take the square root of the number, say varIsqrt45, remove the decimal place from varI...XvarI...then Y would be varI1p

Negative 1357 pIm using D3DXSaveSurfaceToFile to save windowed Direct3D 9 surfaces to PNG, BMP and JPG files.  There are no errors returned from the D3DXSaveSurfaceToFile call and all files open fine in Windows Photo Viewer and Paint.  But they will not open in a higher end image editing program such as Paint Shop Pro or Photoshop.  The error messages from these programs basically say that the file is corrupted.  If I open the files in Paint and then save them in the same file format with a different file name, then theyll open fine in the other programs.  p  pThis leads me to believe that D3DXSaveSurfaceToFile is writing out nonstandard versions of these file formats.  Is there some way I can get this function to write out files that can be opened in programs like Photoshop without the intermediate step of resaving the files in Paint  Or is there another function I should be using that does a better job of saving a Direct3D surfaces to an imagep

Negative 1357 pCan anyone help me achieve picking using the Tao framework or OpenTK p
Negative 1357 pIve got a table where the accessoryView button in the cell is replaced by a custom check mark icon. If the time interval for a pair of temperature settings is enabled, the cell row shows a check mark, along with a time, heating and cooling value. If the time is disabled, no check mark, and time displayed in the timefield.text is modified to state Disabled. The code works fine when I use codereloadDatacode. However, since Im updated only one row at a time, thats overkill for the big table that Im using. Im trying to use codereloadRowsAtIndexPathscode but I get screen updates that affect  not only the cell that was clicked on, but the previous cell that was clicked on. I was using no animations codeUITableViewRowAnimationNonecode, but changed that to fading animations codeUITableViewRowAnimationFadecode to see what was going on. Sure enough, the fading occurs on the desired table row and the undesired table row. Also, the time value for the current cell row appears in the previous cell row time field. Once I stay with clicking on one row, theres no problem with the updates, but once I switch to another row, I have both rows affected the one time. Its like the update method is picking up cruft from somewhere.p  pI have also tried bracketing the codereloadRowsAtIndexPathscode call with calls to codebeginUpdatescode and codeendUpdatescode, and nothing changes.p  pClearly Im not understanding something fundamental here.

work fine at first glance, but if you make the screen small enough to where you have to scroll, the background color doesnt fill the entire scroller, only the part that is initially shown before you start scrolling, so you get something that looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCDHP7.png altBackground does not scrollp  pIm not sure what the best way for me to fix this problem is, but I figure I could resize the background color Rect to match the scroller width...if I could find out what the scroller width is. And by scroller width, I mean the width of the content it contains, not the width of its viewport hope my terminology is correct. Is there a way to find that width, or is there a better way of doing this The width of each panel is set, but the size of the window may extend beyond the width of the content, so I want to make sure the background fills the users window excluding the title bar, of course, no matter what size their window is.

Negative 1357 pI have an orchestration which exposes a web service, it examines the source of the message received executes some branching logic based on that and calls one of a set of service orchestrations which resides in a different Application. These  service orchestrations perform some update on my message then send it back to the routing orchestration when complete. The routing application then sends an appropriate web service response. i.e the end to end process is all meant to be synchronous.p  pMy intention was to have a direct bound sendreceive port on my routing orchestration and a linked receivesend port on the service orchestrations to achieve the blocking, but Im having trouble making this work.p  pIve tried using correlations and filter expressions but Im consistently seeing the Multiple Subscribers error when the Service orchestration tries to send back its response. p  pIve ensured that no other orchestrationsports are using my Schema to the point of creating a brand new one to be sure.p  pTearing my hair out over this a bit, It seems like something which should be relatively straightforward to accomplish.p  pp.s Im leaning towards having the service orchestrations expose a web service and calling that, but it seems like a long way around for something which is always going to reside on the same machine.p

What that app does is call on a php file in my web host and triggers the php codep  pWhat I need help with here is how can I keep record in php of the calendar of the week for my computer. What I mean by that is if someone like an admin has a specific code that I have written for them, and that code runs automatically all week, but a specific week they dont want that code to run, instead they want a different code to run that week. How can I use php to find when a week has ended or keep track of the week using that calendar in bottom right of your computer screen so that my program will know after an admin wants a different code run from the usual code that the week is over no need to run that admin irregular code any more go back to your usual automated running code.p  pIf you still dont know what I am talking. I will try to explain more. Think of 2 separate codes. One Custom and the other automated. The automated runs all the time automatically. But one day the admin chooses for that week he doesnt want to follow the regular shcedule of running the automated code as usual, instead for that week he would like to run the custom code and after the week is over go back to running the automated code as usual.p  pI hope that makes it more clear. I know that in PHP  gives the date. But I really need expert opinion on how to do this.p

With some logging I can see that it starts the hook on the correct process and hooks Direct3DCreate9 correctly.p  pNext TMyDirect3D9 is created successfully. But the process crashes from here. p  pMy educated guess based on some debugging in Ollydbg that when I return MyDirect3D9 back to the original process via the hooked Direct3DCreate9 and it tries to call one of the classinterface functions it fails.p  pCode follows.

interfaces seem to act differently than a real one Delphi has an in between for it to successfully talk to other interfaces. So I just converted the interface to an array of pointers. p  pNow the program successfully calls CreateDevice. I can see this both in the logs and stepping through in Ollydbg.p  pNow what happens is that when CreateDevice calls the original IDirect3D9.CreateDevice it crashes again. When I debug in Ollydbg I notice that it is dereferencing the pointer once too much. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Ok, fixed some pointer issues with PIDirect3D9 vs IDirect3D9 in different places. So the original IDirect3D9.CreateDevice gets called. But it errors with D3DERRINVALIDCALLp  pSo confusing.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong Ok, with some more debugging it seems that when I call the function an extra parameter gets pushed on the stack. Which makes the first param invalid. This is proved further by DirectX Debugging which says iAdapter parameter invalid first param.p  pstrongUPDATE 4strong With using IntRefToMethPtr to get the direct pointer to the original CreateDevice call I was able to get it to call with the stacks the same. Same result. Its looking like Ive went the wrong route with trying to hook it in Delphi. p  pstrongUPDATE 5strong Rewrote the hooking method. Now Im just hooking essentially EndScene. Hook now works fine in a test program Vertices.exe that came with the hook demo found in the first URL in this post. But in the main game it crashes the game. Either way Ive learned a lot.p

Whereas GHC has gone the whole hog and let you do it up to arbitrary limits.p  pSo, would it be possible to define this family of operatorsfunctions from within the haskell implementation itself, using nothing but the type system and existing language features declarations, type signatures, function definitions etc. And if so, how Or is it impossible and you have to instead look into the compiler to find the supporting framework for this collection of functionsp  pThis leads to an even more general question How much of Haskell is supported by Haskell itself, through type and function definitions, declarations etc and how much is supported by the compilerimplementation I am aware that GHC was written in Haskell, that doesnt answer the questionp  pThat is, if you were to abandon the standard libraries including the prelude and do everything from the ground up in raw Haskell would it be possible to build a complete implementation that has all the features of GHC, using only that minimal set of features What are the mimimum set of language features that you need in order to build a haskell implementation using Haskell Would I be able to abandon the prelude and then strongcompletelystrong rebuild it strongmanuallystrong from within GHC If you abandon the prelude and never import anything, what is left over for you to work with p  pIt may seem like Im asking a million questions, but theyre really all trying to ask the same thing with different wording.

Negative 1357 pI work on a project where the design is to have a database per customer. I have managed to read in Tomcat documentation and establish a connection pool.

Negative 1357 pIve been reading code and documentation to try to understand how class reloading works in clojure. According to many websites, such as a hrefhttptutorials.jenkov.comjavareflectiondynamicclassloadingreloading.htmlhttptutorials.jenkov.comjavareflectiondynamicclassloadingreloading.htmla , whenever you load a class essentially you obtain the bytecode via any data mechanism, convert the bytecode into an instance of class Class via defineClass, and then resolve link the class via resolveClass. Does defineClass implicitly call resolveClass. Any given classloader is only allowed to link a class once. If it attempts to link an existing class, it does nothing. This creates a problem since you cannot link a newly instantiated class, therefore you have to create a new instance of a classloader everytime you reload a class.p  pGoing back to clojure, I tried examining the paths to load classes.p  pIn clojure, you can define new classes in multiple ways depending on what you wantp  pAnonymous Class reify proxyp  pNamed Class deftype defrecord which uses deftype under the hood genclassp  pUltimately, those codes point to clojuresrcjvmclojurelangDynamicClassLoader.java p  pwhere DynamicClassLoaderdefineClass creates an instance with supers defineClass and then caches the instance. When you want to retrieve the class, clojure load with a call to forName which calls the classloader and DynamicClassLoaderfindClass, which first looks in the cache before delegating to the super class which is contrary to the way most normal classloaders work, where they delegate first, than try it themselves. strongThe important point of confusion is the following forName is documented to link the class before it returns but this would imply you can not reload a class from the existing DynamicClassLoader and instead need to create a new DynamicClassLoader, however I dont see this in the code.strong I understand that proxy and reify define anonymous classes, so their names are different thus can be treated as if its a different class. However, for the named classes, this breaks down. In real clojure code, you can have references to the old version of the classes and references to the new version of the classes simultaneously, but attempts to create new class instances will be of the new version.p  pPlease explain how clojure is able to reload classes without creating new instances of DynamicClassLoader, if I can understand the mechanism to reload classes, I would like to extend this reloading functionality to javas .class files I may create using javac.p  pNotes This question refers to class RELOADING, not simply dynamic loading. Reloading means that I have already interned a class but want to intern a new updated version of that instance.p  pI want to reiterate, that its not clear how clojure is able to reload deftype defined classes. Calling deftype eventually leads to a call to clojure.lang.DynamicClassLoaderdefineClass. Doing this again leads another call to defineClass, but doing this manually results in a Linkage Error. What is happening underneath here that allows clojure to do this with deftypesp

Negative 1357 pIve managed to get an android.graphics.Bitmap created and Im successfully filling it via the SetPixels command.p  pThe problem is that I start off with RGBA data.  I then create a jintArray.  I then call SetIntArray effectively memcpying the data into the buffer.  Then, finally, I call setPixels to actually set the pixels which presumably causes another copy.p  pone big issue with doing this is that whether I used R8G8B8A8 or R5G6B5 or A8 I still have to convert my pixel data to R8G8B8A8 data. p  pIdeally Id like a way to fill the buffer using only one copy and allow me to do it without doing the pixel format conversion.p  pIs there any way to directly get at the buffer data contained in a Bitmap I see there is a function GetDirectBufferAddress in the JNI, but the documentation I can find on it suggests its limited to a java.nio.buffer.  Can I directly get at the pixel data using this function Perhaps by getting the internal buffer used by the Bitmap class  p  pIs my only way of using this to create a Global Refd Java.nio.buffer then each time I want to update, copy my pixel data into it and then use copyPixelsFromBuffer  This still involves 2 copies but can, at least, eliminate the pixel format change.  Is this going to be any more efficient than the method Im already using   p  pIs there an even better way of doing itp  pBtw, I emAMem aware of the fact I can use the functions in lt androidbitmap.h  but I would really like to not lose support for Android 2.1 and Android 2.2 ...p  pCheers in advancep
Negative 1357 pI recently asked a question here on Stack Overflow about how to cast my data from a 16bit integer followed by an undetermined amount of voidcast memory into an stdvector of unsigned chars for the sake of using a socket library known as NetLink which uses a function whose signature looks like this to send raw datap  precodevoid rawSendconst vectorltunsigned chargt data codepre  pfor reference, heres that question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7683044castinganunsignedintastringtoanunsignedcharvectorCasting an unsigned int  a string to an unsigned char vectorap  pThe question was successfully answered and Im grateful to those who responded.  Mike DeSimone responded with an example of a sendmessage function that converts the data into a format that NetLink accepts an stdvector, which looks like thisp  precodevoid sendmessageNLSocket socket, uint16t opcode, const void rawData, sizet rawDataSize      vectorltunsigned chargt buffer     buffer.reservesizeofuint16t  rawDataSize     buffer.pushbackopcode gtgt 8     buffer.pushbackopcode amp 0xFF     const unsigned char basereinterpretcastltconst unsigned chargtrawData     buffer.insertbuffer.end, base, base  rawDataSize     socketgtrawSendampbuffer  codepre  pThis looks to be exactly what I needed, and so I set off to write an accompanying receivemessage function...p  p...but Im embarrassed to say that I dont entirely understand all the bitshifting and whatnot, so Ive run into a wall here.  In all the code Ive ever written in the past nearly decade, most of my code has been in higherlevel languages, and the rest of my code hasnt ever really called for lowerlevel memory operations.p  pBack on the subject of writing a receivemessage function, my starting point, as you might imagine, is NetLinks rawRead function, whose signature looks like thisp  precodevectorltunsigned chargt rawReadunsigned bufferSize  DEFAULTBUFFERSIZE, string hostFrom  NULL codepre  pIt looks like my code will start off something like thisp  precodevoid receivemessageNLSocket socket, uint16t opcode, const void rawData      stdvectorltunsigned char, stdallocatorltunsigned chargtgt buffer  socketgtrawRead     stdallocatorltunsigned chargt allocator  buffergtgetallocator  do I even need this allocator  I saw that one is returned as part of the above object, but...      ...  codepre  pAfter that first call to rawRead, it appears I would need to iterate through the vector, retrieving data from it and reversing bitshifting operations, and then return the data into rawData and  opcode.  Again, Im not very familiar with bitshifting I did some googling to understand the syntax, but I dont understand emwhyem the above sendmessage code requires shifting at all, so Im at a loss for my next step here.p  pCan someone help me to understand how to write this accompanying receivemessage function  As a bonus, if someone could help explain the original code so that I know for the future how it works particularly, how the shifting works in this case and why its necessary, that would serve to deepen my understanding much for the future.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1357 pSo with most unit testing utilities I have come across, you usually get access to a SetUp and TearDown function of some sort. While I see that this comes in very handy for almost every unit test, I was wondering how testing the initialization of objects should be handled I mean, in almost every other test, you would just let the SetUp function handle it. However, in most of the basic testing utilities I have worked with, SetUp gets called before emeveryem test. I have been wondering if you just do the initialization testing within the SetUp function, if one should make their own SetUp equivalent function that gets called explicitly at the beginning of tests not related to initialization testing, or if there is some other generally accepted practice I have not brought upp

Console.WriteLinemysentence has 0 words in it, fascinating huh, TextProcessor.CountWordsmysentence           Console.ReadLine         codepre  pMy question is Why is it necessary to wrap these static methods in a static class  It seems to serve no purpose. Is there a way I can have these methods on their own not wrapped in a class I know encapsulation is beneficial but I dont see the use for static methods wrapped in static class. Is there something I am missing stylistically or otherwise Am I completely barking up a silly tree Am I thinking too much p

Negative 1357 pWhen building a RESTful web service using Spring MVC, I feel Ive encountered a tricky situation when trying to combine Jackson JSON deserialization and JSR303 bean validation.p  pOne of the neat things about JSR303 validation is that one can return all validation errors associated with a target object rather than just fail on the first constraint violation though there is a fail fast mode if you want to use it. p  pImagine a scenario where you have a JSON payload such asp  precode    firstname Joe,    surname Bloggs,    age 25  codepre  pAnd then you have the object you wish to map top  precodepublic class Person      NotNull    private String firstname     NotNull    private String surname     Minvalue  0    private int age     ...  codepre  pMy issue with this setup is that if the client sends a String as the value for age, the whole Jackson deserialization process will fail without being able to specifically target the reason why it failed i.e. well never get as far as validating. Imagine, then, this payloadp  precode    age invalid  codepre  pIn this case, what Id like to return would be an errors response such asp  precode     errors  [       error           field firstname,          message Must not be null,       ,       error           field surname,          message Must not be null,       ,       error           field age,          message Must be numeric value greater than or equal 0,           ]  codepre  pThe simple way around this problem would be to simply specify the age field as type String and then convert the value when passing it on to, say, the persistence layer. However, I dont really like the idea of resorting to data transfer objects that use Strings in a blanket fashion  it just seems wrong to do that in terms of preserving a clean design.p  pAnother option I thought of would be to create a class such asp  precodepublic abstract class BindableValueltTgt      private String stringValue     private T value     public T getValue        ifvalue  null           value  fromStringstringValue              return value         protected abstract T fromStringString stringValue  codepre  pI could then create implementations such as IntegerValue, LongValue, DateTimeValue etc. of course also writing custom type adapters for Jackson. And then my Person class could bep  precodepublic class Person      NotNull    private StringValue firstname     NotNull    private StringValue surname     Minvalue  0    private IntegerValue age     ...  codepre  pThis is almost what I want but, unfortunately, the JSR303 annotations such as NotNull and Min are not going to recognise my BindableValue implementations.p  pSo, can anyone explain a way I could solve this problem in a cleaner wayp

The convergence must not be permanent since the reward may modulate or the available actions could change.p  pWhat Id like to know is if there are any current python libraries preferably crossplatform as I necessarily change environments between Windoze and Linux that can do this sort of thing already or may support it with suitable customization eg derived class support that allows redefining say reward method with ones own.p  pIm finding information about online permove MDP learning is rather scarce.

Negative 1357 pWe are rewriting some applications previously developed in Visual FoxPro and redeveloping them using .Net  using C  p  pHere is our scenario Our application uses smartcards. We read in data from a smartcard which has a name and number. The name comes back ok in readable text but the number, in this case 900 comes back as a 2 byte character representation 131 amp 132 and look like this  p  pThose 2 special characters can be seen in the extended Ascii table.. now as you can see the 2 bytes are 131 and 132 and can vary as there is no single standard extended ascii table  as far as I can tell reading some of the posts on here p  pSo... the smart card was previously written to using the BINTOC function in VFP and therefore the 900 was written to the card as . And within foxpro those 2 special characters can be converted back into integer format using CTOBIN function.. another built in function in FoxPro..p  pSo  finally getting to the point   So far we have been unable to convert those 2 special characters back to an int  900  and we are wondering if this is possible in .NET to read the character representation of an integer back to an actual integer.p  pOr is there a way to rewrite the logic of those 2 VFP functions in Cp  pstrongUPDATEstrong After some fiddling we realise that to get 900 into 2bytes we need to convert 900 into a 16bit Binary Value, then we need to convert that 16 bit binary value into a decimal value.p  pSo as above we are receiving back 131 and 132 and their corresponding binary values as being 10000011  decimal value 131  and 10000100  decimal value 132 . When we concatenate these 2 values to 1000001110000100 it gives the decimal value 33668 however if we removed the leading 1 and transform 000001110000100 to decimal it gives the correct value of 900... p  pNot too sure why this is though... p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Meanwhile the contentInset of the UITableView is set to 30px at the top and the contentOffset is set to 30px.p  pAll this happens in a UIView Animation that nicely pushes the bar on the view and moves the tableview content down a little, without losing the ability to scroll the content behind the semitransparent bar later on.p  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]         [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectoraddMessageView nameSomethingHappened objectnil]    voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated      [super viewDidAppearanimated]         [self.tableView flashScrollIndicators]    voidaddMessageView       self.statusMessageView  [[FFStatusMessageView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, kMessageViewHeight, self.view.frame.size.width, kMessageViewHeight]     self.statusMessageView.autoresizingMask  UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth       void animationsvoid           [self.view addSubviewself.statusMessageView]         self.statusMessageView.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, kMessageViewHeight         self.tableView.contentInset  UIEdgeInsetsMakekMessageViewHeight, 0,0,0         if self.tableView.contentOffset.y  0 self.tableView.contentOffset  CGPointMake0, kMessageViewHeight           [UIView animateWithDuration0.4 animationsanimations]  codepre  pThe result looks very nice.

Negative 1357 pI need a tool similar to cdb constant database that would allow me to store large sets of data in the range of hundreds of gigabytes in indexed files. CDB is an ideal candidate but it has a 2 GB file size limit so its not suitable.  The functionality Im looking for is a persistent keyvalue store supporting binary keys and values. After creating the database is read only and will never be modified. Can you recommend some tool And btw, storage overhead should be small because I will be storing billion of records.p  pBTW Im looking for a db management library embeddable, not a standalone server. Something that can be used inside a C program.p  pThanks, RGp

Negative 1357 pHow can I retrieve a disks identifier on Windows This is not to be confused with the volume identifier theyre two different things. The disk identifier is the 4byte identifier that resides in the MBR or 16byte identifier if it uses GPT. If you run diskpart and query the details of a disk, its the value labeled Disk ID.p  pIve run through all of the MSDN documents that looked relevant, but I havent managed to find anything capable of doing this evidently it is possible, though, seeing as diskpart is able to get this value from somewhere.p  pI could always invoke diskpart as a last resort and parse its output, but Id really prefer to avoid doing that.

Negative 1357 pI dont know if this is a problem with Ubuntu, VirtualBox or nginx.p  pI am running nginx on Ubuntu, which is a VirtualBox guest on Windows 7.  A Windows 7 folder is mounted as a automount, readonly Shared Folder in VirtualBox.  Ubuntu sees the folder as mediasfjsourcep  pNow, if I edit a file in that folder on Windows 7, a shell command cat on Ubuntu sees the new content.  That would seem to imply that VirtualBox and Ubuntu are picking up the new changes just fine.p  pHowever, the nginx server running on Ubuntu keeps serving the stale content.  That suggested that the problem was with nginx caching files.  I googled around and saw a couple of entries from 2010, 2011 to disable the nginx cache.  However, I have not enabled any cache in the nginx config, and I dont see any varcachenginx or optcachenginx directory to purge.p  pNow, the funny thing is that restarting nginx doesnt fix the problem.  I have to restart the Ubuntu guest for nginx to see the new content, which doesnt make sense since cat in Ubuntu was seeing the changes anyway before reboot.p  pPretty much everything nginx, Ubuntu, VirualBox is the latest version as of early 2012.p

Negative 1357 pIm using C2DM in my application, and I have a receiver, which sends data to a class in the application. The class creates a notification and notifies the notification manager to post  it. p  pThe problem is that this does not work when the app is forced close manually through the settings, as this also apparently shuts off the broadcast receiver. p  pWhat I get though is that when an app is shut off with android 4.0s new task manager the one thats similar to 3.0 but a user can also swipe an app to the left or right to shut it off it behaves differently the broadcast receiver is still working, as I get the intent from the C2DM message, but for some reason my phone still plays the notification noise, whilst no notification appears in the tray. p  pI cant figure out whats happening, because there is no way for the sound to play without the notification to appear, as the sound is attached to the notification and plays when its posted, no other way. But no notification appears. p  pAny insight on why this might be happening would be awesome, or what the new 4.0 task manager actually does to apps when you swipe them off the list.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1357 pWe just discovered a new problem with our registration scheme on Windows 7 64 bit edition.  Currently we save a hidden registration file inside our applications resources but it has become clear that this is not the best place for this.  Today we discovered that on Windows 7 64 bit edition when an application tries to create a file inside program filesx 86.. it actually ends up in the users appData inside the virtualStore.  This becomes a serious problem when a different user tries to use the software from a different account because the virtualStore is specific to the users account and the user gets asked to register the software again.  p  pI am wondering where do people usually put these kinds of registration files  p

Negative 1357 pIve read some posts saying using this method is not good, shouldnt been use, its not the right way to close the application and its not how android works... p  pI understand and accept the fact that Android OS knows better then me when its the right time to terminate the process, but I didnt heard yet a good explanation why its wrong using the killProcess method. After all  its part of the android API...   p  pwhat I do know is that calling this method while other threads doing in potential an important work operations on files, writing to DB, HTTP requests, running services.. can be terminated in the middle, and its clearly not good.    also I know I can benefit from the fact that reopen the application will be faster, cause the system maybe still holds in memory state from last time been used,  and killProcess prevents that.  p  pBesides this reason, assuming I dont have such operations, and I dont care my application will load from scratch each run,  there are other reasons why not using the codekillProcesscode methodp  pI know about finish method to close an Activity, so dont write me about that please..  codefinishcode is only for codeActivitycode. not to all application, and I think I know exactly why and when to use it...p  pAnd another thing  Im developing also games with the Unity3D framework, and exporting the project to android. When I decompiled the generated apk, I was very suprised to find out that the java source code created from unity  implementing Unitys  codeApplication.quitcode method, with codeProcess.killProcessProcess.myPidcode. p  pcodeApplication.quitcode is suppose to be the right way to close game according to Unity3d guides is it really maybe I am wrong, and missed something, so how it happens that the Unitys framework developers which doing a very good work as it seems implemented this in native android to codekillProcesscodep

Negative 1357 pstrongDissclaimerstrong This question is hard to answer directly, and you will need to have a good understanding of scrapy and program sequencing to answer it. It is hard for me to shrink wrap the question into something easier to directly answer.p  pAFAIK one cannot return requests from the item pipeline handlers. I am trying to parse all posts in a certain category from a forum. My strategy of traversing the forum is as follows  p  ol liBuild a list of all pages within a category and send them to the downloader to retrieve.li liRetrieve all topics within each page and send them into the item pipeline.li liWait for all page items to be processed inserted into a relational database and then start traversing every topic. li ol  pIm having trouble figuring out how to sequence step 3. I am using the following two objects listed at end in order to assist in the sequencing logic. codecategoryprocesspagecode is the request handler used in traversing the topic pages. p  pIn the category class  p  pThe end of phase 1 represents all topic pages having been received.  The end of phase 2 signifies the item pipeline having handled the ground work for all topics.p  pThe topic class, which represents all the topics in a particular topic listing page, the end of phase 1 signifies all topics in a page having been sent to the database. Once each topic in a page has been added to the db the page is removed from the category  and once all pages are done the crawler should move onto downloading all topics.p  pSo, how do I block the downloader so that it can wait for category phase 2 to end, via logic that is run in the item pipeline  Is there some machinery in scrapy for this  perhaps I can restart the downloader logic from within the item pipeline  p  pThere are probably a plethora of ways to do this, but Im new to Python and a C  C system programmer.p  pstrongNotestrong My initial design was to be done in 34 different spiders. One retrieves the forum heirarchy, the second one downloads all topics, the third one retrieves all posts, and the fourth one marks topics that need to be updated. But, surely there must be a more natural solution to this problem, Id like to fold the last 3 spiders into one.p  pId accept an answer that spoon feeds the logic to start spiders without resorting to bash would be nice to be able to drive the spiders from a gui, I can then build a driver program and stick with my initial design.p  precode class TopicPageItemBundle   def initself,topicpageurl,categoryitembundle     self.url  topicpageurl     self.topics  set     self.topicsphase1  set     self.categoryitembundle  categoryitembundle    def addtopicself, topicurl     self.topics.addtopicurl     self.topicsphase1.addtopicurl    def topicphase1doneself, topicurl     self.topics.removetopicurl     if lenself.topicsphase1  0       return true     else       return false  class CategoryItemBundle   def initself,forumid     self.topicpages       self.topicpagesphase1  set     self.forumid  forumid    def addtopicpageself,topicpageurl     tpib  TopicPageItemBundletopicpageurl,self     self.topicpages[topicpageurl]  tpib      self.topicpagesphase1.addtopicpageurl     self.topicpagesphase2.addtopicpageurl    def processpageself, response     returnitems  []     tp  TopicPageresponse,self     pagenav  tp.nav     log.msgreceived   pagenav.makenavinfo, log.INFO      pagebundle  self.topicpages[response.url]      posts  tp.extractpostsself.forumid     for post in posts       if post  None         pagebundle.addtopicpost[url]         post[pagetopicbundle]  pagebundle     return returnitems     phase 1 represents finishing the retrieval of all topic pages in a forum   def topicpagephase1doneself, topicpageurl     self.topicpagesphase1.removetopicpageurl     if lenself.topicpagesphase1  0       return true     else       return false    def topicpagephase2doneself,topicpageurl     self.topicpagesphase2.removetopicpageurl     if lenself.topicpagesphase2  0       return true     else       return true  codepre

Some other code    codepre  pMy understanding is that whenever i exit the codeusingcode block, the codeDisposecode method of the codeObjectContextcode class base class of MLEntities is called, which i guess releases any unmanaged resources, specifically in this case, the database connection. But since im holding a reference to the context object through codethis.ClientList  context.Clients.ToListcode the context doesnt get garbagecollected. Right  p  pNow for some instantiated context objects, while the application is running i need to know if they are still being held, being used by the application, or theyve been released. I dont have any reference of the context outside the codeusingcode block, but even if i had any, an attempt to use that reference would make the context object being used by the application. So how can i do it Any suggestion is appreciated. Thanks.  p  pstrongEDIT strong Actually i didnt mean to say that im holding a direct reference to the context object. Honest mistake. What i meant is, since codeClientscode is a property of the context and through codethis.ClientListcode im holding a reference to codeClientscode, as long as the current object that instantiating the context lives with codethis.ClientListcode,wont it keep the context object alive toop

Negative 1357 pI was playing with codeptrdifftcode and reading the C11 standard when I came across this issue. First, the factsp  pThe type codeptrdifftcode just an example is pulled from the Standard C library header codeltstddef.hgtcode into codeltcstddefgtcode 18.22. Section 17.6.1.2 tells us that declarations pulled from the C standard library will be within the codestdcode namespacep  blockquote   pIn the C standard library, however, the declarations except for names which are defined as macros in C are within namespace scope 3.3.6 of the namespace codestdcode. It is   unspecified whether these names are first declared within the global namespace scope and are then injected into namespace codestdcode by explicit emusingdeclarationsem 7.3.3.p blockquote  pAs it also says, the declarations may have been declared in global namespace first and then injected into codestdcode. So it would make sense, for my implementation, that the following compiles just finep  precodeinclude ltcstddefgt  int mainint argc, const char argv[]    stdptrdifft x   ptrdifft y   return 0  codepre  pMy implementation gcc 4.6.3 must have declared codeptrdifftcode in the global namespace and then injected it into codestdcode. However, if I compile the following code, I get an error notice the codeltiostreamgtcode includep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  int mainint argc, const char argv[]    stdptrdifft x   ptrdifft y   return 0  codepre  blockquote   pmain.cpp In function int mainint, const charbr   main.cpp63 error ptrdifft was not declared in this scopebr   main.cpp63 note suggested alternativesbr   usrincludec4.6i686linuxgnu.bitscconfig.h15628 note   stdptrdifftp blockquote  pSo, since codestdptrdifftcode is available, codeltiostreamgtcode must be including codeltcstddefgtcode in some way although its not required to. But why is the global version not also available as it  was before Can I not expect this injection to be consistent even when its actually the same header This seems like odd behaviour. Whether the injection occurs may be unspecified, but it should at least be either one way or the other, not both, rightp

Negative 1357 pI am currently making a small program that represents a thermometer. I have 2 scrollbars that I can change that reflect the temperature. Both will move at the same time showing the temp in Kelvin and Rankine converted from Fahrenheit. The scale on the scrollbars is 50 to 250 so all the calculations are based on that. All I need to do now is get a rectangle i drew in the middle of them to fill in blue at the bottom when its cold and fill towards the top, gradually turning red, as the temperature rises. p  pIm not sure if I can just use a type of fill or maybe use the paint method Any insight would be appreciated.p

Negative 1357 pMy question is how to handle an Out of Memory error when decoding a byte array into a bitmap so I can do a rotation on it.  My code is as follows and before you say its a duplicate, I have tried using BitmapFactory.Options and setting the sample size to 2.  However the quality loss was far too bad to be acceptable.  Also it appears to only be happening on one device so maybe its a one off thing, however Im inclined to believe if it affects one, there will be 25 more like it later.  Also this is happening on the FIRST photo taken and this is the only work that this activity does with regards to bitmaps.

Negative 1357 pIm trying to write some basic soundediting programs in Java, but Ive been having a huge amount of trouble with my 16bit WAVE file format.p  pWhen I asked Java how many samples it thought my sound file had, it gave me a number twice as big as I expected. When I told Java to generate a sine wave of a 80000 byte samples, it played for 1 second instead of 2 even though the sample rate was about 40000 per second.p  pAfter some more searching, I realized the the frame size of my file was 2, that a sample was actually 2 bytes instead of one, and that this was called a 16bit audio file. As an experiment, I wrote my sound file to an array of bytes, set every other byte to 0, and played back the result. When I kept only the odd samples, the sound file played back with a tiny bit of static noise. When I kept only the even ones, that static noise played back on its own without the sound file. This makes me think that the even bytes contain the exact inverse of the static in the odd bytes, which contain the actual sound to be played. When played back together, the even bytes silence the static in the odd bytes, which increases the sounds fidelity.p  pa hrefhttphome.roadrunner.comjgglatttechwave.htmPOINTS relnofollow titleThis websiteThis websitea has a pretty good explanation of the basics of 16bit sound encodings. However, its not quite good enough for me to go ahead and start editing the file byte by byte. How can I do bytebybyte editing of a 16bit or larger sound file while still preserving its higher fidelity Whats the formula for encoding sound with 16 bits per sample instead of just 8p

Wed like you to be aware of the following charges       12.34 Spuznitz, LLC on 41       43.21 1800FLOWERS on 42 As always, you can view these transactions in our portal.  Thank you for your business codepre  pObviously some of the email contents will vary  the salutation John Smith, 123.45 on 2413, and the lines with transactions printed out.  Other parts We received  your last payment are very static.  I want to be able to match the static portions of the text and quantify that the dynamic portions are within certain reasonable limits I might know that the most transaction lines to be printed is 5, for example.p  pBecause I am concerned about data exfiltration, I want to make sure email that doesnt match this template never goes out  I want to examine email and quarantine anything that doesnt look like what I expect.  So I need to automate this template matching and block any email messages that are far enough away from matching.p  pSo the question is, where do I look for a filtering mechanism  Bayesian filtering tries to verify a sufficient similarity between a specific message and a nonspecific corpus, which is kind of the opposite problem.  Things like Perls Template module are a tight match  but for output, not for input or comparison.  Simple diff type comparisons wont handle the limited dynamic info very well.p  pHow do I test to see if these outgoing email messages quack like a duckp

Until here everything is easy but the skills table actually represents a tree of skills for example the skill Coding has .Net and Java as children, while .Net has WCF and ASP.NET as children and Java has JSF and Struts as children. The Skills tree is modeled in the skills table with a column called QParentIDeach skill has a single direct parent. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5bsrZ.png altenter image description herep  pIt can happen that an employee only has a relation to WCF or ASP.NET as skills, but when i search for the employees with the skills .NET I should get these employees as well, along with the ones that have a direct link to .NET.

Im using this query p  precodeSELECT ToID FROM Message WHERE ID LIKE ID codepre  pWhat it does is check the database for any messages containing the recipient as the users ID. If the database does in fact contain any message, then the program will display them in the textboxes. But in the case if more than 1 message, how would the database display them in the form The form has textboxes for p  ol liSender li liSubject li liDate.li ol  pThis is the query I hoped to use for retrieving the messagep  precodeSELECT ID, Title, Body, Date, FromUsername FROM Message WHERE ID LIKE ID codepre  pPlease help Any other solutions are fine as long as its easy to understandim new to vb. p

But I would like the player to be able to hit any side top,left,right,bottom of the object and be placed appropriately. img srchttpi.imgur.comzu4ikkB.png1 altBlock collision example image So looking at the image above, basically I am trying to create collision between the black square and the rest of the objects. The black square is the player object, the gray squares are numberd wall objects, and the red square is the next level object. I have accomplished this, but it is kind of messy and when it comes to moving the wall objects, the player collision no longer works as I would like it too. So anyway here is my walls codesp  precodevar canvasWalls1  document.getElementByIdcanvasWalls var ctxWalls1  canvasWalls.getContext2d var walls1  new Walls1 var imgSprite  new Image imgSprite.src  sprite.png imgSprite.addEventListenerload,init,false  WallLeft.prototype.draw  function      ctxWalls1.drawImageimgSprite,this.srcX,this.srcY,this.width,this.height,this.drawX,this.drawY,this.width,this.height this.checkHitPlayer  WallLeft.prototype.checkHitPlayer  function  if this.drawX gt player1.drawX ampamp this.drawX lt player1.drawX  player1.width ampamp this.drawY gt player1.drawY ampamp this.drawY lt player1.drawY  player1.height  player1.isUpKey  false player1.isDownKey  false player1.isRightKey  false player1.isLeftKey  false player1.drawX  this.drawX  player1.width  0.05 player1.drawY  this.drawY  0.05         codepre  pI just copied the same code for wall1,2,3,.. etc. Im sure there is a better way of doing this is if anybody could maybe suggest a better one Iv tried drawing the same sprite in 2 different places, but cant figure out how to properly achieve this. The main reason I have different walls objects is because I need to draw the player object In a different position depending on where the player collides with the wall object.  If the player flys in from the Left, codeplayer1.drawX  walls1.drawX  player widthcode. But if the player flys in from the top, codeplayer1.drawY  walls1.drawY  player1.heightcode. The reason I need all collisions to be able to happen on any wall object, Is because i reuse all of the wall objects whenever the player object reaches the finish. If i knew of a better system, maybe I could continue using the collision system I have. anyways here is what happens when the player hits the finish objectp  precodeFinish.prototype.checkHitPlayer  function  if this.drawX gt player1.drawX ampamp this.drawX lt player1.drawX  player1.width ampamp this.drawY gt player1.drawY ampamp this.drawY lt player1.drawY  player1.height  increaseLevel   function increaseLevel  Level1 if Level2  drawlevel2  function drawlevel2  player1.drawX  288 player1.drawY  160 walls1.drawX  448 walls1.drawY  160 walls2.drawX  416 walls2.drawY  320 walls3.drawX  192 walls3.drawY  288 finish1.drawX  224 finish1.drawY  96  codepre  pAgain I have accomplished collision between the player and the walls, but only by creating a separate function for every wall, which doesnt work when I want to draw the walls in different places. I apologize if this seems like a lot to read, I tried to only include the relevant code. Any helpsuggestions is much appreciated.p
Negative 1357 pWe have an application for tagging user selections over a large corpus of MS Word documents. We tag these selections with one or more keyword tags, and usually a title tag. We want to add a feature where the selected text is instantly analyzed, and the tagger is presented with a list of mostlikely keyword and title tags based on the existing tagged text selectionsp  pWe are using a SOLR index. I have been told that we can simply issue the selected text as the query itself to return similar selections. However, the selected text could be anywhere between 200 and 6000 words long. A 6000 word query may be a problem in terms of memory usage p  pI thought we could do some very aggressive stopword removal to significantly reduce the number of words in the queries, leaving only the very meaningful words. We have been working with this corpus for the last 10 years and we are very familiar with the subject matter and the vocabulary used, so this would be easy for us to do. But the problem is that we also use the same index for allowing the normal users to search the index, and if we remove too many common words, then their normal queries may not work properly especially phrase queries.p  pWe would also like to boost the results that contain the text of the query within a smaller range, rather than just spread arbitrarily throughout the document.p  pAnother issue is that we allow nested selections. The outer selection may be more general in nature and be around 5000 words long, and the inner selections will be shorter and topically more specific. However, since both selections contain the same text, SOLR ranks them both highly, when the outer selection may not be so relevantp  pI have spent the last few days going through the SOLR query parser documentation, and it looks like this should be doable, but Im still not sure exactly what I need to do to make this work. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1357 pIm testing the create method on a controller for my Viewings model with RSpec.

Do I need to be using a class other than Viewing to stub out the method Should I just be calling viewing.stub instead of Viewing.anyinstance Actually I think typing that may have answered my own question, but Id still like to hear anyones thoughts on the issue. p

Negative 1357 pI want to create own simple recommendation system, about books. But there are some problems  its impossible at least, very hard for one person to organize training data set for algorithms. p  pSo, are there any free data sets or quizzes with information about peoples votes, which books and how much they likep  pSecond question is about books parameters. For some itembased predictions is really must have to use books ratings e.g. language, average length of words, average number of words in paragraph, i have counted about 30 parameters like those and their weights for example, books language is rated in 1 point, and average length of words in 0.314. So, are there any prepared information about that p  pIn fact, if i got an answer for first question, i could find solution for second question, but i am sure, that needed information exists.p  pAlso, i am reading Recommender Systems Handbook, it gives full information with references, but it is hard to read. Can you advise some extra books in this casep

Im trying to navigate to an element in HTML by Xpath, and cant seem to get it to function properly.p  pI want to grab a span from the html contents of a page. The page is fairly complex, so Ive been using Firebugs get element by xpath and pasting the result into my code. Ive noticed its slightly different than the xpath you get from doing the same thing in Chrome, but they both seem to direct to the same place.p  pThe html Im trying to navigate is a hrefhttpnl.newsbank.comnlsearchweArchivesssitelocNL2amppqueryname4000amppactionsearchamppproductNewsLibraryamppthemenewslibrary2ampssearchtypecustomizedampdsourceslocationampdplaceUnited20Statesamppnbidamppfieldpsudosort0psudosortampfmultiamppmultiamppwidesearchsmartamppsortYMDdate3aDamppmaxdocs200amppperpage10ampptextbase0SEARCHTERMamppfieldbase0amppboolbase1ANDampptextbase1amppfieldbase1Sectionamppboolbase2ANDampptextbase2amppfieldbase2ampptextYMDdate0April12001toApril12012amppfieldYMDdate0YMDdateamppparamsYMDdate0date3aB,EamppfieldYMDdate3YMDdateamppparamsYMDdate3date3aB,EampSearch.x18ampSearch.y18 relnofollowfound herea.

It works for the provided URL that the answerer gave me seen above. However when I try to use even simple xpath expressions on the a hrefhttpnl.newsbank.com relnofollowhttpnl.newsbank.coma url, I get errors that no object has been retrieved every time, no matter how basic the xpath.p  pEdit 3 I thought Id elaborate a little more on the big picture of the larger problem Im trying to solve of which this problem is a critical component in the hopes that maybe it provides a little more insight.p  pTo learn basic ASP.NET development skills from scratch, I decided to make a simple web application, based around the news archive search at a hrefhttpnl.newsbank.com relnofollowhttpnl.newsbank.coma. In its current iteration, it sends a POST request although Ive now learned you can use a GET request and just dump the body at the end of the URL to send search criteria, as if the user entered criteria in the search bar. It then searches the response using RegExes, not Xpath because I couldnt get that working for the Results 1emnem of emnem span, extracts emnem, and dumps it in a table. Its a cool little tool for looking up news occurrence rates over time.p  pI wanted to add functionality such that you could enter a date range say May 2002  June 2010 and run a frequency search for every month  week in that range. This is very easy to implement conceptually. HOWEVER the problem is, right now all this happens server side, and since theres no API, the HTTP response contains the entire page, and is therefore very bandwidth intensive. Sending dozens of queries at once would swallow absolutely unspeakable amounts of bandwidth and wouldnt be even a little scalable.p  pAs a result I tried rewriting the application to work clientside. However because of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSameoriginpolicy relnofollowsameorigin policya Im not able to send a request to an external host from the clientside. HOWEVER there is a loophole that I can use a free Yahoo proxy that makes the request and converts it to JSON, and then I can use the JSON exception of the SameOrigin Policy to retrieve that data from the proxy.  p  pHeres where Im running into these xpath problems specific to a hrefhttpnl.newsbank.com relnofollowhttpnl.newsbank.coma. Im not able to retrieve html with any xpath, and Im not sure why or how I can fix it. When debugging in VS2010, Ill receive the error codeMicrosoft JScript runtime error Unable to get value of the property content object is null or undefinedcodep

Negative 1357 pI noticed that even if you set your wildcard to match code.txtcode files only, all codewx.FileDialogcode does is list all txt files under that directory, still you can input any existent file with a different extension and hit open button without having any problem at all p  pThere doesnt seem to exist a window style to avoid this from happening, so I guess you have to validate the file extension yourself, right Interesting, does this count as a bugp

Negative 1357 pBasically, I have implemented an observable object and another class i.e. Subscriber which has a callback function in its prototype.p  pIn the callback, I want to do something with the classs properties, therefore, the this has to be set correctly.  Heres an example.p  precodeSubscriber  function      this.pararmA  1   Subscriber.prototype.OnValueChanged  functionvalue     alertthis.paramA  value  codepre  pIn my observable, listener has to be unique i.e. same listener is not allowed to be added into the subscriber list more than once.  Now below is the test.p  precodevar a  Observable0 var b  new Subscriber  a.AddListenerb.OnValueChanged.bindb a.AddListenerb.OnValueChanged.bindb  a1 a2 codepre  pWhat I expected is I see an alert of 2 and 3 once but instead I saw an alert of 2 and 3 twice due to the 1st b.OnValueChanged.bindb is identical to the 2nd b.OnValueChanged.bindbp  pIf I add the following code to the previous block of codep  precodevar c  b.OnValueChanged.bindb var d  b.OnValueChanged.bindb  alert c  d  codepre  pI will get a popup saying falsep  pSo I was thinking to put all the callbacks into the class instead of the prototypep  pi.e. p  precodeSubscriber  function      this.pararmA  1      this.OnValueChanbed  functionvalue         alertthis.paramA  value     .bindthis  codepre  pThen in the code just use the callback as it isp  precodevar a  Observable0 var b  new Subscriber  a.AddListenerb.OnValueChanged a.AddListenerb.OnValueChanged codepre  pThis solution seems ok but then every object with callbacks will have a copy of the callback functions because using prototype should reduce memory consumptionp

Negative 1357 pI am having an issue I can not figure out.  I created an SSIS package that uses a SQL command to retrieve data from Server2.  The query is very simple, however, it references a view in a join.  If I execute the SSIS package manually on Server1, it retrieves 925 rows and inserts it into the appropriate table in Server1. The problem starts when I schedule this SSIS package to run nightly.  It succeeds on the first step truncating the table on Server1 in preparation for retrieving the rows from Server2, but, when I look at the table, there are 0 rows.  When I modify the Query to remove the join that references a view getting undesired results, the scheduled SSIS works perfectly, although the recordset I get back is not what I wanted, because I need that JOIN.  I dont see how it can be a permissions issue as it works fine without the VIEW.  Is there something Im missing  Thanks for the help.p  pThe following query works only if I execute the SSIS manually  FilteredAccount is a VIEW It should return over 900 rows and does if I run manually, but returns 0 if executing the SSIS via Agent.p  precodeSELECT B.epccosmid, A.consultant, A.region FROM Consultant2TC AS A JOIN FilteredAccount AS B ON A.consultant  B.epcserviceconsultantidname codepre  pIf I change the query to the one below  in the SSIS package and schedule it, it works finep  precodeSELECT A.consultant, A.region FROM Consultant2TC AS A codepre

The entire system is defined by the interface of the codeStatecode classp  ol liBoth the state machine and the substates implement codeStatecodeli liThe state machine keeps a pointer to all possible codeStatecodes and the current codeStatecodeli liWhatever method of codeStatecode is called on the state machine, it is undiscerningly forwarded to the current state.li ol  pSo, we can totally make this a class template, right Lookp  precodetemplatelt class StateInterface gt class StateMachine  public StateInterface       public methods already declared in StateInterface  protected     stdlistltStateInterfacegt states     void AddStateStateInterface state     StateInterface currentState   class PlayerStateInterface  public     virtual int Run  0     virtual int Jump  0     virtual int Stop  0   class Player  public StateMachinelt PlayerStateInterface gt  public         virtual int Run  currentStategtRun  do stuff       virtual int Jump  currentStategtJump  do stuff       virtual int Stop  currentStategtStop  do stuff    codepre  pOf the above points, this has 1 and 2 covered, but what about 3 I still have to manually delegate the calls to the current state in the concrete state machine implementation. Is there a way to move that functionality to the codeStateMachinecode template Can I somehow express that whenever a method of codeStateInterfacecode is called on codeStateMachinecode it should call the same method on codecurrentStatecode, when I dont know the names or signatures of codeStateInterfacecodes methodsp

Negative 1357 pI am working on an iOS ARC app more code available on request, and earlier I was producing and discarding large numbers of images. I thought that I somewhere still had a reference to images, even if I called removeFromSuperview and tried to remove all references to nolongerused images. I tried Leaks, and Leaks reported roughly linear increase in memory usage over time, starting around 17M.p  pI went through and replaced all references to images to be instance variables, so they would take a small, finite, and fixed amount of memory, and transformed, instead of getting rid of, the images used for clock hands. This, unfortunately, resulted in slowly increasing memory usage over time, starting at 5M rather than 17M, but otherwise the same problem, simply translated to a better starting point.p  pA trimmed version of my code is below. Could you tell me what is leaky or pseudoleaky as Leaks did not indicate a leak about this and how I can stay close to the memory bounds the code uses when it starts upp  pThanks,p  precode void renderScreen  int height  floor[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.height  .4 int width  floor[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.width  .4  if height  2048  height  2008  height  1024  height  1004  height  984      if UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultPortrait.png]          else              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultLandscape.png]       else if height  1536  height  768  height  748  height  728      backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultLandscape.png]  else if height  1136  height  1116  height  1096      if UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefault568.png]          else              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultRotated568.png]       else if height  960  height  940  height  920  height  480  height  460  height  440      if UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefault.png]          else              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultRotated.png]       else if height  640  height  620  height  600 ampamp width  1136  width  1116  width  1096      backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundRotated568.png]  else if height  640  height  620  height  600  height  320  height  300  height  280 ampamp width  960  width  940  width  920  width  480  width  470  width  410      if UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultPortrait.png]          else              backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultRotated.png]       else      backgroundImage  [UIImage imageNamedBackgroundDefaultPortrait.png]   if UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation      int juggle  height     height  width     width  juggle  NSUInteger centerX  width  .5 NSUInteger centerY  height  .5  containerRect  CGRectZero containerRect.size  [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size  self.view.backgroundColor  [UIColor colorWithPatternImagebackgroundImage] backgroundView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImagebackgroundImage] [self.view addSubviewbackgroundView] if changed      containerView  [[UIView alloc] initWithFramecontainerRect]   double timeStampSeconds  [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970] double hours    fmodtimeStampSeconds  86400, 24 double minutes  fmodtimeStampSeconds   3600, 60 double seconds  fmodtimeStampSeconds,     60 NSLogMilliseconds lf, Hours .0f, minutes .0f, seconds .0f, timeStampSeconds  1000.0, hours, minutes, seconds [containerView removeFromSuperview] containerView  [[UIView alloc] initWithFramecontainerRect] hourHandImage  [UIImage imageNamedhourhand.png] hourHandView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImagehourHandImage] hourHandImage  [UIImage imageNamedhourhand.png] hourHandView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImagehourHandImage] [self.view addSubviewhourHandView]  hourHandView.layer.anchorPoint  CGPointMake0.5f, 0.5f hourTransform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslationcenterX, centerY hourTransform  CGAffineTransformTranslatehourTransform, 17, 127 hourTransform  CGAffineTransformRotatehourTransform, hours  12.0  MPI  2.0 minuteTransform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslationcenterX, centerY minuteTransform  CGAffineTransformTranslateminuteTransform, 10, 182 minuteTransform  CGAffineTransformRotateminuteTransform, minutes  60.0  MPI  2.0 hourHandView.transform  hourTransform minuteHandImage  [UIImage imageNamedminutehand.png] minuteHandView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImageminuteHandImage] minuteHandView.transform  minuteTransform [self.view addSubviewminuteHandView] minuteTransform  CGAffineTransformRotateminuteTransform, minutes  60.0  MPI  2.0 secondHandImage  [UIImage imageNamedsecondhand.png] secondTransform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslationcenterX, centerY secondTransform  CGAffineTransformTranslatesecondTransform, 10, 189 secondTransform  CGAffineTransformRotatesecondTransform, seconds  60.0  MPI  2.0 secondHandView  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImagesecondHandImage] secondHandView.transform  secondTransform [self.view addSubviewsecondHandView]  codepre  pEDITp  pI have refactored the one method into two methods, one for initial display, and one for incremental updates.

Negative 1357 pIs there a standard common directory under Windows 7 to which all users have Full Control access to write data  We have an application under Win 7 that runs on special workstations which needs to write logfiles for debugging.  The app is written in Java and uses logback to log.p  pI am tearing my hair out over not being in control of anything on these workstations.  We ask that Full Control be granted to all users for our logfile directory, and maybe they do, maybe they dont but then Policy gets applied and the application cant writedeleterename logfiles as it needs to.  I have been around the block over and over on this.p  pI am not worried about malicious activity.  Group policy ALREADY prevents the user from using Windows Explorer, Office, command line, IE or anything other than our application.  They cant do anything not under our programs control.  But I cant get to a situation where I know that the logging will always behave the way I want it to.  If one person logs onto the machine and then someone else does, questions of file ownership get in the way of the program doing what it needs to do.p  pSo my question is there a directory which  by default  is always open to whatever user happens to be logged in  to run a program that writes, deletes, and renames files regardless of which user created them originallyp  pstrongUPDATE in response to Remy Lebeaus answerstrongp  pRemy, in a comment below, points me toward what I was looking for. However, there are two issues with that. p  ol liI said our application was written in Java and as such, as far as I know, does not have access to the APIs mentioned in his links, so we would be restricted, as far as I know, to hardcoding a path such as CDocuments and SettingsAll UsersApplication Data. This is not a showstopper but less than ideal.li lipMore significantly, I have tried this and it doesnt work in my case. In cmd window I can cd into this directory, and apparently copy files into it. copy command says it succeeded, but then a dir command doesnt show it, and I, a user on my own PC with admin rights, cannot view the directory in Windows Explorer.  About this, two questions arisep  pa. What is up with this odd windows behavior in which actions for which user apparently lacks rights to execute say, for example, a file copy sometimes appear to succeed proceed without visible error and yet the operation does NOT actually complete.p  pb. Are all these problems the result of my corporation having a more restrictive group policy than normal which prevents these Microsoftdocumented directories from functioning as documented  How can I view the group policy so that I might intelligently request some relief from the people who administer these policiespli ol

Negative 1357 pEnvironment  Neo4j Community 1.8,2, Node.js 0.10.22, Debian squeeze, JDK 1.6.xp  pThe problem Im about to describe is very spurious and we are at a loss to figure out what in our code could be causing it.  So this is a shot in the dark...p  pAll of our Nodes are assigned a GUID property on creation via TransactionEventHandler plugin unless they have an existing GUID property. We have autoindexing enabled for this GUID property. This seems to work fine. The majority of our queries are GUIDbased.  That is, we often find Nodes by GUID as all or part of the query. Weve noticed that rarely an existing Node with guidA is overwritten with the properties of a justcreated Node with guidB. Note that in this case, the GUIDs were actually generated by a foreign system were importing users from one system into another. We can see this happening because we keep a version history for each GUID.  And we can see at the time that this problem occurs both guidA and guidB share the same Neo4j node id. It also emmightem be the case that a Node with guidB had been created and then deleted some time in the past.  We have to do more experimentation to confirm this.p  pOne hypotheses is thatp  ol lithe node with guidB was created in the past and had Neo4j id  1234.li liIt was then deleted which allowed id 1234 to be reused at some time in the future.  However, the guidB  1234 record still existed in the index.li liThe node with guidA was then created and was given Neo4j id 1234.li liThe user with guidB was then reimported into the system, looked up by GUID, and because the original record in the index still remained, the node with id 1234 was found.li liThe properties of the node with id n were then overwritten with guidBs user properties.li ol  pThe only reason I came up with this is because I know that the Lucene records are not immediately deleted when the associated node is deleted. Again, this happens infrequently and the key may be the deletion of the node.p  pAny possibility that this is an indexing bugp
Negative 1357 pIm kind of a programming noob FYI, however I have a decent amount of experience writing batch scripts.

If MEGA provided direct links, I could easily use wget to download the file. However, MEGA doesnt support direct links in any way.p  pThe only way I can think of to download it is to have the batch script communicate with the HTML on the download page such that I could execute the same actions as clicking the Download button on MEGA.

Ive tried doing an atoi on the string but obviously that doesnt work as I lose precision and the resultant value that I pass on to localtime results in an incorrect date. This is on iOS so some phones are 32 bit and some are 64 bit, and presently, I see that it has timet defined as a long. How do I convert this large epoch value to something I can ultimately get a human readable date fromp

Negative 1357 pI have created a android client server application which involves storing datetime values into database. The server is mssql server. The server side programming is done in c. The current time is stored in database as datetime2 value. The server time zone is US Mountain Standard Time. And its offset from GMT is 07 hours. That is server time is GMT7.00. My current local time is GMT05.30. I have developed this android app to work in GMT05.30 timezone. So I need to know how to convert the server time from GMT07.00 to GMT05.30. p  pI have founded off the server time and GMT using the following codes.p  precodeTimeZone zone  TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone DateTime serverDateTime.Now DateTime universalzone.ToUniversalTimeDateTime.Now GMT TIME I have found that My server offset from GMT is 07.00 using the below code TimeSpan offset  zone.GetUtcOffsetDateTime.Now  codepre  pWhen I enter the following values into my server database, it enters into table in this format.p  precodeHere my local time is 20140203 202508.0000000  my server time at that moment is 20140303 075528.0000000     the utc time at that moment is 20140303 145528.0000000  codepre  pSo in total there is a time difference of about 12 hours and 30 minutes from my server time and local time. If the server at this location goes down by any reason, then the server will run from another location with different time zone and different offset. So the difference between the server time and the local time changes sometimes. This causes a problem to my app, as my values are getting wrong some times. Is there any way to find out the offset when I require and calculate the time of my server and make it same as the local timep

Negative 1357 pWe have an object in our model, call it class X. There are several other classes in our model that have an instance of class X as a property, call them A, B, C, etc. This is essentially a onetoone mapping, since each X can only belong to one parent class. To map this relationship on the database side, we are currently using a foreign key to the X table in tables A, B, and C. For the NHibernate mappings, we are currently using, in the mappings for the A, B, and C classesp  precodeManyToOnea gt a.X, m gt m.CascadeCascade.All codepre  pThis mostly works for saving, retrieving, and updating our class Xs  weve had a lot of problems getting NHibernate codeOneToOnecode mappings to work right. The problem is that, when you take your persistent class A and replace its X with a new instance of X and then save that A instance, then the new X instance gets written to the database and the foreign key in the A column gets updated, but the old X does not get deleted, so we now have an orphan X.p  pWe would like those orphaned Xes to be automatically deleted. We would like NHibernate to do it, because X is a complex class with many relationships of its own to other tables that we have cascades set up to handle properly  I have a SQL script set up to delete orphan Xes properly, and its about 50 lines long.p  pWe are trying to avoid solutions that involve putting a reference in class X to its parent item, since there are a total of 5 classes that it can belong to, and situations such as class A has one X, class B has 2 Xes in named properties, etc.p  pThings Ive tried so farp  pAdding codeDeleteOrphanscode to the codeManyToOnecode mapping  doesnt workp  pcodeOneToOnecode mapping  really wants the key to be in the other table, and doesnt seem to support cascade deletes anyways.p  pAlso consideredp  pNHibernate doesnt seem to have any support for setting up some kind of even to trigger when things like updates or deletes happenp  pApparantly, only the codeOneToManycode and codeManyToManycode mappings support codeDeleteOrphanscode, so, I could make the actual property use some kind of list or set, and use getters and setters to make it look like a normal property to the rest of the model. Sounds very hacky, and it might require having a reference in X to the other classes.p  pDatabase trigger  I havent really checked if SQL Server triggers can be used in this way yet, but it sounds like a very awkward solution.p  pDoes anybody have any ideas for how to make this workp

Negative 1357 pI am attempting to use the Angular UI Bootstrap library and IE throws a 404 error when it tries to load the typeaheadpopup.html template, which is the only one Im using right now.

My custom library which I define using ... also does not load in IE, unless I put the physical file on the server in the appsearch.html directory.p  pAt this point I cant figure out what the difference is between IE and the other browsers. The only thing which seems odd to me is that IE is looking in the app directory for templates, but I wasnt sure if that was a angular thing to store the templatecached items there. Also it looks like Chrome and FF dont make a request for the template item at all, which makes sense because it should be stored only in the template cache.p  pIve tested in both IE10 and IE11 and it fails in both browsers, however chrome, safari, and ff all work fine.p

Then when the viewController receives an event from the toolbar, it loads the good controller from a strongstoryboardstrong and add its view p  pThis is where I have some layout issue. The loaded view controller is a search bar top0px left0px right 0px and a tableview under this searchBar top0px to the search bar, left  0px right  0px bottom 0pxp  pHowever there is a margin above the search bar and between the search bar and the tableview.

After I gone through a LOT of code and function calls I understand that whenever this variable will be set or no it seems it doesnt matter BUT its certain that this function retrieves the operation error data depends of a member of variable initialised by an Undocumented ntdll function call named NtGetCompleteWnfStateSubscription by its pointer. It was called from ntdll too. The structure of the variable member I mentioned is the followingp  precodestruct Unknown  AsyncStatus  32bit long dw0  it was set to 3 during the current operation as the AsyncStatuserror enum value so I think it should belong to it DWORD dw4 was set to 0x5F DWORD dw8 was set to 0x80073CF6 some generic error   codepre  pThe code in ntdll where the NtGetCompleteWnfStateSubscription function was called, initing the variable which member have this structure type in assembly, IDA PRO generatedp  precodentdll.dll77906200 loc77906200                            CODE XREF ntdll.dllntdllstrncpys1A3j ntdll.dll77906200 push    1030h ntdll.dll77906205 push    esi           the variable pointer ntdll.dll77906206 push    edi ntdll.dll77906207 push    eax ntdll.dll77906208 lea     eax, [ebp0Ch] ntdll.dll7790620B push    eax ntdll.dll7790620C push    ebx ntdll.dll7790620D call    near ptr ntdllNtGetCompleteWnfStateSubscription ntdll.dll77906212 test    eax, eax                 now [esi2Ch]  esi contains data from the Unkown structure and contains the operation error data ntdll.dll77906214 jns     short loc7790623F codepre  pThe above code is actually called 3 times but with the same esi pointer. So now my question is how to find where the error code is set to be retrieved using this function. I tried capturing most of the function in ntdll that looks like doing this but without success. I cant debug NtGetCompleteWnfStateSubscription for some strange reason. Any suggestions will be helpful. Im using IDA PRO 6.5, VS 2013 U1, Windows 8.1 x64 U1.p  pEDIT If you dont want to bother with problem specific details my generic question is how to locate where WinRT async methods sets the IAsyncInfoStatus property or what function or method is called when an error arrises while executing them.p

In order to keep track of that Im using a codeparencode start condition which increments a value whenever a paren is hit inside a paren statement, and removes it when a close paren is it.p  pThe problem is its just not working.

I think the rationale was that this extra precaution ensures that the person verifying the email address is the same person who created the account.p  pstrongQuestion does the above explanation make sense, and should I implement email verification by requiring passwordbased loginstrongp  pIt makes some sense to me, and at least it doesnt seem harmful  other than making the user experience slightly more cumbersome.  But I see many online services that do not require this, and I wonder why.p  pFor example, heres the scenario I worry about.  What if person 1 initially created the account but specified the wrong email address maliciously or accidentally, and it got sent to person 2.  If person 2 is naive, heshe might verify that email address by just clicking the link... and then forget about it.  Then person 1 could still login using the password.  Suppose person 1 does all sorts of bad stuff on that account.  Would person 2 be responsiblep  pI think an alternative solution might be to ask new users to first specify just an email address, then confirm that with a hashed token, and then ask them to set a password.  But I dont see very many online services that do it this way, either.p

Negative 1357 pI have a delphi application that loads custom mouse cursors by using codeLoadImageHinstance, PWideCharName, IMAGECURSOR, 0, 0, LRDEFAULTCOLORcode. These custom cursors have a size of 32x32, 48x48 or 64x64, depending of the users choice. If i load a custom cursor and move the mouse outside the application, the cursor changes to the windows default arrow one. But this arrow now has artifacts on the bottom side of the cursor.

Negative 1357 pI am creating a log in form in Java.  I have already completed the entire structure of the program, as well, I have designed its purpose and perfected its functionality.  However, now I am focusing on styling the program.  Im proud of it as it is and its fine if I dont add this feature, however I really would like to and cannot discover how.p  pIn summary, when a username is typed into the login form, I have a void that runs after the JTextField loses focus.  This void searches for possible invalid characters such as spaces.  I can successfully change the color of the border on my JTextField, and other attributes I wish to change, however I also would like to have a small dialogue box to hover over the JTextField to say what specifically is wrong with what was typed.  e.g. Your username cannot contain spaces.p  pIdeally, it would be a rectangle that could simply be filled with text, and only appear when the username is deemed incorrect, and be able to disappear when it is fixed  I can handle the appearance and disappearance most likely, I just need help with creating this box thing .p  pIs there any such thing as like a JHoverBox or something that I could add to my JTextFieldp

Negative 1357 pIs it possible to connect wearable emulator to handheld device which is connected to adb wirelessly  p  p1 First I connected my phone to adb wirelessly with the adb tcpip 5555 command.  2 Now, my phone is connected with adb by ip address assigned to it in local wlan. adb connect ipaddress  3 Now I started my emulator of wearable device and I want to connect that to that handheld device connected wirelessly. For normal connection, command for this is adb d forward tcp5601 tcp5601 but I know that this obviously wont work here. p  pSo my question here is  Is it possible to achieve this  Whether its a yes or no, can you explain me why  I dont have much idea about tcp ports etc. I tried to google it but could not find much information about it online. So, it would be great if you can explain me about this. p  pIt is written in adb help that forward command would forward the port depending on what you specify.

However, you can suppress this error by using the argument.p  precodeXXUseGCOverheadLimit codepre  pNow, my question is, where do I give this argument in the hadoop framework. I guess I have to provide it in mapredsite.xml. But how Currently the mapredsite.xml file looks like as shown below.

Negative 1357 pI need to send a structconsisting of booleans, ints and strings over a TCP socket.

Negative 1357 pIm trying to create a script, that when run, will output a text file of that computers specs.p  pIs there a program that offers command line interface to generating a text file containing simplified computer specifications on a Windows OSp  pJust the basic consumer info. ie RAM, CPU, HDD, etc.. I dont need or want every last detail about the computer. p  pI understand that MSinfo32, DxDiag, Speccy, offer export features however Speccy doesnt offer automation through CLI, and the other two simply export a glob of all system info. Much of which is personal and unnecessary for what I need.p  pThe only two workarounds I can think of is to either use a Windows equivalent of a grepcatawk command to sift out only the necessary info. Which could prove to be quite tedious seeing as how each system would, obviously, have different specs. Alternatively, use a program if one exists to specify which specs to gather and which ones to leave out.p

Negative 1357 pIm working on a project of agenda with Full Calendar linked with a database.

Ive succeeded in loading and displaying events from the database with correct background color.p  pHowever, I dont succeed to program point 1 and 2.

Negative 1357 pI am currently implementing a SASS compiler in Go  a hrefhttpsgithub.comc9sc6 relnofollowc6a, and I found some strange behaviors of the Ruby SASS compiler when I was writing the expression parser and evaluator.p  pThe SASS reference mentioned the plain CSS  and the SASS division expression here a hrefhttpsasslang.comdocumentationfile.SASSREFERENCE.htmldivisionandslash relnofollowhttpsasslang.comdocumentationfile.SASSREFERENCE.htmldivisionandslashap  pThe design is to make SASS compatible with native CSS syntax like thisp  precodefont 10px8px              Plain CSS, no division. looks fine. font 10px8px  3px        Expression font 10px8px            Expression codepre  pThe above seems OK, but if you writep  precode.foo    a 10px8px   font a  codepre  pAnd the above will be compiled top  precode.foo     font 1.25  codepre  pThe normal expression in the following SASS will always be expression without parenthesisp  precode.foo    padding 2px2px   padding 2px3  codepre  pOutputsp  precode.foo    padding 4px   padding 6px  codepre  pHowever the following SASS produces different resultsp  precode.foo    padding 2px1px   padding 2px  1px  codepre  pAnd the above will be compiled top  precode.foo    padding 2px1px  treated as ident instead of expression   padding 1px  codepre  pAnd it seems the division operator is the only exception for property value, which makes the syntax inconsistent and ambiguous. actually there are so many ambiguous grammars in the SASS specification...p  pSo here is the question p  ol lipHow can I make the expression syntax consistent and avoid the implicitly behavior between plain CSS  and divide operator if we dont consider the compatibility of SASSpli lipand what will you dopli ol  pThank youp

Negative 1357 pIn my engine, I want to avoid having line, and separate triangle types. I want to draw the lines using a triangle where 2 verts are identical. But in opengl, this triangle wont be displayed because it has zero area, and therefore cant cover a pixel.p  pInternally, at the driver level, an opengl line is drawn using a degenerate triangle, and a different rasterization rule is used where it draws at least one pixel per scanline.p  pD3d had some option where you could set the rasterization to always draw the first pixel per scan lineeffectively accomplishing what I want in d3d.p  pBut how can I do this with opengl I dont see any command that would allow you to change the rasterization rules. p

Negative 1357 pHi Im having a strange issue with Rails 4.2 namespaces and routing.p  pIm updating from rails 4.0.13 to Rails 4.2.1 and have a namespace route set up like sop  precodenamespace admin do   get , to dashboardindex, as    get denied, to dashboarddenied, as denied   get blocked, to dashboardblocked, as blocked   get approved gt dashboardapproved, as approved end codepre  pand a controller at appcontrollersadmindashboardcontroler.rb defined asp  precodeclass AdminDashboardController lt ApplicationController     redactednot important codepre  pOnce I start my server and hit the adminapproved endpoint the page loads fine.

Ive looked through the config docs to see if Im doing something wrong but nothing really jumped out at me.p  pAlso some context This is a project I inherited from another dev who no longer works on it and its quite messy and my hunch is there is a config somewhere thats causing this but Ive been away from Rails for a bit and am hoping the community can help me stop pulling my hair out p  pstrongUpdate 1strong Just wanted to clarify that the index route always works without issue but the denied, blocked and approved routes are the one that show this strange behavior of working once then magically rewriting the routes controller to something else and failing with uninitialized constant error.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I just tested Rails 4.1.10 and 4.2.0. The error is not present in 4.1.10 but it is present in 4.2.0. Im about to dive into actionpack to see if this is a real issue.p
Negative 1357 pIn my code Im trying to have users register as frequent flyers for my website. This is the registration page, where the users have to complete 3 forms. However, only the first form is displayed, and only on the submission of the first form, the second form is displayed. Its the same for the second and third form. I can get the second and third form to display, however when I submit the second form, the variables set from the first form are overwritten. How can I keep the variables from all the forms right up until submission of the final form Thanks in advancep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt    ltphp         sessionstart          firstnamestr

Negative 1357 pWe have a rails 3 app that makes heavy use of active resource and we are looking to upgrade to rails 4. From what Ive read it sounds like active resource was removed from rails 4 because of its threading model. ActiveResource has some really nice features, so it would be nice to keep it, but if theres a reasonable chance it will cause problems this might be a good time to look at alternatives.  Would appreciate any insights from anyone who may have already gone down this path.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1357 pI am currently learning MySQL for Java to integrate to one of my projects. Main reason behind this is because currently Im using files to store data, which is causing lag. After speaking to a few people most of them said switching to MySQl rather than files to handle data will fix that issue.      Anyways, Im confused on a few things in MySQL and was hoping somebody could answer them for me. Firstly, called the SELECT method, how exactly will that work If I do something like this p  pcodeResultSet res  statement.executeQuerySELECT  FROM tokens WHERE PlayerName    name   res.nextcodep  pWill that get me all the results for tokens db under the name column If thats the case how would I then get the actual token amount Also how would I create different databases, for example for the players score, tokens, kills, deaths, etc.p  pThank you, and hopefully this wasnt to nooby of a question Pp

Assuming a package of weiners contains 12 and a package of buns contains 8, this is what I have come up with so farp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcmathgt  using namespace std  void hotdogint a, int b      a  weiner packages, b  bun packages     int weiners  12  a     int buns  8  b     int total  weiners  buns  weiners  buns     int leftOverWeiners  total  weiners     int leftOverBuns  total  buns     int totalHotDogs  total  2      cout ltlt You can make  ltlt totalHotDogs ltlt  hotdogs ltlt endl      if leftOverWeiners gt 0         cout ltlt You have  ltlt leftOverWeiners ltlt  weiners left over though. ltlt endl     else if leftOverBuns gt 0         cout ltlt You have  ltlt leftOverBuns ltlt  buns left over though. ltlt endl        int main     int a     int b      cout ltlt Lets see how many hotdogs you can make ltlt endl     cout ltlt How many weiner packages did you purchase      cin gtgt a     cout ltlt How many bun packages did you purchase      cin gtgt b      hotdoga, b      return 0  codepre  pWith this, I can always get the correct answer if the ratio of buns to weiners is the same or if there are more weiners than buns.p  pBecause of the way Ive set up total andor leftOverBuns lines 9, 11, I will never get the correct answer to how many left over buns there will be. I know there must be a simpler way to do this if not a way to modify my current code but I am stumped. p  pI know I left virtually zero notation, so if you would like some please let me knowp

Negative 1357 pIve created a responsive web layout on two of my sites, and it works beautifully, but Im struggling to implement Google AdSense responsive ads. The ads work great on mobile, reloading on orientation changes, but on desktops, they break the layout whenever the browser window is resized. In some cases, they spill over, blocking content, which is a violation of AdSense policy.p  pI would ideally like to be able to signal the ads to reload, but I dont know if this is possible in a way that is allowed under googles policies.p  pAs a nextbest solution, I wrote javascript that hides the ads if the window is resized past a breakpoint, but the Google team informed me that this solution was in violation of their policies. Because its only a small portion of users that resize windows at any given time, the lost revenue from ads is not a big deal to mewhereas the broken layout, which looks unprofessional and makes a bad impressionis a big deal to me.p  pDo you know of any way to handle this situation gracefully, in line with Googles policies Have any of you successfully implemented responsive AdSense units in a way that solved this problemp

Negative 1357 pI have a question concerning styling elements on retina display devices that I was hoping someone could help me with. Please excuse my ignorance but Ive been attempting to understand this for a couple of hours now to no avail.p  pLets say that I have an image with a 44px width on a normal device screen. On a 2x retina display device, I would therefore use an 88px width version of this same image for it to display at the same physical size. p  pHowever, lets say that this image has a marginleft of 10px, for example. Why do I not have to create a style for the 2x retina device stating that the margin left should also be doubled to 20px, considering the increased pixel densityp  pI thought that maybe some sort of conversion would be done by the OS of the device youre using  However, when researching this issue by connecting my iPhone to my Mac and checking out marginpaddingetc definitions to see if any of them were being doubled, I saw that they were not being changed from what was defined in my stylesheet for nonretina devices. p  pHow can 16px of padding on a nonretina and 2x retina device look the same p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong  I researched this issue and think I have a better understanding of it now. Useful reading material as followsp  pa hrefhttpalistapart.comarticleapixelidentitycrisis relnofollowhttpalistapart.comarticleapixelidentitycrisisap  pa hrefhttpsdocs.webplatform.orgwikitutorialsunderstandingcssunits relnofollowhttpsdocs.webplatform.orgwikitutorialsunderstandingcssunitsap  pI didnt realise that a pixel could actually refer to numerous things. A CSS pixel is consistently computed as 196 of an inch across any device that you are using, whereas a hardware pixel is the smallest dot of colour that is possible to show on the screen.p  pCSS also interprets a devices resolution by the formula p  pdeviceresolutioncsspixelratiop  pSo lets say you had a device with an actual resolution of 720 x 1280 and a CSS pixel ratio of 2.

The goal is to iterate over a codelistltAnimalgtcode and perform some action with them using their specific behavior.p  pThe first thing that comes to mind is just casting the codeAnimalcodes using codedynamiccastcode or codestaticcastcode  codetypeidcode. But that approach is hard to maintain and can become quite slow if i have a bigger amount of objects to iterate over.p  pAfter some research i found the following ways to avoid RTTI and use virtual function calls insteadp  ol liDeclare every method an animal could possibly have as a virtual method in the codeAnimalcode class.li liUse a dynamicdispatch pattern, like the visitor pattern.li ol  pIn my opinion both of these approaches have their own flaws. The first one pollutes the animal class and its derived classes with a lot of abundant codeutility and you will need some methods like codebool canFlycode if you want to avoid specific function calls If the function guarantees some behavior on call for example.

Negative 1357 pI am trying to make a function to get an average on an arbitrary Collection of Numbers so this could be Integers, BigIntegers, Doubles etc.. Obviously for averaging it is necessary to add all the numbers and then divide by the number of elements. However in my function I am using the generic class codeE extends Number, Comparablecode therefore excluding AtomicInteger and AtomicLong.p  pIs there anyway I can use a generic function for adding Where can I find it If this is not possible, would it be best to convert the incoming numbers to BigDecimal without losing precision and then doing the calculations and somehow doing the conversion back to type Ep  pI simple want to avoid writing the same function over and over again for the different types of numbers that exist in Java.p

This is especially harmful for an app trying to sell you something, or sign you up for a new account. They might try to introduce a new feature where you can use the camera to take a profile picture or scan your credit card. Because the user didnt know about this feature, they might have previously denied camera access, but now want to enable it. After trying to reenable, they come back to your app to find they have to spend 5 minutes signing up  making a purchase, again After that, even I would probably give up.p

Negative 1357 pI have a VBA script which is used to search a range of specific dates out of a column with dates from AparSheet, and find the dates which is earlier than the current next month and latter then the next month of the source date, that is stored in the source worksheet WintelSheet, and copy the whole rows of data with dates in the range over the generated Sheet copy from AparSheet to GeneratedSheet. The whole process takes around 40 plus minutes, which is very timeconsuming and inefficient, though there are a lot data. At first, Im trying to use filter, but my VBA script didnt work with the filter code. So I just simply use the if statement. I wonder how to modify the code to make it run faster, I already clear the data at the end of the script and off the screenupdating at the start of the script.

Negative 1357 pI am trying to dig a bit deeper into memory allocation, addressing and I also run into the concept of stack alignment, and in general, memory alignment. I would like to understand if I got correctly all the concepts. My questions are all referred to nowdays computers and processors such as the one we have on our laptops. I wish to underline that I read lots of other questions on stackoverflow, and most of my actual knowledge come from them. p  pMy first doubts were related to the concept of memory word. The memory word define not only the registers and bus size, but also the basic memory unit e.g., 64 bit on 64bit arch, 32 bit on 32bit arch ecc. However, as far as I know, each address references exactly strong1 bytestrong of memory, regardless of the size of a memory word. So we might say that each byte has its own address. Butp  pstrong1strong Is it correct that the CPU is not able to access a single byte but it access the entire word in which that byte is contained Thus, if a specific byte is request for example, I access a the direct address of a emcharem, it access the entire word and makes some calculations to remove the other portion and return the exact bytep  pstrong2strong Is it then correct that the CPU can practically access ONLY memory word unit and that each memory word starts from a even address, multiple of the unit itselfp  pSo, for example, on a 64bit architecture the memory word are 8 bytes thus the example address 0x2710 10000 in base 10 would be the start of a memory word. If I try to access 0x2711 the CPU will access from 0x2710 to 0x2717 and then extract only the single byte. Correctp  pSecond. As, I said before, I run into the memory alignment. At start It created me some confusion. Please, help me to understand if I got it right. The problem essentially is related to performance or, in some cases, to SSE specific instructions that need 16bytes alignment. In the first case, for example, If on a 64bit arch a 8 bytes data e.g., a long int is stored across 2 memory words, the CPU needs 2 access instead of one. p  pstrong3strong So, take the following examplep  precode0x2710  ....  0x2711  ....  0x2712  ....  0x2713  ....  0x2714  data  0x2715  data  0x2716  data  0x2717  data  0x2718  data  0x2719  data  0x2720  data  0x2721  data  0x2722  ....  0x2723  ....  0x2724  ....  0x2725  ....  codepre  pIn this case memory is not aligned. Correct With alignment, CPU would have stored data only from 0x2710 or, if occupied until 0x2713, it would have inserted padding and then stored the 8bytes data from 0x2718. Rightp  pstrong4strong Thus, memory alignment essentially consists in storying multibyte data only starting from address which are multiple of the desired bytes unit usually, the memory word itself but also other custom units  e.g., using mpreferredstackboundaries on GCC. I said multibyte data because if the data is only onebyte it will always fit inside only a single word. Is all this correctp  pstrong5strong Memory alignment is applied by the compiler Thus, is it applied in the binary assembly code or it is applied in some way by the CPU when storing data And, isnt it a big waste of memory I mean, if it is always applied each multibyte data may imply also a padding I can be an enormous waste of memory spacep  pThats all Thanks, really thanks in advance p

Negative 1357 pI, like I see many others am struggling to come to terms with the fact that UITableView does not support multiple columns. Ive seen people mention that UICollectionView does this, but with the limited documentationexamples available I dont understand how this is best implemented.p  pIve just come from an Android build where this was simple, however Ive wasted several hours trying to come to grips with a solution to this trivial issue on iOS.p  pIm using Xamarin, and all I am trying to do is display a shopping cart.p  p4 columns name, qty, price, and a delete button.p  pIve been trying to implement 4 separate UITableViews and I have been playing with the sample UITableViewSource implementation found here a hrefhttpsdeveloper.xamarin.comrecipesioscontentcontrolstablespopulateatable relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.xamarin.comrecipesioscontentcontrolstablespopulateatablea. This however, relies on a string array for the values and just feels like a hack. Im not sure how I would modify this so that I could pass in a button which had its own click event.p  pCould someone please help explain how I would best go about getting around the trivial task of displaying a shopping cartp  pIm also unsure how best to set the headings Name, Qty, Price etc. Do I just add them as another rowp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 1357 pUser defined functions writen in Excel VBA seem to run much slower than functions simply written in the worksheet cells. Is there a way to run them faster As an example I have a very simple user defined functionp  precodeFunction myweekdaymydate As Double     myweekday  Weekdaymydate End Function codepre  pBasically it does the same thing as the built in weekday function.

Negative 1357 pIs there any way I can achieve the desired behaviour on rotation of the device, as illustrated in the following sketch the wavy thing is a widget.  Most likely this is something that would be controlled by the launcher, rather than controlled programmatically from any one app  if so, is there any launcher that allows thisp  pBasically the reason Im asking is because I want the emwidgetem to behave as illustrated the widget is what Im coding, even when the users device is set to rotate the home screen on device rotation.  Basically the only way I can see this working is if the grid layout is fixed relative to the physical screen, with the app icons just rotating within their box, and the widgets either updating their content for the new layout, or just keeping the previous content so that the content rotates with the screen.p  pFor updating of widget content, is there any way of detecting screen home screen rotation programmatically different to screen rotation, since the home screen may not rotate  This is relevant to me even for the what I get scenario, because the aspect ratio of the widget seems to change when the home screen is rotated, and I need to detect this and update the widget content to fit better.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comWvlMP.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWvlMP.png altBehaviour of homescreen on rotationap  pdfddp

Negative 1357 pI am working on a project that uses data to generate a Highcharts plot. Basically, its just an xy lineseries plot, but the chart is using the wrong data for the xaxis. I am trying to figure out why this is occuring. The snippet of code that I have is as followsp  precodevar data  this.costAnalyzerService.OpenCostWindowDataToSend, CurrentTrain, CustId var obj  Jsondata, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet return obj codepre  pThe data variable is of type codeSystems.Collections.Generic.ListltSystem.Tupleltint, double, doublegtgtcodep  pBasically, all the data in this variable is correct. The int should be my xaxis, and the two doubles are my two sets of line series data. I have reason to believe that the code that is generating the plot is not using the int as the xaxis. Rather, it is simply using 1,2,3...,N points as the xaxis numbers. p  pHow can I peek into this JSON object to see what is going on and what it is returning. If I step through the code past this point, the chart simply generates and the execution of the application finishes. There are no more step points to debug after this point. Literally, the function returns the JSON object and finishes. It doesnt even return to the calling function, so far as I can tell. p  pHere is the COMPLETE method that I am working withp  precode public JsonResult PlotCostAnalyzerChartdouble acidPrice  0.0,

Negative 1357 pIm trying to integrate an openLayers Javascript component to ADF aplication. Thats because I have done the integration of an esri component with another applications and I know about it a little more than other solutions.p  pWell here you get my visualization of the solution I have planed to use an inlineframe of ADF to show, manipulate and handle events of the map. Ive already begun to do it, but theres  several considerations... p  pFor instance, the ids of the html elements, are automatically created, Ive read that I can use AdfUIComponent.findComponentrelativeID to get the adf component, but it doesnt work for me. Well I had even used the AdfPage.PAGE.findComponentByAbsoluteId, but with that solution, the instantiated Adf Inlineframe Object, has not a initialized getPeer.getDomNode until the user interacts with the map.p  pWell to solve the IDs problem, Im just using the absolute autogenerated ID and geting the HTML element likep  precodedocument.getElementByIdjidjsp8375957533mapFrame codepre  pId love to know how to get the html component without the absolute ID.

Negative 1357 pWhat disadvantages or advantages are there to setting different values for a send and receive buffer on opposite sides of a connection It seems to make the most sense and the norm to keep these values the same. But if one side say the sender side has the resources to double their buffer size, what implications could this havep  pI guess a related question is, what disadvantages are there to setting a largerthanrequired buffer size From what Ive read, it sounds like you could potentially overflow the receive buffer if your send buffer is larger. Additionally, it seems like there may not be a need to increase buffer sizes as long as your applications are keeping up with the load and can handle maxsize messages. It doesnt necessarily mean you could handle more data throughput because you are still limited by the opposite endpoint. Is this correctp  pThe specific kernel settings in question are as followsp  precodenet.core.wmemmax net.core.rmemmax codepre
Negative 1357 pThis is a weird one. I have several tabs in my first app, each with a few different views. And yes, the last tab to be coded is causing me grief.  p  pWhen using the desktop browser there is absolutely no problems  no broken JS, the animations are smooth, everything looks great, as I transition from View 1 to View 2 in tab Dashboard, and then from View 2 to View 3.p  pWhen I build the app, and try on my iPhone 5, the transition between Views 1 and 2 is either completely broken stops half way, or has a mini seizure forwards and back, then forwards again before landing on View 2. The same then candoes happen between Views 2 and Views 3.

For historical reasons we collect a bunch of server info through Windows server Forwarded Event solution. Forwarded Events is not easy to collect from a collector computer as logparser and other solutions hardly access it. So I decided to collect and uplaod it with Powershell.p  pThe script runs every 60 minutes as scheduled job, collects events backward for 65 minutes.p  pThe script runs fine. But from time to time it does skips 12 lines. I do not understand why. It does not skips a whole session  but for example if in a 65 minute interval there are 5 events, it uploads 4. Next time it runns fluently. Next time it again skips from 10 event 2 randomly.p  pI would like to know why. But I do not understand the reason AND I have no clue how could I log the actual insert command to fix it, or create other error handling.p  pAs you can see I implemented transaction as well  hopefully not wrongly, and transaction gives an ok as well.p  pHave no Idea how to find the reason andor source of error.p
