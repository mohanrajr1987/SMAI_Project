Positive 64956 pI am trying to pass the hour and minute from an EditText string into a calendar object and then put the hour and minute into a Bundle to be to set to a TimePickerFragment.  The string is from a previously selected time that the user enters on the EditText line.  I split the string into hour and minute parts using Integer.parseInt.  When I run, I get Invalid int 07PM [which are the minutes from 507 PM for example].  Additional error lines say at java.lang.Integer.invalidInt at java.lang.Integer.parse at java.lang.Integer.parseInt.  Is the parse not working because the PM is being included in the split  Any other ideas on what is causing the problemp  pActivity filep  precode  Calendar tcal  Calendar.getInstance    String timeStr  gEditText.getText.toString.replace ,     String[]timeParts  timeStr.split               tcal.setCalendar.HOUR, Integer.parseInttimeParts[0]               tcal.setCalendar.MINUTE, Integer.parseInttimeParts[1]               Bundle timebundle  new Bundle               timebundle.putInthour, tcal.getCalendar.HOUR               timebundle.putIntminute, tcal.getCalendar.MINUTE  codepre  pTimePicker filep  precodepublic class TimePickerFragment extends DialogFragment implements TimePickerDialog.OnTimeSetListener  public Dialog onCreateDialogBundle savedInstanceState  if getArguments  null      cal  Calendar.getInstance     hour  getArguments.getInthour     minute  getArguments.getIntminute     cal.setCalendar.HOUR, Calendar.MINUTE  TimePickerDialog dialog  new TimePickerDialoggetActivity, this , hour, minute, false dialog.setTitleSelect a Due Time return dialog     public void onTimeSetTimePicker view, int hourOfDay, int minute  txtTime  EditText getActivity.getWindow.getDecorView.getRootView.findViewByIdR.id.GEditText String AMPM    Calendar displaytime  Calendar.getInstance displaytime.setCalendar.HOUROFDAY, hourOfDay displaytime.setCalendar.MINUTE, minute  if displaytime.getCalendar.AMPM  Calendar.AM     AMPM  AM  else if displaytime.getCalendar.AMPM  Calendar.PM     AMPM  PM  String minuteString if minute lt 10     minuteString  0  minute else     minuteString    minute  String hours  displaytime.getCalendar.HOUR 0  12     displaytime.getCalendar.HOUR   txtTime.setTexthours    minuteString     AMPM     txtTime.setSelectiontxtTime.getText.length  codepre

Positive 64956 pOn a MultiAutoCompleteTextView in android I am able to add entries and parse them just fine. After auto completing the most recent item, when I press backspace it will delete all the characters before I autocompleted the item. Great. Now my problem is when I have multiple entries already autocompleted. I want to be able to delete each entry with a single backspace rather than deleting each character individually. I have tried using a TextWatcher but couldnt really get that to go anywhere. Is there a way I could tokenize each entry as its own entity rather than appending it to a string like google hangouts and facebook do. Note this isnt a requirement, just a thought of how i could do it. Thanks for any help Ill post here if I find out more.p

Positive 64956 pI am making an android app, everything works really well, except if freezes does not respond when I input text Anywhere in the Activity.p  pI am not getting a crash so i dont have a logcat error, but rather an unresponsive app as soon as I try to input text in any field EditText or SearchView in my entire application even if it is an AlertBuilder Dialog. p  pUPDATE SOLVEDp  pAfter quite a while and searching every thread on the internet, I finally figured it out.

Negative 64956 pI am automating a document with html and javascript through MS Notepad.  So far, I have lots of text, a few textboxes, and a button, which will execute a javascript function after a number is entered into one of the textboxes.  This document is only partially completed however, I noticed that  after I add entries into my textboxes and then press the button, all of my entries erase.  I believe this is a postback issue of some sort however, I thought using an onlick event with javascript would not execute a serverside command.  Also, my document is all clientside code.  Basically, it is just text, html, and, currently, one JS function.p  pAs a reiteration, would anyone know why my textbox entries erase after a buttons onclick event executes, and how to stop this from happening  Additionally, the onclick event executes the JS function, which is an if statement that adds more text to the document.p  pThank you,p  pDFM p

Negative 64956 pFor some reason, after using an IpcChannel and shutting it down, sometimes the namedpipe stays open, with a thread waiting on it.  I cannot make this happen on demand in a debug environment, but it happens 5 to 10 times per day in our production environment.  The bad effect this is having is that it is stopping me from unloading the appdomain as there is a thread waiting infinitely on the named pipe in a native method...no frame on the callstack is in my code  its an internal .net thread.  If I fire up process explorer and find the named pipe handle that was left open and forcefully close it then it all becomes happy again, the appdomain unloads fine.

Negative 64956 pI crafted a Bash prompt that, When the working directory is a Git repository, displays the name of the current repository. Besides, it contains the current ongoing task and the time spent doing it from a homebrew timekeeping tool. This, of course, means that just displaying the prompt means running two processes.p  pThis has the drawback that if the system is thrashing for whatever reason, it takes forever to get a prompt to do that necessary codekillallcode to save the system, as just loading the codegitcode binary is too much to ask of the system in such a state.p  pSo, right now, the prompt is disabled by default, and only enabled on demand, but this is not that comfortable. It would be nicer to detect the load in code.bashrccode, and only enable the prompt if the system is running fine i.e. with acceptable disk latency.p  pIn such situations, CPU is fairly cheap, only the disk is expensive. So I need a way that detects thrashing without depending on external utilities.p  pHint codeproccode might have something useful. E.g. codeprocloadavgcode would solve my problem if it were the CPU that causes the bottlenecks, not the disk.p

Negative 64956 pWere using a custom data access layer to read our domain objects customers, orders, etc from a database. This data access layer does not support paging or sorting.p  pWe want to publish parts of the data for instance customers to a Silverlight client, using WCF RIA Services.

I assume RIA cant do any form of serverside paging in this scenario  We will always read all customers when the function is called.p  pMy questions arep  pWill RIA cache the customer list in the client and call GetCustomers only once, or will it execute the operation every time a user moves to the next page in the data grid p  pIn my scenario, the operation may take 5 seconds to execute which would be acceptable if its done once, but not if it takes 5 seconds every time the user wants to move to a new page in the data grid.p  pIs there some good solutionpatternmethod to use when using RIA to access a legacy data access layer and you want to use pagingp

Negative 64956 pIs checking for key existence in HashMap always necessaryp  pI have a HashMap with say a 1000 entries and I am looking at improving the efficiency. If the HashMap is being accessed very frequently, then checking for the key existence at every access will lead to a large overhead. Instead if the key is not present and hence an exception occurs, I can catch the exception. when I know that this will happen rarely. This will reduce accesses to the HashMap by half.p  pThis might not be a good programming practice, but it will help me reduce the number of accesses.

Negative 64956 pI have a DTS package, which after running daily with no problems for a couple of years, has started to play up. Originally it was inserting data into a table which would then fire an insert trigger. The trigger used [inserted] to update three columns in the table. Usually, it was updating about 500,000 rows of inserted data.p  pWhen the problem started, the update statement inside the trigger was taking hours to run and usually had to be cancelled. Disabling the trigger allowed the DTS to run as normal. Running the UPDATE statement in a regular query window didnt cause any problems  it ran in less than 10 seconds.p  pTo get around the problem, another task was added to the DTS to run the UPDATE after the INSERT in place of the trigger. This worked OK for a while, but the separate UPDATE task has now started to exhibit the same problem that the trigger had. The UPDATE still runs as expected if done in a regular query window.p  pThe DTS package was created in SQL 2000 and is running on SQL 2005 Enterprise x64.p  pIm at a bit of a loss to try and figure this one out. Any ideasp

Negative 64956 pI ran into some locking issue in my application, in which contains several classes like belowp  precodepublic interface AppClient      void hello   public class Client implements AppClient      public synchronized static AppClient getInstance          return instance           public void hello          System.out.printlnHello Client           private final static class InnerClient implements AppClient          public void hello              System.out.printlnHello InnerClient                   private static AppClient instance      static          instance  new InnerClient         doSomethingThatWillCallClientGetInstanceSeveralTimes        public class Application      new Thread          AppClient c  Client.getInstance         c.hello     .start     new Thread          AppClient c  Client.getInstance         c.hello     .start      ...     new Thread          AppClient c  Client.getInstance         c.hello     .start  codepre  pIn the doSomethingThatWillCallClientGetInstanceSeveralTimes method, it will do quite a lot initialization work involving many classes and circularly call Client.getInstance static method several times during the initialization I understand this is not good, however, this is a legacy code base which lasts for 20 years. p  pHere is my problemp  p1 I thought before the class Client initialization completes, only the first thread that triggers the class Client initialization can access Client.getInstance method because JVM will synchronize on the Client.class object before the class initialization completes. I read the JLS on related topic and came to this conclusion section 12.4.2, Detailed Initialization Procedure, a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksjlsthirdeditionhtmlexecution.html relnofollowhttpjava.sun.comdocsbooksjlsthirdeditionhtmlexecution.htmla.p  p2 However, it was not the behavior as I saw in my real environment. For example, there are three threads calling Client.getInstance, thread1 triggers the Client.class initialization, and calls Client.getInstance in doSomethingThatWillCallClientGetInstanceSeveralTimes method several times. And before the completion of doSomethingThatWillCallClientGetInstanceSeveralTimes method, thread2 acquires the lock of Client.class object how is that possible but it did happen, and enters into Client.getInstance method because this method is a static synchronized method. For some reason, thread2 cannot return the instance I guess it is waiting for Client.class completes its initialization. At the same time, thread1 cannot proceed because it still needs to call Client.getInstance in doSomethingThatWillCallClientGetInstanceSeveralTimes and cannot acquire the lock since it is owned by thread2. Threaddump tells me that thread2 is in RUNNABLE state, and thread1 is in BLOCKED state waiting for the lock owned by thread2.p  pI can only reproduce this behavior in 64 bit Java 6u23 JVM in Windows and cannot reproduce it a 32 bit Java 6 JVM  Windows environment. Can someone tell me what am I missing here Is this kind of code doomed to give rise to such locking, if yes, how come Is my understanding on JLS for this part is incorrect Or it is a JVM issue Any help is appreciated. Thanks.p
Negative 64956 pIve written a ListActivity that has a custom list adapter.  The list is being updated from a ContentProvider when onCreate is run.  I also have a service that gets started when I run the app and it first updates the ContentProvider, then sends a Broadcast that the content has been updated.br   My ListActivity recieves the broadcast and tries to update my ListView.  My problem is, Im getting intermittent errors about the ListView adapter data changing without the ListView being notified.  I call the notifyDataSetChanged method on my list adapter right after I update it.  What it seems like is happening is the list is still in the process of being updated after first call in onCreate when it recieves the broadcast from the service to update, so it tries to update my ListView before its finished updating from its first run.  Does this make sense  Here is some of my code.p  pNOTE The service is working properly, it gets new data and updates my ContentProvider, and I do get the broadcast in my activity when it is updated.p  precodeOverride public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     ctx  this     getPrefs     setContentViewR.layout.main       Setup preference listener     preferences  PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferencesthis     preferences.registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListenerlistener        Setup report list adapter     ListView nzbLv  ListView findViewByIdR.id.reportlist     nzbla  new NZBReportListAdaptorctx     getReports     nzbla.setListItemsreportlist                 nzbLv.setAdapternzbla              Broadcast receiver to get notification from NZBService to update ReportList     registerReceiverreceiver,             new IntentFilterNZBService.BROADCASTACTION      startServicenew Intentctx, NZBService.class codepre  pp  precodeOverride public void onResume      super.onResume     timerHandler.resume       new updateSabQueue.execute     updateList   Override public void onPause      super.onPause     timerHandler.pause     unregisterReceiverreceiver    private BroadcastReceiver receiver  new BroadcastReceiver      public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent          Toast.makeTextctx, NZBService broadcast recieved, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show         updateReportList         private void updateReportList      new updateReportList.execute     private class updateReportList extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Booleangt        nonJavadoc       see android.os.AsyncTaskonPreExecute       Show progress dialog           protected void onPreExecute             nonJavadoc       see android.os.AsyncTaskdoInBackgroundParams[]       Get new articles from the internet           protected Boolean doInBackgroundVoid...unused          getReports         return true                  On post execute.

Negative 64956 pI recently upgraded to 1.5, and functions likep  precodefunction showDataid    .geturlgetdata, id  id, functiondata   dialogData.htmldata  dialogData.dialogwidth 500, modal true, zIndex22000  , json  codepre  pno longer work with the addition of 1.5.p  pLooking at firebug, the correct data is returned, but the function breaks after entering the callback. Everything simply stops.p  pHow can I fix this I read about the changes to Ajax call in 1.5, but I have over a thousand such calls through my project  I cannot even begin to think about hunting them all down and changing them, let alone bug testing it all.p  pEdit Oddly enough, if I put text json instead of json for dataType, it works. I dont think going through all my code and changing that is a viable option...p  pEdit 2 Instead of returning jsonencodestring, I tried returning jsonencodearraystring  string, and then I did element.htmldata.string. This did not work either, and the JSON data I got with this call was valid on jsonlint.comp  pEdit 3 Tried setting headers prior to the jsonencode output, didnt work. So far the only solution has been setting the datatype to text json.p

Negative 64956 pI need to communicate a Guid that was generated in .NET to a Java application. I use codeGuid.ToByteArraycode to store it on disk as a codebyte[]code, then read it into Java and convert it to a UUID. For this purpose I copied the implementation of the private constructor of UUID that takes a codebyte[]codep  precodeprivate UUIDbyte[] data      long msb  0     long lsb  0     assert data.length  16     for int i0 ilt8 i         msb  msb ltlt 8  data[i] amp 0xff     for int i8 ilt16 i         lsb  lsb ltlt 8  data[i] amp 0xff     this.mostSigBits  msb     this.leastSigBits  lsb  codepre  pHowever, when I inspect the UUID using codetoStringcode, the Java UUID is different from the .NET Guid.p  pFor example, the .NET Guidp  precode888794c265ce4de1aa1575a11342bc63 codepre  pturns into the Java UUIDp  precodec2948788ce65e14daa1575a11342bc63 codepre  pIt seems that the byte ordering of the first three groups is reversed, while the ordering in the last two groups is the same.p  pSince I would expect the codetoStringcode of both the Guid and the UUID to yield the same result, does anyone know how I should correctly read the .NET Guid into a Java UUIDp  pstrongEditstrong To clarify, the implementation is not my own. It is the private constructor of the codejava.util.UUIcodeD class that takes a codebyte[]code, which I copied to use for the purpose of reading a byte[] from disk into a UUID.p  pI do not want to use strings to store the Guids as Im storing a lot of them and it seems like a waste of space.p  pRussell Troywests link at least clarifies why the first couple of groups of the Guid come out reversed, while the second half stays in the same order. The question is, can I depend on .NET strongalwaysstrong generating these bytes in the same orderp

Negative 64956 pIm working with a codeSystem.Windows.Forms.Panelcode that has xy data rendered in it as primitive graphics.p  pThis panel is placed directly within another codeSystem.Windows.Forms.Panelcode that has the codeAutoScrollcode property set to codeTruecode.  As a not unexpected result, the scrollbars appear when I zoom in with the contained panel.p  pA side effect of this is that when the horizontal scroll bar appears, it appears within graph area, which reduces the height of the viewable area of the graph, which causes the vertical scrollbar to appear.  Again, this is probably what its supposed to do.  So, I get both scrollbars, even when I mean to stretch the graph out only in the x direction.p  pHaving the bottom part of the vertical data just out of reach in the client area and needing to scroll vertically to get there all the time is annoying to my customers.  It seems that the way to fix this is to have the scrollbars appear emoutsideem of the viewable area so that the viewable area is not changed when the scrollbars appear.p  pIs there an easy way to do this  Thanks as always.p  pstrongEditstrong  Im not the original author of this code, and putting in a newer chart component like codeSystem.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.Chartcode is a better longterm solution, but Im on a small time crunch here for now.p

Negative 64956 pwhat i have until now is a customized gallery activity in which i inflate layouts instead of images to create a swipable ui quite similar to the android homescreen. In my application this represents a catalogue of descriptions and pictures of artworks the user can browse through by swiping.br Because gallery consumes all touchevents, i made my own subclass of the gallery class to allow scrollviews to function.br Im now trying to add functionality to some buttons in the inflated layouts. I think here again is the problem that the gallery consumes the touchevents, because when setting a .setOnClickListener on the inflated View in the customized baseAdapters getView method nothing happens.

Negative 64956 pIve started migrating a simple site to Jekyll. I have a set of templates that everything inherits from, so that all I have to do is fill in the actual content. However, in moving the content over, I find that some of it needs to modify the tags previously specified by the template. p  pFor example, I have a main template, which specifies everything up to and including the opening codeltbodygtcode tag. One of my sites pages uses a bit of JavaScript to modify an html5 canvas, and so its opening tag has to be something like codeltbody onloadstartDrawinggtcode. Now, it seems silly to have an entirely separate template whose only change is this single tag, but equally silly to remove this tag from the template and have every page manually specify the opening codeltbodygtcode tag. What is the right way to go about solving thisp

Negative 64956 pI have a setup where I have a grid of elements and when I rollover each element a popup appears like an advanced tooltip. I first check if the popup needs to follow the moused over elements mouse position, if so I use a mousemove event. I first stopObserving in case there was one set before, then I start observing. Do I really need to do this or is prototype smart enough to not to add duplicate events on the same element. p  precode showfunctionparam       ifthis.isFollow         param.target.stopObservingmousemove, this.onMouseMove         param.target.observemousemove, this.onMouseMove        ,  param.target is the element that is being rolled over. I pass this in to my show method to then find its x and y position.   onMouseMovefunctionevent     var xPos  Event.pointerXevent     var yPos  Event.pointerYevent     self.popup.setStyleleft xPos  10  px, topyPos  10  px   codepre  pSecond question. When I move my mouse across the elements really fast my popup that is following the  mouse sometimes lags and the mouse goes over the popup obstructing the mouseover event on the element below it. I presume this is the nature of the mousemove as its not rendering fast enough. Should I be using setTimeout or something like that instead of mousemove, to prevent this lag. p

Negative 64956 pIm in the process of making an Android 3 app that has a tabbased navigation. Being quite new to Android I searched for tab tutorials and found a few different approaches, out of which an implementation based on Fragments  ActionBar seemed to be the best. I followed these tutorialsp  pa hrefhttpwww.abelski.comcoursesandroid3uiactionbar.pdfhttpwww.abelski.comcoursesandroid3uiactionbar.pdfa the last few slides and a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvgMu8XhxUBl8httpwww.youtube.comwatchvgMu8XhxUBl8a same lesson in video formatp  p...and got to the point where the tabs show up, I can switch between them OK, and simple TextViews inside them show up fine. p  pNow, problems arise when I want one of the tabs to have a spinner widget that is defined in the fragments XML file and populate it with items that are defined in the strings.xml file. When I try to access the spinner with emgetViewByIdem from the emonCreateem method I always get a null value as a result. p  pAs I understand it, to fix this I need to somehow declare the XML of the fragment similarly like main layout has been done with emsetContentViewR.layout.mainem so that emgetViewByIdem knows where to look for the spinner Eclipses autocomplete finds it already though. However, Im at complete loss how to do this, since none of the tutorials tackled the scenario where you want to modify the XMLbased Fragments contents inside the code.p  pstrongThe main.xml looks like thisstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparentgt   ltLinearLayout androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidididfragmentplaceholdergtltLinearLayoutgt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pstrongtab1fragment.xml like thisstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid               androidorientationvertical                androidlayoutwidthfillparent                androidlayoutheightfillparentgt      ltSpinner androidididspinner1               androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent               androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pstrongand onCreate method like thisstrongp  precodepublic void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.main      ActionBar ab  getActionBar     ab.setNavigationModeActionBar.NAVIGATIONMODETABS      ActionBar.Tab newAuditTab  ab.newTab.setTextR.string.tabheadernewaudit     Fragment newAuditFrag  new FragmentTabNewAudit     newAuditTab.setTabListenernew TabListenernewAuditFrag     ab.addTabnewAuditTab      and the same for other tabs      Spinner spinner  Spinner findViewByIdR.id.spinner1  this returns null     ArrayAdapterltCharSequencegt adapter  ArrayAdapter.createFromResource             this, R.array.cellarray, android.R.layout.simplespinneritem cellarray is defined in strings.xml       adapter.setDropDownViewResourceandroid.R.layout.simplespinnerdropdownitem     spinner.setAdapteradapter     spinner.setOnItemSelectedListenernew MyOnItemSelectedListener    codepre  pAccessing the views that are defined in main.xml via R.id works fine, so in this case the problem isnt related to Eclipses autoimporting of the R class, I think.p  pI guess I could define the spinner programmatically to get around the issue, but there is probably a more elegant solution to this, I hope.

Negative 64956 pI need your opinion in this situation. Ill try to explain the scenario. I have a Windows service that stores data in an Oracle database periodically. The table where this data is being stored is partitioned by date IntervalDate Range Partitioning. The database also has a dbmsscheduler job that, among other operations, truncates and drops older partitions. p  pThis approach has been working for some time, but recently I had an a hrefhttpora00054.oracode.com relnofollowORA00054a error. After some investigation, the error was reproduced with the following stepsp  ol liOpen one sqlplus session, disable autocommit, and insert data in the partitioned table, emwithout committingem the changesli liOpen another sqlplus session and truncatedrop an old partition DDL operations are automatically committed, if Im not mistaken. We will then get the ORA00054 error.li ol  pThere are some constraints worthy to be mentionedp  ul liI dont have DBA access to the databaseli liThis is a legacy application and a complete refactoring isnt feasibleli ul  pSo, in your opinion, is there any way of dropping these old partitions, without the risk of running into an ORA00054 error and without the intervention of the DBA I can just delete the data, but the number of empty partitions will grow everyday.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

I was surprised by this but it seems to be true.  Can anyone tell me if Im overlooking something here because Ive seen several people claim using the GetXXX methods perform better.  I timed this as a whole and also timed individual retrieve operations.  Did I really just debunk a mythp  pEDIT After testing some more I found a couple things out.  p  p1st  It is marginally faster about 8 for the tests I ran to use a get method that returns a value into a strongly typed variable and I tested this without all the superfluous code above so there was no dispatching or anything like that... just apples to apples.p  pHowever, note that I am using the GetSqlXXX functions rather than the GetXXX functions.  This is because the latter cannot be used for null values.  However, the former returns types like SqlInt32 rather than int.  My fields are not SqlXXX though, they are simple nullable types like int.  I think this is often going to be the case for most people which means that you dont really get the speed increase of the typed methods unless you want to start working with SqlTypes throughout your code.p  pSecondly, I noticed that retrieving null values seems to be slower than you would expect in general... but thats just my opinion of course.p  pEDIT 2 Just for Doug McClean and TheEvilPenguin I timed just the branching as followsp  precode        Stopwatch sw  new Stopwatch         long time  0          while dr.Read                      var obj  new O             obj.Initializing  true               sw.Restart                         foreach var p in obj.Properties                              if p.Type  System.Nullable1[System.Int16] continue                 else if p.Type  System.Nullable1[System.Int32] continue                 else if p.Type  System.Nullable1[System.Decimal] continue                 else if p.Type  System.Nullable1[System.Boolean] continue                 else if p.Type  System.String continue                          time  sw.ElapsedTicks                  sw.Stop         MessageBox.Showtime.ToString codepre  pI had to leave a couple of lines not specific to the branching in there, but you can see that I am only adding up time around the branching.  At first I did it in milliseconds and the result for about 60k records was 1.  Obviously each cycle is less than a millisecond so I switched to ticks and the result was 466472 which is less than 1 half of 1 millisecond unless I got my decimal places mixed up... someone please correct me if Im off there.  So how expensive is branching Not.p  pActually those results do seem awfully small so someone please correct me if I made a mistake in my test, but either way branching is one of the cheapest things you can do.p

after forwarding to the codetest.jspcode there are requests for codeerror.jspcode Requesting codeerror.jspcode, codesupportErrorcode works as expected  codeWEBINFpagestest.jspcode is rendered and the request is completed.p  pEDIT If codeerror.jspcode forwards directly to codeWEBINFpagestestcode there wont be any loop.

Negative 64956 pI created a GWT marquee which works with a loop that moves the text a couple of pxs ahead every few miliseconds. Did not use the  element because its not compliant and frowned upon. Did not use CSS3HTML5 because IE does not yet support it.p  pNow I also added a mouseListener to capture the mouseover and mouseOut events, so that when the mouse is over the marquee, the scrolling pauses.p  pEverything works perfectly in chrome, Firefox, safari etc. But NOT IE Thank you, MSFTp  pWhen I move the mouse in, the marquee pauses as expected, but when I move the mouse out, sometimes not consistently  especially if I move the mouse really quickly, the marquee doesnt resume scrolling until half a second or a second later. It looks like its taking IE that much time to realize the mouse has left the marquee and trigger an event.p  pThere are quite a few posts on StackOverflow about IE not capturing the MouseOut event at all, but thats not the same as my experience. It seems like the event is always captured eventually, just with a 0.51.5 second delay many of the times.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas what might be the problemp  pThank youp

Ive get that this one can appear when performing with codejava.net.URLConnectioncode requesting some data from the Internet but still dont know about its any possible reasons to look for to investigate my particular problem. So my questions are strongwhat are possible reasons of this message and can this affect applications normal run Finally, what is the cache and can I control it somehowstrongp  pstrongIn detailstrongp  pIt will be too difficult and unnecessary to post big code snippets so Ill try to describe the problem as simplier as possible.p  pI am building an applet based on a hrefhttpworldwind.arc.nasa.govjava relnofollowNASA WorldWinda and facing a very strange behavior when requesting tiled image layers calling corresponding applets method from JavaScript. Tiled image layer is a layer that can overlay 3D Earth and consisting of sets of fixedsize pictures tiles which are to be requested separately during layers loading suppose, layer is something like a puzzle of tiles . Thats why each tiles request has its own thread.p  pInitially I had an a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.4.2docsapijavasecurityAccessControlException.html relnofollowAccessControllerExceptiona due to each tile request thread had no permissions to make crossdomain requests and readsave load results to local file cache. This problem has been solved by wrapping tile requests actual code byp  precodeAccessController.doPrivilegednew PrivilegedAction       Override     public Object run            Requesting tile and performing with the result...          ...       codepre  pAs the result, I see that tiles are loaded and stored in local file cache directory. But I still dont see the layer on the Earth. The fact is that I get the following network messages in Java consolep  precodenetwork Cache entry not found [url httpcaches.scanex.rugetTile.cgiTBMNG012004ampL0ampX4ampY1, version null] network Connecting httpcaches.scanex.rugetTile.cgiTBMNG012004ampL0ampX4ampY1 with proxyHTTP  192.168.4.108080 codepre  pI was able to find a place in the code when these messages appear  when getting HTTP response codep  precodeHttpURLConnection htpc  HttpURLConnectionfconnection responseCode  htpc.getResponseCode codepre  pThen, I found out that codejava.net.URLcode instance provided for codeURLConnectioncode and other preparations are also made in another thread.

But Im still confused by codeCache entry not foundcode messages cause they are left in Java console and appear for each requested tile.

Negative 64956 pIve created my app using all the neccessary things to support different screen sizesdensities relative layouts, dip etc.p  pIve created all the neccessary layout files ldpi,mdpi etc and images for this support.p  pIve tested the app on all the available emulator skins using Eclipse, and they all appear like the should. I then tested this on a real device Samsung Galaxy SII and it looked great. Then I tested it on a Galaxy Tab 7 and the layouts were a bit wrong, and the text sizes were wrong too, making it look really bad on the tablet.p  pIm really confused by this, because it was tested using all of the emulator skins this includes a 7 screen skin. I then created a custom AVD  1024X600, 240 density, to match the exact specs of the galaxy tablet. This again looked as it should on the emulator, but the real device shows differently.p  pAny thoughts why this is Shouldnt an emulator with the same specs of a real device look the same as the devicep  pThanksp

Negative 64956 pI have 3 projects  silverlight app A and 2 silverlight class libraries B,C. My serialization logic is in project C, Method CallSer. If the routine from B calls CallSer, everything works fine. But if routine from C calls CallSer, it gives the below error. I have tried setting Copy Local property but its not helped I am seeing the assemblies getting copied to the debug folder when Copy Local  True. This seems to be surprising, any one has ideas on how to resolve this Thanks.p  blockquote   pSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException Could not load file or assembly   System.Xml, Version5.0.5.0, Cultureneutral,   PublicKeyToken7cec85d7bea7798e or one of its dependencies. The   system cannot find the file specified. File name System.Xml,   Version5.0.5.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken7cec85d7bea7798ep blockquote  pUpdate I did a little more analysis and found the call to CallSer is actually from another .NET class library D. So call stack shows is D  C  CallSer. I am not sure what difference this can make as long as I have codeSystem.Xml.Serializationcode reference to C. Also, I dont see codeSystem.Xml.Serializationcode listed in Add Reference option for D Why is that sop  pUpdate Looks like XmlSerializer is getting confused as to which reference to load.Thats because Silverlight has XmlSerializer defined inside System.Xml.Serialization.dll assembly and .NET framework has it in System.Xml.dll. My project D has reference to System.Xml and C has System.Xml and System.Xml.Serialization. How do I make sure C always references Silverlight version of dllsp

Negative 64956 pI have this website where I have implemented a pretty simple messaging system between 2 users in PHP using CakePHP to be more accurate.p  pIt all works fine, one user sends a message and the other user receives it. The only problem is that the second user has to refresh the page to see the message.p  pIs there any way I can tell the second users browser to refresh when the first user sends a message Messages are stored in a MySQL database. When a user goes to the messaging page, I show all the messages from last to first that belong to him, pulling them from the database.p  pThe easy way would be to make some javascript function that periodically refreshes the page, but thats not the best solution, and can be annoying for the user. Ideally, the page should refresh when the user receives a new message...p  pAnother way Ive been thinking about is to make an AJAX call to a function, passing somehow the datetime of the last received message when the user entered the page, which then checks for a newer message, and if true, refreshes the page. This wouldnt be bad if I managed to make it work, but still would imply other problems in this page with other stuff thats going on.p  pIs there any other way to do thisp

Negative 64956 pthe following splitter method is designed to return a IntLinkedBag array of two separate linked lists.

But If I do so, Im able to set the scroll position to 2000  600  1  1401. What does position 1401 mean if 1400 should display the bottom If MaxScrollPos did equal MaxRangeValue  PageSize, everything will work perfectly.

Negative 64956 pIn my code Im adopting a design strategy which is similar to some standard library algorithms in that the exact behavior can be customized by a function object.

I would have imagined that it was instead possible to have only one implementation, and provide a default comparator using operatorlt  as a default template parameter.p  pWhat is the rational behind two separate versions Would my suggestion make the interface more complex in some way Or result in confusing error messages when the object does not provide operatorlt  Or maybe it just doesnt workp  pThanks,p  pDavidp

But none of my tries had got a functional activity.p  pI explore the web since 4 or 5 hours, seeking for something approaching the solution Im looking for. Is someone has a little idea of how two make it possiblep  pThanks by advance for your timep  pstrongEditstrong Here is a mounting of what this can render. The tabs manage two or more fragments, and in one of the fragments tab, there are two other fragments.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC8CZo.png altenter image description herep
Negative 64956 pSo Ive got a special case set of cubic splines, whose 2d control points will always result in a curve that will never cross itself in the emxem axis.  That is, the curves look like they could be a simple polynomial function such that emyemIfIemxem.  I want to efficiently create an array of emyem coordinates along the spline that correspond to evenlyspaced x coordinates running the length of the spline segment.  p  pI want to efficiently find the y coordinates along the spline where, for instance, emxem0.0, emxem0.1, emxem0.2, etc., or approached another way, effectively transform the emfsubx,ysubemItI style function into an emfemIxI function.p  pIm currently using a 4x4 constant matrix and four 2d control points to describe the spline, using matrix constants for either Hermite or CatmullRom splines, and plugging them into a cubic function of emtem going from 0 to 1.p  pGiven the matrix and the control points, whats the best way to obtain these y values over the x axisp  pEDIT I should add that an approximation good enough to draw is sufficient.p
Negative 64956 pIve been reading a lot about password storing, hashing, salting, peppering, MAC, etc because Im about to make a new website and security its really important to me, however there are some reasons why Im considering not using Google Authentication or Facebook, OpenID or any other which are not relevant right now, but it brings me to this point.p  pIm new to Google App Engine, this is going to be my first project on it, and Im a little confused about the Instance Hours and how it no longer has CPU time but the aforementioned quota. Even worst, I havent been able to understand what is the Instance Hours Free Quota.p  pHeres why Im worried about the quotas and what does that has anything to do with my security concerns One recommendation Ive read everywhere is to make multiple iterations and hash the password several times, because that would make and attacker spend much much much more time I dont have numbers, but they are everywhere on a hrefhttpsecurity.stackexchange.comhttpsecurity.stackexchange.coma.p  pMultiple iterations have direct impact on CPU time, and if GAE had a CPU time quota I think making 1000 iterations every time a user logs in could be a problem, however if what they count is Instance Hours from the moment the request is done to up to fifteen minutes later and as read on a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocsquotashles relnofollowGAE quota docsa isp  blockquote   pIn general, instance usage is billed on an hourly basis based on the   instances uptime. Billing begins when the instance starts and ends   fifteen minutes after the instance shuts down. You will be billed only   for idle instances up to the number of maximum idle instances set in   the Performance Settings tab of the Admin Console. Runtime overhead is   counted against the instance memory.p blockquote  pthen it means that if my users log in hash 1000 times, then they continue to use the site, the Instance Hours will continue to sum until all of them leave the page  15 minutes If this is true, then making it iterate 1000 times wouldnt have a significant impact on my quota, other than the extra time it takes for the user to log in, but Im aware of that and its a price Im willing to pay.p  pThe number of iterations Ill make will be the ones that make the time to log in acceptable and imperceptible to the user, so dont worry about this.p  pstrongMy questions arestrong p  ol listrongWill making MANY iterations have a direct impact on the Instance Hours, or my assumptions about how the Instance Hours are summed are correctstrongli listrongIs there a CPU time quota on Google App Engine Im missing somehow Does it have a Free Quotastrongli listrongWhat is the Instance Hours Free Quotastrongli ol  pAnswersp  ol liLook Moishe accepted answer and the other question he asked which has not been answered but has usefull comments a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11525717whendoestheappenginescheduleruseanewthreadvsanewinstanceWhen does the App Engine scheduler use a new thread vs. a new instanceali liAccording to Google there is no CPU time quota a hrefhttpgoogleappengine.blogspot.com.es200902skysalmostlimithighcpuisnomore.html relnofollowhttpgoogleappengine.blogspot.com.es200902skysalmostlimithighcpuisnomore.htmlali liFound an answer to question number 3 here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11044186googleappenginefrontendinstancehourslimitreachedGoogle App Engine Frontend Instance Hours Limit Reachedali ol

Negative 64956 pI am new to Workflow foundation and want to understand the purpose of codeActivityActioncode and codeActivityFunccode and how it differs from having child activities instead.p  pAs far as I can understand child activities may exist in some composite codeNativeActivitycode and have to be scheduled by it. So child activities emmayem be used by codeNativeActivitycode as event handlers during its execution. So for example this NativeActivity may run some long running computation and schedule its child when it finishes.p  pcodeActivityActioncode and codeActivityFunccode func returns a result and action does not exist for the same purpose  to enable plugging custom handlers in the course of execution defined in the codeNativeActivitycode. The difference is that those are strongly typed and look more like contract declared by its parent.p  pSo I came to conclusion that the main difference is strong typing and ActivityFuncAction may be swapped with child activities. Is my understanding wrong or am I missing somethingp

Negative 64956 pThis is a follow up to a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12822961knockoutjssortablegroupobservablearraybyfieldandconditionallysortKnockoutJS Sortable group observableArray by field and conditionally sortap  pThere are two further things I am battling to achieve. First when a nested list item is dragged to another list leaving the parent empty I would like to remove the parent. I have done this by creating an afterMove function and checking if the sourceParent length is 0. Then I look through the routes to see if any have an empty tasks array and remove accordingly. I would like to know if this is an efficient solution. I also have to remove the tasks otherwise the tasks subscription adds duplicates when removing scheduled tasks.p  pSecond and most importantly the base object Task has an order property. I would like to bind this to the sortable order so that when the tasks are dragged around the Scheduled list the order property is updated. How do I access the order of other list items from the sortable callbackp  pPlease see the following this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmrfunnelh7ZPY relnofollowFiddlea.p  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.p

No properties folder is created... I manually copy over the properties folder in the project folder to this dist folder.p  pHowever, the program is not able to detect the properties files. Anyone have any clue as to why it can work inside Netbeans F6 function key and not able to work when in command line.p  pI simply typed at command line java jar MyApp.jarp  pThanksp

Negative 64956 pWell I have a question that is absolutely puzzling me.  I have a live wallpaper a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.simpleworkerz.boise.sunsetstW251bGwsMSwyLDIxMiwiY29tLnNpbXBsZXdvcmtlcnouYm9pc2Uuc3Vuc2V0cyJd relnofollowhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.simpleworkerz.boise.sunsetstW251bGwsMSwyLDIxMiwiY29tLnNpbXBsZXdvcmtlcnouYm9pc2Uuc3Vuc2V0cyJdap  pThe app contains both a live wallpaper and a slide show. The slide show version works just fine with the samsung both live wallpaper and slide show us the same opengl renderer, but when a user goes into live wallpapers and selects SET WALLPAPER the following occurs.p  p1The set wallpaper text changes color. although still remains like nothing was initiated 2The screen goes black again and the message Loading wallpaper begins 3 34 seconds later nothing appears and a message saying Boise Sunsets has stopped working and needs to close. Or clicking set wallpaper a second time will cause a force close.p  pEverything works fine before the user clicks set wallpaper so everything is rendering and displaying as it should.p  pSo I am assuming my problem has to do with oncreate or onsurface changed.  I dont quite understand what exactly is called when the button Set wallpaper is clicked.  Anyone knowp  pHere is my code for the wallpaper.p  precodeimport android.content.SharedPreferences import android.service.wallpaper. import android.util.Log import android.view.MotionEvent import

Negative 64956 pI have to report basically the same information from inspections to two different clients, both of whom have provided me with an Excel spreadsheet in their own preferred format, and password protected. I have put the two sheets into my own workbook, and have managed to get almost all the data on both sheets to populate from my own data. Where I am stuck though is on the time logs. p  pClient A has each time and date in a single column, in the format 12.29.12 1430. Client B has two columns, date as 122912 in the first, and time as 1430 in the second.p  pIm trying to avoid having to type all the same dates and times twice  it can be several dozen lines  both to save effort and to avoid errors. What I really need to do is either concatenate the date and time from client Bs report and put it into client As, or split the date and time up in As so I can put it ito Bs. Ive tried several approaches, but just end up with error codes or meaningless numbers. p  pCan anyone point me in the right directionp  pThanks, Richardp  pNever mind... the very next thing I tried worked p  pTo anyone else reading this, the trick is not to concatentate the date and time values, but to add them together.p  pRichardp

Negative 64956 pI think I have read every article google returns when I search wpf mvvmlight data validation and I dont know which way to go.  I am aware of josh smith, Karl Shiffletts, and MVVM LIGHTs own demo techniques for data validation.  What I see is that most validation requires me to fully reabstract my model in my view model.  Meaning that I have to create a property in my viewmodel for each property of my model that I want to validate and in some cases convert all these into string values for bindingvalidation.  This seems like a lot or redundancy when all I want to do is mark most fields as required.  p  pI am using LINQ to entity frameworkwith self tracking for my model classes which come from a SQL server DB.  As a result I would prefer to keep my business data validationrules within my viewmodels.  I write a simple service interface to get the data from the model and pass it to my viewmodel.p  pMost of the examples I can find are from as far back as 2008 ie josh smith.  Are these techniques still valid or are there more up to date best practices for mvvm data validation with .NET 4.5 etc.p  pSo I am askingp  p1 What methods do you suggest I use 2 What methods work best in a LINQ to EF with MVVMLight Environment. 3 EDIT I want to provide feedback to user as they enter data, not just when they submit form p  pthanksp

Negative 64956 pIve encountered with the problem when I dont need UITableView to reload its cells when I scroll it upwards and downwards. In simple words i created custom cells which have content that user can expand by clicking on it. For example I have a UILabel with a lot of text in it which doesnt display fully but user can click on  button and expand text and consequently a label,the same thing with the images which user can also expand. All this I implement via code[tableview beginUpdates]code and code[tableview endUpdates]code. All work perfectly BUT when I click button and expand text or image and scroll down to other cells and then up UITableView of course reload my cells content and text is hiding again but cell remains the same size and this looks ugly.pSo I need some way to disable reloading cells  or if it is not possible to emulate this or use some sort of hack or whatever.p I know there must be a way,because I saw apps based on tableviews in which after expanding content cells preserve state and content the same size after scroling. So i hope iOS experts will be able to solve this problem.Thanks in regards.p

Negative 64956 pI am designing a multiplatform application at the moment clients would include internally developed mobile apps, and an AJAX heavy javascript client initially centred around a REST API. Since in the future the API may be open to third parties, I am looking at using OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization with the API.p  pI am trying to get my head around some of the security issues with this arrangement, particularly with regard to the javascript client. I dont want this client to behave like a third party client might, with a whole bunch of redirects and popups and stuff, which is what most OAuth documentation seems to focus on. Since it will be delivered from my own domain, I am thinking that the server side of the webapp can be the actual client, and store the client secrets and refresh tokens, while the javascript retrieves new auth tokens from the server as it needs them.p  pTo put it in step by step formp  ol liThe user logs in using nonajax html form, generating auth and refresh tokens which are stored server side. This sets a HTTPonly login session cookie.li liThe javascript client code is sent to the users browser after login.li liThe javascript client makes a request to a resource that is part of its own application not part of REST api to retrieve the token. The session cookie ensures that the client is genuine, and the referer will also be checked. Auth token is returned.li liThe javascript client validates the token with the REST API.li liThe client can now use the token to make requests against the REST API until it expires.li liIf the auth token expires or the page is closed and reopened, the javascript client can  request a new token. The server side of the webapp takes care of refreshing the token and sends the new token, as long as the login session cookie is still valid.li ol  pDoes this make sense, or would it leave massive holes in the system In particular, is it insane to have a resource on the web that hands out authentication tokens based on a cookie being setp

Negative 64956 pIm a bit stuck with implementing masterdetail views in emberjs. p  pMost of my views have a masterview which is just a list of titles. Then, a user can click such title and heshe gets an overlay with the detailview somewhat like a typical newsitem page. p  pNow, I noticed that when ember asks the information for the masterview it calls urls like codebackendnewsitemscode. But these calls can get very heavy because the backend returns a list of all newsitems with all their detailed data. But this feels wrong because the user is only looking at the masterview and didnt request any detailed information yet.p  pIs there a way to make ember clear that the masterview only needs several attributes and that a request for detailed information should get the extra attributes of that particular itemp  pJust as an example, my model looks like thisp  precodeApp.Newsitem  DS.Model.extend   slug DS.attrstring,   type DS.attrstring,   title DS.attrstring,   summary DS.attrstring,   text DS.attrstring,   thumb DS.attrstring,   date DS.attrdate,    mediaitems DS.hasManyApp.Mediaitem  codepre  pBut my masterview only needs codeidcode codetypecode codetitlecode to show a list of titles and an icon next to that title. Then, when a user request the detail of one newsitem all other attributes should be fetched.p

Negative 64956 pI have a codeBetcode object managed by coredata in an iphone app I am developing.p  pI would like to add a UID betnum attribute to this bet object so in the future I can push the bets to a server using this UID to know if it already exists on the server from a previous push. I understand that this is going to involve me updating the version of the iPhone app, adding this attribute to the codeBetcode class and setting this attribute to an incremented value for all codeBetcode objects already managed by core data from the previous version as well as any new ones.p  pFor this I need to migrate the object model using either a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataVersioningArticlesvmLightweightMigration.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40004399CH4SW1 relnofollowLightweight Migrationa or by creating my own a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataVersioningArticlesvmMappingOverview.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40004399CH5SW1 relnofollowMapping Modela. I have read that I should use the Lightweight Migration where possible because creating my own Mapping Model can get messy. I know it is possible to use Lightweight Migration to add an attribute to an existing object but I dont know about setting specific values by autoincrementing or something similar.p  pCan I use Lightweight Migration for this Do I use Lightweight Migration and then set the values in the code after the migration using some sort of after migration hook or onAppUpdate method Or am I destined to create my own Mapping Model p
Negative 64956 pIm trying to design a simple wildlife tracking DB, so that when myself or my colleagues spot an animal we can enter its ear tag number via a form.

Negative 64956 pIm trying to do something that seems like this. It should be simple but Ive been beating my head against a wall all week.  I have a data frame with 256 columns from which Im generating all unique combinations of 2x2 tables using codetablecode, run statistics on the tables, like codechisq.testcode and codeoddsratioscode while using codesinkcode to pipe the output to a file.  The problem comes when I want to embed plots with the text.  Id like to have the first section of each table contain histograms of the two variables but plots and text do not seem to mix.  Ive not been able to find anything about how to redirect the plot device.  As an aside, I gotten to where if I use codeX11code and codeparcode I can get a multiplot figure to a plot output file.  So I can do the two things I want, but not at the same time.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.p

Negative 64956 pSo, I decided to learn Assembly Language for the 80x86 this summer. I picked up four books on assembly. So far Ive read the first two and Im half way though the third one and I think I understand everything that has been presented. Ive written a few Hello World programs as well as other little exercises from the book and I feel very comfortable with the language. However, there is one thing that none of the books have addressed so far and its the thing that Im most interested in. That is, How do you address the hardware directly from assembly language So far in the books the author has used system calls, jumps to specific functions in memory, and interrupts, but these methods rely on software already present in the system.p  pIm writing my programs using NASM and loading them into an old Pentium I computer. Im not using any OS right now, just the BIOS. I guess what Im trying to do is write my little OS that is autonomous and does not rely on the BIOS except for initial boot. Can anyone help mep
Negative 64956 pIve been recently running a little research project on the performance of sequential or random access to an NSArray in relation to a C Array. Most of the test cases are showing up as id expect however a few dont work how I thought they would and im hoping somebody might be able to explain why.p  pFundamentally the test consists of filling a C Array with 50k objects, iterating over each one and calling a method which internally just increments a float in the object, the second part of the test involves creating a loop that completes 50k iterations but accesses a random object in the array. Basically its pretty simple.p  pTo do the comparison im initializing the NSArray with the C Array. Each test is then run via a block passed in to a method which tracks the time it take to execute the block. The code im using is contained below but id like to cover the results and queries I have first.p  pThese tests were run on an iPhone 4 and wrapped in a dispatchafter to mitigate any remaining threading or non atomic operations as a result of starting the app. The results of a single run are as follows, each run is essentially the same with minor variationsp  precodeSEQUENCE NSARRAY FAST ENUMERATION 12ms NSARRAY FAST ENUMERATION WEAK 186ms NSARRAY BLOCK ENUMERATION 31ms 258.3 C ARRAY DIRECT 7ms 58.3 C ARRAY VARIABLE ASSIGN 33ms 275.0 C ARRAY VARIABLE ASSIGN WEAK 200ms 1666.7  RANDOM NSARRAY RANDOM 102ms 850.0 Relative to fast enumeration C ARRAY DIRECT RANDOM 39ms 38.2 Relative to NSArray Random C ARRAY VARIABLE ASSIGN RANDOM 82ms 80.4 codepre  pThe fastest approach seems to be directly accessing the items in the C Array using carray  idx, what is most puzzling though is that assigning the pointer from the C Array to an objective c variable id object  carry  idx causes a massive performance hit.p  pI figured initially it was maybe arc doing something with reference counting as the variable was strong so at this point I changed it to weak expecting the performance to increase weak id object  carry  idx. To my surprise it was actually a lot slower.p  pThe random access results went pretty well how id expected based on the sequence results, so no surprises there luckily enough.p  pAs a result of this there are a number of questionsp  ol liWhy does assigning to a variable take so longli liWhy does assigning to a weak variable take even longer Maybe there is something I dont understand going on hereli liConsidering the above how have Apple got the standard fast enumeration to perform so wellli ol  pAnd for completeness here is the code.

Negative 64956 pSo for a project i decided to make a sudoku solver that first uses finds naked singles cells with only one possible value and then just brute forces its way to victory. p  pThis is my first time using multiple files in program and as such my first time using a makefile, but the errors i am getting arent during compile time so i think my makefile is fine.p  pI tried debugging with GSB but it doesnt really seem to help all that much... If i had to guess i think te problem is occuring with my class Cells destructor.p  pTo give you a brief overview of the project so I dont just spit code at you The class puzzle contains a 9x9 matrix of the class Cell. The class Cell contains two integers to represent position on the board row and column, an integer value the actual value of the cell and an array of 9 booleans that represent the possible candidates for the the value of the cell 0 in the array represents the value is not a possible candidate, 1 means it is  so for example candidate[2] is the third value in the array, so if it was 1 it means that 3 is a possible value for the cell.p  pNow onto the code. My code is made up of 5 files main.cpp, puzzle.cpp, cell.cpp, puzzle.h, and cell.h. a hrefhttppastebin.comupermatrash relnofollowHere is a link to my pastebin of the 5 files and the makefilea.p  pI would advise you not pay attention to the huge functions in puzzle.cpp checkConflicts and eliminateCandidates as they are both just long if statements that make sure no cells conflictelinimate confliction candidates.p  pThe debugger jumps to the cell destructor that deletes the candidate array, but i dont see a problem with itp  pHere is a copy of the error that i get after making and running the programp  precode make g c puzzle.cpp cell.h g c cell.cpp g o sudsolve main.cpp puzzle.o cell.o   .sudsolve   Error in .sudsolve munmapchunk invalid pointer 0x0000000000a30fd4   Backtrace  libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.60x7f576[0x7fcaecc1f576] .sudsolve[0x40bbdb] .sudsolve[0x401cd2] .sudsolve[0x402a12] .sudsolve[0x402a84] .sudsolve[0x402299] .sudsolve[0x401e38] .sudsolve[0x40156a] libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.6libcstartmain0xf5[0x7fcaecbc1ea5] .sudsolve[0x400eb9]  Memory map  004000000040e000 rxp 00000000 fc04 2097787                            homesilmanDocumentsprogrammingecs60sudsolvesudsolve 0060d0000060e000 rp 0000d000 fc04 2097787                            homesilmanDocumentsprogrammingecs60sudsolvesudsolve 0060e0000060f000 rwp 0000e000 fc04 2097787                            homesilmanDocumentsprogrammingecs60sudsolvesudsolve 00a3000000a51000 rwp 00000000 0000 0                                  [heap] 7fcaec89b0007fcaec99e000 rxp 00000000 fc04 1576781                    libx8664linuxgnulibm2.17.so 7fcaec99e0007fcaecb9e000 p 00103000 fc04 1576781                    libx8664linuxgnulibm2.17.so 7fcaecb9e0007fcaecb9f000 rp 00103000 fc04 1576781                    libx8664linuxgnulibm2.17.so 7fcaecb9f0007fcaecba0000 rwp 00104000 fc04 1576781                    libx8664linuxgnulibm2.17.so 7fcaecba00007fcaecd5e000 rxp 00000000 fc04 1576733                    libx8664linuxgnulibc2.17.so 7fcaecd5e0007fcaecf5d000 p 001be000 fc04 1576733                    libx8664linuxgnulibc2.17.so 7fcaecf5d0007fcaecf61000 rp 001bd000 fc04 1576733                    libx8664linuxgnulibc2.17.so 7fcaecf610007fcaecf63000 rwp 001c1000 fc04 1576733                    libx8664linuxgnulibc2.17.so 7fcaecf630007fcaecf68000 rwp 00000000 0000 0  7fcaecf680007fcaecf7c000 rxp 00000000 fc04 1576758                    libx8664linuxgnulibgccs.so.1 7fcaecf7c0007fcaed17c000 p 00014000 fc04 1576758                    libx8664linuxgnulibgccs.so.1 7fcaed17c0007fcaed17d000 rp 00014000 fc04 1576758                    libx8664linuxgnulibgccs.so.1 7fcaed17d0007fcaed17e000 rwp 00015000 fc04 1576758                    libx8664linuxgnulibgccs.so.1 7fcaed17e0007fcaed263000 rxp 00000000 fc04 271362                     usrlibx8664linuxgnulibstdc.so.6.0.17 7fcaed2630007fcaed462000 p 000e5000 fc04 271362                     usrlibx8664linuxgnulibstdc.so.6.0.17 7fcaed4620007fcaed46a000 rp 000e4000 fc04 271362                     usrlibx8664linuxgnulibstdc.so.6.0.17 7fcaed46a0007fcaed46c000 rwp 000ec000 fc04 271362                     usrlibx8664linuxgnulibstdc.so.6.0.17 7fcaed46c0007fcaed481000 rwp 00000000 0000 0  7fcaed4810007fcaed4a4000 rxp 00000000 fc04 1576709                    libx8664linuxgnuld2.17.so 7fcaed6840007fcaed689000 rwp 00000000 0000 0  7fcaed6a00007fcaed6a3000 rwp 00000000 0000 0  7fcaed6a30007fcaed6a4000 rp 00022000 fc04 1576709                    libx8664linuxgnuld2.17.so 7fcaed6a40007fcaed6a6000 rwp 00023000 fc04 1576709                    libx8664linuxgnuld2.17.so 7fff88ba80007fff88bc9000 rwp 00000000 0000 0                          [stack] 7fff88bfe0007fff88c00000 rxp 00000000 0000 0                          [vdso] ffffffffff600000ffffffffff601000 rxp 00000000 0000 0                  [vsyscall] Aborted core dumped codepre
Negative 64956 pI am trying to make the following thing work but without successp  pI defined my own type codeUnitcode inherit from buildin type codefloatcode to implement algebra for quantities with units. It does things in the way thatp  precodeclass Unitfloat provide a simple unit converter for a given quantity      def newcls, unit, num1.         return superUnit, cls.newcls, num      def initself, unit, num1.         set up base unit         self.unit  unit      def strself,         return s s.formatsuperUnit, self.str, self.unit      def rmulself, other         print rmul f.formatsuperUnit, self.rmulother         return Unitself.unit, superUnit, self.rmulother      def toself,target         funconv  convself.unit, target         return  Unittarget, numfunconvself    c  3e8  Unitms    this will 1 create a Unit instance with magnitude 1 and unit ms,                                    2 invoke rmul to return a new instance with number 3e8 and unit ms to variable c print c.tokms       returns 3e5 kms codepre  pHowever, this codermulcode is only invoked when codefloatcode being the left operand. If I make something like thisp  precodevelocities  np.array[20, 10]  Unitms codepre  pThen codeUnit.rmulcode will not be invoked, and the same codenumpy ndarraycode is returned since now codeUnitmscode was treated like a plain codefloatcode with value 1.0p  pWhat I expect is after codendarray  Unitcode, a function similar to codeUnit.tocode can be attacted to the instance of ndarray as a method as well as an attribute codeunitcode, so I can further call codendarray.tocode to return a copy or modified version, if it could, for memory efficiency of the original ndarray that associated with new values and unit. How do I proceedp  pAccording what I have known and searched, codemulcode of the left operand will be of the prior during codecode, i.e., the interpretor checks codeLO.mulcode first, if it fails, then goes to codeRO.rmulcode. I dont quite want to override codenumpy.ndarray.mulcode because I really dont know how complicated it would be, and whether there would be a big mess in case that it breaks the rules that ndarray acting on other objects.p  pAnd, actually I even cannot find where are the codes that defines codemulcode for codendarraycode. I simply used codeinspect.getsourcenp.ndarraycode but without success. Why does it fail on this the exception was barely an codeIOErrorcode.p  pThank you so much for your concernp

Negative 64956 pIm using the latest version of the Facebook SDK, version 3.1.2, for Unity. My problem is somewhat similar to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18703538newfacebooksdkforunitytroublelogginginoniosandroidquestiona. The differences being that my iOS builds work just fine. And my Android builds arent getting null references. Instead, My android build will just not log in. p  pWhen I click my login button, itll bring up the dialogue screen to give the app permission to access the basic stuff, public profile and friend list. Upon hitting the ok button, itll return me to my app but fail the login. I found the AndroidFacebook class and noticed that OnLoginComplete function has a string message param where it should grab the users id and access token from. So I put a debug message in there to see what was being returned. It turns out that although I press ok to give the app access to facebook, its saying that the process was cancelled. cancelledtrue is the Json string being returned. Ive doubled check my app settings in the facebook developer page and the Package name, class name and debug hash key all match what I have in the Unity Facebook settings. Ive even tried with the Sandbox mode on and off.p

Negative 64956 pIve recently been reading about the behaviour of codeGStringImplcodes vs codeStringcodes when used in collections in Groovy.p  pI understand that the reason this evaluates to false...p  pcodetest.equalstest  falsecode p  pis due to the symmetry requirement of the code.equalscode contract, however I was wondering if there was a reason the codeGStringImplcode couldnt just be evaluated to a codeStringcode immediately.

Plus, if you resize your window, it appears to jump from the right to the left at a certain point for no apparent reason.

The goal is to get thermometer.png centered both horizontally and vertically on the page, and on top of all the other images.p  pNext The images are HUGE And take FOREVER to load, so if youre on a limited internet connection, I suggest moving on to someone elses question. Im working on that. As Im sure you can tell, Im new to most of this. Ive been rebuilding wordpress themes for most of my limited webdesign experience, and none of it includes this kind of thing.

Negative 64956 pIm developing a fairly standard web application with Wicket, Spring amp Hibernate. Ive been using codewicketauthrolescode and codespringsecuritycode to authenticate users, and now want to add more fine grained authorizations to my applications.p  pIn my applications users are members of groups, and groups have access to a subset of Hibernate objects that I use as wicket codeIModelcode objects. As such the decision whether or not a user may view certain page does not depend on the page path, but on the page strongemmodelemstrong. Most implementations of authorization for Wicket Ive seen either grant access to a url or restrict it they do not perform any checks on the model object.p  pAt present Ive implemented this restriction as a custom a hrefhttpci.apache.orgprojectswicketapidocs6.xorgapachewicketauthorizationIAuthorizationStrategy.html relnofollowIAuthorizationStrategya like thisp  precodeOverride public boolean isActionAuthorizedfinal Component component, final Action action      if component instanceof GenePage          We only check access to the GenePage for now         return true       Figure out from component what Gene the user is trying to view     Gene gene  Gene component.getDefaultModelObject     User user  MySession.get.getUserModel.getObject     return geneDAO.hasAccessuser, gene  codepre  pThe problem with this implementation is that it fully composes the page and only in codePageonConfigurecode throws an uncaught codeUnauthorizedActionExceptioncode. So far Ive been unable to catch this exception, so its logged as a problem even though its part of the normal program flow. Fully composing the page also triggers a few actions in my page constructor and codePageonInitializecode that I would only like to run if the user may actually view the Page.p  pstrongCan anyone recommend me a better approach to restrict page access based on whether users have access to the Model objectstrongp  pSolutions that tie in anywhere along the stack using Hibernate, Spring, Spring Security, Wicket andor WicketAuthRoles would be preferred. I know there are other wicket authintegrations out there, so if you feel those could help in this instance, please let me knowp

Negative 64956 pI am working with Android and java projects. My task is to create a class which should draw a rectangle on the canvas. I wanted to know, if it is a good practice to program a constructor such that it can do more than just initializing the variables. Ofcourse, I am aware that I can create an object of a class, the constructor of which will initialize the variables and then call the public method to draw the rectangle. However, I would like to know if it is a good practice to program the constructor which will also draw the rectangle thus getting rid of the public method.p  pAny comments would be appreciated.p

Negative 64956 pOk, so this is my homework assignment.  But before everyone says, figure it out, I have gotten the program to work. I just cant figure out why it wont work for the full ten characters of an integer.  The homework asks a user to input an integer.  Using one switch we are to print the number in single integer words 26 would be two six.  I can get that to work.  The problem Im having is when I enter 10 as the integer it prints, one two three four five six seven eight zero zero.  If I enter 19 it prints, one two three four five six seven nine nine.

Negative 64956 pI am uploading a file to server using the HttpsURLConnection class in Android. I am using PUT method. In normal circumstances it is working fine, but when I am attempting to write a file to the folder in a server, which does not have write permissions,  the write method should fail and then when I use getResponseCode I should recieve a 403 Forbidden response from the server.  I have to use the 403 response to show a No Permissions message to the user.p  pNow, when the file size that I upload is less than the buffer size 16K, the write method returns and the getResponseCode returns 403. However, when the file size is bigger which is usually the case, the program stucks in the write method and thus does not reach the getResponseCode  at all.

Negative 64956 pIm pretty new to Selenium, but have good coding experiencep  pIm working on automation of very complex web application.  For my testing im using junit framework. p  pI dont want my classes to expand to gigantic sizes, so this is how im dividing my automation per page. For ex. i have homepage. From it i can get to settings, dashboard and many other pages. So all modificationsfunctionality related to homePage i keep at homepage class. Then for each next page i have another class, where im creating webdriver and assigning it to the previous page webdriver. So again each class is reflecting functionality i can achieve on that particular page. p  pSo lets say i have 4th level page, i will have a class of that 4th level, on creating it will go to create 3rd level page, 3rd will create 2nd level first ans so on,and at some point i will get down to the very first login page. Basically i have a tree with my loginPage in the head of it.p  pIt works very well and i have no problems with it until it comes to junit.  I like an idea of closing the browser in my After class and im having different page classes.. How can i bend it all together that no matter what classPage i create and work with at my test, my after method is closing that browserp  pThanksp

Negative 64956 pI have a class like the following, that I want to unit testp  precodepublic class AddUserCommand      IDbContext dbContext      public AddUserCommandIDbContext context             dbContext  context           public void Execute              dbContext.Users.Addnew User         dbContext.SaveChanges       codepre  pUltimately I need to test whether the Execute method persists the new User to the database when using a real sql database connection. But for my unit tests I obviously want to use some kind of mock object. In my tests, I can make a mock IDbContext which mimics the behaviour, and it all works. I can test that the mock context contains the new user after the Execute method has been run. p  pMy problem is that when using the mock context, the test will pass if I do not call the SaveChanges method. This is because the mock context does not need to make an sql query to actually persist the data. It persists without the call to SaveChanges because the Users collection represents the persistent store.p  pIn order to check that SaveChanges is called, many online sources  for example  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff714955.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff714955.aspxa and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comengbdatadn314431.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comengbdatadn314431.aspxa  say to add something like this to the mock contextp  precodepublic class MockDbContext  IDbContext      boolean saved     public void SaveChanges          saved  true       codepre  pAnd then test if the saved variable is true after the Execute method is called. However, what I find lacking in this approach is that such a test will pass if the Execute method did thisp  precodepublic void Execute      dbContext.SaveChanges     dbContext.Users.Addnew User  codepre  pWhich of course would not save any changes as it is done too early. I believe that mocking frameworks like RhinoMocks allow you to test the order of method calls to the mock context, but I have also read that this is not best practice you should test the result, not the minutae of the implementation.p  pThe problem is that the mock context does not exactly replicate what the real DbContext will do.p  pSo my question is is there a standard way to mock an entity framework DbContext in such a way that any additions or deletions of objects are only committed to the mock when SaveChanges is called Or is this not something that is generally tested forp

Negative 64956 pIm trying to write the unique strings in a file to a linked list and increment a count for each duplicate word. I want to use a getNextWord function that returns a pointer to the next word in the file.

So how do I use my function to get the string that needs to be a key for a node Also any other advice would be greatly appreciated and if you see anything wrong with my function or struct please let me know Thank you very much for your time.

Negative 64956 pIm trying to simulate in Matlab the traffic of a network of 14 nodes and 21 links. I have a function called NewConnection and another called  Closeconnection  among others.p  pFor now I have implemented traffic using a for loop. In each iteration is called NewConnection that randomly chooses a source node , a destination node and a random duration now this value is an integer is executed. This connection may or may not be set lock.p  pAfter, is called the Closeconnection function, which checks all connection times stored in an array and if they have a value of 0 closes the connection.p  pFinally, before the end of the loop, is subtracted a temporary unit to all connections established least the last one.p  pWhat I would like is to perform this simulation using a system that implements a time eg 1 minute and at any time, any node establishes a new connection. For examplep  precodet0.000134 s  Node1 to Node8 t0.003024 s  Node12 to Node11 t0.003799 s  Node6 to Node3 . . . t59.341432 s  Node1 to Node4 codepre  pAnd the CloseConnection function considers these time to close connections.p  pI have searched for information on Simulink, SimEvents, Parallel computing, Discrete event simulation... but I can not really understand the functioning.p  pThank you very much in advance and apologies for my English.p

So first 46 symbols are flight number then other ones are departures and arivals their lengths are 3 symbols.   p  precodefirst string DY947CPHVNO  it means that its flight number DY947 from CPH to VNO DY947 CPH VNO string1  DY947 flight number string2  CPH from CPH string3  VNO to VNO  first string DA9128VNOBGODY989BGOCPH  it means that its flight number DA9128 from VNO to BGO then flight number DY989 from BGO to CPH  DA9128 VNO BGO DY989 BGO CPH string1  DA9128 flight number string2  VNO from VNO string3  BGO to BGO string4  DY989 flight number string5  BGO  from BGO string6  CPH to CPH codepre  pSecond string means that to reach destination person needs 2 flights.p  pThe only thing that is dinamic here, is flight number, I cant use patern with codesubstrcode and coderegexcode since I dont know its length.

Negative 64956 pI have a grid, in which some rows with data are inherited. That is, there are some parent rows and child rows. Child rows have codeidinheritcode field set to the codeidcode of the parent row. The grid is editable. Now I want to add a functionality which makes it possible to analyze changes in all child rows. If some value in some cell is different from that in the parent row, then I want to change the background of that very cell in the inherited row. I want to to do this analytics on the fly, in other words, I want to make it when the user hits the button. Now, I parse my grid rows like thisp  precodevar store  Ext.getCmpgrid.getStore store.eachfunctionrecord,idx   ifrecord.getidinherit0  grid row is inherited      here I want to compare values in all cells of this row      and the parent row, whose id is equal to record.getidinherit      if values are different in a particular cell of the inherited row, then      I want to change its background color             codepre  pstrongEDITstrongp  pNow, without any comparison, I just try to change cell color of all inherited rows, but it does not work. I do it like thisp  precodestore.eachfunctionrecord,idx   ifrecord.getidinherit0       grid.getView.addRowClsidx,red        I guess I should have used addCls instead, but        I do not know how to target a particular cell inside this record        and change its class correctly        but of course, I know column names and indices     codepre  pAnd coderedcode style is defined like thisp  precode.red backgroundcolor red important codepre  pIt is not working. If I knew how to change cell color dynamically, I could do all the other routine  comparing with parent rows etc.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI tried practically all solutions posted at stackoverflow and which seem relative to some extent to my problem, but none of them work. What I want to stress again, is that I need to change background color of a particular cell  NOT of the entire row and NOT of the entire column. And I want to do it on the button click  NOT inside the render function.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI consulted this article a hrefhttpjaspreetchahal.orgextjs4gridchangecellcolorbyaddingandremovingclassesprogramatically relnofollowExtJS 4 Grid Change Cell Color a, but the author manupulates with the dom of the selected row and does it like thisp  precodevar selection  grid.getView.getSelectionModel.getSelection[0] var dom  grid.getView.getSelectedNodes[0] tds  Ext.getdom.selectdiv Ext.gettds.elements[evt.target.offsetParent.cellIndex].addClsblack codepre  pBut in my case, where I iterate through the grid store, I do not know how to get to the codedomcode of the current record, then select the codedivcode and add a custom class.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWell, I tried thousands of tricks, but nothing works at all. If someone could advise me on how to parse a grid record to get to the cell htmlstructure, I would mark this advise as an answer. What I now know, inspecting the dom structure, is, for example, one of my cells has this css class codexgridcell xgridcell73892 xgridcelllastcode. What make it unique is this part codexgridcell73892code.

Who would have thought, that such a trivial thing  the most trivial that I can imagine  that is to change the background color of a cell on button click, has no simple solution. At this point I have no solution in fact.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWell, I did it myself.

Negative 64956 pI have 5 Excel files that have to be compiled into one csv file that can be uploaded to our website for our affiliated stores database. Until now weve had someone manually cut and paste the rows of each file into one master csv file in Excel then they upload that file to the website.p  pIve been trying to use Python to consolidate the files so the user would just have to run the Python script that would do this for her. The problem is that the Excel files are encoded in ShiftJIS and when I use CSV writer in Python they get converted to UTF8. The website we upload them to will only accept files in ShiftJIS, so I have to keep all of this data in ShiftJIS.p  pSince DOS automatically defaults to ascii encoding, I first have to run thisp  precodeimport codecs, sys, xlrd, csv reloadsys sys.setdefaultencodingshiftjis codepre  pHere is a sample of the code for one of the Excel files, which has data on 2 separate worksheetsp  precodewith xlrd.openworkbookCircle.xls as wb    for sheet in wb.sheets      fn  store      print Converting files..      with openfn  sheet.name  .csv,wb as f        c  csv.writerf,dialectexcel        for r in rangesheet.nrows           c.writerowsheet.rowvaluesr codepre  pThe conversion runs until it finds a UTF8 character that doesnt exist in shiftJIS, then it errors out. p  pIs there a way to convert from Excel to a csv purely in shiftJISp  pIf my question has a flaw, please ask me to edit it before marking it down I will edit itp

Negative 64956 pI have a program written in Python that at some point creates a subprocess and then has to get its std output in real time through a file the process takes a while and some output is needed while it is still running.  The problem is that, sometimes, a chunk of the output is lost actually a chunk starting at the begining. The code looks like this p  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeimport subprocess import tempfile import time .. tfout  tempfile.TemporaryFile tferr  tempfile.TemporaryFile tfin  tempfile.TemporaryFile  tfin.writesomestdin tfin.seek0   create the process process  subprocess.Popencommand, shellTrue,             stdintfin,             stdouttfout,             stderrtferr  running  True while running      last iteration if process ended     if process.poll is not None         running  False       read output     tfout.seek0           1     stdout  tfout.read   2       do something with the partial output     dosomethingstdout      time.sleep0.1  tfout.close tferr.close tfin.close .. codepre  pI wonder if it is possible that the problem may be between code 1code and code 2code, in case that the subprocess write something, then seek to zero at code 1code, another write starting at zero because of the seek wrong one, and finally the read at point code 2code doesnt see the first write. If thats the problem, any idea how to do itp  pThanks in advancep

This works ok but we want to filter the autocomplete results by particular areas which we define in polygons. p  pAs google does not send the latitude and longitude in the response it is not possible to use their api.

Negative 64956 pIve done a ton of research on this topic. Ive tried every plausible solution under the internets sun.

Negative 64956 pIm working on a project for class using Java and UDP senders and receivers. The premise of the problem is to read in a text file, store the contents within a packet, send the packet, receive the packet, and read out the file on screen and create a new text document on the receiving computer of an identical text file.p  pI have all of that working. When I test with a local host it appears to work 100 of the time. When I send it from my laptop to my PC it appears to work 100 of the time. However, when I send it from my PC to my laptop it does not work. p  pI have several System.out debug statements to verify some of the information I send. I know that the text file should take 7 packets. However, whenever I send it from my PC to my laptop it says that I am sending 46 packets.p  pMy initial thought is that maybe the packets are being sent out of order. The first packet I am sending indicates how many packets the receiver should be expecting to receive. I thought maybe for some reason the 46 could indicate a capital F so I removed all the capital F and it still says Im sending 46 packets. p  pI thought maybe I was sending too much information at once so I used Thread.sleep to give my receiver time to keep up  that did not work either.p  pFinally, I read through the Oracle Documentation and some posts online and found out that UDP is unreliable. So, Im assuming it could potentially be that. However, I want to just verify that that could be the issue.p  pOr if anyone has a better idea as to what could be causing the problem that would be awesome as wellp  pThanks for your help p
Negative 64956 pIm currently working on a website and I need to have a wide navigation bar with only three linksbuttons there.

Negative 64956 pI am making an interface to compare images on which some processing will be done.

This however is not as easily done with the image dragging because it is comprised of multiple events.p  pIt is feeling very hacked together and I would like to know if there is a better way to achieve this.

Negative 64956 phope you can helpp  pMy current project requires me to recall a set of functions on window resize so that I can keep the responsive nature correct. However the code I am using is rather twitchy as it calls the functions even if the window is resized by 1px.p  pI am relatively new to jQuery but learning more and more every day, but this is something Im struggling to find a way to do.p  pIn an ideal world I would like to call the functions when the window has been resized over a breaking point at anytime, for examplep  psay the breaking point is 500px, the initial load size is 400px the user resizes to 600px, so over the threshold so call the functions again.  It would also need to work in reverse... so window or load size 600px, breaking point 500px, resize to 400px call functions.p  pHeres the code Im currentlyp  precodevar windowWidth  window.width  var resizing  1  window.resizefunctiona     1  resizing ampamp clearTimeoutresizing    resizing  setTimeoutdoResize, 200   function doResize    callthesefunctions         codepre  pCheers for the help guysp  hr  pThanks for the reply Zzep  pI am using something similar to what youve put, but I have it based within the start of my functions to filter what each thing does based on the window size. My problem is that these are getting called far too often and causing issues  twitchy behaviour. p  pFor example Im having issues on a tablet Im testing on, when you scroll down, the scrollbar that appears  on the right seems to trigger the window resize... causing functions to be called again that automatically accordion up or .hide elements to their initial loaded state.p  pSo my thinking is if I can test its actually broken a set threshold rather than just what size the window is then it will be far more reliable.p

Negative 64956 pI am doing an assignment involving percolationlong story short, I have an array of arrays that represents a grid, and every entry is 1, 0, or 1.

On the Mac App Store its correctly displayed as being available in German language only.p  pI have recently added InApp Purchase functionality to this app. It works fine but there is a major issue regarding localization Whenever an user is trying to make an InApp Purchase, StoreKit displays a misleading message text insisting that the user is logged in to the wrong store and needs to switch to the German store because the InApp Purchase item is only available in the German store. Naturally, this scares away potential German customers as they of course emareem already logged in to the German store and the message that is displayed nevertheless makes no sense to them. Furthermore, the selling price of the purchase is displayed using the wrong currency  instead of  because StoreKit somehow doesnt honor the users App Store region affiliation.sup1sup p  pThis feels like a bug in StoreKit  iTunes Connect, but Apple hasnt shown to be helpful in investigating the issue so far.

Negative 64956 pI am building a database for a system holding lists containing items. A list can contain other lists which, in order to model in the database just requires a list to have a parent column with a foreign key to the ID. However, another requirement of the system is that a list can inherit particular columns from its ancestors, this seems much harder to model.p  pSo, a list might have an ID, title, description and one or more items. However, descendant lists with a null description will inherit description from the nearest ancestor with a nonnull value.p  pI am stumped as to how to model this both in the design and query side. Im keen for the DB MySQL to do the heavy lifting if possible rather than having to do it in code.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionsp

It is prediction about stored procedures.  I dont mind solving the issue by only calling stored procedures with the correct number of parameters or adding dummy parameters to stored procedures, I just want MS SQL Server to tell me at compile time, not at runtime.  Since MS SQL Server actually verifies whether or not a procedure exists it gives a warning if it does not, although Id prefer if it failed like Sybase ASE, why cant it check its parameters at the same timep

Negative 64956 pSo Im struggling with a bit of an issue here.  I am trying to put a codeUITextViewcode as a footerView for a codeUITableViewControllercode.p  pHowever, since depending on what data the UITextView has it is set up in codeviewDidLoadcode, it can be different text at runtime.  So I can never know how tall the codeUITextViewcode will be.  Its width is the same as the UITableView though.p  pI figured if I get the width of the codeUITableViewcode and the text of the codeTextViewcode, I can calculate the size it is supposed to be.  So I wrote this code for codeCGFloattableViewUITableView tableView heightForFooterInSectionNSIntegersectioncodep  precode    get the width of the tableView.     CGFloat width  self.tableView.frame.size.width      if its bigger than the screen for some reason, or zero, set it to the screens width.     if width gt [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.width  width         width  [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.width  10      get the text from the textView, including attributes.     NSAttributedString attributedText  textView.attributedText      figure out the size its supposed to be.     CGRect rect  [attributedText boundingRectWithSizeCGSizewidth, CGFLOATMAX                                                optionsNSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin                                                contextnil]     CGSize size  rect.size     size.height  ceilfsize.height     size.width   ceilfsize.width       return the height, plus a little padding to be safe.     return size.height  10 codepre  pSo heres the ugly thing.  At the time codetableViewheightForFooterInSectioncode gets called, the codeTableViewcodes frame is some wacky number like 600.  The calculation is wrong, usually too small, and the codeUITextViewcode is cut off by the low height that gets returned.p  pHowever, if I emrotateem the device, this code gets run again, and it emworksem  So I know this code is good...emif run laterem.p  pIf I do a code[tableView reloadData]code at any point, it also fixes the codeTableViewcode.  Its only on first load that it gets cut off.p  pIf I could figure out a way to reload the codetableViewcode emonceem after it finishes loading, thatd fix it, but Im not sure how to do it and its kind of a hacky solution anyway.  p  pCan anyone help me figure out better logic for this  Ive been stumped for some time.p

But given that the CLR is supposed to be languageagnostic yet support tight coupling between components written in different languages, I would expect CIL to work at the objectlevel and perhaps have its own type system. I can imagine that type system being less strict than C, and possibly a few other things that emcouldem be different. But I was wondering if anybody knows definitively without having to read the entire language specification...p

Negative 64956 pIve been self teaching myself ruby and rails for the past year and finally have an app ready that I want to deploy out to the world.

They all seem like webservers, but clearly nginx is different from unicorn.

Negative 64956 pI would like to write something in the browser which records gestures on the trackpad.  p  pSince I wanted to be able to track all motion without having to worry about the pointer leaving the window, I first researched this problem and used the a hrefhttpmdn.github.iopointerlockdemo relnofollowMDN Pointer Lock API demoa as a starting point.  p  pBut I notice when using this demo on a MacBook that if I lift my finger and start a new drag elsewhere on the trackpad, it ignores the distance my finger traveled in the air, it only counts the motion done while my finger is touching the trackpad. This is consistent with the way that the trackpad is used to move the mouse pointer in the operating system in general.p  pBut for my specific application, I want to have the strongabsolutestrong x and y of my finger on the trackpad.  Would it be possible to build a variant of the demo linked above where the red dot corresponds to the absolute position of your finger  e.g., if you lifted your finger and then put it down in the upper left, the red dot would always jump to the upper left of the canvasp  pIm aware of the javascript a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPITouchevents relnofollowTouch Events APIa, which gives absolute coordinates when used on a tablet, but the a hrefhttpsmdn.mozillademos.orgenUSdocsWebAPIToucheventssamplesExamplerevision779705 relnofollowdemoa does not register any trackpad input when run on the MacBook under Firefox v36 or Chrome v41.p  pI have also read that its possible to enable touch emulation in Chrome, though I could not find the checkbox to do that under my version perhaps only special developer builds have this and from reading about it, it seems like its more of a mousetotouch translation so Im doubtful that that emulation would have specific support for trackpads.p  pIs there any way that getting the absolute x,y coordinates of a touch event on a MacBook trackpad is possible via HTMLJavascriptp

Negative 64956 pIm playing with different asynchronous HTTP servers to see how they can handle multiple simultaneous connections. To force a timeconsuming IO operation I use the codepgsleepcode PostgreSQL function to emulate a timeconsuming database query. Here is for instance what I did with Node.jsp  precodevar http  requirehttp var pg  requirepg var conString  postgresalallocalhostal  SQL query that takes a long time to complete  var slowQuery  SELECT 42 as number, pgsleep0.300  var server  http.createServerfunctionreq, res    pg.connectconString, functionerr, client, done      client.queryslowQuery, [], functionerr, result        done       res.writeHead200, contenttype textplain       res.endResult   result.rows[0].number           console.logServe http127.0.0.13001 server.listen3001 codepre  pSo this a very simple request handler that does an SQL query taking 300ms and returns a response. When I try benchmarking it I get the following resultsp  precode ab n 20 c 10 http127.0.0.13001 Time taken for tests   0.678 seconds Complete requests      20 Requests per second    29.49 [sec] mean Time per request       339.116 [ms] mean codepre  pThis shows clearly that requests are executed in parallel. Each request takes 300ms to complete and because we have 2 batches of 10 requests executed in parallel, it takes 600ms overall.p  pNow Im trying to do the same with Elixir, since I heard it does asynchronous IO transparently. Here is my naive approachp  precodedefmodule Toto do   import Plug.Conn    def initoptions do     ok, pid  Postgrex.Connection.startlink       username al, password al, database al     options  [pid pid]   end    def callconn, opts do     sql  SELECT 42, pgsleep0.300     result  Postgrex.Connection.queryopts[pid], sql, []     [value, ]  result.rows     conn     gt putrespcontenttypetextplain     gt sendresp200, Result value   end end codepre  pIn case that might relevant, here is my supervisorp  precodedefmodule Toto.Supervisor do   use Application    def starttype, args do     import Supervisor.Spec, warn false      children  [       workerPlug.Adapters.Cowboy, [Toto, []], function http,     ]     opts  [strategy oneforone, name Toto.Supervisor]     Supervisor.startlinkchildren, opts   end end codepre  pAs you might expect, this doesnt give me the expected resultp  precode ab n 20 c 10 http127.0.0.14000 Time taken for tests   6.056 seconds Requests per second    3.30 [sec] mean Time per request       3028.038 [ms] mean codepre  pIt looks like theres no parallelism, requests are handled one after the other.

Also, when creating the hierarchical structure with a lot of LINQs code.ToDictionarycode method the keys Country, Province etc. of the resp. dictionaries will be much more efficient.p  pHowever, one of the drawbacks aside a slight loss of performance, which is not problem of using codestring.Interncode is that the strings a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.string.intern.aspx relnofollowwont be garbage collected anymorea. But when Im done with my data I emdoem want all that stuff garbage collected eventually.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma555979215042I emcouldem use a codeDictionaryltstring, stringgtcode to intern this dataa but I dont like the overhead of having a codekeycode and codevaluecode where I am, actually, only interested in the codekeycode. I could set the codevaluecode to codenullcode or the use the same string as value which will result in the same reference in codekeycode and codevaluecode.

Code maintainability is high on my list.li ul  pThis is more of a theoretical question its purely out of curiosity  interest that Im asking. There is no emrealem problem, but I emcanem see that in similar situations this emmightem be a problem to someone.p  hr  pFor example I could do something like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class StringInterningObject      private HashSetltstringgt items      public StringInterningObject              items  new HashSetltstringgt           public string Addstring value              if items.Addvalue             return value  New item added return value since it wasnt in the HashSet         MEH... this will quickly go On         return items.Firsti gt i.Equalsvalue Find and return actual item from the HashSet and return it       codepre  pBut with a large set of to be deduplicated strings this will quickly bog down. I could have a peek at the a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.comSystem.CoreSystemCollectionsGenericHashSet.cs relnofollowreference source for HashSeta or a hrefhttpsgithub.comdotnetcoreclrtreemastersrcmscorlibsrcSystemCollectionsGeneric relnofollowDictionarya or... and build a similar class that doesnt return bool for the codeAddcode method but the actual string found in the internalsbucket.p  pThe best I could come up with until now is something likep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class StringInterningObject      private ConcurrentDictionaryltstring, stringgt items      public StringInterningObject              items  new ConcurrentDictionaryltstring, stringgt           public string Addstring value              return items.AddOrUpdatevalue, value, v, i gt i       codepre  pWhich has the penalty of having a Key emandem a Value where Im actually only interested in the Key.

Negative 64956 pWhen building a c project in Visual Studio 2008 in this case, the compiler checks for each source file if there is already an .obj file and only rebuilds the .obj file if any of the input files, which are headers and a source file, are newer than the .obj. p  pThis fails if any of the input files are symlinks because Visual Studio doesnt follow symlinks and only looks at the change date of the symlink itself.p  pE.g. codeTest.cpp symlink 1530code points to code..CommonSourceTest.cpp changed 1638code should produce  codeTest.obj changed 1531code. Unfortunately VS wont follow symlinks and doesnt see that the original file was updated.p  pGNU make and gcc can follow symlinks, is there an equivalent in Visual Studio or is there another option for Windows The change date of a symlink should also reflect the change date of the original file, IMHO, since a symlink cant be changed in Windows anyway.p
Negative 64956 pI am working on standardizing a legacy code base and new development to both use EntityManager for persistence.  In order to succeed however, I need to provide the ability to break out into native SQL and process results manually.  JPA EntityManager almost provides this functionality throughp  precodeem.createNativeQueryselect ... from mytable where ... codepre  pBut what I am missing is the ability to do Spring style RowMappers.  I can see that there are a few mechanisms that are close.  I can ofcourse map entities using annotations, xml and so on but I need to put code into the processing of each row in the result set so this is not an option.  I can see that I can pass in SQLResultSetMapping, but as best as I can understand, this supports again only meta data mapping.  Ideally what I need is the followingp  precodeem.createNativeQueryselect ... from mytable where ...,     new RowMapper        public Object mapRowResultSet rs, int rowNum throws SQLException             MyObject o  new MyObject            o.setMyCustomProperty rs.get...             ...            return b                 codepre  pDoes the equivalent to the above exist  Can I construct a SQLResultSetMapping which takes full control of the mapping like the above.  p  pIf not, can I at least get the data source underlying the EM in a standard way so that I can wrap it using JdbcTemplate and not have two paths to configure datasourcesp  precodeDataSource ds  em.getDataSource   JdbcTemplate t  new JdbcTemplateds   codepre  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 64956 pWhats the least painful way to get my git repository into the state I need it for our Visual Studio projectp  pIn Visual Studio terms, we started with a Web Site Project. The current production version of the site is mostly an old branch of that Web Site Project aside from a few critical fixes that have been made to production.p  pWe brought in some contractors to add a new feature to the site, and they took our code and imported it into a new Web Application Project, and then they updated files and sent us a pull request.  Because the file paths were so different and a few other changes were rather painful, I converted the dev branch of our Web Site Project into a Web Application Project, relocated files to match the new paths, and then merged their changes in, manually fixing all the merge conflicts between their emnewem Web Application Project and our emconvertedem Web Application Project and if you have never manually fixed merge conflicts in a Visual Studio projects XML configuration files, consider yourself lucky.p  pSo if you picture our git repo, there are now two branches in question dev, which has become a Web Application Project, and prod, which is still a Web Site Project, and which is emslightlyem out of sync with the actual production site for  reasons.p  pThe client hasnt approved the changes in dev, and isnt likely to approve them any time soon they do, however, need a critical change made to production that unlike previous hotfix changes to production is of large enough scope that it needs to run through a full devqaapproval process.p  pThere are, at this point, advantages to having the whole site be a Web Application Project advantages that werent relevant when the site was created as a Web Site Project and checked into git in the first place. Whats my best plan of attack for git, that wont result in a broken project in Visual Studio but will get me to a emnewem or emrevertedem dev branch that is both a Web Application Project and consistent with the actual state of productionp  pI know its probably going to involve at least one new branch to handle the merge between production code and the dev branchs Web Application Project structure, but I dont know where to start.

Negative 64956 pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am writing a javascript library. Some functions append quite a bunch of elements to the document. Im choosing not to style these all individually through javascript since its using up a lot of execution time. Instead, I will give all appended elements one or more specific classnames or ids difference doesnt matter in this context and then define the style in a pregenerated stylesheet.p  pThis practice could induce collisions in classid naming. Imagine a user of the library already having defined a foo in another stylesheet or a .bar getting defined in a javascript from another library.p  pA solution to this would be to prefix classnames to minimize the chance of a collision. Although this doesnt reduce the chances of it happening to 0. Would there be another method of avoiding this through javascriptp

Negative 64956 pI have a few issues concerning the recent addition of Swift 2.0 and upcoming iOS9.p  pCurrently I have been working on an app that works with iOS7 or above, and using Swift 1.2 things...nothing that Swift 2 has.  I was told that I should start updating everything to include Swift 2 rather than the older ways of using Swift.  So my questions are...p  p1  If I do begin to work with Swift 2 code, will iOS 7 and iOS 8 be able to recognize that code, or does Swift 2 only work with certain versions of iOSp  p2  If I choose NOT to work with the Swift 2 code and stick with what I have that works already for iOS 7 and 8, is it possible that in iOS9 or later, it wont work because it expects Swift 2 and its not getting itp  pI have looked for compatibility articles and answers online and found nothing.  The only thing Ive learned is that Swift 2 just adds code, and doesnt necessarily change anything...so maybe just keeping my old code would be okay.  But again Im not exactly sure.  Thanks.p

Negative 64956 pIs it possible to desaturate a codeggplotcode easily p  hr  pIn principle, there could be two possible strategies.br First, apply some function to a codeggplotcode object or, possibly, codeGrobcode object to desaturate all colors. Second, some trick to print codeggplotcode desaturated while rendering a code.rmdcode file. Both strategies would be ok for me, but first one is, of course, more promissing.br Creating codeggplotcode in greys from the beginning is not a good option as the idea is to have the same plot as if it was printed in shades of grey.   p  hr  pThere were some similar questions and remarkably good answers on how to perform desaturation in R. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26314701rreducingcoloursaturationofacolourpalette2632259326322593Herea is a convenient way to desaturate color palette. And a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31800687howtogetapixelmatrixfromgrayscaleimageinr3180456131804561herea is the way of desaturating a raster image. What Im looking for, is a simple way of desaturating the whole codeggplotcode. p

Negative 64956 pOK here is my situation. I have an address book type page lets call it addressbook.asp for an example, on this page new rows of addresses are added every so often, this page also has a search function that can search through an address table and narrow the view. My application also has another topframe.asp page that is the same for every page. p  pWhat Im trying to do is implement a notification system. I want to input the address info I want and when an address record is inputted into my address table on addressbook.asp that matches Ill get a pop up notification. The tricky part is I want this notification check running regardless of what page Im on so I will be putting that function into topframe.asp. When a match is made, topframe.asp will create a pop up window saying there is a match and it will have a link back to addressbook.asp. p  pWhat I need to happen is when this link is clicked, the user is redirected to addressbook.asp and the table showing the addresses are narrowed down by the users search criteria. So I basically need to pass in the users criteria on the redirect through the link into the search form and somehow initiate submit so I can reuse addressbook.asps original search functionality. p  pI was thinking I could use window.opener approach however the page opening the pop up isnt addressbook.asp. Is there a way to use window.opener or is there another function thats similar that will allow me to pass info to a page that is not the pop up windows parentp  pI think the simplified version of this is I need to be able to click my link, the link redirects to addressbook.asp, my table record is passed to the search form and basically search needs to be clicked. p

Here is what I have working  p  precodefunction destroyerarr    var arg2  arguments[1]   var arg3  arguments[2]   var arg4  arguments[3]   var result  arr.filterfunctionarg      if arg  arg2 ampamp arg  arg3 ampamp arg  arg4        return arg           return result  destroyer[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3 codepre  pAnd here is my attempt at iterating through all arguments with a for loop. It is not working and I am struggling to conceptualize what exactly I am pumping through my callback in the arr.filter here p  precodefunction destroyerarr    var result  arr.filterfunctionarg      for var i  1 i lt arguments.length i        if arg  arguments[i]          return arg                  return result  destroyer[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3 codepre  pIs this close to where I need to be or am I way off herep
Negative 64956 pMy installsheild project was working ok, the Build process worked and everything was fine, nothing has changed. A few days ago, when I ran my build script on windows, I got a permissions error whenever I tried to access one of the release files.p  pThe process is this  Im building the release files with a ISWIproject object In my python build script.p  pAt some point on the script, I copy those release files after .Build to a specific folder. This has always worked. But now I cant access one of those release files. Each time I try to access itthe file ends with .msi  I get an error saying I do not have permission to copyaccessuse the file. and than the file is just deleted. the other release file works fine it ends with .exep  pIve used pdb, and froze the script right in that part, and even through windows CMD or explorertried to take ownership  I get an error that I do not have permission to use this file. p  pIts like the file is created with stronger credentials than admin. I cant take ownership or touch it, so copying it is impossible. p  pDid anyone ever encountered this before Im lost.p  pThanks.p

Negative 64956 pIm playing around angular directives with isolated scopes. Ive just faced an interesting situation. When I call a function from the local scope, which changes a scope variable content, this is not affecting the DOM. In my example, I add a new element to the scope.customers list, and this is not triggering the ngRepeat, so this part of the DOM is not affected where the ngRepeat items should be rendered.p  pDirective codep  precodefunction addItem      scope.add         items.push         name New Directive Customer          scope.broadcastrefresh     render  ... return    restrict EA,   scope        datasource ,       add amp,     ,     link link  codepre  pLocal function codep  precodescope.addCustomer  function      counter     scope.customers.push         name New Customer  counter,         street counter   Cedar Point St.           alertscope.customers.length  codepre  pDOM ngRepeat partp  precodeltisolatescopewithcontroller datasourcecustomers addaddCustomergtltisolatescopewithcontrollergt lthr gt ltdivgt     ltulgt         ltli ngrepeatcustomer in customersgtcustomer.nameltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe codealertcode will show that the codescope.customerscode is bigger after every button click, but the ngRepeat wont work on the DOM.p  pThe full code a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit8tUzKbKxK0twJsB6i104 relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedit8tUzKbKxK0twJsB6i104ap  pMy question is that, is this possible to trigger the DOM changes from this kind of directives somehowp  pThanks in advancep
