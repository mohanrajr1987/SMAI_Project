Positive 73110 pWe have a highly scaleable application under construction that rests in various parts throughout the azure cloud. During large scale events in the past, weve had developers hop on to individual azure worker instances and manually monitor the performance of our signalR hubs through performance counters on perfMon. This isnt an ideal situation for a multitude of reasons, primarily that were running close to 120 servers for bigger events or stress tests. p  pWere now looking into rolling our own performance monitoring dashboard and finding a way to extract the data from the signalR performance counters on our azure instances into one central location. From what Ive been able to discover this far, this doesnt seem like an achievable goal but I wanted to shoot the question out there and hope someone else has gone down this path before. p  pSo the question is this Can signalR performance metrics be obtained from remote servers in various locations and storedsent to a central locationp

The information pushed to the pages comes from an Web API to which I upload data created by another system.p  pThe application is run as a cloud service in Azure, using Azure Service Bus as SignalR backplane.p  pNow I would like to test how many simultaneous users the solution can handle given the current size and count of the web role instances. Any ideas about how to do thisp
Positive 73110 pI have fairly simple question regarding SignalR, is it possible that SignalR messages would arrive in an out of sync order. i.e if you send messages A,B,C from server, is it possible that the client might get those messages in an order other than A,B,Cp  pThank you in advancep
Positive 73110 pI am using SignalR with Redis backplane scaleout. Now, the codeMicrosoft.AspNet.SignalR.Rediscode package has a dependency to codeStackExchange.Redis.StrongNamecode.p  pSince I was already using Redis in my application, I have the codeStackExchange.Rediscode package installed.p  pWhen I install codeMicrosoft.AspNet.SignalR.Rediscode and choose not to install the dependency to the strongnamed package for Redis, my application stops working the client doesnt connect to the server  it tries every method of connecting, falling back to codelongPollingcode, but fails.p  pThe strange thing is that if I install codeStackExchange.Redis.StrongNamecode at this point I have both the strongnamed version and the normal one  so I have duplicate identifiers for every type from Redis  I uninstall the strongnamed package and everything starts working. even if the strongnamed package doesnt have any dependencies.p  pMy question  does the strongnamed package contain some specific stuff that SignalR uses and why does the application work after removing itp  pThanksp

Positive 73110 pWe have a Web Application that wants to make use of SignalRWebsockets in Asp.NET MVC.

Positive 73110 pI have written a simple analytics tracking tool for my site, which has boolean columns such asp  pcodeVisitedStorecode codeVisitedHomepagecode codeCheckoutStartedcode codeMainVideoPlayedcode  codeMainVideoCompletedcodep  pI am also using Google Analytics but wanted a secondary place to montor activity.p  hr  pI had been testing my application primarily in Chrome which of course will use  web sockets by default. I switched to long polling because I wanted to be able to monitor the requests in Fiddler.p  pThe way the hub works is pretty simple. The SignalR client sends events which sets flags columns when a particular event has completed. So on invocation it does the following p  ul liFind row for user  or create if non existentli liSet flagsli liSave rowli ul  pI had no concurrency issues until I switched to long polling  when I found instant deadlocks.p  pMy client will often send multiple events simultaneously separate issue to fix  yes and when using web sockets they are nicely queued and executed one by one. So obviously any deadlocks are going to be extremely unlikely.p  pLong polling is a different story  I suddenly found that my hub method was being entered multiple times and trying to create multiple rows, and deadlocks and row modified errors all over the place.p  pOne simple solution is just to codelocklockObjcode when making a request, but if I have many clients Id rather not do that. Another is to catch the deadlock and reexecute the request which right now occurs on just about every page load.p  pIs there perhaps a way to configure SignalR long polling to strongnotstrong send requests all at once Or some other way to execute requests in turn like ASP.NET does when you use SessionState.p
Positive 73110 pI have several websites which implements signalR. All works well.p  pNow I added a new site.

I open another client another web site which connects to the same signalR service and I can see the message rates is much faster and of course with data.p  pAny idea what could be the issuep  pKind regards.p

Negative 73110 pIm looking for some advice. I recently wrapped up a project where I inherited some terrible code. I got the application running but its safe to say there are a number of performance and design issues, specifically with the advanced search functionality. I have now been asked to do a very similar project but much larger in scale. I have an opportunity here to build a much better domain model from scratch and create a much better application as a whole. The question is what would be the best way to implement the advanced searchp  pThe advanced search page brings up a form with two required text fields, 4 optional dropdown lists, and two separate areas with multiple optional checkboxes to filter the results even further.p  pThe current solution uses the two required fields to return a List of objects that I then filter and eliminate based on any optional form values. I then throw the filtered List into the cache and attach the users session id. Then on each results page, I have an Html.Helper that displays paging links that use the Take.Skip approach on the List retrieved from the cache to display 10 results.p  pThe issue Im having is that the list can get pretty beefy. Im trying to save database calls for every new page of results by putting it in the cache but Im not sure if thats the best way to approach this. Should I just put all the form values in a monster query string and keep making database calls from the GET requests Should I save the users search criteria in a database or session and use those for every new page of results Am I right with using the cache to hold such a beefy collectionp  pI asked a question similar to this here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1663616pagingsearchresultswithaspnetmvchttpstackoverflow.comquestions1663616pagingsearchresultswithaspnetmvca that led me to using the cache.

I cant perform a fetchrequest directly on the listItem objects because theres no way to say Where List  xxxxx, so I had something like the followingp  precode  NSFetchedResultsController getListItems       Init a fetch request     NSFetchRequest fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]     NSEntityDescription entity  [NSEntityDescription entityForNameList inManagedObjectContextself.managedObjectContext]     [fetchRequest setEntityentity]      NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptor  [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKeylistItem.productName ascendingYES selectornil]     NSArray descriptors  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsortDescriptor]     [fetchRequest setSortDescriptorsdescriptors]        Init the fetched results controller     NSError error     self.globalFetchedResultsController  [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequestfetchRequest managedObjectContextself.managedObjectContext sectionNameKeyPathlistItem.productName cacheNamelistItems]     self.globalFetchedResultsController.delegate  self     if [[self globalFetchedResultsController] performFetcherror]NSLogError , [error localizedDescription]      [fetchRequest release]     [sortDescriptor release]      return self.globalFetchedResultsController  codepre  pNow, this errors because its saying I cant use a onetomany relationship in the sort descriptor  but it also requires that I have a sort descriptor, so Im not sure the correct way to be doing this. Any help would be great.p
Negative 73110 pI was recently given a heap of programs to maintain and I am trying to find some help in adopting some best practices. They are essentially three independant softwares which use a common DLL to manage a series of settings the apps all share. The DLL works this way it swaps the user settings file XML file buried deep in the users configurations folder in Windows, with a fix file, specified by a hardcoded egad path. p  pThe rationale behind keeping it as stronguser settingsstrong and not app settings is that the DLL can be found in several locations one for each app that will use it, and so the user settings file is common if all copies of the DLL are the same compile, whereas by using strongapplication settingsstrong there would be as many app.config files as there are copies of the DLL.p  pIm trying to conceive of a better way to centralise these configurations and end the senseless file swapping. One approach actually, most likely the best approach would be to redesign all 3 apps so they all use a central dll with its own app.config. Are there other more recommendable venuesp

Negative 73110 pI have a Java web application that uses a plugin architecture. I would like to know if anyone has a solution where by one could add a servlet, with serlvet mapping to the servletconfig while the web app is running The idea being that a class could be added to the WEBINFclasses folder and be made active as a servlet without restarting the web app. By the same nature, if the user chooses to remove the plugin then have the code remove the class from the the servletconfig.p

Negative 73110 pI am working on a WPF application similar to visio.  I would like to be able to logically group some of the items in my diagram, each of which is a UIElement, and control certain behaviors i.e. visibility at the group level.  p  pMy first attempt at this was to create a control, called a Group, which had width amp height  0.  I wanted to assign to my diagram elements a specific Group through their group property, and then bind certain UIElement properties to the group value, as belowp  precodeltDiagramNode            Width300 Height300           VisibilityBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Self,PathGroup.Visibility          gt ... ltDiagramNode gt codepre  pAlthough this does not throw a binding error, it also doesnt work.  Changing the Visibility of the group has no affect on the visibility of the nodes assigned to that group.  No errors appear at anytime as far as i can tell, it just doesnt work.p  pAny ideas  Is my approach possible  If no, any one have alternatives theyd like to suggest .  Im not a huge UI guy, feel much more comfortable in a service layer, so Im open to other suggestions.p

Negative 73110 pIf I make multiple HTTP Get Requests to the same server and get HTTP 200 OK responses to each one how do I tell which request maps to which response using Wiresharkp  pCurrently it looks like an http request is made, and the next HTTP 200 OK response is quickly received so everything is in a the proper sequence.  I have seen things to the contrary however. For example using the Google Maps API v2 Ive made several requests for location information and then the information is received in an arbitrary order closely resembling the order in which I requested it, but not necessarily perfect.p  pSo my intuition is I cannot assume that my responses will be received in a specific order, even though they may be in order most of the time.  So Im wondering how I can determine this order from the response.p  pUpdate Clarification as to what I need.  I just need to know that the server has received the request.  It seems like I need to do this by looking at sequence numbers and perhaps even ACKS.  The reasoning behind this approach is Im basically observing a web app and checking it is sending the information and the information is being received.p  pUpdate This has nothing to do with wireshark specifically.  I believe it is confusing people so I removing it from the title.  It has to do with the HTTP protocol on top of the TCPIP protocol and how we map responses to requests.p  pThanks.p

Negative 73110 pSuppose you have a set of nodes connected into a tree structure with one root node and any node may have any number of child nodes.p  pYou can only traverse the tree starting at the root node or from your current position along direct connections. I.e., no random access to a specific node, but the structure of the graph is already known and fits in memory.p  pEach node has a strongmustrevisit timestrong which is not revealed to you. The mustrevisit time is calculated [where emiem  time interval since last visit] as strongnow  a  emiemb  emiemc2strong. The parameters a, b and c have different values for each node but each will always generally be within the same order of magnitude across different nodes.p  pIf you revisit a node past after its mustrevisit time has passed it will reset so that the mustrevisit time after that visit is calculated as now  a per the formula above. If you traverse to a node it will be revealed to you whether you have past the mustrevisit time or not, but you will not know what it was or what the values or a, b or c are.p  pYour goal is to choose a strategy to traverse to and revisit each node in the tree over time so that no node is past its mustrevisit time and strongminimize the number of traversal operationsstrong overall. Revisiting a node too early is inefficient, but revisiting a node past its mustrevisit time is highly inefficient. Ideally you want to hit each node just before its mustrevisit time or if you need to in order to traverse to another node.p
Negative 73110 pI am curious what the preferred way to structure an application with an executable client program, an executable server program and a shared model in solutions and projects using Visual Studio and C. Being used to Java development I initially regarded projects as packages and defined a project for each package I designed.p  pThis resulted in a sixproject solution one for the model, one for the server and four for the client which in turn resulted in some silly dependencies causing me to reconsider if this is the best approach.p  pNow, I am planning to restructure the solution to three projects total a client project, a sever project and a model project. Both the client and the server will be dependent on the model project in which I will also add the shared interface between client and sever. p  pIs this the best way to structure such an application p  pAlso, what is the best way to reflect namespaces within the tree structure of Visual Studio Just creating a similar folder structure for instance.p

Negative 73110 pWeb server log analyzers e.g. Urchin often display a number of sessions. A session is defined as a series of page visits  clicks made by an individual within a limited, continuous time segment. The attempt is made to identify these segments using IP addresses, and often supplementary info like user agent and OS, along with a session timeout threshold such as 15 or 30 minutes.p  pFor certain web sites and applications, a user can be logged in andor tracked with a cookie, which means the server can precisely know when a session begins.

Negative 73110 pIm a newbie and just start to learn Google Android right nowp  pSo I learn some code after I googled, but I dont know why it cant run well as wished. These program consists of two java files, AlarmService.java which contains an activity named AlarmService, and AlarmServiceService.java which contains a service named AlarmServiceService.

Nothing happen when I clicked the button, not even the Toast, and I saw this message in LogCatp  blockquote   pUnable to start service Intent flg0x4 cmpcom.AlarmService.AlarmServiceService has extras  not foundp blockquote  pHonestly, Im not familiar with Android so I keep wondering what is wrong with this code.

Negative 73110 pI have used codeDate.prototypecode in my WSHJScripts to do some date calculations. I would like to include these functions in WSHVBS as well. Basically, mixing JS and VBS code and including JS files in a VBS script works in WSF files.p  pBut I cant get the extended codeDatecode object to work in VBS. I suppose that is because there is no equivalent codeDatecode object in VBS, and dates are handled in another way in VBS. p  pReimplementing my date functions in VBS seems to be a bad idea as long as I dont know for sure that there is no other way. It could be possible to write simple JS wrappers in the VBS script which sort of forward to the codeDatecode objects functions.p  pIf there is any other idea, Id be very happy to see it.p

Negative 73110 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3514740howtosplitanarrayintoagroupofnelementseachHow to split an array into a group of n elements eacha  p blockquote    pI believe I oversimplified this question so I am editing it a bit. From within a .NET 3.5 console application I have a SortedList string,string that will contain an unknown number of keyvalue pairs. I will get this collection by reading in rows from a table within a Microsoft Word document. The user will then be able to add additional items into this collection. Once the user has finished adding to the collection I then need to write the collection back to a new Microsoft Word document. The difficulty is that the items must be written back to the document in alphabetical order to a multicolumn table, first down the left side of the table and then down the right side of the table and since the output will likely be spread across multiple pages I need to also keep the order across multiple pages. So the first table on the first page may contain A through C on the left side of the table and C through F on the right side of the table then if the table exceeds the page a new table is needed. The new table may contain F through I and the right side L through O.Since the table will likely span multiple pages and I know the maximum number of rows per table per page I can do the math to determine how many tables I will need overall. This image is representative of the output img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commU5k1.png alttable outputbr For the sake of brevity if a output table can contain a maximum of 7 rows per page and 2 items per row and I have 28 items then I will need to write the output to 2 tables but of course I wont really know how many tables I will need until I read in the data so I cant simply hardcode the number of output tables.p  pWhat is the best way to take my SortedList and split it out into n collections in order to create the table structure describedp
Negative 73110 pI am working on creating plugandplay software for cameras behind a firewall. To do that, the camera has a command that tells it to connect to a server of mine over http, in which I can talk to it in http.p  pI need to export this connection to users, so that when I get http requests, I forward them directly to the camera, and forward the responses back to the user.p  pMy initial idea was just to use tcp  get the camera connection using tcp, and continuously wait for user connections. When I get a user connection  I forward everything from it to the camera, and from the camera to it. In other words  plain old port redirection.p  pThe problem begins when the user needs to have several active connections to the camera. I hoped this would not be an issue  but I have found out or at least thats what I think happens that browsers actually open several connections to the same site to download files.p  pNow I have no choice but to write code that actually reads the http request, dispatches it to the camera, waits for the cameras response, and sends it back.  That is the only way to allow multiple connections to the same camera using just one connection as far as I can see.p  pMy question is  is there any existing code to do this Libraries Software Or is there any better way to do what Im trying to dop  pEDIT Well, apparently I was wrong about the browser creating several connections to the server. What actually happens is that the server returns HTTP 1.0 responses, and as I have found out, HTTP 1.0 allows a single request and response per connection. What I was seeing is the browser just leaving the used connection it has opened earlier open, and opening a new one for a new request.p  pHowever, I still had to do HTTP message forwarding myself I only implemented texthtml, textplain and some other custom content type which is used by the camera. So for instance, the browser doesnt show pictures at all. So if anyone knows about any code that does http message forwarding or an application that does it, I would love to hear it.p  pAs a side note  I have checked the proxy feature of httpd apache. Not only is it very complicated, it also seems to allow only one proxy connection on the machine. So I abandoned that direction and implemented basic forwarding myself.p  pThanksp

Negative 73110 pOk so I might just be missing something but I am trying to make a hex board map, like in civilizations. The idea is to have each hex as an object that has various propertiesie, color, type, etc. Then have a board of all these various hexes. There would be 3 board types, rectangle, circle, triangle. p  pThe issue I am having is how to represent each hex in a data type. I figured a 2 dimensional array would be the way to go, which would be fine if I just needed to know the hex locations themselves. But I will need to know the vertexes and edges of each hex so that I can do things like on the edge between these to hexes add this. That is what is confusing me.

Negative 73110 pI have created a search bar on GAE similar to facebook that shows you  names and pictures as you type into a search bar.  e.g. typing jo  would bring up a drop down of John Smith and Michael Jordan.

Can someone explain what is going on here.

Negative 73110 pI would like some advice on a technique I bumped onto.  It can be easily understood by looking at the code snippets, but I document it somewhat more in the following paragraphs.p  hr  pUsing the Code Sandwich idiom is commonplace to deal with resource management.  Used to Cs RAII idiom, I switched to Java and found my exceptionsafe resource management resulting in deeply nested code, in which I have a really hard time getting grip on the emregularem control flow.p  pApparently a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq19388936610java data access is this good style of java data access code, or is it too much try finallya, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq26992096610Java io ugly tryfinally blocka and many more Im not alone.p  pI tried different solutions to cope with this p  ol lipmaintain the program state explicitly coderesource1aquiredcode, codefileopenedcode..., and cleanup conditionally codeif resource1acquired resource1.cleanupcode...  But I shun duplicating the program state in explicit variables  the runtime knows the state, and I dont want to care for it.pli lipwrap every nested block in functions  results in even harder to follow control flow, and makes for really awkward function names coderunResource1Acquired r1 code, coderunFileOpened r1, file code, ...pli ol  pAnd finally I arrived at an idiom also conceptually backed by some a hrefhttpwww.cs.wisc.edutechreports2008TR1647.pdfresearch paper on code sandwichesap  hr  pInstead of thisp  precode pseudocode try     connection  DBusConnection.SessionBus  may throw, needs cleanup    try          exported  false         connection.exportMyObject, myObject   may throw, needs cleanup         exported  true             ... more tryfinally nested blocks      finally          if exported  connection.unExport MyObject           finally     if connection  null  connection.disconnect  codepre  pUsing a helper construction, you may arrive at a more linear construct, in which compensation code is right next to the originator.p  precodeclass Compensation       public void compensate  compensations  new StackltCompensationgt codepre  pAnd the nested code becomes linearp  precodetry      connection  DBusConnection.SessionBus  may throw, needs cleanup     compensations.push new Compensation public void compensate          connection.disconnect           connection.exportMyObject, myObject   may throw, needs cleanup     compensations.push new Compensation public void compensate          connection.unExport MyObject                unfolded tryfinally code   finally      while compensations.empty          compensations.pop.compensate  codepre  pI was delighted no matter how many exceptional paths, the control flow stays linear, and the cleanup code is visually next to the originating code.  On top of that, it doesnt need an artificially restricted codecloseQuietlycode method, which makes it more flexible i.e. not only codeCloseablecode objects, but also codeDisconnectablecode, codeRollbackablecode and whatever others.p  pBut...p  pI found no mention of this technique elsewhere.

Negative 73110 pI am working with the application, which has JSF2 framework.

Negative 73110 pOur main application interface is a website written in ASP.NET Webforms. For the most part, all htmlcontent is generated server side, with some javascriptAJAX sprinkled in where necessary.p  pManagement has decided to move new development in a different direction. No content will be generated server side. Instead, we will only expose WCF web services which return very simple JSON objects that contain UI data munged together from business objects.p  pAll of our actual pages will contain a small amount of html, and scripts which will pull the data from the services asynchronously to populate JQuery UI elements.p  pI dont really have an issue with this, and I can see where it nicely decouples the presentation layer from the data. But Im not sure exactly what to call this Weve clearly split off the View from everything else, but I dont think the above strictly qualifies as MVC, depending on how the backend is implemented. Would it be called a service oriented architecture Ive heard that term thrown around a few times.p  pAre there any major downfalls to doing things this wayp

Negative 73110 pWe have a Windows Forms app that loads various forms as Tab Pages. Forms are stored in various DLLs which are stored on companys intranet website. The App Launcher uses reflection to load DLL from the URL and then opens a particular requested Class Windows Form and displays in the Tab Page Interface. When we do any upgrade to the Forms we just copy the DLLs to the intranet website folder and the Launcher then pulls the latest version. p  pEverything has been running smoothly for last 67 years until IE9 was launched. In IE 9 they have redone the caching module. As a result our DLLs pulled with reflection code get cached forever. We can no longer do upgrades by just replacing the DLL file hoping reflection core will download the latest DLL by looking at file date or size. Caching is good so long as it updates the cache when the source changes. p  pWe are facing major problems as customers have to delete their IE9 cache or sometimes we have to go to their desk and delete UsersAppData[cryptic folders].p  pUpdate Here is the reflection code we usep  precodeAssembly RemoteAssembly RemoteAssembly  Assembly.LoadFromassemblyURL return RemoteAssembly.CreateInstancetypeName codepre

Negative 73110 pThe building process of the current application Im working on.

For development you can use   your Mac as the server which well do in this tutorial but for   production use, you need at least something like a VPS Virtual   Private Server. A cheap shared hosting account is not good enough.   You need to be able to run a background process on the server, install   an SSL certificate, and be able to make outgoing TLS connections on   certain ports. Most shared hosting providers do not let you do this,   although they might if you ask. However, I really recommend using a   VPS host such as Linode.p blockquote  pAt last I think I do need a VPS.

Negative 73110 pI actually cant believe Im saying this but since porting my programs to OSX and getting used to permissions, Ive realized that what I planned to do on Windows will not work how I want it to. Currently, on windows, my program stores its settings in the registry HKLM and some user editable resources in a folder next to the program file. For various reasons, I have now decided that the configurationsettings will be stored in a file and the user will be able to in which folder the other resources are kept.p  pSo the question I have now is where to store the configuration file. Obviously it will be updated, but I dont want to program to have to require administrator permissions to run. I would like to offer an option so that all users can use the program like most programs do, which will of course require Admin, so this leads be onto the second query where should I store the configuration file and the folder in which other resources are kept and how can I detect whether the program has been installed for all users or just onep  pThanks in advancep  pPS If you didnt guess, the program is written in Java so I would like to know how to programatically get the location you suggest as well please.p

Negative 73110 pIve had far too many meetings today, but I think I still have my brainware in place. In my effort to improve the performance of some query I came across the following mystery table names and fields paraphrasedp  precodeSELECT X.ADId FROM      SELECT DISTINCT A.ADId     FROM P WITH NOLOCK     INNER JOIN A WITH NOLOCK ON P.ID  A.PId     INNER JOIN dbo.fnA16 AS VD ON VD.DId  A.ADId     LEFT JOIN DPR ON LDID  A.ADId     WHERE A.ADId  1 OR HDId IS NOT NULL AND HDId  1 AND            P.PS NOT IN5,7 AND A.ASP IN 2, 3  X WHERE dbo.fnBX.ADId, 16  1 codepre  pAs you will see, the contents of the inner query are mostly irrelevant. The whole point initially was that I wanted to avoid getting fnB called on every record cause they contained duplicate values for ADId, so I did a SELECT DISTINCT internally then filter the distinct records. Sounds reasonable rightp  pHere starts the mystery...p  pThe inner query returns NO RECORDS for the specified parameters. If I comment out the WHERE fnB  1 then the query runs in zero time and returns no results. If I put it back on, then the query takes 610 seconds, again returning no results.p  pThis seems to beat common sense, or at least MY common SQL sense  If the inner query returns no data, then the outer conditions should never get evaluated rightp  pOf course I took the time to check the actual execution plans, saved them and compared them very carefully. They are 99 identical, with nothing unusual to notice, or so I think.p  pI fooled around with some CTEs to get the query results in the first CTE, and then pass it to a second CTE that had some conditions guaranteed to filter no records, then evaluate the fnB call outside all CTEs, but the behavior was exactly the same.p  pAlso other variations, like using the old query that might call fnB multiple times with the same value had the same behavior. If I remove the condition then I get no records in zero time. If I put it back, then no records in 10 seconds.p  pAny ideas anyonep  pThanks for your time p  pPS1 I tried to reproduce the situation on tempdb using a simple query but I couldnt make it happen. It only happens on my actual tables. PS2 This query is called inside another function so putting the results in a temporary table and then further filtering them is also out of the question.p

Negative 73110 pWe have a web application hosted on this webLogic server on a UNIX machine. Its primarily a JSPServlet based app. Whenever we do a modificationenhancemment to any one of those JSps or servlets, I precompile them on my local and deploy them on the UNIX system. For example, if there is a file called GetIdServlet.class, we usually rename the existing file to say GetIdServlet.class1 and then put in the new file as GetIdServlet.class. This is just to be able to revert back to the original file in case they are needed.  However, I notice very strange behaviour. The application loses some functionality whenever we stop and start the server. The functionality may be  back on the next or a few restarts after that. For example, a submit button that is supposed to direct it to the next page just stops working. It may start working after a few restart. p  pHowever on my localEclipse  webLogic there is absolutely no issue. Everything works fine. Any ideas on whats going wrong p

When I execute it outside the debugger, it throws an exception with the following messagep  precodeSystem.Security.SecurityException ECall methods must be packaged into a system module. codepre  pIt appears the exception is thrown when the JIT compiler compiles the method as opposed to when if codeInternalMethodcode is called. Is there anything I can do e.g. attributes to tell the CLI to either not throw the codeSecurityExceptioncode, or delay the exception until the method is actually calledp  pSide note on the use case The codeSpecialCasecode field is effectively false when running with Microsoft .NET Framework, and true when running under a different specific implementation of the CLI. When running under the Microsoft .NET Framework, the call to codeInternalMethodcode is effectively unreachable.p

Negative 73110 pIve found something very strange and Im quite amazed, I wonder if someone has found it before or could imagine whats hapenning.p  pI have an ASP.NET MVC3 chess application. Now Im developing a lobby for users to join and send match invites to others.p  pUsers on the lobby are tracked through a class that is contained on HttpContext.Application, when a user access to lobbys url is added to the list of users and when he leaves the page an AJAX strongsynchronousstrong call, fired from onUnload event, is made to remove him from the list.p  pWhile on the page, a javascript code periodically asks server for the list of current users and updates it on client page.p  pNow, all of this works quite well, but when I reload the lobby page Im seeing that the logged user is dissapearing from the list. Ive checked the execution and seen that when refreshing the page, the controller that loads the lobby fires before the AJAX call that removes the user, so the controller first try to add the user to the list but as hes already on it he isnt added and just later hes removed.p  pI suposed that when refreshing, the onUnload event would execute and, after it returns, the page will be loaded again... however dont seem to be happening on the expected order.p  pAny ideasuggestion Thanks.p

Negative 73110 pRead a lot of differences between codepointerscode amp codereferencescode.p  pHere is a brief description of what i learned.p  pstrong1strong. Memory is allocated when a pointer is defined. A reference however, is a name alias amp hence no memory is allocated for itcodeIs it correctcode.p  pstrong2strong. Reference is bound to be initialized at the time of definition because, a reference is implemented with a constant pointer amp hence cannot be made to point to the other object. A pointer however, is not necessary to be initialized at the time of definition amp hence can also be changed to point to some other object.p  pstrong3strong. A reference automatically gets dereferenced. When you write codecout ltlt pcode It is automatically dereferenced by the compiler amp treated as codecout ltlt pcode by the compiler.p  pHere, p is the reference.p  ol lipA reference to a reference is not possible.Whenever, you declare a reference to a reference, its actually the reference to the same variable. e.g.p  precodeint i     int ampr1i     int ampr2r1 lt2 codepreli ol  pCompiler interprets the statement 2 asbr            int ampr2r1br and r1 is nothing but the variable i itself.p  pA pointer to a pointer is however possible.p  pstrong5strong. Array of pointer is possible while array of references is not possibleWhy.p  pstrong6strong. Address of pointer is possible. Address of reference is not possible. It gives of the address of the variable.p  pstrong7strong. There are situations where you are bound to use references.You cannot use pointers there. Consider the below examplep  pA abcp  pWhere a,b,c are objects of class A. The operator  is overloaded as followsp  precodeconst Aamp operatorconst Aamp o       return Aio.i  codepre  pSee sample code here  a hrefhttpideone.comQ0pE1 relnofollowhttpideone.comQ0pE1a   p  pHere the reference in the argument list is used to save the memory footprints.br You cannot use pointer in the argument list as you are bound to pass the address of object in the operator function.br      A aampb  cbr However, if pointer is used in the parameter list, then we will end up adding the addresses rather than object itself.    p  pstrongI want to know that is there any other point that i am missingstrong    p  pstrongWhen should one go for pointer amp when for referencestrongp

Negative 73110 pI recently created a site on a public host altervista and today i was messing up a bit with it.  I tried including a Java japplet I made on it, and after some try and fix, I managed to do it.  But heres the problem on other PCs it works as intended, no troubles at all, but on mine... its like it ignores the .class files I uploaded on my sites server. Instead, it uses some other .class that i do not have neither in my hard disk nor on the server or, at least, not on the portion thats under my control. Its like, during the early tests, it memorized one of the first packs of .class files i uploaded and then stick with them, no matter what i uploadeddeleted after. What could be the reason behind that At the first moment I tought the server just needed some time but now I no longer think thats the case, because some days have elapsed and on other computers it works correctly. Could it be caused by some specific code structure used into the applet Any help will be much appreciated.p  pedit other info and shorter amp probably better description of what happens on comments below.p

Negative 73110 pI have an iOS app that pulls user data down from a web service and saves it to a sqlite backed core data store.  While this is also going on Im taking the url for the users avatar and saving the image locally into core data as the download of each image becomes available.p  pEach of these are performed on their own thread with their own managed object context but with the same shared persistent store coordinator.p  pWhen there are just a few items being pulled down, this works great, but as we approach 100 items or so I get frequent deadlocks on the initial load of data.  When I pause the debugger I see the different threads usually both waiting on an executeFetchRequest.p  pI turned on the sql debug in my scheme and according to the console output the fetches complete, but the threads never continue.p  pWhat else can I use or look at to examine why these are deadlocking or how I can prevent these deadlocks from occurringp

My understanding is that AdHoc distribution is for testing, meaning that it is strongnotstrong ok to distribute to anyone.  Is it ok to release applications this way to anyone  Does the phrase AdHoc distribution imply testing.  This phrase is confusing.

Negative 73110 pI am designing a database to contain a table codereferencecode, with a column codetypecode that is one of several predefined values e.g., codebookcode, codemoviecode, codemagazinecode, etc.. I intend the range of possible values to expand over time e.g. if I realize that I missed the codeacademicpapercode type, I want to be able to put that in.p  pThe easiest solution would seem to be to simply store a string representing the type into the table. But this sounds like it would result in a lot of wasted space.p  pThe other solution I thought of is creating a new table codereferencetypescode, which the codetypecode column references in its foreign key. This seems to have the added benefit of ensuring valid foreign keys so that I wont accidentally mistype a magzine somewhere in my code, possible allow for faster queries for all media of a certain type since integer comparisons should be much faster than string comparisons, but also slow my application down a bit as joins would be required whenever I need the reference type, and probably complicate logic because of those extra joins.p  pWhat are your thoughts on schema design for this problemp

Negative 73110 pI currently have a task to take Options Symbols and make them easily searchable from a cache for fast lookups from various different applications both web and windows based.  We have settled on making a WFC service to return the results for us.br There are approx 500k records that are needed to cache.  When we do this our memory footprint is approximately 400 MB using a Trie Object. I was instructed to make that smaller.  p  pAn option symbol looks like this in our world codeROOTDATESTRINGPRICETYPEcode or codeIBM130119215.0Ccodep  pSo I was thinking that since there is tons of duplication in this I could build a Trie for each part which when finished made the memory usage approx 30 MB.  p  pSo my dilemma now is how to link them so it still appears as one continuous Trie for searching.  If I do a simple parent child I can end up with false results since the parent of the Price is Date and that could have prices that do not occur for that ROOT or Type.  Our current approach is to use another object that is a linking object similar to a join table in a database.  We have each final node with an UniqueID and then build the appropriate relationship.  This is still very fast and does not take huge amounts of memory but I was wondering what others may suggest as a way to link these items in a more efficient manner.p  pAdditional Info So each part of the option symbol in my current implementation is its own individual Trie. So if I have Options that are IBM130119215.0C APPL130119215.0C APPL130119600.0C A130119310C IBM130119220.0C IBM130119215.0P I would subsequently build a trie for the root like  There is an end value as part of my node structure to know where I have hit an end.p  pre     root          Date                  Price                OptType                                                              A    I           1                  2      3  6           P   C                                                 A  B           3                2   1    1  0                                                  P  M           0                0   5    .  0                                                   L              1                .   .    0  .                                                                   1                0   0    0  0                                           9  pre  pSo without a way to link each of these I could get many false positives by just using Parent Child.  Since the Child of Date is Price. I had thought about putting all the parent child pieces on the Root, making that a special type of NODE so as to not have a bunch of null data out there for others that are not needed.  but we settled on a linking table, however that is not working well at all.  I am not set that this is the right implementation, but we do need to CACHE all of these records due to the number of calls and frequency of them.  p

Negative 73110 pstrongPlease refer to a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxNUKb7 relnofollowthis fiddlea.strongp  pI need the top of the codebluecode div to remain at a fixed distance eg 2em from the bottom of the coderedcode header.  In other words, the codebluecode div should be pushed down when the coderedcode header increases in vertical size ie as a result of the viewport narrowing causing menu items to wrap.p  pI would prefer a CSSonly solution, but if anyone can confirm my feeling that this cant be done by CSS alone then Id also need and appreciate advice as to which jQuery functions I should be hooking, and to which DOM events.p  pstrongNotesstrongp  ul lipThe layout otherwise works asis, except that currently the codebluecode div is effectively vertically positioned by a fixeddistance from the top of the grey codepagecode div.  This means that as the coderedcode header gets taller, coderedcode extends behind the codebluecode div rather than pushing it down.  pli lipThe HTML is constrained, with the exception that the order of the codegreencode and codebluecode divs can be reversed within the codemaincode div.pli lipcodebluecode is positioned relative to the codepagecode, and not by logical flow following the coderedcode header, because of my requirement to position its codegreencode sibling The top of codegreencode emmustem remain positioned by a fixed amount from the top of codepagecode.  p  pIve achieved this rightly or wrongly by making codegreencode positioned relative to the whitebordered codemaincode div within which its horizontal position is achieved, and codemaincode is in turn positioned absolutely within codepagecode to achieve the fixed vertical position.p  pThis of course has an effect on the position of codebluecode. Im just not sure if theres a way to break out this div away from the other such that its returned to a more normal flow.p  pIm not constrained to this approach for codegreencodes positioning relative to the codepagecode, just so long as the end result for codegreencode is the same and codebluecode moves down as a result of coderedcode wrapping and does so independently of codegreencode.pli ul  pYour time very much appreciatedp  pHTMLp  precodeltbodygt ltdiv idpagegtpage     ltheader idredgt         ltdiv idmenucontainergt             ltul idnavmenugt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt                 ltli classmenuitemgtmenultligt             ltulgt         ltdivgt     ltheadergt     ltdiv idmaingt         ltdiv idbluegtltdivgt         ltdiv idgreengtltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pp  pCSSp  precodebody      arbitrary     backgroundcolor black     padding 0 1em  page      arbitrary     backgroundcolor gray     bordercolorgray     borderwidth1pt     borderstyledotted      necessary  or at least, the achieved result is      maxwidth 1000px     minwidth 240px     margin 0 auto      both blue and green positioned relatively to this div      positionrelative  header      arbitrary     backgroundcolor red      necessary  or at least, the achieved result is      width 100   necessary  or at least, the achieved result is   menucontainer      width 50  ul      liststyle none  .menuitem      margin 0 0.25em 0 0.25em     display inlineblock  main      arbitrary     bordercolorwhite     borderwidth1pt     borderstyledotted      necessary  or at least, the achieved result is      positionabsolute     top .5em     width 100  green      arbitrary     backgroundcolor green     height 15em      necessary  or at least, the achieved result is      zindex 100     width 40     position relative     left 50  blue      arbitrary     backgroundcolor blue     height3em      necessary  or at least, the achieved result is      width100      heres the problem  top of blue currently 5em below top of grey page.

Negative 73110 pI have to implement an architecture where, unfortunately, we are using SharePoint 2013 as, effectively, our principle database. Not my choice, in case you hadnt picked that up. I have an Asp.Net MVC facade application on the server, handling composition of data from SP and a couple of other data sources, and then a JavaScript SPA as client. An additional wrinkle is that the client needs to be able to work offline, so I need to use IndexedDB to store the data for offline access. p  pThis seems a perfect usecase for breeze.js. My basic architecture is to define a strongly typed model in the MVC facade that will wrap the untyped data I get from SP in the form object[property]   using the SP Client Side Object Model. Breeze will handle synchronization between this model and the client, and I will use the exportimport functionality to cache data in IndexedDB as required.p  pSo far so good. But... the SOA examples on the breeze site are still under development and to me, this is fundamentally an SOA architecture, with each SP List a service to be composed. The closest thing I can find is the a hrefhttpwww.breezejs.comsamplesnodb relnofollowNoDBa sample but this hardcodes metadata on the client. Id like to establish relationships and validation in the MVC model, and then pass these through to the client, so validation can run off the same declaration in both places.p  pIs this possible If so  how If not does anyone have a workaround or a better idea Im already resigned to defining the model in two separate places the facade and, implicitly, the structure of the SP lists. I would dearly like to avoid implementing it a third time in the client. Im open to having breeze.js talk directly to the SP REST endpoints, but my understanding from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma153645031014822httpstackoverflow.coma153645031014822a is that the implementation is flawed and does not expose the required metadata.p  pstrongResolutionstrong Based on the accepted answer below, I came to the following solutionp  p1 Generate a service reference from the SP ListData.svc endpoint  thus creating an edmx and proxy classes.p  p2 Extend ContextProvider in my Repository and override codeBuildJsonMetadatacode like sop  precodeprotected override string BuildJsonMetadata      XDocument xDoc  XDocument.LoadHttpContext.Current.Server.MapPathPATHTOEDMX     String xString  xDoc.ToString     xString  xString.ReplaceDATASERVICENAMESPACE, APPNAMESPACE     xDoc  XDocument.ParsexString     var jsonText  CsdlToJsonxDoc     return jsonText  codepre  p3 Modify breeze.js very slightly, editing line 12383p  precodevar schema  metadata.schema  metadata[edmxEdmx][edmxDataServices].schema codepre  pI could presumably also have fixed this in the ContextProvider by choosing a descendant rather than the root node for my xDocp  p4  Optionally use Christoffs very useful a hrefhttpsgithub.comcskeppstedtt4ts relnofollowT4TS.tta template script to generate a d.ts from the service proxy classes so I can have type safety on the data that breeze loads.p  pSo far so good with this setup  I can perform basic CRUD with metadata, backed by SP as a data source.p

Negative 73110 pIm using byte arrays of size 2 or 4 to emulate the effect of codeshortcode and codeintcode data types. Main idea is to have a data type that support both codecharcode and codeintcode types, however it is really hard for me to emulate arithmetic operations in this way, since I must do them in bit level. For those who do not follow  p  pThe codeintcode representation of 123 is not equal to the byte[] of 0,1,2,3 since their bit representations differ 123 representation is code00000000000000000000000001111011code and the representation of 0,1,2,3  is code00000000000000010000001000000011code on my system.p  pSo codeintcode of 123 would actually be equivalent to codebyte[]code of 0,0,0,123. The problems occur when values stretch over several bytes and I try to subtract or decrement from those byte arrays, since then you have to interact with several different bytes and my math isnt that sharp.p  pAny pseudocode or java library suggestions would be welcome.p
Negative 73110 pFairly new to JavaScript so it might be a noobish question.p  pAt the moment for my project Im using NodeJS for my server and Backbone for the client. The client will send a request to the server and the server will send list of files in the server, my aim was to simply return the list of files and when user click on the file it will send another request to the server to load the file.p  pCurrently in the client level my model and collection is defined something likep  precodeapp.MyFile  Backbone.Model.extend     defaults          modifiedDate new Date,         path ,         content   content of the file        var MyFileList  Backbone.Collection.extend   model app.MyFile,   url apifiles    create global collection of files app.MyFiles  new MyFileList  app.AppView  Backbone.View.extend   initialize function        fetch all files     app.MyFileList.fetch       app.js point of entry function     Kick things off by creating the App.   new app.AppView  codepre  pAnd my server codep  precodevar applicationroot  dirname,     express  requireexpress,   ... app.getapifiles, functionreq, res      ...      return file list   app.getapifilesid, functionreq, res      ...      return file content  codepre  pSince it doesnt make sense to load all files in the directory and send it back to the client, what I did was I created the model in the server and fill up codemodifiedDatecode and codepathcode while leaving codecontentcode to codenullcode. But the problem now is that how do I fill up the codecontentcode when user clicks on the file Im not sure how to manually send an HTTP request from Backbone View or controller. Or is there any better way of doing this One way that I can think of is to create another model that only keeps codemodifiedDatecode and codepathcode but to me this looks very verbose and repetitive.p

Negative 73110 pI am currently attempting to connect to multiple BLE devices using BlueZ 5.0 and Linux.  I have one host BLE adapter and I have modified the gatttool to connect and perform this function.  If I run an instance of the modified gatttool, I successfully connect and receive notification data from the BLE device.  If I run another instance of the modified gatttool and connect to another BLE device, this application starts receiving notification data from both BLE devices and the initial application no longer receives any data.  I believe this is due to the socket setup, where both applications are configuring their sockets to the same address and PSM the newest instance receives the data whereas the other is starved.  Is there a way to prevent this condition  Ideally, I want one application to connect to multiple devices.  I assume that the application can only have one socket for the reason that multiple sockets will have the same issue as the multiple instances above.  My BLE device is a TI CC2540 keyfob acting as a heartrate monitor.p

There are also other options and it is hard to know what route to take. Apparently XCode can also submit to the Apple store but it seems to work with code directly. Finally there is also Package Maker. p  pAny guidance would be appreciated. p

Negative 73110 pSo after doing some research on writing to an Excel file i have found that both the Apache API and JExcel could cause performance issues. At the moment my application outputs the information i want to a TextArea but i was considering writing to an excel file instead of copying and pasting an option that is built into the application  i have a button that copies to the clipboard to one. My question is  should i include an option to write to an excel file or should i continue to use the copy to clipboard option.p  pThanksp

Negative 73110 pStudent Data Grid that display the student id and a description in the grid. It also has a select button when the user click on it that would route to a javascript function. This function will set some flags on the server side, close the window, past the studentID on a search box and do an automatic search on the studentID. The click appears to be doing exactly what I want it to do.  However, if the user were to double click on a row in the grid, it is supposed to do the exact same thing. it should also do a post. The double click is doing the post twice. What is causing it to do the post twice I have not been able to figure it out. Ive been putting alert all over the place and no success as to why. p  pIn case you may be wondering why I have the dataroute and a client side script.

It goes for about 3 iterations, then does a bunch of function evaluations. I have the function I am trying to minimize display its value when it is called, and I can see that after a few calls on the 4th iteration it is significantly smaller than it was on the third iteration, but Matlab continues to evaluate the function and Im not sure why. Is there something I can adjust to tell it to accept the update and move to the next iteration p

Negative 73110 pI would like to create a web app with tiles to display content where the tiles are fixed widthheight and they wrap horizontally.  Individual tiles can be clicked and then the view changes to display tiles for children of the clicked tile.

Negative 73110 pI want to implement Delta updates, and I have no clue how they work. If anyone could share some information, or tell me where I could find some, I would be very grateful.p  pemA delta update is an update that only requires the user to download the code that has changed, not the whole program. It can significantly save time and bandwidth. The name is drawn from the fact that the Greek letter delta,  or , is used to denote change in mathematical sciences.emp

Negative 73110 pI have searched the far reaches of the internet for a couple days now, but cannot seem to find a solution to my issue. I have limited knowledge of programming, but if I can get this to work, it is going to do wonderful things. p  pEXPLANATION I need to make a copy of a template spreadsheet, using a script inside spreadsheet A and copy over all the permissions of the template into the copy specifically the name and protected ranges. I am using SheetSpider.p  pAs of right now, I can create the duplicate of the template, but SheetSpider seems to drop the permissions that the template has, and rewrites them with users that you define during the setup process. Instead, I would just like to copy the permissions of the template file. It seems to be tricky because a regular copy of the spreadsheet still does not bring over the permissions for the name and protected range settings like it would if you go to file  copy spreadsheet and check the box that says and share with the same users which DOES retain protected range settings. p  pAgain, I have a very limited knowledge of programming, but I think I have pinpointed the lines that seem to drop and reset the permissions. I have tried playing with the below for days now to get it to leave the permissions alone, but to no avail.p  pAny help or guidance would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp  precodefunction checkFixFileACLsfile, approvedViewers, approvedEditors    var viewers  file.getViewers.join,   viewers  viewers.split,   var editors  file.getEditors.join,   editors  editors.split,   viewers  arrdiffeditors, viewers   var owner  file.getOwner.toString   var fileKey  file.getId   var driveFile  DriveApp.getFileByIdfileKey   var currViewers  []   for var k0 kltviewers.length k      if viewers[k]ampampapprovedViewers.indexOfviewers[k].toLowerCase1ampampapprovedEditors.indexOfviewers[k].toLowerCase1ampampviewers[k]owner        try          callfunction driveFile.removeViewerviewers[k].toLowerCase        catcherr          Logger.logerr.message             else        currViewers.pushviewers[k].toLowerCase           for var k0 kltapprovedViewers.length k      if approvedViewers[k]ampampapprovedViewers[k]        if currViewers.indexOfapprovedViewers[k]1          try            callfunction driveFile.addViewerapprovedViewers[k].toLowerCase          catcherr            Logger.logerr.message                           var currEditors  []   for var k0 klteditors.length k      if editors[k]ampampapprovedEditors.indexOfeditors[k].toLowerCase1ampampeditors[k]owner        try          callfunction driveFile.removeEditoreditors[k].toLowerCase        catcherr          Logger.logerr.message             else        currEditors.pusheditors[k].toLowerCase.replacesg,            for var k0 kltapprovedEditors.length k      if approvedEditors[k]ampampapprovedEditors[k]        if currEditors.indexOfapprovedEditors[k].toLowerCase1          try            callfunction driveFile.addEditorapprovedEditors[k].toLowerCase.replacesg,           catcherr            Logger.logerr.message                           return  codepre

Also inside the dictionary was the starting memory address of each variable, and the type of value it was, such as int32 or signedint64, etc.p  pMy program was supposed to make a print out of each variable, and each component of any arrays, its memory address and its value. The problem was, how do I deal with arrays They could be one dimensional, two dimensional, twelve dimensional or even zero dimensional single value but I needed to get them all with one program. Another important factor was making the program robust enough to endure any number of dimensions.p

Negative 73110 pWe are having an issue where we are using sagas that defer messages for timely execution with a versioning variable. The sagas get a date for execution, defer the messages, and send a timeout to cancel the saga set for five days after the last deferred message. This allows people throughout the company to resolve any errors utilizing the saga data within the five days before the timeout. p  pWe also offer an option to requeue deferred messages in the case that business rules change. We have been utilizing this method with much success over the course of the last several months. Recently there was a business rule change, which deferred all messages for a particular client. While all of the saga data seems ok, and it appears that it is resetting the timeouts to expire at the later date. When the deferred messages execute, it is stating the saga no longer exists, when I look at this, I see this as well. Furthermore, I have noticed that the deferred messages do not carry a SagaID. I verified this is nothing new as a bunch of the still queued messages do not contain a SagaID neither, but they appear to be executing successfully.p  pMy question regards the ability to read the timeout and deferred message data. I notice they appear encrypted and what I see is an NServiceBus built message. I was curious if there was a way to read the message that is created by NServiceBus.p  precode   Destination      Queue clientdata,     Machine cnapp04   ,   SagaId 00000000000000000000000000000000,   State PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiAPg0KPE1lc3NhZ2VzIHhtbG5zOnhzaT0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMS9YTUxTY2hlbWEtaW5zdGFuY2UiIHhtbG5zOnhzZD0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMS9YTUxTY2hlbWEiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vdGVtcHVyaS5uZXQvTHNyLk1pbGl0YXJ5U2VhcmNoLlNlYXJjaC5NZXNzYWdlcyICjxRdWV1ZWRTZWFyY2hDb21tYW5kPgo8U2FnYUlEPmIxNmM4NDk5LTc,   Time 20130909T090000.0000000Z,   CorrelationId null,   OwningTimeoutManager ClientData,   Headers      WinIdName COMPANYusername,     NServiceBus.Timeout.Expire 20130909 090000000000 Z,     NServiceBus.OriginatingSagaId b16c849972f64cea89e1a18e0101eb82,     NServiceBus.OriginatingSagaType ClientData.Search.Handlers.SalesPolicy.SaleHandler, ClientData.Search, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull,     NServiceBus.EnclosedMessageTypes ClientData.Search.Messages.QueuedSearchCommand, ClientData.Search, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull,     NServiceBus.RelatedTo db644e605ba14d26a4ef876855581bd542719333,     NServiceBus.TimeSent 20130401 173442712194 Z,     NServiceBus.Version 3.2.7,     CorrId null     codepre  pFurther, how does one utilize the CorrelationID I am not seeing how this is set.p

Negative 73110 pHi Im having problems with updating results of a calculation using the change method.p  pThe calculation is made from dynamically created data that is placed into a table row. so the last column of each row should show the total of the price  qty qty is derived from dynamically created select element. The way to create each row is by selecting an option from the autocomplete input box.p  pEvery time the user select the option from the select element that is in a dt ,the total of that row should be updated. it works the first time but the second time the result column turn to NaN.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net49axJ3 relnofollowstrongemjSfiddleemstrongap  pI think i might have problems with how I set up the rows with thep  precode tr.notfirst.eachfunction meant to not get the header but the rest of the rows which have the data for the calculations  codepre  por the math part. i subtracted 0 from a string to make that into a number so I think I shouldnt get NaN.

After finding the process had been running for two days and killing it, I get emailed the STDERR from the script by cronjob, ending withp  precodeFatal error Maximum execution time of 3600 seconds exceeded in homemyusermysiteincbrowser.php on line 102 homemyusermysitebackgroundprocess.sh line 2 28189 Terminated usrlocalbinsetlock n x tmpnewdb.1.lock usrlocalbin codepre  pIm not worried about the fact that the PHP script reached its maximum execution time  that can happen. I want to know why if the PHP script had died from a fatal error, the process was still hanging around in ps, along with the sh command cron used to launch itp  precodemyuser 32091  0.0  0.0   8892  1104         Ss   Oct28   000 binsh c mysitebackgroundprocess.sh newminmaxdispatcher  myuser 32142 46.7  5.2 328788 131920        R    Oct28  6324 usrlocalbinphp homemyusermysitebackgroundnewminmaxdispatcher.php codepre  pAs I see it, the php command should have ended with the Fatal Error, causing the setlock to complete, the backgroundprocess.sh script to finish, and the whole cronjob to be done. I suspect that there might be something weird going on because of the piping of streams or some side effect of setlock. I dont know enough about either to even know where to look next.p

Negative 73110 pAlright,p  pI have a JFrame which uses a classloader to load an Applet onto a JPanel, which is added to my JFrame.p  pThe java Applet is a game in which I am trying to create a bot for.  I would like to be able to minimize my JFrame and allow the bot to continue to run.  This bot will only be clicking on x,y coordinates within the loaded Applet.p  pAfter doing research it seems I would want to fire Mouse events through the AWT event Dispatch onto my JFrame.  However this does not seem to work.  p  pI think it is either the case that I am firing events to the wrong component, or am misunderstanding how dispatching mouseEvents actually work.p  pI am pretty stumped, and am hoping for any suggestions on what to do.p  pThanks, Tonyp  precodeMouseEvent me  new MouseEventgetContentPane,  which                                         MouseEvent.MOUSECLICKED,                                          System.currentTimeMillis,                                          0,                                          50, 50,                                          1,                                          false                                  getContentPane.dispatchEventme codepre  pUPDATE My events are in fact getting dispatched, just not onto the applet that is loaded into the JFrame.  Why does the Applet not recognize the clicks perhaps it is clicking behind the appletp  pSOLVED What I needed to do was fire a MOUSEPRESSED and then MOUSERELEASED event.  Just firing MOUSECLICKED didnt actually do what I wanted.  I feel stupid that I spent so much time to figure that out. p

Negative 73110 ppython devs. I have a conceptual question. Im writing some screen scraping code that retrieves data from the same website, but with 5,000 hits to the server with a slightly different connection string each time. Ive written it as multithreaded, and its my first use of threading in python. p  pAs it is now, it creates 100 threads and runs, but the program never returns I did join the threads at the end of the module. When I run just 1,000 queries, it does run as expected and all is well it returns. Over 1,000, I see max retry errors in the console. So my question is... p  pHow do I pause every 1,000 runs at the server for one minute before continuing, in a multithreaded contextp  pIm not sure if I should use an incremented counter in the module, and if I do, do I need to synchronize access to it with a lock Is this something that can be done best utilizing the queue Ive been searching for relevant info on this application off and on all week, and the best conceptual approach eludes me. Any ideas Many thanks in advance...p

Negative 73110 pIn my Rails app I am doing two things  comparing an Active Record result to an array built from a JSON response from external API.p  pFirst step is checking which results are in the

finding it tricky to do the opposite of this  find numbers in the API array that are not in my database table.p  precodedef self.orphanedintelco   dbnumbers  self.findall.mapx x.number   allnumbers  self.alltelco   listednumbers  allnumbers.mapx x.number   orphanednumbers  listednumbers  dbnumbers   orphanedresults   how to filter allnumbers by orphanednumbers   return oprhanedresults end codepre

this difficult because its the same view and partial that was used before to display these orphaned numbers both iterations but its legacy code so Ive never seen it working in action but Im just confused how it worked before with Active Record results and a normal array.p  pThe view is justp  precodelt render partial gt listitem, collection gt telconumbers  gt codepre  pWhere codetelconumberscode is set to the return value of the above methods. codetelconumbers  TelcoNumber.orphanedintelco params[page]codep  pThe partial is as followsp  precodelttrgt lttdgt  lt linkto

codeEditcode action, it would have an codeAdd Newcode link since its not in my database table yet so I am just trying to figure out how to refactor the inefficient version so that it will still work with the shared view.p  pIf it helps, the format of the JSON API response is p  precode[countrycode44,number1133508889,blocknull,typeLegacy,SMS0, codepre  pSo only codecountrycodecode and codenumbercode correspond to columns in my database table, the rest isnt necessary, hence the codeifcode statements in the partial to only show certain parameters if they are available.p

Negative 73110 pI am using HttpClient from an ASP.NET app to invoke a WebAPI based REST service. Both the REST service and the ASP.NET app are secured using Windows authentication using Kerberos. I need to impersonate the user so that the call into the REST service is made using the users credentials and not the service account credentials.Since HttpClient creates a new Task for making async calls, it does not carry forward the security context of the user and instead uses the app pools identity.p  pThis has been well documented a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10308938unabletoauthenticatetoaspnetwebapiservicewithhttpclientherea and the suggestion to update the legacyImpersonationPolicy and the alwaysFlowImpersonationPolicy tags in the Aspnet.config file works but it is a machine wide change which I would like to avoid.p  pThis a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netowscottarchive20111201settinganaspnetconfigfileperapplicationpool.aspx relnofollowarticlea indicates that it is possible to set a per app pool aspnet.config file which is much more ideal but it doesnt seem to work.

Negative 73110 pThis is a rather complex issue so I created a a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditdjdcomByxfT2PJQiu6dxppreview relnofollowPlunkera to help illustrate. I have 2 angular modules in a single js file. One called base handles the typical application setup. The other called basePlusCors has some additional config stuff in it, but no new directives or services, and includes the base module as a dependency. Think of it as basePlusCors extends base. I am having two problems p  pFirst In app.js, if I dont comment out line 461  473, I get a circular dependency error on the basePlusCors test. Why is thatp  pSecond This is probably related to the first, but with the above lines commented out, the test still manages to execute the httpInterceptor from the base module. I thought I mocked the base module, why is it running that interceptor Is there a way to clear out all the angular modules and stuff before executing a block of tests so I can start testing the basePlusCors module with a clean slatep

Negative 73110 pI have a C, COMexposed .NET assembly, which I use heavily as a library for VB6 clients Office VBA.  I am extremely happy with it.p  pThat same COMexposed library is useful for me in some newer, .NET clients I have written as well.

But I now have several, independent copies of my COM assembly floating around with my .NET apps in addition to it being registered as a COM object on the machines in question.p  pThis means that every time I make a bug fix or add functionality to my COM, I need to update these floating copies as well which makes maintenance annoying at best. I want to expose my needed functionality emonceem, for all apps that use it isnt that the purpose of COMp  pI tried activating the COM using late binding, hoping I could get around the problem but I got different behavior on two different machines, so I decided to ditch that idea.p  pIs there an elegant way to handle this  I thought perhaps it would make sense to register the COM assembly in the GAC upon installation, but it just seems like the wrong thing to do since its already registered as COM plus, it seems like registering in the GAC is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma498367864414not considered good practicea.p

Negative 73110 pI am new in Hibernate. I am developing a backend service with Java and Hibernate.p  pI have a codeStudentcode entity, it has a manytomany relationship with codeGroupcode entity.

If there is such updatechange, I will inform client.p  pstrongWith hibernate, how can I implement this kind of listener to listen to the changeupdate in database tablestrongp
Negative 73110 pI have been thinking about building my own compiler for a while and a few days ago I finally started on it. My compiler works like thisp  ul liParse code from my own file. With a .exe file made with cli liCreate assembly code  li liCreate a file containing those assembly codeli liCompile that assembly file if it is made done with a vbs scriptli liLink the .obj fileli liAnd we have our .exe fileli ul  pNow I am having difficulties with finding the best way to parse my code. I havent really made this yet but I will put my ideas here.p  ul liFind all variables and declare them. variables will be preceded with a var  for now. uninitialized variables will be put in the .data section and initialized ones in the .data section.li liFind the main procedure and start executing the functions and operations.li ul  pNow I was simply wondering if someone can improve my ideas. Or if someone has a better idea to make some kind of compiler and your own programming language.p
Negative 73110 pIm trying to create a statistics report that gets automatically updated as data is put into a corresponding worksheet.  So this being said, theres no telling how much data will be put into the database, so I need to reference entire columns AH, instead of closed arrays A1H70.p  pI need the counts, for example, of women who have cancer and live in the city.p  pEven more, I have a lot of columns, and it happens that sex and whether or no they have cancer will be on totally different sides of the spreadsheet, meaning I have to have a huge array full of data I dont care about, and Im not sure how to control for that or if I even need to  maybe Im just confusing myself somehow.p  pTo further clarify what I am trying to do, I know that if I were programming this in SAS, I would use Proc Prints Where clause in one easy breezy beautiful line.p  pAny ideas as to what Excel function I need to use to do this  Ive run through a gambit of ideas, trying to use VLOOKUP, ARRAY, MATCH, and a nested IF tree, but all of them ran into dead ends along the way.  Thank you for any ideas you might havep

Really new to java and android I dont really know what Im doingmight not understand you.p

Negative 73110 pI have a problem that Im not able to solve by myself. I have to download data from my Web server before the user can see the ViewcodeUITableViewControllercode, so at the time that the codeUITableViewcode should be visible, it should have the content to show. The problem is, I start downloading the data in codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode, I have codeNSLogscode in codeviewDidLoadcode and in codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode, the funny thing is that the codeNSLogscode of the codeviewDidLoadcode are called before the codeNSLogscode of the codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode those codeNSLogscode are wrote just after all the data is downloaded.p  pOnce i finish downloading the data, i have an codeNSMutableArraycode that i pass from the codeAppDelegatecode to the codeTableViewControllercode, but the codetableViewControllercode appears totally empty because the codeViewDidLoadcode is called before all the data has been downloaded. p  pThen I have 1 question Where i should download all the data before the codeTableViewcode is loaded p  pstrongSolution that Ive been thinking aboutstrong I thought about creating another codeViewControllercodeIt would be the main View with an codeUIImageViewcode that have the image  Loading...  There I download all the data that I need and I store all the Data to an codeNSMutableArraycode. After the data is downloaded, I call the codeUITableViewControllercode and i pass the codeNSMutableArraycode to the codeUITableViewControllercode. I am sure this solution will work, but it has to be an easier way to solve this.p
Negative 73110 pI am working with array codeSomeObject[] someObject  new SomeObject[5000]code. p  pEach instance inside this array is unique to each other instance but, as a statistical expectation, they require the same computational overhead. In addition the standard deviation of the distribution of computational overhead for each codesomeObject[i]code is very narrow each codesomeObject[i]code should take code8code  code12code nanoseconds each, mostly clustering around code10code nanoseconds. p  pWhat I have noticed is that if I fill this array with the identical instance codesharedObject  new SomeObjectcode, and loop over codeSomeObject[]code, itll be really fast. For examplep  precode SomeObject sharedObject  new SomeObject  forint i  0 i lt 5000  i       someObjects[i]  sharedObject    forint i  0 i lt 5000  i       someObjects[i].doSomething runs really fast.   codepre  pBut if I fill the array asp  precode forint i  0 i lt 5000  i       someObjects[i]   new SomeObject    forint i  0 i lt 5000  i       someObjects[i].doSomething runs really slow.   codepre  pthen itll loop over codesomeObjectcode 8 times more slowly, even though each instance has the same computational overhead as each other within 1 or 2 nanoseconds when isolated.p  pWhy does this occur and how do I stop this explosion of computational cost occurringp  pAll computations within each instance of codeSomeObjectcode are only over the internal state of that object.p  pNote that the space on the heap is truly minimal for each codenew SomeObjectcode, so it is not forcing garbage collection.p  pHeres some code that recreates the problem but nowhere near as severe as my real life examplep  precodepublic class Test2       public final double random     public final Double[] sub      public Test2double random          this.random  random          sub  new Double[1000]         forint i  0  i lt 1000  i              sub[i]  Math.random                    public void doSomething          forint i  0  i lt 1000  i              double j  i  100056444sub[i]                      public static void mainString[] args          Test2 testFirst  new Test2Math.random         Test2[] testFirstArray  new Test2[10000]         Test2[] testSecondArray  new Test2[10000]          forint i  0  i lt 10000  i              testFirstArray[i]  testFirst             testSecondArray[i]  new Test2Math.random                   Warmup         forint i  0  i lt 10000  i              testFirstArray[i].doSomething             testSecondArray[i].doSomething                   Time first class         double firstTimer  System.nanoTime         forint i  0  i lt 10000  i              testFirstArray[i].doSomething                  System.out.printlnSystem.nanoTime  firstTimer10001000           Time second class         double secondTimer  System.nanoTime         forint i  0  i lt 10000  i              testSecondArray[i].doSomething                  System.out.printlnSystem.nanoTime  secondTimer10001000         codepre

A snapshot of the information I am using isp  precodeField1  dB1.LeftSerious Field2  dB1.LeftDangerous Field3  Tester Formula  LeftTot codepre  pFields 12 are the total score given by the Tester for each Left Test.p  precodeTest   Field1   Field2   Field3 1      2.0      4.0      J Adams 2      1.0      1.0      J Adams 3      1.0      0.0      S Grey 4      0.0      1.0      S Grey 5      5.0      0.0      D Jones 6      5.0      8.0      D Jones codepre  pThe formula to get the Grand Total for each Testers Left Test uses a grouping by Testerp  precodeLeftTot   Sum dB1.LeftSerious, Tester  Sum dB1.LeftDangerous, Tester codepre  pUsing the above details we getp  precodeJ Adams  8.0  S Grey  2.0  D Jones  18.0  codepre  pThe Maximum figure is therefore 18.0 and the minimum figure is 2.0 and the required difference is 16.0.p  pThe problem I have is I cannot use the Maximum or Minimum commands as Crystal 2008 will not let you use the Summary Functions like Maximum on a formula that sums two fields.  I know you could create a new aggregate field in the database which would solve the problem however I currently do not have administrator access to the databases and cannot create any new data tables or fields.p  pI have tried to get the ball rolling by using the following code in 3 new formulasp  precodeLeftTotGrpHdr This Formula needs to be placed into the Group Header to reset variable WhilePrintingRecords NumberVar LEFTTL0  LeftTotGrpFtr This Formula needs to be placed into the Group Footer to display variable WhilePrintingRecords NumberVar LEFTTL  LeftTotCr This Formula declares and works out Total Left Tests  WhilePrintingRecords Global NumberVar LEFTTLLEFTTL  LeftTot codepre  pHowever when I try to usep  precodeMaximumLeftTotCr codepre  pin a new formula I still get the error message This field cannot be summarised.p  pIs there another way to do thisp  pCheers  p  pDaveytp

Negative 73110 pI have been having no end of difficulties in trying to set up Foundation 5 so that I can customise it using SASS.  According to Zurb Foundation using SASS is the easiest way to customise it but for some reason there isnt any useful documentation on this.p  pI have searched everywhere and found bits and peices of inforamtion and have finally managed to get something working so that when I amend the main SCSS file it creates a corresponding CSS file.  However, whatever variables I add to my SCSS file to try and amend the colours etc, it seems to have no effect.  I read somewhere to copy the variables you want to change from the settings.scss file and enter them into your own scss file and then amend the values.

Negative 73110 pI have some data I want to analyze in Matlab R2013b. The data set however consists of 10 tab delimited text files in total 16GB, each file contains the same fields. My idea was to insert all data into a single table using MSSQL. However, since I only need to do select queries, I was wondering if there is another method where I can use Azure Table Storage or some other NoSql alternative in Matlab. I expect my queries to be a little slow with a 16GB table Core i7 860, 12GB RAM,HDD,Win8.1. Please let me know what I could use and what options I have concerning the import of large raw data sets for statistical analysis in terms of better performance and ease of use.p  pI understand multiple solutions could be useful, please provide some advice on what you would use and why. Of course also some tutorials for Matlab are also much appreciated which I could not find yet while Googling myself  .p

So basically, Ill have  16 IIS instances, speaking with 16 Weblogic instances, with a 11 relationship.p  pPersonaly, Im very skeptical about this architecture, becausep  ul lipwhat could happen if a Weblogic instance goes down  I mean, the IIS instance still continues to receive requests from the load balancing system. I know that the new load balancing system can first send a request to see if the application is responding, and if so, it will let the request go further. But, I can imagine that this is taking quite a lot of time, and its not good for performance.pli lipMoreover, if the application is responding meaning Weblogic is UP and running, but this time, IIS is not, the load balancing system will send the request to an IIS instance that is down. So users will have to wait foreverpli ul  pDo you see other benefits or big drawbacks of this new solution that I may have missed  Is it a good architecture solution p  pI need a lot of answers to see clearly if this is good or not.p  pThank you guys.

I have tried running this method after i start both services, however I keep getting a null pointer exception.

I need all those cases to come up with the same application. Moreover, all java applications like EditPad point to the JVM.p  pIs there something I can do with PID, like get both the application and company names, as shown in Procecss Explorer, under the Description and Company Name columns That would be perfect.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjzSHk.png altenter image description herep

Negative 73110 pI have a program where the user does some actions i.e. clicking on several buttons. I want to record their clicks and the buttons that they click to allow the user to then download a text file with a record of their clicks when they click a separate download button. I looked at the Filesystem APIs for HTML 5, but they seemed to not have crossbrowser support. I would ideally like to have this entire file generation and download scheme be entirely clientside, but I am open to serverside ideas as well.p  pTLDR Essentially Im looking for an equivalent to Javas FileWriter, FileReader, ObjectOutputStream, and ObjectInputStream within Vanilla JS or jQuery would like to stay away from php, but Ill use it as a last option. p  pAlso, why dont all browsers support the filesystem api Im guessing that it would make MSWord and Pages go out of business with all the open source clientside text editors that could come out.p

I got that part pretty well covered with my code.p  pThis is my javascript file for parsing the files p  precodevar fs  requirefs var xmldom  requirexmldom var async  requireasync   Parse catalog xml file and call callbackcatalog domxml root function parsecatalogcatalog, callback       Read xml file content     fs.readFilecatalog, function err, data          if err              throw Error reading XML catalog          else               Parse xml content and return dom root             var domRoot  new xmldom.DOMParser.parseFromStringdata.toString              Call callback passing dom root             callbackdomRoot        codepre  pI got two methods like this to convert the xml to json and its working perfectly one for teachers and one for studentsp  precode Convert teacher XML into json format in a array function convertteachersdomCatalog      var teachers  domCatalog.getElementsByTagNameteacher     var teachersarr []     for var i  0 i lt teachers .length i          var teacher teachers[i]         ...         Reading the xml           teachersarr.push         ...         Create the json                    console.logTeachers are now in JSON format   codepre  pSo in the end all I have to do is this p  precodeparsecatalogteachers.xml, convertteachers codepre  pWhen I do this p  precodeparsecatalogteachers.xml, convertteachers parsecatalogstudents.xml, convertstudents codepre  pOne or the other will finish first depending on the number of elements to import, witch is normal I think.p  pWhat I want is to wait for both to be imported and then do some javascript manipulations and this is where I am stuck.p  pI tried to do this with async, but it doesnt not wait until the two files are finished to import.p  precodeasync.parallel[     functioncallback          parsecatalogteachers.xml, convertteachers         callback     ,      functioncallback          parsecatalogstudents.xml, convertstudents         callback      ], functionerr       if err return nexterr      console.logFinished     Enventually some Javascript manipulations on the two arrays   codepre  pActually it outputs p  precodeFinished Teachers are now in JSON format Students are now in JSON format codepre  por depending of the file sizep  precodeFinished Students are now in JSON format Teachers are now in JSON format codepre  pWhat I would like is more like p  precodeTeachers are now in JSON format or students Students are now in JSON format or teachers Finished codepre  pI plan to load 2 more files, and the order they will be loaded doesnt matter to me.p  pAny leads  Thanksp

Negative 73110 pI am working on a project for my job and I need it to create a string of data only when the com port is high and ends the string when it goes low, it will then analyze the string and look for key words to make a decision.p  pSo here is the setup.p  pAt work we have a fully automated RAM tester that is connected to a computer via serial line to communicate with the software that came with the RAM tester. When the test begins the RAM is inserted into the RAM tester, the tests starts, and data begins to come over the serial line. data such as the current test that is being run, the RAM modules speed, chip configuration, and a timer that counts up until the test is complete pass or fail comes over the serial line. when the test is completed the module is removed, then it is dropped down to a conveyor belt that sorts passed modules from failed modules and the next module is inserted into the tester and the process repeats. In between the time where the test is completed and the module is removed, and the next module is inserted, there is a window of time about 3 seconds where the serial line has no data coming over it. This 3 second window is what I am hoping to use to end the capture of my string of serial data, and let python run its assessments to make its decision. once the string is assessed and the decision is made, the program will discard the string and begin reading from the serial port, capturing the data into another string until the 3 second of downtime on the serial line occurs again, ending the capture of data into a string.It will have to loop around and preform this task infinitely. I have every part of this project set to go besides capturing the string of serial datawhich is a HUGE part of my project. I just need help on learning how to use the downtime on the serial to end the string. The reason the string has to end according to the 3 second downtime on the serial line is because the data that comes over the serial line for each module varies with the length of the test, ruling out setting a preset number of bytes to read and place into the string. The amount of data varies per module because of the timer. I will include a sample of the serial data on the bottom of my question description, and you can see what Im talking about when I mention the timer. the higher the capacity of the module, the longer the test takes, and the higher the timer counts which makes the serial data per module higher. Also if the module fails the test ends immediately, so the timer data that comes over the serial line can also be very short. I hope this makes sense since I do not feel that I am the best at explaining things.p  pThank you very much for your help in advancep  pHere is the sample of the data coming over the serial line I mentioned earlier.p  blockquote   p... ..Waiting for Handler Start ........[ Esc. ]e.E.E..em..L001 wkaddr                    [0000]....[Cancel]A.em..L001 wkdata                    [0000]....[Cancel]A.em..L001 Mats                       [0001]....[Cancel]A...[0002]...[0002]...[0003]...[0003]...[0003]...[0004]...[0005]...[0005]...[0006]...[0006]...[0007]...[0007]...[0008]...[0009]...[0009]...[0010].em..L001 MarX                      [0010]....[Cancel]A...[0011]...[0011]...[0012]...[0012]...[0012]...[0013]...[0014]...[0014]...[0015]...[0015]...[0016]...[0016]...[0017]...[0018]...[0018]...[0019]...[0019]...[0020]...[0020]...[0021].em..L001 MarC                      [0021]....[Cancel]A...[0022]...[0022]...[0023]...[0023]...[0024]...[0024]...[0025]...[0025]...[0026]...[0026]...[0027]...[0028]...[0028]...[0029]...[0029]...[0030]...[0031]...[0031]...[0032]...[0032]...[0032]...[0033]...[0034]...[0034]...[0035]...[0035]...[0036]...[0037]...[0037]...[0037]...[0038]...[0039].em..L001 MarY                      [0039]....[Cancel]A...[0039]...[0040]...[0040]...[0041]...[0041]...[0042]...[0042]...[0043]...[0043]...[0044]...[0044]...[0045]...[0045]...[0046]...[0046]...[0047]...[0047]...[0048]...[0048]...[0049]...[0049]...[0050]...[0050]...[0051]...[0051]...[0052]...[0052]...[0053]e....E.aD.0.Module..

Negative 73110 pIt is possible to upload multiple files in onedriveskydrive using WL.upload  I tried something but I always get an error like element must be an html input element or something like this.

Because my input is set on multiple I tried to iterate through the files that contains and to create an input element to pass to the method, but its doesnt work because due to security reasons I can set a value of an input element.p  pSo, does anybody knows how I can do this  Thanksp  pThis is what I have triedp  precode ltdiv idsavetoskydrivedialogcontentmultiplegt         ltpgtselect a fileltpgt         ltform enctypemultipartformdata methodPOSTgt             ltinput idsavetoskydrivefileinputmultiple typefile namefiles[] multiple gt         ltformgt         ltpgtupload fileltpgt         ltbutton idsavetoskydriveuploadmultiplebuttongtupload multipleltbuttongt  ltdivgt  function saveMultipleToSkyDrive          WL.fileDialog             mode save         .thenfunction response              var folder  response.data.folders[0]              var elements  document.getElementByIdsavetoskydrivefileinputmultiple.files              for var i  0 i lt elements.length i                   var htmlInPutElement  document.createElementinput                 htmlInPutElement.setAttributetype, file                 htmlInPutElement.value  elements.itemi                  WL.api                                    WL.upload                     path folder.id,                     element htmlInPutElement,                     overwrite rename                 .thenfunction response                      logYou save to  response.source  .

Negative 73110 pPreviously, I was using storm topology to build my pipeline to suffice my use case which was  Reading from Kafka topic through Kafka spout, process these tuples in Bolt, then emit them to ElasticSearch bolt to index my tuples. In storm topology, I was able to acknowledge each tuple i was indexing and these  acknowledgments were sent from EsBolt to spout and finally to Zookeeper.p  pLater I realised that Storm is not the appropriate component for my use case and I switched to Spark. I am doing the same thing with Spark  Reading from Kafka topic, reading messages in Spark stream, pass this stream to a component which converts this stream to RDD and finally indexes these RDDs.

Negative 73110 pFirst of all, some definitionsp  pPUT is defined in a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc2616rfc2616sec9.htmlsec9.6 relnofollowSection 9.6 RFC 2612ap  blockquote   pThe PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied RequestURI. If the RequestURI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity strongSHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin serverstrong. If the RequestURI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.p blockquote  pPATCH is defined in a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc5789 relnofollowRFC 5789ap  blockquote   pThe PATCH method requests that stronga set of changesstrong described in the      request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request      URI.p blockquote  pAlso according to a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc2616rfc2616sec9.htmlsec9.1.2 relnofollowRFC 2612 Section 9.1.2a PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.p  pNow lets take a look at a real example. When I do POST to codeuserscode with the data codeusername skwee357, email skwee357domain.comcode and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location lets assume codeusers1code and any next call to GET codeusers1code will return codeid 1, username skwee357, email skwee357domain.comcode.p  pNow lets say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered a set of changes and therefor I should PATCH codeusers1code with a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc5789section2 relnofollowpatch documenta. In my case it would be a json codeemail skwee357newdomain.comcode. The server then returns 200 assuming permission are ok. This brings me to first questionp  ul liPATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2612 and RFC 5789. However if Ill issue the same PATCH request with my new email Ill get the same resource state with my email being modified to the requested value. Why isnt PATCH then idempotentli ul  pPATCH is a relatively new verb RFC introduced in March 2010, and it comes to solve the problem of patching or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resource. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused what is PUT used for then And this brings me to second and the main questionp  ul liWhats the real difference between PUT and PATCH Ive read somewhere the PUT might be used to strongreplacestrong entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity instead of set of attributes as with PATCH. What is the real practical usage for such case When would you like to replace  overwrite an entity under specific resource URI and why such operation is not considered as updating  patching the entity The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on collection, i.e. codeuserscode to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrongli ul

If I look at the return of the .pipetar.Parse statement it is a stream, but it is not a stream.Readable or a stream.Writable. fstream does not define a read method its reader is based on Stream, it is not a stream.Readable, so tar.Parse, which is based on Stream, does not have one either.p  pSo a refinement of the question is, is this a bug in fstream, or is fstream not intended to be a stream I think it is a bug  from the READMEp  pLike FS streams, but with stat on them, and supporting directories and symbolic links, as well as normal files.

Negative 73110 pWe host our own Nuget server in addition to the public server. We publish our own libraries and share them accordingly. We have updated this package recently and my local build always adds an older version of a specific library within the package into the file system. p  pI noticed this when looking at my changes before commiting and have to ignore it or go and delete the dir to make it go away.p  pThis appears to only be happening locally on my build. I have tried multiple searches for the location of said library and version anywhere in the sandbox and the only place it pops up is in some hidden .suo file, but with no real helpful info as to where this reference exists.p  pI have toggled the load nuget packages on build and get no build errors when the package isnt loaded back into the mix either, so that one is ruled out.p  pany leads on how to stomp this little nuget ghostp

Negative 73110 pI am developing a iOS SDK and for the .a integration, the client has to include certain frameworks to get the code to run. Specifically for beacon support they have to include the CoreLocation framework. The goal is to allow them to use our SDK even if they dont have CoreLoation included. For cocoapods this is easy to handle, but I cant figure out how to handle it for static libraries.p  pI have tried hasinclude and checking if a class in framework exists, but I cant get it to run without either 1 Hiding the class whether or not CoreLocation is included or 2 Throwing exceptions complaining about CoreLocation not being therep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15642067checkforframeworksexistenceatcompiletimeOnly SO question related, but solutions havent helpedap

Negative 73110 pI wanted to make a clickable prototype of an app on storyboard only. I have just added two interface controllers and some images and buttons. I filled xcassets with several images overall less than 150kB and tried to run the app. When there was a single interface controller with 3 buttons images in background  1 imageView around 100kB all it took some time but the app lauched. I added 1 more interface controller and a few images to it the biggest are around 9kB and this time Xcode displayed me a message that it lost a connection with an iPhone but the watch is still running or the watch app timed out error. At the same time I have the app name on the watch screen and a spinner. And its spinning for ages without any result... Ive tried to delete the app from both devices, restarting, cleaning folders etc. and no success. Is there a limit of images one can put in the watchs xcassets So frustrating...p

Negative 73110 pMy application uses iframes to display content. I need to detect whether a page is loaded in an iframe. The problem is I need to do it with php, javascript manipulation of the DOM is not enough, I need to do something with php before page is loaded. I inject get parameters like inframe1 on every anchor click inside the iframe, it works. But I cant find a good workaround for post requests. I tried with hidden input fields, but it doesnt work in my case, I dont have any control over it, since this application is a plugin for another. p  pThe only workaround I have for post requests, is to check on iframe load, whether new location parameter contains inframe, if it doesnt then I add inframe to the location and load the link again. It works, but page loads twice after form submits. I could hide the iframe on submit and show it after page is loaded second time, so it looks like it loaded once, but still loading it 2 times is noticeably slower and unacceptable as a solution.p  pSo this is my not so good solutionp  pthis.iframeReload  functioniframe  event listener for iframe load p  precodevar newSrciframe.get0.contentWindow.location.href  if newSrc.indexOfinframe1      console.logredirecting     ifnewSrc.indexOf1 hrefinframe1     else newSrcampinframe1     iframe.get0.contentWindow.locationnewSrc     return 0 terminate function and reload the iframe with parameter  iframe.readyfunction  stuff to do after iframe loads  codepre  pp  pIs there a better way to do it Like intercept the contentWindow.location change and add the parameter to it before even the page loads.

I spent almost 4 hours on things related to this problem.p  pNow after Ive written it, mutation observer has come to my mind. I dont know much about it. Can it track contentWindow.location changes Im gonna try it.p

Negative 73110 pI asked another question similar to this one but I will try rewording it in order to make it clear exactly what it is I am trying to do. I currently have a JSON file that breaks down like so There is a top level object, from that object there is an array of objects, each containing strings and ints. I want to get certain string values from these objects into an array that I can use to display in a UITableView and the only methods I see posted everywhere use this .append function, which is great when you are only checking the array to append one time maybe a few times a week but I would like the array to display the most current version every time the func is called.p  pSo far I have tried many different methods in order to cast the Name string that is contained within each of the objects into an array by .appending an array in swift that I called NameList. Doing it this way causes the program to stall while it appends each of the names into the array. My last question got the recommendation of doing a plist instead but I think because I wasnt clear on exactly what problem I have been having was. So to sum it up again I just want to cast all the string values into an array that can be called by the tableview. Is there anyway to do this without appending the array each time and just have the strings from the json to go directly to the tableview My current code isp  precodefunc updateArr              let path  NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResourceCardList, ofType json     let jsonData  NSDatacontentsOfFile path, options NSDataReadingOptions.DataReadingMappedIfSafe, error nil     let json  JSONdata jsonData     for key, subJson in json[array]          if let Name  subJson[Name].string              if let Class  subJson[Class].number                  if Class  Int1              cardNameList.appendName             printlncardNameList                                              codepre

Negative 73110 pthink I have a 2 text fields. Can I change there error messages according to text fields.p  pHere is a example.p  p1st text box is a email field and it is required field. So I keep it a error messages in a array p  precode[this field is required, enter a valid e mail] codepre  p2 text box is required field. Its error message p  precode[enter a valid value in the field]  codepre  pbut in kendo ui validator like this ...p  precode  var validator  formID.kendoValidator          messages                        required  this field is required,                      email  enter a valid email address                .datakendoValidator  codepre  pHow I change these values dynamically according to the text fields error messages p
Negative 73110 pIm learning recursive CTEs in the AdventureWorks2012 database using SQL Server 2014 Express.  I think Im mostly getting the below example taking from Beginning TSQL 3rd Edition, but I dont quite understand why the recursive CTE doesnt produce duplicates.  p  pBelow is the recursive CTE that Im trying to understand, its a standard employee  manager hierarchy.  p  precodewith orgchart employeeid, managerid, title, level, node as      Anchor     select employeeid     , managerid     , title     , 0     , convertvarchar30, node     from employee     where managerid is null      union all     Recursive     select emp.employeeid     , emp.managerid     , emp.title     , oc.level  1     , convertvarchar30, oc.node  convertvarchar30,emp.managerid       from employee emp     inner join orgchart oc on oc.employeeid  emp.managerid       select employeeid , managerid , spacelevel  3  title title , level , node from orgchart order by node codepre  pIt works fine, but the question comes when I try to understand whats going on by recreating it via temp tables.  I create a series of temp tables to plug one output into the next querys input and recreate what the recursive CTE does.  p  precodeAnchor Level 0 select employeeid , managerid , title , 0 , convertvarchar30, node into orgchart from employee where managerid is null codepre  pThen I use that temp table to recreate the first level of recursion, at this point its just the recursive CTE but with temp tables.  p  precodeAnchor  1 level select  into orgchart2 from orgchart union all select emp.employeeid , emp.managerid , emp.title , oc.level  1 , convertvarchar30, oc.node  convertvarchar30,emp.managerid    from employee emp inner join orgchart oc on oc.employeeid  emp.managerid codepre  pSo far so good, the results make sense.  Then I do it one more time, but heres where it starts to break downp  precodeAnchor  2 levels select  into orgchart3 from orgchart2 union all select emp.employeeid , emp.managerid , emp.title , oc.level  1 , convertvarchar30, oc.node  convertvarchar30,emp.managerid   from employee emp inner join orgchart2 oc on oc.employeeid  emp.managerid codepre  pThe output from this begins to return duplicate rows all fields duplicate of the level 1 employees.  This makes sense  the second query after the UNION ALL will return the previous levels as well as the new level of recursion, and UNION ALL doesnt duplicate.  If I do another round of recursion, the level 2 employees are also duplicated, and so on.p  pI understand that I can change UNION ALL to UNION in order to remove duplicates, but Im trying to understand why the recursive CTE doesnt produce duplicates as well  It uses UNION ALL so I dont understand where the deduplication comes in.  Is removal of duplicates an intrinsic part of a recursive CTE  p  pIm trying to post all the result sets, but if theyre needed to understand the problem then let me know and I will post them.  Thanks in advance.  p

Negative 73110 pI am using recently d3.js and I came up with an problem, for which I cant find an solution.p  pI need an stacked Barcolumn where I can configure how long an Category a part of one line is and which color it has. This length is computed from an formula. This formula is the same for the whole Line and chart.p  pI would like to knew how to assign an custom length to that categories and colors.  At the beginning I only have a Matrix, whose data is used by the formula. I suppose I have to do something with the data. Attribute. Btw, the formula takes also the graph height, and width into account so it is possible that the data has to be recomputed at runtime.p  pI can show no code, since I have no idea where to begin.p  pEDITp  pa hrefhttpchimera.labs.oreilly.combooks1230000000345ch11.htmlstacklayout relnofollowHerea its written that you have to use .stack to use stacked bars. And [here][2] is .stack used, but a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock3886208 relnofollowherea its not. I dont get why those in link3 dont need the stack function Furthermore its written that I have to provide data in p  precode      var dataset  [     [  x 0, y 5 ,        x 1, y 4 ,           ],     [       x 0, y 10 ,...] codepre  pform, my data is like that matrix  [[val1,val2,.....,val10], [val1,...val10]]p  pThe data in one inner Array should be stacked, that Martix has around 5k entries. Do I have to make an Matrix with 10 inner Array where each Array consists of 5k entries  And at last, that values are from 0 to 1, is it better to control the height of the bars with style or with scalep

Negative 73110 pIm using tdm gcc compilers to compile my winapi projects, when i test some simple mandelbrot sse code 9maybe with other projests its like the same but i not tested everything, 5.1 generates larger executable 330kB against 270kB though i not recompiled everything, only hot loop module and linked with already compiled in 4.7 ones and also noticalby slower code 23.5 ms frame agianst 20 ms in 4.7 p  pIt is scary.. What can i do with it the rest of settings etc is the same i only rename the compiler folder from one to anither p  pIm using clike code but compile in c modep  pDoes maybe someone know how to resolve it by resolve i mean make 5.1 build working at least as fast as 4.7, also would prefer the executable be smallerp  peditp  pps i made yet quick test p  pas i may compile loop module in 51 and link all in 47 p  pcompile loop 47 link 47 size 270k speed 20 ms p  pcompile loop 51 link 51 size 330k speed 23.5 ms p  pcompile loop 47 link 51 size 330k speed 20 ms p  pcompile loop 51 link 47 size 270k speed 23.5 ms p  pit shows that speed drop comes by compile in 51  and size bloat comes from link 51 p

Negative 73110 pI have a master data with both the material and product details in a single table.

Negative 73110 pIm trying the builtin Authentication of ServiceStack. My approach is codeOrmLiteAuthRepositorycode so users information are stored in Sql Server. I use Postman to test the endpoints.

But it created a new row in the database instead of updating the existing one. How does it workp  pWith GET, I got no implementation error.

Negative 73110 pI have a matrix of approximately 240 mio rows and 3 columns that I need to import and work with in R. I do not have access to a server right now, so I got the idea of importing a submatrix, working with it, and then discarding it from the environment and repeating the procedure until the whole matrix is done for what I have to do it works just as well. In particular, as the number of rows is multiple of 11, I decided to work with 11 submatrices. Therefore, what I have been doing is the followingp  ol liDefine Nstep as the number of rows to import every time total nr of rows11, it is about 22 Mio.li limat.n lt read.csv2filepath, nrowsNstep, skip n1Nstep1, headerTli lido what I have to doli lidiscard the matrixli lirepeat manually, to make sure every step is successful the above for n  1, 2, ..., 11.li ol  pAfter finishing importing the 6th block, I realized I was leaving headerT so I set headerF. Since then, every time I tried importing the file the R session aborted. EDIT setting back headerT is not working either.p  pI thought it depended on the headerF thing, but it was not the case. Therefore I guess it has to do with Nstep, or with the first row of the submatrix. I tried doing some experiments  if I reimport the first block, it works  if I import the 5th block, first ten rows only, it takes ages I let it start about 20 mins ago and is not finished yet, even though its just 10 rows  if I repeat it on R instead as on R Studio, I have the same issues.p  pAny idea about why this is happening I am working with R version 3.1.1 on R Studio Version 0.98.1028, Platform x8664w64mingw32x64 64bit.p

Negative 73110 pI have a JBoss application which has Oracle DB based password authentication using org.jboss.security.auth.spi.DatabaseServerLoginModule. This application is running on the older community edition jboss6.1.0.Final. I would like to throttle failed login attempts.  I figure that these may come in a couple of waysp  ol liA username which exists in the database has repeated failed password attemptsli liAttempts are made with usernames likely machine generated that do not exist in the database li ol  pI am currently only concerned with 2. p  pThis server is behind a reverse proxy, which would make tracking the IPs attempts come from difficult.p  pAfter a few fruitless hours of Googling I am none the wiser about how to implement logic whereby, in the case of 2, the failed attempts may be logged and some sort of lockout takes place. Another thought I had was that maybe a lockout isnt necessary, and instead implement some sort of CAPTCHA system. Again, I find no good resources on how to implement this within my current authentication scheme.p  pWhat are the suggested practices to deal with thisp
