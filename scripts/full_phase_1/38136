However, when I went back to our production version, which I hadnt touched, it was broken. Both databases sit on a single MySQL install.

Negative 38136 pThis is similar to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions236414previous questiona, but the answers there dont satisfy my needs and my question is slightly differentp  pI currently use gzip compression for some very large files which contain sorted data.  When the files are not compressed, binary search is a handy and efficient way to support seeking to a location in the sorted data.p  pBut when the files are compressed, things get tricky.  I recently found out about a hrefhttpwww.zlib.netzlibas codeZFULLFLUSHcode option, which can be used during compression to insert sync points in the compressed output codeinflateSynccode can then begin reading from various points in the file.  This is OK, though files I already have would have to be recompressed to add this feature and strangely codegzipcode doesnt have an option for this, but Im willing to write my own compression program if I must.p  pIt seems from a hrefhttpnewsgroups.derkeiler.comArchiveCompcomp.compression200602msg00327.htmlone sourcea that even codeZFULLFLUSHcode is not a perfect solution...not only is it not supported by all gzip archives, but the very idea of detecting sync points in archives may produce false positives either by coincidence with the magic number for sync points, or due to the fact that codeZSYNCFLUSHcode also produces sync points but they are not usable for random access.p  pIs there a better solution  Id like to avoid having auxiliary files for indexing if possible, and explicit, default support for quasirandom access would be helpful even if its largegrainedlike being able to start reading at each 10 MB interval.  Is there another compression format with better support for random reads than gzipp  pstrongEditstrong As I mentioned, I wish to do binary search in the compressed data.  I dont need to seek to a specific uncompressed positiononly to seek with some coarse granularity within the compressed file. I just want support for something like Decompress the data starting roughly 50 25, 12.5, etc. of the way into this compressed file.p
Negative 38136 pIm trying to implement a WPF application using MVVM ModelViewViewModel pattern and Id like to have the View part in a separate assembly an EXE from the Model and ViewModel parts a DLL.p  pThe twist here is to keep the ModelViewModel assembly clear of any WPF dependency. The reason for this is Id like to reuse it from executables with different nonWPF UI techs, for example WinForms or GTK under Mono.p  pBy default, this cant be done, because ViewModel exposes one or more ICommands. But the ICommand type is defined in the System.Windows.Input namespace, which belongs to the WPFp  pSo, is there a way to satisfy the WPF binding mechanism without using ICommandp  pThanksp
Negative 38136 pIm animating a UIViews frame property using a CAKeyframeAnimation on the views CALayer and animating the position property. Id like to be able to halt the animation at its current state when the user taps the screen, but Im unable to do so.p  pI can halt the animation easily enough by callingp  precode[view.layer removeAnimationForKeykFrameAnimationKey] codepre  pThe problem is that neither the views frame not its layers position are updated directly by the animation. If I look at the position property at the time the animation starts and when it ends inp  precode voidanimationDidStopCAAnimation animation finishedBOOLfinished codepre  pit has not changed.p  pIt seems that you need to do that explicitly when the animation stops. But if the animation stops at some arbitrary point, you dont know how far its gone. So the question is either how to make the animation update the layers position property as it goes, or how to know how far the animation has gone when its been stopped.p

Negative 38136 pI have a voidsave method that is called when a user clicks a navigation bar button.  In that method is the following NSTimerp  precode[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval.25f targetself selectorselectorflashBackgroundRed userInfo nil repeats flashRepeat] codepre  pThe timer repeats 4 times since the flashBackgroundRed keeps a count and sets flashRepeat to NO after 4 hits.  All works well the first time a user clicks to save.  But if the user keeps hitting save with incorrect data, I keep them on the current view. For some reason, flashes get increasing faster.  As if each one is 25 of the previous ones interval.  Im not retaining this timer.  It only lives in the save method.   p  pIf the user clicks the cancel button, viewB one with NSTimer is popped and viewA displays.  Going from viewA back to viewB seems to reset the timer invterval.  But the increasingly fast flashes cycle starts again.  Any ideasp
Negative 38136 pI have a control which hosts a codeNumericUpDowncode in a codeToolStripControlHostcode and exposes the codeNumericUpDowncodes properties.

Negative 38136 pI have been struggling with choosing a methodology for creating a RESTful API with Django. None of the approaches Ive tried seem to be the silver bullet. WAPI from a hrefhttpfi.amhttpfi.ama is probably the closest to what I would like to accomplish, however I am not sure if it is acceptable in a true RESTful API to have parameters that are resource identifiers be in the querystring instead of in a clean URL format. Any suggestions for modifying WAPIs RestBinding.PATTERN to clean up the URLs Another option Ive explored is DjangoRestInterface. However this framework seems to violate one of the most important pieces I need, and that is to include the full resource URL for references to other resources see a hrefhttpjacobian.orgwritingrestworstpracticeshttpjacobian.orgwritingrestworstpracticesa Improper Use of Links. The final option is to use djangomultiresponse and basically do it the long way.p  pPlease offer me your best advice, especially people that have dealt with this decision.  p

Negative 38136 pI am using the JQuery plugin jVal.   This plugin validates user input.   If the user makes an error the input box is turned red and a fly out message says what is wrong.   This works great for forms where there is one Label and one input per visual row.    This falls apart when you have multiple labels and inputs per row.   IE the fly out error gets confused with the underlying information.   Is there a way to have just a  next to the field having the error, then display a summary of the all field errors in a different DIV.  I am open to other JQuery plugins that would give me validation and the presentation I am after.p

Negative 38136 pI cannot seem to get my head around how to do a proper layout in Ext GWT that responds properly to resizes.p  pI assume that I can declaratively specify layouts, put my components in them, and let the library take care of the rest I just havent figured out how yet. What I really dont want to be doing is writing resize handlers for my components to calculate and set the size of the subcomponents at every resize event.p  pMy application should fill the entire browser window, and consists of a number of tabs. Every tab page should fill the emremainingem space available after the tab bar. Actually, this is the problem I keep having. I have some fixed size controls at the top or left of the screencomponent a toolbar, a folder bar, etc., and the remaining controls should take up the remainder of the available space.p  pI have already figured out that I should be using a Viewport as my toplevel component, and probably FitLayout should factor in there somewhere. But what kind of resizeaware layout do I use to allocate a bit of space to my fixedsize controls preferably their natural size so I dont have to specify that as well and have the other controls take up the remainderp  pAnd is it correct that I am building my custom controls as a combination of existing controls as a subclass of LayoutContainer So far, Ive been using LayoutContainers with a FlowLayout and fixedsize subcontrols, and while that works in a sense, it cannot respond to parent container resizes, which seems essential to me.p  pI am trying to wrap my head around how the library wants me to do this, but documentation seems to be scarce. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 38136 pI currently have a game that takes in large images, easily bigger than 1MB, to serve as backgrounds. I know exactly when this transition is supposed to take place, so I made a loader class to handle loading these large images in the background, but when I load the images it still freezes the main thread where the drawing takes place. Since this code runs on the 360 I moved the thread to the 4th hardware thread, but that doesnt seem to help. Below is the class I am using.

It just adds complexity when creating a Policy as we must handle the id etc. Was it worth doing this pli lipI am thinking that maybe there is a much better design Obviously we could move the policycar relation to its own table CarPolicy, benefits would bep  ul lino limit on 10 policies per carli liaddingremoving etc much easierli liwhen only the default policy is applied when no others are applied one called Default policy is applied, we could signal that by not having any entry in CarPolicy, now this is just done inserting the Default policy id in one of the columns.li ul  pThe cons are that we would need to change the DB, ORM classes etc. What would you recommendpli lipMaybe there is another smart way to implement this that we are not aware without using the CarPolicy tablepli ol

Negative 38136 pI have a page that has two drop down lists on it and a button. All controls sit in an update panel. The first drop down list ddl1 contains a lot of values which caused a huge viewstate so I disabled viewstate on it. In the page oninit event I populate the drop down list every time the page is posted back. This all seems to work fine, it shows all the values and I can access the selected value in my event handler.  p  pddl1 has the autopostback attribute set to true so when its value changes the second drop down list ddl2 is populated with some values that depend on the selection in ddl1. This also works fine, the values in ddl2 change when I select a value in ddl1. p  pddl2 does not have viewstate disabled. The button that sits under my two drop down lists is disabled by default and becomes enabled when the value of ddl2 is changed to anything except string.empty. This is where I run into problems. ddl2 does an autopostback too but it seems to lose the selected indexvalue. When Im in my code to check whether to enable or disable the button the selected index is always 0 and the selected value is string.Empty.  p  pIf I enable viewstate on ddl1 this all works fine. Could anyone point me to what Im doing wrong  p  pHere is the code executed by the ddl2 postbackp  precodeprotected void AvailableProgramsIndexChangedobject sender, EventArgs e     ToggleMoreInformationButton   private void ToggleMoreInformationButton          if Request.Browser.Type.ContainsIE                      ToggleIE                  else                      ToggleNonIE            private void ToggleIE          if this.ddlAvailablePrograms.SelectedValue  string.Empty                      this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Enabled  true             this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.CssClass  submit nongreyed                  else                      this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Enabled  false             this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.CssClass  submit greyed                private void ToggleNonIE          if this.ddlAvailablePrograms.SelectedValue  string.Empty                      this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Enabled  true             this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Style.Removeopacity             this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Style.Addopacity, 1.0                  else                      this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Enabled  false             this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Style.Removeopacity             this.careerInfoLearnMoreSubmit.Style.Addopacity, 0.5            codepre  pThe code does not modify the selected value of ddl2 at all. p  pThanks,br b3n  p
Negative 38136 pI have 4 comboboxes bound via an observable collection to 4 separate folders containing about 200 items each. When the window first loads, the filenames are stored in 4 separate observable collections, the datacontext of each combobox is set to its respective collection, then Im using a converter to convert the uri to an image with reduced quality to improve loading a bit inside the ItemTemplate.p  pWhen I run the project, the splash screen shows up for 23 seconds max. But when I try to open each combobox, it takes 2030 seconds to load all the items for the first time. So Im wondering how I can move this loading to when the splash screen is showing.p  pAlternatively, is there a way to do something beforewhile the combobox is loading its items to let the user know the app didnt freeze .. The combobox is using a wrappanel so I added a Loaded event to change a label to Done when its finished loading, but I dont know which event to use to tell the user its started loading.

Negative 38136 pI have an application where I use PHP with Zend framework and Doctrine2 as ORM. My question is related to how much the controller preferably should know about the underlying model and persistence layer. Ideally I would say this is nothing myself  the controller should not know anything about howwhen the entities are persisted. However I feel this is not always the best solution.p  pIve tried to follow the separation of concerns design guideline. Ive done this by creating a service layer that performs CRUD operations on my models. See the following examplep  precodepublic function testbuildAction               create section     sectionService  new MyAPPModelServiceAclSectionService             sectionA        sectionServicegtcreateSectionSectionANAME       create privilege with the above section     privilegeService    new MyAPPModelServiceAclPrivilegeService     privilegeA  privilegeServicegtcreatePrivilege                             sectionA,                              MyAPPFrameWorkModelAclPrivilegePERMISSIONEDIT                                create a role with the privilege above. A role must have at least one priv.     roleService  new MyAPPModelServiceAclRoleService     role         roleServicegtcreateRoleRoleNAME, privilegeA        this loads a managed User object managed by EntityManager     user  thisgthelpergtIdentityLoader      usergtaddRolerole  add the role to this user     userService  new MyAPPModelServiceCoreUserService             userServicegtupdateUseruser  persist the updates.  codepre  pAs you can see the Controller does not know anything about persistence, but to obtain this result I need to perform both persist and flush inside every call to the createXXX or updateXXX methods of the service layer. Id rather have done something like thisp  precodepublic function testbuildAction               create section     sectionService  new MyAPPModelServiceAclSectionService             sectionA        sectionServicegtcreateSectionSectionANAME       create privilege with the above section     privilegeService    new MyAPPModelServiceAclPrivilegeService     privilegeA  privilegeServicegtcreatePrivilege                             sectionA,                              MyAPPFrameWorkModelAclPrivilegePERMISSIONEDIT                                create a role with the privilege above. A role must have at least one priv.     roleService  new MyAPPModelServiceAclRoleService     role         roleServicegtcreateRoleRoleNAME, privilegeA        this loads a managed User object managed by EntityManager     user  thisgthelpergtIdentityLoader      usergtaddRolerole  add the role to this user       persist it all all serviceclasses access the same entitymanager.     roleServicegtflush  everything is persisted  codepre  pBut this causes Doctrine2 to fail as it does persist the objects to the database in the wrong order  privileges are persisted before sections dunno if I can instruct Doctrine to perform this in an ordered manner. The privileges gets wrong ID for the sections, who isnt persisted yet.p  pAnyway, the big issue here is whether I should attempt to postpone flushing until all objects have been created and relations have been set. The goal being to have ONE transaction that does all writing to the database  which consequently must be triggered by the controller since it is the only one knowing WHEN object and relation building is done, thereby contaminating the controller with knowledge of the persistence layerp

Negative 38136 pI want to code a board game that name is Okey and mostly popular in Turkey. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOkey relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOkeyap  pBut i have got some problems about AI. p  pFirslty let me explain the game..p  pThe game is played by 4 players. p  pIn this game there are 106 tiles, 2 of them are fake joker. Other 104 tiles are divided 4 colours generally green, black, blue and red.  All colours have two sets of tiles. A set ise contains 13 tiles that numbered sequentially 1 to 13.p  pEach player start 14 tiles one is start 15 and starts first and throws one of the most unwanted tile the next player. Next player can get this tile or can get another tile from stack in the middle of table. The game played in anticlockwise..p  pThe aim of this game is find the valid sequence of 14 tiles as soon as possible. Player can align tiles by sequential numbers in the same colour until 13. For examle Green 1, Green 2, Green 3. There is an exception here, 1 can be follow to 13. For example Red 12, Red 13 and Red 1 is a valid set. But Red 13, Red 1 and Red 2 is not valid.p  pOr player can align tiles by colors in the same number. For examle Green 1, Black 1, Red 1, Blue 1. p  pEach set need to be 3 or more tiles to be valid and each of this set named as Per. Less then 3 tiles is not valid for the finish. A valid finish set can be like this. G Green, BBlue, RRed, BL Black G1G2G3 B2R2BL2 R9R10R11R12 BL13R13G13p  pLast thing, when starting game a tile selected to determine joker okey. For example if you select Blue 3 Blue 4 will be joker okey and player can use this tile instead of any tile that player needs to win or complete a set per.p  pOf course these rules are general rules and summarized to explain question. If you can read Turkish, you can check out a hrefhttptr.wikipedia.orgwikiOkey relnofollowthis linka for more information or its a hrefhttptranslate.google.comtranslatejsnampprevtamphlenampieUTF8amplayout2ampeotf1ampsltramptlenampuhttptr.wikipedia.orgwikiOkey relnofollowtranslated versiona courtesy of Google Translate p  pSo which AI algorithm that i can use  I searched for minimax theory and alpha beta pruning. But these theories are generally about 2 players game like chess or tictactoe.p

Negative 38136 pIve got a codeUIScrollViewcode whose zoom behavior I want to confine to the horizontal axis. Ive accomplished that through using a custom codeUIViewcode as the codeviewForZoomingInScrollViewcode and overriding codesetTransformcode. So far so good  the view only zooms horizontally.p  pOne catch The container view includes some stretchable codeUIImagecode instances in codeUIImageViewcodes. Obviously, with the transform in effect, the images distort.p  pWhats the best bet for either redrawing the view so that the images arent distorted, or, zooming the view in such a way as to not require transforms in the first placep  pThanks for any help you can offer.p

Negative 38136 pI get the following error when I try to validate a contact page on my site  p  pstrongdocument type does not allow element script herestrongp  p  p  pemThe element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed. This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements  such as a style element in the body section instead of inside head  or two elements that overlap which is not allowed.br One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML documents. Due to HTMLs rules of implicitly closed elements, this error can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTMLs selfclosing tags for meta and link in the head section of a HTML document may cause the parser to infer the end of the head section and the beginning of the body section where link and meta are not allowed hence the reported error.em  p  hr  pI am using Joomla 1.5.7, and the doctype is p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt codepre  pAny idea how to fix thisp

Negative 38136 pThe more I use the DB Project, the less useful I find it.  Im trying to use this project type to manage my db schema and be able to use it to generate differences for testproduction schema updates.p  pRight now Im stuck trying to rename a column.  I am using the object refactor tool, which updates the refactorlog, but that log seems to have no impact on the deployment of the sql file.  Every time I deploy or diff it generates the sql as a column drop and add which purges all the existing data.  Youd think the schema diff tool would have an option to map 2 columns as a rename, but that feature is conveniently missing.p  pAlso, the Always recreate database option doesnt appear to do anything.  Regardless of the state of this checkbox, my deployed sql is exactly the same.  Which means each time I run it my database is recreated, which is contrary to what the document is telling me for unchecking this to run updates.p  pIf the db project cant do a simple rename, then its pretty much useless since I cant trust it to render the proper update sql if and when I figure out how to prevent it from recreating my database.p  pAt this point Im about to punt and just manage everything by hand, which I would prefer not to do, because contrary to my useless statement, the VS DB tools do some nice things, but 90 of the way there isnt good enough.p  pHas anyone else had experience dealing with these issues with a VS2010 DB Project who can talk me off the ledgep

Negative 38136 pStated simply my question is as follows Is it possible for a button on a worksheet in a normal excel workbook .xlsx not .xlsm to trigger a macro in another file specifically an installed excel add in .xlam.p  pHere is some background on why I want to achieve this. I have a workbook that many users need to be able to view but only some need to be able to update by filling in a form on another sheet and calling a macro in an add in. The worksheet should not contain any macros to avoid security warnings when opened by normal users. I can do this by having a ribbon button in the add in that the user clicks which will then check that the correct workbook is open and that the form is filled in etc. before executing the update code. However the interface would be nicer if the button instead of appearing on the ribbon was on the worksheet just below the form. Therefore my question is it possible to trigger an external macro from a button click in a non macro enabled workbook. p

Negative 38136 pI have a business model with many classes in, some logical entities within this model consist of many different classes Parentchildgrandchild.

I have also considered creating a visitor and having a concrete implementation to validate for OperationX and another for OperationY but dislike this because some of the constraint checks would be required for multiple operations but not all of them e.g. a Date is required for OperationXOperationY but not OperationZ and I wouldnt like to have to duplicate the code which checks.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 38136 pTrying to choose a PHP open source CMS into which I will integrate an external app. I have pretty thorough experience with Drupal and WordPress, tend to prefer WordPress for its simplicity, though I havent worked with BuddyPress. p  pIve ruled out Drupal too many features I dont need, too complex, want to try something new and thought I had it narrowed down to WPBuddyPress, until I discovered Elgg just today. Did some Googling but found no satisfactory recent comparisons between the two BuddyPress 1.2, Elgg 1.7 and very little info on Elgg in general.p  pHere are the feature requirements of the project Im working onp  pMultiple users profiles, private messaging, discussion forums, commenting, facebookSN integration and some way to create basic categories of users. Thats it.p  pThe CMS must also be as easy as possible for me to integrate deeply to an external application. The external API is for an elearning platform Im building from scratch. Most of the activity here will occur in the browser via a JSONbased API. JavaScript will query the API in realtime and update the users dashboard and various features, etc. So Im guessing it will mostly be template edits and maybe some admin modules if necessary. Users will register and login through the CMS site. The user data will be split between the CMS and the application, and obviously, Id like to not duplicate any data between the two databases other than the User ID. Additional data related to courses, games, etc. will be stored in the external app, and there will be an admin for this, separate from the CMS.p  pDue to time constraints on the project, I need the CMS communityuser features and dont have time to reinvent all those wheels myself. I also desire to make the external app as robust as possible. p  pFor these reasons I want a simple but flexible, LAMPbased CMS. Preferably welldesigned so that I can continue installing updates wo hacking the core.p  pAnyone with experience in both platforms  BuddyPress 1.2, Elgg 1.7  care to share advice on which platform would be best, wregards to my projects requirements, Im all ears Thanks.p

Negative 38136 pIve got a local webserver apache running on my laptop and it is serving up a content management system successfully.  Everything looks okay in both IE9 and Firefox.p  pToday I tried to demo it to someone and the elements were completely misaligned, looked terible in IE9.  Still looked okay in Firefox.  Tried to figure out what was wrong, even restored an earlier known good build and still messed up.  There was no wireless connection at that site and no wired connection either.p  pIm back at my place now to diagnose the issue, and there is no issue  By process of elimination, I deduced the ONLY difference between then and now is that now I am on the internet.  Bear in mind, I am NOT retrieving anything from the internet for this site.  Not that I am aware.p  pI switched off my wireless connection and immediatly my pages started rendering in screwed up fashion again.  These pages have tons of framework generated divs and CSS classes so it is not clear where the breakdown occurs... but here is my fundamental questionp  pWhat could IE9 be doing that simply shutting off my internet connection would cause it to stop rendering a locally served page properlyp

Negative 38136 pIve been dwelling with this issue for hours and couldnt figure out the problem. So Im using ASP.NET MVC 3 with Entity Framework 4.1. I am writing the account management controller and models from scratch. My problem is that whenever the Controller receives the filledup entity object from the View and sends it onwards to the Model, the Model wont save it if I try to modify any of the fields beforehand.p  pHere is the relevant portion of my model, named ModelManager.cs p  precodepublic class MemberManager      private DAL db  new DAL      public void AddMember member              member.Password  Crypto.HashPasswordmember.Password         db.Members.Addmember         db.SaveChanges      codepre  pThat model gets the codeMember membercode entity object as a parameter from the Controller, relevant portion ofwhich is belowp  precode    [HttpPost]     public ActionResult RegisterMember member                  try                              if ModelState.IsValid                                      MemberManager memberManager  new MemberManager                     if memberManager.UsernameExistmember.Username                                              memberManager.Addmember                         FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookiemember.FirstName, false                         return RedirectToActionWelcome, Home                                          else                                              ModelState.AddModelError, Username already taken.                                                                 catch                              ModelState.AddModelError, Could not complete account creation. Please try again.                           return Viewmember      codepre  pIf I remove emanyem modification to any property of the entity object in the Model, the code works i.e. I remove the line where I codeCrypto.HashPasswordcode the entity objects Password field. At first I thought the issue was with HashPassword, but if I change that line to simply change the member.Password to string 1, it wont work either. p  pSo, what am I doing wrong Im entirely new to programming so bear with me if the issue is quite flagrant. Isnt it possible to create an entity object from the View upon account creation, send it through to the Controller that then passes it on to the Model which modifies the Password to hash it before saving it p  pBTW, the exception error raised isp  blockquote   pSystem.Data.Entity.Validation.DbEntityValidationException Validation failed for one or more entities.

Negative 38136 pI have been working on a spring roo project and Ive hit a wall in terms of being able to customize the web page.p  pThe main thing I want to do is be able to dynamically hide certain fields as the client is filling out the web form.

If the user selects other I want a text box to appear so the user can fill out their own selection.p  pI was talking to someone and they said This really depends on the UI you choose. In case of MVC scaffolding you can use javascript to drive these relationships. I am indeed using MVC scaffolding so I guess I have to use javascript.

Negative 38136 pIn a web browser, I am trying to pan an image from left to right, such as a panorama.  p  pI am using jQuerymobile and its normalized events for vmousedown, vmousemove and vmouseup to detect a user touching the browser. Id like to move the image touched left and right to view around the panorama smoothly. p  pAll 3 events work fine. I keep track of the number of vmousemove events that happen and almost as many fire as the desktop. Every time the vmousemove event fires I update the images position.

Negative 38136 pI have been struggling all day with an issue. I am sure there must be some easy solution that lots have already implemented as it looks to me as a basic setup.p  pI am building an app with GWT and appengine using requestfactory. This app has some pages they are actually MVP views that everybody should have access to. Its like the home page and a couple of views where the service we provide is described. Then if you want to use the service you have to login with google accounts and all that. Only being logged in you have access to the rest of the views pages in the app. The question is, how to handle this, the fact that some pages and some requestfactory calls are public and some other have to be available to those that have logged inp  pI have already discarded the authconstraints tags in web.xml because they work with all or nothing.p  pThe next alternative was to use servlet filters as the expenses demo does. That could work, but only if the open or not secured pages didnt need to access any data from appengine datastore and I dont want to close that door, maybe in the future I want to show status or number of users, etc etc. The reason for this is that with request factory you only have one servlet so if you put a filter you shut down all comunication with appengine if the user is not logged in.p  pI was thinking of implementing this filter, with requesfactory for all the stuff once the user is logged in and also implement some RPC services for the data i might want to display in the home or information pages that i might need to retrieve from the datastore. However it looks a bit overkill for me.p  pAnother alternative is to implement a check that the user is logged in all the request factory service methods that i want to protect. But that doesnt look to elegant either...p  pAnyone had the same problem any ideasp  pId appreciate any help on this.p  pThanks,p

Negative 38136 pIs there a natural way to register modules within a module for the composite application pattern in prismp  pSay we have a module A in a prism WPF application which needs to load and register modules A1,A2,...,An.p  pIt seems to me that the approach to register all the nested modules A1 to An in the bootstrapper is a dirty one, since these modules belong to module A logically.p  pShould one load A1 to An manually in the Initialize method of A or is there a more natural approach which fits well in the general module patternp

Negative 38136 pI am very new to remoting in flex. I am using flex 4.5 and talking to a web application built by someone else on the team using AMF. They have used ZendAMF to serialize and unserialize the data.p  pOne of the main issues I am facing at the moment is that I will need to talk to a lot of services about 60 or so.p  pFrom examples on remoting I have seen online and from adobe, it seems that I need to define a remoting object for EACH servicep  precodeltmxRemoteObject idtestservice faulttestservicefaultHandlerevent showBusyCursortrue destinationaccountgt codepre  pWith so many services, I think I might have to define about 60 of those, which I dont think is very elegant.p  pAt the same time, I have been playing with Pinta to test out the AMF endpoint. Pinta seems to be able to allow one to define an arbitary amount of services, methods and parameters without any of these limitations. Digging through the source, I find that they have actually drilled down deep into the remoting and are handling a lot of low level stuff.p  pSo, the question is, is there a way to approach this problem without having to define loads or remoteobjects and without having to go down too deep and start having to handling low level remoting events ourselvesp  pCheersp

The Selected BranchGroup would have a parent TransformGroup that is attached to the root, the Unselected BranchGroup would be attached directly to the root.  As items were selected which I can do with a PickCanvas they would be removed from the Unselected BG and put in the Selected BG.p  pThe main problem with this is that the shapes jump when they are selected or unselected.

AKA How do I get the first piece of code to work properly.p  pIve tried to find an answer, which got me to the stage Im now. Its beyond my nowskill to get pass this. p

This is here to give the player option to change the balls y speed, or add spin.p  pIve tried checking for intersection between objects so that I can get a specific side, and the result is the ball just flying in the middle of the screen without actually hitting either paddle.p  pHow do I properly check for collision detection on two objects that are squares p  pHow can I fix AdjustMoveSpeed so that it works properly with collision detectionp  pLastly, how do I keep the momentum of the ball of its current speed is greater than the difference of the mouse location before and after the hitp  pIve tried taking comparing the absolute value of currentMoveSpeed and nextMoveSpeed but then the ball doesnt change y speed.

Negative 38136 pIm working on a system that will generate and store large amounts of data to disk. A previously developed system at the company used ordinary files to store its data but for several reasons it became very hard to manage.p  pI believe NoSQL databases are good solutions for us. What we are going to store is generally documents usually around 100K but occasionally can be much larger or smaller annotated with some metadata. Query performance is not top priority. The priority is writing in a way that IO becomes as small a hassle as possible. The rate of data generation is about 1Gbps, but we might be moving on 10Gbps or even more in the future.p  pMy other requirement is the availability of a preferably well documented C API. Im currently testing MongoDB. Is this a good choice If not, what other database system can I usep

Negative 38136 pMy inbrowser LED codeDisplaycode object has codeLEDcode objects stored in its codemapcode property. Each codeLEDcode has codexcode and codeycode properties so as to know where it is on canvas, while codemapcode is a 2D array of the codeLEDcodes which can be of different sizes that maps them on the codeDisplaycode matrix. The display object also has properties that define the LEDs area and the space between them. p  pThe display should be able to show characters, such as numbers and letters, from a premade font. p  pWhat I cant get my head around is what is the best way to display characters For example, here is an example of how the letter S might look like code.code is a LED display turned off, codeOcode is a LED display turned onp  precode..OO.. .OOOO.

When we need to show a character, we get the codeCharactercodes codexcode and codeycode, find the source LED and then switch the codeLEDcodes on as mapped. p  pIs there a better way Using paths, perhapsp

Negative 38136 pI am working with OSGi and declarative services DS and am currently thinking of how to handle the logging properly.

Ok so far. But how would I differentiate the service components The LogService object contains a reference to the BundleContext naturally, but looking into the LogService interface a ServiceReference must be given by the user the one who actually logs something itself This seems fragile to me. Why cant the framework deliver this as it delivers the BundleContextp  pAnd while Im at it, why does the OSGi spec use the verbose codelogger.logLogService.LOGINFO,...code instead of the quasistandard codelogger.info..., logger.warn..code etc. Is there some specific reason for thatp

Any help is appreciated, even if its likely from a simple mistake.p  precodeimport java.util. public class EnterLibrary   public static void LibraryMenu              java.util.Scanner scannerObject new java.util.ScannerSystem.in         LibraryMenu Menu  new LibraryMenu         Menu.displayMenu         switch scannerObject.nextInt                       case 1                              System.out.println 1  Add Videos                 Library[] newLibrary                 newLibrary  createLibrary                          break             case 2                 System.out.println 2  Search Videos                 searchLibrarynewLibrary                 break             case 3                              System.out.println 3  Change Videos                     Change video method TBA                          break                   case 4                 System.out.println 4  Delete Videos                 deleteVideonewLibrary                 break             default                 System.out.println Unrecognized option  please select options 13                  break                public static Library[] createLibrary      Library[] videos  new Library[4]     java.util.Scanner scannerObject new java.util.ScannerSystem.in      for int i  0 i lt videos.length i              User enters values into set methods in Library class         System.out.printEnter video number   i1  n         String number  scannerObject.nextLine         System.out.printEnter video title   i1  n         String title  scannerObject.nextLine         System.out.printEnter video publisher   i1  n         String publisher  scannerObject.nextLine         System.out.printEnter video duration   i1  n         String duration  scannerObject.nextLine         System.out.printEnter video date   i1  n         String date scannerObject.nextLine         System.out.printVIDEO   i1   ENTRY ADDED   n n         Initialize arrays         videos[i]  new Library          videos[i].setVideo number, title, publisher, duration, date            return videos   public static void printVidLibrary Library[] videos      Get methods to print results     System.out.printnVIDEO CATALOGUE n     for int i  0 i lt videos.length i              System.out.printVideo number   i1   n  videos[i].getNumber  n          System.out.printVideo title   i1   n  videos[i].getTitle  n          System.out.printVideo publisher   i1   n  videos[i].getPublisher  n          System.out.printVideo duration   i1   n  videos[i].getDuration  n          System.out.printVideo date   i1   n  videos[i].getDate  n         public static Library searchLibrary Library[] videos      User enters values to setSearch     Library titleResult  new Library     java.util.Scanner scannerObject new java.util.ScannerSystem.in      for int n  0 n lt videos.length n              System.out.printlnSearch for video numbern         String newSearch  scannerObject.nextLine         titleResult.getSearch videos, newSearch          if titleResult.equals1                  System.out.printMatch foundn  newSearch  n                  else if titleResult.equals1                  System.out.printSorry, no matches foundn                   return titleResult   public static void deleteVideo Library[] videos      Library titleResult  new Library     java.util.Scanner scannerObject new java.util.ScannerSystem.in      for int n  0 n lt videos.length n              System.out.printlnSearch for video numbern         String deleteSearch  scannerObject.nextLine         titleResult.deleteVideovideos, deleteSearch         System.out.printVideo deletedn          public static void mainString[] args      Library[] newLibrary      new LibraryMenu   codepre
Negative 38136 pI am trying to localize my Settings.bundle. There does not appear to be anything in Xcode 4 that allows you to add localization to the Settings.bundle similar to localizing a xib file. So I used finder to navigate to the Settings.bundle and copied the en.lproj directory to create directories in the bundle called fr.lproj and de.lproj. From there, you can modify the strings file to localize the titles in the Root.plist.p  pBut the problem is that the new directory is not under source code control. If I try to add the directory to source code control, I get the following error The operation could not be performed because the selection is invalid.p  pHow can I resolve this problem and get the new settings.bundle directory under source code controlp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPzU1v.png altBelow is an image of the localized directories I added to my Settings.bundle.

Negative 38136 pI have written a library and I use that library in a program. I often make a change in the program code, run tests with asserts turned on and then if the tests pass I run a benchmark with asserts turned off to measure the performance impact of the change I just made. I also want to turn the asserts on in my library for the tests and to turn them off in the library for the benchmark. So I frequently need to switch the assert setting simultaneously in the program and the library.p  pMatching the assert settings NDEBUG for the library and the program that uses the library must not be manual because getting it wrong means undefined behavior as there are asserts in the headers conflicting definitions causes undefined behavior and indeed I get a crashing program with GCC when I build an assertoff program with an asserton library. I havent been able to find out what the standard way to do this is. Im considering having my library build system install two binaries and possibly headers that complain if they are included with the wrong assert setting NDEBUG named libfoo1.0 and libfooassert1.0 or something like that.p  pWhat is the best way to match the assert setting between libraries and programs in such a way that switching the assert setting in both at the same time is easy, fast and not error pronep

Instead of creating 2 fragments and using a Choice subform, I was hoping there was a way to create a single fragment that had the phone number dynamically generate based on some property.p  pIs there any way to do what Im thinking, or do I have to stick with 2 separate fragments  a choice subformp  hr  pFurther clarificationp  pMy thought is this... if I can have the fragment use script to dynamically set the text of the phone number field, that would be great. The forms themselves would set some sort of variable or custom property or something that the fragment could use in its script.p

Negative 38136 pSome C source code I wrote compiled and ran fine on Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2010. But when I tried it on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion using XCode 4.4.1, it would not compile. I was able to fix it as detailed below, but am interested to find out what I was doing wrong in the first place and why the fix was needed.p  pSpecifically, consider the following class declaration p  precodeclass airline      vector ltpassengergt persons     int npassengers public     airline       airline int np     airline        other functions   codepre  pThe constructor for codeairlinecode that takes an int parameter isp  precodeairlineairline int np      npassengers  np     persons.resize npassengers     return  codepre  pOn the Windows machine, this compiled and ran with no problems. However, XCode complained bitterly that I did not have a viable constructor for passenger. I have a default constructor for passenger, so that wasnt the issue. Based on something I found in an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9664438nomatchingconstructorforinitialisationofvaluetypeearlier question on this sitea I also tried using persons.erase instead of resize, with no luck. p  pUltimately I was able to get the code to compile on the Mac by using codepersons.vectorresize npassengerscode instead of codepersons.resize npassengerscode. I am wondering why it was necessary to do that on the Mac side, and why it worked without a problem on the Windows side. p  pA related question is, is it bad practice to have codeusing namespace stdcode at the top of your code, and instead, should I be specifying codestdcoutcode etc. If so, why p  pPlease bear with my lack of knowledge, and thanks for your helpp  pEdit Sean suggested I show my code for passenger, so here goes p  precodeclass passenger      string plast     string pfirst     int  row     char seatno     int flightno public     passenger      passengerstring line      passenger passenger const amprhs     passenger      passengerpassenger passenger const amprhs      plast  rhs.plast     pfirst  rhs.pfirst     row  rhs.row     seatno  rhs.seatno     flightno  rhs.flightno      return   passengerpassenger string line        tokenizes string to obtain passenger data      seems to work fine, actual code is too long to include      and doesnt seem relevant here   passengerpassenger      plast.clear     pfirst.clear     row  0     seatno  0     flightno  0      return  codepre  pPlus of course the usual accessors and overloaded insertion operator, etc. Thanksp

Negative 38136 pCurrently we are storing static datae.g. gender, marital status, state etc.. into DB by creating different lookup tables gender, state etc.... We have almost close to 10 lookup tables. All these tables are FK to transaction table  userwhich stores all users demographic info. Some of these static data are also used by other transaction tables. Now while fetching a user info we normally put a join to these tables and get the related text. Certainly these many joins can create performance issues and also as per MSDN we shouldnt have more than 5 joins in a select query. Now to avoid this we can move all the static data to xml file and read it from them. Certainly we will cache the xml data so it will be only read once. I would like to know is that a good approach. I can see the below trade offs 1 Cannot maintain referential intergrity. 2 while using load balancing all the servers need to have the xml file.p  pI dont want the values to be in enum as these needs to be localized. the only advantage i see keeping in xml is that it reduces overhead to DBcreating 10 tables. I can very well cache the static data stored in DB. So would like to know that still storing data in xml is a good choice over DB  p  pPS Application is Web app and developed in .net 3.5.p
Negative 38136 pI run really complex reporting from the database. So far I was returning a complex json object and javscript was rendering the report. But as its growing more creating this json object is taking really long time .p  pI am thinking to replace this with another approach . User will create a request to generate report and a server side process can generate json and store it for later use and user will be emailed a link. p  pIs it safe approach to store json object in database  Main reason to store it is that columns that user is going to run report on are never fixed . Should I rather go for NoSql p  pThanks in advance .p

Negative 38136 pI am building a tree structure in PHP and I could leave it as an array, or turn it into a tree of objects.  I think there will be much better performance if I leave it as an array, but Im not sure.p  pIn the case of an array, the owning object would have a reference to the root element, and thats it.  The root element would contain subarrays which may, in turn, contain their own subarrays.p  pIn the case of objects, my mapper would need to instantiate them on load, and for every child object their would be a reference from its parent.  For a 300 node tree, this would mean 299 references, as opposed to 1 when using arrays.p  pSo, it seems to me that the performance would be much better if I use arrays rather than objects.  Is this correct  Its important because sacrificing the behaviour of objects will be a considerable trade off in this case.p

Negative 38136 pI have to write a Prolog program for solving a cryptarithmetic puzzle.p  pI need to write a function solve[A, M, P, D, Y] which assigns the variables [A, M, P, D, Y] to values from 0 to 9 so that it satisfies the equation AMPMDAY. Each variable is assigned to a different value, and A, P, and D cannot be equal to 0.p  pI started writing this function, but ran into problems running my program. I set the restrictions of A, P, and D not being zero. As I was going through the algorithm, I realized that D has to be 1, so I defined that in the beginning of my program. I defined two different variables for M M1 and M2 and set them equal to each other, since the different Ms in the puzzle should be assigned to the same value. I assigned locations to the different variables and added them up based on the puzzle. I accounted for any variables being carried with carry in variables. My program compiles but the function does not execute.p  precodesolve[A, M1, M2, P, D, Y] D is 1, A0, P0, D0, M1  M2, selectM1, [0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], R1, selectM2, R1, R2, Y is M1M2 mod 10, C1 is M1M2  10, selectY, R2, R3, selectA, R3, R4, selectP, R4, R5, selectD, R5, R6, A is APC1 mod 10, D is APC1 10. codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there something wrong with my variable definitions Do I need to define two different M variables, or is one sufficientp

Negative 38136 pIm using some versioning techniques in web api that will basically call a controller based on a specified api version in the header. So the scenario, lets say we have an entry point called apiGetSalesHistory but our server guys me had to change the request contract in order for us to do what we need to do. In some cases, this becomes a breaking change such as a new required field, or a single value that has been changed to a list, hence the versioning. p  pSo, my routing selector will look in the header for an api version and then call the correct controller. The version 1 controller has a parameter type of the version 1 request, and the version 2 controller has a parameter type of the version 2 request.p  pHeres the problem. Out of the box, the controller will run regardless of the payload you send it. Back in WCF, if you sent in the wrong object, serialization would fail causing the entire request to fail. Right now, what happens is if I send the version 1 payload to the version 2 controller, instead of failing serialization or failing the request, itll create an instance of the version 2 request with empty fields and then continue to run. So the parameter doesnt come in as null, so I cant simply say ifrequest  null explodep  pHow do I force the controller to reject the request if the expected payload is not receivedp

Negative 38136 pI saw a few posts referencing a similar issue, but not quite the same thing.p  pHere is a snippet from the top of my routes file.p  pIm wondering if the approach Im using works to call global events on each of the routes. The events Im using are pretty standard, simple events like clearing the items container.p  pAs you can see, Im calling on the all event in the constructor, and then pointing to several methods defined in the routes file.p  pMy question is, say I want the same global event on several screens say, all of the catalog screens. Ive been doing some strange and admittedly hacky tricks to get the oup  precoderouteName  route.split[1]   only substantiate the dropdown on User Catalog screen. if routeName is catalogScreen or routeName is catalogPDFScreen codepre  pAs Im sure you can imagine, this is not ideal, nor is it particularly clean. Im just trying to find ways to DRY up my router file to catch all of these global events, and this was the best I could think of.p  precoderoutes                                            homeScreen   catalogs                                 catalogsScreen   catalogsid                             catalogScreen   catalogsidpagepageid               catalogScreen   catalogsidpdf                         catalogPDFScreen   catalogsidpdfpagepageid           catalogPDFScreen   catalogsidcategorycategoryid       categoryScreen   departmentsid                          departmentScreen   notifications                            notificationsScreen   settings                                 settingsScreen   productsid                             productScreen   catalogcatalogidsearchsearchquery searchCatalogScreen   searchsearchquery                     searchScreen   login                                    loginScreen   membersmemberidcatalogscatalogid  userCatalogScreen   membersmemberid                       profileScreen   usernamecatalogname                   extends router class to allow storing of routes for a history constructor options gt   on all, storeRoute   on all, clearAlerts   on all, clearScroll   on all, setSearch   on all, setNav codepre  pThanks in advance for anyones help on this Im growing more and more experienced with Backbone but I obviously have some stuff to learn.p

Negative 38136 pI was wondering if there was a way to create a popup dialog in JavaScript without using codealert, confirm, promptcode or codewindow.opencodep  pThe reason why is because I want to be able to put anything inside the dialog. Any content. E.g. a text box, codedivcode, formatted content, or however many input buttons I wish and have with whatever text, and none of the codealert, confirm,code or codepromptcode allows you to do this. codepromptcode only allows for a text box. And codealertcode and codeconfirmcode only allow its preset buttons and plain text. I dont want to use codewindow.opencode because it relocates to either a different url, or the same url with the same functionality. p  pAnother thing is that all of the given options ialertsi the user, hence the function name codealertcode and codepromptcode I want something thats a little less intrusive.p  pThe reason I dont want to use a jQuery plugin or make my own plugin is because I want the dialog to have a GUI native to the OS.p  pNow, I have never seen this used by ianyonei, and I would say I have adequate experience in web surfing and referencing. So if this is impossible, then another acceptable answer would be to have an codealertcode or codeconfirmcode or codepromptcode with i customize able i buttons however many I want with whatever caption values. p  pbEDITb The reasoning behind this request is because I have been taking computer science courses lately involving C and Python 2, which has the ability to do this by invoking the System GUI, but I am more comfortable with the browserclient side architecture. That and I am also just curious.p  pbEDIT 2b I dont wish to use plugins which can be manipulated in drastic ways. I am interested in what I can do with the bsystemb not what I can do with ihacksi.p

Negative 38136 pI have recently been asked to produce a simple module for the marketing module of a website, I have been asked to produce a very specific set of results with the raw data accessible via a MySQL database.

Every action of the user is logged from logging in to logging out, the number of people who visit the site on a daily basis only allow this system to run for about 2days before the data is archived into another table, in total we have 100 tables plus the live, giving me roughly 202 days of data to work with at any one time.p  pSo here is my question.p  pWith the size amount of data that these tables store and the sheer number of archives tables which may or may not be limited to 100, and the client wants ALL the numbers displayed to the screen based on the actions of a specific page how would you recommend going about thisp  pQuerying directly with SQL may or may not be possible based on the database setup so I have considered a few options from XML to serializing the data into a file structure using a chron based on page and data, but ultimately Im not 100 which route I should take, so I thought to ask, does anyone have any better ideas and if so please share.p  pThanks in advance to anyone and everyone who replies.p

However, it doesnt work in all browsers, and sometimes we have to reboot if it is no longer working on a particular machine.p  pAfter a lot of searching, Im really not sure how to improve my code while keeping all the functionality contained within a single html file. I would really appreciate some input. p  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtGain Access Beta version 1.0lttitlegt ltstylegt       fontfamily Verdana, Arial, SansSerif  top     marginleft80px  heading      marginleft 0px     fontsize22px     fontweightbold  subhead      marginleft 10px     fontsize12px  button      fontsize16px     marginleft100px  button      fontsize 12px     fontfamily Verdana, Arial, SansSerif     position absolute     marginleft 100px     margintop 50px  status      marginleft90px     margintop 80px     position absolute     fontsize16px     fontweightbold  knocks      marginleft110px     margintop 100px     position absolute     fontsize14px     colorblue   portals      position absolute     marginleft 110px     margintop 155px     displaynone  .tinyimg      width 1px     height 1px   ltstylegt ltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquerylatest.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   document.readyfunction button.clickfunction     knocks.appendltpgtKnocking...ltpgt     setTimeoutfunction         portals.appendltimg classtinyimg srchttpssome.url.com1111testurl.jpg gt         knocks.appendltpgtKnock 1 of 5 complete...ltpgt         , 500         setTimeoutfunction         portals.appendltimg classtinyimg srchttpssome.url.com2222testurl.jpg gt         knocks.appendltpgtKnock 2 of 5 complete...ltpgt         , 3500     setTimeoutfunction         portals.appendltimg classtinyimg srchttpssome.url.com3333testurl.jpg gt         knocks.appendltpgtKnock 3 of 5 complete...ltpgt         , 6500     setTimeoutfunction         portals.appendltimg classtinyimg srchttpssome.url.com4444testurl.jpg gt         knocks.appendltpgtKnock 4 of 5 complete...ltpgt         , 9500     setTimeoutfunction         portals.appendltimg classtinyimg srchttpssome.url.com5555testurl.jpg gt         knocks.appendltpgtKnock 5 of 5 complete...ltpgt         , 12000     setTimeoutfunction         knocks.appendltpgtKnocking is complete... ltbrgtProceed to site lta hrefhttpsecureurl.someurl.comgthttpsecureurl.someurl.comagtltpgt         , 13000     ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idtopgt ltpgtltspan idheadinggtGain Accessltspangtltbrgtltspan idsubheadgtBeta version 1.0ltspangtltpgt ltdivgt ltbutton typebuttongtClick to Knockltbuttongt ltdiv idportalsgtltdivgt ltThe image references created by the port knocks land in this div.gt ltp idstatusgtStatusltpgt ltdiv idknocksgtltpgtClick button to knockltpgtltdivgt ltThe status updates generated concurrently with each port knock are displayed here.gt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Obviously its different to the others because we dont want to find an exact match, we want a single match from several possible keywords.p  pCan anyone help Rookie question I know but Ive been working on it for a while.p

Negative 38136 pI have a frustrating issue here. Not really sure what is causing it. My Drupal site is running on a Windows server with IIS 7. When I go to the a hrefhttpexample.comadmin relnofollowhttpexample.comadmina page I get a 403 error. However, if I login with a hrefhttpexample.comquser relnofollowhttpexample.comqusera then go to admin it works fine. Im guessing theres something wrong with a setting in IIS or theres some kind of permission that is wrong.

Negative 38136 pI am a beginner, both in C programming and on Stackoverflow, and I need to make my BlackJack odds simulator, which uses 1 core and 25 of my i5 CPU, run faster  ideally 34 times faster.  I am overwhelmed by all the different ways of parallelizing a loop, the outermost loop in the most CPU intensive function of this program which had been working fine, albeit slowly, without paralellization.  I am running my program on Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and I tried the parallelized for loop provided by  and the concurrency library, but when I tested it out, instead of getting exactly 4 threads and 100 cpu usage like I wanted, the task manager showed the process shuffling around with different numbers of threads and different amounts of CPU usage, and it didnt perform as fast as I wanted.  I tested out the Microsoft autoparallelization and autovectorization features using the examples given on  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh872235.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh872235.aspxa , but there were many constrains no conditional statements, function calls, creating and assigning variables, incremental in the middle of a loop, etc that kept me from using it, so I decided that it would probably not work out for my very complicated loop.  Although using Microsofts pragma loophintparallel0 autoparallelization feature was super fast, automatically created exactly 4 threads, one for each core, from the start of the program and consistently made use of 100 of the CPU usage, which is what I think would be ideal  I dont think it fits my task. p  pEach simulation, or loop, in my program is completely independent from the rest because all the variables that the result of a simulation is based on  number of cards in the deck, number of 2s, number of 3s, etc  are the same at the end of a run of the simulation as they were at the beginning of a run of the simulation  if every variable and vector was not cleanly put back the way it was, an assert statement would go off.  The only variable that is different from one iteration of the outermost loop to the next is the double expected outcome or mean, and for my purposes I think I would like each element 10 elements, 1 for drawing each type of card in BlackJack valued 2 through 11 in the outermost loop to have its own expected outcome variable OR for the expected outcome variable to be an atomic double that is modified by different threads.  At the end of a simulation, if there are 10 different thread local expected outcome variables, for initially drawing cards valued two through ace, I want that expected outcome variable to be returned to main and combined with the other expected outcome variables to get the end result  your house edge.p  pSo how should I go about multithreading  Which library libraries would you make use of if you were in my position  Can I make 1 thread take the first value in the loop, the second thread take the second, the third thread take the third, the fourth thread take the fourth, and then have thread 1 take the fifth value in the for loop when it is finished with the first iteration of the loop  Should I use a fixed number of threads, or a thread pool not that I fully understand concepts like threadpool yet  Should I make separate thread local variables expectedoutcome1, expectedoutcome2 or should I use something with locks  Can I make automatic parallelization work in my function despite its complexityp  pOne little final thing on the side.  My original version of this program was recursive, with a function in which the dealer DrawsCard, and if dealerScore lt hard17  soft16 , recurse DrawCard.  The nice part about recursion was that the code was more compact than using a bunch of loops, although it may have been slower.  I also found it harder to catch and fix errors in the middle of the stack than errors in the middle of a nested loop.  And loops never accidentally went into superdeep or infinite recursion. But if I want people to read my code, having roughly 15 nested loops might not go to well, so I might want to make it tail recursive for clarity and then have the recursive calls optimized into loops.  Would it be easy to parallelize or autoparallelize a tail recursive function, as easy as it would be to parallelize a for loop  Because if so, I would hope to get rid of nested loops all together.p

Negative 38136 pI have gone through all the procedures on how to compile V8 and actually managed to compile it on Windows platform. However, the problem is that the compilation procedure on Windows forces you to compile with Visual Studio and therefore creates object files .obj which can be used in VS. I have managed to create a DLL file too but it only serves the purpose when there is an executable to run. p  pOn the other hand, I am using Eclipse and g on Windows. To embed V8 into my C I will need to have a library file .a extension so that the linker will work. Is there a way that this is doablep

Negative 38136 pI setup a few BLE connections in my view controller, SViewController, and I need to store the peripherals for use in other view controllers. Ive tried creating an NSUserDefault object and storing the peripherals in there, but I got the error codeAttempt to insert nonproperty valuecode, and it never inserted. I then tried wrapping it up in an NSData object and storing it in NSUserDefaults, but got the error code[CBConcretePeripheral encodeWithCoder] unrecognized selector sentcode and the app crashed. So that definitely did not work. Ive also tried making the three CBPeripheral variables global, but I ran into a ton of issues with that. Im still very new to programming. I then looked into somehow caching them, but have read on here that it will not work and to not waste the time.p  pDoes anyone know how to store a CBPeripheral object so that I can access it and initialize it in other view controllersp
Negative 38136 pIm writing a Linux program using Qt 4.8 and libusb 1.0 which will communicate with a custom USB device currently being programmed by a coworker.p  pStep 1 is to have a heartbeat going back and forth over USB at regular intervals. Im currently using asynchronous bulk transfer.p  pFor testing, Ive put my SendHeartbeat on a button click. If I click on the button a LOT and queue up a number of messages to send, as long as I keep my queue busy, the messages keep sending and my USB device keeps receiving them.p  pIf I stop for a few seconds, then resume and add more messages to the queue, the USB device stops receiving them.p  pBUT, my programs Transfer Callback DOES return with a transfer status code of 0, indicating success, even though my USB device isnt receiving them.p  pMy questionsp  ol liWhy does the callbacks transfer status indicate success if my USB device appears to have stopped receiving themli liHas anyone heard of this type of behaviourli ol  pIts worth noting that if I disconnect the USB device, I get proper status codes returned in my callback indicating that the device has gone away.p  pIf the USB Device is left connected and running, and I Detatch and then again Attach to force a reconnection and try sending more test heartbeats, it works The USB device starts receiving messages again. p  pMy Detatch is the following calls p  precodelibusbreleaseinterface libusbresetdevice libusbclose codepre  pThen my Attach is p  precodelibusbgetdevicelist libusbgetdevicedescriptor libusbopen libusbsetconfiguration libusbclaiminterface codepre  pMy next step is to narrow down which of the libusb commands is reestablishing the communication.p  pMeanwhile, Im hoping someone recognizes these symptoms and has a suggestion. As its my first time programming USB communication, Im wondering if there is some fundamental which Ive missed.  p  pThanksp

Negative 38136 pFirst, my apologies for posting this entire block of code. I think its important to be able to answer my broad question.p  pI have this application. It collects data eventually from an external source, but randomly generated strings for now and logs it to a MySQL database singlecolumn table. p  pThere are 2 threads plus the main thread. One thread collects data simcollectData and puts it in a Queue. The second thread takes the data from the queue and puts it in the DB logData. p  pMy question concerns robustness and errorhandling with the database IO stuff. This is going to be running in a remote location with minimal human interaction for extended periods of time, and so needs to be pretty robust.p  pWhat can I do to ensure that database issues dont cause this to fail Its not a huge deal of a record or two is lost occasionally, but it needs to be able to recover. The MySQL database server will be running locally, so I dont think I need to be terribly worried about losing the connection is that a valid assumption. What about issues related to a failed writep  pIm also curious does it make sense for the logging thread to start and control the DB connection, or is it something that should be created in the main thread and passed to the logging thread as necessaryp  precodedef simcollectDatainputqueue, stopevent      this provides some output simulating the serial     data from the data logging hardware.           while not stopevent.isset          generate a random string         lst  [random.choicestring.asciiletters for n in xrangerandom.randint15,40]         data  .joinlst          inputqueue.putDATA  data           wait a random time         stopevent.waitrandom.randint1,5      inputqueue.putNone  send a signal telling the logging thread were done     print [collection thread] Terminated data collection.     return  def logDatainputqueue       make the database connection     try         con  mdb.connectlocalhost, databaseuser, password, databasename         cur  con.cursor     except mdb.Error, e         print Error d s  e.args[0],e.args[1]         sys.exit1       log the data     while True         d  inputqueue.get         if d is None             inputqueue.taskdone             print [logging thread] Finished logging.             con.close             return          if d.startswithDATA             data  d[4]  remove DATA             sqlquery  INSERT INTO exampledata VALUESs  data             with con                 cur  con.cursormdb.cursors.DictCursor                 cur.executesqlquery                 inputqueue.taskdone   def main     inputqueue  Queue.Queue       used to signal termination to the thread     stopevent  threading.Event        start the logging and data collection threads         print [main] Starting data collection thread...     collectionthread  threading.ThreadtargetsimcollectData, argsinputqueue, stopevent     collectionthread.start     print Done.      print [main] Starting logging thread...     loggingthread  threading.ThreadtargetlogData, argsinputqueue,     loggingthread.start     print Done.       listen for keyboard interrupts     try         while True             time.sleep10     except KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit          stop data collection.

First, make sure the service you want is enabled under Services. Then go to API Access and specify your calling domains or IP addresses. When I try to add my domain to the notification endpoints, it doesnt do it.p  pIn addition, I see that it says Allows webhook notifications to be sent to external domains that are owned by the user. Google verifies that the user does in fact own each of the listed domains via Webmaster Tools in the box where you add said endpoints. Since I am on an Amazon EC2 instance I am not sure that I will be able to do that. I really hope the fact that I am on an Amazon server is not stopping me from making my app.p  pAny help would be appreciated, thank you all.p

Negative 38136 pI have recently a couple of months ago changed jobs and have inherited a codebase which violates every single one of the SOLID principles as many times as it possibly can. It seems as though the people who wrote this code decided to study every single good coding practice in detail and violate them all as often and most radically as they possibly could.p  pI am the sole developer of this product  there is no one left in the organisation who knows the code and the codebase is too large and complex to completely rewrite. I am looking at the highest value changes that I can make to make the codebase flexible and robust. It is not an option to abandon this product either.p  pThe root of all problems in the product stems from a group of classes which are the core business logic data structures. There is a lot of problems with these classes, but what I am really interested in is the followingp  precodepublic static class NetCollection      private static Logger LogFile  get  return Logger.GetMethodLogger2        Declare local variables.     private static Dictionaryltstring, NetObjectgt netObjectHashTable     private static Dictionaryltstring, NetTitlegt titlePropertyHashTable     private static Dictionaryltstring, NetObjectgt referenceDataHashTable     private static Dictionaryltint, SortedDictionaryltstring, intgtgt picklistHashTable      public static IEnumerableltNetObjectgt NetObjects              get                      return netObjectHashTable.Values                    static NetCollection              netObjectHashTable  new Dictionaryltstring, NetObjectgt         titlePropertyHashTable  new Dictionaryltstring, NetTitlegt         referenceDataHashTable  new Dictionaryltstring, NetObjectgt         picklistHashTable  new Dictionaryltint, SortedDictionaryltstring, intgtgt           public static void AddNetObjectNetObject newObject              if newObject  null             return         if newObject.TitleType  Reference Data                       Check if hash table contains key             if referenceDataHashTable.ContainsKeynewObject.ID.ToString                              referenceDataHashTable.AddnewObject.ID.ToString, newObject                               else                       Check if hash table contains key             if netObjectHashTable.ContainsKeynewObject.ID.ToString                              netObjectHashTable.AddnewObject.ID.ToString, newObject                             codepre  pI have snipped quite a number of other methods from this class for the sake of brevity.p  pAs you can see, there are a huge number of issues around this class storing state in a static class is a huge code smell  writing your entire application around said class is just crazy.p  pMy current intention is to refactor this class into a proper singleton class and eventually into a regular class so that I can enable the user to open multiple documents simultaneously.p  pShould I do thisp  pWhat are the biggest risks with making this change Are there any approaches that I can take to mitigate the risk of making this changep

Negative 38136 pI am building a database using db4o that contains files and information about the files, but want to do so in a way that does not require a file system behind it I specifically want a file system to not exist because of the complexity of the file relations there would be no way to design such a file system in an intelligent way for the web of items we work with. p  pSo I know that the codeFilecode class is a pointer to a file in a file system, but I want the actual file to be encompassed in the object Im working with.

Negative 38136 pIm working on a Raspberry Pi based project that has a GPS module which my boss wants me to get the time from for the system clock. However we also need to take readings on different sensors whilst the GPS may not have a fix, and we need to know to the millisecond precision tolerance of 50100ms is fine when these readings were taken.p  pPersonally I want a hardware RTC for this, but Ive been instructed to work around it. My idea is to mark each reading with a relative time from system boot, the system time is not reliable, and is updated by NTPSatellite time when available I can then fixup the records when a synchronized time is available using the relative time.p  pSo, how can I get a millisecond precise uptime in Linux from userspace C code Something like the jiffies value available in the kernel would be perfect.p

Negative 38136 pI have used the builtin samplingbased performance profiler of VS 2010 successfully in the past. Sometimes the highlighted code in the code window was off by a couple of lines. That might have been due to code optimization, which the profiler is said not to handle very well. Other than that, it worked for me in contrast to the instrumenting variantp  pHowever, this time the results are just plain wrong. For instance, there is stronga single line in my code a call to another method that results in a DB query that accounts for 40 of the total run timestrong, and which I found by the comment out code bisection method.p  pThe strongsampling profilerstrong of VS2012 and VS2010, I double checked however tells me the method accounts strongfor something like 1 inclusivestrong, i.e. it does not even show up in the report summary and I have to search to the bottom of the detail tables to find it. I cranked up the sampling frequency just in case, to no avail.p  pWhat could throw the profiler this far offp  pI am profiling a .net 3.5 based project, with a fair number of dlls. I tried profiling in both Release and Debug mode. No substantial difference.p

Ive added constraints to all of my UI elements and I cant, for whatever reason, add a height constraint to the self.tableHeaderView via the nib.p  pI tried changing the frame of the self.tableHeaderView programmatically but that has no effect when i run the code in simulator, which makes sense because if I use Autolayout, it should ignore the frame changes.p  pI tried adding a height constraint programmatically but it crashes.p  pThis is the piece of code Ive to add the height constraint.p  precode    [self.tableHeaderView addConstraint[NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemself.tableHeaderView attributeNSLayoutAttributeHeight relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual toItemnil attributeNSLayoutAttributeNotAnAttribute multiplier1.0f constant107.0f]] codepre  pThe exception i got emem Assertion failure in [UITableView layoutSublayersOfLayer], SourceCacheUIKitSimUIKit2903.2UIView.m8536p  hr  pstrong Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException, reason Auto Layout still required after executing layoutSubviews.

What are the maven dependencies that one should use insteadp  p3 Im still not sure about differences between embedded and standalone way to integrate Solr into existing web app. As I understood, standalone way means to deploy Solr war file as a separate application. In this case we shouldnt specify any servlets or filter and just use Solrj to connect to running instance of Solr.p  pWhat is changing when we want to run Solr as part of our app We need to add more dependencies, not just Solrj. And we need to initialize somehow Solr core. Am I correctp

To connect to the dbase tables from visual Studio, i use OLEDB JET 4.0 and Im having troubles querying my table against boolean values.p  pLets say my table contains an integer and a boolean field or Logical field p  precode1 true 2 NULL 3 false codepre  pcodeSELECT  from mytablecode will display in the bottom grid of visual studiop  precode1 true 2 false 3 false codepre  pNULL seems to default to false BDE used to do the same, which is fine by me. I think NULL values for a boolean field dont make sens anyway.  But then p  pcodeSELECT  from mytable where field2 IS NOT NULLcode displays the same resultp  pcodeSELECT  from mytable where field2 IS NULLcode displays an empty resultsetp  pand the best  p  pcodeSELECT  from mytable where field2  truecode will display in the bottom gridp  precode1 true 2 false codepre  pso the question is  do NULL values for boolean type default to true  and the grid is just misbehaving by displaying them as false or does is default to false  in which case my oledb dll might be outdated or buggy why not p

Negative 38136 pI am currently working on an online shop with WooCommerce. I faced the problem that I want to grant a discount to customers who chose a specific shipping method. The discount is 0.50 for every single product. I basically solved this problem with the following code in my strongfunctions.phpstrong p  precodeaddactionwoocommercebeforecalculatetotals, wooaddcartfee  function wooaddcartfee       global woocommerce     cart  woocommercegtcartgtgetcart     Calculating Quantity     foreach cart as cartval gt cid          qty  cid[quantity]           if woocommercegtcartgtshippinglabel  specific shipping method          woofee  qty  0.5         wooname  discount for specific shipping method           woocommercegtcartgtaddfeewooname, woocommerce, woofee, true  codepre  pThe code technically works, the only problem I have now is that if a customer changes the shipping method i.e. from the specific shipping method to a normal one without any discount or the other way round, it always displays and calculates the discount value from the previously chosen shipping method. In other words it is always one step back and therefore displays the customer the wrong total amount.p  pDoes anyone has an idea to solve this problemp

Negative 38136 pI am requested to create a web service, which uses POST instead of GET and so there should be no query string.  When a POST request is sent to myservice a single JSON object will be passed with an attribute called numbers.        Im thinking that this specification calls for a form which has just two fields, one a text field to hold the numbers, separated by commas, and a submit button field.br 1 Should I use JavaScript andor JQuery to get the numbers out of the form field and convert them into a JSON object        Specifically, the person enters into the form field, with nameid of numbers, the numbers 2, 3, 4. This needs to be turned into something like thisp  precode   numbers [      2, 3, 4    ]   codepre  pThen I guess I would or could use JQuerys ajax methods to send the JSON data string to the  php web service that exists at a hrefhttpmydomain.commyservice relnofollowhttpmydomain.commyservicea It needs to be sent with no query parameters, as mentioned.  The service would return a json object representing the sum of all the numbers, the product of all the numbers, and the average or mean.

I can have the form post to the same page and then can I have JQuery check to see if the form was posted, and if so then convert the numbers, entered into the form, into a JSON object.  Does JavaScript have access to the POST variable Or should I use an event handler to respond to a click on the form submit button.  But how do I get the data entered by the user and convert that into a JSON object with a parameter of numbersp  pThen on the server side, I need to parse the JSON object, perform the operations on the array of numbers, and then create the JSON result object to be returned.br Can someone offer some advice, please  I dont know if I should do the whole thing in PHP or if it is better to do some clientside JQueryJavaScript processing to create the JSON object.

Negative 38136 pIm trying to use VLCs HTTP interface to read the current playlist codeGET requestsplaylist.xmlcode.p  pThis was working fine in an older version of VLC, but in recent versions they added a password option and then made it mandatory.  There is no username.p  pI first tried using thisp  precoderequest.Credentials  new NetworkCredential, password request.PreAuthenticate  true codepre  pHowever this resulted in a WebException reporting a 401 error.  Snooping the traffic revealed that it sent one request that did not have the Authorization header, and then immediately reported the error without attempting to actually authenticate.  VLC did correctly respond with the WWWAuthenticate challenge.p  pIf I specify a nonblank username, then it sends the same request as before but then follows up with a second request that does specify the Authorization header  which then fails because VLC rejects the username.p  pI finally managed to get it to work by setting the header explicitlyp  precodevar credential  Convert.ToBase64StringEncoding.Default.GetBytes  password request.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.Authorization]  Basic   credential codepre  pThis seems like something that should have worked originally, though.

Since a nonstatic data member initializer would only be used by a constructor, GCC performs the instantiation as part of instantiating the classs constructor. clang and Intel do so earlier.p  pIm having trouble understanding what the standard says in [temp.inst]p1p  blockquote   pThe implicit instantiation of a class template specialization causes the implicit   instantiation of the declarations, but not of the definitions or default arguments, of the class member functions, member classes, scoped member enumerations, static data members and member templates and it causes the implicit instantiation of the definitions of unscoped member enumerations and member anonymous unions.p blockquote  pbecause I dont see where even the declarations of the nonstatic data members with or without initialisers get instantiated at all.p  pA bit more details about where I encountered this I was trying to create a template helper class that would never be created at runtime containing a member initialised using codestddeclvalltTgtcode which, I should add, I now realise wouldnt be of much use anyway, and libstdcs implementation of codestddeclvalcode contains a static assertion like the one in my example. I can work around the problem without much effort by avoiding codestddeclvalcode, but I would like to know what the standard requires.p

Negative 38136 pSo I am using the new codeimportcode module syntax introduced with the latest Xcode  I still wonder where the best place is to put them. Before, I would place library imports and very important categories in the code.pchcode file, but now thats not necessary anymore at least not for the native frameworks. My first idea was to create a codemodules.hcode file and do all the imports there, then include that codemodules.hcode file in the codeAppDelegatecode  but this doesnt seem right. Also, importing in the first place you need it doesnt make sense either, since you might use it in different places.p  pThis is in fact a question about best practices which is  of course  a little subjective. But I think this affects a lot of people and the overall project structure. So please share your solution to this.p

Negative 38136 pIm a RubyRails developer now working at a PythonDjango shop. Ive started to warm up to Python, however, Im still struggling to find Django comparable to Rails in certain aspects I find important. A lot of my current and future work will focus on making AJAX requests to our API. As a Rails developer, Id have used unobtrusive javascript and in particular on form submissions added a dataremote tag, as shown below.p  pId then write a method in the controller to handle the request and would have written a JavaScriptjQuery function using event delegation in a JS file located in the assetsjs directory to handle the response on the clientside. I assumed coming over to Django there would be a similar way of implementing this sort of functionality.p  pWhat I guess Im really trying to say is I assumed Django would offer similar magic to Rails in terms of not having to write out jQuery AJAX functions every time I wanted to make an AJAX request. I wrote a rough comparison very rough of how Id write both of these out. Im looking to learn if this is an incorrect approach to what I would do in Rails in Django. I know StackOverflow isnt meant for opinions, but I think breaking principles that apply no matter what languageframework youre using, i.e. DRYing up code by not writing out AJAX functions over and over, isnt really going against an opinion, its more like breaking an accepted rule.p  pMy current approach to working with AJAX requests in Django feels wrong, or maybe Im just used to the magic Rails offers via the dataremotetrue attribute. Would love some guidance on the topic to help me determine a solid approach, thanks. p  pemstrongRAILSemstrongp  pstrongviewssomecontrollerform.html.erbstrongp  precodeltform actionlt endpoint gt methodpost dataremotetrue idformgt   FORM FIELDS HERE ltformgt codepre  pstrongassetsjavascriptssomemodel.jsstrongp  precodebody.onajaxsuccess, form, functionevent, data    DO SOME STUFF HERE  codepre  pstrongcontrollerssomecontroller.rbstrongp  precodedef someajaxaction   if request.xhr     THIS IS AN AJAX REQUEST RENDER A VIEW PARTIAL amp      MANIPULATE THE DOM WITH JS OR RESPOND WITH JSON   else     THIS ISNT AN AJAX REQUEST   end end codepre  pemstrongDJANGOemstrongp  pstrongsomeapptemplatesform.htmlstrongp  precodeltform action url appview  methodpost idformgt    FORM FIELDS HERE OR  BUILDFORMFROMCONTEXT   ltformgt codepre  pstrongsomeappstaticassetsjssomeapp.jsstrongp  precodeform.onsubmit, functionevent    .ajax     type POST,     beforeSend function request        request.setRequestHeaderXCSRFToken, csrftoken     ,     data data,     url endpoint,     dataType json,     contentType applicationjson,     .donefunctiondata        cbnull, data     .failfunctiondata        cbdata     .alwaysfunctiondata        cbdata          codepre

Negative 38136 pthis may be a simply question but I hope its not.p  pI run some very long winded SQL operations on my local PC, which is hard wired to an ADSL modem for internet.  The SQL Server and databases are ALL local on my PC, and the processing seems fine.  as fast as normal.p  pHowever, if my internet drops out  which happens perhaps a few times a night at later hours usually, my SQL connection also drops with the familiar Connection lost error. An error one would get if connecting to SQL over a networkp  pFor me this does not make sense, my SQL connection string refers to the local instance only and no processing is over a network of any kind I have VPN sometimes active, but not always when this happensp  pI can run the same SQL processing without the modem connected with no issues at all. Although sometimes it can take many many hours so I prefer to have the modem connectedp  pCould this possibly be due to the extra SQL Services ie Browser  that is somehow affected by the modem losing its internet connectionp  pI would like to know that my ISPprovided modem is not doing any funny business in the background  like examining my data  traffic  etcp  pAny help appreciatedp

Negative 38136 pIve never quite gotten my head around nesting functions and passing arguments by reference. My strategy is typically to do something like codegetvariabletopassbyreferencecode inside the child function to accomplish this.p  pUntil now, I have been passing global variables to the function and this worked fine.

I also tried tinkering the codeposcode and codeinheritscode but to no avail.p  pI cannot find an exact answer on the net. If I could get this construct to work then thats my preference because I have a bunch of other functions that Ive coded up in similar fashion.

Negative 38136 pIve been trying to copy some codeassetscode to codeexternal storagecode in my Java code, and pass the directory to my native codeCCcode code to read from. However, the problem is, if there is codeno SD cardcode on the device the codegetExternalFilesDircode returns something like strongstorageemulated0Androiddatacom.example.appfilesstrong, which when I pass to the codenative codecode to fopen and fread, causes the app to crash. I believe the reason is because the directory is artificial or a symbolic link or something of the sort. However, even if I use the codestdlib.h function realpathcode on the path passed down to the native code, it still crashes. If however, I manually replace codeemulated0code with codeemulatedlegacycode in the path, coderealpathcode suddenly works and converts it to the actual location the files are stored, and the codefreadcode works fine with no crashes. Somehow codeemulatedlegacycode is the actual symbolic link and codeemulated0code is something elsep  pThe problem is I want to write code that is reliable in the long run, regardless of changes to the way Android organizes external storage and these symbolic linksvirtual filesystems. I also want the code to work regardless of which device it is run on I believe these emulated directories are different depending on the device.p  pIs there some way to get an codeexternal storage directorycode in Java that can be written to and reliably read from in native code as well, without doing this strongemreplacewithlegacyemstrong hackp  pThank you for any help you can give me.p  pEdit  Calling codegetPathcode, codegetCanonicalPathcode and codegetAbsolutePathcode on the codeFilecode returned by codegetExternalFilesDircode all return the same path.p

Negative 38136 pIm running Kali Linux v1.0.7, and am using hping3 to simulate a DoS SYN Flood attack. With hping3, you can spoof the source IP address to any IP of the users choice.p  pPrerequisite information on attack being simulated   Attacker IP 192.168.187.129   Victim IP 192.168.187.128   Spoofed IP 192.168.111.111p  pWhen executing the following commandp  precodehping3 p 80 S a 192.168.111.111 192.168.187.128 flood codepre  pHping3 successfully floods the victim host on port 80, sending tons of SYN packets, as desired. The victim responds with SYNACK packets  as expected. When capturing the packets being sent, Im noticing a problem where the attacking machine is responding to the SYNACK packet with an RST response.p  pI remember reading somewhere that this happens because the Linux kernel is not aware of the SYN packets hping3 is transmitting, and therefore follows the TCPIP protocol and responds with RST packets when receiving unsolicited SYNACK packets. As far as I remember though, this applies for packets which do not have a spoofed source IP. I cant remember the source, sorry. If anyone knows of a source that states this, please do let me know as it would be very beneficial to me.p  pMy question is, since the IP is spoofed, shouldnt SYNACK replies never reach the attacker Or are the replies being received because the virtual network is on a LAN, and therefore packets are routed according to the MAC address, and not the IP Also, the Hping Tutorial by RadarHack a hrefhttpwww.radarhack.comdirpapershping2v1.5.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.radarhack.comdirpapershping2v1.5.pdfa states To avoid sending a TCP reset packet from the attacking machine, use a spoofed IP address with the a switch.  which is what Im doing. Does this only apply when conducting this attack over the Internet, since packets have to be routed using the IP, and not the MAC addressp  pTo solve this issue, I set the following rule in the iptables of the attacking machine Kali Linuxp  precodeiptables A OUTPUT p tcp d 192.168.187.128 m tcp tcpflags RST RST j DROP codepre  pIm just asking this question out of curiosity, as well as to expand my knowledge in this subject.p  pThank you very much for your time to read my post p

Negative 38136 pgood afternoon guys and girls i am trying to learn cWPF for about 2 weeks now and im encountering some problems which google didnt help me to solve so far p  pLets say i have a random XML filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltXMLgt   ltADRESSEgt     ltNAME1gtJohnltNAME1gt     ltNAME2gtDoeltNAME2gt     ltSTRASSE1gtHeystreetltSTRASSE1gt     ltSTRASSE2gt9ltSTRASSE2gt     ltLANDgtAUTltLANDgt     ltPLZgt1050ltPLZgt     ltORTgtViennaltORTgt   ltADRESSEgt ltXMLgt codepre  pPretend this XML has like 100 entries.p  pNow ill have a simple Listview called lv1 in my XAML and a button.p  precode        int counter  0         GridView gv1  new GridView         XDocument rndfile  XDocument.LoadCUsers...random.xml          foreach XElement xele in rndfile.DescendantsADRESSE 1                       GridViewColumn gvc  new GridViewColumn             gvc.DisplayMemberBinding  new BindingFeldcounter              gvc.Header  xele.Name.LocalName  2             gv1.Columns.Addgvc              string feldx  string.FormatFeld0, counter             MessageBox.ShowfeldxFeldcounter was for me to test if names are identical             lv1.Items.Addnew  feldx  xele.ElementChildelement of ADRESSE.Value  34             counter                   lv1.View  gv1 codepre  p1 and 3 are my actual problems, whereby 1 and 2 are the same thing i guess.p  pSo basically what i want to do is press the Button, load the XML and create for each Child of ADRESSE a column with the name of the current Child and directly fill it with the XML content.p  pThe problems i am encountering now 1 the foreach loop only runs for each entry called ADRESSE instead of each child element of it and i just cant figure out how to get the childs of it without breaking any syntax tried it with Elements but he doesnt like that in the loop then.. So for now the XML above would only create ONE row instead of 7, because theres only one ADRESSE entry in the file.p  pFor the second problem i want to name the Columns with the Childname of the XML, but due to the problem at 1 it wont work as intended. or is this thought generally wrongp  pAnd the third problem is the dynamical filling of the columns. As far as i could see it codelv1.Items.Add...code does not accept the codefeldxcode from above, but thinks it is a own name and doesnt fill it correctly then, because there are no columnbindings named feldx. For 4 i need something like codefeldx  xele.Element0, ChildName.Valuecodefor the correct content of the column thenp  pI really tried to look and solve this on my own, but all stuff i found on XML or gridviews here or at mycsharpmsdn either was only with static hardcoded XAML entrys and bindings or just XML files where you know what entrys there are so again practically hardcoded. So i just hope my request just isnt too barefaced and someone could enlighten me a littlep  pEdit 1   p  precode    var rootele  rndfile.Root.ElementADRESSE.Elements lt worked like a charm. My problem was that i tried to fiddle this into the foreach loop itself, which wasnt accepted somehow  so many thanks har07     int counter  0     foreach XElement xele in rootele              GridViewColumn gvc  new GridViewColumn         gvc.DisplayMemberBinding  new BindingFeldcounter          gvc.Header  xele.Name.LocalName          gv1.Columns.Addgvc          lv1.Items.Addnew  feldx  xele.ElementChildelement of ADRESSE.Value   lt for this i am trying to find a solution and post it again, or maybe someone else knows how to add a changing Binding Name  into the .Add         counter           lv1.View  gv1 codepre
Negative 38136 pBefore I ask  this question I will provide some info on what I am actually trying to dop  pI need to refactor a large amount of GSP files in my grails project. After I tried writing my own groovy script for that  and realizing that it is way too much for my current skill level in any language  I found a hrefhttpwww.frommknecht.net201002robusthtmlparsingthegroovyway relnofollowthis articlea, which helped me a lot with parsing html content.p  pAfter a while I had put together my own script to parse an html file, serialize it again and save it to a new file. This is my scriptp  precodeimport groovy.xml.

But when I tried to test it with one codelist.gspcode, the serialization fails because of the unbound prefix codegcode for the element codegsetcodep  pcodeThe prefix g for element gset is not bound.codep  pNow, I kind of understand that what I am trying to do is not the regular purpose of XML parsing and serializing. But in my case, I do not only want the to disable the namespaces feature, but also want the parser to ignore all GSP tags and treat them as regular opening and closing tags in other words, ignore the double dots in any tag.p  pThe other thing I am concerned of is expression language, such as codelt page importltclassgt gtcode. Right now Im just getting the exception mentioned earlier, but this will probably need to be resolved as well.p  pAny help is highly apreciated.p

Currently, I am using codesudo pip install forcereinstall BASEFOLDERFORMODULEcode, but need to re run this command everytime I make any changes to the module code. p  pThe little bit of info Ive been able to find on the subject seems to indicate that while I can symlink the base folder for the module in the sitepackages folder for my other project, that this may not necessarily be a good way to do it. Is symlinking the folder bad, and if so why Is there an alternate better optionp  pThanksp

I can get there code working just fine, but when I try to edit their html to look like the html beloe, it stops working. The css still applies as one would expect, and the div outside of the ngrepeat works fine. However, Im pretty sure that the .addEvent in the mootools javascript cant find the .item within the ngrepeat, so I am unable to grab any of the .items in ngrepeat.p  pAny ideasp  pUPDATE  OK, it appears that the problem involves the domready event in the javascript. The angularjs hasnt loaded when that fires. I tried the load event, but this also fires before angularjs loads. Any other ideas for events Im using mousedown right now, but this means you have to click on one of the images before you can start dragging them, which is not optimal. In addition, the mousedown event seems to cause strange duplicates to appear in the cart sometimes, so Ill need to find a better method.p  precodeltdiv iditemsgt     ltdiv classitemgt         ltpgttestltpgt     ltdivgt   ltdiv ngrepeatpost in postsgt      ltdiv classitemgt         ltimg classpicImage srcstaticimgspost.picture altSmiley face height128 width128gt         ltpgtShirt 1ltpgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 38136 pIm moving my JavaScript test code from Jest to Mocha. One nice feature of Jest is that it automatically generated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17810004388951stubsa for your modules.

Negative 38136 pIve been experimenting with displayinlineblock as an alternative to displayfloat. All the documentation Ive found says properties that can be normally applied to a block element can be applied to an inlineblock element. Specifically height, width, margin and padding are always listed.p  pSetting height and width certainly works for me  and I assume everyone else as well, since every example Ive found on the web explaining inlineblock sets one or both.p  pBut setting margin or padding appears to have no effect at all in either IE9 or Firefox 32. And no example Ive managed to find sets either one.p  pId really rather use margins and padding, as the content can have varying width. Is there an example somewhere that Ive overlookedp  pThis is an excerpt of what Ive been playing with most recentlyp  precode.lnk2 a  display inlineblock margin 2px 1em padding 2px 2em   ltdiv classlnk2gt  lta hrefratesminneapolis55401.htmgt55401ltagt  lta hrefratesminneapolis55402.htmgt55402ltagt  lta hrefratesminneapolis55403.htmgt55403ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pIt doesnt matter what the values used for margin or padding are. The actual display never changes in either browser.p  pAlso, originally the div in the HTLM was ol and each a was wrapped in an li pair.

Negative 38136 pI want to implement a location based search of items. For performance reasons I would rather not have to process every single item against each other item. I thought the best approach would be to group items together in buckets based on proximity to some longitude and latitude and search only within those buckets. To accomplish this I need a list of coordinates that are evenly spaced apart perhaps in a way that three adjacent coordinates would form a triangle.p  pIm having trouble coming up with an algorithm that would allow me to plug in a distance between coordinates and have it spit out the list. Im not going for perfection, close is good enough. Also, I know Earth isnt a perfect sphere but its close enough for me not to care.p  pTwo questionsp  ol liIs this a good approach or is there a better way to implement location based searchli liWhats the algorithm Or help me out, my math sucksli ol

Negative 38136 pAt work we develop on top of a feature branch model where all integrations end up in the codemastercode branch eventually. We branch from codemastercode and strongmergestrong to codemastercode. This results in a very complex history graph and we are looking at ways to simplify our development workflow.p  pOne way of doing so it to strongrebasestrong instead of strongmergestrong. However, we have an internal GitLab instance installed where overwrite permissions are disabled and they are not going to be enabled for our project only. As such strongrebasestrong is out of the question.p  pI honestly dont see any way around this. But Im no Git expert and I might be missing something.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 38136 pI am using a Polar Equine Heart beat detector along with a microcontroller.  The Polar device will give a pulse for each heart beat.  But the output of that is not stable. If the electrode is not placed perfectly then the output will pulse unusually with high rate leading to high heart rate reading. The error pulsing is in the heart rate per minute range itself so its difficult to differentiate whether its actual or not. And also these error pulsing may get stable to correct reading after sometime.p  pBut it will take around 10s. But we cant wait till 10s all the time, since most cases we get correct reading from starting itself. p  pIs there a good algorithm to find out the heart rate per minute which can intelligently remove the error pulsing and something that locks to a common rhythm of pulsing rather than just blindly taking all pulsesp

Negative 38136 pAs I proceed in my possibly vain attempt to reimplement a curses style library that supports both nix and windows under an MIT license, Ive stumbled onto a problem reading terminal import using the windows api.p  pBasically, I dont get all the events I expect to, and I dont know why.p  pFirst I setup the terminal to be in nonbuffering modep  precodeDWORD mode HANDLE hstdin  GetStdHandle STDINPUTHANDLE    Save old mode GetConsoleModehstdin, ampmode   Set to no linebuffering, no echo, no specialkeyprocessing SetConsoleModehstdin, 0 codepre  pThen I use PeekConsoleInput and ReadConsoleInput in a loop to have a non blocking key press input the equivalent of using termios.h and select on stdin in linuxp  precodeEXPORT int stermreadvoid state    DWORD dwRead   INPUTRECORD inRecords[1]   PeekConsoleInputGetStdHandleSTDINPUTHANDLE, ampinRecords[0], 1, ampdwRead   if dwRead gt 0      ReadConsoleInputGetStdHandleSTDINPUTHANDLE, ampinRecords[0], 1, ampdwRead     if inRecords[0].EventType  KEYEVENT        if inRecords[0].Event.KeyEvent.bKeyDown          return inRecords[0].Event.KeyEvent.wVirtualKeyCode                 return 1  codepre  pIgnore the state variable thats so the api can accept an arbitrary state struct on various platforms.p  pNow if I try to use this codep  precodeinclude ltsterm.hgt include ltstdio.hgt define assertv, msg if v  printfFAILED s, msg return 1  int mainvoid    void state  sterminit   int i   char c   for       if c  stermreadstate  81   ie. press q to exit       break          if c  1        stermwritestate, ampc, 1  This is a thin wrapper around write1, ...           stermshutdownstate   return 0  codepre  pIt almost works. I get the input character I press pushed out to the terminal... mostly.p  pProbably every 10th character press is recorded. If I type quickly, the API loses events, and I get HEO WLD instead of HELLO WORLD.p  pWhats going on Does ReadConsoleInput somehow clear the input bufferp  pAm I doing something wrong It seems almost like Im only getting events based on a race condition which is is key pressed when PeekConsoleInput is called. p  p...but surely that shouldnt be the case The point of using these buffered IO interfaces instead of GetAsyncKeyState is that the events should be buffered rightp  pHelpp

I need to summarize the total time spent working on these transactions and a count of transactions within groups that break when you move from one group to another.

Negative 38136 pToday I struggled with an issue which I would like to share with you, and get your opinion on how to best solve this in my app.p  pstrongContextstrong  What I want is to have a layout with an ActionBar and Fragments. For the Fragments I use the default code by Android Studio using a ViewPager with SectionsPagerAdapter which fills with PlaceholderFragments. The different Fragments have one XML, and differ by some TextViews that I alter in the onViewCreated override of the PlaceholderFragments class based on the tab postition. Also, I want the Fragments to have a slightly different layout in landscape mode, so I added a fragmentactivity.xml to the reslayoutland directory. In this Activity I made a class, and in this class I have a method called updateControlButtonsp  precodepublic class SomeActivity extends ActionBarActivity implements ActionBar.TabListener ...   Override   protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activityhangboard       Set up the action bar.     final ActionBar actionBar  getSupportActionBar     Log.ionCreate, actionBar.toString     ...         private class SomeClass         public void updateControlButtons         ...            runOnUiThreadnew Runnable                  public void run                      ActionBar actionBar  getSupportActionBar                     actionBar.hide                     Log.iupdateControlButtons, actionBar.toString                     getWindow.clearFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON  KeepScreenOn off                     ...                                    ...             .....    codepre  pTo handle the orientation changes of the device, I have to reinitialize several TextViews to the current tab, and also to the current state of what was going on on the screen which is based on fields stored in SomeClass. For that I override the onViewCreated method as followsp  precode    Override     public void onViewCreatedView view, Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState          default code         super.onViewCreatedview, savedInstanceState this does not really do something          int position  getArguments.getIntARGSECTIONNUMBER          Log.iTEST onViewCreated position, Integer.toStringposition          switch position               no 0             case 1 BEGINNER                 someTextView.setText005                 break             ...

Then I could replace getSupportActionBar with that updated field. I would also have to do that for the Window, to have a correct call to p  precodegetWindow.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON codepre  pBy the way, using the setRetainInstancetrue call does not work for me, as I actually want to change the layout in landscape mode.p  pstrongQuestionstrong I do not like this way, it feels as if I should update way too much upon a simple orientation change of the device. Something that in my opinion should and is not even stored in the SomeClass Could this not be solved in an easier or more elegant wayp

Negative 38136 pIm attempting to view a PDF using QLPreviewController and Im struggling to change some of the view attributes such as Navigation Bar header and the background of the view.p  pI was able to change the translucency of the Navigation Bar after subclassing QLPreviewController and changing the codeself.navigationController.navigationBar.translucency  NOcode in the codedidViewAppearcode method, however I am unable to make changes to the codenavigationBar.titlecode or the codebackgroundColorcode attributes of the codeself.view.backgroundColorcode.p  pBoth the title and the background color will flicker when the view first loads but are immediately superseded by the PDF title string and the PDF itself which overlays the background color of the view.  The PDF pages appear over a black background.p  pI want to first know IF its possible to subclass or otherwise change that background color to my own custom color, then I would love to know if anyone has any suggestions or know a decent solution to changing that background color.p  pThe same goes for the title value to a lesser extent.p

The codePTRERRcode function would convert a pointer to codelongcode,but in  above code,codetestvaluegetcode would convert a codelongcode into codeintcode,and return it to codemytestcode .Since Im using a 64bit machine,the long would possibly  be cut off to lower 32bits,for example,if it is 0xfffffffe00000000, the return value would be cut to 0,and then codeiferrcode would not satisfy, which caused the codetestvaluecode be used in a wrong manner. Although the errno would not be greater than 4095,compiler seemed not be aware of it,the nearest overflow value would be 0xfffffffe00000000 Any commentsp
Negative 38136 pMy question is not quite a programming question, more along the line of how to use the software. Well, I have a file that contains all of my stored procedures for a webpage approximately 100 stored procedures.

I was wondering if there was any way to minimize all of the stored procedures all at once.p  pI know that in Visual Studio you can highlight all of the code the press CNTRLMM and it will minimize all of the functions.

The topmost view is dismissed using its modal transition   style, which may differ from the styles used by other view controllers   lower in the stack.p blockquote  pThis means when dismissing two modal view controllers at once usingp  pcode[[[self presentingViewController] presentingViewController] dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionnil]codep  pthe animation shown should be the top modal view being dismissed.p  pThis is indeed the case in iOS 7 and prior, but in iOS 8 the animation shown is not the topmost view in my experience, its the second topmost view. Is this behavior a bug in iOS 8 or am I doing something wrongp

A product is basically a picture with a few attributs.p  pIve implemented Jquery Dialog so that when User click on a button in the navbar , a form popup to create a new product wherever he is on the website. p  pThe way ive implemented it seemed pretty shaky to me so i would like some input on how to do it properly.p  pI have a product controller with a create route that create a new product based on attributs.p  pIn my application.html.erb where i have my navbar , i also have an hidden form that jquery use when clicked on the create a product button.p  pIt seemed weird to me to have a form at the end of my application view even tho nobody will ever see it there. p  pstrongWhere should i put it if not in my app view so that its accessible everywhere strongp  pIm also having similar problems with my controller. Im currently using formtag in my view to productspath and its working,but i might have to switch to formfor, and comes the problem of the post path form my form in the new form. product doesnt work , product either. It seems that it never hit the productcreate controller.And its obvious. p  pstrongShould i move my productcreate controller into application controller again seems pretty bad.strong p  pIf anyone can point me in the right direction. That would be greatly appreciated. p
Negative 38136 pOkay, so I am way new to Grunt and Node.js. I am building a site, and decided that the main.js file was getting way too big. So, I split it up, and I am now trying to use Grunt to piece all of these JS files back together.p  pThe issue that I have is that I need to make some global variables available to all of the various functions in all of these JS files. To be more specific, every page on our site is identified via an codeidcode in the body tagp  precodeltbody idhomegt codepre  pMany of these JS files contain if statements that ensure certain functions only run if the appropriate page is loaded. For examplep  precodeif page  home      var title  Home Page     .pagetitle.texttitle  codepre  pNotice the codepagecode variable That guy is the one that I need to make available to all of these files after gruntcontribuglify merges them together. So, I figured Id assign a new unique variable name, and make it global.p  pI noticed that a hrefhttpsgithub.comgruntjsgruntcontribuglify relnofollowgruntcontribuglifya has a a hrefhttpsgithub.comgruntjsgruntcontribuglifywrap relnofollowwrapa option listed in its documentation. However, no examples are given as to how to use it.p  pCan anyone tell me  How to use the wrap option in gruntcontribuglify  If this is the right grunt plugin for what I am trying to dop  pOne idea I had as a last resort is to create a codebefore.jscode and codeafter.jscode and put the beginning and end respectively of what I wish to wrap around the other files in each. But, I think the wrap option is what I need, yesp  pstrongemUPDATEemstrong Here is a link to my merged JS file a hrefhttpnwca.comjsmain.js relnofollowmain.jsap  pAnd a link to my Gruntfile a hrefhttpsgithub.comDerekFoulknwcanitrosellblobmasterGruntfile.js relnofollowGruntfile.jsap

Negative 38136 pThis was probably asked before a few times, but I have a few questions that could seem, well, noobish. I have to apologize in advance if any of the questions Im asking seem mediocre.p  pIm starting a random thought blog project, with a few friends. Im mainly the geek guy behind the project, though Im expected to contribute every now and then with a few posts.p  pIve finished designing the theme, its the typical blog style ish template and layout, can be easily integrated into any CMS.p  pThe part that I found myself stuck with is the platform. The last time I started a project was back when phpBB 3 was still new. My experience with WordPress back then was, well, less than good.p  pMy main thought was Were about articles, purely, if we use media itll be minimal. Code your own, Wordpress is bloated. I especially remember the caching issues with Wordpress, though Im unsure what was the exact problem back then, to be specific, Wordpress had slow loading speeds per page.p  pI started planning the platform, files structure, database structure, and so on, however, I found that the project, even though its supposed to be minimalist, its completely huge.p  pTo give an idea, this is the basic database structure that Ive come up with so far Excuse obvious mistakesp  blockquote   pUser    id    username    public name    email    password    birth date    gender    country    avatar    avatarUrl    registrationDate    displayContent    groupid    ip    sessionToken    sessionTime    lastLogin    loginAttempts    isTrashed    isBanned    isFlagged    isRestrictedp      pGroup    id    groupName    groupColor    groupIcon    avatarEnable    remoteAvatarEnable    isAdmin    addPost    editPost    trashPost    deletePost    editUser    trashUser    deleteUser    addGroup    editGroup    trashGroup    deleteGroup    addPage    editPage    deletePage    viewLogs    isTrashedp      pCategory    id    categoryName    categoryIcon    categoryColor    isRecommend    worthNotice    sfw    isTrashedp      pPost    id    title    content    authorName    authorId    date    sfw    category    like    dislike    isTrashed    lastEditedDatep      pComments    id    userid    email    website    username    content    ip    date    postIdp      pBanned    id    isGuest    userId    username    banDate    startDate    endDate    isPermanent    ip    ipBannedp      pWebsite    domain    offline    allowLogin    seoUrl    enableCaptcha    captchaKey    shareButtons    globalNotice    noticeType    displayNotice    notepad    displayAvatars    displayRemoteAvatars    defaultUserAvatar    defaultGroupIcon    defaultCategoryIcon    pageIcon    allowRemoteLogin    allowLocalComments    disqusKeyp      pPages    id    name    createdBy    lasteditedBy    date    pageIcon    lastUpdatedDate    displayInCategoryp      pLogs    id    entryBy    ip    eventType    eventName    eventIdp blockquote  pAs you can see, at the early structure, its a mess. Even if I go through the structure and end up with the perfect list for the project, this, while creating the list, really felt like a big blow of that is one big wheel youre reinventing there.p  pMy concerns  Wordpress is obviously a well established and maintained platform, however, how does it scale for say, caching and minimalist usage backend  Stability, Ive seen many users that still use the 3.9.4 version, last of its milestones in version 3, I think. My assumption was they basically figured Its stable by now, I wont have to worry about updates much.  I hate updating code every two weeks, I really do. Which is one of the major concerns, that if I use Wordpress, Ill be stuck updating it very often. Do they release minor milestones oftenp  pI know it sounds bad, worrying about something like updates, because its the one advice any geek would give Always stay up to date.p  pMy last concern, how does it scale in resources for shared hosting ie Number of queries performed per typical post page. Caching Database Cachingp  pThank you.p

Everywhere I look, I see people saying that its this amazing thingp  blockquote   pCTEs Common Table Expressions are one of the most beautiful and the most powerful feature of SQL Server and are boon to SQL Server developers. These not only simplifies most of the complex operations in TSQL but also do a lot more than one can imagine.p      pUser Comment from the Microsoft Technet article on using CTEs.p blockquote  pFrom what Ive seen myself and read online, a CTE is essentially just a selfpopulating temp table that can only be used once.  The only benefit I see is that the CTE cleans itself up, unlike the temp table which is bound to the session.

Negative 38136 pMy application uses Internet Explorer were required to support IE8 still to call certain wrappers that often create modal windows for users. p  pWeve come across an error due to the JavaScript statements stacking up while the user uses these wrappers.

If it   continues to run, your computer might become unresponsive.p blockquote  pIve found Microsofts solution a hrefhttpssupport.microsoft.comenuskb175500 relnofollowherea, but that wouldnt work for us. Modifying the registry isnt a good solution, because we want this safety net. p  pWhat seems to be happening is the JavaScript is hung up on the call to the COM wrappers and there are reoccurring autorefreshes every minute that fill up the stack. Im wondering if there is a way for the COM wrapper to be called without disabling these autorefreshes. p  pI imagine that calling the wrappers with a setTimeout would allow the browser to finish any processes before calling the wrapper, but that would still hang up the thread until the wrapper was finished.p  pAre there any ways I can have Internet Explorer call a wrapper without JavaScript Or maybe in another JavaScript thread Again, the ideal solution would allow the webpage to continue to autorefresh without being hung up from the call to the wrapper. p

I set up the realm in Glassfish, set up all the configurations in web.xml, set up my userpasswordgroup databases, and I can get it to authenticate, but it only works when I use plaintext passwords rather than a hash algorithm. This is obviously not desired, so I tried adding MD5 capability. Heres what I changedp  ul liI switched the realms hash algorithm from None to MD5li liI converted all the plaintext passwords in my SQL database to the MD5 hash of themselves. They are now stored as hashes rather than plaintext.li ul  pWhen I try to input the password, whether it be the original plaintext password or the exact hash, I still cant get it to authenticate. Is there something else I should have changed or considered Also, what does the hash algorithm option for the realm actually do It doesnt appear to convert the users input automatically, so Im wondering what its purpose is.

Any suggestions on how to solve the problem if there is a problem  I might have missed something obviousp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale1.0, userscalablenogt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtComplex iconslttitlegt     ltstylegt         html, body, mapcanvas                      height 800px             width 800px             margin 0px             padding 0px              ltstylegt     ltscript srchttpsmaps.googleapis.commapsapijsv3.expampsignedintruegtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt         function initialize              var mapOptions                   zoom 10,                 center new google.maps.LatLng33.9, 151.2                          var map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmapcanvas,                                           mapOptions              setMarkersmap, beaches                   var beaches  [           [Bondi Beach, 33.890542, 151.274856, 4],           [Coogee Beach, 33.923036, 151.259052, 5],           [Cronulla Beach, 34.028249, 151.157507, 3],           [Manly Beach, 33.80010128657071, 151.28747820854187, 2],           [Maroubra Beach, 33.950198, 151.259302, 1]         ]          function setMarkersmap, locations              var image                   url httpswww.google.comsupportenterprisestaticgeocdateartdotsbluedot.png,                 size new google.maps.Size21, 21,                 origin new google.maps.Point0, 0,                 anchor new google.maps.Point10, 10                             var shape                   coords [0,0, 0,21, 21,21, 21,0],                 type poly                          for var i  0 i lt locations.length i                  var beach  locations[i]                 var myLatLng  new google.maps.LatLngbeach[1], beach[2]                 var marker  new google.maps.Marker                     position myLatLng,                     map map,                     icon image,                     shape shape,                     title beach[0]                                                 google.maps.event.addDomListenerwindow, load, initialize      ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt      ltltpgt         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit fusce vel sapien elit in malesuada semper mi, id sollicitudin urna fermentum ut fusce varius nisl ac ipsum gravida vel pretium tellus.     ltpgt     ltpgt         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit fusce vel sapien elit in malesuada semper mi, id sollicitudin urna fermentum ut fusce varius nisl ac ipsum gravida vel pretium tellus.     ltpgt     ltpgt         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit fusce vel sapien elit in malesuada semper mi, id sollicitudin urna fermentum ut fusce varius nisl ac ipsum gravida vel pretium tellus.     ltpgtgt      ltdiv idmapcanvasgtltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 38136 pIm in the process of learning about Test Driven Development TDD so I can use it in a project Ive started, but Ive run into a question on how to set up a specific type of test Id like to do.p  pThe scenario is that I have a View that allows someone to edit information about a User such as username, first name, last name, etc. In many scenarios this User theyre editing will already exist in the database, so when they hit save the information gets updated in the database by that Views View Model.p  pWhat Id like to test is that the View Model is saving this information to the database. This is done using an Entity Framework DbContext I pass into the View Model during construction, which means that I need to create a DbContext in the unit test to pass into the View Model that can be updated and compared against. p  pThe Assert Id like to test would be something along the lines ofp  precodeAssert.AreEqualViewModelFake.EditedUser.Username, DataBaseContextFake.Users.Find1.Username codepre  pAfter the DbContext is originally created by the unit test it populates it with a User, and later in the unit test that User information is changed. The command thats being tested in the View Model is responsible for saving this edited information into the database, replacing what the DbContext was originally populated with.p  pIve been searching for a solution for the better part of these last two days but havent been able to track down examples of people doing the same thing. Is this something that should even be handled in a unit test Please note that Im not using a repositoryunit of work layer on top of Entity Framework.p

Negative 38136 pI have a WordPress site on my webserver and have recently copied it to my localhost testing environment using XAMPP bitnami to work on it, and proceeded to reupload the site back to the server without issue.p  pNow, everything is functioning fine except for uploading images. Whenever I attempt to upload them, it says it cannot write to the directory.p  pI have tried turning off datetime arrangement of images, Ive tried manually creating the folder its trying to use and temporarily setting the permissions of it to 777 and it works. However, when I change them back to 755 it stops allowing uploads again.p  pLike I said this has only happened since copying my localhost wordpress back. Ive read it may be due to the account WordPress is using to createwrite files.

Negative 38136 pThe code below works fine and as far as I understand every time the function is called, a local variable i.e. vector will be created and the ownership will be transferred in a rvalue reference at first call and in a const reference if I remove it wont even compile at second call. As a result, the local variables didnt actually die when the function terminated, but when the references in main went out of scope i.e. in the end of codemaincode, strongemI thinkemstrongp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt  stdvectorltintgt getvvoid      stdvectorltintgt v1,2,3     return v   int main      stdvectorltintgt ampamprvalref  getv      forunsigned int i  0 i lt rvalref.size i         stdcout ltlt rvalref[i] ltlt n      const stdvectorltintgt ampconref  getv      forunsigned int i  0 i lt conref.size i         stdcout ltlt conref[i] ltlt n      return 0  codepre  pOutputp  precodegsamaraspythagoras g stdc0x Wall px.cpp gsamaraspythagoras .a.out 1 2 3 1 2 3 codepre  pBut I thought local variables die when they got out of scope, except if a codestaticcode keyword precedes them, or they have been dynamically allocated, or even get copied.

Negative 38136 pI am using a SQLite backed ContentProvider to cache server data locally. I want to attach a timestamp to the entire ContentProvider so that I can very quickly check if data is uptodate by comparing the timestamp to that of the server. One easy solution is to have an update column. But that is a bad idea since I would be copying the data for each row whereas I only want the data once. Is there a way to save this data to disk without having to duplicate it every time I imaging a SharedPreferenceCursor combo can do it. But, instead, is there a way to save such data in the SQLite DB itself Or at least within the ContentProvider and be able to query it when I need it From what I understand the contentProvider has a set interface that must match ContentResolver. So how do I save a timestamp inside the content provider and be able to read it from my app without having to do it in every rowp  pCreatively I can create a table with one row for the timestamp only. But is that the best answer Or is there a more standard way of doing thisp  pI know it seems like I have the answer to my own question i.e. timestamp table of one row, but I dont want to hack it if there is a standard or better way of doing this sort of thing.p
