Positive 60836 pIm currently covering the basics of SQL databases and using them in play framework. I have created postgres database and successfully configured it in my application.confp  precodedb.default.driverorg.postgresql.Driver db.default.urljdbcpostgresqldatabase.example.complaydb db.default.userpostgres db.default.passwordqwerty codepre  pI have also created 1.sql file in confevolutionsevolutionsdefault directory and wrote there same example SQL code to create simple table. The problem is that play seems to ignore the existence of this file. When I run my server and connect to localhost, Im suppoused to be asked by Play, whether I would like to have my script applied to my database or not. Unfortunately Im not and the only thing play is doing, is loading my home page CREATE TABLE in 1.sql is not executed and I dont have any tables created. Any ideas what am I doing wrongp
Positive 60836 pI notice both codeviews.html.myView.render...code and codeviews.html.myView...code can be used to generate a page from the template. However, in case that we need to pass a implicit parameter list into the view, it seems only the codeapplycode version works while the coderendercode version does not compile.p  pI assume codeviews.html.myView.applycode probably delegates to codeviews.html.myView.rendercode or the other way around behind the scene, but Im not sure and cant find anything related to this in the documentation. The only thing I can get from the Twirl documentation is that codeTemplateNcode traits all define the coderendercode method, but none of them mention codeapplycode.p

Negative 60836 pI have a requirement on my current project a Flex app which will be run in Flash player to display an arbitrary subset of the components on a form while hiding all the other components based on certain aspects of the application state.  There are about a dozen different text boxes and drop downs, but some become irrelevant based on previously entered user data and we dont want to display those when we get to this particular form.  Every time this form is displayed I could need to show any one of the many permutations of these components.p  pIm trying to decide what the best way to approach this problem is.  Should I create a Canvas or other container with all of the needed controls on it and then just set visible  false on the ones I dont need  The problem then becomes making sure the layout looks decent.  I dont want there to be gaps where the hidden controls would have been.p  pThe other option Ive thought about is just having a mechanism that could dynamically instantiate the TextInput or CheckBox etc. component and then call container.addChildcontrol in order to build up the components and not have to worry about the gap issue.p  pThis seems like a problem that has an idiomatic solution in flex, but I dont know what it is.  Neither of these ideas seem great so Im wondering if anyone else has a better idea.p

Negative 60836 pI started out with a generic interface called ILogin.  The interfaces requires that you implement two properties UserID and Password.  I have many logintype classes that implement this interface.  As my project grew and grew, I found that many classes repeated the UserID and Password code.  Now I decide that I need a base Login class.  p  pIs it proper to create an abstract base Login class that implements the ILogin interface and have all of my concrete classes just inherit from the abstract class and override when necessary  Originally I was thinking there would be no problem with this.  Then I started think that ILogin was probably unneeded because itll likely only ever be implemented by my abstract class.p  pIs there a benefit to keeping both the abstract class and the interface aroundp  pThanksp

Negative 60836 pMerging projectsolution files is a wellknown disaster among developersSCM admins performing merges in their source control. p  pTake, for example, a common scenario development is done on a projectsolution in two different branches. When time comes to merge back into a main development line, there is a very small resemblance between the VCPROJs and SLNs. p  pThe reason is, Visual Studio may change and DOES change location of the various XMLlike elements within these files. E.g., Configurations Debug and Release may swap order upon every save operation on the proj file. This makes it impossible to easily incorporate changes from each development branch, not even considering an automatic merge.p  pI can assume that Microsoft are using some perl hashing system to hold the vcproj structures, hence the rendering of the files upon a save operation is not ordered.p  pId first like to ask did anyone found some elegant method to workaround thisp  pSecond, Id like to make two suggestionsp  ul lipHave Microsoft please reimplement the above files and restrict them to some rigid ordering of elements.pli lipfind a tool or write one that sorts vcproj xml format and sln sln format... files alphabetically, recursively all elements within elements etc.. Using this tool on both source and target files would enable to easily point and merge the changes, hoping that Visual Studio reads the sorted, merged project or sln file. pli ul  pAny other ideas and thoughts are welcome.p
Negative 60836 pQuick question.p  pThere is a legacy website that is not under my control and cannot be modified, that gives users a form to fill in data and then the user submits the form for processing.

So, Id have to recode every link again  to hack the language variable on the end.p  pstrongSecond thoughtstrong... ok, use jQuery to append the language variable to all anchors href.

In other words, by replacing the ConstructorInfo.Invoke call with a DynamicMethod that does the same, I am able to shave off 20 runtime when dealing with basic factoryscoped services ie. all resolution calls end up with a constructor call.p  pI think this is fairly substantial, and warrants a closer look at how much work it would be to build a stable DynamicMethod generator for constructors in this context.p  pSo, the dynamic method would take in an object array, and return the constructed object, and I already know the ConstructorInfo object in question.p  pTherefore, it looks like the dynamic method would be made up of the following ILp  precodel001    ldarg.0       the object array containing the arguments l002    ldc.i4.0      the index of the first argument l003    ldelem.ref    get the value of the first argument l004    castclass T   cast to the right type of argument only if not Object repeat l001l004 for all parameters, l004 only for nonObject types,  varying l002 constant from 0 and up for each index l005    newobj ci     call the constructor l006    ret codepre  pIs there anything else I need to considerp  pNote that Im aware that creating dynamic methods will probably not be available when running the application in reduced access mode sometimes the brain just wont give up those terms, but in that case I can easily detect that and just calling the original constructor as before, with the overhead and all.p

Negative 60836 pNow, seriously... Ill refrain from using bad words here because were talking about the Boost fellows. It MUST be my mistake to see things this way, but I cant understand why, so Ill ask it here maybe someone can enlighten me in this matter. Here it goesp  puBLAS has this nice class template called codeboundedvectorltgtcode thats used to create fixedsize vectors or so I thought.p  pFrom the Effective uBLAS wiki httpwww.crystalclearsoftware.comcgibinboostwikiwiki.plEffectiveUBLASp  blockquote   pThe default uBLAS vector and matrix types are of variable size. Many linear algebra problems involve vectors with fixed size. 2 and 3 elements are common in geometry Fixed size storage akin to C arrays can be implemented efficiently as it does not involve the overheads heap management associated with dynamic storage. uBLAS implements fixed sizes by changing the underling storage of a vectormatrix to a boundedarray from the default unboundedarray.p blockquote  pAlright, this codeboundedvectorltgtcode thing is used to free you from specifying the underlying storage of the vector to a codeboundedarrayltgtcode of the specified size. Here I ask you doesnt it look like this bounded vector thing has fixed size to you Well, it doesnt have.p  pAt first I felt betrayed by the wiki, but then I reconsidered the meaning of bounded and I think I can let it pass. But in case you, like me Im still uncertain, is still wondering if this makes sense, what I found out is that the codeboundedvectorltgtcode actually can be resized, it may only not be emgreaterem than the size specified as template parameter.p  ol liSo, first off, do you think theyve had a good reason not to make a real strongemfixedemstrongltlt size vector or matrix typeli liDo you think its okay to sell this emboundedem  as opposed to emfixedsizeem  vector to the users of my library as a fixedsize vector replacement, even named Vector3 or Vector2, like the Effective uBLAS wiki didli liDo you think I should somehow implement a vector with fixed size for this purpose If so, how Sorry, but Im really new to uBLAS just tried it todayli liI am developing a 3D game. Should uBLAS be used for the calculations involved in this hey, geometry, per Effective uBLAS wiki What replacement would you suggest, if notli ol  p editp  pAnd just in case, yes, Ive read this warningp  blockquote   pIt should be noted that this only changes the storage uBLAS uses for the vector3. uBLAS will still use all the same algorithm which assume a variable size to manipulate the vector3. In practice this seems to have no negative impact on speed. The above runs just as quickly as a hand crafted vector3 which does not use uBLAS. The only negative impact is that the vector3 always store a size member which in this case is redundant [or isnt it I mean......].p blockquote  pI see it uses the same algorithm, assuming a variable size, but if an operation were to actually change its size, shouldnt it be stopped assertionp  precodeublasboundedvectorltfloat,3gt v3 ublasboundedvectorltfloat,2gt v2 v3  v2 stdcout ltlt v3.size ltlt n  prints 2 codepre  pOh, come on, isnt this just plain betrayalp

If I open the document with the special characters and copy the document to Windows clipboard, then paste it into a UTF8 document and save it, it is okay.

Is this truep  pWhile certainly I could just output it as a character string into each packet, I would still have to convert to a wellknown format of each client, regardless of the platform.  The standard codeprintfcode and codeatodcode would be inadequate.p  pPlease note, because this game is a FreeOpen Source Software program that will run on GNULinux, BSD, and Microsoft Windows, I cannot use any proprietary solutions, nor any singleplatform solutions.p  pCheers,br  Patrickp
Negative 60836 pIm trying to take an existing bunch of code that was previously on a full .aspx page, and do the same stuff in a .ashx handler.p  pThe code created an HtmlTable object, added rows and cells to those rows, then added that html table the .aspxs controls collection, then added it to a div that was already on the page.p  pI am trying to keep the code in tact but instead of putting the control into a div, actually generate the html and Ill return that in a big chunk of text that can be called via AJAX clientside.p  pHtmlTable errors out when I try to use the InnerHtml property says it isnt supported, and when I try RenderControl, after making first a TextWriter and next an HtmlTextWriter object, I get the error that Page cannot be null.p  pHas anyone done this before  Any suggestionsp

Negative 60836 pFor some reason, I cant get this program to work. Ive had other CS majors look at it and they cant figure it out either.p  pThis program performs the Jacobi algorithm you can see stepbystep instructions and a MATLAB implementation a hrefhttpwww.prism.gatech.edugth683eCalc3ProjectprojectHome.html relnofollowherea. BTW, its different from the Wikipedia article of the same name.p  pSince codeNSArraycode is onedimensional, I added a method that makes it act like a twodimensional C array. After running the Jacobi algorithm many times, the diagonal entries in the codeNSArraycode codei[0][0]code, codei[1][1]code, etc. are supposed to get bigger and the others approach 0. For some reason though, they all increase exponentially. For instance, codei[2][4]code should equal code0.0000009code, not code9999999code, while codei[2][2]code should be big.p  pThanks,p  pChrisp  h2NSArrayMatrix.mh2  precodeimplementation NSArray Matrix  dynamic offValue, transposed   doubleoffValue      double sum  0.0     for  MatrixItem item in self          if  item.nonDiagonal              sum  pow item.value, 2.0      return sum    NSMutableArray transposed      NSMutableArray transpose  [[[NSMutableArray alloc] init] autorelease]     int i, j      for  i  0 i lt 5 i           for  j  0 j lt 5 j               [transpose addObject[self objectAtRowj andColumni]]                   return transpose    idobjectAtRowNSUIntegerrow andColumnNSUIntegercolumn      NSUInteger index  5  row  column     return [self objectAtIndexindex]    NSMutableArray multiplyWithMatrixNSArray array      NSMutableArray result  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]     int i  0, j  0, k  0     double value      for  i  0 i lt 5 i           for  j  0 j lt 5 j               value  0.0  JeremyPs answer             for  k  0 k lt 5 k                   MatrixItem firstItem  [self objectAtRowi andColumnk]                 MatrixItem secondItem  [array objectAtRowk andColumnj]                 value  firstItem.value  secondItem.value                          MatrixItem item  [[MatrixItem alloc] initWithValuevalue]             item.row  i             item.column  j             [result addObjectitem]                   return result  end codepre  h2JacobiAlgorithmAppDelegate.mh2  precode ...   voidjacobiAlgorithmWithEntryMatrixItem entry      MatrixItem b11  [matrix objectAtRowentry.row andColumnentry.row]     MatrixItem b22  [matrix objectAtRowentry.column andColumnentry.column]      double muPlus   b22.value  b11.value   2.0     muPlus  sqrt powb22.value  b11.value, 2.0  4.0  powentry.value, 2.0       Vector u1  [[[Vector alloc] initWithX1.0  entry.value andYb11.value  muPlus] autorelease]     [u1 normalize]     Vector u2  [[[Vector alloc] initWithXu1.y andYu1.x] autorelease]      NSMutableArray g  [[[NSMutableArray alloc] init] autorelease]     for  int i  0 i lt 24 i           MatrixItem item  [[[MatrixItem alloc] init] autorelease]         if  i  6entry.row              item.value  u1.x         else if  i  6entry.column              item.value  u2.y         else if  i   5entry.row  entry.column   i   5entry.column  entry.row               item.value  u1.y         else if  i  6  0              item.value  1.0         else             item.value  0.0          [g addObjectitem]           NSMutableArray firstResult  [[g.transposed multiplyWithMatrixmatrix] autorelease]      matrix  [firstResult multiplyWithMatrixg]    ... codepre

Checkoutadmin pages would have to be accessed via https though that I would ensure via .htaccess redirects. I would also like to have login form on every page of the site, including nonsecure pages. Now my questions arep  ol liif I have form on nonsecure page e.g a hrefhttpsubdomain.mydomain.comhomepage.php relnofollowhttpsubdomain.mydomain.comhomepage.phpa and that form sends data to stronghttpsstrongsubdomain.mydomain.comloginPage.php, is data being send encrypted as if it were sent from a hrefhttpssubdomain.mydomain.comhomepage.php relnofollowhttpssubdomain.mydomain.comhomepage.phpa I do realize users will not see padlock, but browser still should encrypt it, is it rightli ol  pEDIT my apologies.. above in bold I originally typed http but meant https, my badp  p2.If on secure page loginPage.php or any other accessed via https for that instance I created session, session ID would be assigned, and in case of my web app. something like username of the logged in user. Would I be able to access these session variable from a hrefhttpsubdomain.mydomain.comhomepage.php relnofollowhttpsubdomain.mydomain.comhomepage.phpa to for example display greeting message If session ID is stored in cookies then it would be trouble I assume, but could someone clarify how it should be done It seems important to have username and password send over SSL.p  p3.Related to above question I think.. would it actually make any sense to have login secured via SSL so usenramepassword would be transferred securely, and then session ID being transferred with no SSL I mean wouldnt it be the same really if someone caught username and password being transferred, or caught session ID Please let me know if I make sense here cause it feels like Im missing something important.p  pEDIT I came up with idea but again please let me know if that would work. Having above, so assuming that sharing session between http and https is as secure as login in user via plain http not https, I guess on all non secure pages, like homepage etc. I could check if user is already logged in, and if so from php redirect to https version of same page. So user fills in login form from homepage.php, over ssl details are send to backend so probably a hrefhttps...homepage.php relnofollowhttps...homepage.phpa. Trying to access a hrefhttp...someOtherPage.php relnofollowhttp...someOtherPage.phpa script would always check if session is created and if so redirect user to https version of this page so a hrefhttps...someOtherPage.php relnofollowhttps...someOtherPage.phpa. Would that workp  p4.To avoid browser popping message this page contains non secure items... my links to css, images and all assets, e.g. in case of a hrefhttpsubdomain.mydomain.comcheckoutPage1.php relnofollowhttpsubdomain.mydomain.comcheckoutPage1.phpa should be absolute so imagesimage1.jpg or relative so ..imagesimage1.jpg I guess one of those would have to work p  pwow thats long post, thanks for your patience if you got that far and any answers  oh yeh and I use phpapache on shared hosting p

Negative 60836 pIm working on a multiplaform project MacOS, Linux and Windows and Ive been having some performance issues when trying to compile a big source file in VS C 2010.p  pHeres a little background. Theres one .cpp file inside the project that is 800KB big. The size of the file is caused by the fact that Im compiling an array that contains image information. So, its a huge unsigned char array that cant be split.p  pNow, Ive been working on MacOS during the last couple of months, so I didnt notice this problem until some days ago. In both MacOS and Linux, gcc compiles the file in a second or so, but when I use VC it takes about an hour. p  pAt first I though it was cased by the computer itself, since its not a fast one. But then I tried Cygwin and GCC 4 in the same machine and the compilation time was almost as fast as in MacOS. So I have to assume the problem is caused by something within VC 2010.p  pI havent tweek VC in any form. The project files are generated by CMake, so I believe there should some room for optimizations here. Any help will be appreciated.p  pThanks.p  pHernanp

Negative 60836 pI am having a lot of trouble setting up an X509 certificate scheme in C.NET.  SSL is enabled on the server and the connection is being made over SSL.

Negative 60836 pIm looking to implement a setup package for my multiproject solution that installs a Windows Service as well as a Winforms application.  Both the service and the application have an ability to update themselves via a custom webbased utility that I wrote. So basically, the Windows service updates its own DLLs on a regular basis if it sees an upgrade on the web server.  Winforms application updates itself if it sees an upgrade on the webserver upon launch.  It does not use a standard Installer upgrade process but basically replaces .DLLs in place before they get consumed.p  pI understand how to make Windows to NOT repair my installation using NOT REINSTALL flag if I manually upgrade a few DLLs from the project.  However, if I enable certain files to not be repaired, I run into a problem with them not being uninstalled or upgraded when user manually upgrades or repairs his installation.  p  pSo, what I need is thisp  p1 Windows to not try to repair my manually upgraded .DLLs automatically wo explicit user request 2 Windows to UNINSTALL everything including the selfupgraded .DLLs  when user chooses to uninstall 3 Windows to Repair everything if user manually chooses to Repair installationp  pIs this possible  Is my only choice to implement custom actions that manually clean up .DLLs during uninstallp  pThank youp

Negative 60836 pIs there a way to enable spell checking in xcode maybe and addon that does spell checking only inside comments and not in code like vimemacs spell checker.p  pI have tried what is described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2697044xcodespellcheckingthis answera but it seems check the entire document since it complains about some variable names and macros which I obviously dont want to spell check.p
Negative 60836 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzqMDD.jpg altalt textp  pOkay so i have created the datagridview all right and enabled editing to the column as seen in the picture below. next i want to write a click event for the edit link such that when it is clicked, only the investigatorID column is available for editing. At that instance when changes can be made, i want the investigator column to display a dropdownlist of investigators that can be selected and that selected item be bound to the row on which the edit link was clicked.p  pI have the datasource to display the investigatorIDs am only wondering where to write the code for the click even of the edit link and have it do the magic.p  pLets work some Magic people..  Then i thought again and a better idea came up since i only need the investigator id to be passed into the database to be updated, i edited the design as followssee picture below so instead of having the exhibit type and image displayed in the grid view, i rather call up just the exhibit id to which the investigatorID will be assigned it makes more sense when you have a look at the database belowp  pthough not fully populated but the concept behind the database is that1. one case may be linked to more than one exhibit so to say one case has many exhibits and each of those exhibits is assigned an investigating officer that cannot be working on more than 3 exhibits at a time.p  pso at this stage when investigators are assigned to a case, the caseID,and  Exhibit details , are already populated. the Admin that opened the case would already have their ID there and the manager that is yet to assign the case would have their id and the investigators ID to be assigned to the fields.p  pLooking at my second design i have been able to create a grid to display only investigators that are working on a 2 or less exhibits. which means they are available to be assigned on at least one more exhibit. so to do the assigning, i select a CaseID from the dropdown list which details all cases from the case tablenot shown here and based on the selected case, i display all exhibitID linked to the selected casedID. from there, the user can select one Exhibit from the dropdownlist and and then select any of the available investigators to assign. so all i need to do now is when the user clicks the assign button, i want to know where and how i can make the investigatorsID against which the assign button was clicked be passed into the exhibits table as an update and that gridvire userID, Username aka investigators list be refereshed so that should the investigatorID that was recently clicked reached its threshold of three exhibits, their investigatorsID and name does not show up. and at the same time, the exhibit that has already been assigned also does not show up again in the dropdownlist. So in effect, the assign button is clicked, and the ID next to thatis sent to the exhibit table for update and the gridview together with the exhibit dropdownlist is refreshed.p  pthere shouldnt be a problem with the grid view since its datais directly binded so a simple exhibitgridview.databind should work it out and pobably calling the method that previously populated the exhibitdropdownlist would work the refresh for the dropdownlist as well...p  pso the problem here now is how to get the codes behind assign button click for this events to take place. please find attached below the code behind for the masterpages using a nested masterpage and the code behind and .cs file for the current page where this is supposed to happen.p  pFirst master page SITE.MASTER Code behindp  precode

Negative 60836 pIll try to be as clear as I can. I have already implemented my solution and it works, I just need to know if it would be best to use other data structure instead of a Hash tablep  pIts a college question, but I already submitted to the teacher and it works, I just wanted to see if anyone would have done it differently.p  pSo, this is the problemp  pGiven an image  PPM 3,all the data stored as ASCII in RGB  e.g. p  precodeP3  The P3 means colors are in ASCII, then 3 columns and 2 rows,  then 255 for max color, then RGB triplets 3 2 255 255   0   0     0 255   0     0   0 255 255 255   0   255 255 255     0   0   0 codepre  pI need to divide each pixel by a constant given wich will be power of two  2,4,864,128p  precodec 32 Pixel2255c,255c,255c  Pixel27,7,7 codepre  pThen, I need to convert all the pixels to patches of a given width,and the patch will accumulate the RGB values of the pixels it containsp  pe.g.  p  precodew3   imageW  10 imageH10 Patch[0].r  Pixel[0].r  Pixel[1].r  Pixel[2].r               Pixel[10].r  Pixel[11].r  Pixel[12].r               Pixel[20].r  Pixel[21].r  Pixel[22].r Patch[0].g  Same for g component Patch[0].b  Same for b component  Patch[1].r  Pixel[1].r  Pixel[2].r  Pixel[3].r               Pixel[11].r  Pixel[12].r  Pixel[13].r               Pixel[21].r  Pixel[22].r  Pixel[23].r etc codepre  pThen, I need to count the number of repetitions of each patch in the image. So, What Ive done its I have the Image class, which reads the image from a file ifstream, and a Pixel class, which has the r,g,b and nAparations components. I read the pixels, divide them by tha constant given, and get the patches acumulating the values of its containing pixels.p  pAfter this We have a data vector in my Image class wich its an array of Patches Objects e.g.p  precodedata  [Patch0r comp,g comp, b comp, 1 parition, Patch1r comp,g comp, b comp, 1 parition ..] codepre  pNow, What Ive done its using a hash table, insert each Patch, if its already inserted, just update its nAppearances component, if not, insert it. After all are inserted, return a vector with all the elements in the hash table. This vector, will only have one ocurrence of each Patch, and its nAppearances component will cointain tha number of times each Patch appears in the image.p  pIs there any other way Or a hash table is the best approachp  pAlso, what kind of hash function would you use Currently Im using p  precodehash  patch.r  1  patch.g 2  patch.b3 tableSize  maximun number of patches assuming no one repeats insert into table[hashtableSize] codepre  pThe Hash table allows collision, each position in the table has a list of elements.p  pSorry if its to large, just wanted to be clear. Also sorry if my English isnt good enough thanks.p
Negative 60836 pIm running a comparison program and at the minute it does a direct stringtostring comparison and if they are an exact match it outputs that they are a match.p  pWell, I was hoping to add an additional feature that allowed for similarity...p  pso for examplep  precodeString em1  52494646 String em2  52400646   if em1.equalsem2     output.writeUTFdir  filenames[i]  codepre  pThis is sort of a snippet of the code. Id like it so that it skips over the 00 and still recognises it as almost the same number and still outputs it.p  pId imagine it would look something like codeString em2  524  646code but thats obviously just a conceptp  pDoes anyone know if there is a way to have this kind of wildcard a term Ive picked up from uni SQL or if there is another way to do this similarity type deal.p  pThanks p
Negative 60836 pIm having problem with visual studio 2010 because it now makes my output directory full of .pdb and other files when building.p  pIn previous version of msvc I had intermediate directory set to something else than the output dir and had the .pdb files and everything else basically generated there IntDirProjectName.pdb say.p  pNow, in new version of msvc, it seems to still build the .pdb there but, for a reason I dont know, also put a .pdb file in my output dir which I dont want. Same thing seems to happen for .ilk files if I set incremental linking but that is less important as I can just disable incremental linking but .pdb is essential to debug the program.p  pI think this is a bug in msvc but I only found this on connect.microsoft.com a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails538348targetpathbug relnofollowhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails538348targetpathbuga which seems to be the same problem as me but the way he set the parameter this is not a bug. The way my config is done, it would be a bug but before filing one I would like to know if anyone had that issue and if they found a way to fix it ie is it really a bug.p  pBasically, just create a project with a different Intermediate directory and specify the pdb to be build there. Vs2010 seems to still create a .pdb in Output directory.p  pI guess for now I could add a postbuild event to copy the executable.p  pIs anyone had the same problemp  pHave you found a solutionp  pIs there a better way to get a clean output directory for now using msvs2010p

Negative 60836 pSo I have done a few minor things with web services and had some success, but when I attempted to tinker around with some stuff for fun I was encountering what I believe is me incorrectly parsing out the data to get the information that I need.  I can get the entire xml as a string but not just the 3 programs that I need.  The getPrograms and getInstitutions are similar enough that if I can get the programs part parsed right I can get the institutions.  Where I am getting confused is what I believe is the tags and how much they differ from any tutorials to what I am actually using.  I also went the way of the XmlPullParser but do not know if this is the best way about doing this is it. The format of what I am accessing is as followsp  precodeltDataSetgt ltxsschema idNewDataSetgt ltxselement nameNewDataSet msdataIsDataSettrue msdataUseCurrentLocaletruegt ltxscomplexTypegt ltxschoice

Negative 60836 pIm trying to understand the lowlevel mechanics of CAS on x86x64 and Id really appreciate some helpinsight.p  pThe reason Ive been thinking about this is that Im trying to reason about exponential backoff, and figure out in principle what the correct single unit of backoff delay should be.p  pIf I look at a lockfree freelist benchmark, without exponential backoff, I see as the number of threads increase, performance rapidly flatlines.p  precodeRelease 7 LockFree Freelist Benchmark 1     M    N    S   L3U L2U L2U L1D L1D L1I L1I  P   P L L L L total ops,mean opssec per thread,standard deviation,scalability 0 0 0 1 310134488,31013449,0,1.00 0 1 0 1 136313300,6815665,38365,0.22  0 1 0 1 136401284,6820064,50706,0.22 1 1 1 1 111134328,2778358,23851,0.09  0 0 1 1 334747444,16737372,2421,0.54 1 1 1 1 111105898,2777647,40399,0.09 codepre  pAs we know, livelock can occur, where each thread prevents the others from progressing.  p  pMy original  and I believe now mistaken  thought was that CAS was interfering with CAS.  By that I mean, the CAS instruction itself would destructively collide with another CAS, should they occur concurrently.  Both would fail.  Prolly because I was in the back of my mind thinking about ethernet.p  pThis obviously explains the results  all those CAS instructions operating concurrently, very few have a chance to fully execute before being destructively interrupted.p  pHaving thought about it some more, I believe now this cannot be the case.  The CAS instruction does not in fact HAVE a failure mode.  It will tell you the destination is equal or not equal to the comparand.  Thats all.  It doesnt come back and say oh, sorry, bumped into someone else.p  pDestructive interference IS occurring, but its occurring at a higher level, in the data structure algorithm itself.  When we push or pop fromto the freelist, we are actually TRYING to swap.  We need the destination to be stable for long enough that we can read it, do whatever work we need to do, and then find it unchanged so we can complete our pushpop.p  pIf other threads keep CASing, destination isnt stable  it keeps changing  and we keep having to retry our operation.p  pBut now Im confused.p  pWhat we see is that a single thread performs about 30 million pushpop operations.  Destination has to be stable for the duration of one of these operations, for the operation to succeed, so we see there are 30 million slots.  If we have two threads, then the maximum theoretical performance we can have is 15 million operations per thread each thread using half the slots.p  pNow lets come back to CAS.  CAS has no failure mode.  So whats happening when second thread tries to CAS when another thread is already CASing  well, the second thread will fail at the data structure level, since the swap couldnt occur, so it will retry the swap.p  pBut now imagine we have LOTS of threads.  The first thread to begin a CAS will succeed assuming each CAS takes exactly the same time  not true, but that assumption doesnt change anything fundamental, so its okay to reason with.  All the others will fail.p  pBut once the first thread has finished, the very next thread who reads the new destination value will have his CAS succeed and all the other threads, still executing their CASs or now beginning new CASs, will fail.p  pSo why do we not see perfect scaling  because every slot should be being usedp  pI think therefore I do not understand CAS properly.p  pReading Intels Architecture Software Developers Manual, I find that if all data is present in cache which the situation Im interested in, the cache coherency protocol takes care of CAS.p  pDrepper in his white paper describes LLSC and how it works using MESI.p  pIt seems reasonable to me for CAS to operate in a similar manner.p  pLets consider the two thread case.  First thread begins its CAS.  The cache line with the destination is in its cache and marked exclusive.p  pSecond thread begins to CAS.  The first core sends its cache line over to the second core and both cores have that cache line marked shared.p  pFirst thread completes the CAS and writes to the cache line the write always occurs on x86x64, even if the compare was false it just writes the original value.p  pThe act of writing marks the cache line as modified a RFO occurs, causing the second core to mark its cache line as invalid.p  pThe second thread comes to complete its CAS and notices its cache line is invalid... and then, what  I find it hard to believe the instruction is in the CPU internally looped until it succeeds  although I wonder, because LLSC on ARM requires emyouem in your assembly to do this loop.  But the CAS instruction knows that the value of destination has changed, so the results of its compare are invalid.  But theres no error possible with CAS it always returns true or false for the compare.  But even if the instructions do loop until complete, Id still expect perfect scaling.  Each slot should still be used.p  pSo what happens  what emisem happening with CASp  pWhat I do see is that as the thread count rises, less and less work is done  all available slots certainly are not being used.  Something is causing this.  Is it destructive interference between CAS instructions  or it is a large number of RFO hogging the CPUnorthbridge busp  pWhat I do note with considerable interest is that two threads on the same physical core scale perfectly.  Something special and different is happening in that case  two threads on separate physical cores scale half as well.  But its not enough of a clue to explain it all.p
Negative 60836 pI installed StyleCop and the associated plugin for ReSharper 5.  After getting annoyed with it I removed both the plugin and StyleCop, but ReSharper is still using some of the StyleCop behaviour  most notably moving codeusingcode statements to within the namespace declaration, rather than keeping them outside the declaration. p  pFor instance say you have the following sourcep  precodeusing System using System.Web  namespace Foo.Bar        codepre  pAnd the file sits within The codeFooBarWidgetcode directory, using ReSharpers fix namespace tool I would expect the file to stay the same, but the namespace to have changed to codeFoo.Bar.Widgetscode this is the behaviour it exhibited before StyleCop came along.p  pNow however it rearranges the filep  precodenamespace Foo.Bar.Widget      using System     using System.Web        codepre  pNow putting aside peoples personal preferences about which one is better, I dont like it, and it is inconsistent with our existing code.

It doesnt seem to like the 0 in front of anything, and must be stored in a string which has something before it in the case above, you have a  sign.p  pHow do I solve the problem with data loss  I did try looking it up in other places, but I didnt know what to put in for the query.p  pEDIT  More code.p  pThe number is originally stored in codeGET[content]code, passed to codenextFormcurrentcode.p  precodefunction nextFormcurrent       next  current[0] . current[1] . current[2] . current[3]  1     nextcat  current[0] . current[1]  1 . 0 . 1      iffileexistsplanpages0 . next . .php          return 0 . next      elseiffileexistsplanpages0 . nextcat . .php          return 0 . nextcat      else          return current       codepre  pHopefully that is more information needed.  It looks like a mess because I tried my hardest to keep those zeros, but they keep disappearing.p

Negative 60836 pIs there more detailed information available on the serial library  The reason Im asking is that the serial data Im receiving is getting chopped up into seemingly random sized chunks.  I know its fairly continuous, but perhaps small time delays are causing the receiving data event to be fired multiple times.  Im using asyncstreams.  Is a method to allow for time delays in the asyncstream before starting another stream  Or maybe its just a function of bluetooth that sends the data in packets  If I had to, I could probably use a timer rather than asyncstreams and pile the data up, but Id rather not if I dont have to.  The data Im receiving does look right, if it was all merged back into one stream.p

Negative 60836 pI am registering many custom .Net RTD server DLLs for Excel RealTime Data Feedbr Every time I change a single coma in the code I have to rebuild and redeploy register that darn dll.brbr The fact is, when I change the assembly name from emcodeASSEMBLYXXXcodeem to emcodeASSEMBLYYYYcodeem and register it using RegAsm, the former one is still registered if not explicitly unregistered and the new one is added on top. This sucks as Excel get mixed up between assemblies when the same classes are exposed via COM.brbr Moreover, Sometimes, even unregistering old assembly  reregistering new one with the same name after code change and rebuild I still get old assemblys output, not the new one. Weird. strongIssue 1strongbrbr So, I got it all mixed up and I would like to explore registry for all of the newly registered assemblies to clean up the mess strongIssue 2strong emMy gramma used to say  Nothing Good happens after 2AM.

Is there a good example somewhere of how to grab frames in a filter and send them to my app Or is there a way like, hook into some procedure call and get the frame from there somehowp  pIve seen hooking done for DirectX to get all the DirectX info, but, hardware overlays are not DirectX, are they Or can I just hook into DirectX and grab the front buffer from there or somethingp  pIve been searching for resources on this issue but I keep going around in circles and the fact that there are people who want to put the overlays on DirectX surfaces doesnt help, a lot of the results are on that topic.p  pIf its relevant, I would prefer a solution in C the app I have is in C and currently uses the regular way of grabbing screenshots from screen, which ofcourse leaves black rectangles for the hardware overlay.p

However, when it returns something I dont know whether it belongs to the last failed operation or its a remain from a previous error.p  pThe simplest solution would be to emresetem the codeodbcerrorcode and codeodbcerrormsgcode functions when theres an error so next calls would start from scratch, but I couldnt find a supported way to do so.

Negative 60836 pFor some gesture recognition software I want to build a recognition tree using the matlab function classregtree. p  pWhen I have a binary image of only the gesture, I create 2 intensity spectra one for the xaxis and one for the yaxis. From these spectra I want to extract some data, and use that to build the classregtree. Examples of the data I use are the width of the spectrum, the number of spikes, and the total area of the gesture. However, I also want to use data which has a variable number of parameters e.g. I want to use the heights of the individual spikes in the spectrum too as parameters for the classregtree. However, classregtree requires a fixed number of doubles for every dataset, while the number of spikes, and therefore the number of variables I want to pass, is variable. What is the best way to use this data I could just use a fixed number of parameters and pass a value of 0 if I cant create a value e.g. I always pass the values of 10 spikes, but when I have less than 10 their values will be 0, but Im afraid that it wont work well.p

Negative 60836 pIm working on a small project that has been allocated a small amount of time to maintain and update features.  This project is on Rails 2.3.p  pId like to move it to Rails 3.2 but there is little time allocated to this so I would like to do it over a slow gradual process.p  pIm thinking that it might be worth moving over to Rails 3.2 on a sectionbysection basis. This would mean that I would create a second application that looks the same as the first one but is located somewhere different and accessed from a different subdomain.p  pIs this feasible if I just update the Rails 2.3 routes file for certain routes to go to the new applicationp  pHas anyone done this beforep

Negative 60836 pI did a lot of researching on the matter but cannot seem to find the answer to my question, so I hope you guys can help me out.p  pWe have a struts 1.2.7 web app that we converted to a JSR168 portlet using the Apache Struts Portlet Bridge. p  pThis is all working very well except for one thing the actionforwards that specify a redirect do not actually redirect to the specified action. These redirects DO work when running the app as a normal struts web app. Hence, we have a double submit problem in the portlet variant. p  pWe make use of action chaining that ends with an action forwarding to a tile definition. For examplep  precodeltaction pathCreateIdmAccountSubmit  validatetrue   inputcatalog.createaccount.page typecom.konakart.actions.login.CreateIdmAccountSubmitAction nameCreateIdmAccountFormgt         ltforward nameFillRegistrationData pathFillRegistrationData.do redirecttruegt     ltactiongt  ltaction pathFillRegistrationData validatefalse typecom.konakart.actions.registration.FillRegistrationDataAction nameFillRegistrationDataFormgt         ltforward nameFillRegistrationDataPage pathFillRegistrationDataPage.do redirectfalsegt     ltactiongt  ltaction pathFillRegistrationDataPage forwardorder.registrationdata.pagegt tilesdef codepre  pIn this example the action emCreateIdmAccountSubmitem processes a submitted form POST and creates an account in the db. After successfull creation the user is redirected to another action emFillRegistrationDataem which inits an order object and, on its turn, forwards to the orderregistration page which layout is defined in the tilesdefs.xml.p  pAs I said this all works very well, form  a functional perspective, but when a user hits f5 on the rendered orderregistrationpage the action CreateIdmAccountSubmit is again invoked causing the account to be created double. As I said also this is not happening when running the app as a normal web app. Here, the mechanism works perfectly p  pI think that the problem is being caused by the fact that the redirect is done in the wrong phase but i am really not sure as why this does not work p  pBased on what I read I tried the fowllowing things to fix the redirect problem  specified the action that does the form submit as actionUrl in strutsportletconfig.xml hoping that redirect is done in wrong phase  replaced the normal html tag library by the strutsportlet variant hoping that a valid url actionUrl was produced by my htmlform that in some way made the redirect possiblep  pThese two steps did not seem to help and I am lost at how to accomplish a simple redirect in the portlet so that we can prevent the double submit problem.p  pHope you guys can help me outp

Negative 60836 pI have what is hopefully a very easy question, I just cant find the answer online. I made a merge sort function  which im sure has inefficiencies, but im here to ask about the threads. Im using Windows CreateThread function to spawn threads to sort intervals of a given array. Once all the threads are finished, I will merge the segments together for the final result. I havent implemented the final merge yet because im getting strange errors which im sure is from a dumb mistake in the threads. Ill post my code, if you could kindly look at paraMSort. Ill post the whole MergeSort.h file so you can see the helper functions as well. Sometimes the code will compile and run perfectly. Sometimes the console will abruptly close with no errorsexceptions. There shouldnt be mutex issues because im doing operations on different segments of the array Different memory locations altogether. Does anyone see something wrong Thanks so much.p  pPS. Are Windows CreateThreads kernel level In other words, if I make 2 threads on a dual core computer, may they run simultaneously on separate cores Im thinking yes, since on this computer I can do the same work in 12 the time with 2 threads with another test example.p  pPPS.

Here is where we have a dilemma  The system times on the Android devices arent all the same, nor can they be set to the same time with millisecond precision only manually with minute precision, which is awful.p  hr  pstrongSolution Attemptsstrongbr So, I first resorted to recording data according to a GPS time found at the start of the app.  Long process short  get GPS time, get System time, get difference, and upon recording a data point, get system time again and add the difference back onto the time, label that as starting time of recording, and increment by 200 milliseconds for each recorded data point from there.  However, there are 2 problems for getting GPS time  p  ul lipUsing codegetLastKnownLocationcode isnt too accurate.  Actually, it seems very inaccurate.  It is giving me times that are 9 minutes off the current GMTUTC time.  Coincidentally, however, system time is also nearly 9 minutes off on the Android device... the difference between GPS time and System time is usually between 1000 and 5000 milliseconds 1 to 5 seconds.  I suppose there is a chance my code is wrong.  I pasted it below for you to see.pli lipcoderequestSingleUpdatecode would be great to use, as it would get a more recent location and perhaps a very accurate time.  Problem  Requires API level 9... devices we dont have.pli ul  hr  pstrongIdeasstrongbr Heres an idea I had though  what if I somehow pulled a global time from a website and used the time pulled from there as the time of recording  Problem here  I have no idea how to do that, it is just wishful thinking of mine...  p  pAnother idea  is there some sort of global codegetTimecodetype of function that I simply dont know aboutp  hr  pstrongReasoning why I want Androids to pull time from a similar clockstrongbr Imagine two people sitting on a roller coaster  one in the front seat, one on the back.  When recording data, the person in front will obviously experience accelerations slightly before the person in the back will and we want to see this on our visualization graph.  That is why is it crucial, to millisecond precision, that these points are recorded according to a single, global time.p  hr  pstrongCodestrongp  precodeCriteria c  new Criteria c.setAccuracyCriteria.ACCURACYFINE  if mLocationManager.isProviderEnabledLocationManager.GPSPROVIDER      mLocationManager.requestLocationUpdatesmLocationManager.getBestProviderc, true, 0, 0, AmusementPark.this     Criteria criteria  new Criteria     String bestProvider  mLocationManager.getBestProvidercriteria, false     Location location  mLocationManager.getLastKnownLocationbestProvider      try           gpsTime  location.getTime         systemTime  System.currentTimeMillis         timeDif  gpsTime  systemTime         Log.etimedif, GPS   gpsTime  , System   systemTime , Dif   timeDif       catch NullPointerException e         codepre  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongbr a hrefhttpwww.coderanch.comt325004javajavaClockSynchronizationJavaHerea, someone suggests a sort of server codegetTimecode.

Negative 60836 pIve been spending some time looking into caching with redis and memcached mostly and am having a hard time figuring out where exactly to use caching when your data is constantly changing.p  pTake Twitter for example just read a hrefhttphighscalability.comscalingtwittermakingtwitter10000percentfasterMaking Twitter 10000 fastera. How would you or do they cache their data when a large percentage of their database records are constantly changingp  pSay Twitter has these models codeUsercode, codeTweetcode, codeFollowcode, codeFavoritecode.p  pSomeone may post a Tweet that gets retweeted once in a day, and another thats retweeted a thousand times in a day. For that 1000x retweet, since theres about code24  60  1440code minutes in day, that means the Tweet updated almost every minute say it got 440 favorites as well. Same with following someone, charlie sheen has even attracted a hrefhttpwww.forbes.comsitesmarkpasetsky20110302charliesheenattractsonemilliontwitterfollowersinoneday1 million Twitter followers in 1 daya. It doesnt seem worth it to cache in these cases, but maybe just because I havent reached that level yet.p  pSay also that the average Twitter follower either tweetsfollowsfavorites at least once a day. That means in the naive introrails schema case, the users table is updated at least once a day codetweetcountcode, etc.. This case makes sense for caching the user profile.p  pBut for the 1000x Tweets and 1M followers examples above, what are recommended practices when it comes to caching datap  pSpecifically assuming memcached or redis, and using a purely JSON API no pagefragment cachingp  ul liDo you cache individual Tweetsrecordsli liOr do you cache chunks of records via pagination e.g. redis lists of code20code eachli liOr do you cache both the records individually and in pages viewing a single tweet vs. a JSON feedli liOr do you cache lists of Tweets for each different scenario home timeline tweets, user tweets, user favorite tweets, etc Or all of the aboveli liOr are you breaking the data into most volatile newest to last few days to old chunks, where old data is cached with a longer expiration date or into discrete paginated lists or something And the newest records are just not cached at all. i.e. if the data is time dependent like Tweets, do you treat it differently if you older records know it wont change muchli ul  pWhat I dont understand is what the ratio of how much the data changes vs. if you should cache it and deal with the complexities expiring the cache. It seems like Twitter could be caching the different user tweet feeds, and the home tweets emper userem, but that then invalidating the cache every time one favoritestweetsretweets would mean updating all those cache items and possibly cached lists of records, which at some point seems like it would mean invalidating the cache is counter productive.p  pWhat are the recommended strategies for caching data that is changing a lot like thisp

Negative 60836 pIm working on a little game that is uses soundpool to play small soundfiles. However, it now seems that I have too many sound files that I want to add to the soundpool since I get an error saying that the heap has an overflow. So then I tried to load the sound files when they are needed instead of loading them when the class instance is initialized, but the result of that turned out very bad.p  pAre there any other ways I can make it work using soundpool or do I have to use media player instead I already have media player class that is used to play long sound clips like music files and so on. So the backup plan is to make two instances of the media player class that runs on two separate threads where one of them handles the small sound files. Any help and ideas is highly appreciated.p  pGreetingsp

Negative 60836 pIm not even sure of the right terminology, so let me start with my objective to have a simple app Data Doler that does nothing but read a huge hunk of data from a file into memory, and then serve up slices of that data to a single multithreaded app called Data Lapper, or to multiple instances of Data Lapper.p  pData Doler only needs to start up and read the data hunk once, and so I want it to stick around at least until Armageddon.  Data Doler should just sit there idling, waiting for Data Lappers to connect and start requesting data. Data Doler will always run on a multicore machine with  50 gigabytes of memory. p  pThe data is static and read only, and it is indexed such that all Data Lapper needs to do is give Data Doler a memory address and it instantly gets back the exact slice of data requested.p  pData Doler can be written in any language C, C, AtariBasic, etc.p  pI have the C source code for Data Lapper, so how I connect to Data Doler is entirely open.p  pIve started to educate myself about SqLite, shared memory apps, named pipes, ipc, etc.  But Im hoping someone can save me some time by telling me which tree I should be barking up, or whether Im so clueless about this stuff Id be better off staying on the porch.p

Negative 60836 pI have successfully pulled back a list of enterprise users using the Box API a hrefhttpdevelopers.box.comdocs relnofollowhttpdevelopers.box.comdocsap  pI now want to batch update a group of users, setting the group to Inactive.p  pIn the API, I see that you can update a single user like this codePUT usersidcodep  pI believe I can just loop through a list of users from a .csv file and individually set each of them to inactive via the method above. The problem is that I dont know the ID of each user to include in the .csv file. If I export the users via the Box Admin Consoles Bulk Edit feature, I get a .csv file of the users, but it only contains the following columns Name, Email, Groups, and Storage.p  pSo, my first thought is that there may be some way to update the user through the API using the email address. As in, first search for the user via the email address, then get the ID from the results, and finally use the returned ID to update the user account. Is this possible or can you suggest another way to solve this problemp

Negative 60836 pIm needing to just simply write to a file and read from a file in Windows Phone 8 using the Windows.Storage APIs. This is relatively easy using the old IsolatedStorage method, but its proving significantly harder using the new WinRT API. p  pIve been trying to write it, but there seem to be all these weird things like IBuffer. and such. Using the full version of WinRT, its quite easy using Windows.Storage.FileIO which appears to exist to keep developers like me from going insane. However, its not implemented in the Phone version. Also, I watched a a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comSeriesBuildingAppsforWindowsPhone8JumpStartBuildingAppsforWindowsPhone8JumpStart04FilesandStorageonWindowsPhone8 relnofollowChannel9a video which showed some code samples, but they had a mistake in that they used methods marked Security Critical to get regular streams.

Negative 60836 pIn linqtoentities queries, how spaces be prepended to shorterlength values when querying against an nvarchar columnp  pI seek this capability to facilitate proper sorting of certain fields.p  pstrongHere is my scenariostrong p  pI have database that contains empart numberem columns in virtually every table.  These part number columns are represented as nvarchar20 in the database.  They usually contain a combination of both 6digit and 8digit part numbers.  The vast majority of these part numbers are in fact numeric but some are nonnumeric. Consequently they are represented as strings rather than integers.p  pBecause these part numbers are represented as strings rather than numbers, they do no sort properly.  The 6digit and 8digit values are intermingled rather than separately grouped.  So I want to pad the shorter length values with leading spaces to solve the sorting problem.p  pI do realize that if these columns were stored as emncharem rather than emnvarcharem, I would get this padding automatically.  But changing the data type for these columns is not an option at this point.p  pWhen I craft my own linq queries, I can do sorting properlyp  precodedb.table.Select gt .partNumberColumn.OrderBy gt .Length.ThenBy gt  codepre  pThe problem arises when other tools such as grid automatically compose queries.

Negative 60836 pPlease read the question first as the heading isnt very clear and I am not able to put my question in few words.p  pstrongMy scenario is as suchstrong I am creating a P2P application. A peer, during installation, generates Public and Private key pair and uploads the public key to my central server. When a peer A wants to communicate with peer B, it downloads the public key of B and normal encryption and data transfer takes place.p  pI need a little heads up for creating this publicprivate key pair programmatically. Again I need this public key of a peer to be signed by the central servers private key so as to know its authenticity.p  pDo I have to create a private CA sort of thing or any other way is possible  If someone can help me understand this creating, signing, etc from programming perspective, that would be great. I am getting a lot of concept out there in google search but not much in coding. I am new to cryptography so any other idea to implement the same would be helpful.p  pNote I cannot use any third party CA. And I am not using the certificates for authentication, but for encryption. p  pThanks.p

Negative 60836 pemPreface Im attemping to use the repository pattern in a MVC architecture with relational databases.emp  pIve recently started learning TDD in PHP, and Im realizing that my database is coupled much too closely with the rest of my application. Ive read about repositories, and using an a hrefhttplaravel.comdocs4.2iocIoC containera to inject it into my controllers. Very cool stuff. But now have some practical questions about repository design. Consider the follow example.p  precodeltphp  class DbUserRepository implements UserRepositoryInterface      protected db      public function constructdb              thisgtdb  db           public function findAll                public function findByIdid                public function findByNamename                public function createuser                public function removeuser                public function updateuser            codepre  h2Issue 1 Too many fieldsh2  pAll of these find methods use a select all fields codeSELECT code approach. However, in my apps Im always trying to limit the number of fields I get, as this often adds overhead and slows things down. For those using this pattern, how do you deal with thisp  h2Issue 2 Too many methodsh2  pWhile this class looks nice right now, I know that in a real world app I need a lot more methods. For examplep  ul lifindAllByNameAndStatusli lifindAllInCountryli lifindAllWithEmailAddressSetli lifindAllByAgeAndGenderli lifindAllByAgeAndGenderOrderByAgeli liEtc.li ul  pAs you can see, there could be very, very long list of possible methods. And then if you add in the field selection issue above, the problem worsens. In the past Id normally just put all this logic right in my controllerp  precodeltphp  class MyController      public function users              users  Userselectname, email, statusgtbyCountryCanadagtorderBynamegtrows          return Viewmakeusers, arrayusers gt users        codepre  pWith my repository approach, I dont want to end up with thisp  precodeltphp  class MyController      public function users              users  thisgtrepogtgetfirstnamelastnameemailusernamestatusbycountryorderbynameCanada          return Viewmakeusers, arrayusers gt users        codepre  h2Issue 3 Impossible to match an interfaceh2  pI see the benefit in using interfaces for repositories, so I can swap out my implementation for testing purposes or other. My understanding of interfaces is that they define a contract that an implementation must follow. This is great until you start adding additional methods to your repositories like codefindAllInCountrycode. Now I need to update my interface to also have this method, otherwise other implementations may not have it, and that could break my application. By this feels insane...a case of the tail wagging the dog.p  h3Specification Patternh3  pThis leads me to believe that repository should only have a fixed number of methods like codesavecode, coderemovecode, codefindcode, codefindAllcode, etc. But then how do I run specific lookups Ive heard of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSpecificationpatternSpecification Patterna, but it seems to me that this only reduces an entire set of records via codeIsSatisfiedBycode, which clearly has major performance issues if youre pulling from a database.p  h2Helph2  pClearly I need to rethink things a little when working with repositories. Can anyone enlighten on how this is best handledp

Negative 60836 pI have a webservice that uses immutable classes in action parameters thats because of other devs working on the project  which means no public setters. No public setters means that webservice wont see properties.p  pThe idea was to create private setters and add an codeinitcode method annotated with codePostConstructcode to my webservice class. Inside the codeinitcode method all private setters would be set accessible through reflections.p  pThe problem is that the codeinitcode method annotated with codePostConstructcode isnt called at all while deploying. Im using JAXWS and deploying the project to Glassfish.p

Negative 60836 pIm writing a grammar for parsing a computer language, that can be used with a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgcasianoParseEyapp1.182libParseEyapp.pod relnofollowParseEyappa. This is a Perl package that simplifies writing parsers for regular languages. It is similar to yacc and other LALR parser generators, but has some useful extensions, like defining tokens in terms of regular expressions.p  pThe language I want to parse uses keywords to denote sections and describe control flow. It also supports identifiers that serve as placeholders for data. An identifier can never have the same name as a keyword.p  pNow, here comes the tricky part I need to separate keywords from identifiers, but they may look similar, so I need a regular expression pattern that matches an identifier caseinsensitively, and nothing else.p  pThe solution I came up with is the followingp  ol liEach keyword is identified by a token of the following form codeikeywordwcode ul licodeicode will apply caseinsensitive matching for the following subpatternli licodewcode will not accept any word characters az, 09, etc. after the keywordli lithose characters will not be part of the matchli ulli liKeywords that are the same as the beginning of another keyword are listed after the longer keyword, so they match firstli liThe token for matching identifiers comes last so it will only match when no keyword is recognizedli ol  pThe token definitions and part of the grammar I came up with work well so far, but there is still a lot to do. However, that is not my question.p  pstrongWhat I wanted to ask isstrong, am I on the right track here are there better, simpler regular expressions for matching those keywords Should I stop and use a different approach for language parsing altogetherp  pThe idea of using the tokenizer to match whole strings instead of single characters came from the ParseEyapp documentation, by the way. I started with a characterbycharacter grammar first, but that approach wasnt very elegant and seems to contradict the flexible nature of the parser generator. It was very cumbersome to write, too.p

Negative 60836 pI have a html section element which has a Knockout foreach binding to a collection of items on my viewmodel. This works fine rendering each item of the collection onto a div vertically down the page. I now want the items to group themselves in rows based on window size, so items appear in say, rows of 4 on a desktop browser but only 1 per row on mobile.p  pI did actually achieve this by creating the groups in the viewmodel and having my view element bind with a foreach to this groups property. The problem with this approach is that my viewmodel now has what I would consider a bunch of view logic in it and references the window object directly. Which is not right I dont think.p  pI already have a separate js file which has view specific logic in it, namely custom Knockout bindings for things like slideVisible. How can I move the grouping logic out of my viewmodel and into this file Im guessing I wont be able to use Knockouts foreach binding if the grouping isnt done in the viewmodelp

Negative 60836 pIve been using CodeIgniter for some time, but mostly for the convenience features such as internationalization, and cookie and session control.

I have learned about the core things such as database access, which is the one of the core reasons why people use a php framework, but I just havent been building sites that requires it for now.p  pOne of the things that I couldnt find an answer on is about relative path. In my a tags, Ive always put the complete path. For examplep  precodelta hrefltphp echo  .pageController .  . pageMethod .  . pageLanguage . home gtgtHomeltagt codepre  pHowever, Ive discovered that if I just putp  precodelta hrefhomegtHomeltagt codepre  pit would actually work as long as Im using the same controller, method and language. I even tried in the French section of my and it works too. Obviously, to switch language, Id have to give the full path. I dont think this has anything to do with CI, but a browser behavior.p  pWhat is this behavior exactly When a browser sees a relative path, does it look at the current path, goes to the nearest  character, erase everything after it and add the relative path Can I count on this every timep

Negative 60836 pI have a single scala project built with sbt using a build.scala file. I can use sbtassembly to generate a single executable jar file from this project without problem. Now I want to generate multiple executable jar files, where each file includes a common set of internal and external base dependencies along with emdifferent external dependenciesem.p  pIs this possible with the current version of sbtassembly In maven this is easy, as one can define multiple profiles in the pom, each generating a separate jar, but in sbtassembly you pass the assembly settings to your project and I havent figured out a way to modify the settings to generate multiple jar files.p

Negative 60836 pI am using Ruby to generate a 64 bit timestamp similar to Java.

I thought I could usep  precodeTime.now.tof  1000 codepre  pbut I am worried about losing precision due to the floating point conversion. Can I simply get the 64 bit timestamp millis since epoch as in Java in ruby, as precise as possiblep  precodeCalendar.getInstance.getTimeInMillis codepre  pI need to use the timestamp as unique ID in a database, so I would like to keep timerelated collisions from minimum to nonexistent.p
Negative 60836 pI have a FuelPHP application that Im trying to setup to extend an existing website well call it codeexample.comcode. The FuelPHP installation is in a directory called codelistingscode within the codeDocumentRootcode. However, the main codeindex.phpcode file for the application is located in a subdirectory of codelistingscode called codepubliccode, so the actual path to the codeindex.phpcode file is codeltDocumentRootgtlistingspublicindex.phpcode. The static assets JavaScript, CSS and images for the application are in subdirectories of the codepubliccode directory as well.p  pI want people to be able to access the application at codepropertiescode. Also, there will be requests made for other pages such as codepropertiesadmincode as well as requests for static assets such as codepropertiesassetscssstyle.csscode.p  pIve got this thing about 90 working. The code.htaccesscode file in the codeDocumentRootcode looks like thisp  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteRule properties. listingspublicindex.php1 [L] codepre  pInside the codepubliccode directory, there is another code.htaccesscode file that looks like thisp  precodeOptions FollowSymLinks Indexes RewriteEngine on   Send request via index.php not if its a real file or folder RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d     RewriteRule . index.php1 [L] codepre  pI set the codebaseurlcode in the FuelPHP config to codehttpexample.compropertiescode. All of the URLs for the static assets are appearing the way I would expect them to, for example, the path to my codebootstrap.csscode file appears as codehttpexample.compropertiesassetscssbootstrap.csscode. This is what I expect. However, instead of Apache grabbing the static asset, its running the request though the FuelPHP codeindex.phpcode file, resulting in a 404.p  pI think I need to add a codeRewriteCondcode to the code.htaccesscode file that is in the codeDocumentRootcode, but Im not exactly sure if thats correct, or what that codeRewriteCondcode would look like.p  pHow do I adjust my code.htaccesscode files so that Im able to access static assets such as codehttpindyapm.compropertiesassetscssbootstrap.csscode which is actually located at codeltDocumentRootgtlistingspublicassetscssbootstrap.csscodep

Negative 60836 pSo let me first explain what I am trying to emulate. From the home page, there is a main table with recent table entries. The user is given a set of favorite folders where they can drag and drop table rows from the main table. Rather than dragging the whole visible row my rows are rather wide, and it is difficult to tell which folder it will drop into I have the information icon, which in this case is an up arrow. The user can drag the icon and drop it into a folder, when at this point it should be removed from the main table and appended to the table within that favorite folder. So far, most of this is happening in the following fiddle except the row is not removed from the main table. The problem starts to become apparent with the use of Datatables. After adding the row to the favorite folder, it is clearly there, until you click next and previous on pagination. It disappears. Also, it never seems truly a part of the table because the information on the bottom left of Datatables is not updating. Showing 1 to 2 of 3 entries, when there may be 4 total from the rows the user dragged. I understand to add rows to Datatables, you need  fnAddData but Im not sure how to use it in this instance, any ideas Thank in advance.

So, the expected behaviour is that change event hadler of the second input field is fired, strongBUT NOT, its not fired.strong  So now cursor is inside third input field, i enter there value and click on the fourth field. As result the change event hadler of the third field is fired.p  pConclusion. This behaviour i reproduced only in IE9 IE10. Didnt tested in IE8. In Chrome change handler of each input field is fired.

E.g. my actual bundle identifiers arep  ul liUXXXXXX.au.com.blah.MOCK li liUXXXXXX.au.com.blah.DEVli liUXXXXXX.au.com.blah.TEST li liUXXXXXX.au.com.blah.PRODli ul  pTherefore my bundle identifier in my info plist has been configured as UXXXXXX.au.com.blah.BUNDLESUFFIXp  pNow to allow me to build the app differently for each build, I did the followingp  ul liI have 4 different bundle identifiers with 4 different provisioning profiles assigned to those bundle identifiersli liTo begin with i added a new configuration called MOCK I will add the others in laterli liThen under the project build settings I added a BUNDLESUFFIX user defined variable to my project and set it to MOCK for the MOCK configuration I will add the others in later. This is used to set the bundle identifier for a build that uses the MOCK configuration.li liThen under the project build settings, selected my MOCK provisioning profile for the MOCK configuration in build settingsli liI notice if i go to the summary view on my app target it displays the bundle id as UXXXXXX.au.com.blah.MOCK with the MOCK part being in grey font  so it has picked up the bundle suffix variableli liThen i created a new scheme called MOCK to use MOCK configuration for Profile and Archive. I left defaults for the rest uses DEBUG.li ul  pSo now I can run an xcodebuild and use scheme MOCK to do a MOCK specific build that will use the MOCK configuration to set the bundle identifier to .MOCK and set my provisoning profile to use MOCK profile.p  pSo i then run a jenkins build which does an xcodebuild and xcrun which will call codesign.p  pThis is my xcodebuild commandp  precodeusrbinxcodebuild scheme MOCK sdk iphoneos project MyApp.xcodeproj configuration MOCK clean build CONFIGURATIONBUILDDIRUsersCIDocumentsworkspacebuild3 ONLYACTIVEARCHNO DEPLOYENVIRONMENTMOCK CODESIGNIDENTITYiPhone Distribution My Company PROVISIONINGPROFILEXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX codepre  pThis is my xcrun commandp  precodeusrbinxcrun sdk iphoneos PackageApplication v UsersSharedJenkinsHomejobsMyApp.app o UsersSharedJenkinsHomejobsMyAppworkspacebuildMyApp0.9.5.0.ipa embed UsersSharedJenkinsHomeLibraryMobileDeviceProvisioning Profiles20130816DistributionMOCK.mobileprovision sign iPhone Distribution My Company codepre  pNOTE I specifically sign the app with the MOCK provisioning profile, as I worked out that I cannot sign the app with a . profile, as the app uses push notifications and if I build the app with a . and then resign the app with the proper profile, my embedded.mobileprovision profile gets updated, but the actual executable within the .app file never gets updated. And this causes push notifications to never get to the device. So what i need to get working is the ability to build and sign an app from command line with the app having a bundle id that is populated dynamically using a variable. And I cannot seem to get this working.p  h3THE RESULTSh3  pThe xcodebuild runs successfully and works perfectly. The app appears to be built and signed properly as .MOCK and using the MOCK provisioning profilep  pBUT The generating of the IPA file has an issue, I have an issue with the codesign.p  pNotice, that I built the app without any code signing entitlements. codesign gives me this error warning Application failed codesign verification.

I know another way to get around this issue is to sign the app initially with a . provisioning profile and then resign the app after with the proper profile, however this does not work for me. As the executable file within .app still keeps references to the . provisioning profile. And thus push notifications can never be picked up by this device.

Negative 60836 pI have two text boxes on my .aspx page, say TextBox1 and TextBox2. Each of them have codeRangeValidatorscode attached to them, so that the user is restricted to entering only a certain range of integers. Moreover, the value in TextBox2 cannot exceed the value in TextBox1. For this, Im using a codeCompareValidatorcode on TextBox2. The codeControlToComparecode property is set to TextBox1, the codeTypecode property is set to Integer and codeOperatorcode property is set to codeLessThanEqualcode.p  pWhen I enter valid integer data say 100 in TextBox1 and noninteger data in TextBox2 say 90.5, the RangeValidator correctly fires to inform me that the data in TextBox2 is not valid.

Negative 60836 pIm a little bit unsure about how to design a complex Spring MVC application in the best way.  The problem is related to a usermanagement system. My UserVO implements the UserDetails interface of Spring. p  pBut for request and response only a special part of information is needed.  In the request it should be allowed to send the password in order to change it. But flags like enabled, expired, locked should obviously not be changable by the user. On the other side this information should be displayed to the user, so must be included in the Response. The password is never send to the client. p  pI started with using the JsonIgnore and JsonAttribute Annotations on setter and getter. But as the flags are boolean they are persisted with the default value false every time I update.p  pstrongPossible solutionstrong Writing a DTO for response as well as for the request and using the ObjectMapper of Spring to persist them. Is this the right approach I would feel more comfortable if I could just work with my VOs and set some magic annotations if you know what I mean p

So I tryp  precodegtgtgt import mymodule gtgtgt dirmymodule [BooleanField, CharField, DateTimeField, DecimalField, MyClass, MySecondClass, ForeignKeyField, HStoreField, IntegerField, JSONField, TextField, builtins, doc, file, name, package, datetime, db, division, os, struct, uuid] codepre  pThe only two classes which I defined in mymodule are codeMyClasscode and codeMySecondClasscode, the other stuff are all things that I imported into codemymodulecode. p  pI now want to somehow be able to get a list of all classes which are defined in codemymodulecode without getting all the other stuff. Is there a way to do this in Pythonp
Negative 60836 pAt work i have to implement an EDI thing. I have to create an XML message, sign it with a certificate, encode it with codeBase64code, pack it in an XML structure and send it to a server. To send the message to the soap service i use a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk7b147comsunxmlinternalmessagingsaajclientp2pHttpSOAPConnection.java relnofollowHTTPSOAPConnectiona. The problem i ran into is, that i always get a code503 service unavailablecode error.br I thought okay the service is not started, but for curiosity i tryed to reach it with codeSoapUicode. Sending the same message to the same service endpoint i get a codeHTTP 200 Okcode, with a response message.br Analyzing this response i have found, that there is a codeBase64code encoed xml inside, like the service documentation said. Decoding this i found out, that the server sent me an error code, saying that the service is unavailable.br But how can it be, that with my java generated request i get a 503 and with SoapUi i get a service specific response, containing the service specific error code for 503 The only thing i can think about is, that something is wrong with my request. But what other reasons can a Http 503 have How can i analyze the error for example comparing the codeMimeHeadercode of SoapUi with mine... One more information i can give you is the block in which the error occures Starting at line 245 of a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk7b147comsunxmlinternalmessagingsaajclientp2pHttpSOAPConnection.java relnofollowHTTPSOAPConnectiona p  precoderesponseCode  httpConnection.getResponseCode  let HTTPINTERNALERROR 500 through because it is used for SOAP faults if responseCode  HttpURLConnection.HTTPINTERNALERROR      isFailure  true  else if responseCode  HttpURLConnection.HTTPOK else if responseCode gt HttpURLConnection.HTTPOK ampamp responseCode lt 207 else if responseCode  100  2      log.logLevel.SEVERE,     SAAJ0008.p2p.bad.response,     new String[] httpConnection.getResponseMessage     throw new SOAPExceptionImpl         Bad response           responseCode          httpConnection.getResponseMessage       codepre  pI am getting this Bad response, with a 503 response code and no response message.

Negative 60836 pBasically, Id like to subclass codeClipData.Itemcode so that I can send data other than codeCharSequencecode, codeIntentcode or codeURIcode along with a codeDragEventcode. The docs seem to suggest this is possible see the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentClipData.Item.htmltoString relnofollowdocumentationa alongside the codetoStringcode method, which specifically mentions subclasses of codeItemcode, however everything Ive tried hasnt worked despite neither codeClipDatacode nor codeItemcode being declared codefinalcode.p  pThe basic setup

Negative 60836 pI have a simple custom table in AX, for which i need to create a Web service so that data could be populated by an external system. I created a Document service with all the Axd and Ax objects involved. Next i wrote a simple console application to try populating some dummy data. Interesting thing is i can only get string data type columns populated. Int, Real, Date, Enums etc are not coming through. p  pIn the code below, i am only getting StoreItemId and Barcode columns, as both are strings. Cost is real, ErrorType is Enum, DocketDate is date and none of them get any values. I have discussed this issue with many colleagues and none is aware whats happening. Does anyone know or could point me in some new direction Thanks a lot. p  pPS  I have limited experience with AIF and if i am missing something fundamental, please excuse and do let me know.

Negative 60836 pIve been looking around for options to automatically update my page with new data from the server. My data can change from every 10 minutes to possibly 1 hour, no way to predict this. Whenever this happens, the change must appear pretty quickly on the screen no longer than 15 seconds.p  pSo one option is just polling and sending a request every 15 seconds, but then sending requests to the server and getting empty results for over 30 minutes does sound a bit stupid.p  pBut if I use longpolling, is it acceptable to keep a connection open for such long periods What if theres no new data for nearly an hour Also if I go with longpolling, Ill need to set some timeout, wouldnt I But then it wont make sense to end the connection knowing that there might be new data on the server, and then reinitiating the connection. Thatll be regular polling with longer intervals, wouldnt itp  pWould appreciate if somebody could guide me to the best solution for my problem. Thanks in advancep

Negative 60836 pIm new to Android, but not to programming, and I have to create a prototype app for a Masters project. I have 2 predetermined arrays, each containing 33 values. The aim is to get the arrays displaying each value on a button click. Eventually itll do more, but thats not important for now.p  pIve used a simple ifelse if statement, and enclosed it in a tryfinally block. The arrays loop beautifully, but when the value of i reaches the end of the array 32 and increments past it 33, it doesnt bypass the first if argument and go to the else if block. Try and try as I might, I cannot for the life of me figure out why its not returning a false and skipping to the next section on the subsequent iteration. The logcat shows its exceeded the array length, which is fine, but I have an argument in place to catch that.

Negative 60836 pWhat is the strongbest way to serve public static files uploaded at runtimestrong by users using Spring Boot and embedded tomcatp  pMoreover, is there an elegant way to upload and serve static file trees directlyp  pWe are building a CMS that enables internal users like designers or frontend developers to directly upload their work on our server. It often consists in several files linked together by a relative path, so it could be really easier to have something to handle file trees directly. Files are always static as dynamic features only run on clientside.brIt could be helpful to purpose implementation ideas if there is no standard solution available like using a zip then recreating its internal organisation into tomcat public folder.p

The left and right side have a known width in rems, but its completely fluid otherwise. The codetextoverflowcode works nicely in Chrome, IE11 and Chrome for Android, but not on the latest Firefox. Im looking for something that would make it work there too, without breaking any of the other browsers. I also cant use workarounds like hiding the main text with a backgroundcolor on the side elements due to the containing element having semitransparent background color, and Id like to keep it that way.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodehtml    boxsizing borderbox  , before, after    boxsizing inherit   .head    width 100   whitespace nowrap   overflow hidden   textoverflow ellipsis   position relative  .left, .right     width 5rem   padding 0 0.1rem   position relative   zindex 1  .left    float left  .right    float right  span    position relative   zindex 0 codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classheadgt   ltdiv classleftgtFOO BARltdivgt   ltdiv classrightgtFOO BARltdivgt   ltspangt     long text     ltspan stylecolor redgtthatltspangt     should end up     ltbgtwrapping withltbgt     text overflow ellipsis blah blah more blogging here   ltspangt ltdivgtcodepre div div p

Negative 60836 pCan you combine ASP.NET skin file and DevExpress theme assemblyp  pI am currently testing DevExpress components for web development. My goal is to use skin files to change some properties across multiple components in a web application. For example, I want to set PageSize property for ASPxGridView. What I ultimately want to achieve is to have some predefined theme ie. Metropolis and then change some minor attributes in skin file. As far as I could gather there are two ways apply a themep  ol liApply a theme with ASP.NET mechanism. To do that you should create a folder structure with necessary filesli ol  blockquote precodeAppThemes     Metropolis        Controls.Skin        Metropolis.css         images  codepre blockquote  pThe downside is that this is not recommended devxpress approach and I have to maintain all the theme files. And all I want to change is a single setting in skin filep  precodelt Register TagPrefixdx NamespaceDevExpress.Data assemblyDevExpress.Data.v14.1, Version14.1.4.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb88d1754d700e49a gt lt Register TagPrefixdx NamespaceDevExpress.Web.ASPxGridView AssemblyDevExpress.Web.v14.1, Version14.1.4.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb88d1754d700e49a gt ltdxASPxGridView runatserver gt     ltSettingsPager PageSize20gt     ltSettingsPagergt ltdxASPxGridViewgt codepre  ol start2 liAppy a theme wih DevExpress Mechanism  Create a new theme assembly and deploy it to web app. On uses the following setting in web.config    li ol  blockquote precodeltdevExpressgt     ltthemes enableThemesAssemblytrue styleSheetTheme themeMetropolis gt ltdevExpressgt codepre blockquote  pThe down side is that to change a single setting pageSize one has to go through a whole procedure to create a custom assembly. This takes time and unnecessary work. Even to open a theme in devexpress ASPxThemeBuilder tool takes ages. To put it short stupid. Other downside is that applied changes are lost in the whole mass. One does not have an overview what was changed and what not. Also very bad.p  pI was wondering if there is a third way which is hinted in devexpess documentation. But their docs are a lot of words and very little said. Namely my idea si to use built in theme assembly and then combine it with a simple skin file where I would define only properties that I need to modify. Yet, devexpress docs do not provide more information on that topic. Is this possible and howp

So, the edit method in my controller creates a viewmodel.p  precodepublic class ViewModel      public ListltCustomergt AvailableCustomers get set      public Company Company get set  codepre  pThe view creates a form with a drop down list from which to select a customer using Knockout.p  precodeltselect databindattr name Company.Customer.Id, options AvailableCustomers, optionsText Name, optionsValue Id, value Company.Customer.Idgtltselectgt codepre  pWhen the form is posted back to the server, I have the Company model with the new Customer Id selected by the user.  Now I want to update the database using Entity Framework.p  pI get the Company being updated out of the database using the id for the Company that was posted back in the form data, which is just my viewmodel from earlier.  Now I want to update the Company with a new Customer.  The only information I have at this point is the Id of the Company that the user selected from the drop down list.  So I do something like thisp  precodevar companyBeingUpdated  repository.GetByKeyltCompanygtCompany.Id companyBeingUpdated.Customer.Id  Company.Customer.Id codepre  pAs soon as I call update on my repository, I get an exception that says The property Id is part of the objects key information and cannot be modified.

I could easily do this with a SQL statement, but I want to understand what I am doing wrong with EF.p  pHow do I go about updating the Customer related entity of the Company object with EF when the only information I have is the Customer Id posted back in the form datap  pI know I could probably retrieve the Customer entity from the database using the Id and assign the Company.Customer to that retrieved Customer, but this is actually a very simplified example.  In reality, I have quite a bit more than just one related entity and if I have to make a trip to the database to look up each related entity in order to do the update, I can see performance quickly becoming a problem.p

I would like to set the Change column to y or n depending on whether or not the staff or lineManagers are below a given staffID in the the chain of command.p  pFor example... from the point of view of staffid  8 the table would look likep  precodeid  lineManagerID    staffID    changeable 16  9                8          y 19  8                7          y 20  8                6          y 21  6                5          y 24  NULL             9          n codepre  pSo the column is marked y if staffid  8 or the staffid is a lineManager in the chain of command for a staffid below it... does that make sense It should be marked as n if the staffid doesnt have authority over those higher in the chain. Since 9 is 8s manager then 8 has no authority to change 9s line manager. I hope that is clear enough.p  pHope you guys can help.p  pThanks. DSp
Negative 60836 pAlright so Ive been stuck on this one for 2 days going on 3 and I still cant figure out a way. I need to use this to tell if explorer is running if not start it, the reason I need to do this is to make a program to prevent people from leaking files... Got the rest of the code sorted out just stuck on this one. The only way I can think of which isnt efficient is to add all the processes into a listbox and search for explorer and if its not there then start explorer. Huge thanks for the help p

Negative 60836 pIm writing an encryption program to encrypt files large and small to do this, my current method is to read 1024 bytes from a file, encrypt those bytes, and write them to a temporary file, and repeat until finish. Once this process finishes, the original file is deleted and the temporary file is renamed to take the name of the original.p  pHere is a sample piece of code that processes n bytes n being 1024p  precode        private void processChunkBinaryReader Input, BinaryWriter Output, int n               Read n bytes from the input fileStream         Byte[] Data  Input.ReadBytesn          Read n bytes from the streamCipher         Byte[] cipherData  StreamCipher.OutputBytesn         for int x  0 x lt n x              XOR a byte of the input stream with a corresponding byte of the streamCipher             Data[x]  cipherData[x]          Write n bytes to the output fileStream         Output.WriteData      codepre  pSo Im pretty sure I cant multithread the encryption algorithm because the bytes are generated as a keystream and depend on the bytes generated before, but reading and writing from files and cpu operations can bep  pWhats the best strategy to take herep

Negative 60836 pIm trying to use  the MFP function in R similarly to how I use the equivalent command in Stata.

E.g. in Stata I use the commandp  precodemfp regress variable1 variable2 codepre  pThere seems to be a function codemfpcode in the library codemfpcode in R which I would like to use. p  pe.g. in Rp  precodesummarymfpvariable1  fpvariable2 codepre  pThis gives me the results of an regression but R forces it somehow into a GLM model.

Negative 60836 pIm working on porting some code to an environment with more strict alignment requirements than x86 has, but Im changingtesting on an x86 Linux machine for the time being due to this being easier for hardware access reasons, among other things.p  pIve distilled the first problem that Ive run into into the following   concise examplep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  define BUFFERSIZE 1024 define DMQUOTELOG DMQUOTELOG  void aFunction const char configPath      char LogFilename[BUFFERSIZE] attribute aligned       printf An     strcpy LogFilename, configPath     strcat LogFilename, DMQUOTELOG      printf Log sn, LogFilename   int main int argc, char argv      asmpushfn               orl 0x40000, espn               popf        aFunction       return 0  codepre  pRunning this code as is provides the expected output. However, uncommenting the other printf causes a bus error to trigger on the strcat line.p  pIt looks to me as if the reason for this is that by introducing a second string constant, the constant from the define is shifted so that its not aligned. This is upheld by noticing that if the string constant is changed from An to AAAn, everything works again and magically gcc replaces the call to printf with a call to puts and drops the n from the constant.p  pIs there some nice way to make gcc insert extra padding between all of the string constants that its inserting into the .rodata section so that things align properly p  p[EDIT]  p  pAs mentioned by fucanchik below, heres what the .rodata section of the above is with the extra printf enabledp  precode    .file   sample.c     .section    .rodata .LC0     .string A .LC1     .string DMQUOTELOG .LC2     .string Log sn     .text .globl aFunction ... codepre  pThere is no alignment forced, which makes sense because Im compiling under x86, which doesnt strictly require it.

This may of course be moot if glibc itself cant handle being run in this mode in the general case, though.p  precode    .file   sample.c     .section    .rodata .LC0     .string A     .align 4,0 .LC1     .string DMQUOTELOG .LC2     .string Log sn     .text .globl aFunction ... codepre

Negative 60836 pThis is a difficult issue but Im not sure where to turn. To sum it up from the start, Im having trouble with arrays in c. To head off your inevitable response, I have to use arrays, I cant use vectors. The reason being that I will eventually be interfacing this with CUDA which cant accept vectors.p  pAnyway, I have written my own class to handle 2D arrays and all the stuff that goes with that behind the scenes. The header file is reproduced at the bottom of this question. I use this class to define a 6 x 10 array. I then loop over many items, primarily using the add method of my class. At some point in this complicated loop, the size of my array switches from 6 x 10 to 0 x 1074266112. I have tried to debug my code and figure out what the issue is but for the life of me I cannot find the issue.p  pIve printed out all the values at the moment the array size changes, and none of them are out of the norm and Im never trying to index the array outside of the 6x10 size. In fact, it never even happens at the same point of the loop, it just seems to happen randomly for each run. The only constant I can find between each issue is that the new array size is always exactly 0 x 1074266112.p  pSorry I cant provide a minimum working example, but this issue only crops up in my large program and I cant reproduce it in a smaller program. I was at least hoping anyone could see if Im doing anything wrong with my Matrix program below and possibly suggest a method of debugging.p  pstrongEDITstrong If I change this to use a vector rather than an array, the issue goes away. I.e., if I change the relevant parts to codevectorltdoublegt datacode and upon instantiating, codedata  vectorltdoublegtx  ycode, the issue mentioned above is no longer a problem.

Negative 60836 pI have a game right now based on a server client communication. My problem is that with my codes right now, when a player sends a message to the server and the server updates the universeworld, it creates a bundle and sends that whole universeworld to the players. Due to the massive amount of data that the server must update, make a bundle, then send it to the players it creates a lag or slows down the game if more that a couple players decides to join in. From reading things online, I know that the player and the server must have almost the same copy of the universe and that what the server needs to only send out to the other players is what is being changed in the world and the players own worlduniverse would update the game. I also know that what must be changed are my protocols. This is what I have so far for my protocols for both server and client.p  pPlayerp  precode Marshalling and unmarshalling   shot gt message define marshshot s   list newshot posnx s posny s   string

Negative 60836 pIm trying to figure out how to properly do drag and drop, and from what I read on MDN, it sounds like i should be able to indicate via dragenter that a drop is possible on that element.

I dont really want to register a dragover event handler tho, because I dont need that to be called every time the mouse moves inside an area.

Third time when i again click on Preview again it goes as a POST again and blank page again gets loaded as a pdf. Not sure what triggering this kind of behaviour. Its happening with IE11 only, works ok with Chrome. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 60836 pWhat I am trying to achieve is protect a customerdeveloped video gamewith Unity3D executable with a license, that expires after a certain period of time. The thing is, my team has no longer any access to the game executable, so recompilation of the game executable is out of the question. That is why I decided to embed the game executable as a resource into a program wrapper, that first checks if the client license is valid through online verification  I used System.Net and System.Net.Http to achieve that. After the license server returns an OK response to my desktop game wrapper, I would like to start the game executable in memory, without writing it to the disk. p  pHere is the sample code for loading my executable from a resource, but it gives me badimageformatexception during runtimep  precodeStream stream  GetType.Assembly.GetManifestResourceStreamLicenseServerClient.testBinary.exe byte[] bytes  new byte[intstream.Length] stream.Readbytes, 0, bytes.Length  Assembly assembly  Assembly.LoadbytesAssembly.Loadbytes The debbuger stops here, throwing a badimageformatexception   assembly.EntryPoint.Invokenull, new object[0] codepre  pNow, if you think that there is a better way to achieve the whole licensing architecture under these constraints, please feel free comment and give feedback.p

Negative 60836 pI have the following setup There is a single client, multiple workers, and a single sink. The workers receive job requests from the client via a ZeroMQ message. They work on the input, and send the answer to another process sink. Processing a message takes about 1ms, and we need to process about 50,000 messagessec  which means we need more than 50 workers to handle the load.p  pI tried a simple setup, in which the client creates a single ZeroMQ PUSH socket, to which all the workers connect via a PULL socket. Similarly, the sink creates a single PULL socket to which all the workers connect with a PUSH socket.p  pIIUC, ZeroMQ sends the messages to workers using round robin  each time another worker gets the job. This setup seems to work efficiently enough with  10 workers and appropriate load. However, when increasing the number of workers and the load further, this breaks very quickly and the system starts to accumulate delays.p  pI know there are several patterns that take care of the load balancing problem, however they are geared towards multiple clients and require a router in between, which means additional code  cpu cycles. The question isp  p1 What would be the best pattern to use in case of single client, multiple workers, single sinkp  p2 Is it possible to do this without a router between the client and the workers, by routing on the client side insteadp  p3 What kind of ZeroMQ sockets should be usedp  pThanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnl4I1.jpg altDiagramp  pEDIT Adding the code.p  pClientp  precode    void context  zmqctxnew         Socket to send messages on     void sender  zmqsocket context, ZMQPUSH     zmqbind sender, tcp5557        Socket to send start of batch message on     void sink  zmqsocket context, ZMQPUSH     zmqconnect sink, tcplocalhost5558      printf Press Enter when the workers are ready      getchar      printf Sending tasks to workersn        The first message is 0 and signals start of batch     ssend sink, 0      unsigned long i     const int nmsgs  atoiargv[1]     const int nmsgssec  atoiargv[2]     const int buffsize  1024  1KB msgs     unsigned long t, tstart     tstart  timestamp     for i  0 i lt nmsgs i              t  timestamp              Pace the sending according to nmsgssec             while i  1000000  t1tstart gt nmsgssec                       busy wait                     t  timestamp                          char buffer [buffsize]              Write current timestamp in the packet beginning             sprintf buffer, lu, t             zmqsend sender, buffer, buffsize, 0          printfTotal time lu ms Planned time d msn, timestamp  tstart1000, nmsgs  1000  nmsgssec      zmqclose sink     zmqclose sender     zmqctxdestroy context codepre  pWorkerp  precode  Socket to receive messages on void context  zmqctxnew  void receiver  zmqsocket context, ZMQPULL zmqconnect receiver, receiveraddr    Socket to send messages to void sender  zmqsocket context, ZMQPUSH zmqconnect sender, senderaddr    Process tasks forever const int buffsize  1024 char buffer[buffsize] while 1      zmqrecv receiver, buffer, buffsize, 0     ssend sender, buffer  zmqclose receiver zmqclose sender zmqctxdestroy context codepre  pSinkp  precode  Prepare our context and socket void context  zmqctxnew  void receiver  zmqsocket context, ZMQPULL zmqbind receiver, tcp5558    Wait for start of batch char string  srecv receiver free string  unsigned long t1 unsigned long maxdt  0 unsigned long sumdt  0  int tasknbr int nmsgs  atoiargv[1] printfnmsgs  dn, nmsgs for tasknbr  0 tasknbr lt nmsgs tasknbr      char string  srecv receiver     t1  timestamp     unsigned long t0  atollstring     free string      unsigned long dt  t1t0     maxdt  maxdt gt dt  maxdt  dt     sumdt  dt      iftasknbr  10000  0              printfd lun, tasknbr, dt        printfAverage time lu usectMax time lu usecn, sumdtnmsgs, maxdt  zmqclose receiver zmqctxdestroy context codepre

Negative 60836 pI found some code online and copied it, so far I have been able to get everything right except for one thing which is I want to make the form window completely borderless.p  pIm using Visual Studio 2013 and this question is simply about the code that is needed to make the form window borderless. The problem is that when you make it borderless, its no longer resizable but when it has a border, it can be resized.p  pI know using some code its possible to override and achieve both. This is what I have so far copied from another website. This gets rid of the top bar which has the program name, makes the form movable by clicking and dragging the form, and its resizable.p  pOnly problem is that the border is still there. What code can I add to this so the border will be gone I want to keep this current code because its serving a couple of features I need already.p  pBy the way, I looked at some older questions with similar topics but didnt find the right code I need.p  pFor the mod who directed me to another thread I tried the code there and its not exactly what Im trying to achieve although its a similar problem. When I tried that code, I couldnt click anywhere on the form window to move it. Plus, it had one resizable corner at the bottom right which is not what Im looking for.

Instead of extracting a codedictcode of BrandltRevenue pairs, I could extract a list or tuple of tuples of Product, Brand, Revenue, and now we have the additional information provided by the emProductem column.

Negative 60836 pIve looked at previous similar problem but still cant seem to find a solution.p  pIm running bacpypes for BACnet and the problem I am running into is when I host an application, the application tries to bind to 2 sockets, one is a unicast and another is a broadcastbroadcast is used to discover devices on a subnet.

Have not yet figured out why it is not working on windows.p  pthe address of a device in BACnet is usually the ip  the udp port, but to allow broadcasting you have to add your masking so it can determine the broadcast ip of your subnet, so for example if I want my device to listen for any incoming requests, or listen to any codebroadcastcode requests, I would do  code192.168.0.302447810code which should bind to 2 address code192.168.0.3047810code and code192.168.0.25547810code if my subnet mask is code255.255.255.0codep  pHere is a stack trace for when I try and launchp  precodeDEBUGbacpypes.udp.UDPDirectorinit 192.168.0.30, 47810 timeout0 reuseFalse actorClassltclass bacpypes.udp.UDPActorgt sidNone sapIDNone DEBUGbacpypes.udp.UDPDirector     getsockname 192.168.0.30, 47810 DEBUGbacpypes.udp.UDPDirectorinit 192.168.0.255, 47810 timeout0 reuseTrue actorClassltclass bacpypes.udp.UDPActorgt sidNone sapIDNone ERRORmainan error has occurred [Errno 10049] The requested address is not valid in its context Traceback most recent call last   File CUserskbPycharmProjectsBACpypesSampleApplication.py, line 84, in ltmodulegt     thisapplication  SampleApplicationthisdevice, args.ini.address   File CUserskbPycharmProjectsBACpypesSampleApplication.py, line 39, in init     BIPSimpleApplication.initself, device, address   File buildbdist.win32eggbacpypesapp.py, line 575, in init     self.mux  UDPMultiplexerself.localAddress   File buildbdist.win32eggbacpypesbvllservice.py, line 91, in init     self.broadcastPort  udp.UDPDirectorself.addrBroadcastTuple, reuseTrue   File buildbdist.win32eggbacpypesudp.py, line 144, in init     self.bindaddress   File CPython27libasyncore.py, line 342, in bind     return self.socket.bindaddr   File CPython27libsocket.py, line 228, in meth     return getattrself.sock,nameargs error [Errno 10049] The requested address is not valid in its context codepre  pside note, everything is run as admin so.. just in case yall are wondering..p

Negative 60836 pI have a base class K and A, B, C models extend from K, using STI in rails. p  precodeclass K lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany x, classname X end class A lt K end class B lt K end codepre  pAnother model X has codekidcode as foreign key and an enum field codekindcodep  precodeclass X lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto k   validatespresenceof kind   enum kind [kinda1, kinda2, kinda3, kindb1, kindb2, kindb3]  and so on end codepre  pThe codekindcode field values are strictly mapped to type of model K. So, model A will havemany X but of type can be only any one of [kinda1, ... kindan], and so on.  p  pHaving a X object codexcode , I can tell what type of K, it belongs to A,B or C.  And for model K, I can tell what available kinds are present for its new x object based on type.p  pI need to put validations such that object of model B cannot have codexcode object of kind kinda1, etc.  Also, theres a model P which hasmany Ks of all types. p  precodeclass P lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany x, classname X   hasmany a, foreignkey kid, classname A   hasmany b, foreignkey kid, classname B end codepre  pMethods in P behave differently based on type figuring out type of K from the kind of X.p  pcodeP.addthisxtok x code So, strongthis method will add x to A,B or C depending on kind of x.strongp  pObviously, codekindcode is mutually exclusive for K types. So, A and B will not share same kind of Xs. Otherwise, P.addthisxtok wont work. p  pNow, my problem is how do I implement such design in Rails.  I can think of maintaining a config.yml file which can tell me what codekindcodes  are available for a X that belongs to ABC. p  precodeA   kinda1   kinda2 B   kindb1   kindb2 codepre  pValidations for X would go like p  precodedef validatekindforK     errors.addkind, kind not available for K type unless  if config[A].include kind  end codepre  pIs this a good way  I feel weird about this approach, so what improvements or better way to design such a logic. If this solution works, how do I get type of K depending on kind of X. p  pEdit Basically i have kind enum in X. X belongsto K. A lt K. B lt K. Xs kind enum if K is type A is smaller exclusive set S1, S2 if K is type B etc. So, enum kind  S1  S2  more. enum values will keep on increasing in future. How to implement such logic  p
