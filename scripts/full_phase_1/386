Positive 386 pIm trying to set up two VMs with Vagrant, and one of them needs to be able to ssh into the second one using the private key.p  pI defined both VMs inside one vagrantfile, started them up and then copied the private key from the .vagrant directory into my first VM. I was then able to ssh into the second VM without a password.p  pThe problem is that this is not stable, Vagrant recycles this key each time I do codevagrant upcode and creates a new one. This obviously breaks the ability to ssh from the first VM to the second one until I copy the private key again.p  pI dont particularly care which key exactly Vagrant uses, I just want it to be stable so that I can always ssh between my VMs. How can I do thatp

Positive 386 pI tried setting up public and private keys on two computers clementine amp cfmi so that I can ssh between them without using a password.  However, I am still being requested for a password despite my inclusion of the public key in the authorized keys file under .ssh.  p  pI can log into the cfmi server when I attempt to connect from clementine, however I am prompted for my password.  p  pHowever when I try to connect from the cfmi server to clementine, I am prompted for a password that doesnt  match the root password I have on that computer.  Thus I cant log on from cfmi to clementine. p  pIt gets even more mysterious... The password works just fine when I am sshing from my iphone on the local network.p  pIt may also be relevant that I must first connect to a VPN network using Cisco AnyConnect and only then can I ssh into cfmi since it is firewalled.p  pCan anyone help me figure out how to get the keys to work and how to reset my password to ssh into Clementinep  pHere are the contents amp permissions of the .ssh

Negative 386 pWhat is a fast and efficient way to implement the serverside component for an autocomplete feature in an html input box p  pI am writing a service to autocomplete user queries in our web interfaces main search box, and the completions are displayed in an ajaxpowered dropdown. The data we are running queries against is simply a large table of concepts our system knows about, which matches roughly with the set of wikipedia page titles. For this service obviously speed is of utmost importance, as responsiveness of the web page is important to the user experience. p  pThe current implementation simply loads all concepts into memory in a sorted set, and performs a simple logn lookup on a user keystroke. The tailset is then used to provide additional matches beyond the closest match. The problem with this solution is that it does not scale. It currently is running up against the VM heap space limit Ive set Xmx2g, which is about the most we can push on our 32 bit machines, and this prevents us from expanding our concept table or adding more functionality. Switching to 64bit VMs on machines with more memory isnt an immediate option. p  pIve been hesitant to start working on a diskbased solution as I am concerned that disk seek time will kill performance. Are there possible solutions that will let me scale better, either entirely in memory or with some fast diskbacked implementationsp  pEditsp  pGandalf For our use case it is important the the autocompletion is comprehensive and isnt just extra help for the user. As for what we are completing, it is a list of concepttype pairs. For example, possible entries are [Microsoft, Software Company, Jeff Atwood, Programmer, StackOverflow.com, Website]. We are using Lucene for the full search once a user selects an item from the autocomplete list, but I am not yet sure Lucene would work well for the autocomplete itself.p  pGlen No databases are being used here. When Im talking about a table I just mean the structured representation of my data.p  pJason Day My original implementation to this problem was to use a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrie relnofollowTriea, but the memory bloat with that was actually worse than the sorted set due to needing a large number of object references. Ill read on the ternary search trees to see if it could be of use.p

This works and shows all Entities, since the Method to retrieve the Entities does not have a where clause. This Method was automatically created.p  pNow I want to have a second similar Method, that filters the options based on a variable in the sessionscope. To do this I copied the original Method, renamed it to getEntityNameSelectListByUserUser theUser and changed the Method that queries the database to one that does indeed filter by UserId.p  pHowever, when trying to load the page in the browser, I get an error stating that the controller class does not have a EntityNameSelectListByUser property. I assume that since my new method expects a parameter it cant be found. Is there a way I can make it aware of the Parameter or the Sessionscope useridp

Negative 386 pThink tictactoe. You are creating the buttons in rows and columns and you want to set the width and height of the parent window actually, the size of the windows contentView, right. But maybe you want to sometimes use a 4x4 grid or 5x5, so you cant use a default window setting.p  pI iterate and do math to determine the positioning of the buttons. There is the space padding the inside of the window and a separate value for padding between buttons, so its not completely straightforward. I think itd be cleaner not to have to do that math in two places to set the window size, if I could avoid it.p  pI suppose I could set the window size correctly each time I add a button, but thats kind of silly. Or maybe its not, since its not going to draw it until Im donep  pedit I just dont want to have two pieces of different math and have to make sure theyre drawing the same conclusion, you knowp

Negative 386 pI have a MS SQL database with a table that stores geocoded PICKUP locations which I eventually may or may not want to display depending on search filters the user selects. These are not static like a brick and mortar store locations. They are added by the applications users 24 hrs a day. The life of a LOAD is less than 24 Hrs. Once it has been picked up, the load is removed from the table. A LOAD is defined in the table with some basic demographic details along with specific LAT and LONG.p  pI am planning on using OpenStreetMaps to provide my base maps and also my interstateroadway information.

For example, I95.p  pSo if a user selects the I95 Shipping Lane as a search filter, I only want the map to display LOADS that meet the following criteriap  ol liThe LOAD is along the shipping lane defined.li liThe LOAD is within a specific proximity of the shipping lane for example, the load is located 3 miles off of I95 in Richmond, VA. Ideally this would be based off of an actual interstate exit not just randomly along the highway somewhere.li ol  pAll this leads me to 2 questions....p  pQ1 When a user posts a LOAD to the database, how bounce the LAT and LONG off something to determine what Shipping Lanes could be more than depending where interstates cross each other it is along this could also be done at the time of searching but I think it would save processing to define this ahead of time unless it can not be done that way.p  pQ2 How can I tell if the LOAD is located X miles off of a given Shipping Lanep

Negative 386 pIm making a canvasbased game engine and am wondering if anyone has any good info on how to achieve an overhead view perspective. What Im looking for is somewhere halfway between the traditional birds eye view and the old SNES mode7 view. Just a slight angle to give the illusion of 3D.p  pIm trying to figure out what is going to be the best way to deal with the perspective skewing. Im not doing rotations so 3D matrix stuff would be going overboard, but I need to be able to deal with rendering the map layers at a consistent angle and itd be nice if the angle was adjustable. I also need to deal with the depth warp. Basically, the bottom row of pixels should be 11 pixel width and height, then for each row itd get, for example, 5 smaller or something like that. What Id like is to be able to supply a large canvas as a texture and then supply a camera angle between 0 and 90 where 0 is perfectly horizontal and 90 is birds eye view.p  pAnyone have any related tutorials or sample code Ive searched online a bit, but everything Ive found seems to either be unsuitable for use in this particular application or overly complex, doing all sorts of crazy 3D skewing and rotation stuff. All I want is to take the normal tiled grid and lean it back a bit, no rotations or complicated stuff like that.p  pHeres an example of what I want img srchttpimg801.imageshack.usimg8012176perspectivesample.jpg altHeres an example.p  pThe bottom pixel row is 11 pixel ratio, and each row above that progressively gets shorter horizontally and vertically. The source texture of the top center region is normally about half the height of the bottom center region, but it has been shrunk vertically and horizontally to fit the perspective.p  pWhat Im thinking might work best is to render the current viewport state to another canvas in flat, birds eye view, with approximately 50 extra space on the top and sides, then slice an upside triangular region from that and draw that to the actual visible canvas.p  pOnly problem is, I suck at math when it comes to calculating angles and such.p

Negative 386 pI need a regex that is to be used for text substitution. Example text to be matched is codeABCcode which could be surrounded by square brackets, substitution text is codeDEFcode. This is basic enough.

[xxx xxx].[ABC] gt [xxx xxx].[ABC] does not match  first part fits the pattern 2. [xxx xxx].ABC   gt [xxx xxx].ABC   does not match  first part fits the pattern 3.

ABC             gt DEF             matches  no first part 6. [xxx][ABC]      gt [xxx][DEF]      matches  no period in between 7. [xxx].

Negative 386 pRecently, I have been writing many classes which have, apart from generic variant, some primitive variants, for example codeFooltTgtcode, codeIntFoocode, codeDoubleFoocode etc. First, I used to put every variant in separate files but I soon found out that the package content has become unreadable due to large number of classes with similar names.

Negative 386 pSo we have this somewhat unusual need in our product.  We have numerous processes running on the local host and need to construct a means of communication between them.  The difficulty is that ...p  ol liThere is no server or master processli liMessages will be broadcast to all listening nodesli liNodes are all Windows processes, but may be C or Cli liNodes will be running in both 32bit and 64bit simultaneouslyli liAny node can jump inout of the conversation at any timeli liA process abnormally terminating should not adversely affect other nodesli liA process responding slowly should also not adversely affect other nodesli liA node does not need to be listening to broadcast a messageli ol  pemA few more important details...emp  pThe messages we need to send are trivial in nature.  A name of the type of message and a single string argument would suffice.  p  pThe communications are not necessarily secure and do not need to provide any means of authentication or access control however, we want to group communications by a Windows Logon session.  Perhaps of interest here is that a nonelevated process should be able to interact with an elevated process and viseversa.p  pMy first question is there an existing opensource library, or something that can be used to fulfill this with little effort.  As of now I havent been able to find anything p  pIf a library doesnt exist for this then... What technologies would you use to solve this problem  Sockets, namedpipes, memory mapped files, event handles  It seems like connection based transports socketspipes would be a bad idea in a fully connected graph since n nodes requires nn1 number of connections.  Using event handles and some form of shared storage seems the most plausible solution right now... p  pstrongUpdatesstrongp  ul lipDoes it have to be reliable and guaranteed Yes, and no...

All classes that need logging must be configured, which would be more resource intensive than just using annotations. Would the spring configuration codeltaopaspectjautoproxygtcode fix thatp

Negative 386 pI have a logger class in PHP, but that does not matter which spits out log messages. The logger is a custom implementation and works well. However, I would like to extend it to provide a event ID with each emtypeem of logger message. Such that User logged in messages are event ID 1, Form validation failed is event ID 2, for example. p  pThe purpose of this event ID is to filter unimportant events when a long list of logs is viewed. I believe it would be quicker to categorize logs by event ID and faster to query than doing substring searches in a database.p  pI have the following ideas, but welcome viable alternatives. I used PHP in this example, but something that is generic enough that it could be applied to most languages such as PHPJavaCetc would be useful. p  pstrong1 Include an ID implicitly in the log function callstrongp  precodeabstract class EventId      const LOGIN  1     const VALIDATIONFAILURE  2      etc    LoggermessageDebugEventIDLOGIN, username .  logged in  LoggermessageWarningEventIDVALIDATIONFAILURE, Form failed to validate, etc. codepre  pThe advantages of this are simplicity, but I fear it could get a little messy. p  pstrong2 Pass variable parameters to log messages as separate arguments, then hash the first stringstrongp  precodeLoggermessageDebugs logged in, username LoggermessageWarningThe s form failed to validate, form  codepre  pThe advantages are simplicity, the disadvantages are the event ID depends upon hashing or some other function of the first string to differentiate the types of log messages. p  pstrong3 Backtrace and do some nastynessstrongp  precodefunction messageDebugmessage       trace  obtainTraceOfCallToMessageDebug     callToMessageDebug  trace[0]      eventId       eventId . eventIdgtfile     eventId . eventIdgtline     eventId  sha1eventId        messageImpleventId, message  codepre  pThis is pretty nasty, but it does have an advantage in that existing log messages do not need to be changed, additionally it is less fragile when writing new log messages. In PHP, obtaining a backtrace is easy and sort of cheap, in other languages you may have to throw an Exception which is super nasty. Anyway, its an idea.p  pLooking forward to your opinions. My main requirement is maintainability rather than speed. I am currently looking towards number 1  keep it simple. p

Negative 386 pIm helping to build a GWT application for a client and rewrote most of the stuff to work better, shorter code, faster, etc. However in all the GUI application Ive worked on not so many really there comes a flexing point where you just have to put a lot of rules and move logic from the listeners to some common mediator. Then some times this could get an ugly mess so you whatever small think you need to do in the listener.p  pLets take an examplep  ul liform with 1020 fieldsli litwo exclusive radio control about half of the state of the other fields enabling, validation, input limitsli lithree exclusive radio controls control again almost the same fields, but in a different way affecting calculations, enabling they are also controlled by the aboveli li4 or so number fields are validated on the fly depending on the previous selections and some realtime data object they can have upperlower limits, be enableddisabledli lione dropdown box controls the next 6 or so controls  displayinghiding them, modifying validatorsli lisome checkboxes shown by the above combo activate some input fields and also determine their validation algorithmli ul  pWhile everything is up an running, without known bugs, there are a few coding gotchas that really bother mep  ul licode is spread among listeners and some mediator methods.li liloading the form with some preset values presents its own challenges like data objects that might be available or not, data objects that might alter their state and subsequent field behaviourli lisome fields are having a default value set and this should not be overwritten by automatic filling, but if the data objects are not there yet then they will need to be filled eventually when the later become availableli liform cannot be submitted if any of the fields are not validatedli ul  pMy approachp  ul liidentify which fields share a common afair and move code into one placeli lieach radio group shares a single listener implementation between its radiosli lidefault form filling is deferred until the live data is available as much as possible and as a result it gets called multiple timesli lieach action has a call to a common validator methodli lithe validator runs through all the fields in the form, calls their validators which highlight all errors and returns a single booleanli lieach relevant keypress or mouse action, data change it gets deferred to be called after 250ms from the last call this means first call just places the validator as a delayed action, subsequent calls reset the timerli ul  pOk, it doesnt make any sense to dwelve into more details but Im more upset about the fact that there is no clear separation between visual actions enabling, data actions setting form field values, field listeners, retrieving form values and live data listeners.p  pWhat would be a good approachpattern next time maybe to make sure that MVC get separated and lends itself better to maintenance I know this is not a typical question but Ive read every documentation I could get my hands on and still did not find some helpful answer.p

Negative 386 pIm working on a Java Game and Ive come to a point where Im having problems with the KeyListenersKeyBinding. What I basically want to do is temporarily disable the keyboarddo not allow more inputs when an animation occurs. This animation is generated by updating data. p  pWhat I currently get is that I press the key for the animation, the animation starts, and I press another key that does some other function. It gets added to the stackqueue of the keyboardlistener and triggers when the first animation finishes. p  pIm using a JPanel that implements KeyListener.p  pTo give an idea of the codep  precode    public void keyPressedKeyEvent arg0        Prevents Repeated keys       pressed.addarg0       if pressed.size  1              int key  KeyEvent pressed.toArray[0].getKeyCode             if key  KeyEvent.VKENTER                  doSomeAnimation              else if key  KeyEvent.VKSPACE                  doADifferentAnimation                           Update        codepre  pThings Ive triedp  p1 Set the focusablefalse on the JPanel before the calls to the animations. Then set the focusabletrue and grab the focus when theyve been completed.p  p2 Used a boolean to track when an animation occurred. p  p3 Use Key Bindings.p  pNo matter what method I used, I always ended up with the problem that I would still take in input from the keyboard when the animation was occurring. Then, once that animation was finished, itd go to the next element in the stackqueue and process that. Also, these animations would need to occur more than once so using an array of booleans to verify if its been executed already wouldnt be helpful.p  pSo, if you have any idea or help or places to point me to that would be greatly appreciated.p  pSome Extra Information Java 1.6, IDE Eclipse, MVC structure.

Negative 386 pIm currently developing an OpenCLapplication for a very heterogeneous set of computers using JavaCL to be specific. In order to maximize performance I want to use a GPU if its available otherwise I want to fall back to the CPU and use SIMDinstructions. My plan is to implement the OpenCLcode using vectortypes because my understanding is that this allows CPUs to vectorize the instructions and use SIMDinstructions. p  pMy question however is regarding which OpenCLimplementation to use. E.g. if the computer has a Nvidia GPU I assume its best to use Nvidias library but if no GPU is available I want to use Intels library to use the SIMDinstructions.p  pHow do I achieve this Is this handled automatically or do I have to include all libraries and implement some logic to pick the right one It feels like this is a problem that more people than I are facing. p  pstrongUpdatestrong After testing the different OpenCLdrivers this is my experience so farp  ul lipstrongIntelstrong crashed the JVM when JavaCL tried to call it. After a restart it didnt crash the JVM but it also didnt return any usable devices I was using an Intel I7CPU. When I compiled the OpenCLcode offline it seemed to be able to do some autovectorization so Intels compiler seems quite nice. pli lipstrongNvidiastrong Refused to install their WHQLdrivers because it claimed I didnt have Nvidiacard that computer has a Geforce GT 330M. When I tried it on a different computer I managed to get all the way to create a kernel but at the first execution it crashed the drivers the screen flickered for a while and Windows 7 said it had to restart the drivers. The second execution caused a blueescreen of death.pli lipstrongAMDATIstrong Refused to install 32bit SDK I tried that since I will be using a 32bit JVM but 64bit SDK worked well. This is the only driver which Ive managed to execute the code on after a restart because at first it gave a cryptic errormessage when compiling. However it doesnt seem to be able to do any implicit vectorization and since I dont have any ATI GPU I didnt get any performance increase compared to the Javaimplementation. If I use vectortypes I might see some improvements though.pli ul  pstrongTLDRstrong None of the drivers seem ready for commercial use. Im probably better of creating JNImodule with Ccode compiled to use SSEinstructions.p

Negative 386 pIm working on a project that includes WebSockets, and data between the server Node.js and the client Chrome is sent using a custom very simple format for data exchange I set up.p  pIm sending data in pieces of 3 bits because Im sending items which all have 8 possibilities.

The problem is that its only complex because Im getting data in bytes, which are a multiple of 8. To parse out items of 3 bits I have to bitshift, doing AND operations, and because 8 is not divisible by 3 I sometimes even have to combine parts of two bytes like for codeitemCcode.p  pIt would be much more effective to read this data as groups of 3 bits instead of groups of 8 bits.p  pWhat Ive come up with is converting all bytes into bits to a string using code.toString2code, then using code.substringcode to get a substring with length 3, and converting back to a number with codeparseIntbitString, 2code, but I guess thats not the way to do it, since string manipulation is slow and Im actually not doing anything stringrelated.p  pIs it possible to read bits in groups of e.g. 3 instead of parsing them from bytes Or is there a more efficient way to read bits out of bytesp

Negative 386 pOnce before, I was certain that you couldnt do this, but the other day I was playing around with some code and it seemed to compile and work. I just want to verify that I am not just getting lucky. Can a template class have a pure virtual function  which I guess would also mean just plain virtual methods would be valid as well for the destructorp  precodetemplate lttypename WordTypegt class DataSource  public     DataSource     DataSourceDataSource constamp other     virtual DataSource      virtual void Put         WordType const const data,         unsigned int const wordCount  0  codepre  pIve tried looking it up online and all that Ive been able to find is that you cannot have a virtual method pure or otherwise in a normal class such as thisp  precodeclass DataSource  public     DataSource     DataSourceDataSource constamp other     virtual DataSource      template lttypename WordTypegt     virtual void Put         WordType const const data,         unsigned int const wordCount  0  codepre  pAnd that this is due to the imposibility of managing a virtual table to reference all the different types of possible types this method would be instanciated with.p  pHowever, when it came to a virtual member function of a template class, it seems to be different because the whole class itself is created via the template parameter when the template class variable is instanciated. At this point, the virtual method is just like any other virual method of a class due to the findandreplace nature of templates.p  pAnyway, stating the question again in case it got lost in there Are virtual pure andor normal virtual functions allowed within a tempate classp

Negative 386 pAs I understand it, the typical case of a deadlock involving rowlocking requires four SQL statements. Two in one transaction to update row A and row B, and then a further two in a separate transaction to update the same rows, and require the same locks, but in the reverse order. p  pTransaction 1 gets the lock on row A before transaction 2 can request it, transaction 2 gets the lock on row B before transaction 1 can get it, and neither can get the remaining required locks. One or either transaction has to be rolled back, so the other can complete.p  pWhen I review an Oracle trace file after a deadlock, it only seems to highlight two queries. These seem to be the last one out of each transaction.p  pHow can I identify the other statements involved in each transaction, or is this missing in an Oracle trace filep  pI can include relevant bits of the specific trace file if required.p
Negative 386 pIn the book a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1584506806Game Coding Complete, 3rd Edition,a the author mentions a technique to both reduce data structure size emandem increase access performance. In essence it relies on the fact that you gain performance when member variables are memory aligned. This is an obvious potential optimization that compilers would take advantage of, but by making sure each variable is aligned they end up bloating the size of the data structure.p  pOr that was his claim at least.p  pThe real performance increase, he states, is by using your brain and ensuring that your structure is properly designed to take take advantage of speed increases while preventing the compiler bloat. He provides the following code snippetp  precodepragma pack push, 1   struct SlowStruct      char c     int64 a     int b     char d   struct FastStruct      int64 a     int b     char c     char d       char unused[ 2 ]  fill to 8byte boundary for array use   pragma pack pop  codepre  pUsing the above codestructcode objects in an unspecified test he reports a performance increase of code15.6code code222mscode compared to code192mscode and a smaller size for the codeFastStructcode. This all makes sense on paper to me, but it fails to hold up under my testingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGf6yK.png altenter image description herep  pSame time results emandem size counting for the codechar unused[ 2 ]codep  pNow if the codepragma pack push, 1 code is isolated only to codeFastStructcode or removed completely we do see a differencep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjblLW.png altenter image description herep  pSo, finally, here lies the question Do modern compilers VS2010 specifically already optimize for the bit alignment, hence the lack of performance increase but increase the structure size as a sideaffect, like Mike Mcshaffry stated Or is my test not intensive enoughinconclusive to return any significant resultsp  pFor the tests I did a variety of tasks from math operations, columnmajor multidimensional array traversingchecking, matrix operations, etc. on the unaligned codeint64code member. None of which produced different results for either structure.p  pIn the end, even if their was no performance increase, this is still a useful tidbit to keep in mind for keeping memory usage to a minimum. But I would love it if there was a performance boost no matter how minor that I am just not seeing.p

Negative 386 pOur database includes a USERS table for storing userspecific data, and each user has a status, either codeactivecode or codeinactivecode. It suffices to indicate the status using a codeisactivecode boolean field in the USERS table.p  pAt the same time, for inactive users, we keep additional information in another field, which is irrelevant and therefore set to null for users in the opposite active status.p  pMy question Is it a better design to keep the codeisactivecode boolean field in the USERS table to clearly indicate the status, or actually derive the status based on the available secondary criteria the availability of the additional info, which is present always and only if the user is in status inactivep  pThat is, it looks like the codeisactivecode field is redundant with regards to DB normalization, but at the same time, the logic that can be used for deriving it isnt so obvious at first grasp and that makes queries concerning the status seem cumbersome and containing nonexplicit logic.p

Negative 386 pSo I am trying to redirect all image requests from my server to use a custom PHP script.  The PHP script is built into a framework which can be accessed through a hrefhttpwww.domain.comimagesimageNameHere.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comimagesimageNameHere.jpga  The user obviously doesnt know that the image is being served to them.  So now the problem is that this method is currently working for the top level of it, but for the backend its causing a lot of issues.  For instance if I try to use another PHP function such as getimagesize on this image I am returned with an error that it cant open the stream.p  pLooking further into the matter I noticed that all of the headers for these images are generating 404 not found errors.  Found this out by using header detection tools online and then seeing in the errorlog that every image loaded comes up with a 404 not found error  Needless to say I cant have this, and I need all the requests to be 200s.  I feel like doing this will help to fix the issue.p  pThis is my current .htaccess file, I am not exactly sure how to set it up to pass these images through the system and not treat them as a file but rather as a URIp  precode Turn on URL rewriting RewriteEngine On   Installation directory RewriteBase    Protect hidden files from being viewed ltFiles .gt     Order Deny,Allow     Deny From All ltFilesgt  RewriteCond HTTPHOST i.tinyuploadz.com RewriteRule . httpwww.tinyuploadz.comimagesREQUESTURI [NC,L,NS]   Protect application and system files from being viewed RewriteRule applicationmodulessystemb. index.php0 [L]   Allow any files or directories that exist to be displayed directly RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d   Image rediects RewriteRule images..jpg images1.jpg [PT]   Rewrite all other URLs to index.phpURL RewriteRule . index.php0 [PT]   Fix the CSS an d JS RewriteRule ..[d]10.cssjs 1.2 [L]   Do not let people browse our directories Options Indexes codepre  pHere is how I have my PHP function set up currently this is the view generated by the controllerp  precodeday  dated, image[uploadtime] month  datem, image[uploadtime] year  dateY, image[uploadtime] url  IMAGEURL .  year .  . month .  . day .  . image[imageid] . . . image[extension]  headerContenttype  . image[mime] switch image[extension]      case png         img  imagecreatefrompngurl         imagepngimg         imagedestroyimg         break     case jpg     case jpeg         img  imagecreatefromjpegurl         imagejpegimg         imagedestroyimg         break     case gif         if isaniurl                      readfileurl             break                  img  imagecreatefromgifurl         imagegifimg         imagedestroyimg         break     case bmp          Seems like we cant do anything special for bmps         readfileurl         break     default         readfileurl         break  readfileurl . image[imageid] . . . image[extension]   We dont want Kohana to break anything else with the header change exit  function isanifilename       iffh  fopenfilename, rb         return false     count  0     an animated gif contains multiple frames, with each frame having a      header made up of       a static 4byte sequence x00x21xF9x04       4 variable bytes       a static 2byte sequence x00x2C some variants may use x00x21        We read through the file til we reach the end of the file, or weve found       at least 2 frame headers     whilefeoffh ampamp count lt 2               chunk  freadfh, 1024  100 read 100kb at a time         count  pregmatchallx00x21xF9x04.4x00x2Cx21s, chunk, matches           fclosefh     return count gt 1  codepre  pThanks for any help on the matter p

Negative 386 pa hrefhttpbuildinternet.comprojectsupersized relnofollowhttpbuildinternet.comprojectsupersizedap  pIm having trouble figuring out the javascript that goes along with this jquery plugin. What Im trying to do is merge this with more js plugins, namely, an accordion plugin I have. The end goal is to essentially have two instances of Supersized running on one screen with the same controls, different images. I know, hard to envision but heres an example.p  pThe body is full screen background with Supersized, the image is image1.jpg and its black and white. Then, I have a smaller div, 960px wide in the center of the body, with an accordion of all the images I want, but in color. So as you change the accordion, you change the background. So when you have image1.jpg in color in the accordion box, the background of body is image1.jpg black and white. p  pSo Im having trouble because the js for supersized seems to only define a prev and next thumbnail, not ALL the thumbnails. So in theory I would have to figure out how to disoplay all thumbnails and then figure out how to alter these thumbnails images so that it is still controlling the slide transitions, but not actually the thumbnails for the background. In that way, I can then set the accordion slides to those thumbnails instead but have them control both the accordion and the background.p  pIm sure Im being very confusing right now, so if you have any questions, ask away. Thanks.p

Negative 386 pI am in the middle of creating a multiplayer game ios app and was considering using facebooks graph to connect players in the same way as the with Friends.  My question is, what is the best and most efficient way to connect the users stored on my database with each other using the facebook graphp  pMy initial thought is Lets say person A gets the app and registers with facebook, then person B, a friend of person A, registers with the app using facebook.  When person B registers, should I check all of the existing players to see which of them are FB friends with himher and then connect them in my database  So in this case, the search through the current users would find person A, and make a connection between person A and person B.  This way, when A wants to challenge a friend to a game, the data is readily available for who he can challenge in this case, only person B.  p  pIm sure this isnt the best way, so any ideas are appreciated.  And I am using Django as my backend if that makes any difference in the question.p

Luckily, 1 I took plenty of screenshots of the relevant tables in phpmyadmin before I removed the indexes and fields 2 I can explain with extreme precision the steps I took before the import and 3 this shouldnt be too difficult for anyone fluent in MySQL. Unfortunately, I have no expertise in MySQL whatsoever, so baby steps explanations would be extremely helpful.p  pstrongPRECISELY WHAT I DID PREPARING FOR THE IMPORTstrongp  pSteps 1, 2, 3 This image depicts the table strongpagestrong before I modified the field strongpageidstrong by clicking Change and unchecking AutoIncrement in preparation for importing.

Negative 386 pIm helping my father with some technical stuff for his business and cant seem to find an answer to a seemingly simple task.  He has given me several printed forms that he would like to put on his website for clients to fill out, rather than having them do it physically and scanning the form to a PDF each time. p  pI have figured out how to create the form in Dreamweaver and submit to an email, but Im trying to figure out a way to submit the form via email as an attached PDF file that shows the contents of the form exactly as it looks on the website logos, fields, etc., while saving it with a unique name such as last name or date on the form.  p  pI have a little experience with PHP but not enough to figure out how to write a script for this purpose or even where to start on a task like this.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciatedp  pThank you p

Negative 386 pthis isnt a syntax coding specific question per se, but Im unable to find any real articles online of any significance that speak to it directly.

Negative 386 pI am writing a basic web browser that can only go to a certain website developed and maintained by another company for my work, however in order for the log in and the time spent on the site to be counted two VERY important things for my company you need to log out with a certain button on the site. I looked at the page source and all that button does is call a javascript function named something like doLogoff or something similar which on a normal browser simply closes the window that is created after you log in. In my application everything is done in ONE window, there are no tabs there are no need for them and Im not entirely sure what the call to close the window does to my application, but the site on the WebView simply stays on that page and only goes back to the login page if you click on a link.p  pIs there anyway to detect when a certain JavaScript function is called in a WebView If I can bind that function and make sure the log out is actually being performed, then I can just make the webview go to the login page myself.p

Negative 386 pIm developing an application for DOS. I need to communicate via parallel port.p  pCurrently Im stuck at how can I determine which of the PCI functions BARBase address registers contain the base addressie data port address for that parallel port p  pPrecisely, is there a industry convention or standard or defacto standard that a particular BAR will always contain the base address for that parallel port p  pIf not, then how can I determine the base address for that PCI parallel portwhether on pci expansion card or integrated on mobop  pActually Im concerned with parallel ports on emPCI expansion cardsem. AFAIK, BIOS doesnt know about these. BIOS will only allocate resources to the pci cards and thats it. So, there might not be the entries for such parallel ports in BDA, as BIOS manufacturer knows only about ALL the devices their mobo has.p  pFor eg, say on a PC, I installed 4 parallel ports on pci expansion cards , and there is 1 parallel port integratedembedded on mobo. Now where does the entry for other 2 parallel ports gop  pThats why it seems that the BIOS has entries only for emthreeem parallel ports integrated  embedded on chipset or motherboard. So, I think we must read PCI BARs to get the base address for any parallel port on pci expansion card installed on mobo.p  pThanksp

Now, since I do have a background with web development, I understand the concepts but I want to get serious in order to develop a strong portfolio this year with the vision of developing fulltime after college.p  pIm going to focus on Ruby on Rails, and after reading bookstutorials, I have a bunch of topics that I think I should cover, but I want an experienced view on what I should learn and in what order. Here are the topics that Ive come acrossp  ul liRuby on Rails    li liPhotoshop designing and slicingli liHTML5CSS Bootstrap Framework Boilerplate    li liHAMLSASSli lijQueryBackbone.jsNode.jsCoffeescript complete newbie to Javascript    li liRSpecCapybaraCucumber testing is RSpec necessary, or just CapybaraCucumberli liGitli ul  pAnything else that you guys can think of I feel there are now so many topics to learn, but by the Spring I want to have a solid foundation of web development where I can actually say Im a familiar web developer, so Im going to start developing a selflearning curriculum here.p  pI got this idea from Dev Bootcamp, but I dont have 11,000 to shell out for a 10 week program. Im going to teach it to myself instead by using resources here, books, and IRC. Do you have any suggested additional topicsmethods of learningcurriculum orderp  pThanks for all your help.p

Negative 386 pI have a Flex application and am having issues with secure logon  logoff to my Java server application. It works fine in the development environment FlashBuilder running the Flex and communicating with Apache Tomcat but fails when we try to use the exported flex application when deployed on the same Tomcat.p  pWe have a large, complex application with a Flex frontend and a Java backend which runs as a Web Application on Tomcat. We want the login  logout process to use HTTPS so that the username and password are encrypted and arent subject to certain security issues.p  pThe way that unsecured login works is via a BlazeDS RPC call to a method called login. The users credentials as parameters to the method. emQuick aside is this the recommended way of performing a loginemp  pSecure login works differently. A token is created from a channelSet which is supplied with the userid and password and an AsyncResponder calls the success or failure function. The login code is shown in update 2 below.p  pWhen I run my application in Flash Builder against an Apache Tomcat ver 7.0.29 secure login and logout succeed. This works regardless of if I am in standard run or debug mode.p  pHowever once I create my application and deploy it to my server then it fails with a very generic error.p  pI am convinced I have setup the HTTPS side of Tomcat correctly since the application works in the development environment. I believe that the issue lies in when the Flex application is running from codefile...index.htmlcode it works but as soon as I try to run it from codehttplocalhost8080MyAppcode it fails.p  pI have been pulling my hair out over this for days. Any pointers, documentation, etc. that anyone can give will be gratefully appreciated.p  pI decided not to include servicesconfig.xml, remotingconfig.xml, etc. files in this question since they are large and contain more than is relevant here, but I can supply them on request.p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pAfter reviewing the code I released Id made an error in this question.

Negative 386 pnbsp nbspI have searched on SO about this question, but I basically havent found one concerning this particular scenario hence, my reason for asking. br   nbsp nbsp I have a basic, abstract understanding of the MVC pattern Controller calls the right Model based on the action needed the Model contains the actual businessdata logic, and the View displays the result. What I am having trouble understanding is the actual implementation. br   nbsp nbspOriginally, my assumption was this Controller calls Model Model processes information, and strongreturnstrongs the data back to Controller Controller call the View, passing this  data to the View, which simply displays it. After reading more articles on MVC, I discovered that the Model doesnt really pass the data back to the Controller rather, it strongfiresstrong an event, which allows the Controller to call the proper View. br  My question centers on this strongevent firingstrong part br  br   nbsp nbspQ.1 Must an event really be fired Once the Model completes its processing, and returns control to the Controller, cant the Controller simply call the View br   nbsp nbspQ.2 In an actual implementation, a Model object is injected into a Controller class. So, Model object basically has no idea what Controller called it. How does it know what Controller to fire an event to And how do we know what Controller is expecting that notification br   nbsp nbspQ.3 The Controller calls the View, injecting it with the current Model object, so the View can use it to obtain the needed data. Is this correct or wrong If wrong, why is it wrong, and what is the proper way to do it br   nbsp nbspI have read my questions on MVC on here and other sites, viewed MVC diagrams, but I havent been able to really connect the dots the way its supposed to be connected. br   nbsp nbspThanks.p

Negative 386 pId like to create a codeCustomWindowcode class that behaves this way 1. Nonclient area of window is utilized too, TabControls tabs are present instead of window title like in Google Chrome. 2. Tabs are rightpadded so when window is too small, minmaxclose buttons dont collide with tabs  this should be doable in TabControl template. 3. There is a button after tabs much like a new tab button in Google Chrome. Again, this should be doable with custom implementation of TabControl and creating a fake child for rendering I guess. 4. My class inherits from Window class and every child in children collection is mapped to a TabControl tab like if TabControl.ItemsSource was bound to Window.Children. 5. Window exposes property ItemsSource that behaves like children collection too. 6. Window offers a way to style what TabControl recognizes as ItemTemplate. When I feed the window like codeCustomWindow.ItemsSource  new string[]  a, b, c code and I populate a template for items, three tabs will be created where tab header style is hardcoded in CustomWindow class and tab item content area is templated by user.p  pAs you can see this is basically a outline of Google Chrome window which is exactly what I am trying to accomplish. I know how to bend windows chrome the way I want with everything like system menu, doubleclick maximizing etc. handled. But I dont know how to make inherited class from Window that will force its only child to be a TabControl of my choice tabs headers are styled but in reality its child collection will be TabControls child collection. I am not as much experienced with WPF as Id like and I want to start this the right way so I dont need to rewrite it in future.p  pAdditionaly, when this is resolved, I want to give user the way to tell the tab its pinned, which I guess is best accomplished by defining an attached property in CustomWindow, something like CustomWindow.IsPinned for any child controlp  pThank you.p

I create the various dynamic XDocuments via one Very long statement using conditional operators for optional elements and attributes.p  pI now need to convert the XDocuments back to the class but as they are coming from different schemes many elements and sub elements may be optional.

Negative 386 pI am using a CFD code for computational fluid dynamic. I recently had the chance to see Intel Compiler using SSE in one of my loops, adding a nearly 2x factor to computation performances in this loop. However, the use of SSE and SIMD instructions seems more like luck. Most of the time, the compiler do nothing.p  pI am then trying to force the use of SSE, considering that AVX instructions will reinforce this aspect in the near future.p  pI made a simple 1D heat transfer code. It consist of two phases, using the results of the other U0  U1, then U1  U0, then U0  U1, etc. When it iterates, it converge to the stable solution. Most of my loops in the main code are using the same kind of calculation. Finite Difference.p  pHowever, my code is two times slower than the normal loop. Results are the sames, so calculations are consistent.p  pDid I make a mistake  I am using a Core 2 to test the loop, before testing on the super computer using Westmer.p  pHere is the code, with the SSE loop, and then the reference loop p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltemmintrin.hgt include lttime.hgt include ltvectorgt define n1 1004 define niter 200000  int i,j,t  double U0[n1] attribute aligned16 double U1[n1] attribute aligned16 double Dx,Dy,Lx,Ly,InvDxDx,Dt,alpha,totaltime,Stab,DtAlpha,DxDx  m128d vmmx00 m128d vmmx01 m128d vmmx02 m128d vmmx10  m128d va m128d vb m128d vc m128d vd  clockt time0,time1 FILE f1 int main    GENERAL      alpha  0.4    totaltime  1.0100.0    Dt  totaltimeniter11.0    Lx  1.0    Dx  Lxn111.0    InvDxDx  1.0DxDx    DxDx  DxDx    Stab  alphaDtInvDxDx    DtAlpha  Dtalpha  Stability if result lt 0.5     printfStability factor  f n,Stab      for i  0 i lt n1 iU0[i]  0.0    U0[1]  1.0    U0[2]  1.0    U0[3]  1.0    U0[n12]  2.0      for  i  0 i lt n1 i          for  j  i  1 j lt n2 j              stdswapU0[i][j], U0[j][i]                    va  mmset1pd2.0     vb  mmset1pdInvDxDx     vd  mmset1pdDtAlpha   time0clock   for t  0 t lt niter t        for i  2 i lt n12 i2            printfd  d  n,i,j       fflushstdout       vmmx00  mmloadpdampU0[i]       vmmx01  mmloadupdampU0[i1]       vmmx02  mmloadupdampU0[i1]        vmmx10  mmmulpdva,vmmx00    U1[i][j]  2.0U0[i][j]       vmmx10  mmaddpdvmmx10,vmmx01    U1[i][j]  U1[i][j]  U0[i1][j]       vmmx10  mmaddpdvmmx10,vmmx02    U1[i][j]  U1[i][j]  U0[i1][j]       vmmx10  mmmulpdvb,vmmx10    U1[i][j]  U1[i][j]  InvDxDx        vmmx10  mmmulpdvd,vmmx10    U1[i][j]  U1[i][j]  DtAlpha       vmmx10  mmaddpdvmmx10,vmmx00    U1[i][j]  U1[i][j]  U0[i][j]        mmstorepdampU1[i],vmmx10         U1[i][j]  U0[i][j]  DtAlpha U0[i1][j]2.0U0[i][j]U0[i1][j]InvDxDx           for i  2 i lt n12 i2            printfd  d  n,i,j       fflushstdout       vmmx00  mmloadpdampU1[i]       vmmx01  mmloadupdampU1[i1]       vmmx02  mmloadupdampU1[i1]        vmmx10  mmmulpdva,vmmx00    U0[i][j]  2.0U1[i][j]       vmmx10  mmaddpdvmmx10,vmmx01    U0[i][j]  U0[i][j]  U1[i1][j]       vmmx10  mmaddpdvmmx10,vmmx02    U0[i][j]  U0[i][j]  U1[i1][j]       vmmx10  mmmulpdvb,vmmx10    U0[i][j]  U0[i][j]  InvDxDx        vmmx10  mmmulpdvd,vmmx10    U0[i][j]  U0[i][j]  DtAlpha       vmmx10  mmaddpdvmmx10,vmmx00    U0[i][j]  U0[i][j]  U1[i][j]        mmstorepdampU0[i],vmmx10         U1[i][j]  U0[i][j]  DtAlpha U0[i1][j]2.0U0[i][j]U0[i1][j]InvDxDx           time1clock  printfLoop 0, total time  f n, double time1time0  f1  fopen out0.dat, wt  for i  1 i lt n11 i          fprintf f1, dtfn, i, U0[i]      REF     for i  0 i lt n1 iU0[i]  0.0    U0[1]  1.0    U0[2]  1.0    U0[3]  1.0    U0[n12]  2.0   time0clock   for t  0 t lt niter t        for i  2 i lt n12 i             U1[i]  U0[i]  DtAlpha U0[i1]2.0U0[i]U0[i1]InvDxDx           for i  2 i lt n12 i             U0[i]  U1[i]  DtAlpha U1[i1]2.0U1[i]U1[i1]InvDxDx           time1clock  printfLoop 0, total time  f n, double time1time0  f1  fopen outref.dat, wt  for i  1 i lt n11 i          fprintf f1, dtfn, i, U0[i]       codepre  pp  pstrongEdit strongp  pp  pConsidering your answers, I found the right place to discuss this, so I will enlarge the topic and explain my aims. If you accept, we will discuss about all of the loops one after an other. This can be long, but it could be extremely useful for a lot of people in my domain, and for OpenSource solvers like OpenFoam. Not considering the inpact on energy consumption we all use large supercalculators.p  pThe CFD code I am using takes more than 1 month running on 512 Westmer Cores. I am using MPI Message Passing Interface to communicate between procs. The Physic field can be considered as a mesh, so 1D, 2D or 3D arrays, depending of the type of simulations. But 3D are the best you can imagine.p  pThe full code is in Fortran 95, which is in fact a C simplified. It is easy to interface it with C, and C routines can be call directly from Fortran, types are the sames int, double, long, etc. But, Fortran does not allow such optimizations  it is designed to be simple. That is why I am investigating C instructions.p  pIn all CFD codes, we are facing the sames problems  3 types of loops, and MPI memory distribution. Lets first discuss about the loops p  ul lipSpatial derivatives called finite difference  The loop consist of a 1D convolution strongfor all casesstrong 1D, 2D, 3D, you derivate only on one axe at a time DF  F[i1]A  F[i]B  F[i1]C. However, when using more than 1D, the memory access become the following p  precode x1 derivative for i 1 gt n1     for j 1 gtn2         DFx1[i][j]  F[i1][j]A  F[i][j]B  F[i1][j]C   x2 derivative for i 1 gt n1     for j 1 gtn2         DFx2[i][j]  F[i][j1]D  F[i][j]E  F[i][j1]G codepre  pIn the first loop, memory access is not continue the invert in Fortran, memory is inverted. This is the first problem. Idem when using 3D arrays.pli lipPoisson equation resolution, i.e. matrix multiplication  The loop consist of a 1D, 2D or 3D convolution, strongdepending of the simulationstrong. This is in fact a second derivative DDF  DDF.p  precodefor i 1 gt n1     for j 1 gtn2         DDF[i][j]  F[i1][j]A  F[i][j]B  F[i1][j]C  F[i][j1]D  F[i][j]E  F[i][j1]G codepre  pThis loop is the same as the loop i first gave you, but it is computed directly, not even and odd.pli lipWeighted Gauss Seidel resolution, i.e. the same loop as bellow, but with dependency p  precode even for i 1 gt n1     for j 1 gtn2         F1[i][j]  F0[i1][j]A  F0[i][j]B  F0[i1][j]C  F0[i][j1]D  F0[i][j]E  F0[i][j1]G  odd for i 1 gt n1     for j 1 gtn2         F0[i][j]  F1[i1][j]A  F1[i][j]B  F1[i1][j]C  F1[i][j1]D  F1[i][j]E  F1[i][j1]G codepre  pThis is the loop you investigated before.pli ul  pThen, we face an other problem  memory distribution. Each core has its own memory, and need to share it with others. Lets consider the last loop, but simplified p  precode    for t 1 gt niter           even         for i 1 gt n12                 F1[i]  F0[i1]A  F0[i]B  F0[i1]C          odd         for i 1 gt n12                 F0[i]  F1[i1]A  F1[i]B  F1[i1]C codepre  pConsider that n1512, but this can not be stored in the local memory due to low RAM capacity. The memory is distributed on core0 1255 and core1 256512 that are NOT on the same computer, but on a network. In this case, the derivative in i256 need to be aware of the point i255, but this value is on the other proc. The memory containing the values of the other processors is called GHOST memory. So the loop is p  precode     update boundary memory      Share to ghost  core0  F0[255] gt Network gt F0[0]  core1 dont forget that for core1, the array restart from 0     Share to ghost  core1  F0[1] gt Network gt F0[256]  core0 you understand that F0[256] is the ghost for core0, and F0[0] is the ghost for core1      even, each core do this loop.     for i 1 gt n12             F1[i]  F0[i1]A  F0[i]B  F0[i1]C       update boundary memory      Share to ghost  core0  F1[255] gt Network gt F1[0]  core1     Share to ghost  core1  F1[1] gt Network gt F1[256]  core0      odd, each core do this loop.     for i 1 gt n12             F0[i]  F1[i1]A  F1[i]B  F1[i1]C codepre  pWe need to deal with this. strongMysticialstrong, you now see where i am going  the loop interlacing need to take this into account. I think this can be done this way p  precode         update boundary memory          Share to ghost  core0  F0[255] gt Network gt F0[0]  core1          Share to ghost  core1  F0[1] gt Network gt F0[256]  core0          for t 1 gt niter           compute borders in advance          core0 only  F1[255]  F0[254]A  F0[255]B  F0[256]C         core1 only  F1[1]  F0[0]A  F0[1]B  F0[2]C          Launch Share to ghost asynchronous  core0  F1[255] gt Network gt F1[0]  core1          Launch Share to ghost asynchronous  core1  F1[1] gt Network gt F1[256]  core0          During the same time this can be done at the same time because MPI support asynchronous communications          even         for i 2 gt n13 note the reduced domain                 F1[i]  F0[i1]A  F0[i]B  F0[i1]C          Check that communications are done.            compute borders in advance          core0 only  F0[255]  F1[254]A  F1[255]B  F1[256]C         core1 only  F0[1]  F1[0]A  F1[1]B  F1[2]C          Launch Share to ghost asynchronous  core0  F0[255] gt Network gt F0[0]  core1          Launch Share to ghost asynchronous  core1  F0[1] gt Network gt F0[256]  core0          odd, each core do this loop.         for i 2 gt n13                 F0[i]  F1[i1]A  F1[i]B  F1[i1]C          Check that communications are done. codepre  pHope I didnt make a mistake with indices somewhere.

Negative 386 pI am building a script that generates input data [parameters] for another program to calculate. I would like to optimize the resulting data. Previously I have been using the numpy powell optimization. The psuedo code looks something like this.p  precodedef valueparam      runprogramparam      Parse output      return value  scipy.optimize.fminpowellvalue,param  codepre  pThis works great however, it is incredibly slow as each iteration of the program can take days to run. What I would like to do is coarse grain parallelize this. So instead of running a single iteration at a time it would run number of parameters2 at a time. For examplep  precodeInitial guess param[1,2,3,4,5]  Modify guess by plus minus another matrix that is changeable at each iteration jump[1,1,1,1,1] Modify each variable plusminus jump. for num,a in enumerateparam     newparam1param[]     newparam1[num]newparam1[num]jump[num]     runprogramnewparam1     newparam2param[]     newparam2[num]newparam2[num]jump[num]     runprogramnewparam2  Wait until all programs are complete gt Parse Output Output[[value,param],...] Create new guess Repeat codepre  pNumber of variable can range from 312 so something such as this could potentially speed up the code from taking a year down to a week. All variables are dependent on each other and I am only looking for local minima from the initial guess. I have started an implementation using hessian matrices however, that is quite involved. Is there anything out there that either does this, is there a simpler way, or any suggestions to get startedp  pSo the primary question is the following Is there an algorithm that takes a starting guess, generates multiple guesses, then uses those multiple guesses to create a new guess, and repeats until a threshold is found. Only analytic derivatives are available. What is a good way of going about this, is there something built already that does this, is there other optionsp  pThank you for your time.p  pAs a small update I do have this working by calculating simple parabolas through the three points of each dimension and then using the minima as the next guess. This seems to work decently, but is not optimal. I am still looking for additional options.p  pCurrent best implementation is parallelizing the inner loop of powells method.p  pThank you everyone for your comments. Unfortunately it looks like there is simply not a concise answer to this particular problem. If I get around to implementing something that does this I will paste it here however, as the project is not particularly important or the need of results pressing I will likely be content letting it take up a node for awhile.p

Negative 386 pI was experiencing some performance issues when displaying a large number of images, I discovered the issue was that the full resolution image was being used when I really only needed an image less than 14 of the size. So I added a line in between BeginInit and EndInit to set the DecodePixelWidth to 200 which is the max width I will need in my layout. My performance was no longer an issue but some of the images are really small, definitely nowhere close to 200 pixels wide. Most of the images seemed to display correctly, and there doesnt seem to be any rhyme or reason to which are too small and which work correctly. I thought it might be due to differences in the original dimensions of the images but there was no pattern to the results. I tried bumping the width up to 600 which then allowed the offending images to display at the correct width of 200 but the performance then suffers.p  pAt this point I am not even sure where to start looking, and would be really grateful for a kick in the right direction.p  pEDIT Some more information below about the images and how I am using them.p  pMost of the images are around 1000X1500 although some have odd dimensions like 1000x1513. All of the images are JPEG. Currently each image is placed in a custom user control that I designed, nothing too fancy just a background around it with some text. Each user control is then placed in a grid, in its own rowcolumn. The grid is inside a scrollviewer so the user can scroll through the list. This might not be the best way to accomplish what I am looking for but its what I came up with quickly and it works for the most part. Id be happy to switch to another method of display if it would accomplish what i want in an easier or more concise way.p  pThe intended result is for a movie browsing app. There will be a scrollable list of movies, each represented as its own tile complete with title, movie poster, genre info, rating, and description. This list will be sortable on various items. The information about the movies is stored in a sql database on another machine. The images are originally stored on another machine but are copied locally to improve performance.p  pEDIT I have been able to solve the issue by not using DecodePixelWidth and instead saving a copy of the image at the desired size, this has improved performance. Youngjaes recommendation of not using DecodePixelWidth along with his mention of using a virtualized list led me to the following set of articles on creating a Virtualized Wrap Panel which should solve any other performance issues. The article is for silverlight but from what I understand silverlight is basically a watered down version of wpf, if it works in silverlight it should work in wpf. It shouldnt be too difficult to convert it for my use.p  pa hrefhttpblogs.claritycon.comblog200908custompanelsinsilverlightwpfpart1measureoverride relnofollowPart 1  MeasureOverrideap  pa hrefhttpblogs.claritycon.comblog200908custompanelsinsilverlightwpfpart2arrangeoverride relnofollowPart 2  ArrangeOverrideap  pa hrefhttpblogs.claritycon.comblog200908custompanelsinsilverlightwpfpart3animation relnofollowPart 3  Animationap  pa hrefhttpblogs.claritycon.comblog200909custompanelsinsilverlightwpfpart4virtualization relnofollowPart 4  Virtualizationap
Negative 386 pI am making a packet filtering program running on Ubuntu 12.04 which uses libipq as the library for copying packets into userspace. The logic of libipq works fine for me, my issue is that I have noticed a significant performance hit from using libipq to not using libipq. If I remove my iptable rules that I added for my program and let the kernel handle the packets, the speed is 50 MBs. However, when using libipq and having restored my iptables rule, the speed goes down to 1 MBs if im lucky, its usually half of that.p  pI wonder, could something be wrong with my iptable rules Could there be a more efficient use of rules, or is libipq simply that inefficient or my code even though I dont do that much Here is the script I use to setup my iptable rulesp  precodebinsh modprobe iptablefilter modprobe ipqueue iptables A FORWARD p icmp j QUEUE iptables A FORWARD p tcp j QUEUE iptables A FORWARD p udpj QUEUE iptables A INPUT p icmp j QUEUE iptables A INPUT p tcp j QUEUE iptables A INPUT p udp j QUEUE codepre  pOther than that, my iptable rules are the default set that came with Ubuntu.p  pNOTE My setup is for a client and server VM on two different subnets and using my Ubuntu VM to bridge both using NAT and ip masquerading.p

Negative 386 pIn a hrefhttpblog.bdoughan.com201012jaxbandmarshalunmarshalschema.html relnofollowthis fine posta i learned how to validate xml using moxy. The problem is that the validation comes at last and probably there are many failures due to invalid parameters given to some setter methods. Is there any way to validate each setter model based. So that if i set one value this value is validated against its constraints. at the time of each set call  the complete model may be invalidate as hell but i only want validation info about the current set call. In my case i want to throw IllegalargumentException if someone passes an illegal by xsd constraint parameter to one of the setters all setters are wrapped by an interface.p

Negative 386 pWhen a solution is programmatically opened in an addinextension VS2012 in my case using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudioenvdte.solution.open.aspx relnofollowSolution.Opena, the solution file is not added to the projects MRU i.e. FileRecent Projects and Solutions menu as it would be if you opened the solution using the FileOpenProjectSolution menu. Is there a way to force the file to be added Ive seen some references to manipulating the registry e.g. emHKCUSoftwareMicrosoftVisualStudio11.0ProjectMRUListem but is there another way that doesnt assume the storage that VS uses and therefore would be less likely to break in the future Perhaps a VS interface that might take care of it regardless of where the info might be stored. That would also allow me to ignore what the max  of mru items, avoiding errors in updatingrenumbering the existing items, etc. I found the strongIVsMRUItemsStorestrong but if that is what I should use Im unsure about what emcategoryGuidem I would be using. From what Ive seen it seems like this interface might be related to built in search functionality.p  p[strongEditstrong] Ok Ive done some more digging. First, IVsMRUItemsStore emseemsem unrelated to the project mru list since the Microsoft.VisualStudio.PlatformUI.MRUItemsStoreService seems to be empty even after showing the recent projects menu. Second, Ive tried directly manipulating the registry but that doesnt work out well because VS doesnt know about the registry change and so the menu and its internal cache remain unchanged. If you subsequently open another project or solution using the Open Project dialog, the registry gets overwritten with the cached information plus the projectsolution opened via the dialog. I would be ok with manipulating the registry if there was some way of notifying VS to reread the registry info without closing VS. I would also be happy if there were some other programmatic way of manipulating the recent projects list through VS object model.p  p[strongEdit2strong] Ive found that the View menu item in TFS Source Control Explorer does exactly what I want. It will open a given solution, prompting if the solution needs to be converted without closing the open documents and adds the item to the MRU. The question now is how do I do the same thing in my extensionaddin I cant use their command unless it takes a parameter because the solutionproject Im opening is not in TFS.p

Negative 386 pI made a slideshow using the slide template at HTML5Rocks, and modified it to include some interactive google charts.p  pUnfortunately, initially the HTML5 slide template hides all slides but the current, two following slides, and two preceeding slides this is in the css default for a slide code.slides gt article  display  none code. My interactive figures are slides i.e. codearticlecodes containing codeiframecodes with google charts inside. Unfortunately, slides that are first rendered codedisplaynonecode have some sort of bounding box issue with google charts when the slide is finally unhidden, the chart is compressed and does not have interactive effects. p  pI was able to work around this by starting the default slide i.e. not simply the current slide and its neighbors, but all slides with codedisplayblockcode. Then, when you change slides, I actively hide the noncurrent and nonneighboring ones. Now all charts render properly, but at the start of the presentation, it shows the final slide because all are drawn and it is drawn last.p  pI wanted to polish this around by adding an event that, after everything is loaded i.e. CPUintensive AJAX calls within an codeiframecode are finished running, the noncurrent and nonneighboring slides are hidden.p  pTo do this, I need to trigger a callback event strongafter everything is loaded and the browser is readystrong including AJAX calls within codeiframecodesp  pI tried the following, but it triggers too early, before the AJAX callbacks in my codeiframecodes have finished p  precodejQuerywindow.load function   some code to hide the noncurrent and nonneighboring slides    codepre  pSo the noncurrent and nonneighboring slides are hidden before the charts are drawn, and when those chart slides are unhidden, they are warped and ruined. I dont believe I can trigger my event with the AJAX calls, because they there are multiple from multiple slides that I want to finish.p  pSo thats the framing story. Heres what I want to know strongIs there an event that triggers after everything is loaded and the browser is completely readystrong  p  pThanks a lot for your help.p

Negative 386 pI have a high score table which currently uses facebook login to record the users high scores. p  pHowever I am aware that not everyone would want to use facebook just to store a high score, and in fact many people are immediately put off by facebook login.p  pSo my idea is to use their Google Play id on android devices, and their Game Center id on iOs devices.p  pMy problem is that I would ideally like a user to be able to unify their games across the 2 platforms. This is the only reason I plan to keep facebook login in the game, as the ID number from that is not dependent on the platform.p  pE.g.  User plays on their iPhone, I retrieve their GC id and use that to populate a profileid primary key in the mysql table.  They then log in using facebook. Would it be best to create a new row with the facebook ID as the profileid, and then put the previous profileid into an appleid column This way, if they then log in on an Android phone using facebook, I can retrieve the game data from their iOS session.p  pIt seems to me like there is probably a fairly simple solution to this, but Im stuck in one of those loops where you think about doing it one way and then realize youve already tried that before. p  pDoes anyone have any good ideas on how they would do thisp  pEdit I should add that one of the areas Im getting a brainfreeze thinking about is this. Lets say I have a facebook id and an apple id stored for the user. If the next time they update the score they are not logged into facebook and so only the apple id is sent as part of the query, how can I make sure I dont replace the facebook id field with null or p  pI could do p  precodeif facebookID   ampamp facebookID  NULL  sql  UPDATE scores SET facebookid  facebookID WHERE profileid  profileid    if appleID   ampamp appleID  NULL  sql  UPDATE scores SET appleid  appleID WHERE profileid  profileid    if googleID   ampamp googleID  NULL  sql  UPDATE scores SET googleid  googleID WHERE profileid  profileid   codepre  pBut that seems like its not very efficient. Is there a way to only update a field if the variable is not nullblankp

Negative 386 pIs there a way to bdebugb why I get brbr b lstatpathtofile, 0x...  1 EACCES permission denied b brbr error when accessing a filedirectory to pinpoint whether it is because of selinux issues or because of usergroup permission or NFS or any ACLs that might be coming into playp  pI was having the correct permissions set on a directory for a user and I was able to create a file in that directory after logging in as the user. However when PHP is running under the Apache scope with the same user and group, it fails to create the file. p  pI understand Apache is using suid to change from root to the required user but still when PHP executes under Apache, the file is not created. Also, PHP prints out correct and expected real and effective user IDs instead of root.p  pFor those interested, the pathtofile is on an NFSv4 mount, but I would like to pinpoint, due to what reasons, the permission is being denied.p  pWould it be possible to knowp

Negative 386 pSo far I did not find how to get StaticLayout to restrict text drawing to one line only.br The StaticLayout class does have a lot of methods to deal with ellipsis, but my guess is that ellipsis will appear only if the whole canvas is filled with text and there is still not enough space to display the whole text.br strongNotestrong I dont want to resize the text to fit, I want to keep my chosen text size and just have it clipped if it is too long.p

Negative 386 pIm looking for some guidance on Architecture for an app Im building in Backbone.p  pIts basically a multipage App that calculates data based on an initial dataset. The Initial dataset is country specific and is getting pulled in from a JSON file.p  pWhen the app fires up, the dataset is used as the defaults in my main Backbone.Model. These defaults then have to be processedcalculated and set as additional model attributes. These attribute represent my app state. Some can be overridden from the UI. So to recap, Im using a singleton Backbone.Model to store the initial data, Im then building the rest of the data up on the Models initialize method.p  pI then recalculate the dataset attributes on model.change event. This fires the models custom method updateAttributes which recalculates data. It seems to me like its pretty inefficient because Im calculating the attributes, first in the initialize method, and again in the updateAttributes method.p  pAfter the values are all processed the data set is complete and can be applied to the app templates. The tricky part now is that some of the calculated data in the set are now editable from the UI. Once these default attributes are edited from the UI I dont want the updateAttributes method to recalculate their values because they are no longer default data, they are now userDefined data.p  pIm not quite sure where to go from this point, Im thinking of setting some attributes on the rapidly expanding model such as attributeNameSetFromUI true, and then having some if statements in the updateAttributes method that check for these and skip over that part of the calculation if the default isnt necessary.p  pIm not even sure if a large singleton Model is the way to go, it seems to work well enough.p  pIf anyone has some tips for this scenario that would be awesome. Im new to Backbone, finding it quite challengingp

Negative 386 pIm using a script that should pull right at 1400 records from our LDAP  i double checked by running the same filter in Apache Directory Studio and the query ran successfully.  The output will be used as a SSIS SQL source.  I know our page limit on the LDAP is set at 2000 however every time we run the script below we get the following error message The size limit was exceeded.  Can anyone see what can be modified in our script to overcome this error message  Ive tried setting request.SizeLimit  Integer.MaxValue and have tried  request.SizeLimit  2000 just after however the same error message of The size limit was exceeded persists.

Negative 386 pSo basically I started programming a website responsively using media queries at my clients request, when surprisingly my client tells me that the website must be responsive in IE7 So I developed a jQuery plugin that allows you to plugin your break points then appends a class or id to the body signifying which device is being used.

Negative 386 pI want to be able to connect to multiple, identical devices, so that my program acts as a controller over all these devices. Ive written a program that allows me to connect to a device via RS232. I run it using java  1.7 with Java Comms on a Windows Vista laptop. I use a USB to RS232 adapter from Startech type ICUSB2324X which allows me to have 4 aditional COM portsRS232 connections. The program works perfectly when I connect only 1 device at a time.

Ive tried things like code[[09.,[]]]code but none have worked. Im working in Java on Android.p  pCan anyone help me please This is the last thing preventing from making a big git commit.p  pMore details the matrices will be any size, like code[[1,2,3,4][5,6,7,8][9,10,1,12]]code. I want a regex that will put out the whole matrix not individual parts, because itll be surrounded by things like functions, operators, etc. Numbers in the matrix will be either integer or double. Scientific notation is possible too. Hexother bases are not.p  pResolution the reason code[.]code wasnt working was because Javas String.matches didnt work the way I thought it did, and because I was using it in combination with another regex that worked fine itself. Apparently codecode means something in regex.p

User 2 can only read it when this date and time are smaller than the current date and time codeWHERE addTime lt NOWcode.pli lipInsert the message from User 1 in a messageQueue table. This is a table that contains all the messages that needs to be placed in the future. A cronjob which will run every minute or so will place all the messages with a date and time smaller than the current time into the message table and deletes it from the messageQueue table. An email can be send directly to User 2.pli ol  pConsp  ol liMethod 1 no way to send a notification email to User 2li liMethod 2 you will have to set a cronjob that runs every minute a message can be placed in the future with a precision of one minute. The notification email can be send directly, but it will be a heavy system with a lot of messages. If the cronjob takes longer than a minute it will be overlapping each other, which can result in a server shutdown eventually.li ol  pDoes anyone have any idea to do this Im actually looking for some push function from the serverdatabase, which tells my script that a new message is delivered to User 2 and that an email needs to be send to User 2.p

Negative 386 pI am using node.js, and my server only has one port open for me to use node.js on. And no, I cannot open more ports. Because I am using this same server for testing and production and it seems like it would be more convenient, I want to be able to have node.js pages, like in php. Basically, if the url is something, I want the code in one node.js file to be executed. If the url is something else, I want a different node.js script to be run. I want it so that if one page crashes, the rest of the website stays up. I think there might be a way to do this with express, but Im not sure and I dont know how to do it.p

When I click on the gridview header, I will use ModalPopupExtender from ajax to populate the hidden panel and show a checkboxlist for users to chose and then save.p  pThe problem that Im having is, the selected item from checkboxlist cannot be cleared. For example, I selected first item and click save. After that ModalPopupExtender will be closed. If I click on the gridview header again, when the checkboxlist is populated, the previous selected first item clearly showed that it wasnt selected. Then I select second item from the checkboxlist to save, but this time the system will detect that the first item still selected.

Negative 386 pI have some Ruby code I am attempting to refactor using Scala. Ill put an example of the code below, but the dynamic nature of Ruby makes this trivial to write also helps that Im better versed in Ruby than Scala. Heres the code in Rubyp  pI have a bunch of constants defined like the followingp  precodeREGWEEK1START         Date.parse20130905 REGWEEK1END           Date.parse20130909 REGWEEK2START         Date.parse20130912   REGWEEK2END           Date.parse20130916 REGWEEK3START         Date.parse20130919   REGWEEK3END           Date.parse20130923 codepre  pThen, in order to figure out if Im in a certain week and you cant use a continuous function here, because weeks can be anywhere from 1 to 7 days later on in the real world example, I use this trivial loopp  precodedef getweek   date  Date.now   for i in 1..17     return i if date gt constgetREGWEEKiSTART ampamp date lt constgetREGWEEKiEND   end    return 0 end codepre  pDoing this in Ruby proved trivial because you can call a constant by name dynamically using the codeconstgetcode method.  Now, I began this example in Scala, and Im guessing the right answer will be to somehow Map or use Enums, but Im not sure how to piece it together, but clearly something like this will not workp  precode def getCurrentWeek Int       val REGWEEK1START  MyDateTimeHelper.parseDate20130905         val REGWEEK1END  MyDateTimeHelper.parseDate20130909         val REGWEEK2START  MyDateTimeHelper.parseDate20130912         val REGWEEK2END  MyDateTimeHelper.parseDate20130916       .... more DATES ...    codepre  pHow to loop here is where Im stuck in Scala. Or if I should even be looping at all here as Im not familiar with Scala data structures, so there might be a more optimal way of solving this. Anyone with more Scala experience have a solution for how to figure out if the current date falls between each of those START and END values, that would be ideal. p

Negative 386 pI am a little new to all these so please bear with me if the question sounds a little dumb. I am doing a project on comparing the extends on using GPU for map visualization and spatial analysis on mobile devices Android, basically. I have decided to leverage upon the JTS topology suite which offers a variety of analysis Triangulation, point in polygon and the like and have implemented these functions in Android without the use of GPU mainly running it on CPU. p  pHowever, I would like to bring these functions onto the GPU through RenderScript, but have been unable to reference the different variables in RenderScript. These are types such as GeometryFactory, Point, Polygon, Coordinates which I want to use in the RenderScript C file. p  pHence, should I download the C library version of JTS GEOS, basically and use it in RenderScript And if so, how should I go about to implement it I am not exactly competent in C Or is there a way to set the different variables in the RenderScript C file via Java p  pShould you require any details  I am using Android Developer Tools with Eclipse, JTS 1.13p  pThank youp  pAs an example, I would like to do something like in Java p  blockquote   pimport jtslibrary.p blockquote  pbut implement it in RenderScript so that it can recognize the variable type.p

Negative 386 pVisual Studio 2013 introduced a new feature, Code Lens, where it shows you how many times each of your methods are calledreferenced, how many unit tests cover the method, and how many are passing.

So an event can have certain files available to anonymous users and others available only to our members.p  pWere using the ImageField Extended Fields module to add fields to file uploads and have a checkbox called Make Public along with Description and Sort Order which Im hoping can be used to order the files for display on the page... but thats not a priority.

Negative 386 pI am trying to create a small application that is able to manage errors and send bug reports etc. I am hoping this can be in the form of a button so when the button is pressed, it causes the whole application to crash.p  pI know immediately that most users are reaching for the down arrow button to flag this as a stupid question. However I only wish to make my application crash so that I can see if my application can send bug reports if it does crash therefore helping me develop the program better.p  pThere must be a way of making the application crash and despite a sizeable search on the Internet, I have not been able to find anything. And when I mean crash I mean it stops responding and hopefully brings up the dialogue box looking for a solution.p  pI want to crash my application deliberately to try and develop a way to catch any exceptions and then send them in a bug report on next load up.p  pI dont have anything to give you because I cannot find anything myself and thats why Im here... To ask how do I crash it someone must know. It can be as simple or as complicated as you want. A nice big crash would be very nice though.p
Negative 386 pIm using CoreGraphics to draw a graph from data from two codeNSArraycode objects one array containing the horizontal data, one containing the vertical data. While this works okay, Id like to implement a zoom feature so that when a user pinches on the graph, the viewable data zooms according to their pinch.p  pSo that a pinch out like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPmGyO.png altenter image description herep  pBecomes this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrHV45.png altenter image description herep  pIve already got a variable called codedataRangecode, which when the graph is rendered, it is restricted to this range of values. codedataRangecode is an codeNSRangecode, meaning it is specified by a start position and a length. However, Im unsure how to calculate these values as the user is pinching out to produce the zooming effect.p  pAfter thinking about how I could achieve this, I came up with the followingp  ol lipDetermine each fingers location on the screen, and figure out a what elements in the array I would need to zoom intopli lipAs the position moves closer and closer towards the sides of the graph, set the range of the visible data accordinglypli ol  pHowever, there have been a few issues with that method. Firstly, it ignores whether or not the graph has been zoomed in previously, meaning that users are unable to zoom in more than once. It also does the opposite than what you would expect, as pinching in increases the range of the visible data zooms out, and pinching out means decreases the range of the visible data zooms in. Id like the opposite of this.p  pThe code which does this is implemented inside codetouchesMovedwithEventcodep  precode voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      NSSet allTouches  [event allTouches]      if [allTouches count]  2          CGFloat xPositionStart  0.0f, xPositionEnd  0.0f         CGFloat touchPositions[2]  0.0f, 0.0f          for UITouch object in allTouches              CGPoint touchLocation  [object locationInViewself]              if touchPositions[0]  0.0f                  touchPositions[0]  touchLocation.x              else                  touchPositions[1]  touchLocation.x                                if touchPositions[0] gt touchPositions[1]              xPositionEnd  touchPositions[0]             xPositionStart  touchPositions[1]          else              xPositionStart  touchPositions[0]             xPositionEnd  touchPositions[1]                   CGFloat xPositionStartActual  xPositionStart  self.frame.size.width  [self.horizontalValues count]         CGFloat xPositionEndActual  xPositionEnd  self.frame.size.width  [self.horizontalValues count]          self.dataRange  NSMakeRangexPositionStartActual, xPositionEndActual  xPositionStartActual         [self setNeedsDisplay]       codepre  pIm kind of stuck as I am unable to find a way to resolve these issues with my current method.

Negative 386 pIm writing python app which currently is being hosted on Heroku. It is in early development stage, so Im using free account with one web dyno. Still, I want my heavier tasks to be done asynchronously so Im using iron worker addon. I have it all set up and it does the simplest jobs like sending emails or anything that doesnt require any data being sent back to the application. The question is How do I send the worker output back to my application from the iron worker Or even better, how do I notify my app that the worker is done with the jobp  pI looked at other iron solutions like cache and message queue, but the only thing I can find is that I can explicitly ask for the worker state. Obviously I dont want my web service to poll the worker because it kind of defeats the original purpose of moving the tasks to background. What am I missing herep

Negative 386 pId like to define elegant interfaces for a binary relation and for a transitive relation. I consider a binary relation as a set of pairs, a subset of some set X  Y. In fact I intend to work mainly with transitive relations, but I occasionally need general binary relations. This is mainly for my own usage but I may endup publishing this as a FLOSS library for other users. I would like my definitions to make sense on a general level as I do not have yet precise requirements about usage of these classes I need them for experimental work related to scientific research, I have some ideas right now but it is unclear yet what kind of experiments I will need as more ideas come while doing the research.p  h2General ideah2  pThe core of what I think I need is as follows.p  precode   param ltFgt              the type used for the from elements.   param ltTgt              the type used for the to elements.      public interface BinaryRelationTentativeltF, Tgt             return a view of the domain of this relation all the elements x such that for some y, x, y is in the               relation.           public SetltFgt getFromSet             return a view of the range of this relation all the elements y such that for some x, x, y is in the relation.           public SetltTgt getToSet             return the number of pairs that this relation contains.           public int size             return ltcodegttrueltcodegt iff the relation has empty from and to sets.           public boolean isEmpty             A binary relation equals an other one iff they have equal from and to sets and for each x, y contained in one,       x, y is contained in the other one.           Override     public boolean equalsObject obj             return whether the given ltcodegtfromltcodegt element is in relation with the ltcodegttoltcodegt element.           public boolean containsF from, T to             Optional operation.           public boolean addF from, T to  codepre  pThis is only the core features, so that you see what I mean  nicer features for traversal and so on would be welcome, see below. Then I would define a codeTransitiveRelationltEgtcode that extends codeBinaryRelationltE, Egtcode, that does not implement codeaddcode but rather provides codeaddTransitiveF from, T tocode.p  h2Reusing classical collectionsh2  pNow of course, I want to reuse classical collection interfaces as much as possible. It seems Guavas codeSetMultimapcode a hrefhttpdocs.guavalibraries.googlecode.comgitjavadoccomgooglecommoncollectSetMultimap.html relnofollowjavadoca, a hrefhttpcode.google.compguavalibrarieswikiNewCollectionTypesExplainedMultimap relnofollowuser guidea has the core features I need and more. The user guide even mentions the use case of an unlabeled directed graph. One problem I see with using directly codeSetMultimapcode is that the terminology is not exactly right speaking of keys and values in case of a binary relation is strange. Moreover, it misses something. There is an asymetry that makes sense in a SetMultimap designed to go from key to values, that makes less sense in a binary relation. The SetMultimap has an interface and implementations that allows one to, given a from element, iterate efficiently i.e. without traversing the whole relation through the to elements in relation to it. Similarly, I would like to be able to, having a to element, iterate over the corresponding from elements efficiently. So I need something that could be called a BiSetMultimap corresponding to both a codeMapltK, SetltVgtgtcode and a codeMapltV, SetltKgtgtcode. I have not been able to find such thing in the Java world.p  pI am currently, thus, thinking about defining codeBinaryRelationltF, Tgtcode as a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFacadepattern relnofollowfacadea to codeSetMultimapltF, Tgtcode. I can then create betternamed methods in the interface conceptually equivalent to the methods in codeSetMultimapcode, and I can add a method codegetInverselyRelatedT to SetltFgtcode that gives the from elements. I could provide implementations based on two codeSetMultimapcodes kept in sync, one representing the relation and one representing its inverse.p  pTheres numerous alternative approaches to this problem. I could for example define codeBinaryRelationcode as extending codeSetMultimapcode. Or I could avoid hiding completely codeSetMultimapcode and provide access to it through codeBinaryRelationasSetMultimapcode. That way I get all their nice method interfaces. Or I could give up entirely the idea of a specific interface and use a codeSetMultimapcode instead of a codeBinaryRelationcode, considering then the reversetraversal operation as an optimisation feature available in specific classes but not on the interface level. Or I could perhaps use something else than SetMultimap as a basis for the design.p  pTherefore, my question finally what do you think about my approach Can you think about other approaches Some problems I overlooked An existing solution I could usep  h2Possible linksh2  pI thought about using some Graph library a hrefhttpjung.sourceforge.net relnofollowJUNGa, a hrefhttpsgithub.comjgraphtjgrapht relnofollowJGraphTa, a hrefhttpsgithub.comtinkerpopblueprintswiki relnofollowBlueprinta, but I do not think they fit my needs. All these have an codeEdgecode class or an Edge type parameter which adds complexity and none provide interfaces and implementations as nice as codeSetMultimapcode, in my humble opinion. a hrefhttpwww.i3s.unice.frhogiegrph relnofollowGrpha does not provide objects for vertices, as the a hrefhttpwww.i3s.unice.frhogiegrphpageDocumentation relnofollowuser manuala says. I may have missed something though so tell me if you disagree.p  pEdit. As mentioned by Xaerxess, this guava a hrefhttpscode.google.compguavalibrariesissuesdetailid394 relnofollowissuea suggests to add what I call here a BiSetMultimap to Guava.p

Negative 386 pSo I am measuring some latencies for how long it takes it execute an add instruction on my machine to get an estimate of CPI. I first wrote a linear version that implemented a serial add interleaved to take advantage of pipeline. I then took the same code and wrapped the additions in a loop and reevaluated it. I understand the effects of loop level parallelism but I dont get how it would be faster than the serial version which should still implement DLP. I thought maybe it was because the loop unrolling version is taking more advantage of the pipeline through register renaming so there is a higher IPC but I also tried increasing the interleaving of the linear version and it didnt really increase the performance. I would think that branch mispredictions would cause the looped version to be quite a bit slower but thats not the case. Any thoughtsp  precodeinclude lttime.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  define ONE asm volatile add 20, eax add 10, ecx define FIVE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE define TWOFIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE define HUNDO TWOFIVE TWOFIVE TWOFIVE TWOFIVE define THOUSAND  HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO define TENTHOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND define HUNDREDK  TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND define MILLION  HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK  static inline unsigned long long rdtscvoid     unsigned end, start     asm volatilerdtsc  astart, dend     return unsigned long longstart  unsigned long longendltlt32  int main     double CPI  0     long long start, end     long long clocks     int i     startrdtsc     fori0 i lt 10000 i         HUNDREDK          endrdtsc     calculate the time elapsed in ns per access     clocks  endstart     CPI  clocksdouble20000010000 divide by Number of instructions  loop      printfCycles Per Instruction lf, Clocks Ldn, CPI, clocks  codepre  pThe difference between the two is pretty significant. The linear version has a IPC of about .2 and the looped version has an IPC of about 4. And yes I remembered to change the amount of instructions I was dividing by when evaluating the two p  pMaybe there is some confusion about the way I am doing this because file size is not the issue. I am simply removing the loop. The two process a different amount of instructions, but I also change the value I am dividing by at the end. The end with the same compiled size.p  pUPDATE Thanks for the responses. There were a couple issues. The first being the way I was doing my measurements the IF time for one version was being amortized across the loop while the other wasnt. I ran some more code and interleaving of instructions from the Loop Level parallelism was greater in loop than in the serial version. The serial version still has some Write after Write dependencies that are not being renamed and are causing stalls to the pipeline.p

Negative 386 pGuys I am trying to make a simple ticket generation system for my company as a favor. For now, I have a table called codetblTicketcode and another table called codetblEngineercode in my MSSQL database. p  pMy application is in C windows forms, so on the new ticket generation form, I have many textboxes and a comboBox for assigning engineer which is being populated by codetblEngineercode. Upon ticket generation, all the information entered in this form is stored in codetblTicketcode along with codeEngineerIDcode from codetblEngineercode.p  pIt was working great but then my client asked me to add option so that 3 engineers could be assigned on a single ticket. p  pIn the future, I will have to develop a engineer module in which engineer will be able to see tickets assigned to him only. It will include a login system for authentication purpose. So if a new ticket is generated and is assigned to 3 engineers, only that 3 engineers should be able to see the ticket and not the others.p  pHow should I go about this approach  It was really easy if there was only one engineer. Now do I need to make a manytomany table like codetblAssignedEngcode with ticket id and multiple engineer ids referenced as a foreign key I havent much experience with SQL so I am kinda struggling here and any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 386 pI have an interesting issues and wanted some input from someone with a similar experience.  I have an Android app that makes a REST call e.g. accepts an open order. App sends out the request and runs into connectivity issues, meanwhile server gets the request, changes order state and sends back a response e.g. HTTP 200. But, the app, missing its network connection, does not receive the response and gets an timeout exception. If I try to accept the order again, I get response that it is already taken in this case by me.p  pThe question would be  what should be the best approach to such situation.  For now, the requirements are to run a loop if I get a timeout exception in some scenarios its a loop including another web call to check whether this order did not appear in my CurrentOrders. I dont like this design and was wondering what would be better.

Negative 386 pMy virtual machine of 64bit Debian 7.5 wheezy was working in VirtualBox 4.3.12r93733 on a Windows 8.1 Pro 64bit Operating System, x64based processor IntelR XeonR CPU E51620 v2  3.70GHz  3.69 GHz machine Dell Precision T3610 yesterday.

Negative 386 pI have an application that supports plugins.  These plugins are sets of DLLs that are loaded into independent application domains.  My primary application looks for classes in these domains via Ninject.Extensions.Conventions that inherit from an codeIPlugincodeand binds each of these to their concrete plugin implementations in the following fashionp  precodevar kernel  new StandardKernel kernel.Bindscanner gt scanner.FrompluginAssemblies.SelectAllClasses       .InheritedFromltIPlugingt.BindWithltCustomBindingGeneratorltIPlugingtgt  CustomBindingGenerator public class CustomBindingGeneratorltTInterfacegt  IBindingGenerator      public static readonly string MetadataKey  PluginKey      public IEnumerableltIBindingWhenInNamedWithOrOnSyntaxltobjectgtgt CreateBindingsType type, IBindingRoot bindingRoot              Type interfaceType  typeofTInterface         if interfaceType.IsAssignableFromtype             yield return null         yield return IBindingWhenInNamedWithOrOnSyntaxltobjectgtbindingRoot.BindinterfaceType.Totype.WithMetadataMetadataKey, type.FullName       codepre  pThis all works fine  plugins are loaded and then can be spun up and executed as needed.  My problem started when I tried to provide dependency injection features to the plugins themselves, so that plugins could use constructor injection for their specific application dependencies.  I had each plugin define a codeIDependencySpecificationcode that is passed a reference to same kernel that holds the bindings for all the plugins within the assemblies i.e., the same codekernelcode from abovep  precodepublic class MyPluginDependencySpecification  IDependencySpecification      public void SetupDependenciesIKernel kernel               kernel.BindltIMyServicegt.ToltMyServicegt          ....       codepre  pThis works great  as long as the version of Ninject that the primary application is using is the same as the version of Ninject that the plugin is using.  Some newer plugins are starting to rely on libraries that require a newer version of Ninject, and when trying to load this codeIDependencySpecificationcode, my main application throws an error saying it doesnt implement the codeSetupDependenciescode method.  p  pIn summary, even though Ive tried to isolate my plugins from my application in almost every way via app domains, etc., this Ninject reference is leaking through by necessity and is now starting to cause version conflict errors.  strongIs there a way I can restructure this architecture to avoid this problem and still enable my plugins to specify their own dependency injection bindingsstrongp

Negative 386 pIn iOS 8, Apple has given developers the ability to create custom keyboards. In the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualExtensibilityPGKeyboard.htmldocumentationa, Apple states that you should create a new keyboard if you want to support a language that iOS does not currently support. Therefore, if you are able to support new languages, are you able to create a keyboard that contains new emoji characters I would assume that by Apple stating that you can support a new language, they would expect there to be custom characters involved. If including custom characters is possible, how would other devices even if only other devices running iOS 8 display the new charactersp

Negative 386 pIm fairly new to the raspberry pi.p  pThe essence of my problem is as followsp  pI have a GPIO pin change that must be monitoredcontinuously polled to see if it changes. If it changes, I must load a new QML file in my Qt5 project using a Loader. I know how to do the loader part, considering its fairly simple. I need a way to poll the GPIO pin and to be notified of a change.p  pIve read that the QSocketNotifier class maybe helpful. But Im frankly clueless as to how to do this.p  pAny help provided towards figuring out how to do this is appreciated. Thank you p  pEDIT Im building a sort of a Main Menu to select different options on a GUI for a raspberry pi based system, running on Debian. Its roughly like a set top box. In equivalence to the GUI based buttons on screen, It should be able to acquire a hardware based interrupt from external buttons that are connected to the GPIO pins that causes a new page to loada new activity to begin.p  pIf I understand correctly, the c part of the code must capture this pin change, and relay it to the QML part. I need to be able to do this.p

Negative 386 pIm familiar with text wrapping, however I was wondering if there was a way to prevent text from wrapping. If you have a long print statement, when it reaches the end of the line it automatically wraps around and starts a new line. Is there a way I can force it to print the entire statement to one line even if it doesnt all fit I would rather the text cut off when it reaches the end of the window rather than it wrapping to the next line.p  pMore precisely Im trying to list the contents of a directory on one line, and only one line, because the next line will list the contents of a different directory. Its only meant to give a preview of what a directory contains so I dont care if the program doesnt output all the contents if they cant all fit on one line. However, I want it to take advantage of as much horizontal space as its given. Rather than making the code factor in the width of the windoweven if the user resizes it and the length of each filename to determine how many filenames it can fit in a single line. I was curious if it would just be easier and more efficient to just cut the text off at the end of the line, especially since none of the directories are going to have more than 15 files and are often less but sometimes the contents cant all fit on one line. Heres a rough example of what Im tryingp  precodeimport os while 1     wd  inputInput full path for directory      try         os.listdirwd     except         printinvalid input...         continue     break list  os.listdirwd printwd,  , end  try     printos.listdirwd  THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO FORCE THE OUTPUT TO A SINGLE LINE except     print codepre

Negative 386 pI am asking this here because I really dont know how I should Google this. I need a confirmation of something that I probably figured out today. Some days ago I thought that if an object inherits a method of its father it means that it basically has the method in its code. But then I asked what if we do thisp  precodeclass B extends A     public B        public int getValue       return 2  super.getValue       class C extends B     public C        public int getValueint b       return 5  b     codepre  pAnd lets say there is a class A that has the codegetValuecode method too. Now an object of class C uses its codegetValuecode method without parameter that it has inherited from B. p  pBut codesuper.getValuecode still refers to class A, even though the method calling it was inherited.p  pInheritance does not mean that class C has the method in its code, but that it can use it from B, right codesupercode still refers to the superclass of its original class.p  pIs that insight correctp

When I switch the connection over to this pin, it does nothing.  From what I know currently which would appear to be incorrect, this pin should read high when connected to another pin that is outputting a high signal in this case D6, which I know is working since I can use that in the pushbutton circuit when it is connected to ground.  Instead, it would appear that the value of this pin in the register it is connected to is always 1 the do stuff part of the if else statement is always running.  p  pAny help on what Im getting wrong would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 386 pI am trying and failing to implement a loaded function for a dynamically loaded image. I have the html element in the html markup first. I then have a timer that starts to fire on the jquery document ready function.  Each time the timer fires ticks, i set the source on the html image element, and i want to know when it loads.  If it loaded correctly, i want to stop the timer.  if it didnt load correct, do nothing.  p  pMy main attempt focused on checking the natural width and height of the image node after i had set the source.  but since the code probably ran faster than the load of the image, checking the natural widht and height right after the source setting resulted in values of 0 and 0.p  pShould i just add a time delay between setting the image source and checking the natural widthheight Is that the correct solutionp  pHere is what i have.  Notice that the loaded event never fires, but every 2 seconds i get the messages HERE and HERE2p  precodeltheadgt ... ltscriptgt var timer  document.readyfunction       timer  setIntervalfunction   tick , 2000   function tick         alerthere     loginTestImage.onload, function               never gets here         alertloaded image         window.clearIntervaltimer          alerthere2      loginTestImage.attrsrc, httpsasdasd.sds.comasdpimagesasdasd.png  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltimg idloginTestImagegt ltbodygt codepre

Negative 386 pI seriously do not know what i am missing in the below code. Wha t I am trying to do is, to have some codenetworkcode and codeWiFicode info displayed according to the current connectivity and to the codeWiFicode current state. For an example, if the App is running and the user decided to turn the codeWiFicode OFF, then, some text should be displayed automatically to show the current codeBSSID00.00.00.00code, codespeed 1Mbpscode codeRSSI0code and etc. And if the user decided to turn the codeWiFicode ON, then, the same previously mentione info should displays its correspnding values.p  pTo achieve this, I have created a codebroadCastReceivercode for the codeWiFicode as mentioned below in the code and I register this codebroadCastReceivercode in codeonStartcode, and unregister it in codeonStopcode.p  pWhat happens is, p  pstrongCase1strongp  pif initially the codeWiFicode is turned ON and I run the App, then every thing is fine and the App displays something as in the codepic0code below. But, at this state if i pressed the codedisconnectcode codetoggle buttoncode and pressed on it again to codereconnectcode, then the App displays something like as in codepic1code below and does not display the info.p  pstrongCase2strongp  pif initially the codeWiFicode is turned OFF and I run the App, then I get something as in codepic2code, and this is normal because there is not connection yet. But, in this case after pressing the codeconnectcode codetoggle buttoncode, i get something as in codepic3code, and dispite there is a connection, however, no info are displayed.p  pAbove that, when I run the App, and try to connect to a network manually and go back to the App, it crashes and codelogcatcode says codeunable to unregister an unregistered receivercodep  pKinly please let me know what I am missing and what I did wrong.p  pstrongemCodeemstrongp  precodepublic class WiFiSocket04 extends Activity   TextView tvconnstatus TextView tvwifistate TextView tvconnbssid TextView tvconnspeed

Negative 386 pI use an external library which operates on large quantities of data. The data is passed in by a raw pointer, plus the length. The library does not claim ownership of the pointer, but invokes a provided callback function with the same two arguments when it is done with the data.p  pThe data gets prepared conveniently by using codestdvectorltTgtcode, and Id rather not give up this convenience. Copying the data is completely out of the question. Thus, I need a way to take over the memory buffer owned by an codestdvectorltTgtcode, and later on deallocate it in the callback.p  pMy current solution looks as followsp  precodestdvectorltTgt input  prepareinput T  data  input.data sizet size  input.size  move the vector to raw storage, to prevent deallocation alignasstdvectorltTgt char temp[sizeofstdvectorltTgt] new temp stdvectorltTgtstdmoveinput  invoke the library libstartProcesingdata, size codepre  pand, in the callback functionp  precodevoid callbackT  data, sizet size      stdallocatorltTgt.deallocatedata, size  codepre  pThis solution works, because the standard allocators codedeallocatecode function ignores its second argument the element count and simply calls codeoperator deletedatacode. If it did not, bad things could happen, as the codesizecode of the input vector might be quite a bit smaller than its codecapacitycode.p  pMy question is is there a reliable wrt. the C standard way of taking over the buffer of codestdvectorcode and releasing it manually at some later timep

Negative 386 pWell I am completely unaware about his , my requirement goes like this , we develop JUNIT test cases in a legacy application using MOCKITO and EJBMock , basic structure of the application is a Controller methods in test which takes POJO as argument , now in order to test this method we get input set of valuesPOJO for that method in test from excel , everything works very well , problem is creating input set of values for those POJO , they can have huge set of data inside , it literary takes hours to put a scenarios input set into excel by putting break point in that method call , then copy pasting those values inside excel. p  pI am looking for some tool or peace of code , which I can put just after the method in test , and it will read the object which came as argument and output it on a excel , considering POJO may have more POJO inside it , in that case it should simply create another sheet in that excel. it should also do reverse i.e , reading the excel to create that object.p  pIf this happens developer will be able to write test cases in 5 mins instead of hours.p  pAny solution to this problem , or idea or any hints is highly appreciated.p

Negative 386 pI know there are a number of similar questions but I think my circumstances are unique enough to justify an individual one.p  pSpecifically I have an ASP.NET MVC5 web application utilizing jQuery, Kendo UI and Bootstrap. All the references to external libraries are relative i.e. hosted on the server and referenced relatively.p  pIf I clear my cache and navigate to the Azure hosted address a hrefhttpmywebsite.azurewebsites.net relnofollowhttpmywebsite.azurewebsites.neta the jQuery ready event will fire everytime and everything will load correctly.p  pHowever if I clear my cache and navigate to the public domain a hrefhttpmydomainname.com.au relnofollowhttpmydomainname.com.aua the first time the page is loaded the jQuery ready event never occurs and the page fails to load correctly. There appear no console errors or obvious external request failures. However, if I reload the page pressing F5 or CTRL  F5 the page will load correctly and jQuery ready event will fire.p  pAlso note that this problem has been observed deployed both under Azure and hosting company CloudFlare so the Azure part of it is likely irrelevant. p  pAny ideas would be sincerely appreciated...p

Negative 386 pThe C standard states thatp  blockquote   pNonstatic data members shall be initialized in the order they were   declared in the class definition again regardless of the order of the   meminitializers.p blockquote  pWhy Wouldnt it be more intuitive if members were initialized in the order they appear in the initializers and then default to order of declaration if they are not listed in the initializersp  pstrongEDIT RE DUPLICATEstrongp  pThe accepted answer in the other question doesnt seem complete Im happy to be proved wrong but I need more explanation than there is in that answer. p  pIt states that the reason why initialization is always in order of declaration is that while there may be multiple constructors, there can only be one destructor and it needs to use declaration to determine order of destruction. p  pI get why the compiler needs to use declaration order for destruction, but I dont understand why it needs to strictly enforce that same ordering at construction. And if they do need to be symmetrical why allow programmers to arbitrarily define the ordering of the initializers. Seems like if members strongMUSTstrong be initialized in a particular order it should be a compiler error to write initializers in a different order.p

Negative 386 pI want to know how does the compiler efficiently binds the variables in nested functions. Example for nested functions in Cp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main      printfdn, outer0 prints 111     printfdn, outer1 prints 333      return 0   int outerint flag     int x111     int y222      int mid         int y333          int inner             ifflag                 return x returns x defined in outer             return y    retruns y defined in mid which hides the defenition in outer                   return inner           return mid  codepre  pA naive implementation for this would be to scan the entire call stack each time accessing a variable and finding the closest definition of the variable. This may be highly inefficient in the example above when accessing a variable defined in codeoutercode in the body of codeinnercode assuming the function codemidcode calls itself recursively many times before calling codeinnercode.p  pOne optimization that I know of is using access link which is saved in the stack frame of each function call and points to the last stack frame that belongs to a call of a higher nesting level. This would make time complexity of accessing a variable linear with the level of nesting of the function.p  pI have heard of another optimization using emdisplayem or emdisplay arrayem but couldnt find any clear explanation of this concept or its implementation and I hope somebody could explain it to me. p

Negative 386 pIm new to swift and have been playing around with this code all day.  I think I know where the problem is, but Im not quite sure how to solve it.  I have a view controller that contains a UIImageView and Im looking to simply make multiple copies of the same UIImageView at each touch point as the user enters the touchesMoved function.  I created an array to store the elements of all the locations the user had touched and used array.append in the touchesMoved function to collect the points.  I then created a loop that would read in these CGPoints and assign a UIImageView to the point.  The problem is that CGPoints are not convertible to UIImageViews.

I used it because 1. I found that UIImageView copies would mean poor performance and 2. for every five layer copies I make, I want to be able to animate the contentsScale of the layer by 120.  I realize the animation right now is for cornerRadius but thats the only animation that I got to work.  The syntax is alright, but I think my semantics are still a bit off.

Negative 386 pI am building a page that needs to work with touch and mouse interaction on PC, Mac, and mobile browsers.p  pIn the event handler methods for touchStart, touchMove, touchEnd, and touchCancel I am calling event.preventDefault to prevent mobile browsers from firing both touch and mouse events.p  pThis works great for mouseDown and mouseUp, which do not get fired when I touch the screen, but for some reason a short while couple 100ms after each touchStart is fired, the android browser still fires a mouseMove event on the very first touchStart, this mouseMove is preceded by a mouseOver. If I touch quickly enough, the mouseMove gets fired after touchEnd with the same delay relative to touchStart.p  pId really like to prevent any mouse events from being generated from touches and Id also like to understand in detail whats going on here, so I have the following questionsp  ul liIs there some other touch event that I am not capturing which causes the mouseMove eventli liWhy is the mouseMove delayed a bit relative to the touch startli liWhy isnt the mouseMove generated by any other touch events touchMove, touchEndli liDo any other browsers have quirks that might generate mouse events from touchesli liIs there a different crossplatform approach for preventing touch to cause mouse events Maybe some CSSli ul

Negative 386 pI have a set of worker processes System.Threading.Thread that are executing  queries on a MSSQL Server.

Worker opens a transaction, and assigns a reference to it on its wrapper class so I can do some poking around at a breakpoint from the perspective of the watcher thread. Then, it runs a simulate longrunning query command, a WAITFOR... Meanwhile, Watcher sleeps until the worker is waiting for the longrunning query to complete, then hits a breakpoint. At this point, I switch to SSMS and run a modified version of the query from the link abovep  precodeSELECT  FROM sys.dmexecrequests req CROSS APPLY sys.dmexecsqltextsqlhandle AS sqltext WHERE waittype  WAITFOR codepre  pThen I return to VS and dig into the locals which include instancelocal references to the SqlTransaction, SqlConnection and SqlCommand created by Worker to try to find any field with a value that matches one of the columns in the SELECT querys resultset...  p  pHeres an example of the type of class that will be running these queries.

Negative 386 pAccording to my understanding, Distant Supervision is the process of specifying the concept which the individual words of a passage, usually a sentence, are trying to convey. p  pFor example, a database maintains the structured relationship codeconcerns NLP, this sentence.codep  pOur distant supervision system would take as input the sentence codeThis is a sentence about NLP.codep  pBased on this sentence it would recognize the entities, since as a preprocessing step the sentence would have been passed through a namedentity recognizer, codeNLPcode amp codethis sentencecode. p  pSince our database has it that codeNLPcode and codethis sentencecode are related by the bond of codeconcernscode it would identify the input sentence as expressing the relationship codeConcernsNLP, this sentencecode. p  pMy questions is two fold p  p1 What is the use of that Is it that later our system might see a sentence in the wild such as codeThat sentence is about OPPcode and realize that its seen something similar to that before and thereby realize the novel relationship such that codeconcernsOPP, that sentence.code, based only on the words individual tokensp  p2 Does it take into account the actual words of the sentence The verb is and the adverb about for instance, realizing through WordNet or some other hyponymy system that this is somehow similar to the higherorder concept concernsp  pDoes anyone have some code used to generate a distant supervision system that I could look at, i.e. a system that cross references a KB, such as Freebase, and a corpus, such as the NYTimes, and produces a distant supervision database I think that would go a long way in clarifying my conception of distant supervision. p
Negative 386 pI know it is possible to specify codeincludecode filepaths either relative to the directory the file is located in, as an absolute file path, or relative to any of the directories in the codePATHcode system variable. Is there a way to instead specify it relative to the users current directory when the program is compiled Lets say I have the following file structurep  precodedira   a.c   a.h dirb   b.c   b.h makefile codepre  pNow lets say I want to codeincludecode the file codediraa.hcode from codedirbb.hcode. Using the location of codedirbb.hcode, this can be written like thisp  precodeinclude ..diraa.h codepre  pHowever, this approach has a major flaw in my opinion since it hardcodes the locations of files relative to each other, meaning that relocating a file would require updating the file path everywhere that file was included from.p  pUsing absolute file paths would avoid this problem, but would instead hardcode the location of the project within the filesystem, which seems like bad practice.p  pFinally, using the codeltgtcode tags to specify the file path isnt feasible either since I cant assume the project will be listed in the codePATHcode variable.p  pSo what I want to do is to be able to specify the paths relative to where the user compiles from or even better, from the location of the makefile. In the above example, this would let me use the following statement to codeincludecode codediraa.hcode from codedirbb.hcodep  precodeinclude diraa.h codepre  pThis I think would be the ideal solution. It would make the codeincludecode statements more consistent and easier to follow, as well as avoid the drawbacks I listed above. Is it possible to do this in any way, eg. with a compiler flag or something Im using codegcccode as my compiler.p

Negative 386 pHow to pass different datatable for same action in different test casesp  pI have three actions and two test cases which calls these action differently.p  pTC 1 calls action 1 and action 2p  pTC 2 calls action 1 and action 3 with different data for action 1p  pI know we could pass different parameters through action call properties but how can we do the same if we are using Data Tablep  pThanks in advance for any inputp  hr  pAll three Actions are saved as seperate script.p  pSo this is our approach towards automating the applicationp  ol lipWe are trying to drive the automation from ALM and so mapping ALM parameters with UFT parameterpli lipWe are creating modular scripts for resuability which is defined by a functionality. If same functionality is being used in more than one test case we differentiate the step by the usage of a variable. Ex A test case has a process to be run. Either we can use the template which was created earlier or create a new template to initiate the process.  Creation and Using template follow different steps initially but then routes through the same validation. we also have separate manual cases for these. Since only 2 steps are different, we have defined variable which differentiate these using the IF statement. So if variable has value 1, it creates template else run the existing templatepli ol  pTest Case 1  Create New Template  Calling the modules with the Parameters defined during the callp  pRunAction Action1 [Module1], oneIteration,  Create New Template, Parameter1, Parameter2 RunAction Action1 [Module2], oneIteration,p  pTest Case 2  Use Existing Template  Calling the modules with the Parameters defined during the callp  pRunAction Action1 [Module1], oneIteration, Use Existing Template, Parameter3, Parameter4 RunAction Action1 [Module3], oneIteration, Parameter5, Parameter6, Parameter7p  ol start3 liWe are minimizing the usage of data table. However there are cases where data table cannot be avoided. Ex Multiple Forms where user has to add more forms with same fields over and again. These are handled using data sets for each form, from data table. However there are different cases which uses this module and there has to be different data table for each case. How can I implement it Currently since I am using the local data table from module I am unable to use it for different test case. Is there a way to use the local data table of the Test Case and then pass on the values to moduleli ol  pEven if there is a way, there are limitations as Add of form mentioned in the above is just a part of a large functionality. So if we are to  iterate the module for the number of data sets in the data table, we would only need to include a part of the code in itp  pNot sure if I am explaining it properly but do let me know if you are unable to understand and Ill try to explain it betterp

Negative 386 pIm not sure if it is possible to do what Im trying to do, but I thought i would give it a shot anyway. Also, I am fairly new to the SQL Server world and this is my fist post, so I apologize if my wording is poor or if I leave information out. Also, I am working with SQL Server 2005.p  pLets say I have a table named table and a column named column The contents of column is a jumbled mess of characters codentextcode data type. These characters were all drawn in from multiple entry fields in a front end application. Now one of those entry fields was for sensitive information that we no longer need and would like to get rid of but I cant just get rid of the whole column because it also contains other valuable information. Most of the solutions I have found so far only deal with columns that have short entries so they are just able to update the whole string, but for mine I think I need to identify the the beginning and the end of the specific substring that I need and replace it or delete it somehow. This is the closest I have gotten to at least selecting the data that I need... AAA and AAA mark the beginning and the end of the substring that I need.p  precodeselect      substring column, charindex AAA, column, charindex AAA,column  from table  where column like AAA codepre  pThe problems I am having with this one are that the substring doesnt stop at AAA, it just keeps going, and some of the results are just blank so it looks something likep  ol listrongAAA 12345 AAAstrong abcdefghijklmnopli listrongAAA 12346 AAAstrong qrstuvwxyzabcdefli lippli lipstrongAAA 12347 AAAstrong abcdefghijklmnoppli ol  pWith the characters in bold being the information I need to get rid of. Also even though row 3 is blank, it still does contain the info that I need but Im guessing that it isnt returning it because it has a different amount of characters before it for example, rows 1, 2, and 4 might have 50 characters before them but row 3 might have 100 characters before it, at least thats the only reason that I could think of.p  pSo I suppose the first step would probably be to actually select the right substring, then to either delete it or replace it with a different, meaningless substring like 111111 or something.p  pIf there is more information that you need to be provided with or if I was unclear about anything please let me know and thank you for taking the time to read through and hopefully answer my questionp  pstrongEditstrong Another  one that gets close to the right results goes something like thisp  precode    select substringcolumn,charindexAAA,column,20 from table where column like AAA codepre  pIm not sure if this approach would work better since the substring im looking for is always going to have the same amount of characters. The problem with this one though, is that instead of having blank rows, they are replaced with irrelevant substrings from that column, but all of the other rows do return exactly what I want.p

Heres my attemptp  precodeenum UserTypeString      case Normal     case Admin   class User MTLModel, MTLJSONSerializing      var typeUserType      static func JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey gt [NSObject  AnyObject]              return [type  type]           static func JSONTransformerForKeykey String gt NSValueTransformer              if key  type                      return NSValueTransformerforName UserTypeValueTransformer                   return nil         Custom Transformer class UserTypeValueTransformer  NSValueTransformer      override func transformedValuevalue AnyObject gt UserType              let theValueString  value as String          return theValue  Admin  UserType.Admin  UserType.Normal           override func reverseTransformedValuevalue AnyObject gt AnyObject              let theValueUserType  value as UserType          return theValue  UserType.Admin  Admin  Normal       codepre  pIn the code above, I made a custom transformer for converting a codeStringcode to a codeUserTypecode enum value and back. I have overridden codeMantlescode codeJSONTransformerForKeycode method and specified my custom transformer for the codetypecode property in order to perform the conversion. When I try to serialize the JSON into a codeUsercode object, I receive this error messagep  precodetype is not a property of User codepre  pcodetypecode is clearly a property of the codeUsercode model, but something is going on that is making codeMantlecode not able to recognize it.p  pWhat should I change in my implementation to get the codeStringcode to enum conversion to work Thanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 386 pI am trying to write tests to check the behaviour of ongoing notifications, and for this reason i decided to extend NotificationServiceListener to get information about notifications. I used the kpbird example a hrefhttpsgithub.comkpbirdNotificationListenerServiceExample relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkpbirdNotificationListenerServiceExamplea.p  pWhen i run the application in normal mode, the service appears to be working. However, when i try to run a test case to do the same instructions with robotium commands, the service doesnt appear to be responding the log messages put inside onNotificationReceived and onNotificationRemoved are not appearing in debug screen.p  pOne thing in kpbird example i found odd, was the lack of service launch instructions, but because the service responded and appeared to be working, i just assume, that it is just the way the NotificationServiceListener works.p  pOther thing i noticed was, that when app was launched normally, only the onNotificationReceived and noNotificationRemoved functions are being called. However, when i run the test, i also get  services onCreate called before the ITestRunner started message.p  pI tried to manually launch the service from test case, but still got no responses from it.p  pSo i am wondering, is there any reason, why the service is acting odd when app is being testedp

Negative 386 pIm trying to introduce weights for my training instances in neural network toolbox in Matlab. Am I doing everything correctly I have to ask because as far as I can see, NN toolbox documentation can suite only very basic needs. Everything else is not that straightforward.p  pSo I create neural network as followsp  precodenet  patternnet[5,5] codepre  pLets also say, my network has 4 possible outputsor 4 possible classes in my classification problem, if you want. This is strongtrainstrong function signaturep  precode[net,tr]  trainnet,X,T,Xi,Ai,EW codepre  pHere strongEWstrong represents error weights as it stated in documentation. As far as I understood from reading docs and some articles in the web, I have to have strongEWstrong in a form of a cell array that has the same dimensions as my labels arrayp  pImagine that my labels array is strong[N 4]strong matrix, where codeNcode is a number of training examples. So,the question is am I doing correctly if I want to introduce equal weights for all instancesp  precodeEW  onessizelabels EW  num2cellEW codepre  pThank youp

Negative 386 pI have an OrientDB graph database with nodes connected in series with link of type codeNEXTcode. There are several distinct series in my data, and no node has more than one incoming and one outgoing NEXT link. The nodes all have a property called name. I would like to find all the sequences of name that occur in traversing the paths from start to end.p  pI.e. to get one sequence of names, start at a node which has no incoming NEXT link, follow the NEXT links until you have reached a node with no outgoing NEXT links, and gather up into a list all the names of the nodes you have passed. p  pe.g. a subgraph of form      codeBob[NEXT]gtSharon[NEXT]gtCarlcode should give the list      code[Bob, Sharon, Carl]codep  pFor clarification, here is a Cypher Neo4j query which gets me all the possible lists.p  precode    match start [NEXT]gt end,     p  shortestPathstart[NEXT]gt end     where not [NEXT]gtstart and not end[NEXT]gt     return extract s in nodesp  s.name  as path codepre  pHowever, I need to do this in OrientDB, which doesnt use Cypher.p  pI would like to know whether this is possible in OrientDB, and if so whether it is simpler in the SQL language or Gremlin.p  pAs a secondary question, ideally I would like to not return all the lists of names, because what I really care about is how often each list occurs. So instead I want to return the unique lists with how often that particular list was found. Is this possible to do in OrientDB, or would I have to retrieve all the path data from OrientDB as above and do the aggregation somewhere elsep

Thank you for contacting Bigcommerce p blockquote  pI hate to say that details of updating of order line items is sparse because it is not fully built out at this time. There are ways to update existing line items  similar to what you have tried but you would need to include an id parameter for an existing product in the order if you wanted to overwrite an existing line item. The problem though is the totals calculations do not appear to come out correct when making updates to things like existing products. I have seen similar strangeness making changes to existing shipping addresses. Now you emareem able to additionally update totalinctax and totalextax to make that accurate but the totaltax line item still seems to come out incorrect in some cases. p  pIt really is something that was not properly addressed with the v2 API and needs work in the next version that is going to be coming out. In the meantime my advice would be to not update existing orders in this way and instead create a new order and trash the original if you need to update products or the shipping address. Updating other details on the order do not seem to have these same negative consequences. p  pI am sorry as I am sure this is not what you wanted to hear. Please let me know if you have any questions about the above and I will do what I can to assist.p

Negative 386 pI try to have a banner on top of my pagewordpress. On top of the banner should be a institution logo, limited to the size of the banner I want other users to be able to substitute the banner. The theme is responsive I got it to work with the code below, however in old Android native browser versions the institution logo is not limited to the banner but continues until the content area. I dont have many android devices to test, but this behavior definetly appears on Android 4.1 and seems fixed in 4.4.p  pLooking at my code, I think all I used is really old html stuff so this should already be supported by Android 4.1 browser.I dont have a clue why the behavior is as it is.p  pI would be thankful for a explanation. What could I do to fix the behavior for my site If it is not possible to realize this behavior for older android versions, would it be possible to detect the android version browser version keyword user agent to detect if version is smaller than xxx.p  pI hope someone can help me, because I dont have a clue how to advance.p  pHtmlp  precodeltdiv idlogogt   ltdivgt     ltimg srcimagesbanner.jpg  heightltphp echo getcustomheadergtheight gt widthltphp echo getcustomheadergtwidth gt gt   ltdivgt   ltdiv idinstitutionlogo gt     ltimg srcimagesinstitutionlogo.gif  heightauto widthauto  stylemaxheight100 maxwidth100 left 5gt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precodeinstitutionlogo positionabsolute top 0px  left 0 width20 height 100 padding 2  codepre
