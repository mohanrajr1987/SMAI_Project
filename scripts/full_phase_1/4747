Positive 4747 pI have a warning from GCC that a base class should be initialized in the copy constructor. The problem is, I embelieveem the original intention is its a constructor, but not a copy constructor. Heres what the simplified version looks like I added the initializer codeBasecode in response to the warningp  precodeclass Base  ...   class Derived  public Base    public     DerivedDerivedamp d, int x  0        Base, mbd  ...    protected     Baseamp mb  codepre  pcodeclass Derivedcode provides the codeBasecode interface, and it has a codeBasecode member. The design is such that data can flow from a source to a sink, with arbitrary intermediate objects in between that can transform or process data arbitrary but constrained by the interface.p  pThe distinction between constructor and copy constructor is important. In the case of the constructor, codeBasecode is being default initialized and in the case of a copy constructor, codeBasecode is being initialized with coderhscode.p  pIs it sufficient to use the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma620402608639default constructeda base codeBasecode to give the compiler a hint that its a constructor, but not a copy constructorp  pIf not, how do I tell the compiler that the constructor is emnotem a copy constructor Im happy to use a GCC extension, like an codeattributecode, to direct the compiler in the right direction.p  pThe other option, change the signature, cannot happen at the moment because it breaks versioning requirements on most major platforms, like a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationMacOSXConceptualBPFrameworksConceptsVersionInformation.html relnofollowApplea.p  hr  pHere are the files in questionp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.cryptopp.comdocsrefasn8hsource.html relnofollowasn.hali lia hrefhttpwww.cryptopp.comdocsrefasn8cppsource.html relnofollowasn.cppali ul  pHere is the compiler warning the namespace has been removed for brevityp  precodeg DDEBUG g2 O2 Wall Wextra fPIC marchnative pipe c asn.cpp asn.cpp In copy constructor DERGeneralEncoderDERGeneralEncoderDERGeneralEncoderamp, byte asn.cpp4971 warning base class class ByteQueue should be explicitly initialized in the copy constructor [Wextra]  DERGeneralEncoderDERGeneralEncoderDERGeneralEncoder ampoutQueue, byte asnTag codepre  pcodeasn.cpp497code is pointing to a hrefhttpwww.cryptopp.comdocsrefasn8cppsource.htmll00487 relnofollowline 487a the second constructor in the unmodified online sources.p  pThe system is Fedora 22, x8664, fully patched, with GCC 5.1.1p  precode uname a Linux localhost.localdomain 4.1.6201.fc22.x8664 1 SMP Fri Sep 4 174924 UTC 2015 x8664 x8664 x8664 GNULinux  lsbmodule bash lsbmodule command not found...  g version g GCC 5.1.1 20150618 Red Hat 5.1.14 ... codepre

Positive 4747 pGCC has function attributes alwaysinline, noinline, and flatten which let you control inlining behavior when defining a function. Im wondering if there is a way to customize inlining behavior emwhere the function is calledem, rather than setting a global inlining behavior for it like the attributes normally do.p  pFor noinline, I can wrap a call inside a lambda with the noinline attribute and call the lambda immediately. For flatten I can wrap the function inside a template function that has truefalse specializations that call the underlying function, one with flatten and one without.p  pBut for alwaysinline I have no such hack. Does one exist To be clear, Im looking to be able to say that a specific call to codefcode should be inlined, not cause it to always be inlined everywhere.p

The jniEntry function then calls the device func contained in cudaprogram.cup  pI cant seem generate the .so file from the generated .o files i.e. cudaprogram.o from cudaprogram.cu and cEntry.o from cEntry.cwhich is the bridge for JNI i.e. jclass.java  jclass.classfrom javac amp jclass.hfrom javah jni My makefile is p  precodeINCLUDES     ICUDASDKPATHinc ICUDAPATHinclude  IJDKPATHinclude IJDKPATHincludelinux I.

Positive 4747 pThis question is about something that after more than a year with C I cant solve or find any solution about it.p  pI got used to using separate files for headers and code in C, but I have a problem with it on C whenever I edit a header file and try to compile the code that uses it again, the compiler doesnt notice the change on the header.p  pWhat I do to solve this is compiling the header .hpp alone. Sometimes I just add it to the list of source files for g along with the rest of the code, but what happens then is that I have to execute the command twice the first time it gives me errors, but not the second time. It also warns me that Im using the pragma once option in a main file.p  pI know this is very wrong, so Ive searched for a correct way to do this, without success. I have noticed that g generates .gch files but I dont really know whats their purpose, although they may be related.p  pI suspect that the problem is caused because of the code in the .hpp. I know I think that the good way to do it is to define prototypes only inside the header and writing the body of the methods in a separate file, but sometimes specially when using templates this generates even more problems.p

Positive 4747 pIm having trouble with stdfunctions created from lambdas if the function returns a reference but the return type isnt explicitly called out as a lambda. It seems that the stdfunction is created fine with no warnings, but upon calling it, a value is returned when a reference is expected, causing things to blow up. Heres a very contrived examplep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt include ltfunctionalgt  int main    stdvectorltintgt v    v.pushback123    stdfunctionltconst stdvectorltintgtampconst stdvectorltintgtampgt callback        []const stdvectorltintgt ampinreturn in    stdcout ltlt callbackv.at0 ltlt stdendl    return 0  codepre  pThis prints out garbage, however if the lambda is modified to explicitly return a const reference it works fine. I can understand the compiler thinking the lambda is returnbyvalue without the hint when I originally ran into this problem, the lambda was directly returning the result from a function that returned a const reference, in which case I would think that the const reference return of the lambda would be deducible, but apparently not. What I am surprised by is that the compiler lets the stdfunction be constructed from the lambda with mismatched return types. Is this behavior expected Am I missing something in the standard that allows this mismatch to occur Im seeing this with g GCC 4.8.2, havent tried it with anything else.p  pThanksp

As context, Im currently writing my first real application which is the ubiquitous blog engine using asp.net MVC. Im loosely following the MVC Storefront architecture with my own adjustments. As such, this is my first real foray into mocking objects. Ill put the code example at the end of the question.p  pId appreciate any insight or outside resources that I could use to increase my understanding of the fundamentals of testing and mocking. The resources Ive found on the net are typically geared towards the how of mocking and I need more understanding of the where, why and when of mocking. If this isnt the best place to ask this question, please point me to a better place.p  pIm trying to understand the value that Im getting from the following tests. The UserService is dependent upon the IUserRepository. The value of the service layer is to separate your logic from your data storage, but in this case most of the UserService calls are just passed straight to IUserRepository. The fact that there isnt much actual logic to test could be the source of my concerns as well. I have the following concerns.p  ul liIt feels like the code is just testing that the mocking framework is working. li liIn order to mock out the dependencies, it makes my tests have too much knowledge of the IUserRepository implementation. Is this a necessary evil li liWhat value am I actually gaining from these tests Is the simplicity of the service under test causing me to doubt the value of these tests. li ul  pIm using NUnit and Rhino.Mocks, but it should be fairly obvious what Im trying to accomplish.p  precode    [SetUp]     public void Setup              userRepo  MockRepository.GenerateMockltIUserRepositorygt         userSvc  new UserServiceuserRepo         theUser  new User                      ID  null,             UserName  httpjoe.myopenid.com,             EmailAddress  joejoeblow.com,             DisplayName  Joe Blow,             Website  httpjoeblow.com                    [Test]     public void UserServicecancreateanewuser               Arrange         userRepo.Expectrepo gt repo.CreateUsertheUser.Returntrue           Act         bool result  userSvc.CreateUsertheUser           Assert         userRepo.VerifyAllExpectations         Assert.Thatresult, Is.True,            UserService.CreateUseruser failed when it should have succeeded           [Test]     public void UserServicecannotcreateanexistinguser               Arrange         userRepo.Stubrepo gt repo.IsExistingUsertheUser.Returntrue         userRepo.Expectrepo gt repo.CreateUsertheUser.Returnfalse          Act         bool result  userSvc.CreateUsertheUser           Assert         userRepo.VerifyAllExpectations         Assert.Thatresult, Is.False,              UserService.CreateUser allowed multiple copies of same user to be created      codepre

Negative 4747 pI heard on Windows x64 architecture, in order to support to run both x86 and x64 application, there is two separatedifferent sets of Windows registry  one for x86 application to access and the other for x64 application to access For example, if a COM registers CLSID in the x86 set of registry, then x64 application will never be able to access the COM component by CLSID, because x86x64 have different sets of registryp  pSo, my question is whether my understanding of the above sample is correct I also want to get some more documents to learn this topic, about the two different sets of registry on x64 architecture.

Negative 4747 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7095isthecsharpstaticconstructorthreadsafeIs the C static constructor thread safea  p blockquote    pJon Skeets excellent article at a hrefhttpcsharpindepth.comArticlesGeneralSingleton.aspx relnofollowhttpcsharpindepth.comArticlesGeneralSingleton.aspxa and other articles Ive read make it clear that that doublecheck locking doesnt work in both C and Java unless one explicitly marks the instance as volatile. If you dont, the check of comparing it to null could possibly return false even though the instance constructor hasnt finished running. In Mr. Skeets third sample, he states this clearly The Java memory model doesnt ensure that the constructor completes before the reference to the new object is assigned to instance. The Java memory model underwent a reworking for version 1.5, but doublecheck locking is still broken after this without a volatile variable as in Cp  pHowever, most everyone agrees including Mr. Skeet, in samples four and five in his article, that the use of static initialization is a simple way to get a threadsafe singleton instance. He states that static constructors in C are specified to execute only when an instance of the class is created or a static member is referenced, and to execute only once per AppDomain.p  pThat makes sense, but what seems to be missing is the guarantee that the reference to the new object is assigned only after the constructor completes  otherwise wed get the same kind of issue that makes doublecheck locking fail unless you mark the instance as volatile. Is there a guarantee that, when using static initialization to call the instance constructor as opposed to calling the instance constructor from a propertys get, like we do with doublecheck locking, that the constructor will fully complete before any other thread can get a reference to the objectp  pThanksp

Negative 4747 pI like the idea of OpenID, I really do. But few of my target users have even heard of it  yet. If I want to offer OpenID as an option, my only choice would seem to come down to offering BOTH emailpassword authentication AND OpenID.p  pIve seen several sites that use this combination and the idea seems unappealing to put it mildly. Placing both options on the same screen is distracting and pointless if only 10 of users will even care about OpenID.p  pSo Im wondering, how could I offer a single user interface that supports BOTH OpenID and emailpassword for authentication and account creationp  pOne possibility Ive been considering is to use a single OpenIDemail field that can detect whether an email or OpenID was used and then dynamically adjust the interface accordingly.p  pFor example, an account creation page might start off with a single field labelled email with some unobtrusive text along the lines of we support OpenID. If a user enters a url, then the interface switches to an OpenID account creation page via JavaScript. If an email address is entered, nothing happens.p  pWhats the best method youve seen for hiding OpenID from the average user, but at the same time letting techsavvy users know that your site supports itp

I can convert from the details collection directly to a double displaying sum, and bind a TextBlocks Text to the Details OneWay, via the IValueConverter.  This will work, and show the correct values when I open the window.p  pHowever, if I change one of the detail members, this will not update even though detail implements INotifyPropertyChanged, since the collection itself is still the same the ObservableCollection reference hasnt changed.p  pI want to have an aggregated value in a master list, showing the sum or averagecountetc within the detail list, and have this stay up to date when the user changes properties in details.  How can I go about implementing thisp  phr p  pEdit p  pIdeally, I would prefer if there is a means of accomplishing this that doesnt involve changing the Master class directly.

Negative 4747 pAs a longtime Ruby and Rails user, it never struck me until today to really think about the getandredirect pattern in Rails.  The typical example of this would be calling a create action, and then redirecting the user to a show action to display the newlycreated itemp  pre class JournalEntries    def index     entries  JournalEntry.all   end    def create     entry  JournalEntry.new name  todo list      entry.save     redirectto action  index   end end  pre  pHowever, this has the inherent disadvantage that you are doubling your network traffic.  This both slows down your users site experience, as well as increasing your bandwidth charges.p  pSo why not just do this insteadp  pre   def create     entry  JournalEntry.new name  todo list      entry.save     index pre  pSame output, and no extra overhead required.  But in addition to this, there is an even more substantial problem redirectto can only redirect using GET.  This causes major problems for RESTful apps that use four different HTTP methods.p  pIn my case, I wanted a user to be able to call journals8 and retrieve the Journal with that ID.  If it wasnt found, I wanted to create a new, empty Journal object.  In either case, the Journal object would then be sent to the caller.p  pNote that the create method in RESTful Rails is routed from POST players.  But since redirectto and the underlying HTTP redirect can only send GET requests, it actually redirects to GET players, which is the index method.  This behavior is clearly wrong.p  pThe only solution I could think of was to simply call create instead of redirectto as in my example above.  It seems to work fine.p  pAny thoughts on why redirectto is preferred to calling actions directlyp

Id like to avoid having to write a custom copy application that would read the xlsx file and copy the rows and formatting to another file. Preferably, the solution is open source andor free.p  pI have looked at POI, and as far as I could tell, it can read and write both xls and xlsx files. But I was not able to tell by browsing the documentation and examples if it could read one format and write out in the other. Before I dig in any deeper, I would like to check if any of you out there have done anything like this before in Java, and if you have any tips.p
Negative 4747 pIve been doing a fair bit of work with OAuth recently, and I have to say that I really like it.  I like the concept, and I like how it provides a low barrierofentry for your users to connect up the external data to your site or for you to provide the data apis for consumption externally.  Personally, Ive always balked at sites that ask me to provide my login for another website to them directly.  And OAuth valet key for the web approach solves this nicely.p  pThe biggest problem I and many others see with it though, is the standard OAuth workflow encourages the same type of behaviors that phishing attacks use to their advantage.  If you train your user that it is normal behavior to be redirected to a site to provide login credentials, then it is easy for a phishing site to exploit that normal behavior but instead redirect to their clone site where they capture your username and password.p  pWhat, if anything, have you done or seen done to alleviate this problemp  ul lipDo you tell the users to go and login to the providing site manually, without automatic links or redirection but then this increases the barrier of entrypli lipDo you attempt to educate your users, and if so, when and how  Any lengthy explanation of security that the user has to read also increases the barrier of entry.pli ul  pWhat elsep

Negative 4747 pI know that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions767372javastringequalsversus767379767379when comparing codeStringcodes, you should use code.equalscode not codecodea and I understand the reasons for this.

Negative 4747 pIm doing a lot of digging around in log files these days, which usually involves tracking a certain identifier through various places in the log file.

I also tried to use Jaccard Similarity analyzer to find distance between successive sentences and tried to group successive sentences into one paragraph if the distance  between them was less than a given value. Is there a better methodp  pThis is my text samplep  blockquote   pSylvester Gardenzio Stallone , nicknamed Sly Stallone,  is an American actor, filmmaker and screenwriter. Stallone is known for his machismo  and Hollywood action roles. Stallones film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry as well as having its film props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallones use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps.A commercial, educational, and cultural center, Philadelphia was once the secondlargest city in the British Empire  after London, and the social and geographical center of the original 13 American colonies. It was a centerpiece of early American history, host to many of the ideas and actions that gave birth to the American Revolution and independence.The American Revolution was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which thirteen colonies in North America joined together to break free from the British Empire, combining to become the United States of America. They first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a Provincial Congress, or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual selfgoverning states.p blockquote

For each subsequent operation that is to share that same connection, the client copies the MainRef, and then passes the address of that copy, setting the ShareConnection flag to tell the library that this DNSServiceRef is not a typical uninitialized DNSServiceRef its a copy of an existing DNSServiceRef whose connection information should be reused. p blockquote  pThere is even an example that shows how to use the flag.

Negative 4747 pFrom what I understood  from all the documentations of codeselectcode, it seems that codeselectcodeing on a write fdset could be used to check for socket descriptor availibility for codesendcodeing so that could be used to detect a successful nonblocking codeconnectcode attempt, but what I dont get is when does a socket ever become unavailable after a successful codeconnectcode or codeacceptcode And does that in theory mean that the socket is always available for codesendcodeingp  pAs a last question, is it practical to keep codeselectcodeing connected sockets in for write operations for the whole sessionp  pThanks.p

Negative 4747 pI am in need of parsing a small subset of English for one of my project, described as a contextfree grammar with 1level feature structures a hrefhttpcode.google.compnltksourcebrowsetrunknltkexamplesgrammarsbookgrammarsfeat0.fcfgr8260examplea and I need to do it efficiently .p  pRight now Im using a hrefhttpwww.nltk.orgNLTKas parser which produces the right output but is very slow. For my grammar of 450 fairly ambiguous nonlexicon rules and half a million lexical entries, parsing simple sentences can take anywhere from 2 to 30 seconds, depending it seems on the number of resulting trees. Lexical entries have little to no effect on performance.p  pAnother problem is that loading the 25MB grammarlexicon at the beginning can take up to a minute.p  pFrom what I can find in literature, the running time of the algorithm used to parse such a grammar Earley or CKY should be linear to the size of the grammar and cubic to the size of the input token list. My experience with NLTK indicates that ambiguity is what hurts the performance most, not the absolute size of the grammar.p  pSo now Im looking for a CFG parser to replace NLTK. Ive been considering a hrefhttpwww.dabeaz.complyPLYa but I cant tell whether it supports feature structures in CFGs, which are required in my case, and the examples Ive seen seem to be doing a lot of procedural parsing rather than just specifying a grammar. Can anybody show me an example of PLY both supporting feature structs and using a declarative grammarp  pIm also fine with any other parser that can do what I need efficiently. A Python interface is preferable but not absolutely necessary.p

However, Im trying to understand how efficient it is, especially when I have, say, thousands of lines to draw in step b. The alternative is using PyOpenGL, but before getting into that I wanted to understand if PIL was already fast enough.p  pI was going to ask if PIL used OpenGL under the covers. But that might be the wrong question, because my understanding is that to get the real speed benefit from PyOpenGL Id want to submit my line vertexes as NumPy arrays. So presumably even if PIL uses OpenGL, Im going to lose a lot of that benefit when I make an individual PIL call to draw each of my linesp  pAnybody have concrete data for speed of PIL when drawing lots of primitivesp

Negative 4747 phey, im not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but Im having troubles with a script of mine. im trying to do some database merging with PHP, a onetime merge. What I am doing is grabbing a list of all the unique titles of a book, then foreaching through those titles finding books with that title and grouping by types, then foreaching through that result finding books with that unique title and type, repeating the process with copyrights and publishers. the main issue is that this takes so long the mysql server times out. Is there a better way to do this, possibly with SQLp  pAn example of merge would be thisp  precodeINSERT INTO books 1, Some Book, Penguin Publishing, 2005, 1 INSERT INTO books 2, Some Book, Penguin Publishing, 2005, 1 INSERT INTO books 3, Some Book 2, Penguin Publishing, 2005, 1 INSERT INTO books 4, Some Book 2, Lion Publishing, 2005, 1 INSERT INTO books 5, Some Book 2, Penguin Publishing, 2005, 2 INSERT INTO books 6, Some Book 2, Penguin Publishing, 2005, 2 INSERT INTO books 7, Somebody, Lion Publishing, 2005, 1 INSERT INTO books 8, Somebody, Lion Publishing, 2007, 1 INSERT INTO books 9, Somebody, Penguin Publishing, 2005, 1 codepre  pIds 1amp2 should join because they have 1 the same title 2 the same materialtypeid 3 the same copyright and 4 the same publisher.p  pIs there any way to achieve this with PURE SQL or with minor PHPp  pHere is my data structurep  precodeCREATE TABLE books    id int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   title varchar255 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,   publisher varchar255 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,   copyright varchar255 COLLATE utf8unicodeci DEFAULT NULL,   materialtypeid int11 DEFAULT NULL   PRIMARY KEY id,   FULLTEXT KEY title title  ENGINEMyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COLLATEutf8unicodeci codepre  pemEDITem I guess I forgot to mention something really important. I cant just use a GROUP query because I need to use the ids. I have another table called Items that has the field, bookid. If i just GROUP the records, Ill end up with orphaned items.

Negative 4747 pDoes it hurt to execute an codeNSFetchRequestcode that retrieves a lot of objects, maybe around 3  5K I understand Core Data uses something called faulting that ensures objects are not in memory until they are actually needed.

Negative 4747 pI fear Ive stumbled into unknown Magento territory. I have exhausted whats left of my Googling abilities and have come up short, so I thought Id try my luck here.p  pOur platform is Magento Enterprise 1.9.1.1.p  pWe use an archaic print solution that reads orders via ODBC. As such, we cant have it read from Magentos MySQL database directly thanks to the high likelihood of change. What Ive done is extend MageSalesModelOrder to intercept the beforeSave function with direct SQL queries to another database, before returning parentbeforeSave. There are likely better ways to have done this, but its done now, and functional, and regardless it is not where my problem lies.p  pIf any SQL errors are thrown, updates are rolled back and the errors amp order data are passed to a function that sends an email to a mailing list with the error information. The email template file in localeenUStemplateemail calls on a .phtml file to process the arrays of data like sop  precodeblock typecoretemplate areafrontend templateemailerrorsorderbeforesave.phtml orderdataorderdata errorserrors  codepre  pThis is functionality I borrowed from localeenUStemplateemailsalesshipmentnew.phtml. And this is also where I hit my roadblock. The email fires fine from the front end, if errors are encountered when the user is processing an order. If you make order changes from adminhtml, the email is sent, but without the above mentioned block.p  pI have tried with and without areafrontend in the block call, and the script exhibits the same behaviour regardless.p  pI think that the problem may be in my XML, though it finds the template itself just fine from both admin and frontend and this block is not required to be defined in my XML anywhere. I can also not find any examples of this within Magentos own files, or anywhere on the internet.p  pAny help would be more than greatly appreciated. This is doing my head inp  ul liMikeli ul

Negative 4747 pIm currently working on a small project lt 10k loc which is mainly pure but relies on mutable optimizations mainly based on iterators and some datastructure reuse for heavyduty calculations. p  pId like to learn a bit more functional programming and want to get more type safety, by e.g. wrapping mutable computations into state transformer monads and the like. For this purpose there exists the scalaz library.p  h3Question Oneh3  pWhen abstracting my computations on a larger scale by using all the fancy functional stuff, will I introduce performance killers that I wont get rid of Like when my calculation is wrapped deep to the knees in Monadsp  h3Question Twoh3  pIs it feasibly at all considering Scalas limited type inference Im currently fighting with very large type signatures maybe because I dont know how to properly get rid of them. I suppose that going more functional will introduce even more such boilerplate code.p  h3Disclaimerh3  pIm not questioning whether the functional approach is good or bad. Asking this question for Haskell is pointless. I am questioning whether it is sensible doing so for Scala.p  h3Edit on request example of large type signatures in my projecth3  pembut this would be a different questionemp  pThe following code describes an iterative computation on a typeparameterized input object codeDiscreteFactorGraph[VariableType, FactorType[VariableType]]code. You can construct a computation object with codecreateInitialStatecode and perform computation on it with codeadvanceStatecode and finally extract some information from it with codemarginalscode.p  pI want the type of the factor graph object and its parameter types to be preserved during the computation so that the final application of codemarginalscode yields the correct type of codeDiscreteMarginals[VariableType]code. I think currently I only have to preserve the variable type inside the computation type which is codeTStatecode, so carrying around the factor type is not used. But at a different place I need even the type of codeDiscreteFactorGraphcode to be variable, so I tend to need more type information carried through the computation in the future.p  pI was fiddlying around with this part a lot and I hope theres some better solution. Currently I have a pretty functional approach, where there are only those three functions. But I have to chain the type through them.

Negative 4747 pI am trying to debug a tricky situation with autocorrection not getting correctly handled in a TextBox, but I am stuck I cannot find how the tapping of an autocorrection suggestion in the SIP gets communicated to the TextBox. I have traced the KeyUp, KeyDown, TextInput, TextInputStart and TextInputUpdate events, but they do not seem to be involved in the update of the Text in the TextBox object.p  pBackgroundp  pWhen a language other than Greek is used, autocorrection works as it should for a TextBox in my app. However, when the language is set to Greek, nothing happens when tapping on the suggested word ... On the other hand, in TextBoxes in standard phone apps e.g. adding text in the Notes section of a contact Greek autocorrection works perfectly. So, my first guess is that there is something wrong with the TextBox rather than with the SIP. My plan is to subclass TextBox, modifying only its autocorrection handling parts.p  pAny help would be much appreciated,p  pGerasimosp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI made a few tests and this seems to be a problem in all non standard apps. Specifically, I tested the eBay and SkyMap applications and in both cases English autocorrections work, while Greek do not.p  pThe problem is easy to reproducep  ul liput a textbox in an application with an inputScope that has autocorrections enabledli liuse a Greek keyboard layoutli litap 12 random letters.li litap on one of the proposed autocorrections. Only the final space is introduced, and in cases that the cursor is between two spaces as I preferred to test it nothing happens.li ul  pSo, I believe that there is a bug somewhere in the framework part and not in the application code. Now, if we could find how this autocorrection tapping is communicated to the TextBox... p

Negative 4747 pI have a small program that mmaps potentially dangerous executable code with PROTEXEC, calls codeprctlPRSETSECCOMP, 1code and then executes this mmapd code. This is all well and good, and allows me to save the state of the evaluation by sync the mmapd region to disk, and reload it later most likely on another machine for load balancing. However, this technique doesnt always work  because this code might have made changes to the program that are not in the mmapd region, and this information will be lost.p  pSo what I would like to do, is make absolutely everything other than this mmapd region readonly before calling the code. This way I have a guarantee that the executable code cant change the state of anything other than the mmapd region which I can serializedeserialize at will.p  pBTW this is Linux on x8664p  pThanksp

Negative 4747 pI created a iOS tabbed application using xcode 4.2 and storyboard.

When I try to attach the iSubProducts tableviewcontroller using or from a button, it all works fine, but if its coming from row clicked, this error shows up.p  pIm quite new with iOS development, and maybe there is a error opening tableviewcontroller from a tableviewcontroller with a custom cell on it.

Im pretty sure theres no error on the iSubProducts tableviewcontroller since its working if i tried pushing it from a button.

Negative 4747 pI have a rails 3.1 app that stores images in a binary field in a postgresql database I am aware of potential issues with storing images in a database, but have to do so for now. Everything works fine locally in development mode and specs on OSX, but all images are broken in the app deployed to Heroku. Ive verified that the data in the database is correct by pointing my local machine at the same database that the heroku instance uses, and all images displayed correctly.p  pSo, the problem seems to lie in ActiveRecord running on Heroku loading the data from the database. Im also guessing it is an encoding issue. Running the rails console locally I can verify that the bytesize of these fields are correct, but running the rails console on Heroku shows an incorrect bytesize. In fact, loading an N byte file via ActiveRecord on Heroku results in a bytesize of 2N1 for all files.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

My question is, when creating an entity, should I populate its properties from within the controller, or from within a servicep  pExample 1  Populating from within controller  p  precode MyController.php function someAction    name  POST[name]   gender  POST[gender]    user  new User   usergtsetNamename   usergtsetGendergender    userServicegtcreateUseruser    UserService.php function createUseruser    thisgtsaveToDbuser  codepre  pExample 2  Populating from within servicep  precode MyController.php function someAction    name  POST[name]   gender  POST[gender]    userServicegtcreateUsername, gender    UserService.php function createUsername, gender    user  new User   usergtsetNamename   usergtsetGendergender    thisgtsaveToDbuser  codepre  pI like the 2nd approach better, because I feel the controller should simply delegate work out, and the service layer should do the heavy lifting.p  pIt also seems to follow the DRY principle because if I have multiple controllers that need to create codeUsercode objects, I wont be repeating any code. The same goes for writing unit tests  I can simply pass all the arguments to the service object.p  pBut Ive seen the first method used as well, and Im wondering if theres some advantage to it that Im not seeing. p

Negative 4747 pFrom what I understand, in SPARC, 32bit integer quantities are stored in single registers and 64bit integer quantities are stored in adjacent register pairs, with the even register containing the high 32 bits and the odd register containing the low 32 bits.p  pI need to write a few specialized SPARC inline assembly macros inline assembly functions would be fine too that deal with 64bit integer doubleword pairs, and I cant figure out how to refer generically using GCC extended inline assembly to the two halves of the pair in my inline assembly.

Negative 4747 pThe model that I am currently developing involves three elementsp  ol liA client application with a rather rich GUIli liAn ASP.NETIIS web serverli liAnd a local in regard to 2 Windows process console applicationli ol  pIn my mind, the client application 1 posts a query string to the ASP.NETIIS web server 2, which informs the local Windows process 3 of the query parameters, executes the desired function, and returns the data to 2 then that to 1.p  pThe necessity of such a seemingly convoluted procession arises from the nature of the Windows process. This console application uses RPC to connect and authenticate itself against a second server. As you can imagine, this process is expensive.p  pIf I merge the Windows process and ASP.NETIIS page, then a new connection is opened with every request. This is hardly reasonable if dozens of POSTs are made in quick succession, since each authentication case takes about four seconds.p  pFortunately, the Windows console application can login once and maintain the session. Therefore, I must find a solution to interface with this console application, given the the source of any interaction will derive from an ASP.NETIIS page.p  pIve read nearly every post on StackoverflowMSDN concerning topics encompassing this issue. I know that I can employ remoting, pipes, sockets, WCF, etc.p  pSo I ask all of you If youve encountered a similar issue, how did you solve it Im merely asking for a definitive point in the correct direction. If you can include code, Ill appreciate your response even more.p  pThank you very much for any and all help. p

Negative 4747 pJust to clarify that I also think the title is a bit silly. We all know that most builtin functions of the language are really well written and fast there are ones even written by assembly. Though may be there still are some advices for my situation. I have a small project which demonstrates the work of a search engine. In the indexing phase, I have a filter method to filter out unnecessary things from the keywords. Its herep  precodebool Indexerfilterstring ampkeyword       Remove all characters defined in isGarbage method     keyword.resizestdremoveifkeyword.begin, keyword.end, isGarbage  keyword.begin       Transform all characters to lower case     stdtransformkeyword.begin, keyword.end, keyword.begin, tolower       After filtering, if the keyword is empty or it is contained in stop words list, mark as invalid keyword     if keyword.size  0  stopwords.findkeyword  stopwords.end         return false      return true  codepre  pAt first sign, these functions alls are member functions of STL container or standard function are supposed to be fast and not take many time in the indexing phase. But after profiling with Valgrind, the inclusive cost of this codefiltercode is ridiculous high 33.4. There are three standard functions of this filter take most of the time for that percentage codestdremoveifcode takes 6.53, codestdsetfindcode takes 15.07 and codestdtransformcode takes 7.71.  p  pSo if there are any thing I can do or change to reduce the instruction times cost by this filter like using parallellizing or something like that, please give me your advice. Thanks in advance. p  pUPDATE Thanks for all your suggestion. So in brief, Ive summarize what I need to do is 1 Merge codetolowercode and coderemoveifcode into one by construct my own loop. 2 Use codeunorderedsetcode instead of codesetcode for faster codefindcode method. Thus Ive chosen codeMarkBcodes as the right answer.p

I cannot utilize the already used ids, and classimga p0 doesnt work where p0 just holds the backgroundposition, becoming p1, p2, p3 .. for each image position.p  pThanks in advance for any advice.p  precodea.imga0 backgroundurl..imagessprite.png norepeatbackgroundcolortransparent   displayblockwidth24pxheight24pxbackgroundposition288px 0  tick green  a.imga1 backgroundurl..imagessprite.png norepeatbackgroundcolortransparent   displayblockwidth24pxheight24pxbackgroundposition312px 0  cross grey  a.imga2  .....  and so on. codepre

Negative 4747 pFirst of all, I am a beginner when it comes to C programming. Yesterday I encountered something rather strange. I was trying to determine the length of an array via a pointer pointing towards it. Since emsizeofem didnt work I did a little Google search and ended up on this website where I found the answer that it was not possible. Instead I should put an out of bound value at the last index of the array and increment a counter until this index is reached. Because I didnt want to overwrite the information that was contained at the last index, I tried putting the out of bound value one index after the last one. I expected it to fail, but for some reason it didnt.p  pI thought that I made a mistake somewhere else and that the array was longer then I assigned it to be, so I made the following testp  precodeint a[4] a[20]  42 stdcout ltlt a[20] codepre  pThe output is 42 without any errors. Why does this work This should not be valid at all, right Whats even more interesting is the fact that this works with any primitive type array. However, once I use a stdstring the program instantly exists with 1.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 4747 pI have a problem with Androids Fragment states. I have a fragment with 3 seekbars in it. At the bottom of the fragment there is a button, with which you proceed to the next fragment using a fragmenttransaction. Now, this nextbutton is disabled when the fragment is first created. I want the user to first use the 3 seekbars before they can proceed to the next fragment. This all works fine. However, in some cases the user can go back to the previous questionfragment by using the back button. Unfortunatly, when I hit the back button the nextbuttons state is set to disabled again. To me this is very strange because as far as I know Android should automatically store the state of the views. As a matter of fact Android does store the state position of the seekbars.p  pWhy does Android stores the state of the seekbars but not the state from the button The button is disabled in XML, so Im not changing it programmatically in the onCreate or something like that.p  pAnyone knows why Android cant remember the state enableddisabled of the button Its driving me nuts for days now...p  pemBTW I did try to use the onSaveInstanceState method and store the buttons state within the bundle, but the onSaveInstanceState method is never even called so the bundle is always empty in the onCreateemp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pA bit of my code. First, the way I enable the button works finep  precodepublic void onStartTrackingTouchSeekBar seekBar      seekBar.setTagtrue   public void onStopTrackingTouchSeekBar seekBar            if happyBar.getTag.equalstrue ampamp relaxedBar.getTag.equalstrue ampamp awakeBar.getTag.equalstrue          nextButton.setEnabledtrue       codepre  pAnd this is the way I transit to the next fragmentp  precodeFragmentTransaction ft  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction ft.setTransitionFragmentTransaction.TRANSITFRAGMENTFADE ft.replaceR.id.fragmentcontainer, fragment ft.addToBackStacknull ft.commit codepre  pThe buttons initial state is set to enabledfalse in the XML.

Negative 4747 pI need to calculate the hourly running costs for my Amazon EC2 instances. This varies even between instances with same hardware configs instance types because I use different amazon images AMIs some plain windows server and some windows server with sql server both of them have additional costs compared with plain linux instancesp  pThe EC2 Java API has a describeInstances method which returns Instance objects with metadata such as instance id, instance type m1.smalllarge..., state running,stopped.. public ip, etc. p  pThis Instance object also has a .getLicense.getPool which according to the Java API should return The license pool from which this license was used ex windows. I thought this is were it may also give windowssqlserver or something to that effect.p  pThe getLicense method does however return null..p  pIve navigated around the EC2 web console, not being able to find this information, but Im hoping that it is possible  otherwise it would mean that you cannot identify the true hourly cost of an particular instance unless you know which AMI was used to create it in the first place plain windows server or windows server with sql server.p  pAnyonep  pThanks p  pGeirp
Negative 4747 pI have an UpdatePanel which I am using to replace the content inside of the page. Outside of the UpdatePanel I have some jQuery using the codeoncode function to assign some button clicks. From my understanding a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comon relnofollowthe new jQuery.on syntaxa is meant to replace both event handlers and the old codelivecode functionality. The codelivecode function was supposed to monitor changes to the page and attach events to any element added to the page, yet this does not happen with the codeoncode function in my test pages. If I open up the console and run the same function after the UpdatePanel has changed then the event handler works correctly.p  pHere is what I have javascript wisep  precodefunction       .results.onclick, function           this.children.explination.slideToggle       codepre  pThe UpdatePanel is a simple UpdatePanel with a MultiView in it.p  pI am aware that I can use the Microsoft Ajax codePageRequestManagercode to handle this but it seems like it should be unnecessary if the events bound like I believe they are supposed to. I will use it for now, but I am curious whether I am doing it incorrectly or whether jQuery and ASP.Net are not working together.p  pOne theory I have is that, for whatever reason, the UpdatePanel is some how not firing the DOM update triggers that jQuery is using to capture changes and fire off the on event again.p

Negative 4747 pIm using jQuery UI tabs and the validation plugin together. Im validating on the click event of a span acting as a pseudo button. Ive only added the validation classes to the form elements visible on the first tab. Also there is one form for the whole page. When I click the button while viewing the first tab, the validation works, however if Im viewing a different tab, clicking the button causes the code to be executed even though the inputs on the first page arent valid.

Negative 4747 pim trying to add scheduling to my backend in llvm to prevent data hazards. The backend is very similar to microblaze but with a lot of differences such as multiple delay slots for branching delays.

Id like to know how to get a list of the compiled instructions from llvm during the compilation process to sort the instructions and check for dependencies based on registers used.p  pIm currently clueless on this since im not a skilled C programmer.

Negative 4747 pI have an SSRS report with information about invoices my company has issued with things like amount, date, payment, amount due, etc. Im using SSRS 2008 not R2 in Visual Studio 2008 environment. My issue has to do with formatting the report using the Expression editor. Currently, an invoice will be formatted as silver if the invoice has an Amount Due a column over 0.01 outstanding invoice. We also issue credits negative amounts and these are almost always the negative amount of a previous invoice. p  pSo, an invoice that has a credit issued to it will still show as silver because its amount due  0.01. But if there is a credit issued to this invoice, its not actually outstanding and should be white. For example, if an invoice is 100.00, and there is a credit after for 100.00, the original invoices background color should be switched to white. p  pHeres where the code explanation comes in. I thought this was possible with custom VB code in the report, but it seems like the Expression editor in SSRS will not recognize my function as it says Unrecognized identifier. I googled this a bit, and most of the topics I came across said that it will show that but actually work anyway. Well, Im pretty sure its not working at all, because I put this in as my expression and got all white cells for a certain columnp    pcodeIIFFieldsAmountDue.Value gt 0.01,  IIFCode.HasCreditFieldsAmountDue.Value  True, Blue, Silver, Redcodep  pThe HasCredit function is below. p  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodeFunction HasCreditByVal currentAmt as Double As Boolean  Dim i as Integer Dim amt as Double Dim amts as System.Collections.ArrayList  New System.Collections.ArrayList Dim negativeAmt as Double Dim retValue as Boolean  False  i  0  For i  1 to Report.ParametersTest.Count     amt  Report.ParametersTest.Valuei     amts.Addamt Next  negativeAmt  currentAmt  1  If amts.ContainsnegativeAmt Then     retValue  True End If  Return retValue End Function codepre  pWhen these two pieces are run, I get white background for all cells of this column. I read something on the net saying that only Shared functions would work, but I found multiple other examples showing functions that were not shared that worked. When I make it shared, it gives me codeBC30369 Cannot refer to an instance member of a class from within a shared method or shared member initializer without an explicit instance of the class.code due to the Report.ParametersTest.Count line. I got the idea for using Report.Parameters from a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSsqlreportingservicesthreada7d592240ee5491e883b2e5fcb3edeab relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSsqlreportingservicesthreada7d592240ee5491e883b2e5fcb3edeaba. p  pSo to reiterate, what Im basically trying to do is get the values of each cell in this column into a collection and, for any two amounts where one amount has a negative equivalent, give it a white background instead of silver.

Negative 4747 pThis code prices bonds according to the a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.co.ukhelptoolboxfinfixedfitsvenssonirfunctioncurve.html relnofollowfitSvenssona function. How do I get Matlab to ignore NaN values in the CleanPrice vector when a date is selected for which some bonds have a NaN entry for a missing price. How can I get it to ignore that bond altogether when deriving the zero curve It seems many solutions to NaNs resort to interpolation or setting to zero, but this will lead to an erroneous curve. p  precodeMaturitygcm3.data.CouponandMaturity136,2  [r,c]findgcm3.data.CleanPricedatenum11May2012 rowr  SettleDategcm3.data.CouponandMaturityrow,3 Settle  repmatSettleDate,[lengthMaturity 1]  CleanPrices transposegcm3.data.CleanPricerow,2end CouponRate  gcm3.data.CouponandMaturity136,1 Instruments  [Settle Maturity CleanPrices CouponRate] PlottingPoints  gcm3.data.CouponandMaturity1,2gcm3.data.CouponandMaturity36,2 Yield  bndyieldCleanPrices,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity  SvenssonModel  IRFunctionCurve.fitSvenssonZero,SettleDate,Instruments ParYieldSvenssonModel.getParYieldsMaturity codepre  pThe Data looks like this where each column is a bond, column 1 is the dates and the elements the clean price. As you can see, the first part of the data contains lots of NaNs for bonds yet to have prices. After a point all bonds have prices but unfortunately there are instances where one or two days prices are missing.  Ideally, if a NaN is present I would like it to ignore that bond on that date if possible as the more curves generated irrespective of number of bonds used the better. If this is not possible then ignoring that date is an option but will result in many curves not generating.    img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGhSYM.png altCleanPrice datap
Negative 4747 pFirst of all sorry if this was already asked and sorted out. I really did a hard search and cant able to find a better solution.p  pRequirement We are developing an Android application where we need to upload the video files to a folder in the web server. The web server is running in PHP.  The video files are very huge in size more than 10 MB.  And the web server is hosted on a shared hosting server where they have PHP upload limit as 2MB.p  pI hope my requirement is very clear to understand.p  pWe struggled for several days and found apache FTP could solve our problem.  After having few sleep less nights, we able to done the upload via FTP.  The problem in FTP is if the data Internet  3G goes down then the FTP is stopped and it is not resuming after the data Internet  3G is available.p  pNow we are back to square 1.  Searching again how to upload large files from android device to PHP server.p  pI need your advice on this.  Kindly help.p  pThanks amp Regards Malaip

Negative 4747 pFirst of all, please forgive me if I use the wrong terminology or I have a flaw in my understanding of the basic concepts. Im just learning how to build scripts that use classes... and am a relative newbie to Pythoncoding. p  pIn principle, Im interested to know if there is a way of calling the same func twice in a class. If I briefly explain what I am trying to do it might make some sense... p  pI am trying to write a web scraper that parses a seeded webpage, returns URLs based on some given parameters, follows those URLs, does the same thing potentially n times and finally returns a pdf at the bottom of the link. This is for speeding up some content collecting my colleagues currently do manually. I have saved literal person months of manual effort with my relatively basic previous iterations.p  pThis is a method I currently use, but the code I wrote is not really scaleable or easily reusable, and I want to try and make it more versatile Im currently hand rolling the script for each instance. p  pI think I want to build a class called siteInstance that I use to hold the seed url, save locations, titles, up, cookie and the various funcs. that I use to walk through the site to get to the target content. p  pThere is a repeated function I use that parses the target URL and returns the next layer URLs. These are based on some site specific RegEx, so I know I will have to feed the search filter regEx for each layer of URLs. I would like to be able to reuse the parser, but feed it with the layer specific Regex. DRY is a thing right p  pIn my mind, this means I have a func called siteInstance.parser, that I construct a number of within each siteInstance.class e.g. codesiteInstance.parserAcode for layer one, codesiteInstance.parserBcode for layer two ... codesiteInstance.parserncode for the nth layer   p  pFollows is a simplified version, in reality there is a number of cleaningpreparation steps at each layer to result in the correct generation of a list of target URLs for the next layer. This includes making of a file structure for saved binaries, writing logs, and firing the RegEx for that layer etc. p  pThis is a two layer example, but I know of instances that have at least 4 layers to content with.p  pExample Seed  codeURLwww.journalTitle.comcodep  pResult of first pass Layer1 code[IssueURL2010www.journalTitle.com2010,IssueURL2011www.journalTitle.com2011,IssueURL2012www.journalTitle.com2012,IssueURLnwww.journalTitle.comn]codep  pFor IssueURL2010 Layer 2 code[article12010URLwww.journalTitle.com20101,article22010URLwww.journalTitle.com20102,article32010URLwww.journalTitle.com20103,articlen2010URLwww.journalTitle.com2010n]codep  pFrom codearticle12010URcode I can get codewww.journalTitle.com20101.pdfcodep  pI hope this makes sense... p

Negative 4747 pI have stumbled upon this problem many times, mostly solved it with hacks, but would like to see a proprer way to do it.p  pIm writing a communication protocol, very similar to RPC in a way that my endpoints ask queries, to which they receive replies.p  pNow... I would like to implement a function, called SendCommand, that would send out a query, and wait for the reply to that question, and return it.p  pSo I could do something likep  precodeint outsidetemp  SendCommandWhat is the temperature outside.ToInt codepre  pThe problem with this is that the messages are send and received asynchronously, and I am notified by events that a new message has arrived, and what it was. I would need to block the thread until the reply to the mentioned query has arrived, extract its data content, and return it to the caller.p  pMy problem is with blocking the thread. Blocking the thread is not a problem, we are talking about a multithreaded app, so the UI would not freeze, etc., but the question is what is the correct way to achieve thisp  pIm thinking something along the line of initializing a semaphore inside the SendCommand function, waiting for it, and release the semaphore in the message received event handler after checking it was the correct messagep  pRegards,   axos88p

Negative 4747 pI developed a small c program in Visual Studio 2012 on Windows7, 64bit lets call it PC1. On that pc it runs finep  pSince I didnt have a versioning control system like SVN at hand, I copied ALL the project data the exact folder structure, DLLs, source files, project files... to a usb stick and moved it to another computer. On that other engine theres Visual Studio 2010 on Windows7, 64bit PC2.

It appears to be conflicting with a preexisting jQuery flipper.  My fancybox works perfectly, but in IE and Firefox it breaks the flipper Chrome and Safari are fine.  Most of the solutions I see here involve changes at a level to which I dont have access.  For example I cant make any changes to the preexisting flipper code.

Negative 4747 pI want to Create a Framework , like Admin panel , which can rule almost all the aspects of what is shown on the frontend.p  pFor an eg Most basic one If suppose the links which are to be shown in a Navigation area is passed from the server, with the order and the url , etc.p  pThe whole aim is to save the time on the tedious tasks. U can just start creating  Menus and start assigning pages to it. Give Url, Actual files which are to be rendered in case of static files., In case of dynamic files , giving the file accordingly. And this is fully server side manageable using different portlets, sort of things.p  pSo basic Roadmap is having p  pstrongAreas like strong p  pstrongHeader Area strong Which can contain logos , links etc.p  pstrongNavigation Area strong Which can contains links and submenus.p  pstrongContent Area strong Now this is where the tricky part is that that It has Zones like  Left , Center amp Right. It contains Order in which it has to be displayed. So, when someday we want to change the way the articles appear on the page, we can do so easily, without any deployments. Now these Zones , can have n no of internal elements, like the word cloud , or the advertisment area.p  pstrongFooter Area strong Again similar as Header Area.p  pCurrently there is a Framework already existing, this is using XSLT files for pulling out data from server sides. For an eg If theres a Grid it will be having a  tag embedded in the XSLT file. Now whatever might be the source of the data , we serialize this as XML and give it to the XSLT file and the html is derived from this and is appended to the layer in a page. p  pThe problem with this approach is  p  ol liThe XSLT conversion is occurring on the server side, so the server is responsible for getting the data , running XSLT transform, and append the html generated to the layer div. So, according to me firstly this isnt the servers concern to do so. Secondly for larger applications this might be slower.li liDebugging isnt possible for XSLT transformation. So, whenever we face problems with data its always a bit of Trial amp Error method.li liMaintaining it is a bit of an eerie job i.e. styling changes, and other stuff. li liAdding dynamic values. Like the JavaScript cant be actually very easily used in this. Secondly, we cant use JQuery or any other libraries with this since this is all occurring onto the server.li ol  pFor now what i have thought about is using Templating  Javascript  JSON combination at the place of XSLT , this will be offloaded to the client and the rendering will take place accordingly. p  pWhat could be other ways to implement a Custom CMS   p  pWhat could be the problem with JavaScript based approach   p  pAre there any existing frameworks for similar usage  p

Negative 4747 pI am rotating some pages in a HTML document so that in the same document some pages are printed in portrait and some are printed in landscape. This is easy to do in current browsers using CSS3 transform rotate. However, I also need to support IE6 where the previous method doesnt work.

This uses this on the main div for each page which all other page content is embedded inp  precode    filter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix             M113.061515884555943e16,             M121,             M211,             M223.061515884555943e16,             SizingMethodauto expand codepre  pThis works okay in IE6 in that it correctly rotates the required pages in the document and as far as layout goes, it prints correctly. However, the quality of the printout on these rotated pages is substandard. Unlike the CSS3 solution which prints perfectly. I could understand the degradation if I was scaling the page or using an angle other than 90,180 or 270 degrees but Im not.p  pThe pages consist of tables with text. All text is lowered in quality but especially the bolded text.p  pIs there any way of keeping the qualityp  pNote Ive already tried rotating it using BasicImage which produces exactly the same result.p

Negative 4747 pI am trying to open the serial COM PORT in a Win32 Application. The port is opening correctly but I can send a receive bytes just if I previously opened it using Teraterm or Hyperterminal.p  pIf I deactivate and activate the COM port from Device Manager so the port is freshly unused I need to simply open the COM port with Teraterm or Putty and afer I closed it  and then run my software I can send and receive properly at anytime. p  pI am using Embarcadero X3 with FileMonkey to make the application compatible with MACOSX and Win32 at the same time. FileMonkey does not suuport VCL.p  pThe same code is working fine on Builder 6 c using VCL but it should not influence it in anyway. My code is really simple.p  pThis is a very weird behavior. Seems like I need to INIT the COM I am using FTDI converter before I can use it and when the PC restarts or I deactivate and activate back the COM from Device Manager it seems this INIT is vanished and I simply need to open up the COM to revive it using another Serial Software and then use my software.p  pNote Once the port is INIT I have the full control from my software. I am sure my code is truly opening the COM port because the COM appears busy once the iNIT is done if I try to use it with other softwares. So no flase alarm and more the application is working on the other side so far.p  pI have this problem since long and I now decided to solve it p  pThis is my codep  precode GLOBAL VARIABLES HANDLE hComm  NULL COMMTIMEOUTS ctmoNew  0, ctmoOld  DCB dcbCommPort        hComm  CreateFileCOM2,                        GENERICREAD  GENERICWRITE,                       0,                       0,                       OPENEXISTING,                       0,                       0      ifhComm  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE                ApplicationgtTerminate            GetCommTimeoutshComm,ampctmoOld     ctmoNew.ReadTotalTimeoutConstant  100     ctmoNew.ReadTotalTimeoutMultiplier  0     ctmoNew.WriteTotalTimeoutMultiplier  0     ctmoNew.WriteTotalTimeoutConstant  0     SetCommTimeoutshComm, ampctmoNew     dcbCommPort.DCBlength  sizeofDCB     GetCommStatehComm, ampdcbCommPort     BuildCommDCB115200,N,8,1, ampdcbCommPort     SetCommStatehComm, ampdcbCommPort codepre

Cons The OS is burdened with additional functionality.p  pI am clearly lacking understanding of something here, because I dont see what the difference would be. In the end, I dont see what the difference is between making a browser part of the operating system, or making is separate. I suppose I dont really understand what it means to be part of the operating system.

Negative 4747 pNot sure if this is an appropriate question for SO, but here goesp  pI am interested in the required logic needed to be able to calculate the highest and lowest possible finishing position of a team in a league.p  pTake for example the English Premier League. There are 20 teams in this league. Each team hosts every other team in the league once at home. This means that each team plays each other twice once at home and once away, and so will play 38 games in a season.p  pA game can end in one of three results a home win, a draw, or an away win. Teams are awarded 3 points for a win, and one point for a draw. This means that the maximum amount of points a team can achieve in a single season is 114 383.p  pThe bottom of this years Premier League table currently looks like this Position, Team name, Games played, Goal difference [goals scored  goals conceded], Points p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjfGe9.png altPremier League as at 14513p  pI want to know Newcastles highest and lowest possible finishing positions.p  pIt would be rational to think that Newcastles lowest finishing position this season would be 18th, as if Newcastle lose their remaining game, and all the teams below them with the exception of QPR and Reading who cant catch Newcastle win their games, then their points total will be higher than Newcastles Wigans will be the same, but the fact that they will have had two wins, and Newcastle will have had one loss will mean that Wigan will have a superior Goal Difference [the mechanism to separate teams who are on equal points].p  pemHoweverem and this is the complicated bit Aston Villas final game of the season is against Wigan. For this reason, it is impossible for both teams to gain maximum points.p  pSo my question is which is the best way to accurately determine the highest and lowest possible finishing place of a given team in a league, whilst taking into account the remaining fixtures of rival teams Should I just look at every remaining fixture and calculate each permutation Or is there a smarter way to do this  p

Negative 4747 pI would like to ask a few question about texture encoding and loading pvr.ccz file in Android. Im using Cocos2dx Game Engine.p  ol lipI cant load pvr.ccz file with texture encoding format PVRTCv2 and PVRTCv4. But, I can load it with RGBA 8888, RGBA 4444, etc. Ive checked cocos2dx source. It just doesnt allow Android to load with those two encoding format. I would like to know if there is any workaround to load for those two encoding format in Android. pli lipIve changed the pvr.ccz file encoding to RGBA 8888. And it can be loaded in both iOS and Android. But, the problem is when the pvr.ccz file is larger than approximately 2.4 MB, Android cant load it again. In memory usage, its telling me that the size of pvr.ccz file is even larger than 16 MB. Maybe its because Android decompress pvr.ccz file. I would like to know if there any workaround for that memory issue in Android.pli ol  pIm using Samsung Galaxy Tab P7500 to test and I assume it use PowerVR GPU. It should be ok with PVRTCv2 or PVRTCv4. But, in the source of cocos2dx, its not checking anything related to GPU. It just dont allow Android to load PVRTCv2 or PVRTCv4. Our Game is using too many Graphic, if we are using RGBA 8888, the size of the game would become around 40 MB while the size would be only 18 MB when we use PVRTCv2.p  pAny Suggestion would be Appreciate  ..

The work around I see is using a query that displays the properties of the instance rather than the instance itself.p  pCurrent Resultp  precodehttpassignment3.stdi.msmsuhail.eadbpl.owlArsenal codepre  pExpected Result p  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltrdfDescription rdfabouthttpassignment3.stdi.msmsuhail.eadbpl.owlArsenalgt     ltbplhasStadiumLocation rdfdatatypehttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemastringgtHollowayltbplhasStadiumLocationgt     ltrdftype rdfresourcehttpassignment3.stdi.msmsuhail.eadbpl.owlClubsgt     ltrdftype rdfresourcehttpwww.w3.org200207owlNamedIndividualgt     ltbplhasStadiumName rdfdatatypehttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemastringgtEmirates StadiumltbplhasStadiumNamegt     ltbplhasPlayer rdfresourcehttpassignment3.stdi.msmsuhail.eadbpl.owlTheoWalcottgt     ltbplhasPlayer rdfresourcehttpassignment3.stdi.msmsuhail.eadbpl.owlMikelArtetagt     ltbplhasName rdfdatatypehttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemastringgtArsenalltbplhasNamegt     ltbplhasNumberSeats rdfdatatypehttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemaintegergt60355ltbplhasNumberSeatsgt     ltbplhasManager rdfresourcehttpassignment3.stdi.msmsuhail.eadbpl.owlArseneWengergt     ltbplhasPlayer rdfresourcehttpassignment3.stdi.msmsuhail.eadbpl.owlAaronRamseygt ltrdfDescriptiongt codepre  pSPARQL Queryp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT  clubs clubName  WHERE      Club bplhasPlayer players.

Negative 4747 pSuppose I have the following command in bashp  precodeone  two codepre  pNow suppose that codeonecode runs for a long time producing a stream of output and codetwocode performs a quick operation on each line in the stream, but codetwocode doesnt work at all unless the first value it reads tells it how many values to read per line. Also suppose that codeonecode does not output that value, but I know what it is in advance. I cannot modify codeonecode or codetwocode.p  pMy first thought was to dop  precodeecho echo 15 one  two codepre  pWhich gives me the correct output, but it doesnt stream through the pipe at all until the command codeonecode finishes. I want the output to start streaming right away through the pipe, since it takes a long time to execute months.p  pI also triedp  precodeecho 15 one  two codepre  pWhich, of course, just outputs 15 to stdout and then fails to pass it through the pipe to codetwocode.p  pIs there a way in bash to pass 15n through the pipe and then start streaming the output of codeonecode through the same pipep

Negative 4747 pI am trying to build a simple application for managing a database most likely sqlite of members of a society. The resulting app needs to be useable on windows and OSX and ideally be packaged as a single file.p  pMy plan was to use a single HTML file that embeds all the javascript needed within the same file, which would be stored on the users computer. The user could then simply doubleclick and open the page in their favourite browser, where the JS would be executed to handle the user interactions with the database and so on. On first running the sqlite database would be created on the users machine which would persist the data and could also be backed up as needed.p  pMy question is, how can I go about creating and modifying the database file from within the browser Traditionally this has been a big nono for obvious security reasons but looking into things like app.js and others I feel like there might be another option for achieving this simply. An option might be to have a saveload dialog if nothing else. The key factor is to avoid having the user install any extra dependencies like node.js etc, as this is a very simple tool. p

It has the following signaturep  precodevoid AssertPropertyValuesltTEnumerable, TElement, TPropertygt   TEnumerable enumerable,    FuncltTElement, TPropertygt propertyPointer,    params TProperty[] expectedValues    where TEnumerable  System.Collections.Generic.IListltTElementgt codepre  pWhat this means is, that it takes the following inputp  ol liAny object that is enumerable, and contains objects of the same Type as the intput for 2.li liA Func usually encapsulating lambda expressions that takes an object of the same Type as the contents of 1 and returns an object of the same Type as the Type of the contents of the array provided in 3.li liAn array of objects of the same Type as that of the output of the Func in 2.li ol  pSo, an actual execution of this method could look like thisp  precodeAssertPropertyValues   item.ItemGroups,    itemGroup gt itemGroup.Name,    Name1, Name2, Name3 codepre  pAt least, that is how I would like it to look like, but I run into the well known compiler error The type arguments for the method X cannot be inferred from the usage., and that is what I do not understand. It should have all the info needed as far as I can see, or perhaps it is another version of the Covariance and Contravariance problemp  pSo for now I am forced to do it like this insteadp  precodeAssertPropertyValues   item.ItemGroups,    ItemGroup itemGroup gt itemGroup.Name,    Name1, Name2, Name3 codepre  pCan anyone point out why this scenario can not be inferred by the compilerp
Negative 4747 pI have codeUIScrollViewcode loaded with codeUIButtonscode and on codeUIButtoncode action I have highlighted codeUIImagecode of each codeUIButtoncode.p  pIf I dont set codedelaysContentTouchescode as codeNOcode then highlighted codeUIImagecode of codeUIButtoncode will not shown if I touch up codeUIButtoncode very fast. After I set codedelaysContentTouchescode property as codeNOcode then only codeUIButtoncode highlighted codeUIImagecode is shown.p  pNow after setting codedelaysContentTouchescode property as NO for codeUIScrollViewcode. I can not scroll my codeUIScrollViewcode by dragging on the codeUIButtonscode. Now how can I resolve this issue. p  pPlease give me an advise.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4747 pSQL Server 2008R2  ReadCommitted Isolation Level p  pI am trying to work out exactly when SQL server will convert an update lock to an Exclusive lock. For example I have the table dbo.TableA. dbo.TableA has two Columns PKCol1 and NCCol2. PKCol1 is a clustered index and NCCol2 has a Nonclustered index on it. If I were to execute p  precodeBEGIN TRAN    DELETE FROM dbo.TableA  WHERE NCCol2  1  COMMIT TRANSACTION  codepre  pAnd the optimiser chose to scan NCCol2 to find all candidate records, would the nonclustered index operator scan all records in the index. Adding an update lock to each candidate record until it had scanned the entire index, before the clustered index delete operator then converted those locks to exclusive locks and deleted. p  pOr would the nonclustered index operator scan each record in turn adding update locks to candidate records, evaluate if the row was a match and if it was convert the update lock to a exclusive lock. p  pBasically which operator converts the update lock to an exclusive lock, the nonclustered index scan once the scan has identified that the record is a match or clustered index delete once candidate rows have been identified and passed to it p  pBooks online tells me p  pUpdate Up  pUsed on resources that can be updated. Prevents a common form of deadlock that occurs when multiple sessions are reading, locking, and potentially updating resources laterp  pand p  pExclusive Xp  pUsed for datamodification operations, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. Ensures that multiple updates cannot be made to the same resource at the same time.p  pstrongAdditional Information 1strongp  pI was actually investigating a deadlock which occurred on the nonunique nonclustered INT Index2 below after the optimiser chose the following plan p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwwC9d.jpg altNonClustered Index Scan The deadlock translated as p  ol liVictim took an update lock on dbo.Table1 Index2 row1 li liOwner took an eXclusive lock on dbo.Table1 Index2 row2li liVictim waited for an update lock on dbo.Table1 Index2 row2li liOwner waited for an update lock on dbo.Table1 Index2 row1li ol  pIt was my understanding that each operator in an execution plan was executed in its entirety in order from right to left top to bottom. But also my understanding that an update lock was only converted to an exclusive lock during an UPDATEINSERT or DELETE i.e. the clustered index delete operator. Because of this I was unsure why the owner in step 2 had an exclusive lock on Index2 row2, which would suggest that it was at the clustered index delete step, but was still waiting for an update lock which would then suggest that it was also the nonclustered index scan step. How could it be at both steps at the same timep  pHowever if you think that both update and exclusive locks are taken during the index scan then this deadlock would make more sense.     p  pAfter a recompile the optimiser chose to seek on the clustered index with no problemsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFQe4c.jpg altClustered Index Delete Bogdan Sahlean amp brian  many thanks for your help and advice.p
Negative 4747 pI have been testing an IOS app on multiple platforms and have observed some weird behaviours while testing on the iPhone 4S.  The app crashes after performing a task that works on both the iPhone 5 and iPhone 3S.  When the crash happens there is nothing displayed on the debugger, absolutely no crash log or memory warnings appear in Xcode.  I isolated the block of code, and the specific line responsible for the crash.  I still dont understand why it is happening or how to find a solution.  The code is part of a larger method that downloads a number of images and displays them in UIImageViews.  Here is the codep  precodefill image tiles with images for int i  0 i lt [objects count] i      PFObject imageObject  [objects objectAtIndexi]     PFFile imageFile  PFFile [imageObject objectForKeyimage]     UIImageView imageHolder  UIImageView [self.view viewWithTag100  i]      imageHolder.image  [UIImage imageWithDataimageFile.getData]  codepre  pThe code loops through an object that has been loaded with image files from a server. The UIImageViews that each image is meant to be assigned to are tagged from 100  104, so they can be accessed with the loop index variable.  The line codeUIImageView imageHolder  UIImageView [self.view viewWithTag100  i]code extracts the UIImageViews from the main view.  In the next line the imageHolder view is assigned an image, this is the line that causes the crash, and when commented out the view loads without fail.  I havent been able to determine why this is happening or if it is the imageFile or imageHolder view that is not being set up properly.  Perhaps someone here can shed some light on the problem.p

I later then manually look at this data and if I decide an IP or range of needs blocking I would then take manual action.p  p2 Block anyone accessing my site by using the server IP address e.g. 123.55.44.222 instead of the actual domain.com domain name. I want to do this as it messes up the site no doubt this could be resolved by changing my code, but nobody enters the IP so its easier to do this.p  pWith this I want a piece of code to detect if they are using the IP and just block them immediately maybe return a 403 errorp  pThanks.p

Negative 4747 pI already did everything to run my webservice on IIS and it is working. IIS Pool is listening to port 81, and i did port fowarding from port 8081 to port 81 inside my network, aiming for my server. When i type a hrefhttpfoo.com8081WebServiceName.asmx relnofollowhttpfoo.com8081WebServiceName.asmxa it returns my web service page to consume my WebMethods. So I choose one my WebMethods, fill the parameters, and when i press Invoke Button, it changes the URL Address to a hrefhttpfoo.com81WebServiceName.asmxWebMethodName relnofollowhttpfoo.com81WebServiceName.asmxWebMethodNamea, and since port 81 should not receive any external request, its does not respond.p  pWhat am i doing wrong, or missingp

Negative 4747 pOk, so I am having a small problem, more of an annoyance. And it brings up a question of why sublime text is acting this way.

So I am hoping that someone has an explanation for me. Or is this a bug in sublimep  pHere are some things I know 98 certainty are strongnotstrong the problemp  ol liThe tab trigger part, when I use the tab trigger it works minus this one thing. No other tab trigger competes with this one. I changed the trigger to complete mumbojumbo and I can see that it recognizes it without conflict of other triggersli liThe scope. I am sure that alot of you will think that there is no source.sass scope, but I have added one after the fact, so my sublime has one. I have tried it with no scope, and it has the same problem. So its not that.li liThe highlighting order, I removed these, and i had the same problem.li liI have tried changing the original tab level to see if somehow the tab order was causing a problemli ol  pSo alas, here we are. I have troubleshot it and I think it has to do with the  in front. When I remove the dollar sign i get predefaultboxshadowcolor 333333pre which is close, except that compass needs that dollar sign and the whole point of the snippet was to make my life easier.p  pIs there a way to character cancel the  is this a known issue Am I doing something wrong or should I bring this up with the devs of sublime I would like to just be able to use this if I could. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 4747 pIve been using Toad for more than a year now without problems. All of a sudden the table autocomplete feature has ceased working.

Negative 4747 pI wish to read the EUI64 address from an AT24MAC602 memory chip interfaced to an Atmega128rfa1 MCU over the Two wire interface. I tried to modify the I2C master drivers which are available for other platforms to suit my need. However, I wasnt able to carry out these modifications successfully as the program stopped responding as soon as the slave address was written to the twi bus with Write flag set. I failed to uncover the underlying reasons for the same.  As Contiki OS is quite popular, i thought someone might have already come up with contiki specific libraries for reading writing over TWI interface for Atmega128rfa1 MCU. If so, please provide pointers to the twi drivers or documentation for the same, or suggest factors that should be considered for developing such drivers. Thank you.   p

As what I feel may be hardest is if they entered random294 it wouldnt convert it to 294, but to 28. If they entered foo then it would exit1.p  pMy general questions are these Instead of making multiple postsp  pWhen making codeconverttointcode I know I shouldnt use codeatoicode because it doesnt fail right. Some people say to use codestrtolcode but it seems tedious to convert it back to a nonlong int. The simplistic read shortest way Ive found is using codesscanfcodep  precodeint i if sscanfstring, d, ampi  1     return i  codepre  pHowever, some people look down on that even. What is a better method if not sscanf or converting strtolp  pSecondly, how can I not only return an integer but also know if it found one. For example if the user entered 0 then it would return 0, thus setting off my FALSE in my if statement. I had considered using 1 if not found but since I am returning signed ints then this also suffers from the same problem. In PHP I know for example with codestrposcode they use code FALSEcodep  pFinally, is there any short code that emulates associate arrays andor lets me push elements on to the array in runtimep

Negative 4747 pIve recently had an issue where I have a web service asmx file where clients can access the wsdl through an https address, such as a hrefhttpsexample.addresswebservice.asmxwsdl relnofollowhttpsexample.addresswebservice.asmxwsdla. When adding a web reference to Visual Studio, it tries to access a hrefhttpexample.addresswebservice.asmxwsdl relnofollowhttpexample.addresswebservice.asmxwsdla  which returns a 404 error as the server is not configured to allow nonsecured access. This also occurs in SSIS when adding a web service reference, or web service task even when a certificate is added.p  pIn Visual Studio, Im also able to add it as a service reference which generally works except for double[] being changed to ArrayOfDouble, etc., but it doesnt appear that service references are an option in the Visual Studio provided within SSIS.p  pIve searched around for this quite a bit and there seems to be no easy solution to force https to be used. Instead, Im wondering if there is a way to import wsdl references into a project manually without adding it as a web reference just to add the request methods. That way I can create my own https SoapClient that uses these methods without the web reference issue.p

Each point in a set must be matched to emat leastem one point at the other set, in a way that the sum of the length of the lines drawn by joining those points should be as low as possible.

Negative 4747 pIve GAE application which creates some data in the Google Cloud Datastore and stores some binary files into the Google Cloud Storage  lets call the application strongWebAppstrong. Now I have a different application running on the Google compute engine. Lets call the application strongComputeAppstrong.p  pThe strongComputeAppstrong is a backend process which is processing data created by the strongWebAppstrong. I asked here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21502396communicationwithdatastoreandcloudstoragefromgooglecomputeengineinjavin this questiona previously which API can I use to communicate with Datastore from the strongComputeAppstrong. As suggested by proppy, I implemented the strongDatastorestrong communication using of the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comdatastore relnofollowGoogle Cloud Datastore APIa. p  pEverything works fine as far as Im communicating with the Datastore in the Google cloud. Im using the service account authentication.p  pNow I need to run my ComputeApp locally, on my development PC so Ill take data created by my local strongWebAppstrong and stored into the local debug Datastore. I need it because I want to have a testing environment so I can debug may GAE app locally.p  pHow should I modify my strongComputeAppstrong code to force it to strongconnect to my local debug Datastorestrong instead of connect to the Google cloudp  pI googled a lot and didnt find any advice nor example.

Negative 4747 pI have an issue where forms are validated and if do not pass validation validation is done in the backend are re displayed with original submitted data for the user to change. Originally this was not huge as I could just pass param data back into the template and have it redisplayed to the user. However, I came across issues with getting dropdowns and check boxes to retain the submitters original choices.p  pI checked out some of the Dancer friendly modules that did form validation and they seem nice, however, I have one more constraint The forms and data selected needs to be able to be rebuilt and displayed again at a later time. So that means the data will need to be retrieved and the form built again displaying the same information previously selected, dropdowns already preselected, checkboxes checked, and data with the inputs.p  pI do not mind generating the forms and their selections dynamically from the backend using CGI form generating methods, but how can I get that data to play nice with dancer and display inside of a templatep

Negative 4747 pemstrongUPDATEemstrong not solved yet, but part of a solution. See below.p  pI am attempting to connect my iPod or other smart device to my laptop Kubuntu 13.10 via bluetooth and stream a2dpencoded music to a bluetooth speaker. Never mind why I dont connect them directly. I had a lot of trouble getting the devices to actually pair then connect at the same time, but now Im able to do that. There are a million posts out there that describe different ways to connect BT headsets by changing .asoundrc, etcbluetoothaudio.conf, and loading a loopback module through PulseAudios controller.  However, I could never get PulseAudio to consistently load the sources and sinks, so I scratched that idea and started following this great post by James B a hrefhttpjamesbond3142.noip.orgblogviewCatBluetooth relnofollowhttpjamesbond3142.noip.orgblogviewCatBluetoothap  pI got the code compiled. It uses the newer DBus API for BlueZ. Following his instructions, I was able to pipe music into the a2dp server or out of it, but there is no sound. In the code, he waits for two DBUS methodcalls, SelectConfiguration and SetConfiguration in order to obtain the transport, which I think is a handle or file descriptor that describes where the audio should go tofrom. However, the handlers for these events are never called. I set up dbusmonitor to listen on the system bus for these calls using this guide a hrefhttpswiki.ubuntu.comDebuggingDBus relnofollowhttpswiki.ubuntu.comDebuggingDBusa. However, the method calls dont show. Then again, I tried listening to ANY method calls on the system bus and there are some that dont show in dbusmonitor that I know are being called. i.e. RegisterEndpointp  pI see signals from org.bluez, but no method calls.

Negative 4747 pI am working on a server component which is responsible for caching models in memory and then stream any changes to interested clients.  p  pWhen the first client requests a model well model key, each model has a key to identify it the model will be created along with any subscriptions to downstream systems and then sent to the client, followed by a stream of updates generated by downstream systems.  Any subsequent clients should get this cached updated model, again with the stream of updates.  When the last client unsubscribes to the model the downstream subscriptions should be destroyed and the cached model destroyed.  p  pCould anyone point me in the right direction as regards to how Rx could help here.

Negative 4747 pI am having a really weird issue related to codescrollingcode a codeUITableViewcode.p  pI have a codeTableViewcode populated with a codecollectioncode of codeMPMediaItemscode songs in an album. In IB, I have an codeUIImageViewcode that is intended to show an codeindicatorcode if the song is stored in the cloud. When the codeTableViewcode codecellcode is populated, I check if the song is codeiCloudcode, if not the codeUIImageViewcode is removed entirely and if so then the codeImageViewcode is assigned an codeimagecodep  precodeUIImageView isCloudIcon  UIImageView [self.view viewWithTag105]  if [[rowItem valueForPropertyMPMediaItemPropertyIsCloudItem] boolValue]  NO      [isCloudIcon removeFromSuperview]  else if [[rowItem valueForPropertyMPMediaItemPropertyIsCloudItem] boolValue]  YES      isCloudIcon.image  [UIImage imageNamediCloudIcon.png]  codepre  pThis displays initially just fine, but its also where the weirdness starts. If emallem songs are stored locally, everything works just fine. Likewise if emallem songs are stored in the cloud, everything works. But if it is a combination then it will display correctly initially, but as you codescroll upcode andcodedowncode, the codeiCloudcode icon codeimagecode views begin to magically disappear. Just through playing with it, Ive been able to determine that it is related to bouncing scroll. Every time the TableView bounces on scroll it removes an codeImageViewcode, seemingly for no reason. Turning off bounce solves the problem, but this is jarring and Id prefer to leave it in.p  pHas anyone encountered behaviour like this Thanks in advance.p
Negative 4747 pEDIT I delayed the execution of Core.createBot using a ScheduledWorker to resolve the problem.p  pSo I made an IRC Bot using Java and Im now rewriting him to be controllable through a GUI. If a user issues a command through that, the bot sends a message to the channel saying who issued the command.

I saw a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangMath.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangMath.htmla that the math class square root method returns a double. I experimented with it in eclipse with some ints that have whole square roots  4, 9 and found that the square root with those always returned a floating point value with one decimal  4.0, 9.0. I was curious as to why it even returned that extra decimal I thought that ints could be considered as double values too.

Negative 4747 pIm working with the Kinect 2.0 and in particular with the color stream.  The color stream arrives with a whooping 19201080 resolution, which is great Except, I intend to capture the image bytes and write them to disk.  So, the most viable solution for me is to compress each image frame and then store the compressed image rather than the raw high resolution image.p  pI have a solution but I feel its a bit of a round the houses way of doing this.  p  pBasically, I get the raw pixels, write them to a WriteableBitmap and then compress the ImageSource using the following two methodsp  p1 Write to WriteableBitmapp  precodethis.colorBitmap.WritePixels                 new Int32Rect0, 0, this.colorBitmap.PixelWidth, this.colorBitmap.PixelHeight,                 this.colorPixels,                 this.colorBitmap.PixelWidth  intthis.bytesPerPixel,                 0 codepre  p2 Compress this to jpegp  precode        public static byte[] CompressToBytesImageSource src, int compressionrate                                        var enc  new JpegBitmapEncoder             enc.QualityLevel  compressionrate              var bf  BitmapFrame.CreateBitmapSourcesrc             enc.Frames.Addbf              using var ms  new MemoryStream                              enc.Savems                 return ms.ToArray                       codepre  pWhich works fine, as I said, but I think it would be much better if I could get the raw pixels from the Kinect and then directly compress byte array rather than writing to a WriteableBitmap and then compressing that.  Just seems like an extra step.p  pBTW, this is the code I use to grab the bytes from the color framep  precode    using ColorFrame colorFrame  e.FrameReference.AcquireFrame              if colorFrame  null                      FrameDescription colorFrameDescription  colorFrame.FrameDescription              if colorFrameDescription.Width  this.colorBitmap.PixelWidth ampamp colorFrameDescription.Height  this.colorBitmap.PixelHeight                              if colorFrame.RawColorImageFormat  ColorImageFormat.Bgra                                      colorFrame.CopyRawFrameDataToArraythis.colorPixels                                  else                                      colorFrame.CopyConvertedFrameDataToArraythis.colorPixels, ColorImageFormat.Bgra                                             codepre  pBaring in mind that when working with the color stream at all the number of frames per second you are able to capture drops, from say 3032 to 2629 roughly, I want to use the most efficient way.p  pOne thing Ive noticed that when searching for compression solutions in c, is that a good percentage of articles are aimed at storing a single image to disk.  Whereas I need this compression to be carried out in memory, as I am writing multiple images to disk using a binary writer.p

Negative 4747 pstrongFinal Edit  Solved  Solution Belowstrongp  pI cant believe that I didnt know this, but apparently the issue was that the table variable and the real table both had the same name  CHECKERS and dbo.CHECKERS.  The trigger was apparently confusing the two.  I discovered this by changing the order of the insert and update operations in the trigger such that the insertion to the real table happens after the update from the table variable.  Suddenly, the updates began passing without issue.p  pOf course, I only created dbo.CHECKERS to debug CHECKERS, so clearly some original problem existed which started this all but regardless, the problem has been resolved and the trigger works just fine.  Im posting it below, so feel free to offer any feedback if you wish.  Im not an expert clearly, and am always happy to receive constructive feedback. p  pThanks everyone for your help and comments.

To ensure that the table variable is getting values and that they are available for use, I added a new table to the test database and at each fire of the trigger I insert the values currently contained in the table variable to the new table, like thisemp  precode        DECLARE CHECKERS AS TABLE            OrderNum INT,             OldDCB INT,             NewDCB INT,             OldMC INT,             NewMC INT,             OldQT NUMERIC28,3,             NewQT NUMERIC28,3                   INSERT INTO CHECKERS         SELECT  I.OrderNo,                 D.DriverCB,                 I.DriverCB,                 D.MCode,                 I.MCode,                 D.Quantity,                 I.Quantity         FROM Inserted I         JOIN Deleted D ON I.OrderNo  D.OrderNo         WHERE I.OrderKind  0         AND D.DriverCB ltgt I.DriverCB             OR D.MCode1 ltgt I.MCode1             OR D.Quantity ltgt I.Quantity          INSERT INTO CHECKERS         SELECT  OrderNum,             OldDCB,             NewDCB,             OldMC,             NewMC,             OldQT,             NewQT         FROM CHECKERS          An actual table created to check functionality          Works up until this point          UPDATE Orders         SET Quantity2  CASE                  WHEN NewQT gt 0 THEN NewQT                 ELSE Quantity2                 END         FROM CHECKERS C         WHERE OrderNo  C.OrderNum codepre  pemNaturally, there are many more updates in the actual trigger, but you get the idea.em  p  pemAny ideas why the update to Orders doesnt go through Probably something small, silly, and embarassing  but again I say, whatever  Thanks.emp  pemEnd Original Postemp  p Editp  pI have also tried writing the update as suchp  precode        UPDATE O         SET Quantity2  CASE                  WHEN C.NewQT gt 0 THEN C.NewQT                 ELSE Quantity2                 END         FROM CHECKERS C         INNER JOIN Orders O on O.OrderNo  C.OrderNum codepre  pThis approach gives the same result No error message or any other message, for that matter, and no update...p  p 2nd Editp  pstrongIf I use the actual table CHECKERS rather than the table variable CHECKERS, the update passesstrongp  precode            UPDATE O             SET Quantity2  CASE                      WHEN C.NewQT gt 0 THEN C.NewQT                     ELSE Quantity2                     END             FROM CHECKERS C  Actual table, not a table variable             INNER JOIN Orders O on O.OrderNo  C.OrderNum codepre  pstrongThis also works regardless of the presence of Orders in a JOINstrongp  precodeUPDATE Orders             SET Quantity2  CASE                      WHEN C.NewQT gt 0 THEN C.NewQT                     ELSE Quantity2                     END             FROM CHECKERS C  Actual table, not a table variable             WHERE OrderNo  C.OrderNum codepre  pThe only problem now is that, in the customers database, I cannot add the real table CHECKERS.  I added it in my test database only to clarify whether or not the values were passing into the table variable Is this a restriction of table variables that I am not familiar with Im having a hard time finding any such limitation in the online documentation...p

Negative 4747 pI am using googles static chart enging yup, I know its deprecated to create a chart with both a bar and a line. The values from the bar are shown in the left axis..

Negative 4747 pIve inherited a functional but messy WPF MVVM application. To my annoyance, there were virtually no unit tests which makes the adoption MVVM somewhat pointless. So I decided to add some.p  pAfter grabbing the lowhanging fruit, Im starting to run into trouble. Theres a lot of highly interdependent code, especially inside the properties and methods that are used in the Views. Its common, for instance, for one call to set off a chain of property change events which in turn set off other calls and so forth.p  pThis makes it very hard to test, because you have to write enormous mocks and set up a large number of properties to test single functions. Of course you only have to do it once per class and then reuse your mock and ViewModel on each test. But its still a pain, and it strikes me this is the wrong way to go about things. It would be better, surely, to try and break the code down and make it more modular.p  pIm not sure how realistic that is in MVVM. And Im in a vicious circle because without good tests, Im worried about breaking the build by refactoring to write good tests. The fact its WPF MVVM is a further concern because nothing tracks the interdependence between View and ViewModel  a careless name change could completely break something.p  pIm working in C VS2013 and grabbed the trial version of ReSharper to see if it would help. Its fun to use, but it hasnt so far. My experience of unit testing is not vast. p  pSo  how can I approach this sensibly, methodically and safely And how can I use my existing tools and look at any other tools to help p

Negative 4747 pI wonder how I can use the data from a database received via Socket.io from a Node.js server for a data visualisation with d3. Ive read some posts about using PHP and JSON for that. Do I really need JSON And how can I do this without the need of PHP Actually the data received from Socket.io is already stored in the array codevaluesarraycode. But this array is not accepted by d3.

Negative 4747 pI am working on a program that loads usercreated plugins using dlopen on CentOS.  I am running into a problem with a plugin that has dependencies on shared libraries that also have dependenciesp  plibplugin.so  libservices.so  libconfig.sop  pOur program loads the dependencies into memory first, starting at the leaves of the dependency tree and moving up to the plugin, error checking omitted in this examplep  precodedlopenpathtopluginlibconfig.so, RTLDNOWRTLDGLOBAL dlopenpathtopluginlibservices.so, RTLDNOWRTLDGLOBAL dlopenpathtopluginlibplugin.so, RTLDNOWRTLDGLOBAL codepre  pWe use this approach so the end user does not have to modify their LDLIBRARYPATH to point to the directory with the plugins.  This approach has worked successfully for several different plugins.p  pWe recently received a new plugin for which this approach does not work.  We are able to load libconfig.so successfully, but when we try to load libservices.so, we get the following error messagep  precodeException libconfig.so cannot open shared object file No such file or directory codepre  pI know that the symbol dependencies between libraries are all satisfied, because when I set LDLIBRARYPATH to contain the plugin path, the plugin loads and executes correctly.p  pWhen I run strace on my program, I can see that the system is performing a search for libconfig.so as described in the dlopen man page.

In particular, I can find the zeros, min, max, etc of the function over any interval I specify. p  pI am translating this code into python, mostly as an exercise in learning python, and I was wondering if there is anything similar perhaps in numpy that I could use, instead of setting up a numpy array with an arbitrary set of h values to process over. p  pI could do something like pseudocodep  precodef  numpy.arraythat function for h in numpy.arangehmin, hmax,hstep codepre  pbut this commits me to a step size. Is there any way to avoid that and get the full precision like in matlabp  pEDIT what I actually want at the end of the day is to find the zeroes, max, and min locations not values of the function f. It looks like scipy might have some functions that are more useful here a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipyreferenceoptimize.html relnofollowhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipyreferenceoptimize.htmlap

Negative 4747 pI am working on unit tests for code that deals with the File System Events API.

When I try to put the test files somewhere like codetmpcode or the location of codeNSTemporaryDirectorycode, the listener does not receive any events.

Negative 4747 pIm just wondering what happens when passing an invalid Date into JavaScripts Date Object and the passed date was invalid.p  pe.g. 20151131 Not valid because November only has 30 Daysp  pHere an examplep  precodenew Date20151131T235959.999Z.toISOString  Results in 20151201T235959.999Z codepre  pOk the date seems to be interpolated and a comparison in a different language Objective C is particular similar.p  pBut when I try the following examplep  precodenew Date20151132T235959.999Z.toISOString   It results with an Error Uncaught RangeError Invalid time value codepre  pAnd compared to Objective C its now different because Objective C results with p  precode20151202T235959.999Z codepre  pWhats the reason for this behavior and which one is more correctp
Negative 4747 pI am looking for a way to create a tooltip which changes its value based on the section the mouse is hovering over. p  pFor example When mouseover A, the tooltip displays 1. When mouseover B, the tooltip displays 2.p  pSo far I have implemented a tooltip which appends a fixed string. But this will show the same string for all sections.p  pI have used the following codep  precode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt  ltheadgt ltscript typetextjavascript src

Negative 4747 pMorning guys.p  pI made a Label Generator in Excel, on which I converted the items chosen in dropdown lists to leters which translate to these items chosen.p  pThis convertion is quite simple.p  precodeIf tipoChosen  UTP Then tipo  U End If codepre  pThis happens for every user input about the label.p  pI also had to add a number that made each label different, so I made this linep  precodeFinalLabel  tipo amp forn amp FormatNextrow  2, 00000 amp . amp Color amp  amp metragem amp  codepre  pWhere the FormatNextrow  2, 00000 Would give me a number depending on which row it was, beggining in 00000 and going through infinity and beyonduntil long capacity ended. This worked and I was happy with it.p  pMy boss just told me that what I did was wrong, and that it needs to reset this number for each type of cable. Meaning thatp  blockquote   pif all the other parameters stay the same, it keeps counting.p      pIf it changes it goes back to 00000p      pIf it goes back to whatever type I already used, it keeps counting from the previous number.p blockquote  pAnd I honestly have no clue on how to do this the way I made my code. Will I need to do it from scratch and work my way around this Or is there a way to implement this feature as it isp  pEdit I also have numerical inputs, things such as the lenght of the cable, thing that will change the label. Meaning that there needs to be a check to see if that lenght was also used before. Remember thatp  blockquote   pif ALL parameters are identical, keep counting from 00000 to whatever labels are to create. lets say 00100p      pif something changes it starts from 00000p      pif it goes back to a previous used combination of parameters it KEEPS counting from whatever number it was previously. meaning the next one would be 00101p blockquote

They united in the late 1990s under one love rock n roll. The band is famous for their renditions of rhythm n blues hits, country ballads and 60s popular music. While Ward 4 is a quintet, the original lineup consisted of four members John, who also took on lead vocal duty, Richard, Phil and Glen. After the later addition of the charismatic Marty Gee, the band saw no reason to change the name which had already gained them a reputation of a fantastic live act, and thus remained Ward 4, rather than 5 ltpgt                 ltpgtWard 4s main frontman, Marty G lives and breathes 50s rock and roll immediately evident in his pop attire, slickedback hair and sharp voice.

Negative 4747 pHello Im trying to achieve adding optional properties to each product. So I have model Properties where is stored the name of the property like color or size. Next model is PropertyValue where is stored specific colors or sizes which is belongs to Property. p  precodeclass Product lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany properties   hasmany propertyvalues, through properties end  class Property lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto product   hasmany propertyvalues end  class PropertyValues lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto property end codepre  pI have already created in every model properties and property values for each property. My idea is that when I will be product edit I will use nestedform. There will be select box for each property.

I tried many solutions with models but still cant find the right solution. Thank you for all hints and sorry for poor english.p

Negative 4747 pI am creating a rest webservice using spring RestController and HttpMessageConverter. p  pIt is working fine for simple scenario where my controller method is returning some POJO and spring converts it to JSON using MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter as belowp  precode      firstName John,      lastName Smith,   codepre  pHowever properties name in JSON is same as the name of getters in my POJO. I want to modify the name of properties in my JSON dynamically.p  pActually the requirement is to modify the JSON property names based on a logic. E.g if condition X then properties name in JSON should be as belowp  precode      fName John,      lName Smith,   codepre  pIf Y then properties name in JSON output should be something else likep  precode      MainName John,      SecondName Smith,   codepre  pSo the property name cannot be tied to pojo and I also cannot use jsonproperty as that would be compile time but i want to change at the runtime.p  pIs there a way to override MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter and put my logic to decide json properties name therep

Negative 4747 pIve bougth an IP camera. I then, discovered that it uses a standard called ONVIF. I searched about it and saw that its a good way to put all the cameras in the world to be implemented in the same way.p  pOf course Ive read the ONVIF specification PDFs. What I understand about how it works, is the followingp  pThere is a WSDL file that describes how the camera or another thing can be accessed. Like, which settings can be modified, which methods are accepted, and so. When I read this WSDL file, Ill choose a method and send a type of message called SOAP, which will be a XML containing the response to some method on the WSDL file. SOAP is a XML that can go over HTTP so it can go through firewalls, but also can be sent over other protocols.p  pSo, as I understood, if I want to tell my camera to start streaming video, I just need to find the WSDL method that describes how to initiate a stream, and then send a SOAP message to tell it that I need to start a video stream over some protocol, at some port. Then, I can read and decode the stream.p  pBy knowing this simple example I gave, I could do other things, like, control the camera and so. I dont know the public for which the PDFs at ONVIF are directed for, but I couldnt understand it enough so I could explore my camera. For example I dont know how to receive this WSDL file. Ive read somewhere that I should access a hrefhttpipofcameraonvifdeviceservicehttpipofcameraonvifdeviceservicea to get the file, and then I should send a SOAP message to it and watch the response.p  pI even tried to analyse the packets via wireshark, but theyve seem nonsense to me. It was difficult because I couldnt even make my camera work with iSpy software. It only works perfectly but with no audio or talk in my android app, so Ive set up a proxy at my raspberry pi and then analyzed the packets.p  pCould somebody give me a basic example of how to receive the WSDL file, and then how to call one method of it I wanted to see how it works in a network level, but I can only find how to call libraries in C that are ready to deal with it.p  pFor example I wanted to know what I need to send through TCP or over TCPHTTP to the camera, and how to initate a stream. All of this in network level, no code needed at all.p  pIm just trying to learn here, but this doesnt seem like a real open standard. Its very hard to understand if you never programmed anything like it. So I guess those PDFs are for people who work with it. I know how TCP and UDP works and how to send raw messages by them, so its all a question of finding a good resource with examples, so I can understand what ONVIF is really about. p  pCouldnt the internet unite to make it more clear Why there are no posts about itp  pThanks, amazing community lt3p

Negative 4747 pI have been working on malarial cell recognition in wholeslide images in matlab. My reference paper is this  a hrefhttpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed23218914 relnofollowhttpwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpubmed23218914a.  My overall process for adpating the method to wholeslide images looks like this 1 I have a training set of 10 each of infected and normal cell images. I extract 49 features and arrange them such that a given feature from all 10 images is a field in the struct variable called feature. e.g codeinfectedfeaturecode is a struct that contains 49 fields for 49 features. 2 from this set of feature, I compute the mannwhitney U statistic for feature ranking and arrange the fields of the struct codeinfectedfeaturecode and codenormalfeaturecode according to the rank in the structure variables coderankedinfectedcode and coderankedrbccode respectively. 3 Now, I select one feature at a time and train the svm as followsp  precodefields  fieldnamesrankedrbc  get field names for i11lengthfields     suppvec  [rankedrbc.fieldsi, rankedinfected.fieldsi] training data created by concatenating the feature array of infected and rbc     suppvec  doublesuppvec     grouping  [ones1,lengthrankedrbc.fieldsi 2.ones1,lengthrankedrbc.fieldsi] grouping variable 1 defines normal and 2 defines infected     trainstruct.fieldsi  svmtraindoublesuppvec,grouping end codepre  pThus, each field of codetrainstructcode contains the trained svm of each feature.p  p4 Now i use this to classify a test set of 10 images each of infected and normal samples one image at a time of infected and normal together as followsp  precodefor n1110 loop through the number of samples  10 [infecttestlist,testfeatureNumber]  featurebuildinfecttestfeatures,1 extract features of infected image [rbctestlist,testfeatureNumber]  featurebuildrbctestfeatures,1 extract feature of normal image loop thorugh each of the features to classify the image for i11lengthfields if isfieldrbctestlist,fieldsi  testvecinfect  infecttestlist.fieldsi get infected test vector  testvecinfect  doubletestvecinfect  outinfect  [outinfectsvmclassifytrainstruct,testvecinfect] classify using respective svm as infected or not   testvecrbc  rbctestlist.fieldsi get normal test vector  testvecrbc  doubletestvecrbc  outrbc  [outrbcsvmclassifytrainstruct,testvecrbc] classify using respective svm as normal or not end end end codepre  p5 Now, when i run the classification, it is not able to classify the images properly. It is able to identify normal samples only 17 of the times. By literature standards, it is too low. Also I am getting variable classification accuracy. When I use one image as test and 3 features, the results are like 77 accuracy in classifying infected cells and 80 accuracy in classifying normal cells. But when I increase it to the whole set of 10 imageseach of infected and normal and 49 features for classifying each each image, I am getting the 17 accuracy for classifying normal cells and 90 accuracy in classifying infected cells.p  pHave I arranged the features properly i.e is correct if i group a given feature of all 10 training images as one training feature Is it fine if I feed 1D vectors for training the svm Where else am I going wrongp
Negative 4747 pI am developing a strongstatelessstrong Agent in strongJavastrong that takes informations from one Server and transfer it to another client. It means that the agent is located between a client and a server. So I am thinking to run two threads strongsimultaneouslystrong on the agent one thread thread1 runs a serverSocket and get request from client while another threads thread2is runnning and makes communication with the server. The problem consists in synchronizing between the two threads. I am thinking in making thread 1 asking whole the time thread 2 about a new Information. If thread 2 has nothing new, he will not answer it. What is the best way to synchronize between them. Should I use a global variable a flag to synchronize between them Can I save Information when I have a stateless agentp

Negative 4747 pI am trying to extend the handsontable plugin to support multiple selections in its dropdown list. I have already tried extending the base Editor built into the library by modifying the dropdownEditor as suggested  a hrefhttpsgithub.comtrebuchettyHandsontableselect2editorissues7httpsgithub.comtrebuchettyHandsontableselect2editorissues7a. I spent hours reading and searching through the source for keywords but I am not coming up with anything of real use.p  pI do not mind if this is answered using the Angular extension or another native ECMA5 or 6 way of extending the a hrefhttpsgithub.comhandsontablehandsontablehttpsgithub.comhandsontablehandsontablea plugin.p  pSo far my only thoughts were to actually extend the framework with this bit of code following the patterns that exist. I added all LOC below that are pointing to multiselect or Handsontable.MultiselectDropdownCell copied the dropdown method, called the new name and everything works, however still cannot see where I could begin to find what I am looking for.p  precodeHandsontable.MultiselectDropdownCell    editor getEditorConstructormultiselectdropdown,   renderer getRendererautocomplete   Handsontable.cellTypes     text Handsontable.TextCell,   date Handsontable.DateCell,   numeric Handsontable.NumericCell,   checkbox Handsontable.CheckboxCell,   autocomplete Handsontable.AutocompleteCell,   handsontable Handsontable.HandsontableCell,   password Handsontable.PasswordCell,   dropdown Handsontable.DropdownCell,   multiselect Handsontable.MultiselectDropdownCell   Handsontable.cellLookup   validator      numeric Handsontable.NumericValidator,     autocomplete Handsontable.AutocompleteValidator  codepre  pI have at a modified version of dropdown editor in place that looks like p  precodeimport getEditor, registerEditor from ...editors.js import AutocompleteEditor from .autocompleteEditor.js     private   editor MultiSelectDropdownEditor   class MultiSelectDropdownEditor   dependencies AutocompleteEditor   class MultiSelectDropdownEditor extends AutocompleteEditor    preparerow, col, prop, td, originalValue, cellProperties      super.preparerow, col, prop, td, originalValue, cellProperties     this.cellProperties.filter  false     this.cellProperties.strict  true      export MultiSelectDropdownEditor  registerEditormultiselectdropdown, MultiSelectDropdownEditor codepre  pAt this point I have no clue where the click event is happening when the user selects an item from the dropdown list. Debugging has been painful for me because it is through Traceur. I tried setting a click event after the module is ready and the DOM is as well however I cannot get even an alert to fire based off of a click on one of the select dropdown cells. The normal cells I can get a click with a simplep  pcodebody.onclick,handsontable td, someAlertcodep  pHowever not so for the menu contents. Right clicking to inspect the dropdown menu means first disabling the context menu like the one on a hrefhttphandsontable.comhttphandsontable.coma. Then you will notice that right clicking to inspect anything will fire an event that closes the dropdown menu you are trying to inspect.p  pIve put breakpoints all through the libraries source code, I cannot figure this one out. p  pThe only thing I want to do is figure out where the part of the code that highlights the menu item and sets it to an active selection, turn that into a method that accepts multiple selections up to the entire array of options available, clicking an active item will disable it lets just say. p  pThen ensuring that those selections are actually in the Handsontable data scope. p  pThats it, I dont need it to even render in the cell what things have been chosen, although any help there would be great because unfortunately, I am yet to find the spot when the options in the dropdown are rendered either.p  pI have also tried using the Select2Editor made for handsontable as seen a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4mpyhbjw40httpjsfiddle.net4mpyhbjw40a and a hrefhttpsgithub.comtrebuchettyHandsontableselect2editorissues3httpsgithub.comtrebuchettyHandsontableselect2editorissues3a , however it does not help my cause much.

Negative 4747 pI am searching for a design patternway to exchange a persistence layer of my application dynamically preferably even at runtime.p  pstrongWhystrong p  pId like to be able to decide whether to save certain data to XML or a database on a per instancebasis.

I like my single responsibility so Id rather delegate that to the models instead, likep  precodetrait PersistenceLayer      def getAllmodel Model Seq[Model]   model.getAll    trait Model      def getAll Seq[Model]   package SQL  class Apple extends Model      def getAll Seq[Apple]    do some SQL magic here    package XML  class Apple extends Model      def getAll Seq[Apple]    do some XML magic here instead   codepre  pNow the big problem here is, even if I implement a concrete PersistenceLayer, like sop  precodeobject SQLPersistenceLayer extends PersistenceLayer  codepre  phow could I tell the application to use the model of the right packagep  pIf I use the SQLPersistenceLayer uponp  precodeval apples  myPersistenceLayer.getApple  codepre  pI would need to import the right Apple class, which defeats the whole purpose because then I could just remove all other classes, import the right one and just use a generic getAll method on it. p  pSo again I would need to change the implementation at multiple lines, which is what I want to avoid.p  pI thought about something like giving a string with the packagename, likep  pval package  sql and in the controller to import it from the right package, but this is not really feasible and not really easy to accomplish and its a rather nasty hack for something Im obviously missing.p  pstrongTo make a long story short I want to be able to switch the package to use for my persistence needs emdynamicallyem.

Negative 4747 pWe have what I believe to be a pretty standard form based authentication for a web application running on wildfly 8.2.p  pThe authentication works well, except that when we stopampstart the server some users are unable to log in again.p  pI have managed to reproduce one variant of this If I open the login page, xxxxapp, before I restart, and then try to log in after the server is up again, I end up on a blank xxxxjsecuritycheck page.

Negative 4747 pI made an application that copy directory from one location to another, the application and the copy process works fine when I try to copy from an external hard disk to the computer, from the computer to an external hard disk, from an external hard disc to another one and from the computer to the computer. Today I ran some tests on my application and weird thing happened. I have an external hard disc that includes the C volume from my previous computer, when I tried to copy it to another computer the application copied directories and files from the destination computer. For example, when the application try to copy the users folder it gets and copy the users from the destination computer and not from the volume on the external hard disk. My application uses a recursive function that gets all the sub folders and the sub files from the selected path but somehow when it try to get  and copy the users folder from the external hard disk volume it copy the users folder from the destination computer C volume. I checked the paths and everything is fine. What is the problem and why the application could not regonizecopy from the external hard disk volumep
