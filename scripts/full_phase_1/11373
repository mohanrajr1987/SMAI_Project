Positive 11373 pI created some retinaquality icons for my tab bar, because when I create them small enough to fit in the tab bar they look like crap on the iPhone 6.  Anyway, thats fine, because I just use the image edge insets for each UITabBarItem in interface builder to get them the right size in the app.  When I do, my retina icons look great.  However, whenever you tap a button, the edge insets are just completely thrown out the window and the icon expands to its normal large size, never to return again.  Not to mention, if I keep clicking on an already selected tab bar item, the icon just starts to appear in weird stretched states.

When I add all of the constraints I want it tries to change the width of the scrollview to be a lot smaller. It is constrained 2 points from each side of the super view yet it is trying to change the width, which will break my constraints. At run time it follows the width suggested by interface builder and is smaller. How can I get this view to follow my constraints and not have the width shrinkp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoqm1C.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoqm1C.png altenter image description hereap  pEdit Figured it out.

Positive 11373 pRemember typical situation we have UIButton, we have some event triggered by something in our case let it be UITouchUpInside AND some IBAction somewhere for example in our UIViewController that will be called when event occurs. IBAction is created by controldragging from my button inside my view controller. p  pNow image another situation I have some custom class, some event occurs inside it AND I want some IBAction to be performed when my custom event in my custom class occurs. To be more specific, I want to connect object to my view controller in storyboard, then controldrag from one of my events from created object  to my view controllers IBAction exactly like I did for UIButton and UITouchUpInside. In other words probably I need some kind of selector  to be set up from storyboard to call later. p  pThe whole point of all it is to quickly drag from events in my custom class into another place to create and later call IBAction, so please do not mention delegation of any form.p
Positive 11373 pIm using Swift and Xcode 6.4 for what its worth.p  pSo I have a view controller that will be containing some multiple pairs of UILabels and UIImageViews.

Im aware this could be translated into a UITableView, but for the sake of learning please bear with me. This is turning out to be a more convoluted process than I imagined it would be, Im having trouble figuring out the right way to make this all work in IB. p  pCurrently Ive been floundering around with a UIView subclass and corresponding XIB, overriding initframe and initcoder, loading the view from the nib and adding it as a subview.

Strangely none of these articles or previous answers on stack overflow mention this p  pOk so I put a check in initcoder to see if the subview had already been added. That solved that, seemingly.

Negative 11373 pGreetings,p  pIve been writing some nasty code to support the undoredo of deletion of an arbitrary set of objects from my model. I feel like Im going about this correctly, as all the other mutators addingcopypasting are subsets of this functionality.p  pThe code is nastier than it needs to me, mostly because the only way to mutate the model involves calling beginInsertRowsbeginRemoveRows and removing the rows in a range just doing 1 row at a time, no need to optimize neighbors into a single call yetp  pThe problem with beginInsertRowsbeginRemoveRows is that removal of a row could affect another QModelIndex say, one cached in a list. For instancep  precodeParentObj    gtChildObj1    gtChildObj2    gtChildObj3 codepre  pSay I select ChildObj1 and ChildObj3 and delete them, if I remove ChildObj1 first Ive changed ChildObj3s QModelIndex row is now different. Similar issues occur if I delete a parent object but Ive fixed this by pruning children from the list of objects.p  pHere are the ways Ive thought of working around this interface limitation, but I thought Id ask for a better one before forging aheadp  ol lipMove backwards, assuming a provided list of QModelIndices is orderered from top to bottom just go from bottom up. This really requires sorting to be reliable, and the sort would probably be something naive and slow maybe theres a smart way of sorting a collection of QModelIndexes Or does QItemSelectionModel provide good ordered listspli lipUpdate other QModelIndeces each time an object is removedadded cant think of a nonnaive solution, search the list, get new QModelIndeces where neededpli lipSince updating the actual data is easy, just update the data and rebuild the model. This seems grotesque, and I can imagine it getting quite slow with large sets of data.pli ol  pThose are the ideas Ive got currently. Im working on option 1 right now.p  pRegards, Dan Op
Negative 11373 pHi A couple of friends was discussing the use of inheritance and how to check if a subclass is of a specific type and we decided to post it here on Stack. The debate was about if you should implement a abstract enum in the base class to be used for checking the type of the subclass, or if you should use the is operator. p  pAlt 1.p  precodepublic abstract class Document  public class PDFDocument   Check If myobj is PDF codepre  pAlt 2.p  precodepublic abstract class Document   public abstract DucumentType TypeOfDocument get  public class PDFDocument   public DucumentType TypeOfDocument  getreturn DucumentType.PDF   public enum DucumentType   PDF, Word   Check If myobj.TypeOfDocument  DucumentType.PDF codepre  pThe ones for Alt1. ment that Alt2 slightly breaks SRP, you dont take advantage of OO, Your repeating the abstraction. Since inheritance is the hardest connection between classes you cannot avoid knowing of them, and if you must go thru with inheritance minimize the impact. Alt2 also breaks DRYp  pThe ones for Alt2 ment that Alt2 will be removing type checking entirely and replacing it with the option of checking this enum instead. Removing all hard connections to all subclasses, and the value of the enum itself does not say anything about which concrete implementation thats currently beeing operated on.p  pWhats your opinion about the two alternatives p  pNo discussion of inheritance vs. composition etcetera, thats another questionp

The RTB will apply very simple formatting to the code blockit will change the font and apply a background color to the entire block, similar to what you see in the code block below.p  pChanging the font is pretty straightforwardp  precodevar textRange  new TextRangertb.Selection.Start, rtb.Selection.End textRange.ApplyPropertyValueTextElement.FontFamilyProperty, Consolas textRange.ApplyPropertyValueTextElement.FontSizeProperty, 10D  codepre  pNow I need to apply some paragraphlevel formatting. I need to set the paragraph margin to 0, so I dont get a blank line between code lines, and I need to set the paragraph background color. Heres my problem I cant figure out how to get the paragraph elements from the selection, so that I can apply formatting.p  pAny suggestions An example of how to apply the Margin and Background properties would be incredibly helpful. Thanksp

Negative 11373 pThis probably has an obvious answer, but Im a beginner.  Ive got a module really just a file with a bunch of functions I often use at the beginning of which I import a number of other modules.  Because I work on many systems, however, not all modules may be able to load on any particular machine.  To make things slightly more difficult, I also change the names of the packages when I import them  for example, matplotlib gets abbreviated to mp.p  pWhat Id like to do is only load those modules that exist on the system Im currently using, and do some error handling on the ones that dont.  The only way I can think of doing so is by enclosing each import statement inside its own try block, which seems pretty unpythonic.  If I enclose them all in the same try block, whichever module throws an error will prevent the subsequent modules from being loaded.  Any ideas that might make things look prettier  It would be so easy if I didnt want to change their names...p  pThanksp  pDavep

Negative 11373 pIm in the process of writing a custom heatmap generator. Im wondering what the fastest way is to draw boxes up to around 1 million in Java. Most questions Ive found have concentrated on dynamic images like in games, and Im wondering if theres a better way to go for static images. Ive tried using swing via a GridLayout and adding a colored canvas to each box, drawing directly on the panel with Graphics2D, and also by using the Processing libraries. While Processing is pretty fast and generates a clean image, the window seems to have problems keeping it it generates different parts of the image whenever you minimize, move the windows, etc.p  pIve heard of OpenGL, but Ive never touched it, and I wanted some feedback as to whether that or something else would be a better approach before investing time in it.p

Negative 11373 pIm working on a system that performs matching on large sets of records based on strings and numeric ranges, and date ranges. The String matches are mostly exact matches as far as I can tell, as opposed to less exact full text search type results that I understand lucene is generally designed for. Numeric precision is important as the data concerns prices. p  pI noticed that Lucene recently added some support for numeric range searching but its not something its originally designed for.p  pCurrently the system uses procedural SQL to do the matching and the limits are being reached as to the scalability of the system. Im researching ways to scale the system horizontally and using search engine technology seems like a possibility, given that there are technologies that can scale to very large data sets while performing very fast search results. Id like to investigate if its possible to take a lot of load off the database by doing the matching with the lucene generated metadata without hitting the database for the full records until the matching rules have determined what should be retrieved. I would like to aim eventually for near real time results although we are a long way from that at this point.p  pMy question is as follows Is it likely that Lucene would perform many times faster and scale to greater data sets more cheaply than an RDBMS for this type of indexing and searchingp

There was a failed attempt to port this code to Python. Pythons different overflow behavior turn out to be part of the problem. The code has many of those different idioms C, Perl, some python mixed in and those comments mixed in, so it was challenging.p  pEssentially, the image analysis being done is a disc based highpass filter to perform similar image comparison. Part of the highpass filter has an integerbased multiplication of two large polynomials. The overflow was essentially a dont  care, its big... kind of logic so the result was as intended with a Cbased overflow. So the use of Horners rule with Onsup2sup time was a waste since the larger polynomials would just be big  a roughjustice form of carottops saturation arithmetic. p  pChanging the loopbased polynomial multiplication to a form of FFT is probably significantly faster. FFT runs in close to linear time vs Onsup2sup for Horners rule polynomial multiply. Going from disc based to inmemory will also speed this up. The images are not terribly big, but the original code was written at a time when they were considered huge The code owner is not quite ready to trash his beloved code, so well see. The right answer for him probably is just keep Perl or C if he wants that code. p  pThanks for the answers. I did not know about Pythons decimal module, and that seemed to be closest to what I was asking  even though there are other issues to be solved in this casep

Negative 11373 pI just started looking into jQuery yesterday, before this I programmed in only PHP.

Negative 11373 pI have a question about something I still dont understand about unions. Ive read about a lot of their uses and for the most part can see how they can be useful and understand them.

Negative 11373 pI was reading this a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdevelopertechnicalArticlesALTserialization relnofollowarticlea about serialization.p  pIt was the first time I saw encrypting a serialized object. Im trying to encrypt some serializable object and then save them into a file. But the articles example uses ECB mode which is known to reveal informations about the encrypted plaintext. I was wondering, how is it possible to encrypt a serialized object by using CBC instead of ECB modep  pIn order to use CBC, an initial vector is needed. This vector must be saved with the serialized object, but if the vector gets encrypted then we cant find the vector in order to decrypt the object.p  pAlso, is it possible to say that the initial vector will be saved as plaintext in the file where the serialiazable object is saved. But then wouldnt the file be destroyedp  pAn example using CBC mode would be very useful.p

Negative 11373 pIm going to develop a big database for my company. This database will be the core element for future products. My first thought was that of using EF 4 creating a nice, objectoriented database with builtin inheritance concept. Then, I read lot of criticism against a database thought with objectoriented paradigm in mind. The database should be built on facts, and not on objects a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions190296howdoyoueffectivelymodelinheritanceinadatabasereferencea. And we need a database with great performance, first of all. For me, as a longtime C developer, it is quite difficult to think not in terms of object, since for me everything is an object. Could you suggest me articles, books or just blog entries to get back into the old tabular world of database, with performance in mind more than usability Then, I would like create an EF view out of it, because later I will need usability too, comprehensive of inheritance.p  pAny help appreciatedp

Negative 11373 pI recently stumbles across some problem with initializer lists. Consider a program that stores maplike datap  precodestruct MyMapLike    MyMapLikestdmapltstdstring, intgt data     datastdmovedata      private   stdmapltstdstring, intgt data  codepre  pThat looks straight forward. But when initializing it, it becomes ugly. I want to let it look likep  precodeMyMapLike maps    One, 1 ,  Two, 2   codepre  pBut the compiler doesnt want to accept this, because the above means that it should look for a twoparameter constructor that can accept code One, 1 code and code Two, 2 code respectively. I need to add extra braces, to make it look like a singleparameter constructor accepting the code  ... ,  ...  codep  precodeMyMapLike maps     One, 1 ,  Two, 2    codepre  pI would not like to write it like that. Since I have a maplike class, and the initializer has the abstract value of a mappinglist, I would like to use the former version, and be independent of any such implementation details like level of nesting of constructors. p  pOne work around is to declare an initializerlist constructorp  precodestruct MyMapLike    MyMapLikestdinitializerlistlt      stdmapltstdstring, intgtvaluetype     gt vals     datavals.begin, vals.end        MyMapLikestdmapltstdstring, intgt data     datastdmovedata      private   stdmapltstdstring, intgt data  codepre  pNow I can use the former, because when I have an initializerlist constructor, the whole initializer list is treated as one element instead of being splitted into elements. But I think this separate need of the constructor is dead ugly. p  pIm looking for guidancep  ul liWhat do you think about the former and latter form of initialization Does it make sense to be required to have extra braces in this caseli liDo you consider the requirement for addition of an initializer list constructor in this case badli ul  pIf you agree with me on that the former way of initialization is nicer, what solutions can you think ofp

Negative 11373 pI have a window called MAINWINDOW that has a toolbar and a frame. Inside the frame is shown a Page called HOMEPAGE. This page has a treeview where menu options are shown. When the user clicks a node, the corresponding form a Page is shown inside a border in HOMEPAGE, using the Border.Content property. I have a button in the toolbar to search for customers and I need to bind this buttons command property to a command which is defined inside the Customers pages viewmodel.

In other, more recent posts on Sencha Touch MVC, they have tutorials such as a hrefhttpwww.sencha.comlearnTutorial3aASenchaTouchMVCapplicationwithPhoneGapherea, as well as Mannings MEAP emSencha In Actionem by Jay Garcia that seem to rely on Ext.Dispatch in the views to call specific controller methods, passing additional elements to the controller, which makes the views controlleraware.p  pMy question is, which is considered the best practice to structure a Sench Touch MVC appp

Negative 11373 pI have been thinking of making an AI for a board game for a long time, and recently Ive started to gather resources and algorithms. The game is nonrandom, and most of the time, there lt 3 moves for a player, sometimes, there are 20 moves. I would like to store critical moves, or ambiguous moves so that the AI learns from its mistakes and will not make a same mistake the next time. Moves that surely win or lose need not be stored. So I actually have a sparse decision tree for the beginning of games. I would like to know how I should store this decision tree in a database The database does not need to be SQL, and I do not know which database is suitable for this particular problem. p  pEDIT Please do not tell me to parse the decision tree into memory, just imagine the game as complicated as chess.p

Negative 11373 pIm working on an application using the CakePHP framework and in the past I ran into a few encounters with encoding.p  pTo avoid these issues in my application, I started doing some research. But Im still a little confused about the how and why.p  pMy application will need to support all languages, yes even languages such as Chineese. Most of the data will be stored into a MySQL database, and thats where confusion starts. What should I use as collation p  pBased on what Ive read the past few days, I come to the conclusion the best choice for collation would be utf8unicodeci. Is this correctp  pNow onto the PHP, what would I set as encoding UTF8 I need to completely be sure not a single character shows up the way it shouldnt. Content will be submitted through forms, so the output has to be the same as the input.p  pI hope anyone can give me an answer to my questions and help clarify it to me, thanks in advance.p

Negative 11373 pI have a scrollview with an uiimageview represented as a tiled layer, it is a static map. I have an imageview for pin over it. when the user zooms in and out of the map, I need the pin to retain its position, and also increase in size proportionately so that it is still visible at a smaller zoomscale. I can see this happening seamlessly in google maps. When you zoom out, the pin changes size at the same time. I tried implementing the scrollviewdidbeginzoom and endzooming methods, hiding the pin when the user begins zoom and putting it back at a recalculated position at the end of it. But it does not appear elegant. Any pointers would be helpful, thanks.p

Negative 11373 pI have an application running in Qt that I am essentially trying to reskin. I was provided graphics to use for the background, buttons, etc. There are no current graphics in the project. It does not have a background and is just using the default look for QPushButtons. I am using Qts UI Design editor because it will not let me just modify the mainwindow.ui file outside of the editor. p  pSo I was able to set the background of the application by applying a stylesheet to the MainWindow object. codebackgroundimageurlpathtobg.pngcode and that worked. Cool. But now all of the QLabels in the application have the exact same background. It seems that all of the members of a QWidget inherit the stylesheet information of their parent. How do I stop thatp  pThe other thing I am experiencing is that I need to display graphics in random places on the application. The only way I have successfully done this is by adding another QWidget and setting the stylesheet to that. Is that a proper method What is the best way to display a noninteractive imagep  pThanksp
Negative 11373 pIn my java code formatter, in my profile I have actually its the eclipses default all choices in the braces tab set to same line.

Negative 11373 pI know you can disable the autocomplete on a form by setting codeautocompleteoffcode on the form itself. p  pThe problem I have is, I want to prevent the browser from populating the password field but do not want to disable username or other fields.p  pThe other thing to consider is legacy data. Using codeautocompleteoffcode on the form or even the field itself strongdoes notstrong prevent existing users with saved passwords from getting a freepass. Or ones that use web inspector, change the value of autocomplete and submit, allowing themselves to save the password. p  pI know it is possible to change the password field codenamecode attribute to a randomnew one on every visit. Regretfully, I am working with a javaspring backend and I am being told this is NOT easily manageable without a huge refactoroverride.p  pHow would you architect this How would you enforce that the field always starts empty There is no consistent way for browsers to event notify you of prepopulation by a password manager  some may fire an onChange, others may not.p  pI guess I can move fields around with javascript and build the real form on the fly and submit it but once again, this will have implications with spring security and validations etc. Any other ideasp
Negative 11373 pI have seen a lot of references to how Jimmy Bogard and his team do web sites.  One of the things in a hrefhttplostechies.comjimmybogard20090630howwedomvcviewmodels relnofollowhis articlea about how they do view models, is that they use Ajax very, very sparingly.  But I dont really see him go into details as to why  or what they do instead.p  pTo me, Ajax  when done well  is what makes the user experience on a web site super fluid and seamless.

Negative 11373 pRecently, I used MPI to parallelize my simulation program to speed up. The way I adopted was to rewrite one function that is very timeconsuming but easy to be parallelized. p  pThe simplified model of nonMPI program is as follows,p  precodeint main int argc, char argv[]       some declaration here     SomeOBJ.SerialFunction1     SomeOBJ.SerialFunction2     SomeOBJ.SerialFunction3      return 0  codepre  pWhile my MPI version is,p  precodeinclude mpi.h int main int argc, char argv[]       some declaration here     MPIInit NULL, NULL      SomeOBJ.SerialFunction1     SomeOBJ.ParallelFunction2  I rewrite this function to replace SomeOBJ.SerialFunction2     SomeOBJ.SerialFunction3      MPIFinalize     return 0  codepre  pI copied my non MPI code to a new folder, something like mpisimulation, and add a mpi function, revised the main file to . It works, but very inconveniently. If I update some functions, say OBJ.SerialFunction1, I need to copy the code with caution even if I just change a constant. There are still some slight differences between these versions of programs. I felt exhausted to keep them in accordance. p  pSo I wander if there is any way to let MPI program dependent on non MPI version, so that my revisions can be easily applied to both of them safely and conveniently.p  pThanks.p  pUpdate I finally adopt haraldkls suggestion. The method is to define a macro to enclose all functions that use MPI interfaces, like thisp  precodeifdef USEMPI void SomeOBJParallelFunction2    ...  endif codepre  pTo initialize MPI automatically, I define a singleton called MPIpluginp  precodeifdef USEMPI class MPIplugin private     static MPIplugin autoMPI     MPIplugin       MPIInit NULL, NULL       public     MPIplugin       MPIFinalize       MPIpluginMPIplugin autoMPI endif codepre  pIncluding MPIplugin.h in main.cpp can survive me from adding MPIInit and MPIFinalize in main.cpp when compiling MPI version. The last step is to add a PHONY target mpi in makefilep  precodeCPP  mpic OTHERFLAGS  DUSEMPI .PHONY mpi mpi MPITARGET ... codepre  pI hope it helpful to anyone who meets the same problem.p

Negative 11373 pI plan to use Saxon for an XSLT problem. I need to run my program on a schedule. When it runs it needs to select all CSV files from a directory. The number of files can be random but once processed they are cleared from the folder by another process. Originally there was only one CSV file with a fixed name so referencing it in the XSLT wasnt a problem. I could also programmatically set the filename at runtime so all was working well. My XSLT now needs to know about all the files so I can output a single XML. Im not sure if I can pass in a file path and let the XSLT read in all the files at that location Is there a command to do this or is there a better way to do this Remember I dont know how many CSV files will be in the folder when the XSLT is run. p

Negative 11373 pWe noticed that the Jelly Bean OS has a Show notifications setting under the App Info section.p  pWe have been implementing push notifications for our app, where we ask the user if they allow push notifications when they first launch the app.br Since there was no global notification setting available in pre Jelly Bean JB versions, we had the notifications ONOFF toggle inside our app in the settings menu. However, since JB devices have a notification setting outside of the app that the user could toggle, now we would need to keep track of 2 toggles one outside the app and one inside the app.p  pWhat is the recommended best practice for notifications on JB devices  Is there an API that we can use such that we know whether the user has Notifications enabled or not outside of our appp  pThank you.p

Negative 11373 pBACKGROUNDp  pI am using JRuby in an eclipse plugin for my product. I have a bunch of scripts that define a DSL and perform operations for me. I want to be able to dynamically reload these scripts whenever required. The scripts could change themselves on file system and moreover the location of the scripts could also change. I could even have multiple copies on file system of slightly modifiedchanged scripts. Each time I want scripts from a specific location to be utilized.p  pAs I have understood so far, using load instead of require should do the job. So now if before calling any Ruby methodsfunctions I use load XXX.rb, it will reload the XXX.rb utilizing the new changes.p  pPROBLEMp  pIn my code I am using ScriptingContainer to run scriplets to access ruby functions. I set load paths on this scripting container to indicate from which locations the scripts should be loaded. However, the problem is that on subsequent calls and even with different instances of ScriptingContainer, I have noticed that the scripts that were loaded the first time are utilized every time. load reloads them, but after loading those scripts once, the next time I might need to load similar scripts from a different location but its not happening.p  pMy assumption was that utilizing a different scripting container instance should have done the job but it seems that the load paths are globally set somewhere and calling setLoadPath on new ScriptingContainer instances either does not modify existing paths or only appends. If the latter case is true then probably when searching for scripts they are always found on oldest paths set and newer load paths get ignored. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 11373 pI came across a different behaviour in Silverlight and WPF when an animated property values is held filled after the animation has ended. The Remarks section in the documentation of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.media.animation.timeline.fillbehavior28vvs.9529.aspx relnofollowFillBehaviora property saysp  blockquote   pThe filling behavior can create the illusion that a property is   unsettable at runtime if you are not careful about stopping unintended   animations. Attempting to change the animated value coming from a   filling animation in code will appear to have no effect until the   filling animation is stopped.p blockquote  pHowever, in Silverlight this seems not to be true. In the small example below I animate the codeOpacitycode of a filled codeRectanglecode to zero when the Fade Out button is clicked. Although the animations codeFillBehaviorcode is set to codeHoldEndcode, resetting the Opacity to 1 in the Reset button click handler works and the Button reappears. If I do the same in a WPF application it behaves as expected, namely clicking the Reset button has no visual effect.p  pMy question is, has anybody else observed this behavior Is it perhaps a bug in Silverlight, or am I missing somethingp  pIm using Silverlight 5 and WPF 4.5 here.p  precodeltStackPanel HorizontalAlignmentCentergt     ltRectangle Namerect Width200 Height100 FillDarkGreengt     ltButton ContentFade Out ClickFadeOutButtonClickgt     ltButton ContentReset ClickResetButtonClickgt ltStackPanelgt codepre  pp  precodeprivate void FadeOutButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      var animation  new DoubleAnimation              To  0d,         Duration  TimeSpan.FromSeconds1,         FillBehavior  FillBehavior.HoldEnd           Storyboard.SetTargetPropertyanimation, new PropertyPathUIElement.OpacityProperty     Storyboard.SetTargetanimation, rect      var storyboard  new Storyboard     storyboard.Children.Addanimation     storyboard.Begin   private void ResetButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      rect.Opacity  1d  codepre

Negative 11373 pHeres my problem. I want the pop up dialog to be triggered when a use clicks on the icon and icon only of a jtree tree node. I did some research and did not find any existing way to add mouse listeners on the icon if there is please let me know. Therefore, I decided to hack my way into it and use the Point object which I can get form mouseevent.getPoint to figure out whether the mouse is on the icon. However, when I call Jtree.getCellRenctrow, col, includespacing the location I get seem to be relative to the indentation of children node.  For example, p  pParentp  pChild1p  pChild2p  pI get the same x coordinate by calling getCellRect on all three nodes although what I really want is the x plus the indentation caused by  because mouseevent.getpoint is not relative to the indentation. p  pAny idea how I can do this p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI figured out a way. I call tree.getUI to get a BasicTreeUI object and call BasicTreeUI.getLeftChildIndent and BasicTreeUI.getRightChildIndent. Summing up these two integers will be the total indentation per level of the tree or it seems to be so far. So I calculate the indentation by p  precodepath.getPathCount  1  leftindent  rightindent.  codepre  pIt works for me so far although I am not entirely sure if this is good. For example I dont really know what left and right indent mean. Also in the source of BasicTreeUI it actually has a protected method p  precodeprotected int getRowXint row, int depth       return totalChildIndent  depth  depthOffset  codepre  pThis method seems to get called by another protected method used to check if a location is within the area of tree expansion or collapse icon. I couldnt figure out much about what depthOffset is for. I guess it has something to do with whether root gets displayed or things of similar nature. p  pBut still I am not feeling very comfortable doing it this way.. could somebody either tell me Im good or that there is a better way to do this p

With C11, another way to do this is to have CustomSocket just receive  an instance of stdfunction object. It does not care where it is implemented or even if  the object is a nonnull value p  precodeclass CustomSocket  public    Socketstdfunctionltvoidconst Messageampgtampamp f  funcstdforwardf      void receivemessagefromnetworkconst Messageamp msg          unfortunately we have to do this check for every msg.         or maybe not ...        iffunc             funcmsg     private    stdfunctionltvoidconst Messageampgt func  codepre  pNow here are the questionsbr 1. What about the performance impacts Im guessing a virtual function call is faster than  calling a function object but how much faster Im implementing a fast messaging system and Id rather avoid any unnecessary performance penalty.br 2. In terms of software engineering practices, I have to say I like the second approach better. Less code, fewer files, less clutter no interface class. More flexibility you can only implement a subset of the interface by setting some of the function objects and leaving the others null. Or you can have different parts of the interface implemented in separate classes or by free functions or combination of both instead of in a single subclass. Furthermore, CustomSocket can be used by any class not just subclasses of IMsgProcessor. This is a stronggreat advantagestrong, in my opinion. br What do you say Do you see any fundamental flaw in these argument p

Negative 11373 pIm trying to create a button that brings out a hidden message form amp also hide the form after clicking the submit button  using jquery. This button works with the results of a php for loop embeded in a while loop that selects amp arrange  information from my database, so every result of the while  loop has the messagebutton below it. Now, my problem is, after setting up all the loops and jquery codes, everything works except that the message button works for all the  results at thesame time when clicked which is not what i want. I need the buttons to work separately in such a way that when the  button under a loop result is clicked only 1 form slides down under  the loop result and if another message button is clicked under another result, any open  form closes and the new one opens.

Negative 11373 pIs there any way to execute a block of code in C without suffering a Context Switchp  pI have modified perf stat to sample the counters periodically. While this works, it ends up giving me some bad data points such as 0 cycles x instructions.p  pI believe that the reason for this happening is because of context switching.p  pSince my code always pulls cycle counter value before instruction counter, if a context switch were to happen after pulling the cycle counter value, and if the process I was profiling executed for some portion of the scheduling quanta, then when I finally pulled the instruction counter value, it would be one ahead of the cycle counter value that I already pulled.p  pIs there any way to execute the codeblock without allowing a context switch to take placep

Negative 11373 pIm using devise and cancan to ensure protection to some areas of my website.p  pWhat tool is best to check that a user with a role can access and another role cannot Actually Im creating several cucumber features to make sure a user with admin role can see the page and all other roles cannot receiving an error message. Is there a better way to do thatp  pIve read a lot about when to use cucumber over rspec and when user rspec over cucumber, and the general idea I got is that I should say with cucumber the user says this and with rspec make sure that under the hood all is working properly... by the way its hard to apply this general concept at work, and to be honest I find it to be a waste of time. If I can check the final page is what is expected why should I test, for example, for controllers I find it only worth it to test for model validations and model functions.p  pAny suggestion Possibly something more practical than the RSpec book since I have to apply concepts asap.p
Negative 11373 pLets begin with the question final purpose my aim is to build a wordbased neural network which should take a basic sentence and select for each individual word the meaning it is supposed to yield in the sentence itself. It is then going to learn something about the language for example the possible correlation between two given words, what is the probability to find both in a single sentence and so on and at the final stage after the learning phase try to build some very simple sentences of its own according to some input.p  pIn order to do this I need some kind of database representing a vocabulary of a given language from which I could extract some information such as word list, definitions, synonyms et cetera. The database should be structured in a way such that I can build C data structures containing the needed information such as p  precodetypedef struct dictEntry DictionaryEntry typedef struct dict Dictionary  struct dictEntry      const char word                Word string     const char definitions        Array of definition strings     DictionaryEntry synonyms      Array of pointers to synonym words     Dictionary dictionary          Pointer to parent dictionary   struct dict      const char language            Language identification string     int count                       Number of elements in the dictionary     float correlations            Correlation matrix between ith and jth entries     DictionaryEntry entries        Array of dictionary entries  codepre  por equivalent ObjC objects.p  pI know from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1696387searchingthemacosxsystemdictionariesSearching the Mac OSX system dictionariesa that apple provided dictionaries are licensed so I cannot use them to create my data structures. Basically what I want to do is the following given an arbitrary word A I want to fetch all the dictionary entries which have a definition containing A and select such definition only. I will then implement some kind of intersection procedure to select the most appropriate definition and synonyms based on the rest of the sentence and build a correlation matrix.p  pLet me give a little example let us suppose I type a sentence containing play I want to fetch all the entries such as game, instrument, actor, etc. the word play can be correlated to and for each of them select the corresponding definition I dont want for example to extract the instrument definition which corresponds to the tool meaning since you cannot play a tool. I will then select the most appropriate of these definitions looking at the rest of the sentence if it contains also the word actor then I will assign to play the meaning drama or another suitable definition. The most basic way to do this is scanning every definition in the dictionary searching for the word play so I will need to access all definitions without restrictions and as I understand this cannot be done using the dictionaries located under LibraryDictionaries. Sadly this work MUST be done offline.p  pIs there any available resource I can download which allows me to get my hands on all the definitions and fetch my info Currently Im not interested in any particular file format could be a database or an xml or anything else but it must be something I can decompose and put in a data structure. I tried to google it but, whatever the keywords I use, if I include the word vocabulary or dictionary I pretty obviously only get pages about the other words definitions on some online dictionary site I guess this is not the best thing to search for...p  pI hope the question is clear... If it is not Ill try to explain it in a different way Anyway, thanks in advance to all of you for any helpful information.p

Negative 11373 pI am rendering a video file from input pictures that come from a 3D engine at runtime I dont pass an actual picture file, just RGB memory. This works perfectly when outputting MP4 using CODECIDH264 as video codec.p  pBut when I want to create an MPG file using CODECIDMPEG2VIDEO, the resulting file is simply broken. No player can play the video correctly and when I then want to concatenate that MPG with another MPG file, and transform the result MP4 in another step, the resulting .mp4 file has both videos, but many frames from the original MPG video and only video Sound works fine are simply skipped.p  pAt first I thought the MPG  MP4 conversion was the problem, but then I noticed that the initial MPG, which comes from the video render engine, is already broken, which would speak for broken headers. Not sure if it is the system or sequence headers that are broken, though. Or if it could be something totally different.p  pIf you want to have a look, here is the file a hrefhttpwww.fileupload.netdownload7093306broken.mpg.html relnofollowhttpwww.fileupload.netdownload7093306broken.mpg.htmlap  pAgain, the exact same muxing code works perfectly fine when directly creating an MP4 from the video render engine, so Im pretty sure the input data, swscale, etc. is correct. The only difference is that CODECIDH264 is used and some additional variables like qmin, qmax, etc. are set, which are all specific to H264 so should not have an impact.p  pAlso, neither avformatwriteheader nor avwritetrailer report an error.p  pAs an additional info, when viewing the codec data of the MPG in VLC player, it is not able to show the FPS, resolution and format should show 640x360, 30 fps and 420 YUV.p  pI am using a rather new 23 months old, maybe FFmpeg version, which I compiled from sources with MinGW.p  pAny ideas on how to resolve this would be welcome. Currently, I am out of those p

Negative 11373 pI have a php based website and I am making a site to open in a pop up and I need to open another site in the same pop up after a specific period of time it is a kind of a website rotator. p  pIt is working fine for most of the websites, but when a website opens which has an exit confirmation, the rotator stops as a dialog box opens, saying something like are you sure you want to leave this pagep  pIs there any way that i can make these website to work properly and redirect without opening any confirmation dialog boxp  pNOTE  The website which is being rotated owners are intentionally doing this to get more visitors. They are exploiting my rotator The number of websites in the rotator are so high that I cant manually remove all those website as it will take ages to Check each website and removing the bad ones manually  more websites are added to the rotator by the users everyday.p  pThe second thing that we can do is probably making a confirmation page that checks each website for exit confirmation dialog box and passes it only if there is no exit confirmation dialog box. The website will be added to the rotator only after passing from the confirmation page.p  pSo can anyone share a script which checks for exit confirmation dialog boxp
Negative 11373 pI have a project in Eclipse that somehow does not group the res or bin items in the package explorer into groups but shows them as individual items with white folder icons. The image shows this. In the Countdown project you have res.layout, res.menu etc. but in the NewProject these are both in the res folder.br The CountDown project also refuses to build with the error R cannot be resolved to variable. I know this is due to the fact that the R.java file is not created by the precompiler and I assume this is also related to the fact that the folder structure looks different.br Now I have already tried many things like cleaning the project and rebuild manually but so far nothing solves this problem.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBN5ck.png altEclipse package explore with colored an white entriesp

Can someone explain what I am doing wrong It would be really appreciated.p  pInitialize Google p  precodeprotected void loadGoogle      var googleScript  function loadScript           var script  document.createElementscript          script.type  textjavascript          script.src  httpmaps.google.commapsapijssensorfalseamp callbackinitialize           document.body.appendChildscript                    window.onload  loadScript     ClientScript.RegisterStartupScripttypeofPage, CreateGoogleMapScript, googleScript, true  codepre  pCreate maps called multiple timesp  precodeprotected void createMapString mapId, String address      var script  function initialize           var geocoder  new google.maps.Geocoder          var latlng  new google.maps.LatLng34.397, 150.644          var mapOptions  mapId              zoom 16,          center latlng,          mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP                     var map  mapId    new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementById  mapId  , mapOptions  mapId             var address    address            geocoder.geocode  address address, functionresults, status           if status  google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK           map  mapId  .setCenterresults[0].geometry.location          var marker  new google.maps.Marker          map map  mapId  ,          position results[0].geometry.location                     else           alertGeocode was not successful for the following reason   status                                    ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlocktypeofPage, CreateMapScriptmapId, script, true  codepre  pCalled byp  pWhile loop, with a codeliteral.Textcode that adds a new div, followed by codecreateMapmapId, addresscodep  pUPDATEp  pMy new codep  precode var script  function initialize  var geocoder  new google.maps.Geocoder                                for int i  0 i lt maps.Count i                              String currentId  maps[i] as String                 String currentLocation  locations[i] as String                  script                          var latlng  new google.maps.LatLng  500  ,  400                        var myOptions                            zoom 16,                          center latlng,                          mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP                                                                var map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementById  currentId  , myOptions                       var address    currentLocation                            geocoder.geocode  address address, functionresults, status                             if status  google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK                               map.setCenterresults[0].geometry.location                              var marker  new google.maps.Marker                                  map map,                                  position results[0].geometry.location                                                           else                                   alertGeocode was not successful for the following reason   status                                                                                    script   codepre  pNow all maps are drawn, but only the last map has the right location.

But they all have some similar behaviors, for example coderegistercode, codelogincode, codeforgetPasswordcode, etc. So, can I package out a common codeUserControllercode with all the basic database setup into one file or script to reduce the development work load Thanks.  p

I connect to the db fine in a file called codeconfig.phpcode, and include this file in codeindex.phpcode with coderequireoncecode.p  pI can successfully query the db from another file called codeprocess.phpcode, but the problem is within a function within that file it seems my DBO object is out of scope within that function.p  pHere are the relevant code snippetsp  pstrongindex.phpstrongp  precoderequireonce.libconfig.php codepre  pstrongconfig.phpstrongp  precode tested and connects fine     pdo  new PDOmysqlhost . hostname . dbname . dbname, username, password, array     PDOATTRPERSISTENT gt true  codepre  pstrongprocess.phpstrongp  precodeltphp ...  can call pdo fine in this file outside of functions ...  function authenticateu, p       cant call pdo in here, error says pdo is nonobject     que  pdogtqueryselect userid, userpass from users where username   . u .  limit 1     ...   gt codepre  pBy the way, Im using PDO because I was having similar trouble with codemysqlicode, and am trying to get away from codemysqlcode, which is apparently depreciated and discouraged.p  pEDIT I should have clarified first based on the number of responses I got on this matter I did try to strongpass pdo in as a param to the functionstrong, with no luck or change in the error message.p  pSOLUTION OK, apparently the problem was that I needed to add coderequireonceconfig.phpcode in my strongprocess.phpstrong file as well.

Negative 11373 pI have been tasked to write an application that gives the users these capabilitesp  ol liOpen a map centered on the USA [this I know how to do]li liUser can either doubleclick  multiple times or use the zoom control or pan the map  any number of times, to their hearts content li liUser ultimately chooses a region e.g. Finger Lakes District of NY or a town or metropolitan area e.g. Walla Walla, Washington or Detroit. li liI have to get the latitude and longitude of the users chosen location. li ol  pIve found in the API docs how to open a map centered on a latlon and how to include the zoom controls. But what UI action could the user take to signal this is the place I choose The user has already been clicking to zoom the map, so a simple click wont suffice to signal the user has made her choice. Should the user drop the little orange man onto the map Does that raise an event I can listen for, which will give me the orange mans position  Are there other UI metaphors available that could be used for this purposep  pP.S. The user may or may not be clicking. The zoom control and panning could be used instead. So I cannot rely upon the click event.  What is needed is a UI gesture or metaphor that means emexplicitlyem  this is the area I choose.p

Negative 11373 pI have two ellipsoids in R3 described in terms of their centre points P, their axes lengths a,b,c, and their rotation vector R. I wish to interpolate a tubular structure between these two ellipsoids along a given centre line. This is done by creating an ellipsoid centred at each point along the centre line. Its axes lengths are interpolated linearly between those at the two endpoints, and the rotation is obtained as a quaternion using spherical linear interpolation, or a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSlerp relnofollowSLERPa.p  pI previously asked a similar question on this problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16803721interpolatingbetweentwoarbitrarilyorientedellipsoidsherea. I have since isolated the issue a little further, and thought it warranted a new post. The difference here is that before doing SLERP, I first rotate the two reference ellipsoids by the inverse of the rotation matrix that describes one of them, such that one of them is now axisaligned i.e. has no rotation. Previously this appeared to solve the problem, but I have encountered an example where this fix does not work.p  pThe source code to reproduce this issue is available a hrefhttppastebin.comAt9GAsqg relnofollowherea.

Negative 11373 pThere are similar questions to this here already, but the answers and suggestions relate to older versions of Android. I understand that the bluetooth stack has been completely revised from 4.2 onwards and older solutions do not work anymore.p  pI have tried all the older solutions to no avail. the use of the private APIs no longer works because they have changed. I dont mind using private APIs but it must work on the newest versions and later ie API 17p  pI am trying to do the followingp  pset up a bluetooth pairing between an Android device and an embedded device using legacy PIN pairing without the embedded device being discoverable nor the user having to manually enter the PIN. In fact I want no PIN entry dialog box at all.p  pThe plan is that the two devices have a predefined shared secret PIN, so that I can perform the pairing programmatically and then open an RFCOMM connection between them. All of this without UI. The hardware address of the embedded device is known to the Android program.p  pThere is no security issue here. the project involves just talking to a nearyby, small embedded device through BT as simple as possible.p  pIdeas that might work on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean most welcome, thanks.p

Negative 11373 pI have a form submission generated from COM in an asp page.  The end of the form submission looks like the followingp  precodeIFrame1.contentWindow.SaveChanges IFrame2.contentWindow.SaveChanges return true codepre  pThe SaveChanges function issues an AJAX call to a .net AjaxPro method.  In IE and Chrome this works fine, but in FF and Safari, they both result in communications errors, presumably because the HTTP connection they were operating on has been dropped.  I tried to change them from AjaxPro to jQuery in order to get more info, but the error just reports communication failure.p  pThe idea I had to solve the problem was to chain them together as such with SaveChanges accepting and calling a callback functionp  precodeIFrame1.contentWindow.SaveChangesIFrame2.contentWindow.SaveChangesreturn true codepre  pBut not only will no browser accept this javascript, even if it did work, it wouldnt accomplish my goal as the return true would be run in the context of IFrame2.contentWindow.SaveChanges, not in the context of the ASP page.p  pI dont need to wait for the AJAX call to finish running, but I do need to wait to return true until SaveChanges has made the AJAX call to actually issue the return truep

Negative 11373 pIm currently making a Computer Science thesis on a multithreaded software implementation of a turbo decoder. The basic problem is as followsp  ul lilet y1, ..., yn be the sequence of noisy bit received through a channel. Two SISO decoders work in parallel each one receiving the first bit of the sequence and the parity bit y1j, j in 1,2  the objective is to compute the LLR loglikelyhood ratio, which gives info on the probability that the current bit is either 0 or 1, which is then fed to the other SISO decoder for the next iteration. Suppose the received bits are split into shorter frames of data. SISO means soft input, soft output, because each decoder gets an estimation of the bit probabilities in input and outputs its own estimationli ul  pEach computation of the LLR requires lots of serialized ACS operations, depending on the amount of the bits in each frames and on the amount of bits used by the encoder to make the parity bits for the initial sequence. Such computation can be summed with these nested for cycles for each one of the two SISO decoders working in parallelp  blockquote   pcodefor i1 to NFRAMEScodep      blockquote     pcodefor j1 to NELSFRAMEScodep          blockquote       pcodefor k1 to 4codep              blockquote         pcodefor l1 to NSTATEScodep                  blockquote           pcodedoopscodep         blockquote       blockquote     blockquote   blockquote blockquote  pNote that the above loop doesnt actually appear in the algorithm, but it does match quite closely the operations made for each iteration. Generally, NSTATES is around 8 or 16 it depends on the amount of bits each encoder uses to compute the parity bits on the input sequence and doops requires a sum, a max and a vector normalization.p  pAt first I tried to make an implementation using Jython, but the result was pretty disheartening the operations in the nested loops above took  with the multithreaded version  around 20 minutes  with a moderate 2 mil amount of bits.p  pOn the other hand, a Java implementation requires 1 sec with 4 mil bits using the singlethreaded version of the algorithm.p  pWhy is there such a huge differencep

Negative 11373 pIm writing an app that detects when you enter a specific location. When you reach a location, it detects the change and sends a local notification. When the notification is received and opened, it is supposed to switch screens. The app seemed to be working flawlessly for me, but my tester told me that the screen NEVER switches for him. To recreate the problem, we went to his house and he demonstrated. Something i noticed is that before entering the hotspot, he first hits the home button and then puts the phone to sleep. After performing multiple tests, we determined that the screens will switch if the phone was simply put to sleep with the app still open. If we minimize the app first AND THEN put the phone to sleep, the screens never switch. p  pThe screen isnt supposed to switch until the app is opened with the notification. Im curious as to what the difference is, if theres a delegate method to handle events like this, or why this could possibly be happening any ideasp  pstrongEDITstrongp  p Code related to location services p  pThis is the singleton class i use for the location servicesp  precodeimplementation LocationManager  static LocationManager locationManager   LocationManager locationManager      if locationManager  NULL          locationManager  [[LocationManager alloc] init]           return locationManager   end codepre  pThis is the code in the welcomeviewcontroller that actually implements the delegate method its long so im only posting the important partsp  precode voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didUpdateLocationsNSArray locations      if [self getAppState]  TRACKINGHOTSPOT          NSLognLAT fnLNG f, [self deviceLatitude], [self deviceLongitude]         for int j  0 j lt [MinX count] j              if [self deviceLatitude] gt [MinX[j] floatValue] ampamp [self deviceLatitude] lt [MaxX[j] floatValue] ampamp [self  deviceLongitude] gt [MinY[j] floatValue] ampamp [self deviceLongitude] lt [MaxY[j] floatValue]                  if [self testCells [CellId[j] intValue]]                      [self.delegate setNum [CellId[j] intValue]] ...  codepre  pI also set the appropriate flags in the info.plist file. It was working on my last build, but i really havent changed much since then. I dont know why its not working. And, its only working in certain areas. It detects that its in the hotspot, sends the notification to alert me that it went there, but when it switches view controllers it doesnt work ONLY if you hit the home button and then put the phone to sleep before receiving the notification. it switches correctly if the app is left open OR if you simply hit the home button. I watched memory and CPU management in Xcode through the process and memory drops through the floor when i minimize and put to sleep, but not when i simply put to sleep. I believe its possible the phone isnt considering it in the background until its minimized, even if the phone is asleep. Maybe im wrong.p  pIn appdelegate, i set it up to detect whether it entered the foreground or not with flags. But no matter what, if the app is opened from a notification, it should send control to the didreceivelocalnotification method rightp

Negative 11373 pIm attempting to send the currentTime, duration, and currentPrecentAbsolute values out to a php page that grabs those variables and stores them into a database using ajax. I have it working fine on the pause event, however when I try using timeupdate I get multiple calls.p  pI want to be able to auto send the data when the currentPercentAbsolute reaches 25, 50 and 75. I know what the problem is, Im just unsure how to solve it. Timeupdate speed is variable across browsers, I believe with a default of around 250ms. So while my percent is 25, 50 and or 75, the ajax will continue to run. Roughly 4 times 4250ms in a second. And of course thats only if the video is roughly 100 seconds long. If its 200 seconds long, currentPercentAbsolute would stay at those percentages a whole second longer, running my ajax 8 times. p  pSo ultimately my question is, whats a better way to do what Im attempting.

Negative 11373 pA Spock specification looks likep  precodedef mySpecsomeData      testStuff     where someData ltlt someDataList  codepre  pcodesomeDataListcode is a list of records that is tested and for each member of this list, the codemySpeccode method is run, sequentially. What I want is that the first k members of the list to run a thread, the following k members to run in a second thread and so on... In theory this can be done relatively easy with Executors Framework and codeJUnitCorecode class since Spock relies on JUnit. p  pThe problem however is how to inject smaller codesomeDataListcode into the class that has codemySpeccode method, because Spock doesnt allow a constructor and JUnitCore wants class name the class that has the testspecification and not an instance. An ugly solution would be to make n copies of codemySpeccode, each having a distinct smaller codesomeDataListcode, and each to be run by a distinct thread but this is a very ugly solution.p  pIs there a workaround for this Or is there another way of running Spock specificationstests in parallelp

Negative 11373 pIm baffled.  Each of our employees must sign in to our server which begins their ASP session.  All the research Ive done shows that we should be able to change how long this session lasts using codesession.timeout xcode where x is the number of minutes we want the session to last, default being 20 minutes.  Ive changed this timeout without any consistent results.p  pI finally set up a function that checks to see if I am logged in every 10 seconds to see if I could nail down a consistent session length.  So far the times have varied from 7 hours to 40 hours over 8 trials.  I have done this both in a chrome and firefox browser to see about different session times and they have emalwaysem been timed out at the exact same time.  Coworkers are not getting timed out at these exact times, however.p  pI read something about global.asa.  We either are not using this or none of us understand it well enough to know where it is.p  pIve also read about and tried to change the timeout sessions for the application pools in IIS.  Im doing from Windows 7 and most of the tutorials were for older versions of windows but I believe I found the correct place but I still couldnt find that the changes I was making made any difference.p  ptldr  Is there a way to find how much time is left in a classic ASP sessionp

Negative 11373 pI am using MvvmCross with Xamarin.Android.  I have the Visibility plugin installed.  In my Android application project, I have created an Androidspecific visibility converter that supports the Invisible state view not shown, but still taking up layout spacep  precodepublic class VisibleOrInvisibleValueConverter    MvxValueConverterltbool, ViewStatesgt    public ViewStates Convertbool value, Type targetType, CultureInfo cultureInfo, object parameter        MvxTrace.ErrorVisibleOrInvisibleValueConverter.Convert     return value  ViewStates.Visible  ViewStates.Invisible     codepre  pIn my .axml markup, I use this converter like thisp  precode    ltFrameLayout         androidlayoutwidth0dip         androidlayoutheight5dip         androidlayoutweight1         androidbackgroundff0000         localMvxBindVisibility Selected, ConverterVisibleOrInvisible, FallbackValue0 gt codepre  pBased on the documentation at a hrefhttpsgithub.comMvvmCrossMvvmCrosswikiValueConvertersreferencingvalueconvertersintouchanddroid relnofollowhttpsgithub.comMvvmCrossMvvmCrosswikiValueConvertersreferencingvalueconvertersintouchanddroida, I believe that MvvmCross will automatically discover the existence of this value converter, since it is in my UI project.p  pAt runtime, the bound value always takes on the fallback value, no matter what the value of Selected is.  Based on the documentation at a hrefhttpsgithub.comMvvmCrossMvvmCrosswikiValueConvertersreferencingvalueconvertersintouchanddroid relnofollowhttpsgithub.comMvvmCrossMvvmCrosswikiValueConvertersreferencingvalueconvertersintouchanddroida, this means that either my binding source path is missing, or the value converter threw an exception.p  pUnfortunately, I think I can rule both of those out.  For the first possibility, I tried replacing my custom VisibleOrInvisible converter with the stock MvvmCross Visibility converter, and it worked fine.  That is, the binding worked fine.  The stock Visibility converter doesnt support my desired behavior, though.  Anyway, I think this shows that the source path Selected does exist.p  pFor the second possibility, Ive set a breakpoint in the Convert function of the VisibleOrInvisible converter, and it is never executed.  I also added an MvxTrace call in there, and I never see the trace message.p  pAlthough my converter is supposed to be automatically discovered, I have also tried explicitly adding my platformspecific assembly to the list of assemblies that implement value converters by overriding the ValueConverterAssemblies property getter in Setup.csp  precodeprotected override ListltAssemblygt ValueConverterAssemblies    get        var toReturn  base.ValueConverterAssemblies     toReturn.Addtypeof VisibleOrInvisibleValueConverter.Assembly     return toReturn     codepre  pBut this did not help.p  pI think that MvvmCross is discovering my converter OK.  If I intentionally refer to a nonexistent converter in my .axml file, I see exception messages in the debug trace at runtime.  But when I specify my VisibleOrInvisible converter, these messages do not appear.p  pMy working theory is that an exception is occurring in the process of invoking my converter, before the only line of code eminem the converter is executed.  But I dont know how to get to the bottom of that.  No exception messages appear in the debug trace.p  pIs there a simple step that Im getting wrong  Ive studied the MvvmCross ValueConversion example pretty carefully, and I think Im doing everything that example does.p
Negative 11373 pIm building an application for multiple desktop platforms Windows, Mac, and maybe later for Linux.p  pI was wondering which programming language and IDE combination would be the best for mep  ol liProgramming language need to be whether C preferred or Java.li liCore libraries must be shared between all platforms, means all platforms must link to a single core library by library I mean a list of classes and functions.li liWindows and Mac are in priority, Linux app is for future plannings.li liDesign of the app is completely custom, it doesnt follow any guidelines of each platforms.li ol  pIm stuck between these three solutionsp  ol liUse Xamarin.Mac  Visual Studio for Windows and link the core classes between them.li liUse GTK for the whole project and compile multiple builds for each platforms.li liUse Java for the whole project and compile multiple builds for each platforms.li ol  pFor 2 and 3, I need an advice that which language is more suitable for me, considering the design of my application.

Negative 11373 pOkay, the goal is to attempt to detect when a web page has been updated, and display the updated page in a WebBrowser control. For instance, say that I know Amazon will make the Playstation 4 available today, but I dont know when. I put the address of the Amazon PS4 page in my form, and the program periodically launches a WebBrowser to that page and saves the HTML to a list of string. Next time around when it launches the browser, it will check the results against my list. If the list already contains this particular string, the WebBrowser is closed and we wait again using Thread.Sleep.p  precodeprivate void Launch    while blnWorking        if intWindowCount lt intMaxCount            ShowBrowserUriGetBrowserUri           if intWait gt 0       Thread.SleepintWait      delegate void ShowBrowserUriDelegateUri uri  private void ShowBrowserUriUri uri    if InvokeRequired        ShowBrowserUriDelegate del  new ShowBrowserUriDelegateShowBrowserUri     Invokedel, uri      else        CookieContainer cc  GetUriCookieContaineruri     CookieCollection cc1  new CookieCollection      if cc  null            cc1  cc.GetCookiesuri           THBrowser thb  new THBrowseruri, cc1, this THBrowser is a form with a WebBrowser control     THBrowser calls the Navigate method of its WebBrowser control      intWindowCount     thb.Show     thb.SendToBack     codepre  pThe problem is, my program seems to be randomly opening the website in Firefox my default browser instead of using the THBrowserWebBrowser. Ive stepped through, and it seems to occur every time I step out of the Thread.Sleep.p  pIt also may be relevant that OnDocumentComplete for my WebBrowser compares the current HTML to my List of HTML strings and closes the control if the page contents are already contained in my list.p  pI dont have the most recent version in front of me, but that part goes something like...p  precodevoid webBrowser1DocumentCompletedobject sender, WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventArgs e    if e.Url.AbsolutePath  sender as WebBrowser.Url.AbsolutePath     return    if ResultsList.Containsthis.webBrowser1.Document.Body.InnerHtml     this.Close   else     ResultsList.Addthis.webBrowser1.Document.Body.InnerHtml  codepre  pI think this may be relevant because the THBrowser opens briefly, disappears, then a new tab is immediately opened in Firefox.p  pIm pretty sure the Thread.Sleep has something to do with it. Although, I had seen this problem occasionally before introducing the Thread.Sleep, it has multiplied 100 fold since.p  pMaybe Thread.Sleep isnt the best way to space out my intervals. Maybe Im just going about this completely wrong. Any suggestions are appreciated.p

Negative 11373 pIm fairly new to SQL and MySQL. I am designing a relational database within MySQL to store the contact information for various people that I meet at networking events. I would like to make the database as normalized as possible but I am running into difficulty when designing the hierarchical relationship between Company, Division and Job Titles. I am still only designing this database on paper. p  pFor example in Finance, you could work for J.P. Morgan within their Investment Banking division. This division has several subdivisions such as ECM. And within ECM there are other subdivisions. Thus, one person may be J.P. Morgan  Investment Banking  ECM  Sales  Analyst with Investment Banking, ECM, and Sales all being subdivisions of one another, J.P. Morgan being the company and Analyst being the Job.  p  pHowever, for other professions, such as being selfemployed, a job may not be a part of any division. Thus, SelfEmployedBiz  SelfEmployed. p  pClearly, my problem is that some Jobs belong to several subdivisions while other jobs belong to zero subdivisions. p  pMy question How do I go about designing this part of the database The only thing that I can think of is to add several Division tables TopDivision, SecondDivision, ThirdDivision, etc but that seems both messy and awkward.

Negative 11373 pam making a website, and have a wrapper on the footer, i want the footer as sticky footer, but when i minimise the screen and make it smaller the footer overtakes the content and header. p  precode    footerWrapper   height 177px  bottom 0  position absolute  width 100   codepre  pThis does what i want as it makes the footer go to the bottom of the page regardless of what size the screen is. however when i minimise the screen and move it up it stays absolute hence staying in that 1 page.p  pas i would want it to stay on the page rather than the footer being absolute.p  pany ideas.p

Negative 11373 pSo I am creating a website for which I want to create an interval timer.  Basically, the user will enter the number of rounds, length of working interval, and length of resting interval.  When they press start, the timer will start and go for the length of the working interval say 30sec.  When the timer gets to 30 seconds, it will drop back to 0 and go for the length of the resting interval.  It will continue to do this for the amount of rounds indicated 1 working interval  1 resting interval  1 round.  I have the timer created, however I am unsure of how to switch the timer at each interval.

Negative 11373 pIm attempting to transition a program from tkinter to Kivy. When I got to a section where I used codemessagebox.askyesnocode, I figured that I could just create a popup with a couple of buttons, and Id be done. The issue Ive encountered is that, while Kivys popup and tkinters messagebox are both modal, when I call codemessagebox.askyesnocode in a function, messagebox will halt all execution of the current function until the messagebox is destroyed, while the popup will allow the function to finish. My original program hadp  precodeflag  messagebox.askyesnomessage...,parentself if flag     Stuff if flag is true else     Stuff if flag is false codepre  pHowever, this will not work with a Kivy popup since the popup will open, and the program will continue to execute. Is there a way to halt execution until the popup has been destroyed, or another way to solve the problemp  pThe basic idea is a quasidialog for a two player game. Here, the program asks one player if he wants to perform an action, such as move a piece. If the player says yes, then the second player is given a codemessagebox.askyesnocode for a countermove. A simple analogy is advancing a runner from first base to third base on a single in baseball. You would have to ask the offensive team if he wants to advance the runner, or have the runner remain at second. If the answer is yes, then the program would have to ask the defensive team if he wants to throw to third. It would definitely be possible to create a function to handle each instance of askyesno, with appropriate bindings, but it seems excessive.p

Negative 11373 pFor a Django project I am working on, beside the social authentication methods provided by python social auth, I am trying to implement and integrate also a a hrefhttppasswordless.org relnofollowpasswordless authenticationa flow. Beside other advantages, the most appealing part of this approach to me is that, it unifies signup and signin, just like in other social authentication backends. This provides unification of email authentication p  pEach time a user wants to login or signup they only submit their email, receive the temporary login token via email, click on it, and they are in.

Negative 11373 pIm trying to create a tunnel using Node.js that will allow me to access Server X from Server Y. Server X is connected to a router that isnt port forwarded and I wont know the IP of Server X until it connects, which means that Server X has to open a socket to Server Y and not the other way round.p  pIve successfully created a version of this using codesocket.iocode. Server X opens a socket to server Y, the user can then access Server Y in a web browser and Server Y proxies the requests down the socket to Server X.p  pWhat I would like to do is allow access to any kind of port on Server X, and forward not just web requests but requests of any kind. For example, Id like to allow forwarding of SSH so I can access SSH on Server X through Server Y doesnt have to be port 22. codelocaltunnel.mecode is an existing service which is an exact example of what I want to achieve.p  pAre there any libraries that could help me achieve this, or can I build it from the ground up quite easily I built the web request tunnel easily, perhaps it can be adapted to support not just web traffic Ive attached the code to my existing web tunnel below.p  pstrongServer X connects to Server Y on port 3001, receives requests for data and sends it backstrongp  precodevar socket  requiresocket.ioclienthttplocalhost3001         socket.onconnect, function             console.logConnected               Register the event for request of data             socket.onrequest, functiondata                  Get the path                 var options                     host localhost,                   port 3000,                   path data.path,                   method data.method                                   var request  http.getoptions, functionresp                   resp.ondata, functionchunk                     socket.emitresponse,  html chunk                       Probably need to fix this for file transfers.

Negative 11373 pSo, Im really new to MatLab, and I was trying to make a cylinder using code[X Y Z]  cylindercode.Then I got these 3 matrices codeXcode codeYcode and codeZcode that generate an actual cylinder if I codemeshcode them. Now, what I need help to do is rotate this code[X Y Z]code cylinder 90 degrees clockwise in the codeycode axis. I know there is this command called coderotatecode but my teacher wants me to use rotation and translation matrices explicitly. How could I create these matrices and multiply them to the cylinderIs there a better way to make the cylinder Im really not used to matlab, if you could explain in a detailed form, I would be very thankful.p

Negative 11373 pIm a relatively new developer, and venturing into Arduino and GAE is my very first attempt at building something useful. I really hope to learn something useful from this project. p  pI am currently involved in an Arduino and Google App Engine GAE project. Im designing an ambient sensor system, consisting of a temperature sensor, light sensor and motion sensor. I am also developing a webapp using Google App Engine. Users can use this webapp to view their ambient status through the cloud, in an IoT fashion. p  pI have an Arduino Uno and an Arduino Ethernet Shield. I have been successfully able to send sensor data to GAE datastore, but only when login is DISABLED in the webapp. p  pWhen I enable user login for the webapp, the Arduino data DOES NOT get sent to the google datastore. p  pMy question How do I get the Arduino to send data to the Google Datastore, with a username identity appended to it p  pIdeal scenerio Users can append their google account email address to the arduino code, and data that is sent from the arduino to the datastore is visible by this Google account only, when the user logs into the app with their Google account. p  pRight now, only the URL of my webapp is provided in the arduino code. How and where do I indicate a particular Google account identity In my arduino code, this is the only line which informs the arduino of my webapp. What other lines of code should I include to achieve my desired resultsp  precodeServer to connect to char serverName[]  httpambienatorsnus.appspot.com codepre  pHere is the partial arduino code. p  precodeinclude ltSPI.hgt include ltEthernet.hgt      Enter a MAC address for your controller below byte mac[]    0x00, 0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC, 0xDE, 0x02   Server to connect to char serverName[]  httpambienatorsnus.appspot.com   Initialize the Ethernet client library EthernetClient client  void setup    analogReferenceINTERNAL    Serial.begin9600    start the Ethernet connection   if Ethernet.beginmac  0        whiletrue       give the Ethernet shield a second to initialize   delay1000      void postData    String temperature  Stringinttemp0.5   String lightStr  Stringintlight   String move  Stringmovement   String moves1  Stringmoves   String data  Stringtemp temperatureampmovementmoveampmovesmoves1amplightlightStr   whileclient.connected        Serial.printlnConnecting to client      client.connectserverName, 80      client.printlnPOST arduinopost HTTP1.1   client.printlnHost ambienatorsnus.appspot.com   client.printlnConnection keepalive   client.printContentLength    client.printlndata.length   client.printlnCacheControl maxage0   client.printlnContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded   client.printlnAcceptLanguage enUS,enq0.8   client.println   client.printdata   Serial.printdata   client.println   Serial.println   char c   whileclient.available        c  client.read      client.stop  codepre  pYou may view the webapp here a hrefhttpambienatorsnus.appspot.com relnofollowhttpambienatorsnus.appspot.comap  pYou can find the rest of the webapp code in this github repo a hrefhttpsgithub.comtaniachambienatorsnus relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtaniachambienatorsnusap  pThank you very much for taking your time in reading this, and thanks in advanced for your help and assistance p

Negative 11373 pI am very confused as to how to write the code in javascriptjquery to allow for the proper submission of my form. I currently have a function to handle an onclick event, which loads the proper form. However, the form fails to submit successfully.

If I try to import with both, like shown above, it gives a xml validation error indicating the second tag is not an acceptable child element of GlobalWorkflow tag.p  pIf I put GlobalLists second, GlobalLists is the invalid child element, Fields tag is invalid if its written as second element.pli lipIf it is imported including Fields tag, after import of global workflow I can see the defined field in the WI Field Explorer of Power Tools but not in the definitions of the work items or in any combo for Field Selection, only in Work Item Field Explorernot in Layout Tab, Workflow Tab or Fields Tab of work item.pli ol  pstrongemMSDN vaguely explained the process likeemstrongp  blockquote   pIf you specify a field that is not currently defined for the team   project or the collection, the field is created when the global   workflow is imported.p blockquote  pI can assume, global workflow xml only saves the field and then you still have to define the same field in the fields tab of the work item to use it in Layout tab and Workflow tab. TFS only prevents another field creation in the same name and also implements the defined field rules. This logic, is not nice imho but still can be acceptable.p  pBut there is still a problem with that logic to be true, because if I import global workflow with only globallist definitions, defined globallists are not seen in the global list designer screen or not in combo fields like allowedvalues rule options.p  pIm using codewitadmin importglobalworkflow collectionurl ffilepathcode command and though I want my global workflow definition can be used from all my Team Project Collectionp  pstrongExpected Resultstrong I want to be able to import a global workflow with both Fields and GlobalLists elements and after import operation, in a work item I should be able to see these definitions like the way Ive created using Power tools.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong 1 is solved one global workflow can not include both fields and globallists elements.

Negative 11373 pSo I have been working with the Live SDK for a few weeks. Ive gotten an Android version of what I want done and Im working on a Windows Phone 8 version. Basically, the goal is to create an app that can record a video and then upload that video to OneDrive. I am able to upload pictures to OneDrive currently on the app. However I have hit many walls when it comes to video. Firstly, apparently WP8 doesnt allow access to video files recorded. Secondly, I cannot find how to use the native camera for video recording and storing it where I can access it.p  pSo really my question is how can I accomplish this on WP8 or is it even possible Ideally Id like to use the native camera and not write my own but if I have to I will.p

Negative 11373 pIm working on a fairly large project that involves 3D drawing, and I want to add some visualizers for example, to see the bounding boxes of the objects to make debugging easier. However, Im having a problem in deciding how to go about this. p  pOne option would be to create a public function to draw the visualizers, and call this function when I enable debugging from the UI. This would have the advantage of not modifying the existing functions, but extending the class with a new function. The disadvantage would be creating dependencies, as one of my colleagues said, we would need to modify the base class, and all the deriving classes to add this function. p  pAnother option would be to modify the existing drawing function so that strongitstrong handles the drawing of the visualizers. This hides the implementation details, but also it seems to me it makes the code less modular.p  pYet another option is extending the class, adding the visualizer in the drawing function, and swapping classes when debugging is enabled. Mixins would be of help, but C doesnt support that.p  pWhat would be the best approach to do this Im looking for a solution that is modular and respects the SOLID principles.p

Negative 11373 pThis question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24129160railsresquejobscannotaccessdatabaseioerrorthis unanswered questiona from a few months ago.p  pI am following the a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes271resque relnofollowRailscast for Resquea to get it setup in my app for background job handling. I started by running codebrew install rediscode, then bundled the gem, then created coderesque.rakecode in codelibtaskscode with the following contentp  precoderequire resquetasks task resquesetup gt environment codepre  pThen I created a directory called coderesqueworkerscode and added the following worker classp  precode newjobworker.rb class NewJobMailer   queue  newjobs    def self.performid     sm  WorkerMailer.jobpostedid   end end codepre  pIn codeJobsControllercreatecode I added the following codep  precodeResque.enqueueNewJobMailer, job.id  send emails in the background codepre  pIn my terminal I have the redis server running, and I ran the coderake resquework QUEUEcode command in one of my tabs per the Railscast instructions.p  pIve restarted my server and tried creating a job several times. Nothing breaks during app initialization. But in my Resque dashboard I can see that every job is failing with the following errorp  precodeSQLite3IOException disk IO error SELECT jobs.

For some reason it seems as though the Resque queue doesnt have access to my models, but I thought adding codetask resquesetup gt environmentcode in coderesque.rakecode was supposed to account for that. At the same time, since the db call is technically not in the Resque worker, Im not sure that Im identifying the problem correctly. p  pCan anyone point me in the right directionp

Negative 11373 pIm writing a webapp to parse Excel files, each contains a lot of data 47 columns and thousands of rows. The framework is Laravel 4.2 and the package used is laravelexcel maatwebsiteexcel.p  pWhen I wrote all the code, I had a sample file from the customer, it contained 620 rows and everything worked fine. Now, some files work and most of them do not. The errors are strange. Ok, step by stepp  h2Logich2  pA user selects a file via codeltinput typefilegtcode, then this file is sent to the server via code.ajaxcode, the server creates a codeJobcode instance with properties of this file and returns this instance to the client. Client receives this codeJobcode instance and sees if codeprogresscode for this codeJobcode emi.e. number of rows parsedem is lower than codetotalcode emi.e. total number of rowsem. If it is so, the client sends a request to the server to execute this codeJobcode emi.e. to parse a certain amount of rows more, e.g. 200em. So there is always a dialogue between the client and server, something like thisp  ul listrongClientstrong Dear Server, hereby I upload this file codeorders123.xlsxcode.li listrongServerstrong Dear Client, thank you, I stored your file and created a codeJobcode with codeid  27code.

Negative 11373 pThis is a corner case I am trying to solve I have a navigation panel on the left, and a content panel on the right. Mouseenter on each nav item on the left fires a corresponding change to the contents of the right panel. So far so good. The contents contain a link, so we want the user to be able to place their mouse over the right contents panel. BUT if I use a mouseleave event on each nav, then every move to the right loses the custom content and fires the default content. If I have NO mouseleave events, the interaction is good, it is OK to leave the last content panel up...except for certain nonnav exits that have no mouseenter defined... which leaves the content panel blank. For those I want the default content, but in a catchall way. I need a command like watch for the next mouseenter event, and if you dont see one, uh, panic and put up the default contentp

Negative 11373 pI have a list which utilizes the Ext.plugin.SortableList drag n drop list ordering and ive saved the sort order to local storage by keeping track of a custom order property o that ive added to each record 1,2,3,4 etc.p  pHowever, i have other stores actually 3 others that load data from a service no control over and require the order to be the same as the one stored in localstorage detailed above.p  pMy naive approach is to do a comparison on each of the stores load and add the order number to each of the records.p  pIs this the best solution to this problem or can someone suggest a more efficient way It just feels intensive to this for each store load.p  pThanks, any suggestions greatly appreciatedp

Negative 11373 pI am working on a spreadsheet and I want to be able to filter by the converted sum of a cell.  For example, my cell has 5B and I want it to evaluate to 6.

Negative 11373 pI am attempting to eliminate the issue of Security Roles being dropped when changing a Users Business Unit in CRM 2011.  I have taken a few approaches with varying degrees of success, but none provide a seamless solution. So far a combination of plugins seems to be the best way.   p  pThe challenge is this The Security Roles are dropped after the prevalidation stage, but before the preoperation stage.  I am able to capture the users security roles in the original Business Unit when I register my plugin on the prevalidation stage if I execute an update other than changing the Business Unit, but the prevalidation plugin does not get triggered when running a Change Business Unit Update the first stage that occurs is preoperation.  I need to execute the prevalidation plugin when updating the users Business Unit.  Once I get the name of the security role, I can store it in the PluginExecutionContext shared variables, then in my poststage event plugin, I can query for the new security role with the correct name that is associated with my new Business Unit that part of the code is working.  p  pHas anyone either figured out how to p  pa transfer a users security roles from the original BU to a new one using plugins or notp  pOR p  pb trigger a plugin registered on the prevalidation stage for a Change Users Business Unit actionp

Negative 11373 pMy team and I have been struggling with this for a few hours and we have reached a conclusion... There is no good, comprehensive, uptodate, and generic documentation for OAuth 2.0.p  pGiven any API with authorization points x.comauthorizenew, x.comauthorizetoken, etc how does one write something to make appropriate calls to get a token, deal with the token, and apply the returned token to calls p  pIn case it has any relevance the API were trying to access is the Basecamp API, but a more generic approach would be better for anyone else looking at this for a solution.p  pAdditionally, which oAuth library would you suggest Weve looked at DotNetOpenAuth but the documentation on it is patchy and were not interested in the serverside dealings. We are not interested in developing anything serverside, just accessing and dealing with the data on the server via its API.p  pThanks.p

Negative 11373 pI was working on a D3 map, and indicated several large cities in the U.S. using circle SVG elements. Pretty standard.
