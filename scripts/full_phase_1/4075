Positive 4075 pDisclaimer hobby coder having fun learning. Apologies for any terrible jargon errors  please tell me the proper names for these things as that really helps my attempts to selfeducate.p  pI am trying to define a database of things using Python and MySQL actually CloudSQL  Im doing this on AppEngine. These things are heterogeneous  e.g some have common properties, but many have unique properties. I thought this might be a sensible way to store stuffp  precodetable things    thingid      propertyid      value           1              1            foo           1              2            blue          2              1            bar           2              3            large     table properties     propertyid      propertydefinition             1            name                          2            color                         3            size                   codepre  pThis way my objects can be of variable width  e.g some will have ten properties, some will just have a name  but I dont have a big table full of empty columns. I am pretty sure this is the right thing to do.p  pThe confusing bit is getting these things out of my weird, nested table and into Python. I can conceptually load each row as an instantiation of a single master class with optional attributes, but then Im redefining all of my properties and their definitions, some of them will need to be optional... it seems inelegant to have to define everything twice.p  pI think the  solution to this is using SQL alchemy but I cant get my head around how this works with my deep vs wide table structure. Can somebody help me out, even with some pseudo code for my above example Id like to pull my two deconstructed objects, reconstruct them and print the available properties  which, crucially, are going to change for each object.p  pIf this doesnt make sense please let me know and I will try to rephrase. Sorry for what I assume is a really basic question, I cant imagine Im the first beginner to hit this issue p

Positive 4075 pI figured I could find answer to this on the internet somewhere, but I seem to have missed it. You can query a table for all rows where an array column contains a specific valuep  precodeMyModel.query.filterMymodel.arrayField.contains[someValue] codepre  pAnd you can put in multiple values such that the array must contain strongallstrong the specified valuesp  precodeMyModel.query.filterMymodel.arrayField.contains[someValue, anotherValue] codepre  pBut what about querying and where the array contains strongatleast onestrong of the specified values.  That is, a query that would return rows where codearrayFieldcode contains codesomeValuecode or codeanotherValuecode, and maybe both but not necessarily both.p  pHow would I do thatp

Positive 4075 pIve been tinkering with this for hours now and I just cant seem to find a way to make this work. It seems like it should be simple, and Im sure it is, but Im stumpled.p  pI have one module called server.py that handles all of the routing with bottle, this is the main point of execution.

The best idea I have come up with so far is to wrap my entire db.py in a class and have the constructor create the session.

In my data structure this make sense. But maybe it break a SQLRDBMSrulep  pWhen I do this in Python3 with the object it causes an error because SQLAlchemy try to execute an DELETE statement for that.p  precodea.bbb.clear codepre  pThe errorp  precodeDELETE FROM abrelation WHERE abrelation.aoid   AND abrelation.boid   1, 1 ROLLBACK sqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError DELETE statement on table abrelation expected to delete 1 rows Only 2 were matched. codepre  pThe error make sense for me in that case.

It is about making usage statistic for a gym. p  pYou walk to a machine and lift some kilograms a couple of times  that is called codeTrainingUnitcode what is equivalent to codeAcode in the example. For warming up you make 12 repetitions and lift up 35 kg in each of them  that is called a codeSetSetcode equivalent to codeBcode in the example keep in mind that codeSetcode is a reserved SQLkeyword. Then you make a oneminutebreak and do 12 repetitions with 40 kg  the second set. And you do a third again with 12 repetitions and 40 kg again. So the codeTrainingUnitcode instancerow need three relations to instancesrows of codeSetSetcode.

Negative 4075 pI have a class A that implements IEquatablelt, using its fields say, A.b and A.c for implementingoverriding Equals and overriding GetHashCode, and everything works fine, 99 of the time. Class A is part of a hierarchy class B, C that all inherit from interface D they can all be stored together in a dictionary Dictionary, thus its convenient when they all carry their own default EqualsGetHashCode.p  pHowever, while constructing A I sometime need to do some work to get the values for A.b and A.c while thats happening, I want to store a reference to the instance thats being built. In that case, I dont want to use the default EqualsGetHashCode overrides provided by A.

Negative 4075 pI am currently working on a light php framework to use with some high request ajax for my site, and have run into an interesting problem that has me completely stumped. The ajax is for a series of notifications, so the javascript sends off an ajax request for new information every 30 seconds. This ajax is active on every page of the entire site, so I realize its a lot of requests as several hundred users are browsing the site at any given moment, many with several windows open.p  pSyntax wise everything is perfect. The problem is, when I activated the ajax for my community, there is a build up of 30  40 SLEEP commands in the MySQL database. All of which seem to ignore the set timeout of 10 seconds. It effects the entire sites performance as a result. p  pMy understanding is that left over sleep commands are the result of a connection that hasnt been closed. I am use the MySQLi object oriented class and have extended it with a few functions of my own. Everything is by the text book and double checked against the documentation, and Ive made sure that every little piece of the MySQLi class is closed and released. p  pIf anyone has any wisdom or experience with this type of effect, I would be most grateful for any advice.p

Negative 4075 pI came across a subtle bug a couple of days ago where the code looked something like thisp  precodeostringstream ss int anInt 7   ss ltlt anInt ltlt HABITS ss ltlt ends string theWholeLot  ss.str codepre  pThe problem was that the codeendscode was sticking a 0 into the codeostringstreamcode so codetheWholeLotcode actually looked like code7HABITS0code i.e. a null at the endp  pNow this hadnt shown up because codetheWholeLotcode was then being used to take the codeconst char code portion using codestringcstrcode That meant that the null was masked as it became just a delimiter. However, when this changed to use strings throughout, the null suddenly meant something and comparisons such asp  precodeif  theWholeLot  7HABITS  codepre  pwould fail. This got me thinking Presumably the reason for codeendscode is a throwback to the days of codeostrstreamcode when the stream was not normally terminated with a null and had to be so that codestrcode which then cast out not a codestringcode but a codechar code would work correctly.p  pHowever, now that its not possible to cast out a codechar code from a codeostringstreamcode, using codeendscode is not only superfluous, but potentially dangerous and Im considering removing them all from my clients code.p  pCan anyone see an obvious reason to use codeendscode in a codestdstringcode only environmentp

Negative 4075 pWe recently put out an update of one of our apps with a test DLL from a third party. The third party does not update their assembly versions on the dlls, only the file versions, so multiple apps can reference different versions of it. However, the GAC still allows us to keep the newest version, because it also checks the file version which is always updated. p  pWhat happened is we were not ready to release this DLL, but it got out there on some customer machines. I would like to put our current live version back out there, but it has an older file version and the same assembly version as the test DLL. We have multiple apps referencing this DLL, so I cant simply delete it and drop in the new one. p  pIs there a way to replace the DLL in the GAC Im using installshield 2009.

Negative 4075 pSo, per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions444251howtostorealistinadbcolumnMehrdads answer to a related questiona, I emget item that a proper database table column doesnt store a list.  Rather, you should create another table that effectively holds the elements of said list and then link to it directly or through a junction table.  However, the type of list I want to create will be composed of unique items unlike the linked questions emfruitem example.  Furthermore, the items in my list are explicitly sorted  which means that if I stored the elements in another table, Id have to sort them every time I accessed them.  Finally, the list is basically atomic in that any time I wish to access the list, I will want to access the entire list rather than just a piece of it  so it seems silly to have to issue a database query to gather together pieces of the list.p  pAKXs solution linked above is to serialize the list and store it in a binary column.  But this also seems inconvenient because it means that I have to worry about serialization and deserialization.  p  pIs there any better solution  If there emisem no better solution, then why  It seems that this problem should come up from time to time.p  p... just a little more info to let you know where Im coming from.  As soon as I had just begun understanding SQL and databases in general, I was turned on to LINQ to SQL, and so now Im a little spoiled because I expect to deal with my programming object model without having to think about how the objects are queried or stored in the database.p  pThanks Allp  pJohnp  pUPDATE  So in the first flurry of answers Im getting, I see you can go the CSVXML route... but DONT.  So now Im looking for explanations of why.  Point me to some good references.  p  pAlso, to give you a better idea of what Im up to  In my database I have a Function table that will have a list of x,y pairs.  The table will also have other information that is of no consequence for our discussion.  I will never need to see part of the list of x,y pairs.  Rather, I will take all of them and plot them on the screen.  I will allow the user to drag the nodes around to change the values occasionally or add more values to the plot.p

Negative 4075 pIm having trouble figuring out this issue Im having with cookies and asp.net applications.p  pA webservice is used to get user info with the following method callp  pGetUsertokenp  pThe token parameter comes from a cookie named token.  A user visits the website, and a token cookie is created.  The website needs to interract with a thirdparty application in the same domain, so they share the token cookie, and the thirdparty app will make the GetUser call with the token.p  pFor some reason the thirdparty app is expecting the prefix token in the cookies value.p  pIf the token cookies value is ABC123, the call doesnt work, but if I manually edit the content of the cookie so the value is tokenABC123  then it works.  However, I know the webservice method is still being called as GetUserABC123  even though token seems to be in the value.p  pWhy does the thirdparty app seem to need the cookies name in the value to actually workp

Negative 4075 pIm attempting to create an ASP.NETC page that runs a PowerShell script that will run an .exe installer.  The ASP.NET page is currently running in IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003. The PowerShell script works correctly from the PS command line but when invoked from the ASP.NET page the page just hangs.  No processes are created and it appears that the server just appears to hang forever.  I have successfully gotten other PowerShell scripts that run simple Cmdlets or other scripts to work from the ASP.NET page.p  pIve verified that the Website has script and execute permissions and that the ASP.NET page can see the script on disk.  When I run the script on the command line I am an Admin user, Ive checked the user in the ASP.NET page and its running as the NT AUTHORITYNETWORK SERVICE user.  I gave that user full permissions to execute the script but there was no change.p  pI feel like the issue is 1. User permissions which I am still a novice on in Windows.  2. Some prompt is being given to execute the script that I am not answering, however no Windows or prompts are displayed when this is run from the ASP.NET page, the installer is shown when running the script from the command line.p

Negative 4075 pIve come across some problems using Hibernate 3.4 on JBoss 5.1. Hibernate 3.4 is a JPA 1.0 implementation so it should be fine to be used in JBoss 5.1. The thing is JBoss has its own version of Hibernate, which is located at commonlib whereas I dont want to use the version provided by JBoss. What I did was that I removed the hibernateannotations.jar, hibernatecommonsannotations.jar, hibernatecore.jar, hibernateentitymanager.jar, hibernatejmx.jar and hibernatevalidator.jar from that folder and put my Hibernate 3.4 jars into serverdefaultlib directory.

Negative 4075 pIm looking for some smart ideas on how to quickly find all usage of session state within an existing asp.net MVC application.p  pThe application in question was the subject of outsourced development, and has been running fine in production.

However, when we deployed to production, we suddenly experienced a large number of errors.

If I had full control over the code, this is the kind of place where Id just comment out the class to compile and find the various ways of reaching the session class, then comment out the accessors, hit compile, and visit each error.

Negative 4075 pI understood from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1494735cinitializationorderofstaticfieldsinstaticclass14947451494745this answera that C static field initializers are executed... prior to the first use of a static field of that class, but that still produces results I didnt expect, at least with generic types.p  pComing from the Java world, I was missing my rich enums, and I thought with Cs more serious generics that I ought to be able to replicate them with a minimum of boilerplate. Here stripped of some details, like comparability is what I came up withp  precodepublic class AbstractEnumltTgt where T  AbstractEnumltTgt      static readonly IDictionaryltString, Tgt nameRegistry  new DictionaryltString, Tgt      readonly String name      protected AbstractEnum String name              this.name  name         nameRegistry[name]  T this           public String Name          get              return name                    public static T ValueOfString name          return nameRegistry[name]           public static IEnumerableltTgt Values          get              return nameRegistry.Values                codepre  pAnd some example subclassesp  precodepublic class SomeEnum  AbstractEnumltSomeEnumgt       public static readonly SomeEnum V1  new SomeEnumV1     public static readonly SomeEnum V2  new SomeEnumV2      SomeEnumString name  basename          public class OtherEnum  AbstractEnumltOtherEnumgt       public static readonly OtherEnum V1  new OtherEnumV1     public static readonly OtherEnum V2  new OtherEnumV2      OtherEnumString name  basename         codepre  pThis looks good and more or less does the trick... except that, following the letter of the spec, the actual instances codeSomeEnum.V1code, codeOtherEnum.V1code etc. dont get initialized unless at least one of them is referred to explicitly. Static fieldsmethods in the base class dont count. So, for instance, the followingp  precodeConsole.WriteLineCount 0, SomeEnum.Values.Count foreach SomeEnum e in SomeEnum.Values      Console.WriteLinee.Name  codepre  pwrites codeCount 0code, but if I add the following line p  precodeConsole.WriteLineSomeEnum.V1   SomeEnum.V1.Name codepre  p even emafterem the above, I getp  precodeCount 2 V1 V2 codepre  pNote, by the way, that initializing the instances in a static constructor makes no difference.p  pNow, I can fix this by marking codenameRegistrycode as codeprotectedcode and pushing codeValuescode and codeValueOfcode down into the subclasses, but I was hoping to keep all the complexity in the superclass and keep the boilerplate to a minimum.

Negative 4075 pI have a small piece of code, where i have used a POSIX timer timercreate . The timer is created using the signal approach SIGEVSIGNAL  as SIGEVTHREAD not supported on our platform. When the timer expires, it generates a signal, SIGUSR1, to notify of its expiration, and there is a corresponding handler, to catch this signal, inside this handler in actual program, not shown on code i have a flag which sets, once the signal given by timer is caught.p  pUptill this, everything is fine strongProblem is, suppose if the test program also generates same signal as the timer SIGUSR1 in this case, then the same flag is set, not by timer.

Negative 4075 pWe have a very big C solution with several projects for which intellisense works perfectly in Visual Studio 2008, but not at all in Visual Studio 2010 not even for structs defined in the same file where they are used.  Ive verified that intellisense does work in VS 2010 for other projects on my machine.  Ive tried importing one of the problematic projects from a brandnew solution with no success.  Rebuilding the project files from scratch seems promising, but it would require days of work to follow that path, with no guarantee of success at the end.  Any alternative suggestions are welcome.

Negative 4075 pI have created a WCF PublishSubscribe service using WSDualHTTPBinding.

Negative 4075 pI need to do some web scraping. After playing around with different web testing framework, of which most where either too slow Selenium or too buggy for my needs env.js, I decided that a hrefhttpzombie.labnotes.orgzombie.jsa looks most promising, as it uses a solid set of libraries for HTML parsing and DOM manipulation. However, it seems to me like it doesnt even support basic eventbased Javascript code like in the following web pagep  precodelthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegttestlttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt        console.logtest script executing...       console.logregistering callback for event DOMContentLoaded on   document        document.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, function         console.logDOMContentLoaded triggered       , false        function loaded          console.logonload triggered             ltscriptgt   ltheadgt    ltbody onloadloadedgt     lth1gtTestlth1gt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pI then decided to trigger those events manually like thisp  precodezombie  requirezombie  zombie.visithttplocalhost4567,  debug true , function err, browser, status     doc  browser.document   console.logfiring DOMContentLoaded on   doc   browser.fireDOMContentLoaded, doc, function err, browser, status       body  browser.querySelectorbody     console.logfiring load on   body     browser.fireload, body, function err, browser, status         console.logbrowser.html            codepre  pWhich works for this particular test page. My problem is a more general one, though I want to be able to scrape more complex, AJAXbased sites like a friends list on Facebook something like a hrefhttpwww.facebook.comprofile.phpid100000028174850ampskfriendsampvfriendshttpwww.facebook.comprofile.phpid100000028174850ampskfriendsampvfriendsa. It is no problem to log into the site using zombie, but some content like those lists seem to be completely loaded dynamically using AJAX, and I dont know how to trigger the event handlers that initiate the loading. p  pThere are several questions I have regarding this problemp  ul liHas somebody already implemented a similarly complex scraper without using a browser remotecontrolling solution like Seleniumli liIs there some reference on the loading process of a complex Javascriptbased pageli liCan somebody provide advice on how to debug a real browser to see what I might need to execute to trigger the Facebook event handlersli liAny other ideas about this topicli ul  pAgain, please do not point me to solutions involving controlling a real browser like Selenium, as I know about those. What is however welcome are suggestions for a real inmemory renderer like WebKit accessible from the Ruby scripting language, but preferrably with the possibility to set cookies and preferrably also load raw HTML instead of triggering real HTTP requests.p

Negative 4075 pMy question is mostly about OOP and ORM design. Im creating models in Zend for Users and Groups, and using mappers for the db and also using dependency injection. I have a relational table, codeusergroupscode, for linking. Im trying to figure out the best way to go about getting and setting a users groups, or a groups users. I am currently looking at 3 options, let me know if Im forgetting somethingp  ol liTake care of joining db tables in mapper so users groups look like part of the User modelli liAdd a UserGroupsMapper create functions like useraddToGroupgroupli liAdd a UserGroupsMapper emandem UserGroup model create functions like userGroupadduser, groupli ol  hr  pThoughts about option 1 p  pIs there supposed to be a onetoone relationship between models and db tables, or can one model represent multiple tables If so, when would it not be ok Another example If I have a codecolorcode table and a codecolortypecode table with things like warm or cool as rows, does Color contain the colorType as an attributeinstance variable Or does it reference ColorType as an object by means of codecolortypeidcode, or does it have an actual ColorType object as an ivar p  hr  pThoughts about option 2 p  pFor a function like useraddToGroupgroup, would it call the UserMapper method, which then calls the method in the UserGroupsMapper, or would it call the method in the UserGroupsMapper directly From my understanding, the mapper is supposed to abstract the model from the data, but what does that mean as far as relationships between models Are the models supposed to know how they are linked, or just the mappersp  hr  pThoughts about option 3 p  pAdding a UserGroup model creates the possibility of accessing that model in a controller. Should the Group controller know the model relationships, like userGroup objects, or should it only be able to do things like tell a group to add a userp  hr  pI hope the question is clear enough. I know it is pretty involved, but I havent been able to find a good answer yet.p

A stronger argument for that conclusion is that the results on Windows look distinctly weirdp  precode     cumulative   self              self     total             time   seconds   seconds    calls  uscall  uscall  name      27.43      1.13     1.13 68589813     0.02     0.02  addt  21.48      2.02     0.89                             tok  19.17      2.81     0.79                             hash   9.95      3.21     0.41                             slot   7.89      3.54     0.33                             nextx   4.85      3.74     0.20                             next   3.52      3.88     0.14 27809047     0.01     0.01  get   0.85      3.92     0.04                             eol   0.73      3.95     0.03                             mingwpformat   0.73      3.98     0.03                             ch   0.73      4.01     0.03                             tokx   0.49      4.03     0.02                             slot   0.49      4.05     0.02                             tok   0.24      4.06     0.01   166896     0.06     0.06  mk2   0.24      4.07     0.01     6693     1.49     1.49  initt   0.24      4.08     0.01                             pformatputchars   0.24      4.09     0.01                             hashs   0.24      4.10     0.01                             pop   0.24      4.11     0.01                             quoted   0.12      4.12     0.01                             eat   0.12      4.12     0.01                             expand   0.00      4.12     0.00 145841014     0.00     0.00  initparse codepre  pThere are a lot of gaps, and then codeinitparsecode, which is an initialization function called only once that calls almost nothing else, is reported as having been called one hundred and fortyfive million times.p  pShould I disregard the results from Windows and just use the ones from Linux Or is there some issue with the reporting of number of calls on Windows that doesnt affect the percentage time results Or am I misreading the output or otherwise misusing the toolp

Negative 4075 pI have just using WatiN.  My company uses the jQuery show and hide functions to display error messages.  I want to make sure that these messages appear at the correct times. I have been using a test script from a jQuery download which uses show and hide. I added id values to the div tag and to one of the enclosed scan tags. I have been unable to detect in my code when the message is being displayed.  p  pI have included below both both the jQuery script and my code.  The script has two buttons, one for displaying and one for hiding a message.  My code hits the hide button and examines the visibility and width attributes and then hits the show button and looks at the same attributes.  I can see on the screen that the text is indeed being hidden and then shown. When I set break points, in both cases the visibility is set to inherited and the width is set to auto.

Negative 4075 pIm thinking through how to develop a validation on my Rails app that essentially checks to make sure that the credit card used for any given transaction by any user is unique in our system, such that all credit card may be used to purchase an item only strongoncestrong across the entire application for all users, for all time.p  pThe thinking behind this restriction is that this app will sometimes run timesensitive promotional deals, and we want to do our best to institute a one purchase per credit card system for these deals.p  pI was thinking of hashing the credit card number and just storing that hash in the db, then crossreferencing it at the time of each new purchase so my payment gateway keeps the actual number, and I just keep a hash in the DB, but a hrefhttpwww.integrigy.comsecurityresourceswhitepapersIntegrigyHashingCreditCardNumbersUnsafePractices.pdf relnofollowon further research, this seems like a bad ideaa.p  pSo Im back to the drawing board and looking for new ideas. Anyone know a good approach to this problem, while keeping as PCIcompliant as I can bep  pIm developing with Rails 3 and using ActiveMerchant to integrate with my payment gateway, Authorize.net, if that helps at all.p

Negative 4075 pI have just started learning asp.net mvc and one reason of the primary reasons has been to move to TDD. p  pI am writing a small dashboard application which has reports. In this app, I had a primary controller called ReportsController, which right now has just one method, GetReport that takes in a query and returns a view if the query meets certain conditions, else returns an error message. p  precode[HttpGet] public ActionResult GetReportstring query          calls the QueueRep and gets back DataTable     ReportQuery reportQuery  new ReportQueryquery     if reportQuery.IsValidQuery              queryRepository.ExecuteReportQueryref reportQuery                          else              return ViewError                     ViewData.AddResultDataTable,reportQuery.ResultDataTable      return View codepre  pp  pI had written 2 unit tests for this as followsp  precodepublic void GetReportShouldReturnErrorViewForMaliciousQuery      Arrange     string query  drop table userInfo     var controller  CreateReportsControllerquery      Act     var result  controller.GetReportquery as ViewResult      Assert     Assert.AreEqualresult.ViewName, Error    [Test] public void GetReportShouldReturnViewWithDataTableForCorrectQuery      Arrange     StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder      sb.AppendSELECT YearCreatedOn as Year, MonthCreatedOn as Month, CountCREATEDON as NewEmployers     sb.AppendFROM dbo.UserInfo WHERE DefaultPurpose  1 GROUP BY YearCreatedOn, MonthCreatedOn      string query  sb.ToString      var controller  CreateReportsControllerquery      Act      var result  controller.GetReportquery as ViewResult      Assert      Assert.IsTrueresult.ViewData.ContainsKeyResultDataTable     Assert.IsTrueresult.ViewData[ResultDataTable].GetType  typeofSystem.Data.DataTable   codepre  pNow, due to conflict with SSRS, the serverReports was pointing to SSRS instead of Reports controller so I changed name of ReportsController to MyReportsController.

Basically, the folder name of the views had to be changed from Reports to MyReports. How can I test these kind of scenarios.

If I use canvas.darwLinep1.x, p1.y,p2.x,p2.y,paint the app freezes and the app becomes unusable. using a clipping doesnt solve the problem, the drawing engine is still trying to draw the pixels to the whole way to the second pointp  pAny suggestions or a workaroundp

Negative 4075 pI recently got a small Railsproject going to help me learn the environment and the associated languagestools that go with it Ruby, Cucumber, RSpec, Haml....p  pWhat got me stuck recently is that I decided to go from a hrefhttpsgithub.comlinduxedeveminsrailsblob0aebf4e97ea1ae4f73afe6523442aadda2b686a2featuresminerconvertsminerals.feature relnofollowone scenarioa to multiple as seen in a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1860646 relnofollowthis gista. When I introduced the second scenario, I noticed that the total values of the mineral piles were not summarized, this caused by the fact that the step definition for I have mined  of that mineral looked like thisp  precodeGiven I have mined [] of that mineral do amount   visitrootpath   fillinmineral.name, with gt amount end codepre  pThe culprit was obviously the visitrootpath call which reset the already filled in fields as soon as a new field was to be filled in. Important to note is however that apart from the fact the Total value  failed at the end, all of the tests were green.p  pI decided that since all of the stuff done in this feature requires one to be on the indexroot page Ill probably change this later on Ill just put it into a codeBackgroundcode block. The corresponding step definition is nothing more than that visitrootpath line extracted into its own step.p  pThis however has resulted in every fillin call to fail with the following or something very similarp  precodecannot fill in, no text field, text area or password field with id, name, or label tritanium found CapybaraElementNotFound eval2in fillin .featuresstepdefinitionsminerconvertsminerals.rb12in I have mined d of that mineral featuresminerconvertsminerals.feature12in And I have mined ltamountgt of that mineral codepre  pMy take on this is that for some reason the visiting of the page in codeBackgroundcode isnt persistent, and it forgets that it got there... for some reason. Note that as mentioned above it all stops working as soon as visitrootpath is moved out of the I have mined...step into a separate step, leading me to guess that visit must be done inside the same block, but I could be wrong.p  pstrongEDITstrong I tried using the codesaveandopenpagecode method to view what is actually displayed on this page that Capybara cant find the elements on. It turns out that the Calculate button is there, but none of the fields in the table are there. It looks like the problem lies in the fact that the fields are not generated.p  pI think all of the relevant code for solving this can be found in above mentioned gist. Thanks for readingp

Negative 4075 pthis is kind of a strange title, so let me explainp  pWe have a web application PHP, Zend Framework that is quite successfull. Over time traffic grew and performance degraded tens of requests with 80ms to tenthousands requests with 600ms average. We didnt expect so much traffic when first designing the application, so no big surprise. We decided to look into many things that could improve the performance.p  pAfter some days into the effort a production bug appeared that needed to be fixed. As the first changes we made to clean up some queries and caching code were already done and tested, we figured we could just add these to the update. None of the changes really improved the performance much in local testing and staging, but anyway.p  pBut yeah, it did on production. Our graphes plunged to almost zero and we were totally destroyed that the update somehow made all the traffic disappear. But as we looked closer, the graphs were back to 80ms and almost invisible next to the 600ms mountains p  pSo we totally fixed the performance problems with some changes, we didnt even think would make a difference. Total success, but of course we want to understand which of these changes made the difference.p  pHow would you tackle this problemp  pSome backgroundp  ul liPHP application using Zend Framework, MySQL as database, Memcache for caching.li liWe get our performance graphs and insight into the application from NewRelic.com, but I cant really find the reason of the better performance there.li liUsing jMeter we could reproduce the bad performance on our dev servers, and also more or less the better performance of the updated version.li ul  pThe only idea I have right now is to start with the old version, loadtest it, add one commit, loadtest it, add another feature, loadtest it... but this doesnt sound any fun or very effective.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong We found the reason for the performance problems, I will add an answer later to explain what we did and what the reason was.

Negative 4075 pI have a friend that is making a portfolio site. He has some high res images that he would like to display. There will be multiple projects on one page, and several images per project. Because of this, he would like to reduce load time as much as possible, and also conserve system memory usage. That being said, hes afraid that a conventional jQuery slider will eat up too much memory if its called multiple times on the same page. Also, to load all of the images at initialization is just not an option as this would create long load times. Does anyone know of any image sliders, either jQuery or HTML5, or both that can help with thisp

Is it acceptablesecure to store it in a cookieli ul  pThank you very much in advance.p  pBest regardsp

I guess that come from the fact that the address of memblock with or without offset will always return the address of the continuous memory block.p  pThe problem with that is that I wanted to implement some sort of DynamicHeap class where you could allocate memory of arbitary size and free it in arbitary order. The class uses a memory block like memblock above which will be replaced by a bigger memory block once the memory block is full. The problem with that is that I need to keep track of all objects that use memory of the DynamicHeap class because once I allocate a bigger block to replace it with the old block I need to reassign all pointers that are used by my programs. I wanted to do this via pointers to the memory I return when my programs want to get memory from the DynamicHeap class.

Negative 4075 pI am creating a NSManagedObject subclass with certain attributes. At the same time, I am executing some codea block that does some network operation given the attributes of my NSManagedObject. Now, some times that network operation might fail or take too long, so I want to add the ability to cancel the execution of that codeblock.p  pI was thinking of making the codeblock an NSThread, and then I have the ability to call [theThread cancel]. However, how do I associate the NSThread with my NSManagedObject, given that I cannot add properties to NSManagedObject Categories Is it OK to just add the property to the definition of the NSManagedObject itself Seems legal, but subsequent changes to the Core Data model would overwrite my code, I guess.p  pBut maybe there is an entirely different and better way to accomplish what I am trying to do Any ideasp

Negative 4075 pI think Ive found a bug in Cakes FormHelper class, but maybe Im just not using the correct function, so hopefully somebody on here knows.  Heres the relevant codep  precodeltphp     echo thisgtFormgtinputfirstname, arrayvalue gtFirst Name, label gt false gt codepre  ppAs you can see, Im just outputting an input text field that has a default value of First Name.  The issue Im experiencing is that if the user does not provide a valid name, then the form does not preserve the value that the user tried to submit with, instead it just shows the default value again First Name. So basically, if I were to enter into the field hey123 and then click submit, the form will show the appropriate validation error message next to the text field, but the text field itself wont contain my previous entry of hey123, it will show the First Name text again. pIs it possible to have the input field show the default value initially while also allowing whatever the user entered into the form to be preserved when validation errors occur So in the previous example, instead of showing the First Name text on the error validation page, itd show my original entry that caused the issue, hey123.p

And it would be easy to only write one more class that would inspect images, and then I could just upload images, and get their information right from the folders without a need for relation database.p  pAnd now the question you all been waiting for is ... p  pWhat would be faster, first or second solution Lets say that site gets loads of traffic.  What solution would be better if I want it to be fast, and not to stress server to muchp

Negative 4075 pI have a codeDataGridViewcode with a custom codeDataGridViewColumncode. The column is hosting a thirdparty component. I enter edit mode in the cell and modify its value and then I press enter key to validate the value. The problem is that I have to press enter key twice to validate the value. It seems like first enter key is to validate the value in the thirdpartys editor hosted in the cell, and second one to validate the codeDataGridViewcodes cell... So how to validate cells value with only pressing enter key one time p  pAlso I have seen strange behaviour, for example, the last codeDataGridViewcodes row does not behaves as the rest of the codeDataGridViewcodes cells. For last row, if I edit the value of a cell and then press enter key to validate, after validating value, it always remains in the same cell and in edit mode and cells value gets selected so user can think that cell value is invalid when in fact it isnt. This does not happen with the rest of the rows. They need to press enter key twice to validate and cells do not remain in edit mode after validating.p  pstrongEDITstrong Regarding to the need to press enter key twice In the custom cell, when enter key is pressed for first time, it raises the event that says value for the cell has changed, it is in this case, OnSourceValueChanged this is the event raised for the thirdparty when value has changed so into it I dop  precode        this.valueChanged  true         this.EditingControlDataGridView.NotifyCurrentCellDirtytrue         base.OnSourceValueChangede codepre  pwhen executed NotifyCurrentCellDirty it raises CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged on datagridview which code isp  precode            if this.gridView.IsCurrentCellDirty                      this.gridView.CurrentCell.DataGridView.EndEditDataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit             this.gridView.EndEditDataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit          codepre  pAfter it, DataError event is raised for the datagridview but cell continues in edit mode so I would like to commit the value and exit edit mode. How to do this Also I have triedp  precodethis.dataGridView.CurrentCell.DataGridView.EndEditDataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit codepre  pthis.dataGridView.EndEditDataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commitp  pin DataError handler but it does not work.p  pFinally, cellvaluechanged is not raised maybe as it is a hosted control in the cell...I dont understand why I have to press enter key twice to commit and validate changes on the cell and exit edit mode for the cell. I want only to press enter key press once.p  pMaybe the cause is that an error is occurred after commit in CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged. DataError event is raised reporting an commit error. Also, how to avoid commit error What is happeningp

Negative 4075 pI have a Java web app WAR that requires an older 1.5.11 version of the JRE, but am on Linux and spent a good deal of time setting up my environment for 1.6.34.p  pThe web app needs to be hosted locally on JBoss 4.0.4 GA, which I have no experience with. Im wondering if it is possible to download the 1.5.11 version of the JDK and configure things so that my JBoss instance is the only thing on my system that is using it. This way I dont need to worry about blowing out any of my other configs for 1.6.34.p  pIf it is possible, what are the general steps and what are the JBoss configs I need to make Thanks in advance.p

Negative 4075 pPyOpenGL docs sayp  blockquote   pBecause of the way OpenGL and ctypes handle, for instance, pointers, to array data, it is often necessary to ensure that a Python datastructure is retained i.e. not garbage collected.  This is done by storing the data in an array of datavalues that are indexed by a contextspecific key.  The functions to provide this functionality are provided by the OpenGL.contextdata module.p blockquote  pWhen exactly is it the casep  pOne situation Ive got in my mind is clientside vertex arrays back from OpenGL 1, but they have been replaced by buffer objects for years.

Negative 4075 pIve never really done much web work, but for a project i have to write dynamic website in java.p  pSo originally i started using scriplets in the jsp combined with standard java classes to reduce the amount of code in the jsp files. This was working great for me and i was producing results very quickly.p  pHowever when i looked online i saw that this way was disregarded almost a decade ago.p  pSo i started looking into the JSTL libary and the the EL. However after searching for a very long while found it hard to wrap my head round and often got sidetracked with researching the benefits of JSF, pre processing servlets and much more. This project will never actually go into production it will be presented to someone along with my code.p  pSo my question is, what is the fastest and easiest way to display information from my database into a jsp while using standard java classes Which i am used to, and have already created to do the most of the work create connection etc.p  pI have goggled this endlessly and it has only made me more confused. Much of the infromation from google just involved variables from the pages scope or the request scope, not getting information from java classes.p  pThanks very much p

Negative 4075 pThe GWT module comes with some annoying quirks, one of which is departing from the the standard fontsize of code16pxcode and declaring it to be code12pxcode instead. I tried to declare individual fontsize for different elements, for the body itself, but they were always overridden by the default style.p  pSo I decided to use codeimportantcode to declare the default fontsize for the entire body. This works, problem is that it also applies to where it shouldnt, like codeh2code elements. Declaring another fontsize property for codeh2code with another codeimportantcode again doesnt override the one declared for the codebodycode element, even though it should.p  pSo is there any way to do this Same problem goes for the font family also, i cant override it without using codeimportantcode.p

Negative 4075 pI am having an issue with updating AppWidgets and a confluence of limitationsbugs in android is preventing me finding a workaround.p  pMy app widget is themeable so I need to be able to update the imageviews on it at runtime as well as the textviews and intents.  There are up to 9 imageviews that I am updating but the size of the graphics Im using are fairly modest max 11kb pngs. The total size of data I am pushing through the RemoteViews object should be under 100kb, well within the limit of 1mb.  I think that actual drawable resources on screen end up being larger in size than the original pngs, but 10 of the limit seems reasonable enough to account for that.  However, with certain phones and launchers, I am getting FAILED BINDER TRANSACTION errors.p  pThere are two solutions that I have found for thisp  p1 Use setImageViewUri which calls setImageURI instead of setImageViewResource with the RemoteViews object, this gets rid of sending drawables through the RemoteViews object and loads the image from URI instead.  Solves the memory error see a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicandroiddevelopersKKEyW6XdDvgdiscussion relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicandroiddevelopersKKEyW6XdDvgdiscussiona p  p2 Divide the updates to the app widget into multiple RemoteViews calls.  So I update 3 of the images, call updateAppWidget, create a new RemoteViews object, update the next 3 images, call updateAppWidget, etc.p  pThe problem with the 1st approach is that it only works for medium density devices.  All other devices scale the images incorrectly due to a bug in the android codebase see bug report a hrefhttpcode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid22590 relnofollowhttpcode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid22590a p  pThe problem with the 2nd approach is that when the screen orientation changes, android destroys and recreates widget views using the last RemoteViews call which it stores in some secret place.  This meams the appwidget doesnt get fully redrawn because I split my RemoteView calls up and the widget ends up unusable.  There appears to be no reliable way to figure out when android is destroying and recreating the appwidgets   onConfigurationChanged in the service doesnt always fire and no Activity level call is ever made ie. onUpdate, onReceive that I can find.  In order for the widgets to be able to be redrawn fully and correctly on orientation change, I can only use one RemoteViews updateAppWidget call so this solution wont work.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how to work around this  Im wondering if itd be possible to implement my own RemoteViews that called a nonbuggy setImageURI function in a custom ImageView class so that the scaling happened correctly.  It seems like a lot of work just update a few widgets and I am not sure android will let me extend RemoteViewsImageView that way.p  pIs there anyway to intercept android when the screen orientation changes and force it to redraw the whole widgetp  pWould love to hear any other suggestions or workaround ideas  Thanks.p

Negative 4075 pIn Doctrine2, is there a way to create a computed entity, that is based on the results of a complex sql queryp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIn an application that Im working on existed prior to my joining the project, there is a concept of attribute belongs to attribute, has many attribute, strongoverridesstrong attribute catalogItem belongs to catalogItem, has many catalogItem, has many attributep  pThe idea is that catalogItem has its own hierarchy, that currently goes up to 4 levels deep. Each catalogItem inherits the attributes of its parent, but those attributes which have their own hierarchy as well can be overridden at any point. This overridden hierarchy is then used by the immediate catalogItem, and its children as well, with the same ability existing to create overrides.p  pAs a result, the typical structure of direct associations is fairly useless here, since were always needing to see the computed endresult.p  pSo, my issue is, I would like to be able to inject these computed results into Doctrine2, which can then be used as standard entities, which ability to traverse relations, etc, as normal.p  pThis cant be done as a MySQL view, as performance drops. Additionally, the query that creates the computed result is fairly complex, and for performance, any filtering say, by X catalogItem occurs at both a 3rd level nested subquery, as well as the toplevel query, and the very existence of subqueries means a normal MySQL view is directly incompatible though there are workarounds.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pI would like to be able to create an entity in Doctrine2, for which instead of a table existing, the actual MySQL query would exist, and would be run as a subquery. I havent yet seen any way in Doctrine2 to achieve something like what Im describing, Im hoping someone can present a solution or workaround to achieve a similar resultp

Negative 4075 pTo verify that using http pipelining can optimize the speed of loading resources, I made a test as followsp  pOpen Firefox on Mac, in config change max connection per server to 1, then I open a test page which loads 12 images.

Negative 4075 pThis was very difficult for me to word into a question so allow me to explain.p  pI have an abstract class codeEntitycode and subclasses codeHousecode and codeWarehousecode. Each subclass has the same static variables with different values. p  pWhen a button is pressed in my game an codeActioncode is created which specifies which Entity subclass gets created and placed in the world. I want to write a generic method to place some codeEntitycode to the world using the static variables of which ever subclass it is. p  pI have a class codePlaceEntityActioncode and when the mouse is clicked the appropriate entity will be placed assuming conditions are correct. How can I pass the Class I want to be placed to this Action so it works with any generic codeEntitycodep  pHere is some dumbed down codep  precodeif mousePressed      if some conditions are true           int ex  x pos         int ey  y pos           if world.player.haveFundse.COSTENERGY, e.COSTMONEY,                     e.COSTRESOURCE              if world.places[ex][ey]  0                  world.entities.adde                 world.player.addEnergye.COSTENERGY                             codepre  pSo basically how can I get that codeecode to be whatever subclass I pass to the Action since COSTMONEY, etc is static and should be accessed by the Class and not an objectp  pIm really struggling to express what I want.

Negative 4075 pThis is a theoretical question that just occurred to me.p  pNormally when running an JMeter load test, I find the default heap settings are adequate.p  pSometimes when running an intensive JMeter load test, JMeter will throw an OutOfMemory exception, indicating it requires more heap normally.p  pIm concerned about the cases inbetween these two. If JMeter does emnotem throw an OutOfMemory, is there any way to reassure myself that garbagecollecting on JMeters side did not adversely affect the results Do I have to monitor the gc logs everytime I run JMeterp  pI suppose the more practical side of this is can I compare output from two separate JMeter tests where Jmeter used different heapsizesp  pEDIT One thing I have noticed, is that the Jmeter UI has an icon to indicate that the GC Overhead Limit has been breached. But this comes from the JVM and is triggered where 98 of CPU time is used doing GC and I reckon my results would be skewed long before I reach this point.p

Negative 4075 pI have a table, and Ive dynamically added  removed rows from it. The table contains fields that will be posted back as a collection to MVC. In this scenario updating the table with jquery means I up with collections that contain incomplete collections for example ...p  precodefunction add       .ajax             url GetRow,             type post,             dataType html,             timeout 30000,             data                  RowIndex otherRows.length,                 Item.Property1 optionselected, dropDown.text,                 Item.Property2 optionselected, dropDown.val             ,             success function result                  var newRow  result                 tableBody.appendnewRow                        codepre  pThis function makes an ajax call to go get an mvc action result that returns the result of a row at the given index and additionally sets some default values from a drop down on my page. p  pNow lets assume I have a similar function called delete in which using jquery i remove a row and at this point the table has 3 rows ignoring the header row of course, and the row im removing is the middle row.p  pthis means the fields in my rows end up looking something like this ...p  precodeRow 1 ltinput typetext nameSomeCollection[0].Property1 gt   Row 2    Nothing, deleted of course  Row 3  ltinput typetext nameSomeCollection[2].Property1 gt  codepre  pSo if i now do a postback, because of the inconsistent id range, the MVC model binder will only bind item 1 for me and item 2 actually item 3 prior to the client side delete is not mapped.p  pThe idea is that i want my server logic to do a very simple if the id for an item in my collection is not in the post data, delete it from the database, this way all the collection manipulation can be entirely client side in save on constant postbacks on this very heavy page.p  pSo I started putting a function together in jquery to fix the problem ...p  precodefunction updateNamestable      var rows  tr, table     var index  0      rows.eachfunction           var inputFields  input          inputFields.eachfunction            replace namebla[ltany numbergt].Anything with                    namebla[  index  ].Anything                           index       codepre  pSo my question is ... How do i say to jquery replace [] in the name attribute with [index]p  pI know this wont solve the problem of nested collections  other such complex scenarios but for that once i have this function solved I can always extend it later and my requirements are not that involved yet.p  pEDIT p  pSome additional detail on my current thought pattern ... good or badp  pif i grab the name attribute value and walk the chars until i find the first [ and the next ] then replace everything in between, it should solve my problem, but this type of thing on IE probably slow as hell. p  pAnyone got a neat just call this clever function type answer if there is one.p  pEDIT 2p  pWow I really gotta look harder ... what a dumbass i feel like right now for 2 reasons not looking and regex is an obvious solution herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11024971jqueryhowtoreplaceallbetweencertaincharactersJQuery how to replace all between certain charactersap  pif i can figure out the right regex ive got my solution maybe thats the question I should have asked as im constantly annoyed by the crazyness of regex.p  pBut the power of a regex cannot be under estimated p

Negative 4075 pI have often bemoaned the fact that the WPF ToggleButton does not have properties for AlternateContent and AlternateContentForeground.  Im curious if theres any advantage to creating a DependencyObject with attached properties, or deriving a custom control from ToggleButtonp  pMy assumption is that attached properties are advantageous if they are useable on more than one control.  So in my case Im leaning towards a derived control since those properties are unique to the togglebutton.p

Negative 4075 pIm trying to use OpenDyslexic as a font option in a Swing application. But surprisingly, OpenDyslexic looks much bigger than any other font at the same point size, even though it looks normally sized in other applications. Ive tried a handful of other OpenType fonts, and they dont look especially large or small. Why is OpenDyslexic so big in Java, and how can I get Java to size it normally so I dont have to specialcase the size of OpenDyslexicp  pOn Oracle JRE I tried 1.7.011, 1.7.015, and the latest 1.7.021 on all OSes, the font is too big when Java loads the font file using codeFont.createFontcode. However, when I stronginstallstrong the font into the operating system, the behavior is different on all 3 platformsp  ul liIn Linux, installing the font to code.fontscode does no good. The screenshot looks the same before installing the font and after installing it.li liIn Windows, installing the font fixes the font emglyphsem, but the font emspacingem is still too big See screenshot below.li liIn OS X, installing the font fixes it It looks like a normalsized font on OS X.li ul  pstrongUpdatestrong Interestingly, OpenJDK both the 7u21 Ubuntu package in Linux and the obuildfactory build on OS X does strongnotstrong exhibit the bug. The 15pt OpenDyslexic m is 15px wide on OpenJDK, as it should be, both when the font is created from file and when the font is handled by the operating system. The bug is in the latest Oracle JRE but not in the latest OpenJDK.p  pHeres my example program. Note that to try it, you need to put the a hrefhttpopendyslexic.org relnofollowOpenDyslexica files into resources.

Negative 4075 pI am wondering if I use correct method to call something in different thread. I am doing it on Android, but think it is generic Java question.p  pI have method with some parameters. Lets say they are int.p  precodeclass Main1    public static void mainOnlyWorkint x, int y        not important here.      class Test    Handler mHandler     called from main thread, stored as reference.   public Test      mHandler  new Handler       public static void callInMainThreadfinal int x, final int y      mHandler.postnew Runnable        public void run          Main1.mainOnlyWorkx, y                codepre  pNow my question is, is it safe to use final ints to create anonymous runnable without any class members If I omit final keywords for x and y parameters, Eclipse will complain. It seems to me, that is intended to use only constant numbers in such cases. If I pass not a constant, is it ok Does Java make it constant by passing to this functionp  pBut I want to call Test.callInMainThread from native using JNI. There is no way Java can tell if those numbers are constants or not in my opinion. Can I trust Java to make some magic Will it always work this wayp  pI think maybe I have to create proxy class, likep  precodeprivate abstract RunnableXY implements Runnable    public RunnableXYint x, int y      this.x  x     this.y  y       public int x   public int y    public abstract void run  codepre  pAnd call method would usep  precode  public static void callInMainThreadfinal int x, final int y      mHandler.postnew RunnableXYx,y        public void run          Main1.mainOnlyWorkthis.x, this.y                codepre  pThis way, i protect values against garbage collecting until runnable is used and dropped away. Do I have to create wrappers, or is marking final x in method parameters safe When I try it, final keyword works just fine. However in threads, I do not think if it works now is reason it will work always as well. Does it work always with final How is it made if it does Would there be difference if parameter is not primitive type, but Objectp  pUpdate I already understand what final means in Java. That is not point of question. Point of question is where is scope of variables used in creation of Runnable. They are locals, that means after end of function their value cannot be referenced. Where are that values stored then, when Runnable object is passed to other thread and waits to be executedp

Negative 4075 pOne of the things that really draws me to TDD is the clear development of your spec alongside implementation. p  pI am seeking to implement a constructor that accepts a configuration objectp  precodefunction MyConstructorconf  codepre  pcodeconfcode is currently specd to have two keys codeacode and codebcode, where codeacode is a codeRegExpcode and codebcode is a codeFunctioncode, and as part of my TDD spec elucidation ambitions, I am writing tests that spec out this object as such p  ul liI would like codeMyConstructorcode to throw an codeErrorcode if either codeacode is not a codeRegExpcode or codebcode is not a codeFunctioncode. li licodeMyConstructorcode throws an codeErrorcode if either codeacode or codebcode is missing from the configuration. li ul  pNow, I know that I could encapsulate this behavior in some other constructor, say a codeConfigurationcode constructor that creates configuration objects. But the way I am seeing this now, regardless of where this behavior ends up, this behavior has to be encapsulated emsomewhereem for this spec to be elaborated via TDD.p  pThe problem is I seems to me that as the number of keys on the codeconfcode object grows, so does the number of testsexponentially This is especially due to the second bullet above. p  pFor example, say I have 4 keys codeacode, codebcode, codeccode and codedcode, and I need to make sure that if any are missing an Error is thrown. emIt seemsem that this requires that I write a ton of identical, banal tests that cover all the possibilities strongcombinationsstrong for missing keys. That doesnt sound right Yet, I cant think of a good way explicitly or inductively test that all scenarios are covered. Any thoughtsp

Then, check for anything from the GUI, send it over the network, and so on.p  pThe problem is, that I can receive messages just fine been testing with Telnet up until this point..., and the message gets to the GUI thread fine. printf will display it just fine however it feels dirty mixing printf and nCurses, but printw will just present me with a newline for my trouble.

Negative 4075 pI am wondering why the following SEQUEL calculations do not work properly and they seem to be based more on content than on syntax. This all started when one of our Viewpoint Help Systems sequel queries failed to calculate properly on one row of data not all rows for one column. I copied the code from the Sequel Viewpoint application  and paste directly into a codeSTRSQLcode on the iseries and experienced the same results. You will see below calculations using the value 922.459  one resulting in codecode, one resulting in correct value without parenthesis and one with correct calculation but calculations slimmed down. You also see value of 50  where the result is zero and one using 50.5 showing correct result. I am getting data decimal errors but of course nothing to help me understand why  especially since I am working with all hardcoded numbers. One thing I did find  if I change the number from 50 to 50.0  the calculation is correct.  However if I do the same for number 922  both 922 and 922.0 result in the codecode. Any ideasp  precodeSELECT  Bprod,1.111922.459110001.06  FROM    BOMBYITEM                                     codepre  pyieldsp  precodeItem                                               Numeric Expression    Number                                                                   124927                                  codepre  pwhilep  precodeSELECT   bprod,1.111  922.45911000 1.06  FROM     BOMBYITEM                               codepre  pyieldsp  precodeItem                                                 Numeric Expression    Number                                                                     124927                                       1.075587194000000000000000    codepre  pandp  precodeSELECT  bprod,1.1.922459 1.06    FROM    BOMBYITEM                        codepre  pyieldsp  precodeItem                                 Numeric Expression  Number                                                   124927                                   1.075587194     codepre  pandp  precodeSELECT  Bprod,1.11150110001.06    FROM    BOMBYITEM                                  codepre  pyieldsp  precodeItem                                                  Numeric Expression  Number                                                                    124927                                            .000000000000000000000 codepre  pandp  precodeSELECT  Bprod,1.11150.5110001.06  FROM    BOMBYITEM                                  codepre  pyieldsp  precodeItem                                               Numeric Expression     Number                                                                    124927                               .0588830000000000000000000000000 codepre

Negative 4075 pI just started learning functional programming and I find myself very confused by the concept of pattern matching im using SML.

Here is another example that doesnt use the as keyword.p  precodereturns a list with the sum of each element added of two lists added together  fun addLists nil,L  L  addLists L,nil  L  addLists xxs,yys    x  yaddListsxs,ys codepre  pThank you for your helpp
Negative 4075 pI think there is no solution for problem were facing, but for confirmation I would like to you ask here.p  pWe have REST API that is consumed fromp  ul liadministration website AngularJS  li licustomer website AngularJSli liother REST API clients own API applicationsli ul  pBecause requests from administrationcustomer website are made by AngularJS at a client side, users are able to determine e.g. via FireBug resources URLs and are able to consume all these resources from their own applications  what we dont want to and we cannot to restrict it e.g. with IP address because requests go from client. We would like to offer some group of resources only for customer  administration website and some resources for own REST API clients and some resources for both, but from the principle of JS requests made from AngularJS and resource URL visibility it cannot be done. p  pWhat could be the best practice for this issuep
Negative 4075 pwe have a strange performance problem with ObjectDB 2.5.301 and JBoss 7.1.1. We have two ObjectDB databases on one ObjectDB server. Production database is running 510 times slower than test database. Their size and number of records are almost identical. When running production database in separate test environment its speed is very good. We did a performance analysis on our 2 linux servers one running JBOSS and other running ObjectDB.  CPU utilization of JBOSS server is max 510 per core  CPU utilization of JBOSS server is 80150 this is per corep  pNow is the interesting part, when running a query from ObjectDB explorer CPU utilization is minimal ie. 1 Running a query from ObjectDB explorer on complete database which has 12000 records takes 30ms which we think is very good. In our web application this behaviour gives aprox 1013 s of refreshing a data table vs 2 second with test database. p  pDoes anybody have any idea what could be wrong.p

Negative 4075 pI recently submitted my iOS app to Apple for review. It was written in C using Xamarin iOS, Monotouch and Monogame. I used the Xamarin IDE for development. A week later I get a rejection which specifies the reason being that the app crashes on iPad when the reviewer tries to access the InAppPurchase store, while on the iPhone 5s it doesnt crash, but indicates that it couldnt reach the Apple servers to retrieve the store items. Much of my store retrieving code is from Xamarins guide found a hrefhttpdocs.xamarin.comguidesiosapplicationfundamentalsinapppurchasingpart2storekitoverviewandretreivingproductinformation relnofollowherea. p  pThe problem is that I could not replicate those crashes. The store opens just fine with me and I tested it extensively. I tested on all simulators, and many real devices in debug amp release configurations iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPad 3rd generation. I didnt test in adhoc mode since many of these devices were borrowed from my friends and I didnt want to sync in iTunes since that could wipe out device data. So am hoping release build and adhoc are equivalent in terms of finding the review teams bug. p  pAs for the crash logs given to me by Apple, they didnt help me since most lines dont get symbolicated properly in Xcode using the same archive that I submitted to Apple. There are a lot of lldbunnamedfunction lines in the log. All i was able to tell was that the crash occurred when trying to retrieve the store. Therefore am stuck and not  sure what to do next. Advice is appreciated.p  pBelow is the last portion of a long crash log.p  precodeIncident Identifier 24777CEA21FF434BA658BFB4BC89F7B2 CrashReporter Key   e981dd69858f1d35ba231cd2e288f3d33625919f Hardware Model      xxx Version             1 1 Code Type           ARM Native Parent Process      launchd [1] DateTime           20140109 133021.579 0800 OS Version          iOS 7.0.4 11B554a Report Version      104  Exception Type  EXCCRASH SIGABRT Exception Codes 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000 Triggered by Thread  0  Thread 0 name  Dispatch queue com.apple.mainthread Thread 0 Crashed 0   libsystemkernel.dylib          0x387e41fc pthreadkill  8 1   libsystempthread.dylib         0x3884ba4f pthreadkill  55 2   libsystemc.dylib               0x38795029 abort  73 3   MyGame                          0x00d8036d monohandlenativesigsegv miniexceptions.c2413 4   MyBeGame                        0x00d855b7 sigabrtsignalhandler miniposix.c206 5   libsystemplatform.dylib        0x38846721 sigtramp  41 6   libsystempthread.dylib         0x3884ba4f pthreadkill  55 7   libsystemc.dylib               0x38795029 abort  73 8   MyBeGame                        0x00e30744 monotouchunhandledexceptionhandler monotouchglue.m1436 9   MyBeGame                        0x00d8072d monoinvokeunhandledexceptionhook miniexceptions.c2749 10  MyBeGame                        0x00d8d7ab monothreadabortdummy mini.c2768 11  MyBeGame                        0x00d7ff35 monohandleexceptioninternal miniexceptions.c1710 12  MyBeGame                        0x00d7f6b7 monohandleexception miniexceptions.c2003 13  MyBeGame                        0x00d791b5 monoarmthrowexception exceptionsarm.c161 14  MyBeGame                        0x0023f7d4 lldbunnamedfunction12968MyBeGame  64 15  MyBeGame                        0x002da1d0 lldbunnamedfunction20307MyBeGame  92 16  MyBeGame                        0x00293960 lldbunnamedfunction17583MyBeGame  196 17  MyBeGame                        0x00212418 lldbunnamedfunction12101MyBeGame  168 18  MyBeGame                        0x0029205c lldbunnamedfunction17574MyBeGame  92 19  MyBeGame                        0x00295c58 lldbunnamedfunction17610MyBeGame  32 20  MyBeGame                        0x00083570 lldbunnamedfunction2892MyBeGame  860 21  MyBeGame                        0x000954f4 lldbunnamedfunction3194MyBeGame  1516 22  MyBeGame                        0x00093610 lldbunnamedfunction3176MyBeGame  40 23  MyBeGame                        0x0006246c MyBeGame.HintStoreController.HintStoreControlStateRetrievingltActivategtmF  624 24  MyBeGame                        0x0045d39c lldbunnamedfunction33945MyBeGame  48 25  MyBeGame                        0x0020c10c lldbunnamedfunction11957MyBeGame  196 26  MyBeGame                        0x00d8ce4f monojitruntimeinvoke mini.c6504 27  MyBeGame                        0x00dd482b monoruntimeinvoke object.c2827 28  MyBeGame                        0x00d5117b nativetomanagedtrampolineMonoTouchFoundationInternalNSNotificationHandlerPost registrar.m28 29  CoreFoundation                  0x2da4fe6f CFNOTIFICATIONCENTERISCALLINGOUTTOANOBSERVER  11 30  CoreFoundation                  0x2d9c3aad CFXNotificationPost  1717 31  Foundation                      0x2e3a9ec1 [NSNotificationCenter postNotificationNameobjectuserInfo]  69 codepre

Negative 4075 pI am not very familiar with C , and while I am trying some test programms I came to a question regarding the embestem if I may say so way to define some primitive elements in C code.p  pLets take a class that describes rectangles. It would create them, draw them , rotate, resize, etc... now in most cases we have to deal with points on the canvas.  The rectangle its self is described by 2 points Upper Left and Lower Right corner. Also in order to Rotate it, you need an angle, and a pointanchor point. Or maybe to move it you need a new anchor point for the given rectangle. I guess I made my empoint in using pointsem . So what is more efficient  to define this primitive strongpointstrong as a class or as a structp  precodeclass cPoint  public   int X  int Y  codepre  pemoremp  precodetypedef struct   int X  int Y sPoint codepre

Negative 4075 pAlmost every time I write an app for a client I have to implement some kind of hack to get codeUITableViewCellcodes to dynamically become the right height. Depending on the content of the cells this can vary in difficulty.  p  pI usually end up running through code that formats the cell twice, once in  codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode and then again in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode. I then use an array or dictionary to store either the height or the formatted cell object. p  pIve probably written and rewritten this code 20 times over the past 2 years. Why did Apple implement it in this order It would be much more straightforward to configure the cells and THEN set the height either in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode or shortly thereafter in codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode.p  pIs there a good reason for the existing order Is there a better way to handle itp

Negative 4075 pI am trying to create a card layout in my app very much like the multitasking UI in iOS 7. The engineering WWDC video Exploring Scroll Views on iOS 7, notes that they used nested scroll views to accomplish that effect in iOS 7, but did not go into any detail. I would imagine that they would have used a UICollectionView, since that seemed like the most intuitive way.p  pSo far I have tried making a custom UICollectionViewFlowLayout, but it is quite difficult and doesnt provide the functionality I am looking for. I have also tried using a UICollectionView with a UICollectionViewFlowLayout wherein each of the custom UICollectionViewCells cells has a scrollview which has a card as its subview.

Negative 4075 pHey I have a problem were I have to solve xn in a number of ways. One of them involves using a recursion formula and its giving me a hard time. So one of the ways I used recursion for xn for n0p  precodeint power2int base, int power     if power  0         return 1     else if  power  1         return base     else          return base  power2base, power  1  codepre  pthis makes sense to me So when i set X  2 and N  4, it is decreasing the power, which is acting as a counter, and doing 2x2 power raised to 3, 42, power raised to 2, 8 2  16. Than the power is raised to 1, and I have a base case were if the power is raised to 1 it just returns base. However for my next one I have to solve it using three formulas.p  ul lixsup0sup  1li lixsupnsup if n is even  [xsupn2sup]sup2supli lixsupnsup if n is odd  x  [xsupn2sup]sup2supli ul  pSo what I have so far isp  precodeint power3int base, int power     ifpower  0         return 1          else if  power  1         return base      if power is even     if power  2  0         return basepower3base,power2           if power is odd     else         return 0       codepre  pSo im just trying to get even numbers to work first, and when I set x2 and n4 it returns 8. Which makes sense to me, since when the power is 42 will only loop twice for being 1. So i really am trying to figure out a way to get this to loop one more time while staying true to the formula I was given.and when I added the odd base case now the program will work up untill n5 but n6 returns 32 p

Negative 4075 pI have an apache proxy for a meteor app and apache and meteor are on two separate machines. I need it that way as apache has to serve a lot of real websites and it wouldnt be a good idea to install the meteor app on this machine due to its limited resources.p  pHowever the WebSocket handshake fails with response code 400 Can upgrade only to websocket if I try to connect from the outside via the proxy. Everything works fine when I connect from within the LAN directly to the meteor machine. When WebSocket fails SockJSMeteor falls back to XHR but unfortunately this brings up some bugs in the app in question. So I really need WebSocket to work in most of the cases.p  pI patched my apache installation with the patch mentioned here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16998664httpstackoverflow.coma16998664a That looked like it went well but nothing changed...p  pMy apache proxy directives currently are as followsp  precodeProxyRequests Off ProxyPreserveHost On ModPagespeed Off ltproxygt Order deny,allow Allow from all ltproxygt ProxyPass  http10.0.2.63000 ProxyPassReverse  http10.0.2.63000 codepre  pAnd I even know whats triggering the problem. The apache proxy messes around with the header. The original request header of the packet in question leaving my machine looks like thisp  precodeGET sockjs430minw4rowebsocket HTTP1.1 Upgrade websocket Connection Upgrade Host example.com Origin httpexample.com Pragma nocache CacheControl nocache SecWebSocketKey myKey SecWebSocketVersion 13 SecWebSocketExtensions permessagedeflate clientmaxwindowbits, xwebkitdeflateframe UserAgent My Agent codepre  pWhile the packet gets forwarded from the apache proxy like thisp  precodeGET sockjs430minw4rowebsocket HTTP1.1 Host example.com Origin httpexample.com Pragma nocache CacheControl nocache SecWebSocketKey myKey SecWebSocketVersion 13 SecWebSocketExtensions permessagedeflate clientmaxwindowbits, xwebkitdeflateframe UserAgent My Agent XForwardedFor 24.xxx.xxx.xxx XForwardedHost example.com XForwardedServer example.com Connection KeepAlive codepre  pSo Upgrade gets removed and Connection altered and so the websocket handshake fails. Now I could try to always set Upgrade to websocket with a RequestHeader directive. However this doesnt feel right and I guess it would bring up other problems and so I was wondering if there is a real solution to this problem Or is this something the patch from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16998664httpstackoverflow.coma16998664a should address and something went wrong on my end applying itp  pFrom what I have read switching to nginx could make this setup easier. I will consider this but when possible Id like to do this with apache as nginx would make other things more complicated and cost me a lot of time.p

In other words, this query yields no rowsp  precodeSELECT  FROM    SELECT     LEADCOL1, 1 OVER ORDER BY COL1 NEXT,     COL2   FROM A  WHERE COL2 gt NEXT codepre  pThere is currently an index on codeCOL1, COL2code. Now, my query is the followingp  precodeSELECT FIRSTROWS1  FROM A WHERE somevalue BETWEEN COL1 AND COL2 AND ROWNUM  1 codepre  pThis performs well less than a ms for millions of records in codeAcode for low values of codesomevaluecode, because theyre very selective on the index. But it performs quite badly almost a second for high values of codesomevaluecode because of a lower selectivity of the access predicate.p  pThe execution plan seems good to me.

Negative 4075 pI am currently writing my first Wordpress plugin. Since I am pretty sure this will not be my last one I try to put as much code as possible into common code files for later reuse in other plugins.p  pI am using namespaces and OOP programming to allow the code beeing reused like I do in my C projects as far as PHP allows to do so.p  pHowever in WPPHP there is a problem with no obvious solution Where should I place the shared code files Wordpress kind of merges all the code in a global application. So copying code into each plugin folder could mean potential collisions andor random use of code files with same content but different stages of development. Also this would create ugly redundancies.p  pI did not find a dedicated central storage place.p  pPlacing the shared code in the plugins folder is a bad idea since each shared code file would be considered a separate plugin.p  pI could add all the shared code by means of a special library plugin afaik this would make the contained code visible to all other plugins but this seem kind of weird. Also I am not sure if this would be reliable .p  pWhat is the best solutionp

Negative 4075 pI am currently learning HtmlUnit in order to scrape websites. Everything went well and smooth until I encountered a dynamic page as an example, I am using Pinterest website on which elements are added on the fly when the user scrolls down.p  pI have tried several ways that should trigger the scrolling in a real browser I will show them below. Before going further, I would like to mention that I have the following configuration already setp  precode    webclient.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue     webclient.setAjaxControllernew NicelyResynchronizingAjaxController codepre  pLets say I want to get all my followers on Pinterest. I navigate until that page and now since the first time you only have 24 of them, I want to scroll down, event that triggers the Ajax call to the server and retrieves the next set of followers.p  p1 Plain javascript or jQuery code to trigger scroll on window.p  precode    ScriptResult sr  followersPage.executeJavaScriptwindow.scrollBy0,1000      One version in jQuery      ScriptResult sr  followersPage.executeJavaScriptwindow.scrollTop0,1000      also tried with the body, html, with animation      ScriptResult sr  followersPage.executeJavaScripthtml, body.animate scrollTop document.height , 1000     webclient.waitForBackgroundJavaScript10000     followersPage  HtmlPagesr.getNewPage codepre  p When I check the distance to top, it is equal to 0 and the result page is the same as the original page. While debugging in Eclipse, when I step over the line where javascript is executed, it directly goes to the next line without any delay. If I write any other javascript, like for examplep  precode     ScriptResult sr  followersPage.executeJavaScriptdiv.GridItems.htmlnew content codepre  pyou can notice that the debugger hangs half a second on that line, meaning that the javascript is executed.p  p2 Change the focus from one follower anchor to the other I chose the anchor because it is used in the focus order when you click on TAB keyp  precode    HtmlDivision gridItems  followersPage.getFirstByXPathdiv[containsconcat ,class, , GridItems ]     ListltHtmlDivisiongt els  ListltHtmlDivisiongt gridItems.getByXPathdiv[classitem ]     ListltHtmlDivisiongt items  ListltHtmlDivisiongt gridItems.getByXPathdiv[classitem ]     for HtmlDivision item  items          HtmlAnchor a  item.getFirstByXPatha[classuserWrapper]         a.focus         webClient.waitForBackgroundJavaScript1000          followersPage  HtmlPage webClient.getCurrentWindow.getEnclosedPage codepre  pAgain, no scrolling occurred.

And it seems that nobody managed to make scroll work using HtmlUnit since most of the questions remained unanswered.

Negative 4075 pWe are using WebLogic Server 10.3.4 with a setup of a cluster of 3 managed servers and a coherence cache. Recently, we got some timeout exception when the app tries to updateadd or edit the cache. The frequency is about a few times every hour and it just happens to some of the requests only, not all of them as most of time the apps can still update the cache.p  pWe have set the high limit and policy with unit calculator inside the coherence xml file. We tried to monitor the memory usage as we are worried it may be the GC but it is not likely. Heap size is set to 2GB on each managed server and the exception comes when the cache is far from fully filled.

Negative 4075 pOur company is currently using RAD to develop our Java apps, but were looking to move to Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools. The pilot for our transition is going pretty well, except were running into a classloader policy issue for new applications that are originally created in Eclipse, not RAD. Our projects that were originally created by RAD are deployed with the correct classloader policy PARENTLAST when published via Eclipse because we originally used the Deployment Descriptor Editor in RAD which set the proper classloader policy in codesrcmainapplicationMETAINFibmconfigcellsdefaultCellapplicationsdefaultAppdeploymentsdefaultAppdeployment.xmlcode. But now with Eclipse amp WebSphere Developer Tools, we no longer have the nice Deployment Descriptor Editor UI to create or modify this file for us apparently a hrefhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkscommunityforumshtmltopicid72758e1c88684b5e9c99f539882db6ca relnofollowits not included with the WDT plugina.p  pSo, my question then is what is the best way to go about setting this classloader policy We still need some new apps to have the classloader policy of PARENTLAST set when we deploy them to our local servers. Our team has though about this a bit and we can see 4 options at the moment.p  ol liOpen the Admin Console after every publish and change it. This would be a huge pain, and is pretty much not even a real option.li liChange the server profile setting to use a PARENTLAST classloader policy for all apps. This however is not the case for all the apps at our company, and would not work for all groups.li liRun a jython script after every publish to set the classloader policy. This is slightly better than option 1, but not by much.li liManually create a deployment.xml file in the same location as the other apps created by RAD with the same structure as the deployment.xml files created by RAD, and modify it as necessary for each app.li ol  pOption 4 seems to be the best of the bunch, but its still a manual process and somewhat error prone. Even if most of our developers can grok this approach for new apps, it would be most ideal if this were a simple one button click type process.p  pSo given the fact that IBM has omitted the Deployment Descriptor Editor from the WDT plugin it would seem as if option 4 is our only hope, but Ill ask once more, is there any other better way to set a WebSphere classloader policy to PARENTLAST for an app when that app is created in Eclipse Any help is appreciated, thanks.p

All I want is to fill the Array with new Arrays and push some data to them. The following code should check if coderesults[x][y]code already is an Array and create one if its not and push data to it.p  pSo, in the end, there should be an Array result that contains X.length Arrays filled with an unknown number of new Arrays, each of them containing an unknown number of datap  precode    function pushResultresult           if typeof results[currentStim][currentDist]  undefined              results[currentStim][currentDist]  new Array                      results[currentStim][currentDist].pushresult         codepre  pProblem is It just doesnt work. I made sure that codecurrentStimcode is never out of bounds, I made sure that the ifStatement is only accessed when needed so the Array isnt overwritten with a new one and I watched the returnvalue of codepushcode, always throwring back a number representing the new array length. As expected, this number increases evertime a value is pushed to an Array.p  pHowever, when I finally callp  precodedocument.getElementByIdresults.value   JSON.stringifyresults codepre  pto pass coderesultscode to my PHPscript, something like this will be passedp  precode [[],[[1]],[],[]] codepre  pcodepushcodewas called MUCH more often than once at least 1 is one of the results I wanted to be stored and, as described, always returned an increasing arrayLength. How does that work What happened to my datap  pI testet this on Chrome as well as on Firefox, same result. It might be interesting that a seperate loop draws to a Canvas the same time, but that shouldnt interupt ArrayHandling and onKeyEvents, rightp  pHope u can help me,p  pMA3op  pEDIT p  ppushResult is called like thisp  precode     Handles SpaceEvents          function pushedevent          if event.which  32 ampamp stimAlive              pushResult1             hitCurrent  true          codepre  pWhere hitCurrent and stimAlive are just flags set somewhere else. Some code further the function codepushedcodeis registered as an event listener p  precode document.onkeydown  functionevent  pushedevent codepre  pAll the functions are called correctly.

I have already got to the stage where I can produce the button and make it look as I wish it to, and in the right position, but am struggling to get the href parameter to work with any page identifying Javascript I have already found.  Here is what I have so farp  precodea.wikiabutton.talk.afterltdivgtlta classwikiabutton titleGo to normal delete page hrefgtDeleteltagtltdivgt codepre  pThe three question marks are where I dont know what to put.  One obvious problem I have found in trying to get this to work is to do with quotes single and double quotes have both already been used, and so cant be used again within the href parameter at least, not in any way I know of.  This obviously makes it hard to identify a string to add the actiondelete to the end of the URL, and Im guessing is the main problem causing my function to break in all the ways Ive previously tried.p  pAny help you could give would be most appreciated  I would also like to point out that Im not that good with Javascript, and usually just stick to altering others functions.  However, I havent so far found any other person with this specific Javascript nestling problem to steal their code, so I hope you can help outp  pImamadmadp

Negative 4075 pNow theres the new a hrefhttpazure.microsoft.comblog20140514regionalvirtualnetworks relnofollowAzure Regional Virtual Networks featurea that spans a region, is there a performance benefit of using affinity groups In the FAQ part of the linked blog post there readsp  blockquote   pstrongDo I incur any performance degradation for services running inside a Regional Virtual Networkstrongp      pVirtual network is only a logical boundary, it does not dictate where   the deployments in the VNet actually go to. If for some reason, you   need services to be in the same Affinity group, you can still do that   inside a regional virtual network. During deployment you will have to   specify the Affinity group to which the hosted service should be bound   to. The only restriction would be, that the Affinity groups should   belong to the same region as the Regional Virtual network.p      pIf you do not bind your hosted service to an Affinity group, and   deploy services directly to the Regional Virtual Network, your   deployments will be placed in a scale unit inside the region the   Virtual Network is bound to.p blockquote  pI get a feeling the recommendation is not to use affinity groups at all anymore based on this and some other posts, maybe its my Azure andor English comprehension, though, but would the services and data be colocated in the data center thenp  pltedit Of course just after writing this I discovered a MSDN article a hrefhttpsazure.microsoft.comenusdocumentationarticlesvirtualnetworksmigratetoregionalvnet relnofollowAbout Regional VNets and Affinity Groups for Virtual Networka which states p  blockquote   pPreviously, when creating a virtual network VNet you were required   to associate the VNet with an affinity group, which was in turn,   associated with a Region. This requirement has changed. Now VNets are   associated directly with a Region Location in the Management Portal.   This allows you more freedom when creating your VNets. You can still   associate your cloud services with affinity groups when appropriate,   but you are not required to do so.p      pThe emRegionem represents where the Virtual Network overlay will be.   Anything you deploy to the virtual network will be physically located   in the Region. If you want to further designate that you want your   resources in close proximity physically to each other within the same   region, you can specify an affinity group for those particular   resources. That would mean that not only are those resources in the   same physical location, they are very close to each other in the   datacenter.p blockquote  pSo, I suppose there is a performance benefit to be had when using affinity groups.p  pstronglteditstrong The most definitive source for the little performance edge and use cases for affinity groups I can find is to be found at a hrefhttpconvective.wordpress.com20140711affinitygroupsinazure relnofollowConvective blog post Affinity Groups in Azurea.p  blockquote   pAn affinity group serves two purposesp      ol   licolocation of cloud service and storage account li   lihost for an affinity group VNETli   ol      pThe second of these is now deprecated. The first is still possible but   has not been emphasized as the latency optimization it was prior to   the upgrade of the Azure network in 2012. In fact the standard way to   deploy a VM in the Azure Portal does not support the simultaneous   creation of a cloud service in an affinity group and a regional VNET.   This confuses people who try to satisfy the modern best practice of   using a regional VNET for deployments and the historic best practice   of creating a cloud service in an affinity group.p      pAt this point there seems to be little reason to deploy a cloud   service into an affinity group. However, as with other deployment   choices it might be wise for people to test this out for their   specific workloads.p blockquote

I thought it might interest some of you as to WHY I am going through the hassle of doing this programmatically rather than through the XML file.  The reason is that I am trying to recognize a large number of gestures rapidly.  I found with another test file that having a single GestureOverlayView was slow, you would recognize them one at a time.  However, side by side, they would be able to create predictions simultaneously, giving the illusion of faster.  With a bit of work, I am hoping to create additional GestureOverlayViews on touch, and destroy them once the command is complete.  But I couldnt even get through the obvious in this simple test, which is the creation of the view.p

Negative 4075 pUp until now, Ive generally loaded localized content by using a language code that gets sent from the browser to the server. It could be derived from the browsers language setting or selected by the user from some language selection. This could be something like enus stored in a cookie or possibly a header.

In Javascript, I might detect the language setting when the page initially loads and then inject language dependent content into variables or directly into HTML markup.p  pThis is the approach Ive been doing for years but Im not sure whether this is the proper approach, especially now that I have started building my apps with AngularJS.

Negative 4075 pIm a little new to Angular, so Im not really sure what the standards are when it comes to writing an app that has something like this.p  pI had some functions and content I needed to share across controllers, so I isolated them out into a factory so the controllers could act independently of each other. p  pBut then I realized most, if not all of the logic and content for those few controllers were part of what needed to be shared. Now the controllers I initially created to handle the logic prior to realizing I would need to isolate their information are empty.p  pSome of the functions I moved over simply involve saving passedin values into different variables that emcouldem be controller specific and wouldnt impact dependency injection, but since they deal with a lot of information in the factory, I thought it would be easier to simply keep them there rather than move some small functions and variables back to the controller. So now I have two empty controllers that I might as well delete.p  pMy question In a situation like this where you need to share information that would otherwise be isolated into its own controllers, is it better to simply have a factory that talks minimally to some controllers just to share data, but holds all of the logic and data itself inside the factory Or would it be better to designate controllers to hold small pieces of the specific logic, despite it taking most of its data from the factory anyways.p  pIs it better to use controllers to back up my factory, even if the question at hand doesnt call for themp

Negative 4075 pI am setting up a new server infrastructure and plan to have multiple appservers running django. One thing I am wondering about is how to handle the Locale folder. p  pAs it is now, I use djangorosetta which is an awesome app btw to handle the translations on the production server. That works fine because I have only one appserver running. When I migrate to a setup with multiple servers Id like to avoid having to enter every server instance and make the same changes. p  pI do not have my language files checked into the repo and like to keep it that way. Not a fan of merging those at all... p  pIdeas that crossed my mind is having a script that transfers the translated folder to the other instances once the changes are made on server1.

Negative 4075 pIts the first time that I have had to set up a MediaWiki site and I am relatively new to it as a whole. p  pMy problem is that users can upload files only images in my case without selecting one of the licenses in the drop down box on the Specialupload page, I have defined licenses though under MediaWikiLicenses so there are licenses selectable. I would like the upload warning function to tell users that a license is required to upload a file the same way you are warned the name is to short or whatever. The user must first pick a license before being able to continue. p  pI have searched around quite a bit and it doesnt seem as easy a changing a variable somewhere. If the solution is something that I should have known I apologize for posting a stupid question...p

Negative 4075 pIm using VS 2008 at the moment for my development ASP.NET C.p  pCurrently Im facing some problem with GridViewp  pI bind data to the GridView DataSource using a DataSet query from database, I then have a checkbox which allow user to hide or display the column using the following method p  precode    if chkPhone.Checked  true  strSQL  , recruitwebsite as Website  codepre  pOkay now the problem I facing is that, how do I make this specific column rows to wrap with anchor tag So that user can go to the respective website directly though the GridView.p  pSo the first approach I use was to use the RowDataBound event and do something like p  precode    e.Row.Cells[7].Text  lta href  e.Row.Cells[7].Text  gtClick Meltagt codepre  pBut then the problem comes, IF the user choose not to display this column, the column index will be different.

Negative 4075 pIm working on the codeiOScode part of a codeXamarincode project and am using the codeXCodecode interface designer for the codeUIcode. For the codedatabindingcode of the codeinterfacecode elements we are using codeMvvmCrosscode and now Im facing the following issue p  pIm binding the textlabel of an codeUITextViewcode and a codeUIButtoncode and that works fine. However, the codefontcode Ive setup for these elements in the interface designer is reset if I apply the binding. Both codefonttypecode and codefontcolorcode are reset to the default font and color. If I remove the binding, then I see font and color on the mobile device as configured in the designer. Im using the following lines to setup the bindingp  precodethis.CreateBindingthis.theText.ForText     .TotheViewModel vm gt vm.TextSource     .WithConversionnew MvxLanguageConverter, theText     .Apply  this.CreateBindingthis.theButton     .TotheViewModel vm gt vm.theButtonCommand     .Apply  this.CreateBindingthis.theButton.ForTitle     .TotheViewModel vm gt vm.TextSource     .WithConversionnew MvxLanguageConverter, theButton     .Apply codepre  pIs there a way to set this up so that codefontcode and codecolorcode are preserved If not I can setup these elements in code, but I prefer to do the design in the designer as much as possible.p  pThanks Olafp  pPS. see comments, this is apparently not related to databinding using MvvmCross. However, the proposed solutions in the other post basically suggest to make a new attributed string using the existing attributes and I dont see how you would do this using binding.p

Negative 4075 pI am a relative novice with Access and starting from scratch with coding, so be gentle.p  pI have an Access 2010 database with dozens of linked tables based on .txt files. Sometimes the database moves, the source files move or the file server just gets renamed. In these events I am looking for a simple way for a user of the database to remap and refresh the linked tables. Ideally, it would be user prompted, i.e. the user pushes a button to refresh from a navigation form or something. Then, the system prompts for the new folder location. The folder location would house all of the necessary files, so it only needs to be selected one time. Once selected, all linked tables should remap and refresh with the user getting an error or success message.p  pI have seen a lot of these questions asked, but they seem to be in older versions of Access or it is not asking for a user prompt or for a user to browse for the new path.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4075 pI have a requirement for Mobile App development for both Android and IOS. Android development has done smoothly with Native Code. But for IOS development we dont have a Mac Machine to use. Only option the client has provided is a Mac Mini which shall be shared remotely . We have Windows machines to access the Mac remotely. p  pAfter searching through the net found some alternatives like macincloud , xcodeclub etc. but not needed as the client is already allowing us to access their mac machine. p  pWould like to know whether it hampers the development in any ways such as emulator, testing, or even use of Titanium or similar tools if required. Some of the advises were mainly pointing out the slowness of this approach as well as the Connecting windows machine configurations should match to specific mini mac config.

Negative 4075 pI am in the process of developing an application that will run on Azure and requires a user to upload very large .tiff files.  We are going to use blob storage to store the files.  I have been reviewing several websites to determine the correct approach to handling this situation and this link provides a good example but if I am using angular js on the frontend to grab and chunk them to the sas locator and upload via javascript, a hrefhttpazure.microsoft.comenusdocumentationarticlesstoragedotnetsharedaccesssignaturepart2 relnofollowhttpazure.microsoft.comenusdocumentationarticlesstoragedotnetsharedaccesssignaturepart2a.  My main confusion centers around the expiration time I should give to SAS for the user to perform the upload.  I would like a distinct SAS to be created each time a user performs a file upload and for it to go away once the file is uploaded.  I also would like to allow other site users to view the files as well.  What is the best approach for handling these two scenarios  Also, there are examples on how to generate SAS Locator for the container and for the blob, if I need tp add a new blob to a container, which makes more sensep

Negative 4075 pThe syntax obj.call is used for a call to a nonstatic method in Java, where obj is a reference to a Java object, and call is a method call. Explain how Javas type system limits what call may be for any value of obj.p  pI saw this in a text book and the answer they give does not really explain well, could someone explain it to me pleasep  pstrongEditstrong  The answer, which i do not understandp  pA reference to a Java object may be a variable, or it may be a method call. In either case, it has a type if it is a variable it has the declared type of the variable, if it is a method call its type is the declared return type of that variable. The type may be a class type or an interface type. Javas type system limits what the method call on obj may be to methods which are given in the type of obj. So call must be of the same name as a method in the type of obj, must have the same number of arguments as there are method parameters, and each argument must be compatible with its matching parameter. Compatible means of the same type or a subtype. If this requirement is not met, there will be a compiler error.p

Negative 4075 pIve been developing automated tests in Protractor for quite some time and like many of you, Ive run into gaps which can only be crossed with the codebrowser.sleepcodebridge. Im not a fan of hard coding things such as this but if its a necessity I will. p  pThe tests Ive developed have brought me to a point where every codebrowser.sleep1000code has a major impact on my runtime. The tests are currently testing permissions for different accounts 128 exactly and this involves logging in and out whilst checking what every account has and has not received access to.p  pThe website Im testing is a pure AngularJS application which, in my eyes, should make codebrowser.sleepcode a deprecated method since there is a codebrowser.waitForAngularcode method that accurately waits until the page is fully loaded compared to codebrowser.sleepcode which waits a set amount of time and if your website isnt loaded within that time it happens, youll have an inconsistent test nobody likes inconsistency.p  pResearch has led me to believe that codebrowser.waitForAngularcode does not take into account animations and related timeconsuming features since theyre not AngularJS related yet this is not implemented in our website. Also codewaitForAngularcode basically waits for codedigestcode, codehttpcode, and codetimeoutcode.p  pWhat Im asking is wether this is something which is regarded as an acceptable loss since Protractor is great in general or is there something Im overlooking herep  pTLDR  Are there solutions out there to allow us not to settle for codebrowser.sleepcodep  pSources a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorblobmasterdocstimeouts.mdtimeouts relnofollowProtractor Timeout Docsa, a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorblob3d60689b423749686973227f4b26cbb494f60b66debuggingtimeoutspec.js relnofollowTimeoutspec.js protractor docsa, a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorissues909 relnofollowIssue909a, a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorissues279 relnofollowIssue279a, a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorissues92 relnofollowIssue92a, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27240744whymustiusebrowsersleepwhilewritingprotractortestsStackQuestion1ap

Negative 4075 pI am working with a system that sends me webhooks anytime a resource in that system changes. The webhook contains the id of the resource that was updated. For example, if someone edits product ID 1234 in this system, my server will receive an alert saying that product 1234 has changed.  Then I make a request to their API to fetch the newest data for product 1234 and save it to my system.p  pI am building this process to work asynchronously. Meaning, every time I receive a webhook, I save the details to a database table that logs the ID of the resource.  I then have a codeWebhookQueuecode class that contains a coderuncode method, which processes all of the queued requests and updates the appropriate products.

Negative 4075 pI have been seeking a solution to send a pdf generated with JasperServer to a Brother QL700 printer upon js page load from browser, or to at least automatically select and load the label printers settings so the user has not to define the page settings themselves from within the print dialog.p  pHaving the browsers print dialog display has not been the issue. The settings for the particular printer, especially in IE, tend to eventually be forgotten. So, when normally 3 barcode labels would print just fine on three cut paper strips, there will be four strips due to overflow because of the page margins. p  pThe pdf.js library seems as though it could offer some solution, but I have been unable to uncover much so far from its well undocumented codeviewercode library.p  pIs this a reasonable route to take to accomplish this task, or is there a better wayp

Negative 4075 pI have a project Im working on in which I parse a .vbp file which contains a list of paths to assemblies and their GUIDs along with other things. The goal in parsing the file is to use the full path of each assembly to load them, and then use Reflection to get information about each assembly such as its interfaces and the methods and properties they define.p  pNow the code I have so far works just fine on emmanagedem assemblies such as a .exe written in C, however all of these assemblies that are being loaded are emunmanagedem CVB assemblies. When I try callingp  precodevar assemblyPath  Cpath to unmanaged .dll var assemblyObj  Assembly.LoadFromassemblyPath codepre  pon the unmanaged assemblies, I get a BadImageFormat exception, which is expected since it isnt a managed assembly. Ive looked all over for how to go about this but most of the information Ive found so far has been asking about actually using the things defined in unmanaged assemblies. In these instances, the solution required knowing information such as the name of a function the User was trying to get from the unmanaged assembly to utilize in their managed application. The only things I know about the assemblies are their paths, names, and that theyre unmanaged CVB.

Negative 4075 pI am putting together my first ios app with the THREE.js framework. Its a webapp powered by Meteors builtin Cordova capabilities. Everything was going well until I decided to start testing on a physical device as opposed to Chrome 43s device emulator for iphone 6 plus. There is a strange discrepancy in style between the app on the physical device and the Chrome emulator. The emulator, for instance, portrays the rendered objects depth I position the objects in zspace using threes camera in conjunction with the CSS3DRenderer whereas the physical device smashes it to the front of the screen. p  pIm not sure if this is a known issue that has a workaround, or if I have bugs I need to straighten out. p

If you put a print statement at the bottom of the loop, the text will be printed, but only once. I dont know why that is and whether it is a symptom or a cause or both.p  pUpdate 2 It seems like using q.get is causing a problem by stopping the script until there is an item in the queue. I am not quite sure why. I have changed it to queue.getnowait and added a try except. Now when I move the mouse, circles show up but the old ones are not removed and the client crashes after about 3 seconds.p  pUpdate 3 It turns out the old circles were removed, but the server was sending the data of the old circles as if it was a new player. I fixed that bug then made my thread a daemon, because unless it is a daemon when I call sys.exit the thread will not exit and I have to close the command prompt in order to recover. As far as I can tell the code is working as it should. Above is the new, corrected code.p

Basically, I have a codedivcode I can toggle by clicking  on it. This codedivcode changes size over time. I access its codeouterHeightcode as a global variable from the codeclickcode event callback. But the value within the callback scope doesnt get updated, although the value within Backbones Views method gets updated properly. p  pFor instance, on first click, this code might output  p  precodeHeight before click             100 Height during click callback    100 Height after click              100 codepre  pAnd then, after the codedivcode height has changed, I click again and get for instance  p  precodeHeight before click             147 Height during click callback    100 Height after click              147 codepre  pThe value of the codectatheightcode variable gets updated within the method call setting up the callback, but not within the callback scope. p  pFrom what I know about closures, they dont copy global variables value within their scope, but access them via the scope chain. So how come codectatheightcode doesnt get updated properly p  pI am quite sure I can easily find a workaround to this issue, but this wouldnt help me understanding why this is not working. p  pIf someone could explain to me why it acts like this, or point me to an appropriate resource, I would be very thankful  p

Negative 4075 pMy understanding is that in general when you add a handle to the clipboard, the clipboard then owns the handle and you are not responsible for deleting it, and you should not delete it. This is what it says here a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64905128vvs.8529.aspxf255ampMSPPError2147217396 relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms64905128vvs.8529.aspxf255ampMSPPError2147217396ap  blockquote   pIf SetClipboardData succeeds, the system owns the object identified by   the hMem parameter. The application may not write to or free the data   once ownership has been transferred to the system, but it can lock and   read from the data until the CloseClipboard function is called. The   memory must be unlocked before the Clipboard is closed. If the hMem   parameter identifies a memory object, the object must have been   allocated using the function with the GMEMMOVEABLE flag.p blockquote  pAnd indeed I see lots of examples where people call GlobalAlloc, put some text in the global handle, call SetClipboardData, and then dont free the global handle, because the clipboard owns it.p  pBut in the case of HBITMAP data, added via codeSetClipboardDataCFBITMAP, hBitmapcode, I see lots of examples like thesep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7292773384670httpstackoverflow.coma7292773384670ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma28248531384670httpstackoverflow.coma28248531384670ap  pIn these cases, the code emdoesem delete the HBITMAP after adding it to the clipboard.p  pIs there a difference between an HBITMAP handle and a GlobalAlloc handle with respect to the clipboard Is there something special about the CFBITMAP thats an exception to the rule, and the clipboard emcopiesem the handle instead of emownsem it Can you point me to official MSDN documentation that explains the differencep  pstrongEditstrongp  pHere is one more example that involves both types of handle in one article a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles42AllyoueverwantedtoknowabouttheClipboard relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles42AllyoueverwantedtoknowabouttheClipboardap  pNotice that in the case of the bitmap the author specifically saysp  blockquote   pcopy has been made on clipboard so we can deletep blockquote  pstrongEditstrongp  pHere are the results of the experiment encouraged by Jonathan Potter. The handle in question is in the variable codeHBITMAP hbmScreencode. The result of this experiment is that I emcanem access hbmScreen in all of the checkpoints 1 through 4, and emcanem save the correct image at the end. So this tells me that the handle is still mine to use. As I say, I dont think this definitively shows that the handle is not also owned by the clipboard. But since calling codeDeleteObject hbmScreen code after all of this also appears to work without problem, Im going to continue doing that.p  precode    if  OpenClipboard NULL  ampamp EmptyClipboard               BITMAPINFOHEADER bi   0          bi.biSize  sizeof BITMAPINFOHEADER          bi.biPlanes  1         bi.biBitCount  32         bi.biWidth  rcClient.right  rcClient.left         bi.biHeight  rcClient.bottom  rcClient.top         bi.biCompression  BIRGB         bi.biSizeImage  0  3  ScreenX  ScreenY          BYTE lpbitmap  BYTE malloc bi.biWidth  bi.biHeight  4            1 call to make sure we can access hbmScreen here         memset lpbitmap, 0, bi.biWidth  bi.biHeight  4          GetDIBits hdcScreen, hbmScreen, 0, UINTbi.biHeight, lpbitmap, BITMAPINFO ampbi, DIBRGBCOLORS           HANDLE hResult  SetClipboardData CFBITMAP, hbmScreen          CloseClipboard           2 call to check if we can access hbmScreen here         memset lpbitmap, 0, bi.biWidth  bi.biHeight  4          GetDIBits hdcScreen, hbmScreen, 0, UINTbi.biHeight, lpbitmap, BITMAPINFO ampbi, DIBRGBCOLORS           OpenClipboard NULL          EmptyClipboard         CloseClipboard           3 call to check if we can access hbmScreen here         memset lpbitmap, 0, bi.biWidth  bi.biHeight  4          GetDIBits hdcMemDC, hbmScreen, 0, UINTbi.biHeight, lpbitmap, BITMAPINFO ampbi, DIBRGBCOLORS            4 actually use the data from hbmScreen         stdvectorltunsigned chargt image         int n  bi.biWidth  bi.biHeight  4         image.resize n          int i  0         for  int y  bi.biHeight  1  y gt 0  y                       for  int x  0  x lt bi.biWidth  x                               int base   y  bi.biWidth  x   4                 image[ i ]  lpbitmap[ base  2 ]  r                 image[ i ]  lpbitmap[ base  1 ]  g                 image[ i ]  lpbitmap[ base ]  b                 image[ i ]  lpbitmap[ base  3 ]  a                               free lpbitmap          unsigned error  lodepngencode Ca.png, image, bi.biWidth, bi.biHeight       codepre

Negative 4075 pIve inherited something thats way above my current whatevafu p  pThe KDEPIM Zanshin project uses stdmemfn in a number of locations throughout its code, and it turns out that at least 1 version of Apples clang the one shipped with the latest Xcode available for OS X 10.9 generates object code that fails to link for a number of the files involved.p  pIt turns out to be possible to circumvent the issue by using boostmemfn instead of stdmemfn . The projects main author is not inclined to increase the boost dependency on all platforms, so I proposed a patch in which a conditional macro is used that expands to boostmemfn when required.p  pThe request is now to create a template function that lives in one of zanshins own namespaces Utilsmemfnf and that returns either stdmemfnf or boostmemfnf. And thats the part thats either way above my current paygrade ... or that is simply not feasible independent of the fact that I hardly even understand the purpose of the memfn function.p  pSo the question is is there an emeasyem, compact way to wrap stdmemfn, ideally with a single template function p  pThe main hurdle appears to be the return type, but since all uses in zanshins code appear to return what boils down to a function pointer, I tried using a void return type. I expected that to fail, and indeed it did.p  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 4075 pIm just going to post what I have so far and try to describe the problem.p  pThe script bellow tracks a transform object with custom attributes. It creates an interface to easily codegetcode and codesetcode to a maya nodes attributes. This makes it easy to save attribute values into a scene that can load with the scene in the future. In the script I was using OpenMaya to track a dagObject, but simplified to try to work through the problem first.

My pdfs are in a network folder where I cant use an URL, so what I do is reading it through phpp  precodefile  CCargosdata.pdf  trying it out first with filesystem headerContenttype applicationpdf headerContentDisposition inline filenamedoc.pdf headerContentTransferEncoding binary headerAcceptRanges bytes readfilefile codepre  pThe problem is that the output of this is somewhat garbage, this is the binary raw data of the pdf and I havent found a way to load it, this is the response from ajax call p  pCreator Canon iRADV C5235  PDF CreationDate D201509281524040200 Producer 376377000A000d000o000b000e000 000P000S000L000 0001000.000 2000e000 000f000o000r000 000C000a000n000o000n000000 x  TU8Lt2CWnjH8I2lQp  pIt goes on and on, I just cut it here.p  pI have made it work if I move the pdf to one temp folder with a fixed name and reload an iframe always pointing to that URL, but I feel that this is a really bad solution. p  pAny help on reading this binary input and displaying it Thanks.p
