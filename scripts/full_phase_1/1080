However, the explanation on how to do was absent or at most, vague, and while I could find info on that theorem, I didnt find any further explanationcode examples on how to adapt it for the question at hand.p  pSo, I come to you asking a charitable soul for more information, possibly a C, JavaScript or pseudocode example, of how could one use CohenSutherland algorithm to efficiently detect the intersection between a line and a rectangle.

Since age can change any day I figured a script might be the best idea.p  pFirst thing I did, was to create a stored procedure which computes the age given the birthday as datetime. Here is what I came up withp  precodeUSE [MyDB] SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO  CREATE PROCEDURE CalculateAge dayOfBirth datetime, age INT OUTPUT AS  DECLARE today datetime, thisYearBirthDay datetime DECLARE years int  SET today  GETDATE SET thisYearOfBirth  DATEADDyear, dayOfBirth, today, dayOfBirth SET years  DATEDIFFyear, dayOfBirth, today  CASE WHEN thisYearBirthDay gt today THEN 1 ELSE 0 END SET age  years codepre  pAfterwards I created another script which runs through all records that have a non null dayOfBirth attribute and updates the age filled accordingly.p  precodeUSE [MyDB] GO  DECLARE age int DECLARE birth datetime DECLARE id intl DECLARE cursorQuery CURSOR FOR SELECT clientId FROM Clients WHERE dayOfBirth IS NOT NULL  OPEN cursorQuery  FETCH NEXT FROM cursorQuery INTO id  WHILE FETCHSTATUS  0 BEGIN     SET birth  SELECT dayOfBirth from Kunden where clientIdid     EXEC dbo.CalculateAge birth, age OUTPUT     UPDATE Clients SET Age  age WHERE clientId  id     FETCH NEXT FROM cursorQuery INTO id END  CLOSE cursorQuery DEALLOCATE cursorQuery codepre  pI would trigger the script above once per day to populate the age attribute. Thats what I have so far, but I have the feeling there is plenty of room for improvement. p  p Thanks Sung Meister p  pI ended up with something like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE Client   ID int identity1,1 primary key, DOB datetime null, AGE as case     when DOB is null then null     else DATEDIFFYY,DOB,GETDATE  CASE WHEN MONTHGETDATE  MONTHDOB AND DAYDOB gt DAYGETDATE OR MONTHGETDATE gt MONTHDOB THEN 1 ELSE 0 END     end       codepre
Negative 1080 pI have this big graph of edges and vertices in 2D space. The big graph is returned by a function computed in a C library. I am reading this graph and using it to compute all the intersections of its edges the lines segements. I use sweep algorithm. For detecting the intersection of two edges I have though some problems. I have 4 different methods according to which I test if two edges intersect and if affirmative I compute and retain their intersectionp  ol lipOne which test if the two edges are the diagonals of a polygon. that is the coordinates of the edges of one line inserted into the equation of the other line have different signs.pli lipOne which computes the intersection each time and check whether the found intersection is between the endpoints of both segments.pli lipOne which is the code from a hrefhttpworkshop.evolutionzone.com20070910code2dlineintersection relnofollowthis linka implemented in C though.pli lipOne which implements the first method proposed by Jason Cohen n a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions563198howdoyoudetectwheretwolinesegmentsintersect706262706262this questiona.pli ol  pThe problem reduces to this question Do two lines from A to B and from C to D intersect Then you can ask it four times between the line and each of the four sides of the rectangle.p  pHeres the vector math for doing it. Im assuming the line from A to B is the line in question and the line from C to D is one of the rectangle lines. My notation is that Ax is the xcoordinate of A and Cy is the ycoordinate of C. And  means dotproduct, so e.g.p  precodeAB  AxBx  AyBy. E  BA   BxAx, ByAy  F  DC   DxCx, DyCy   P   Ey, Ex  h   AC  P    F  P  codepre  pThis h number is the key. If h is between 0 and 1, the lines intersect, otherwise they dont. If FP is zero, of course you cannot make the calculation, but in this case the lines are parallel and therefore only intersect in the obvious cases. The exact point of intersection is C  Fh. If h is exactly 0 or 1 the lines touch at an endpoint. You can consider this an intersection or not as you see fit.p  pFor data that I created small data with double values I obtained good results with all the 4 implemented methods. When I use anyone of these methods implemented in C on the data from the big graph I get different results each time and not good resultsp  ol lipmethod returns much more intersections that I need all the points are on the graph but I get too many points.pli lipI always obtain 0 intersections no matter what.pli lipI get a lot more intersection than in 1.pli lipFor some example I get points which are not on the graph so not even the intersection. But for some examples I get the intersection points plus some other points.pli ol  pI have no idea where the problem can be. Any suggestion or any other idea on how to compute the intersection and test it moreover are ore than welcomed. thank you, madalinap

Negative 1080 pWe have an application that is comprised of a couple of off the shelf PHP applications ExpressionEngine and XCart as well as our own custom code.p  pI did not do the actual analysis so I dont know precisely how it was determined, but am not surprised to hear that too many MySQL connections are being left unclosed I am not surprised because I have been seeing significant memory leakage on our dev server, where over the course of a day or two, starting from 100MB upon initial boot, the entire gig of ram gets consumed, and very little of it is cached.p  pSo, how do we go about determining precisely which PHP code is the culprit  Ive got prior experience with XDebug, and have suggested that, when weve gotten our separate, staging environment reasonably stable, that we retrofit XDebug on dev and use that to do some analysis.  Is this reasonable, andor does anybody else have more specific andor additional suggestionsp

Negative 1080 pI have an app that has a progress bar amp spawns a worker thread to do some work amp report back progress.

Negative 1080 pI have several tables in my SQL2008 DB, ManagersManagerID is a PK, incremental and CustomersCustomerID is a PK, incremental are among them. All ID columns are int. They are connected with junction table ManagersCustomersfields CustomerID is a PK, ManagerID and there are relations from CustomerID in Customers to same in junction table with delete cascade rule and from ManagerID in Managers to same in junction table with delete cascade too. So I have Managers 0..1 to  Customers relation in my edmx model after generating it from my DB and I can see this relation is mapped to junction table. I tested junction table in SQL Server Management Studio, it works correctly. Ok. In my app I have 2 parts  edmx model on server side connected with client side through WCF Data Service. In client part Im creating instance of my entities class, and in debug mode I can watch entities class instances data. Both entities Customers and Managers are filled with data correctly, but in navigation fields I can see only 0. For example I have Customer with CustomerID  1 connected with Manager with ManagerID3 and there is a record in junction table. So, if it would work correctly, I would see my manager in navigation field of Customers entity and same with customer nav field in Managers entity. But I can see only zeros.p

Negative 1080 pWhen you attach a file to an email using the ACTIONSEND intent with the extra EXTRASTREAM does the email app copy that attached file to its own location My app creates a file and attaches it to an email, but this can happen many times and I would like to be able to delete this file when it is no longer needed so it doesnt flood the users storage with junk data. Is the file safe to delete after the email intent has startedp

Negative 1080 pI have an ASP MVC web app and on one of the pages there is a set of Main checkboxes with subcheckboxes underneath them.

Negative 1080 pI have a suspicion that there might be a race condition in a certain C multithreading situation involving virtual method calls in a vtable dynamic dispatching implementation for which a vtable pointer is stored as a hidden member in the object with virtual methods.  I would like to confirm whether or not this is actually an issue, and I am specifying boosts threading library so we can assume some frame of reference.p  pSuppose an object O has a boostmutex member for which the entirety of its constructordestructor and methods are scopelocked on similar to the Monitor concurrency pattern.  A thread A constructs an object O on the heap without external synchronization ie WITHOUT an shared mutex enclosing the new operation, for which it could synchronize with other threads note, though, that there is still the internal, Monitor mutex locking the scope of its constructor.  The thread A then passes a pointer to the O instance which it just constructed to another thread B, by means of a synchronized mechanismfor instance, a synchronized readerswriters queue note only the pointer to the object is being passednot the object itself.  After construction, neither thread A or any other threads perform any writing operation on the O instance which A constructed.p  pThe thread B reads the pointer value of the object O from the synchronized queue, after which it immediately leaves the critical section guarding the queue.  Then the thread B performs a virtual method call on the object O.  Here is where I think an issue may arise.p  pNow, my understanding of virtual method calls in a [quite probable] vtable implementation of dynamic dispatching is that the calling thread B must dereference the pointer to O in order to obtain the vtable pointer stored as a hidden member of its object, and that this happens BEFORE the method body is entered naturally because the method body to execute is not safely and accurately determined until vtable pointer stored in the object itself is accessed.  Assuming the aforementioned statements are possibly true for such an implementation, is this not a race conditionp  pSince the vtable pointer is retrieved by thread B by dereferencing the pointer to the object O located in the heap prior to any memory visibility guaranteeing operations taking place ie acquiring the member variable mutex in the object O, then it is not certain that B will perceive the vtable pointer value that A originally wrote on the object Os construction, correct ie, it may instead perceive a garbage value, resulting in undefined behavior, correct.p  pIf the above is a valid possibility, does this not imply that making virtual method calls on exclusively internally synchronized objects that are shared between threads is undefined behaviorp  pAndlikewisesince the standard is agnostic to a vtable implementation, how could one ever guarantee that the vtable pointer is safely visible to other threads prior to a virtual call  I suppose one could externally synchronize externally as in, for instance, surrounding with a shared mutex lockunlock block the constructor call and then at least the initial virtual method call in each of the threads, but this seems like some awfully discordant programming.p  pSo, if my suspicions are true, then a possibly more elegant solution would be to use inlined, nonvirtual member functions which lock the member mutex and then subsequently forward to a virtual call.  Buteven thencould we guarantee that the constructor initialized the vtable pointer within the confines of the lock and unlock guarding the constructor body itselfp  pIf someone could help me clear this up and confirmdeny my suspicions, I would be very grateful.p  pEDIT code demonstrating the abovep  precodeclass Interface      public     virtual Interface      virtual void dynamicCall  0   class Monitor  public Interface      boostmutex mutex     public     Monitor              boostuniquelockltboostmutexgt lockmutex          initialize          virtual Monitor              boostuniquelockltboostmutexgt lockmutex          destroy          virtual void dynamicCall              boostuniquelockltboostmutexgt lockmutex          do we         for simplicity, the numbers following each statement specify the order of execution, and these two functions are assumed  void passMonitorToSharedQueue Interface  monitor          Thread A passes the monitor pointer value to a          synchronized queue, pushes it on the queue, and then          notifies Thread B that a new entry exists  Interface  getMonitorFromSharedQueue         Thread B blocks until Thread A notifies Thread B         that a new Interface  can be retrieved,at which         point it retrieves and returns it void threadBFunc      Interface  if  getMonitorFromSharedQueue  1     ifgtdynamicCall  4 ISSUE HERE  void threadAFunc      Interface  monitor  new Monitor  2     passMonitorToSharedQueuemonitor  3  codepre  p at point 4 Im under the impression that the vtable pointer value which Thread A wrote to memory may not be visible by Thread B, as I dont see any reason to assume that the compiler will generate code such that the vtable pointer is written within the constructors locked mutex block.p  pFor instance, consider the situation of multicore systems where each core has a dedicated cache.  According to a hrefhttpwww.linuxjournal.comarticle8211 relnofollowthis articlea, caches are commonly aggressively optimized anddespite forcing cache coherencedo not enforce a strict ordering on cache coherence if there are no synchronization primitives involved.p  pPerhaps I am misunderstanding the implications of the article, but wouldnt that mean that As write of the vtable pointer to the constructed object and there is no indication that this write occurs within a the constructors locked mutex block may not be perceived by B before B reads the vtable pointer  If both A and B are executed on different cores A on core0 and B on core1, the cache coherence mechanism may reorder the update of the vtable pointer value in core1s cache the update that would make it consistent with the value of the vtable pointer in core0s cache, which A wrote such that it occurs after Bs read ... if Im  interpreting the article correctly.p

However many sites allow you to reset your password or authenticate your emailuser by clicking a link embedded in the email.

Negative 1080 pIm writing a Windows CE application, and I want to play a sound a short wav file when something happens. Since this sound will be played often, my first instinct was to load the wav file into a memory stream and reuse that stream instead of reading the file every time.p  pBut then it occured to me that these Windows Mobile devices only have emoneem kind of memory, which is used embothem for data storage  the file system as well as for program memory theres even a nice slider in the control panel which you can use to delegate memory to either storage or program execution. So, theoretically, reading a file from the file system or some value from a SQL Server CE database should take almost the same amount of time as reading this value from some inmemory object, rightp  pIs this assumption correct i.e., inmemory caching on application level doesnt make sense here or did I miss something For simplicity, lets assume that only the internal memory of the device is used no memory card.p

Negative 1080 pIm using jQueryUIs accordion plugin with hash tag navigation, but Im running into a problem. Each page of my site has an accordion widget on it.

It passes the hash tag into the address bar, but it doesnt open the accordion panel unless you refresh the page.

Negative 1080 pIm attempting to capture a rendered screen from a Managed DirectX application.  Typically, the way to do this is as followsp  precodeSurface renderTarget  device.GetRenderTarget0 SurfaceLoader.SavesnapshotName, ImageFileFormat.Bmp, renderTarget codepre  pWhich is in my understanding shorthand for something likep  precodeSurface renderTarget  device.GetRenderTarget0 Surface destTarget  device.CreateOffscreenPlainSurfaceClientRectangle.Width, ClientRectangle.Height, graphicsSettings.WindowedDisplayMode.Format, Pool.SystemMemory device.GetRenderTargetDatarenderTarget,destTarget SurfaceLoader.SavesnapshotName,ImageFileFormat.Bmp, destTarget codepre  pThe problem is that on older video cards which dont support nonpoweroftwo dimension textures, the above fails.  Ive tried a number of workarounds, but nothing seems to accomplish this seemingly simple task of saving arbitrarydimensioned screen captures.  For example, the following fails on new Bitmap with an invalid parameter exception note that this requires creating the device with PresentFlag.LockableBackBufferp  precodeSurface surf  mdevice.GetRenderTarget0 GraphicsStream gs  surf.LockRectangleLockFlags.ReadOnly Bitmap bmp  new Bitmapgs bmp.SavesnapshotName, ImageFormat.Png surf.UnlockRectangle codepre  pAny tips would be greatly appreciated...Ive pretty much exhausted everything I can think of or turn up on Google...p

Negative 1080 pHello everyone in stackoverflow land,p  pA while back I did a website for a friend of mine and I did this weird jquery code for the front page of his site.  The short story is he first started out wanting a fade in and fade out with panels with the top navigation separate to having both top navigation highlighted and the panels to fade in and fade out. I had little time to change the HTML and graphics so I no choice, but to do it in jquery with each individual button.  So my question is......  Is there a way I can consolidate this code so If I have 7 or more buttonsp  pThanks for the help.

Negative 1080 pThis is a general question that has come up for debate.  What do you recommend we use to enable a Winforms client to talk to a Windows Service.  Our scenario is this  We have a Windows Service C .Net Framework 4.0 that imports lots of different data into a database in batches.p  pThe windows client would enable the user to monitor batch progress in realtime, restart batches, and do other simple configuration tasks.p  pIm interested in a little friendly debate over which technologiesapproaches to use and why.  Socket connections, remoting, WCF, whatever you have used in the past.p  pIf anybody has a link to a working sample, that would be wonderful.p  pThere are lots of problems to consider here... threading, network distance and performance, etc...  Ideally Id like this to work tolerably well over a VPN connection, but it isnt a strict requirement.p  pThanksp

Negative 1080 pI have an IIS server running PHP on an Apache Module. I am running a domain on it, and this domain has a seperate setup for email which uses an exchange server. When I try to send email from the website using php mail the exchange server rejects it. I.e. the header from line is senderthisdomain.com and it is sending to receiverthisdomain.com, both are email addresses set up in the exchange, even though the sender has no direct relationship with exchange.p  pThe emails are not getting through. We tried using a Yahoo adress in the from line but nothing. Has anyone ever come across a problem like this.p
Negative 1080 pIve made this question couple of days ago a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5723049whatisthebestapproachtodevelopavideochatwebapplicationinjavaflexoWhat is the best approach to develop a video chat web application in Java Flex or JMFa thanks to the answers given there weve decided to implement it with Flex  Red5, so the question now is, how can we implement Red5 into the existing Spring Web application We can take advantages as much as we can of the Spring Security configuration that is currently in the Spring application and be able to call all the bussiness logic in there. So we are wondering if Red5 has to be deployed in a separate server or if we can somehow deploy it under the same Spring application as a separate servlet thus being able to use the same Spring Security configuration to secure the Red5 server We know that Red5 configuration is based on Spring and for that reason we suppose that we can deploy it as another servlet together with Spring... is it possible or we have to deploy Red5 in another server and configure another Spring security instance inside itp

Negative 1080 pIve just added the jQuery UI combobox to a page. It seems it restricts selections to only those passed in or present in the select list.

In some devices like Galaxy S the status of the file says it is deleted, but it is still present in the gallery.

Negative 1080 pemProblememp  pIm trying to display a small amount of text using complex scripts such as Arabic and Bengali on mobile devices specifically Android, BlackBerry phones, and BlackBerry PlayBook. The app is a hrefhttpssites.google.comsiteficksworkshopallergytraveler relnofollowAllergy Travelera These devices both fail to correctly display the text, but for different reasons.p  pOn Android and PlayBook, I can supply a font in which case the characters display, but the characters are not connected correctly. Each character displays without considering the context.p  pOn BlackBerry, the device doesnt have appropriate fonts. I can supply a font, but the font file far exceeds the maximum font size 70kB.p  pemProposed Solutionemp  pI think the process of correctly using context to display a word is called reshaping. Presumably, this takes the text and returns an alternative set of characters to display. My proposed solution is to do this reshaping in advance. On Android, this would ensure the text correctly uses the context, and on BlackBerry, this would allow me to remove unused characters, and reduce the font size.p  pemQuestionemp  pAre there any APIs to do this reshaping or any other suggestions Im willing to use any technology on Windows or Linux eg a Win32 API, Perl, Python, Java, ...p  pThanks for all the suggestions.p

Negative 1080 peveryone. I actually have two questions, somewhat related.p  pQuestion 1 Why is gcc letting me declare variables after action statements I thought the C89 standard did not allow this. GCC Version 4.4.3 It even happens when I explicitly use codestdc89code on the compile line. I know that most compilers implement things that are nonstandard, i.e. C compilers allowing codecode comments, when the standard does not specify that. Id like to learn just the standard, so that if I ever need to use emjustem the standard, I dont snag on things like this.p  pQuestion 2 How do you cope without objects in C I program as a hobby, and I have not yet used a language that does not have Objects a.k.a. OO concepts  I already know some C, and Id like to learn how to use C on its own. Supposedly, one way is to make a POD struct and make functions similar to codeStructNameconstructorcode, codeStructNamedoSomethingcode, etc. and pass the struct instance to each function  is this the proper way, or am I totally offp  pEDIT Due to some minor confusion, I am defining what my second question is more clearly I am not asking codeHow do I use Objects in Ccode I am asking codeHow do you manage without objects in Ccode, a.k.a. how do you accomplish things without objects, where youd normally use objectsp  pIn advance, thanks a lot.

Negative 1080 pI am writing a plugin for an application that includes NumPy in the binary distribution, but not SciPy.  My plugin needs to interpolate data from one regular 3D grid to another regular 3D grid.

Negative 1080 pmy first question on stackoverflow and Im hoping its not a stupid one. p  pBasically all my datadriven tests look like this onep  precode[TestMethod] [DataSourceTestsDataSource] public void TestWithSomeFancyName     if myIsThisTestIgnored return ... codepre  pDataSource attribute  app.config connectionstring  excel odbc driver  excel datadriven tests.p  pcodemyIsThisTestIgnoredcode is set in the code[TestInitialize]code method for every datarow there is a separate test with separate code[TestInitialize]code, via codeTestContext.DataRow[Ignore]code, so I can ignore tests via some truefalse in an excel sheet. p  pstrongNow my problem isstrong just returning from a test method lets the test pass. How to not let the ignored tests pass in the MSTEST testrunner and in the CI via msbuild, or even better, do not show them at allp  pOn our Ci Build, it sums up every ignored a.k.a passed test, as the count of test is codedatarows x numbercode of testmethods, giving a faulty impression of the number of tests that ran. But, until now, I found no way to just set the test result to ignored or any other state than passesfailed programmatically.p  pBesides, getting rid of this annoying ignore line in every test and enhancing the assert messages without wrapping every assert in some function would be nice, too.p  pSo the bestonly approach to this, I thought, would be AOP style programming and using custom attributes. I found this old post about enhancing your mstest code with custom attributes, good read a hrefhttpcallumhibbert.blogspot.com200801extendingmstest.html relnofollowhttpcallumhibbert.blogspot.com200801extendingmstest.htmlap  pSpecifically the last comment in the linked article got me thinking, as the guy not just made my day by showing how to access all test state data to the attribute the MarshalObject stuff, but somehow he got it working, quoting him emIn this manner, I can determine whether or not to run a test based on a matrix of data driven information from the text context using the DataSource attribute, and the new custom attributes I created. em. strongYeah.. but how to do thatstrongp  pI took some of the code and implemeted it, looking something like thatp  precodepublic class MyCustomAspect  TestAspectltMyCustomAttributegt, IMessageSink, ITestAspect  ....      [SecurityPermissionSecurityAction.LinkDemand, Flags  SecurityPermissionFlag.Infrastructure]     public IMessage SyncProcessMessageIMessage msg             ....        see last comment in linked article to how to get this MarshalObject       MyTestsClass testClass  MyTestsClassMarshalObject        iftestClass.myTestInitializeRan ampamp testClass.myIsThisTestIgnored                 what to do here I would like to get rid of the SyncProcessMessage invocation, but...          return msg or null gt Exception The method was called with a Message of an unexpected type.          constructing a IMessage in an easy way specifically CallMessage seems not possible, and I have no clue how to construct a valid CallMessage that says ignore test              else                IMessage message  nextSink.SyncProcessMessagemsg         return message        codepre  pAgain I want to suppress the testrun for this datarow, or set the testresult somehow to ignoreunknown.p  pDoing anything with the returned codemessagecode or codemsgcode seems pointless, as the codeIMessagecode Interface just exposes the codePropertiescode Dictionary which has only some MethodName and stuff in it, nothing interesting it seems. p  pCasting codeIMessagecode to concrete implementations doesnt work they are all internal to System.Runtime. Though one can cast to ResultMessage and it returns something  null when an exception was raised so you can take the exception message and adjust error message via new throw.p  pAny Ideas And many thanks for reading so far. p

Negative 1080 pIm getting an OutofMemoryError for my android application, and am a bit confused as to whats going on. Basically what happens is, Im able to run it the first few times, but when I try to quit out of it and then open it again quickly and repetitively, I get an out of memory error.p  pIve tried researching this topic, and have found that the recycle method has commonly been the problem. However, Ive called the recycle method on each of the bitmaps which are stored in an object container, stored in an arraylist, but was still getting the problem. p  pAfter doing this, I tried using the Eclipse Memory Analyzer to look at heap dumps, when I came across something weird. After quitting out of the activity back into the launcher activity, and then opening up the activity again via a button, I took screenshots of the heap dump using the memory analyzer. It turns out, with each time I quit and reentered the activity, another instance of the activity object was being created, and the old ones werent being released, even though the onDestroy method was being called which also had the recyclecleanup code. p  pI then tried overriding the finalize method to see if it was being called when the activity quit out back into the launcher activity, but it wasnt being called. I read on some other stackoverflow threads that finalize isnt always called, so in the end, Im still not sure whats going on.p  pstrongUltimately, my question is thisstrong How am I supposed to ensure that the Activity object the activity object itself, not the stuff created from the activity is released after quitting out from the activity into another activityp

Negative 1080 pOkay, so for the past couple of weeks, my friend brah and I have been working on an MVC based framework. However, we dont know the best way to go about loading other classesmethods.p  pAt first, we used a loader, which allowed us to call any specific class we wanted, and then the corresponding method codeBootstraploadgtBaseModelgtquerycode. However, this approach didnt seem very effective, as almost every classmethod for the most part has to either load another Controller, Model andor View. This meant there would be a lot of calling codeBootstraploadcode, which made the classes longer, and less organized.p  pHeres the main Bootstrap class, which is called in the index, and everything is basically built from herep  precodeclass Bootstrap       public static load      public function construct           requireonce SlaveBaseLoader.php          selfload  new Loader          thisgtload  selfload            public function build           BootstraploadgtBaseController          BootstraploadgtControllerPagesgtloadGET[src]         codepre  pHeres what our loader looked like, which was set to a static inside Bootstrapp  precodeclass Loader extends Bootstrap       public static classes  array      public function construct           do nothing            public function callmethod, arg  null           ifisobjectthisgtclasses[method]               url  Slave . strreplace, , method . .php              iffileexists url                     requireonce url                  thisgtclasses[method]  new methodcountargs gt 0  args  null                    else                  triggererror Cannot find class . method. within  . url . , EUSERERROR                                   return thisgtclasses[model]         codepre  pTherefore, we decided to set the child classes for Controller, Model and View in the construct of each one, allowing us to do something like this codethisgtModelgtUsergtregistercode in side of the User Controller. Although, there were issues with this as well. It didnt allow us to call codeparentconstructcode inside a child class if we had set that child class i.e. User Controller to codethisgtUser  BootstraploadgtControllerUsercode in in the parent class i.e. Controller.p  pThis also meant that every class had to be called, even if wasnt needed for that specific page.p  pFor example, this is what our main Controller class would look likep  precodeclass BaseController extends Bootstrap       public Model      public Validate      public View      public function construct            Call Other Classes           thisgtModel  BootstraploadgtBaseModel          thisgtView   BootstraploadgtBaseView           Call Other Functions           thisgtValidate  BootstraploadgtControllerValidate         codepre  pSo to be clear, wed like to be able to do something like this, in any classmethodp  precodethisgtModelgtquery  thisgtControllergtValidategtcharsstring codepre  p..or like this, since we are looking at it from the perspective of the Controllerp  precodethisgtModelgtquery  thisgtValidategtcharsstring codepre  pAs oppose to having to do something like the Bootstrap loader methodp  precodeBootstraploadgtBaseModelgtquery  BootstraploadgtController  BootstraploadgtControllerValidategtcharsstring codepre  pBut without having to set each child class in Controller, Model and View.p  pSo, what would the best way to call methods in MVC Any help is appreciatedp

Negative 1080 pOk I have this neat little piece of JQuery I have been working on.  It takes the text fields title as the default text...so as to allow me to use the value for its intended purpose.  On focus, the title disappears and allows the user to input.  On blur, it works great...keeping the input from the user.  The problem becomes the fact I cant get the value to work  For example, when a user submits a form with errors, it spits them back to the form, and even though I have the POST variable in the value to avoid the user having to reenter it, its still putting the title portion of the text input.  To avoid confusion, the input from the user is still processed great.  strongIm just trying to get the value to work as the default text in case there are form errors.strong  p  pThe field is like sop  precodeltinput idregisterField classidleField titleFirst Name typetext namefirstname valueltphp ifissetPOST[firstname]echo htmlentitiesPOST[firstname]gt gt codepre  pHeres the JQueryp  precodeinput[typetext][title].eachfunction    this.valthis.attrtitle   if.trimthis.val       this.valthis.attrtitle   this     .focusfunction        ifthis.val  this.attrtitle this.val          .blurfunction        if.trimthis.val   this.valthis.attrtitle       codepre  pI also am more than welcoming scraping my strategy for anything you guys might have that works great for you  Thanks a ton for the helpp

Negative 1080 pI just started working with another developer and we were talking about different version control solution so our projects will go smoother. We decided that git was the best option since we both knew how to use it already.

Negative 1080 pThe problem consists in choosing the best option at every moment of the game following these rulesp  ul lipYou can only pick the leftmost or the rightmost card.pli lipYour opponent will ALWAYS pick first, and will ALWAYS choose the highest card from either the leftmost or the rightmost card.

Negative 1080 pHas anyone ever used Solrnet inside CLR Stored Procedures I would really appreciate pointers to some good tutorials. p  pOne problem Im facing is that I cant find a way to include the SolrNet library as a reference to the VS 2008 Database SQL Server Project.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSo it seems that when you have an SQL Server Project, and you want to add a reference to a library, it has to first exist in SQL Server itself, which makes sense. This is done by creating an assembly in SQL Server from the DLL itself with the following SQLp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeCREATE ASSEMBLY SolrNet FROM CCLRSPSolrNet.dll  WITH   PERMISSIONSET  UNSAFE codepre  pNote that emUNSAFEem might have some repercussions on the security of the database however it is ok for me for nowp  pHowever the SolrNet.dll requires other library dependencies such as emCastle.Windsor.dllem which in itself requires emSystem.Core.dllem and emNinject.dllem. I found the required version of emCastle.Windsor.dllem which is 2.5.1.0 and also emSystem.Core.Dllem which was in the .Net folder of Windows, however I cannot find the required version of emNinject.dllem which should be 2.1.0.76. I have attempted to create assembly version 2.2 but, as expected, it did not do the job.p  pI searched for it on different repositories but could not find it. Does anyone know where I could find this version of DLLp  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pSo after lots of searching over the net, I still didnt manage to find emNinject.dll v2.1.0.76em. My next attempt was to use the next version of SolrNet which is v0.4.0.2002. This version required emNinject.dll v2.2em which I had already found. So my current status is registering all other libraries in SQL Server which are dependencies of emSolrNet.dllem. I will leave this open to document my process just in case there will be someone having the same problem.p  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pI have managed to register all required libraries some of which I got from SolrNet source on a hrefhttpsgithub.commauschSolrNettreemasterlib relnofollowGitHuba. So now, SolrNet is registered as an assembly in SQL Server, and therefore I can reference it from the .NET SQL Server Project for creating the CLR Stored Procedure. So I have written a very simple CLR SP which connects to SOLR and retrieves a piece of data. Code belowp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecode[Microsoft.SqlServer.Server.SqlProcedure] public static void PrintToday      SqlPipe p     p  SqlContext.Pipe     p.SendHelloooo       Open Solr instance     SolrNet.Startup.InitltActiveProductgthttp192.168.2.1908983solr       Get instance of ActiveProduct     ISolrOperationsltActiveProductgt operations  ActiveProduct.GetActiveProductSolrOperations       Prepare QueryOptions.

The exact output that I see in SQL Server Management Studio is the followingp  precodeHelloooo Msg 6522, Level 16, State 1, Procedure PrintToday, Line 0 A .NET Framework error occurred during execution of user defined routine or aggregate PrintToday  System.ApplicationException Key SolrNet.Impl.SolrConnection.CLRStoredProcedures2.ActiveProduct.SolrNet.Impl.SolrConnection already registered in container System.ApplicationException     at SolrNet.Utils.Container.RegisterString key, Type serviceType, Converter2 factory    at SolrNet.Utils.Container.Register[T]String key, Converter2 factory    at SolrNet.Startup.Init[T]ISolrConnection connection    at SolrNet.Startup.Init[T]String serverURL    at StoredProcedures.PrintToday codepre  pemPrintTodayem is the name of the CLR StoredProcedurep  pemCLRStoredProcedures2em is the name of the .NET SQL Server project and default namespace in VS 2008p  pemActiveProductem is the name of the document in Solr, and the cs class with Solr annotationsp  pAs can be seen from the output, the first codePipe.sendHellooocode is doing its job therefore the SP works fine until there.p  pWhen I searched for the above error, I found out that it will show when one tries to register Solr instance twice in the same application. Now I dont see where I am registering the instance twice. Am I missing something herep  pNote that the above cs function worked fine when executed in a cs console application developed on my machine. Another detail which might be important is that the SOLR Server is being hosted on my machine which is on the same network of my SQL Server 2005.p  pstrongUpdate 4strongp  pFor starters, the error I mentioned above in update 3 does not fire when the SP is executed the 1st time just after deployment lets assume that the 1st time works for now since I have another error which Im currently working on fixing, the error fires when the SP is executed again afterwards. So it seems that whatever codeSolrNet.Startup.InitltActiveProductgthttp192.168.2.1908983solrcode is doing creating some sort of session that has to do with a container I think when called from the SP it is not releasing the session therefore the 2nd time and each time afterwards the SP is executed, the error is fired. Is there a way to sort of stop the session or releasing from the container. What I can do as a workaround is to codetry  catchcode the codeSolrNet.Startup.Initcode part, however this is not clean.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1080 pLately, Ive been trying to setup a media center PC. Ive played around with all the common media center applications like XBMC, Plex, Boxee, and WMC. But all of them have one issue or another. So I was thinking about writing my own application from scratch.p  pMy problem is I have no experience with developing software that plays media such as videos or music. Im also not interested in spending a huge amount of time trying to figure this out, considering all the different file formats and codecs out there. Im really more interested in developing the database and library interface for my application and reusing someone elses control or code for actually playing the media.p  pOne option I was thinking was to just control an existing media player externally. So for example you may browse for a video to play in my application, and then when you hit play it would fire up VideoLAN or some other popular video player.p  pHowever, I was wondering if there was an easy way to play video inside a .NET application. Im looking for something that is capable of playing a wide variety of formats such as MKV files, and DVD ISOs. Im more experience with WinForms, but was also thinking about using this project as an opportunity to learn WPF.p

Negative 1080 pIm using a Relative layout as the root or parent container and I have two buttons to place inside this Layout. The buttons need to be placed one on top of the other. The problem is that I want to position these buttons so that they appear below the center of the view but not directly below. That is within the bottom half of the view I want the buttons to appear halfway along that half portion. I tried adding a the buttons as children of a RelativeLayout that was centered in the middle inside the parent RelativeLayout and that sort of achieves what Im trying to but then the Eclipse complains with a warning stating that one set of Relative Layout tags is useless and that I should consider getting rid of it.p  pThen I tried giving a one of the buttons a top margin with respect to its parent and then placing the other button under the this button with the top margin. This seems to work until I try it out in other virtual devices and I find out that depending on the screen sizes and dimensions it might or might not appear where I want it to especially not the case with tablet devices. p  pOk, so then Im not sure how to achieve what I want the right way without warnings or errors.

Negative 1080 pAs JSONP requests are created in the following wayp  precodevar scriptdocument.createElementscript script.srcurl script.onLoadfunctiondosomething document.body.appendChildscript codepre  pMy question is that, is there a w3c standard, crossbrowser supported event like onBeforeLoad which in turn let us stop executing downloaded script, in case it is not a wellformed JSONP response, or it is not passing through some predefined scheme validation, or just in case it consists of some harmful codebasic script validation I know of the onBeforeLoad event supported in some browser out there, but focusing on the downloaded script datasource and in any of the reasons stated above,  it would be extemely useful to have crossbrowser access to the loading script source, and due to good reasons,  the possibility to stop the execution, just before it is started.p  pFor example the above script could be the followingp  precodevar scriptdocument.createElementscript script.srcurl script.onBeforeLoadfunction        ifjson.parseJsonthis.dataSource ampamp            json.validateAgainstschema,this.dataSource                   return false                else           return true          if onBeforeLoad return true, onLoad will not be fired script.onLoadfunctiondosomething document.body.appendChildscript codepre  pI know that JSONP is all about trust in the 3rd party javascript module, hence i sometime wish that if i could validate those modules just before i am using it.p

For example, I have this function which is basically the opposite of the function abovep  precodetemplate ltgt inline sfVector2i luaUtoltgtluaState L, int index      return sfVector2i         luaUgetfieldltintgtL, index, x,         luaUgetfieldltintgtL, index, y  codepre  pI dont believe that theres a way to use overloading to make this work in a generic way, and I cant use partial specialization. Is there any way to make it work in this casep

Negative 1080 pI have two ptimesn arrays codexcode and codemissxcode, where codexcode contains arbitrary numbers and codemissxcode is an array containing zeros and ones.

Things are a bit more complicated than that because not all items can be diffed.p  pWhat I would like to do is have a single selection capability intact but then also enable emonlyem CTRL  mouse click for second selection.  I tried using QAbstractItemViewExtendedSelection and then filtering out Shift and mouse drag but had no luck with that approach while I could capture Shift key with keyPressEvent I couldnt prevent selection I hoped just dropping the event would suffice as for drag I used mouseMoveEvent hoping to drop event when state changes to DragSelectingState but that didnt work either.p  pI then considered sticking with single selection but opening context menu on right click on the second item  while right click does emit  itemSelectionChanged signal, I havent figured out yet what to do with this since I dont know which item was rightclicked.p  pOpen to any other creative suggestions that do not involve adding additional UI elements  I cant have any extra buttons, combo boxes etc.p
Negative 1080 pMy hoster will stop supporting PHP 5.2 in a few weeks, which is why I have to switch to PHP 5.3. Im using Joomla 2.5 to manage the content of a site.

Negative 1080 pIve written a shell script running under CygWin, the purpose of which is to monitor a file for changes.  If the MD5 hash fails to match the previous hash, it will execute a command to process the file.  I used a 1second delay between checks of the hash.  This works great for several hours, but then gives an out of memory error and actually brings Windows 7 to its knees.p  pThe script uses a loop within a loop the outer loop is infinite by design, and the inner loop ends when it finds a nonmatching hash and processes the file.  It broke while running the inner loop, without the file having been modified at that point in time.  The file was modified numerous times previously, triggering the code below the inner loop, but not around the time when the memory error occurred.p  pI am just wondering why the loops here are consuming increasing amounts of memory over time.  Im assigning new MD5 values into existing variables over and over, not allocating new variables for each MD5 assignment.

I can provide the exact memory error if requested, but I would need some help to know which logs if any in CygWin to look at, to dig around and find the error text.  Id rather not run it all day to reproduce the error again.  The error was definitely something related to my CygWin shell running out of memory.  Thanksp  pIf you propose a solution which involves increasing the memory available to CygWin, that seems illogical, because the script is gradually increasing its own memory usage over time.  Thus, such a solution would only delay the inevitable, I think.p
Negative 1080 pI have a slight problem with BufferedImage and JPanel. I am creating a game with some 2d animation. p  pBasically i have an animationHandler that will loop through the pictures and depending on the rotation will also display it correctly. But the problem is  when I load in the pictures my Jpanel wont draw anything. It doesnt event matter if I comment out the custom paint methods  the paintComponent method wont draw anything and it seems like it skips the paintCompontent method. Even though the game doesnt crash and the timer still is running  it wont use the paintComponent method in an extended JPanel.p  pThe class that contains the timer  calls the JPanel throught JPanel.repaintp  pHere is the loadImg methodp  precode   Test method to check animationHandler and bufferedImgs   private void loadImages      BufferedImage b1     BufferedImage b2     BufferedImage b3     BufferedImage b4     BufferedImage b5      BufferedImage[] imgs  new BufferedImage[5]     try          b1  ImageIO.readnew Filewarlock1.png         b2  ImageIO.readnew Filewarlock2.png         b3  ImageIO.readnew Filewarlock3.png         b4  ImageIO.readnew Filewarlock4.png         b5  ImageIO.readnew Filewarlock5.png          imgs[0]  b1         imgs[1]  b2         imgs[2]  b3         imgs[3]  b4         imgs[4]  b5          animationHandler.addAnimationimgs      catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace       codepre  pCheersp

Negative 1080 pIm trying to pull a project from git, in particular, this one a hrefhttpsgithub.compocmoYaaic relnofollowhttpsgithub.compocmoYaaica.p  pIt is a library for IRC clients in android which I wanted to use to put an IRC client into an android app. As you can see from the root directory of this project there is no AndroidManifest.xml but there is a directory called application which does contain a manifest file. From this Im assuming that the application directory contains a sample Android app which demonstrates an IRC client the Yaaic app itself. However, when I import just the application directory as a project into Eclipse, it is filled with build path errors and results errors involving use of nonexisting stuff. I tried importing the entire directory I directly pulled from git hub as a project and there are still lots of build path problems.p  pAs for the project itself, Im not really sure whether its the source code for the Yaaic app or its the source code for a library or platform for use in other Android projects.

Negative 1080 pI have a Coolbar in VB6 which has has 6 Bands, each of these Bands has a Child of type Toolbar. The user can move these Bands around and set their visibility. I need to restore the settings when the software is restarted, but I am having some problems restoring the orderlocation I can restore the visibility and widths with no problems.p  pThe settings I am having problems restoring are Coolbar.BandsIndex.Position and Coolbar.BandsIndex.NewRow, as both of these properties are readonly.p  pI know I could save the Position and NewRow properties and then create each of the Bands at runtime instead of designtime, and then using the saved properties to determine the order in which to create the Bands. p  pI would prefer not to have to create the Bands at runtime but I suspect it may be the only way to restore these settings.

Before that, the error message is also missing.p  pWhen I install both in my local machine running XAMPP, which is Apache  PHP5, and point the configuration to my vps beanstalkd, it works. Further more, before configuration Beanstalkd console would display proper error message unlike when running on Nginx  PHP5FPM.p  pIve tried to use XDebug and didnt find any error or anything wrong when stepping through both web app. Both web app utilizing Zend Framework.

Negative 1080 pWorking on basic database design homework and ERD drawing in Visio, and cant wrap my head around this problem.  p  blockquote   pemUnited Helpers is a nonprofit organization that provides aid to people after natural disasters. Based on the following brief   description of operations, create the appropriate fully labeled Crows   Foot ERD.emp      pemIndividuals volunteer their time to carry out the tasks of the organization. The name, address, and telephone number for each   volunteer are tracked. Each volunteer may be assigned to several tasks   during the time that he or she is doing volunteer work, and some tasks   require many volunteers. It is possible for a volunteer to be in the   system without having been assigned a task yet. It is possible to have   tasks that no one has been assigned. When a volunteer is assigned to a   task, the system should track the start time and end time of that   assignment.emp      pemFor each task, there is a task code, task description, task type, and task status. For example, there may be a task with task code   101, a description of answer the telephone, a type of recurring,   and a status of ongoing. There could be another task with a code of   102, a description of prepare 5000 packages of basic medical   supplies, a type of packing, and a status of open.emp      pemFor all tasks of type packing, there is a packing list that specifies the contents of the packages. There are many different   packing lists to produce different packages, such as basic medical   packages, childcare packages, food packages, etc. Each packing list   has a packing list ID number, a packing list name, and a packing list   description, which describes the items that ideally go into making   that type of package. Every packing task is associated with only one   packing list. A packing list may not be associated with any tasks, or   may be associated with many tasks. Tasks that are not packing tasks   are not associated with any packing list.emp      pemPacking tasks result in the creation of packages. Each individual package of supplies that is produced by the organization is tracked.   Each package is assigned an ID number. The date the package was   created and the total weight of the package are recorded. A given   package is associated with only one task. Some tasks e.g., answer   the phones will not have produced any packages, while other tasks   e.g., prepare 5000 packages of basic medical supplies will be   associated with many packages.emp      pemThe packing list describes the ideal contents of each package, but it is not always possible to include the ideal number of each item.   Therefore, the actual items included in each package should be   tracked. A package can contain many different items, and a given item   can be used in many different packages.emp      pemFor each item that the organization provides, there is an item ID number, item description, item value, and item quantity on hand stored   in the system. Along with tracking the actual items that are placed in   each package, the quantity of each item placed in the package must be   tracked too. For example, a packing list may state that basic medical   packages should include 100 bandages, 4 bottles of iodine, and 4   bottles of hydrogen peroxide. However, because of the limited supply   of items, a given package may include only 10 bandages, 1 bottle of   iodine, and no hydrogen peroxide. The fact that this package includes   bandages and iodine needs to be recorded along with the quantity of   each that is included.It is possible for the organization to have   items donated that have not been included in any package yet, but   every package will contain at least one item.emp blockquote  pMy thought would be entity strongVOLUNTEERstrong amp strongTASKstrong creating the composite entity strongASSIGNMENTstrong which could generate the task strongPACKINGstrong.

Negative 1080 pIve got a UIViewController that Im using as a login view thats displayed modally above a UISplitViewController. Once the user has successfully logged in, the modal view is dismissed. The master view controller in the split view controller has a left bar button item to logging out. Once the logout button is tapped the login view controller is displayed modally again. If the user rotates the devices at this time, the modal login view is being dismissed. p  pI have no idea how to catch this. When setting a breakpoint on viewWillDissappear on the login view controller only system APIs are being called  nothing I wrote. p  pA sample app that reproduces the problem can be found here a hrefhttpd.prfc6oG relnofollowhttpd.prfc6oGap  pSteps to Reproduce Launch the attached app in portrait mode. Tap the login button. Tap the master button. Tap logout. Rotate the device left or right. The modal view dismisses.p  pExpected Results Launch the attached app in portrait mode. Tap the login button. Tap the master button. Tap logout. Rotate the device left or right. The modal view doesnt dismiss.p  pActual Results The modal view dismisses upon device rotation after completing the steps to reproduce above. p  pIve also filled a radar bug 12585564.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance p
Negative 1080 pMy goal is to write a function that will take a logical expression eg A OR NOTB AND C and convert that into disjunctive normal form. A OR NOT B OR NOT Cp  pI have written a grammar that will generate logical expressionsp  precodeS gt S S gt S S gt S op S S gt W op gt AND  OR W gt A  B  C  ...  Z codepre  pThis is my algorithmp  ol liGiven an expression Sli lirecursively parse the expression using the grammar above and build the corresponding parse treeli liConvert the expression to DNF by recursively simplifying any NOT operators on the tree.li liRecursively go through final parse tree and output the DNF logical expression.li ol  pWith a parse tree I can simplify NOT operators by checking the current nodes parent, and pushing it down the tree or rearranging the tree in the case of NOT NOT. Then it is trivial to flatten the tree.p  pThis works on paper, but now Im stuck with the actual parser. How can I convert these rules into a parser class I dont want to use external libraries and want to write the parser from scratch.p
Negative 1080 pIm writing a media player that will stream live and on demand streams.  Its mostly working, but for some reason I cant get seekToint working correctly.

Negative 1080 pI am doing a video editor in AS3 to cut, paste or append a part of the video. Just forget about appendadd part. I am not doing it yet.p  pWhat I have done so far is, 1. Load the video using URLStream, 2. Collect the bytes into a codebytearraycode while loading, 3. Provide it to the codeNetStreamcode object when click the codeplaycode buttonusing codeRESETBEGINcode as NetStreamAppendBytes.action, 4. Calculates the byte array position to trimcut a part of the video.p  pIt is working great when I trim the video from the last. The problem is when I try to do the same from the beginning or at somewhere of the video. If I am trying to trimcut the video from somewhere else other than beginning or end, calculates the start position to cut and number of bytes to cut, then cut the bytes from the bytearray. Everything is okay till this and when I traced the length of the array it returns the correct valuecalculated value subtracted from the total length before remove.p  pAn example can explain it better.p  pIf 1100000 is the total length of my bytearray. Start position to cut is 500000 and number of bytes to cut is 300000. So I removed the bytes from 500000 to 800000 from the byte array. When I try to play the video it only plays upto the start position where I started removing bytes. The last portion is not playing. I wonder why it is not playing, tried google but found nothing.p  pBut if try to trim from beginning, the video is not playing at all. I am not sure that there any workaround in video bytes. Appreciate any kind of help. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1080 pSO I have jQuery DataTables setup and running fine. My eventual goal, is to allow the user to use google places autocomplete, to update their location, and then to have a sortable distance column added to my DataTables table, upon refresh.p  pThe plan is is to have a button next to the text input of google autocomplete, that says use this address, once user searches for and finds an address using autocomplete, and then pushes the button , I want to probablysend them to a loading page for a few seconds whilst wep  p1read the text string, format it for use with google geo coding api, akap  pCranbourne, Victoria, Australia         CranbourneVictoriaAustraliap  p2insert it in a geocode requestp  p3extract the lat and lon values from the resulting json, and assign them to varsp  pNow comes the hard part, I was thinking using some php, to calculate the distance between the userslat,long, and every entry that was in the DataTable table, which was was populated with sql data using a foreign key all sql rows have lat lon data p  pThen I was thinking of sending said entries to an xml, only this time every entry will have an extra value DISTANCE.p  pOf coarse with some clever code this whole thing wont take a second,  the new DataTable table is then populated with the xml, only this time it contains a distance column  with distance values for every row, which of coarse will be sortable, without any DataTables hacks what so ever.p  pSo am I stupid, or is this somewhat of a good idea, is there an easier wayp  pI would really like some answers to this thank you.p

Negative 1080 pNuances DragonMobile component apparently turns off VoiceOver announcements between the initial call to codeSKRecognizercodes codeinitWithTypedetectionlanguagedelegatecode and the components call to coderecognizerDidFinishRecordingcode. It makes some sense that they do this, since they dont want the VoiceOver announcements to be picked up by the mic and transcribed.p  pThe problem is that theres usually a 12 second gap between the initialization of the recognizer and the initial call to coderecognizerDidBeginRecordingcode. In order to prevent the users first few words from getting cut out of the transcription, its necessary to use coderecognizerDidBeginRecordingcode to indicate to the user that they should start speaking i.e. you cant just have them hit the mic button and start speaking immediately.p  pMy problem is that since DragonMobile turns off VoiceOver as soon as codeinitWithTypecode is called, I have no way of indicating to a VoiceOver user that they should begin talking at the appropriate time.p

The complexity comes from the type of input that the codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode generates. The codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode uses the codePlacesAutoCompletecode from Google, therefore I am working with an inputs like emJamal, Kathmandu, Central Region, Nepalem and maybe emKalanki, Kathmandu, Central Region, Nepalem. What I would want the codeTableLayoutcode to reflect is strongResults From ... To ...strong p  pMy question is how can I just take in the first part of the string in emJamal, Kathmandu, Central Region, Nepalem which is just emJamalem for the codeTableLayoutcode to display a the results like strongResults From Jamal to Kalankistrong. Being very new to android I sort of have a vague idea, the code that I tried looks like this.p  precodeString[] from String[] to pulling the auto complete text view from   location.getString.toText to  destination.getString.toText referencing the text view inside the table layout results.setTextnew StringBuilder.appendResults fromfrom[0].append toto[0] codepre  pThis code obviously does not work as it prompts me to change codefromcode to a codeStringcode.

Negative 1080 pIn my MVC view model, I have a table, inside a form. p  pFrom my javascript, Im invoking my controller as follows p  precode.ajax              type POST,         url Url.ActionReorderClues, Clues, Model,         data JSON.stringifypositions,         contentTypeapplicationjson      codepre  pAnd my controller signature is as follows p  precodepublic ActionResult ReorderCluesTreasureHuntDetails treasureHuntDetails, int[] ids codepre  pWhat I find is that when the javascript invokes the controller in this way, the data model the TreasureHuntDetails object is populated with only the treasureHuntId, and everything else is null. The second parameter, the ids array populates successfully  this is the one that I use JSON.stringify on in the ajax function. p  pI cant figure out why everything else is null apart from the treasureHuntId. In the form, I have a HiddenFor line for every property of the object, like this p  precode        Html.HiddenForm gt m.CompletionMessage         Html.HiddenForm gt m.Description         Html.HiddenForm gt m.Clues         Html.HiddenForm gt m.Leaderboard         Html.HiddenForm gt m.TreasureHuntId         etc. codepre  pI dont see whats special about the TreasureHuntId variable that it is the only one whose value is the only populated one on the object which reaches the controller. Any ideas What could I be doing wrong p  pWhen I invoke the controller the normal way with just the data model TreasureHuntDetails, everything gets populated properly, so its only in the javascript where Im also adding on the Ids array the positions variable in the javascript code snippet is an integer array. p

Negative 1080 pUsing Entity Framework, I have created an application which is able to read data from the database it was modeled against.  I now have another database, with the same tables, hosted on another server.p  pThe problem is that the tables on the second database belong to a schema with a different name to the original, so simply changing the connection string for my context in the app.config file doesnt work. I get the error table or view does not exist.  There must be some mapping somewhere in the auto generated code stating the original schema name.p  pWhat is the correct way to handle this kind of situation I dont really want to have to remodel the second database as it is identical to the first. I cant change the databases as other applications would stop working.p  pAny nudge in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1080 pSo Im trying to make a simple little database in C for fun.  I want to do it using arrays.  But I keep getting errors though.

Negative 1080 pI am learning how to use JSP, and servlets using Tomcat 7, and I just learned about Tomcats web manager. I altered my tomcatusers.xml file appropriately to create a username and password. Tomcat is using port 8080, and when I use the following URL in Chromep  precodehttplocalhost8080managerhtml codepre  pI get Tomcats 404 File cannot be found message. All of the files that I should be able to open in my webapps folder which the manager files are also located in also return 404 errors.p  pThe strange thing about this is that, in Eclipse, I have a project called testapp which I imported from a file I downloaded off one of my tutorials, and when I type inp  precodehttplocalhost8080testapp codepre  pthe correct page is served.p  pI found this really strange because, if anything, I would think my own project would not work and the manager would. Im uncertain how Tomcat knows how to access the webapps directory by default, so any explanation that also explains how this works would be excellent. I had been teaching myself using these files a month ago and all the webapps files were being correctly served, but now they are not.p  pOn a different note, but possibly related, when I copy a .WAR file into my webapps directory and restart the Tomcat 7 server, the .WAR does not automatically unpack itself. When I was working on learning JSP a month ago and I copied a .WAR file into the webapps directory, it did correctly unpack. Is there a command I need to enter or a configuration file I need to change in order to get this to happenp

Negative 1080 pIve been reading a lot about why global variables are bad and why they should not be used. And yet most of the commonly used programming languages support globals in some way.p  pSo my question is what is the reason global variables are still needed, do they offer some unique and irreplaceable advantage that cannot be implemented alternatively Are there any benefits to global addressing compared to user specified custom indirection to retrieve an object out of its local scopep  pAs far as I understand, in modern programming languages, global addressing comes with the same performance penalty as calculating every offset from a memory address, whether it is an offset from the beginning of the global user memory or an offset from a codethiscode or any other pointer. So in terms of performance, the user can fake globals in the narrow cases they are needed using common pointer indirection without losing performance to real global variables. So what else Are global variables really neededp

Also, there are 2 more dropdowns whose list of values depends on the master dropdown.p  pI have thought of the following approaches 1. Making a AJAX call and displaying the 12 fields through AJAX.

Having a hidden div containing all the dependent fields and using AJAX to return the values of the fields.

Slightly modified code belowp  precodefunction       Note lastTime is defined up here.     var lastTime  0      var vendors  [ms, moz, webkit, o]      Okay, so theyre trying to set window.rAF to the appropriate thing based on browser     forvar x  0 x lt vendors.length ampamp window.requestAnimationFrame x          window.requestAnimationFrame  window[vendors[x]RequestAnimationFrame]         window.cancelRequestAnimationFrame  window[vendors[x]           CancelRequestAnimationFrame]           ...and if that doesnt work, turn it into a setTimeout     if window.requestAnimationFrame         window.requestAnimationFrame  functioncallback, element               I guess this is a way to make sure that the wait time             between renders is consistent              var currTime  new Date.getTime             var timeToCall  Math.max0, 16  currTime  lastTime             var id  window.setTimeoutfunction  callbackcurrTime  timeToCall ,                timeToCall              lastTime  currTime  timeToCall              Wait. They just assigned lastTime a value.             Why is this going to persist between calls to window.rAF             The variable lastTime was defined inside this function, not in the window.              return id               if window.cancelAnimationFrame         window.cancelAnimationFrame  functionid              clearTimeoutid           codepre  pMy guess is it has something to do with the function being placed inside parentheses, but how What does this accomplish and what other effects can I expect with this coding style Is this something I should start using more regularly, and if so, whenp

Negative 1080 pI am flash developer and I want to create an application for iphone ios. For that reason I have registered on developer.apple.com, bought developer license, created mobileprovision and .p12 files.Also, in adobe flash I created usual layer and compiled as followed as a target, I chose ios air 3,6. Also, I linked it with mobileprovision and .p12 files and I made compilation ipa file for ios. Also, with USB cable I connected my iphone operating system 7.0.2 to computer and with the help of itunes I installed ipa file created by me.  After that I tried to run my app on iphone, but below aplication icon instead of application name it is written installing ..., but after I am restarting iphone, it is written waiting. I know that there are other alternative programming languages for creating ios applications, but I am flash developer and I want to create iphone applications with adobe flash. Other apk files created with adobe flash work on android operating system without any problem.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comX2tmQL9 relnofollowhttpimgur.comX2tmQL9ap

But this receiver never receives the intents, so i am unable to set codelocationRequestcode timings, based on which I will pass the appropriate codelocationRequestcode to the services. p  pCan any body tell and help why is the broadcast reciever in the codeonCreatecode of services might not be getting called.

Negative 1080 pI have a web application that is built on symfony 1.4 framework. Im making nearly 10 DB calls per http request. I found that to process the request, it takes nearly 600800ms on the server itself. When I put log statements to track the time spent in making DB calls, I found that it is less than 20 of total time. I then found that most of the time is being spent on converting the db resultset to PHP objects. The time taken for a select query is of the order of tens of ms but time spent in deserializing this resultset is around 89 times more. Any suggestions on how to optimize this p  pAs of now I can think of adding APC so that interpreting entire php code for every request can be avoided. I also found from few links that autoloading for every request in symfony causes slowness. Any other ways of optimizingp

Negative 1080 pMy code needs some help from professional xcoders p  pI have a draggable uitextview called headline that is a subview in mainstage. I also added a pinch gesture to change the fontsize inside the uitextview. Everything works fine but the last essential feature that I really need is the rotation of the uitextview.p  pSo I added a uislider for rotation and volia it also works. But after this transformation the uitextview goes crazy when it becomes a new size via the pinch gesture. The position and size of the uitextviewp  pAfter some research in the documentation I found some useful warning framep  blockquote   pIf you want the drawRect method invoked when the frame rectangle

Negative 1080 pI recently stumbled upon a little problem.p  pPart of an algorithm I was working on needed to find codencode consecutive numbers in a sorted list of numbers.p  pSo, for example, the list would look something like thisp  precode1 2 2 3 4 5 5 5 6 7 8 9 9 9 9 codepre  pGiven that list and N, the amount of consecutive duplicates, the algorithm needed to find the first number in the smallest group of exactly N consecutive numbers. So for example with N  2 and the given list, the algorithm should find 2. With N  3 it should pass the group of 2s, find the group of 5s instead since its the smallest group of 3 consecutive duplicates in that list. It shouldnt return 9 since there are actually 4 consecutive 9s and with N  3 we are looking for the smallest group of strongexactlystrong 3 consecutives.p  pI did in the end cobble together some peace of crap code that did the job, but I was wondering how would some experienced programmer do this.

Negative 1080 pIm using DBUnit during integration tests for mocking data for a legacy SpringHibernate project Ive inherited. Unfortunately a long while ago someone decided that it would be nice to have a user table called user, which is a reserved keyword in our DB. This was then solved by renaming the entity table mapping to user which now has been living on for ages.p  pAs Ive now a couple years later started to incorporate integration testing this presents a problem as DBUnit does not allow  characters in its xml dataset files it is XML you know... and the CSV reader would require the file to be called user.csv which seems to fail under my OS.p  pIs there any way to add this table without using either XML or CSV readers of DBUnit, or should I tacke this problem from another angle One alternative would be to i.e. use another  mapping during integration tests so that I could name the table to its intended name user. But I dont know whether that is doable or not.p  pIve been fighting this for 2 days now so Id love some external feedback.p  pSo, just to clarify. I have an entity such asp  precodeEntity name  user Inheritancestrategy  InheritanceType.SINGLETABLE Auditable public class User implements UserDetails, Serializable    properties etc.... codepre  pDuring my integration tests hibernate takes care of creating this an other tables by configuration of the persistence.xml file. When dbunit then tries to populate the data I get errors due to missing table irregardless of how I try to escape the user table name.p
Negative 1080 pI have a graph of the dependencies of all tasks, and the costs of each task. Now I want to calculate a scheduling for a given amount of CPUs. Ive found many papers on scheduling algorithms, optimal schedulers seem to be too expensive for my problem size around 100 nodes as its an NPhard problem. Id settle for a heuristic, preferably one that has a bound how close it gets to the optimum. My problem now is do I really have to code it myself This should have been solved many times before, it can be easily applied to project management, maybe there something existsp  pIf you happen to know a library in python thatd be perfect or the next best thing would be C, otherwise id settle for anything else.p

Negative 1080 pI have around 30 million unique IDs stored in a database. In addition, I have some logic defined on my local machine which uses these unique IDs to generate a description for these IDs. p  pUsing Solr, I want to index the description and store the IDs so that when a user searches for the description keywords, he is returned the unique IDsp  pI came across the DataImportHandler, and from what I infer, I cant use it since my data from the database needs to be transformed before indexing.p  pThe other problem is that my database is singlethreaded, so I dont want to keep a connection open for a long time since that would put other users queries on hold.p  pMy current approach is that, I retrieve 1000 records, transform them and batch index them using SolrJ. This takes 5 hours to index the entire data.p  pIs there a better approachp

Negative 1080 pFirst, Id to state that Ive been searching for a solution for this problem for three days now, that may means either Im not asking the right question or not using a good approach. If any, please guide me in the right direction.p  pThis is the scenario Ive an codeActivitycode and a bound codeServicecode. The codeServicecode holds some data and processes it as necessary while posting a persistent ongoing notification with some information. The codeActivitycode has three codeFragmentscode inside a codeViewPagercode that displays the data processed by the codeServicecode.p  pThe codeFragmentscode are a strongList Fragmentstrong, that shows the active data entries available, a strongDetails Fragmentstrong that displays the details for each data and a strongParameters Fragmentstrong where the user can modify how the data is processed.p  p[Service] lt [Activity]  [ViewPager[List], [Details], [Parameters]]p  pEverything works just fine. My codeActivitycode binds to the codeServicecode, the codeViewPagercode is created after and then the codeFragmentscode fetch information trough an codeInterfacecode.p  pHere comes the fun part... Screen Rotationp  pAs the codeServicecode binds asynchronously, when the user rotates the screen the codeFragmentscode no longer have the data because the codeActivitycode is bounding the service while theyre already present and not recreated thanks to the codeViewPagercode.p  pIve been trying to figure this out but it seems that I dont have the knowledge to solve it. Ive tried making static references to the fragments, setting them up before the service is rebound but I cant get a stable solution.p  pId be using codeandroidconfigChangescode in my manifest but there are different layouts for each orientation.p  pAgain, if Im using a bad approach, please, guide mep

Negative 1080 pI am trying to generate a heatmap of a 10x10 matrix. All values in the matrix are probabilities sum of all elements equal to 1.0. I decided to use the matshow plot type it seemed easy to use, however I cannot generate the output Id like to have so far.p  p1.Visually it looks kinda ugly. Would you recommend a fitting color map for use in a heatmapp  p2.Is there a way to assign predefined bins to the color map when using matshow E.g. take a gradient of 1000 colors, always use the same colors for the corresponding probabilities. In default behavior, I think matshow checks the minimum and maximum values, assigned the first and last colors in the gradient to those values, then colorizes the values in between by interpolation.p  pSometimes I have very similar probabilities in the matrix, and other times the range of probabilities may be great. Due to the default behavior I tried to explain above, I get similar plots, which makes comparisons harder.p  pMy code for generating the said heat maps and an example plot is below by the way.p  pThanksp  precodeimport bumpy as np  def pickcoord    i  np.random.randint0,10    j  np.random.randint0,10    return [i,j]  board  np.zeros10,10 for i in range1000000      try         direction  np.random.randint0,2         newboard  np.zeros10,10         coords  pickcoord          if direction  1             for k in range2                 newboard[coords[0]][coords[1]k]  1         else             for k in range2                 newboard[coords[0]k][coords[1]]  1      except IndexError         newboard  np.zeros10,10      board  board  newboard  boardprob  boardnp.sumboard  figurefigsize6,6 matshowboardprob, cmapcm.Spectralr, interpolationnone plt.xticksnp.arange0.5,10.5, [] plt.yticksnp.arange0.5,10.5, [] plt.grid codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtd1si.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1080 pI am almost done coding my app, but I still have a problem that I couldnt solve for weeks...I browsed on this site and other websites on the same issue, but I couldnt find a way to solve it. I have a table view with cells like Instagram with images downloaded from the server. My problem is when I scroll the table view, its not smooth and it blinks. p  pTo construct the table view, I do the followingp  pthe header views and the cells are subclassed. I download all the images async and cache them afterwards about 25Ko each in the tmp folder of my app.  each image downloaded has the same frame as the UIImageView in which it should be placed. I tried to save the images in png and jpeg format, but the problem remains.p  pI did another test where instead of putting the downloaded images inside the cells, I put an image inside my app with any scaling. In that case, the table view scrolls smoothly. p  pSo I suspect maybe the problem is with the way I cache the images and get them from the cache. But even in this case, I tried to cache the images using NSCache and a temporary folder, but no result...p  pHere is my codep  precodevoidCacheTheImageDownloaded NSData TheImageData  NSStringPathOfImage     NSFileHandle fout    [[NSFileManager defaultManager] createFileAtPathPathOfImage contentsNil   attributesNil]    fout  [NSFileHandle fileHandleForWritingAtPathPathOfImage]    [fout writeDataTheImageData ]    [fout closeFile]     UIImageGetTheImageFromTemporaryDirectoryNSStringImagePath    UIImage theCachedImage    theCachedImage  [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFileImagePath]    return theCachedImage    voidGetImageForTheViewedCell NSString ImageName  NSStringTheImageURL     NSIntegertherow  UIImageViewMyImageView     NSString TheKey  [NSString stringWithFormatld, longtherow]   NSString tmpDir  NSTemporaryDirectory   NSString ImageDownloadedTmpDir   ImageDownloadedTmpDir  [tmpDir stringByAppendingPathComponentTMPImagesDownloaded]    NSMutableString TheImagePath  [NSMutableString stringWithStringImageDownloadedTmpDir]   [TheImagePath appendString]   [TheImagePath appendStringImageName ]  if  [self VerifyIfImageIsAlreadyCachedTheImagePath]     MyImageView.image  [self GetTheImageFromTemporaryDirectoryTheImagePath]  else     NSBlockOperation loadImageIntoCellOp  [[NSBlockOperation alloc] init]     [loadImageIntoCellOp addExecutionBlockvoid         dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0,               NSURL theURL  [NSURL URLWithStringTheImageURL]             NSData data1  [NSData dataWithContentsOfURLtheURL ]             NSData data  UIImagePNGRepresentation[UIImage imageWithDatadata1]             dispatchsyncdispatchgetmainqueue,                  MyImageView.image  [UIImage imageWithDatadata]                 NSBlockOperation ongoingDownloadOperation        [self.TheImageDownloadOperations objectForKeyTheKey]                 if ongoingDownloadOperation                      [self.TheImageDownloadOperations removeObjectForKeyTheKey]                                  [self CacheTheImageDownloadeddata TheImagePath]                           ]      if TheKey          [self.TheImageDownloadOperations setObjectloadImageIntoCellOp forKeyTheKey]           if loadImageIntoCellOp          [self.imageLoadingOperationQueue addOperationloadImageIntoCellOp]           codepre  pI am working on Xcode 5.02.p  pThanks for your suggestionsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is my code for CellForRowAtIndexpathp  precodeUITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath     static NSString cellIdentifier  myCustomCell  MyCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercellIdentifier]  if cell  nil      cell  [[MyCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifiercellIdentifier]   [cell.contentView.subviews makeObjectsPerformSelectorselectorremoveFromSuperview]  NSInteger row  indexPath.row cell.tag  row   The Profile picture NSString theurl  self.myProfilePics[row] NSString TheImageName  self.TheImageNames[row] [self GetImageForTheViewedCellTheImageNametheurlrow cell.ProfilePicView]  getting image from the cache or downloaded async [cell.TheProfilePicButton setBackgroundImagecell.ProfilePicView.image forStateUIControlStateNormal] [cell.contentView addSubview cell.TheProfilePicButton]  Username NSString myusername  self.Usernames[row] [cell.UsernameButton setTitle myusername forStateUIControlStateNormal] [cell.contentView addSubviewcell.UsernameButton]  date NSString mydate   self.Dates[row] [cell.DateLabel setText mydate] [cell.contentView addSubview cell.DateLabel]  return cell   codepre

Negative 1080 pI am trying to put an UIImageView into the UIView of my ViewController, an resize UIImageView automatically when the UIView is either 480px or 568px height. But it seems incredibly complex in IBp  pIf i put a normal view inside my View controller, it will resize naturally. But with my UIImageView it doesnt. Even if I choose the scaleToFill Mode. Nothing will happen.p  pSo it seems I need to use constrains. But the problem is when I add a simple constraint just to tell the UIImageView to be X height size. IB tell me there are errors, and ask me to add lots of constraints to other component of the view. Thats propagating and I am finishing with thousands of constraints. This is confusing, since I just want to make my UIView resize to the Parent container and for IB to tell me I need to add a constraint to other components who never ask nothing.p  pIn code it take only two lines I dont understand why its so complex in IB. So could someone please explain me how to make my UIImageView resize according to his parent p  pI have made lot of research in Google, and found nothing that helped me. It is like nobody never has to use full imageView mode.p  pNote that I have already succeed with constraint for a full UIImageView in another viewController, but this is kind of obscure. But now I dont know why when I do the same things, IB want to add lot of lot of lot of constraints.p
Negative 1080 pHaving trouble with this expression in my controller. Im working on an MVC 4 project, and I have some audit records coming back, along with a list of applications that has been filtered per user, and per what apps are in their audit history. Im adding filtering to the audit log by using a drop down list, that uses an ajax call to a method that reruns the audit log with the appid of the selected item in the dropdown list against the audit records, and returns only audit records that contain that matching appid. Having a problem with the expression to get it to filter though. Here is what I have right nowp  pThe method Im using to accomplish thisp  precode    [HttpPost]     public ActionResult GetRowsString username, int page, int appId               User user  UserManager.GetUserusername         var filteredApps  UserManager.GetUserAppListFromAuditRecorduser         ListltApplicationListViewgt appList  filteredApps.SelectMapper.DynamicMapltApplicationListViewgt.ToList         ListltSelectListItemgt appsList  appList.SelectappItem gt new SelectListItem                      Text  appItem.Name,             Value  appItem.ID.ToString         .ToList         ViewData[UserAppList]  appsList         SearchInfo searchInfo  new SearchInfo  UserName  username          var auditRecord  userHelper.GetAuditInfosearchInfo, page         var filteredRows  auditRecord.AuditRecords.Wherea gt a.ApplicationID  appList.Selectt gt t.ID.ToList         return PartialViewauditRecord       codepre  pBest to inform you that the filtering of the applist per user is done on the backend when the call to the db is made. thats why its being mapped to the viewmodel, and then stuffed into a selectlist. The part im having trouble with is the filteredRows variable. Im trying to compare the auditrecords with the appid from the select list and return filtered results. Thanksp

Negative 1080 pFirst of all, I am using EF 6.0 with Code First approach.

Negative 1080 pI have been reading up on Windows WF and how to create and execute rules outside of Workflows. However all the examples seem to require a defined class in which to bind the rules to properties. p  pWe have a scenario where an arbitrary list of properties and values is defined at runtime, and we want to execute rules against a KeyValuePair or Dictionary containing these values. If the value is not there, the rule should fail or ignore it.p  pSo for example, say we had rules to recommend moviesp  ul liRule 1 If Genre  Thought Provoking and Rating  5 then set Movie  Enemy Mineli liRule 2 If Genre  Scary and Rating  5 then set Movie  Aliensli liRule 3 If Genre  Comedy and Rating  2 then set Movie  Dumb and Dumber    li liRule 4 If Genre  Comedy and Snack  Caviar then set Movie  Bigli ul  pIf our dictionary contains this list of properties and valuesp  precodeRating  5 Genre  Thought Provoking  Movie   codepre  pThis would execute codeRule 1code and the Movie value would get set to Enemy Minep  pHowever, if our dictionary contains this list of properties and valuesp  precodeSnack  Caviar Genre  Comedy  Movie   codepre  pThis would execute codeRule 4code and the Movie value would get set to Bigp  pAfter reading all the discussions and blogs on WF rules, I am unable to see if it is even possible to process rules without a concrete object.

Negative 1080 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commEu8O.png altenter image description herep  pHow to customize TabControl TextBox should be aligned to the right and it should be on the same line with tab items. TextBox is also a filter for each tab item content and it should save its state during the tabs switching e.g. if we enter 123 into the TextBox when TabItem1 has been selected, then we select TabItem2 and enter abc, now when we select TabItem1 again, TextBox should contains 123. Or it is better not to use TabControl element in this casep

Negative 1080 pI have a form in my page which has a panel grid inside of it, to show different info. One of the first rows is a breadcrum that shows a tail of selected items at a current moment. I want to define an ajax event for selecting an item and updating that breadcrum and other components of my page as well. The problem is that I get a Unable to attach  to nonClientBehaviorHolder parent error. I searched that this is because PanelGrid Columns which is the parent component of that breadcrum doesnt support ajax events, the suggestion was to implement a Data Table, the problem is that  i have lots of different components such as Menus, SelectOneMenu, Command Buttons, Graphic Images, etc. that wont render in a DataTable.

Negative 1080 pI have a project Im working on that is making movies from a simulation. The simulation is passed from another program that defines the projection matrix. p  pThe issue I am running into is that the other program has a sort of fake orthographic view, what I mean by this is that its projection matrix is as follows p  precodePerspectiveMatrix  glmperspective3.5, 1, 1.0f, 50.0f  codepre  pAnd it uses the LookAt functionp  precodeViewMatrix  glmlookAt     2000,3000,2000,  eye      0,0,0,  center      0,0,1up   codepre  pSo what I mean by fake orthographic view is that they have positioned the camera far enough away and small angle to zoom the scene that the view lines for lack of a better term are almost parallel like in a real orthographic projection. p  pSo this is all fine and well but what Ive run into, and is an issue in the other program as well, is that all of the high precision depth testing is close to the camera and in my case this is empty space. This means that there is quite a lot of z fighting as shown in the link belowp  pnbspnbspimg srchttps28.postimg.orgdjeorsm2ldepth.png altScreenshotp  pSo my question is what ways can I change my depth testing in order to maybe bias the buffer towards the far plane or something along those lines. I have tried moving the NearPlane farther out, which has the result of zooming out the screen, so I compensate with a narrower angle in the perspective. But doing this enough times makes the problem worse, there isnt z fighting but it doesnt draw things at the right depth. The spheres end up on top of everything.p  pI did find some info at Outerra a hrefhttpouterra.blogspot.com201211maximizingdepthbufferrangeand.html relnofollowhttpouterra.blogspot.com201211maximizingdepthbufferrangeand.htmla They had some ideas for reversing the depth buffer but it was Nvidia specific and I need to be compatible with both ATI and Nvidiap

Negative 1080 pHello and thanks for taking a look at my issue.p  pI have been migrating my SPA application to use the Durandal 2.0 library, following the sage advice from my oft savior, a hrefhttpwww.johnpapa.netupgradingdurandaltoversion20 relnofollowJohn Papaa. And now that I have completed the upgrade process, I find a strange behavior or a lack of behavior when I try to navigate using my menu buttons. Specifically what isnt happening is the browser doesnt redirect to the new page. The interesting thing is that the browser address bar is populated properly and if I simply click in the address bar and press enter hard reload, I am redirected as expected.p  pIve looked around and this is not caused due to any security checkredirect which I have seen other discussing elsewhere. Durandal code is unmodified.p  pjs on pages can be quite trivialp  precodedefine[], function       console.logwelcome loaded     var vm             title Welcome           return vm  codepre  pSo my guess is its something in my configuration of durandal.p  pmain.jsp  precode    require.config     paths          text ..Scriptstext,         durandal ..Scriptsdurandal,         plugins ..Scriptsdurandalplugins,         transitions ..Scriptsdurandaltransitions,         knockout ..Scriptsknockout2.3.0,         bootstrap ..Scriptsbootstrap,         jquery ..Scriptsjquery1.9.1     ,     shim          bootstrap              deps [jquery],             exports jQuery                 definejquery, function   return jQuery  defineknockout, ko  define[durandalsystem, durandalapp, durandalviewLocator],     function system, app, viewLocator        Enable debug message to show in the console          system.debugtrue      app.configurePlugins         router true,         dialog true,         widget true           app.start.thenfunction           toastr.options.positionClass  toastbottomright         toastr.options.backgroundpositionClass  toastbottomright           When finding a viewmodel module, replace the viewmodel string           with view to find it partner view.         viewLocator.useConvention           Adapt to touch devices          app.adaptToDevice         Show the app by setting the root view model for our application.         app.setRootviewmodelsshell, entrance       codepre  pshell.jsp  precodedefine[....Scriptsdurandalpluginsrouter, viewmodelsconfig, servicesdatacontext], function router, config, datacontext       function addSessionitem          router.navigateitem.hash           function boot              .pagesplashmessage.textConfiguring routes...         router.makeRelative moduleId viewmodels          router.mapconfig.routes         router.buildNavigationModel         .pagesplashmessage.textLets make traxx..          return router.activate           function failedInitializationerror          var msg  App initialization failed   error.message           return          addSession addSession,         adminRoutes adminRoutes,         profileRoutes profileRoutes,         visitorRoutes visitorRoutes,         router router,          activate function               datacontext.primeEditData.thenboot.failfailedInitialization                codepre  proutes in config.jsp  precodedefine[....Scriptsdurandalpluginsrouter], function router          toastr.options.timeOut  4000         toastr.options.positionClass  toastbottomright         var startModule  Welcome         var serviceName  apiZepher         var imageSettings               imageBasePath ..contentimagesphotos,             unknownPersonImageSource unknownperson.jpg               var routes  [          route , moduleId homewelcome, title Welcome, nav false, ,          route Welcome, moduleId homewelcome, title Welcome, nav false, ,          route NotFound, moduleId homenotFound, title Not Found, nav false, ,          route Roadmap, moduleId homeroadmap, title Roadmap, nav false, ,          route Register, moduleId accountregister, title Register, nav true, caption lti classfa fausergtltigt Register ,          route RegisterAccounts, moduleId accountregisterAccounts, title Register Accounts, nav false, caption lti classfa fakeygtltigt Register Accounts, ,      ]         return          debugEnabled ko.observabletrue,         imageSettings imageSettings,         servicetitle serviceName,         startModule startModule,         router router,         routes routes,         activate function               console.logconfig activate called             router.makeRelativemoduleId viewmodels              router.maproutes              router.buildNavigationModel               sets up conventional mapping for              unrecognized routes              router.mapUnknownRouteshomenontFound, notfound               activates the router              return router.activate               no longer needs a start module                codepre

Negative 1080 pIn my Rails app I have a manytomany relationship between 2 models codeTeachercode and codeCoursecode through a join table.

This would be easy to do if this was a onetomany relationship, but with a manytomany relationship, we need to save the codecoursecode before we can associate it with codeteacherscode.p  pMy initial plan was to override Rails codecreatecode method in the codeCoursecode model to allow passing codeteacheridscode and validate presence of at least one codeteacheridcode before saving the codecoursecode, but Im not sure this is a nice approach.p

Negative 1080 pIm knee deep in my second Firemonkey app for Windows and OSX and slowly converting my library of functions to handle cross platform issues. I am trying to create a generic SelectDirectory function that will run platform specific code for Windows or OSX. I have SelectDirectory working great for both platforms called individually, but the Windows specific one requires a hwndparent handle to run.p  pThis is being run in a IFDEF MSWINDOWS directive just as the OSX one is in its compiler directive. How can I pass a generic handle to this function or how can I reference Application.MainForm or something that can be cast into a Windows handle inside this function I am hoping to avoid using Firemonkey specific units in the uses clause of this library. I would rather pass in a THandle somehow and cast it into a TWindowHandle inside the function, but after an hour of working on it, I dont see how to do it without compromising the usefulness of my library.p  pAny help appreciated.p

Negative 1080 pI dont really know how to handle versioning on an eclipse project integrated with maven and Bamboo.  Ive seen several maven plugins that may be helpful  p  ul liversionsmavenpluginli litychoversionsli limavenreleasepluginli libuildhelpermavenpluginli limavenantrunplugin for if  elseli limavenscmpluginli ul  pI have several modules in the project and I would like to have a different version for each eclipse manifest and references and maven pom.xml project, but with valid qualifiers. I know that this can be accomplished by parsing the pom version with the tycho versioning plugin. My project has been configured so that whenever I do a push, the changes are saved in my stash repository and this automatically triggers bamboo to start the build and deployment. p  pI would like to have a version with this format  major.minor.fixes.vTimestampBambooBuild. In order to that I think that I could trigger different build plans that execute different maven profiles in bamboo by pushing branches with keywords like feature or bugfix to increment the minor or the fix part, respectively.p  pMy questions arep  ul lihow do I tell maven to track commited classes I thought about scmstatus and then change the versions on the projects that have had modifications. For this I had thought of using a profile for versioning in master pom.xml thats activated if commited classes follow the pattern of the associated artifactId, which would change in every submodule. li lihow do I autoincrement properties I was thinking about extracting the parts of the version with parseversion goal in the buildhelper plugin but I woudnt know how to actually increment it. There are goals in the versions plugin but how do I tell the plugin to increment just the minor.version or just the fix.version and update that property. Concerning the build part I can pass a bamboo variable.li liIf I trigger all of this by commiting I would have to do a commit afterwards to refresh my repository but that would trigger the build again.. maybe I could add a condition on the activation of the profile to skip the whole build if classes the only commited classes are classes that contain the versions manifest.mf, pom.xml, etc.. li licould git tag make things simplerli ul

Negative 1080 pIve just updated from Prism 4.1 to 5 and code that used to work fine now throws InvalidOperationExceptions. I suspect that the root cause is that the updated async DelegateCommands dont marshall to the UI thread properly.p  pI need to be able to call command.RaiseCanExecuteChanged from any thread and for that to raise the CanExecuteChanged event on the UI thread. The Prism documentation says that thats what the RaiseCanExecuteChanged method is supposed to do. However, with the Prism 5 update, that no longer works.

Negative 1080 pI had a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26040358gulpdifferentpipecollectionswithinsametaskcoffeescriptandjavascriptherea that has merged into a bit more research on my part and a new way this could work.p  pBasically Im trying to have all of my code.jscode and code.coffeecode files within one codegulp.srccode object and based on the extension, do relevant tasks. p  pWhat started off with a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.orgpackagegulpif relnofollowgulpifa has turned into me using a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.orgpackagegulpfilter relnofollowgulpfiltera which I prefer honestly. The catch Im running into right now is getting this all to work with a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.orgpackagegulpsourcemaps relnofollowgulpsourcemapsa. The current task seems to override the other  but Id ultimately like everything to be concatenated in one file, sourcemapped in another and have each file extension run its respective tasks. Youll see the uglify task is commented out as thats what keeps yelling at me without a whole bunch to go off of. When I do get the filters to work and I have a CoffeeScript error, I noticed that codecoffeescriptlintcode will do its job, but then my watch command while still running, doesnt respond to anything.p  pIt seems like I might be going down the path of extracting each sourcemap using something like a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.orgpackagegulpextractsourcemap relnofollowgulpextractsourcemapa, but am not sure if thats the right way to go.p  pNormally Id separate out the JS and Coffeescript task, but I have so many things comingling between the two that bringing them together with a simple filter seemed logical  especially as Im trying to figure out the sourcemaps for both.p  pI feel like this one is pretty close, so any nudges in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1080 pIve started using RQ  Redis to build out some asynchronous execution of some long running jobs for my django site. Im hoping to do something like the followingp  ul lipI want one queue for each instance of a model. You can think of this model like an api user account.there will not be a lot of these. 15  20 at mostpli lipI will be distributing batches of tasks anywhere from 10  500 evenly across the queues. Multiple batches may be added before the first batch completes.pli lipWith each batch, I would like to start up a worker for each queue that is not actively being worked on, and I would like to run these workers in batch mode, so that once they run out of tasks they will shut down.pli lipI realize I could just not run them in batch mode, and then I would always be working on  listening for work on all of the queues. The problem with this is that I would like to be able to add and remove queues dynamically, so its better if it starts up the available queues with each batch.pli ul  pI realize it might seem odd that Im distributing tasks across the queues, but the reason for this is that each task in the same queue must be rate limited  throttled according to a service Im using think of it as an API rate limit, but where each queue represents a different account. But for my purposes it makes no difference which account the task is running on, so I might as well parallelize across all the accounts.p  pThe problem that I am facing is that if I start a worker and give it a queue that is already being worked on, I now have two workers operating independently on that queue and so my expected throttling rate gets cut in half. How can I only start a worker if there is not already a worker operating on that queue I could probably find a hacky solution to this, but I would prefer to handle it the right way and since I dont have much experience with queues I thought I should ask. p  pI am already implementing my own worker class so that I can dynamically control the queues, so I just need a way to add logic where if that queue is already being worked on, it will not be given a new worker. A simple version of my worker is herep  precode customworker.py import sys from Api.models import  from rq import Queue, Connection, Worker   importing the necessary namespace for the tasks to run from tasks import    dynamically getting the queue names in which I am expecting tasks queues  [user.name for user in ApiUser.objects.all]  with Connection      qs  listmapQueue, queues or [Queue]      w  Workerqs      w.workburstTrue codepre

To do that, I use jQuery to hide the imagep  precodeimg.hide codepre  pAnd then I create a canvas and put it in the same div with id codedrawingcode in the html. I then set the background of the canvas to be the same as the img src for the image I hid. This makes it look like an image but now it is actually a canvas with the image as its background. I do this byp  precodedrawing gt canvas.cssbackgroundimage,url.image img.attrsrc context.canvas.width  img.width context.canvas.height  img.height codepre  pThe issue I am having is that sometimes, the image isnt displayed in the canvas and the canvas is not the size of the image. I think its probably because of some loading issue. How can I wait for the canvas to have the image displayed in the background for sure Thank youp  pEdit Note that in the DOM, the canvas always has the right src. It just doesnt display itp  pEdit 2 Heres the JSfiddle. Here, everything seems fine but I have a lot more going on in my code including fetching stuff from the server so its slower there.

Negative 1080 pfor a study on genetic programming, I would like to implement an evolutionary system on basis of llvm and apply codemutations possibly on IR level.p  pI found a hrefhttpeschulte.github.iollvmmutatellvmmutatea which is quite useful executing point mutations. As far as I have understood, the instructions get countnumbered, one can then e.g. delete a numbered instruction.p  pHowever, introduction of new instructions seems to be possible as one of the availeable statements in the code. Real mutation however would allow to insert any of the allowed IR instructions, irrespective of it beeing used in the code to be mutated. In addition, it should be possible to insert library function calls of linked libraries not used in the current code, but possibly available, because the lib has been linked in clang.p  pDid I overlook this in the llvmmutate or is it really not possible so farp  pAre there any projects trying to already have implemented such mutations for llvmp  pllvm has lots of code analysis tools which should allow the implementation of the afore mentioned approach. llvm is huge, so Im a bit disoriented. Any hints which tools could be helpful e.g. getting  a list of available library functions etc.p  pThanks Alexp

Negative 1080 pThis seems quite a basic question so apologies if this has been asked before please point me in the direction of any useful resources.p  pSo I have a RESTful service to retrieve some data. However, the RESTful service requires a certain amount of data in order to do the retrieval. This data could be roughly summed up as user context data  information about the user whether stored by the calling application or previously retrieved from another application which the service needs to use to action the retrieval.p  pSince REST works semantically, the correct verb HTTP method to retrieve something is a GET request. Most example GET requests I have seen only use small amounts of data, and the data is passed on the URL. However once we get into the realm of services which require larger amounts of data to make the retrieval, it seems wrong to put all that information in the URL. Not only that, but there are known limits to URL length enforced by certain components often 255 characters or so, IIRC.p  pSeemingly the options available arep  ul liUse POST to send the data in the request body. However, this is not semantic since we are not asking the service to update anything, only retrieve.li liPut the larger portion of information in my case, the user context into an HTTP header. However, this feels wrong as headers should be used for headers, not data.li liMake multiple requests to send the data in multiple URLs. However this seems to break the stateless goal, as the service would have to maintain some kind of state to tie the requests together.li liWrite the data to a database and then pass the service a key to retrieve the data from there. However this would result in the request not being selfcontained and also introduce performance bottlenecks.li ul  pIs there another option Whats the best practice herep

Negative 1080 pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecodeimport feedparser  d  feedparser.parsehttprss.cnn.comrssedition.rss, etagd.etag codepre  pI am new to Python and cant get my head around the parameter codeetagd.etagcode I Dont understand the data type. Its important to me because I am trying to make this parameter as a string dynamically. Does not work. I printed codetyped.etagcode, result is Unicode. So I tried to the Unicode func to form my string. Still no luck. Sorry, I realise this is so basic, I just cant get it. I know, to get the etag working is easy to achieve if you follow the examples from the feedparser site, where you do your first call without a param, then each subsequent call use the codeetagd.etagcode. I am mainly learning on my iPad and am using Pythonista, so I am running my program over and over. I also know I could write it out to a file, and parse the file instead, but I really want to understand why I cant dynamically create this param. I am sure I will hit the same problem with another module sooner or later.p

Negative 1080 pI will try to explain my problem and hopefully someone can point out my mistake. I am trying to create a database in SQLAlchemy using the models.py code below. I have this database created from before and was using it with some success until I tried hashing the password field. When I do this the password field disappears and no query will work as it returns a user.password column does not exist. So I deleted the database and when to start from scratch by creating it again. But when I try to create it again I get a table does not exist error. I think these two errors may be related and hopefully curing one will cure both. The code I am using to create the database is below please help me find what is causing the issues.

Negative 1080 pOn one side I have a Windows service that uses Entity Framework to connect to a SQL Server instance and work with a database there. p  pOn the other side I have a WIX based installer which has a bootstrapper .NET based GUI in which the user can enter connection details to be used in the connection string by the service. In this installer GUI I am also performing a check on the user provided data and check the database connection using SqlConnection.Open and even creatingdropping a database.p  pThe issue appears in a workgroup environment, no domain controller present, and when the user chooses Integrated Security as an option. The bootstrapper application successfully connects to the SQL server and performs some operations with it, but then the Windows service fails to connect to the SQL server using Integrated Security. If I follow up by changing that to user and password authentication, the service works correctly. p  pIs there any way to have the bootstrapper fail connection if the service would fail, or the other way aroundp  pThanks.p

Negative 1080 pI ma developing an app with SteroidsSupersonic using Parse as backend and I am struggling to make object relationships work. Here an example. I have one class Course and one class Teacher with a one to one relationship each Course one Teacher. What I would like to do is to display all the courses with the associated teacher. To set up the relationship in Parse I have used a column type Pointer to the other class. Below the code in the controllerp  precodeCourse.findAll.then function courses          scope.apply function             scope.courses courses            for i  0 i lt scope.courses.length i             look for the teacher          Teacher.findscope.courses[i].Teacher.objectId.then function teacher              scope.apply function                 scope.courses[i].Teacher teacher                                                        codepre  pThe problem of the above code is that the variable i is not defined inside the Teacher.find function so I cannot assign the teacher object to the correct course object. I even tried to use a specific variable in the scope to manage the index as in this other codep  precodeCourse.findAll.then function courses          scope.apply function             scope.courses courses           scope.index  0           for i  0 i lt scope.courses.length i             look for the teacher          Teacher.findscope.courses[i].Teacher.objectId.then function teacher              scope.apply function                 scope.courses[scope.index].Teacher teacher               scope.index  scope.index  1                                                        codepre  pThe problem of this second code is that randomly a teacher is linked to the wrong course maybe because the function find is called asynchronous so the two variables i and index are not always synchronized.p  pI believe the problem I am facing is more related to the asynchronous behavior of angularjs but I dont really know how to solve it.

Negative 1080 pI come from a CC background and Im having real trouble trying to wrap my head around the syntax of node.js. Anyway, I found some code online to explain the difference between blocking and nonblocking code, and its had me stumped for hours. Ive tried searching and reading books but just cant find an answer to this. The example code retrieves a user ID from a database.p  pstrongBlocking Versionstrongp  precodefunction getUserid     var user  db.queryid    return user   console.logName   getUser432.name codepre  pstrongNonBlocking Version Node.jsstrongp  precodefunction getUserid, callback     db.queryid, callback   getUser432, function user     console.loguser.name  codepre  pIm fine with the Blocking version because in that instance, the user ID is assigned to the variable codeusercode. What I just cant seem to understand is the codeusercode argument in the anonymous function. It seems that codeusercode just appears out of nowhere and then has instructions acted upon it, without any relationship to an existing variable. p  pHow does the program know what codeusercode is How does it even make any connection with the users ID I honestly cant tell if its my lack of knowledge of JavaScriptNode, or whether the person who wrote this code didnt bother to complete it. All I know is, this makes no sense in CC. p

Negative 1080 pI am trying to create a database API and I am using Python 2.7 and SQLAlchemy. p  p The API has to support multiple database platforms including MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. p  p The problem with making it multiplatform, is that each database has a slightly different understanding of the word schema. Basically, if I am connected to a MSSQL database I want to include or set the schema, but if I am connecting to a SQLite database I do not.p  p  Another problem is that I am using the declarativebase within SQLAlchemy, and the classes have been created, with the schema specification, before I know what type of database I am connecting to. The user will connect to the database after the script has started running. So I dont know what type of schema to assign the table.p  p Here is a simplified example of my code p  precodefrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarativebase Base  declarativebase class MethodsBase     tablename  methods     tableargs  uschema sname      MethodID  Columnmethodid, Integer, primarykeyTrue, nullableFalse     MethodTypeCV  Columnmethodtypecv, nullableFalse, indexTrue     MethodCode  Columnmethodcode, String50, nullableFalse     MethodName  Columnmethodname, String255, nullableFalse     MethodDescription  Columnmethoddescription, String500     MethodLink  Columnmethodlink, String255     OrganizationID  Columnorganizationid, Integer codepre  pI have tried a lot of things, including, setting the schema after the class is created but that doesnt work.I have also tried to use reflection but I cant figure out how to get it to work with the declarative base.  p  pIs there a way to use reflection or a global variable or something to be able to change the schema at runtime, once I have a connection to the database and know what the schema will bep

Negative 1080 pI have app which performs some lightweight migration when updating the coredata model.p  pHowever, I want to perform some specific actions after the migration has occurred as a oneoff operation.p  pFor example, I have two NSManagedObjects... strongemDocumentemstrong and strongemDocumentLayoutemstrong.  At the moment, there is no relationship between strongemDocumentemstrong and strongemDocumentLayoutemstrong except by the app looking for a strongemdocumentNameemstrong matching a strongemlayoutNameemstrong in the respective objects. p  pThis is inefficient, so I want to create a true coredata relationship between the two and then after the migration has occurred, link the two objects by iterating through and creating the relationships.p  pI have looked at code such as ...p  precodeNSManagedObjectModel destinationModel  [persistentStoreCoordinator managedObjectModel] BOOL pscCompatibile  [destinationModel isConfigurationnil compatibleWithStoreMetadatasourceMetadata] codepre  p... to check if migration is required and do respective work but I need this to be a oneoff operation as there may, during the lifetime of the app, be documents stored in strongemDocumentemstrong which do not require a relationship with strongemDocumentLayoutemstrong and therefore if this operation runs each time an update is made to the datamodel, a relationship will be created which is not what is required.p  pSo, I could look at say a versionNumber flag in the app which detects this and only runs the operation once and prevents it running each time but this seems nonelegant and errorprone. p  pSo, is there a way to run an operation once after a specific migration, then never run againp

Negative 1080 pIm Trying to sync the Core Data of my app with icloud, but Im experimenting some weird behavior with it. When I made only one change moc.save in the first device and let the second device get the change, it works fine, but when I make several changes in the first device, then the second device doesnt get all the changes, just some of the new or deleted records. I suspect that all the changes are actually received on the second device, but for some weird reason they merge partially with the core data. I know that because if I delete the app on the second device, strongturn off the wifistrong, and reinstall the app, then all the changes magically appears. So I believe that the codepersistentStorecode data codeNSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentNameKeycode or something persists in the device even if you delete the app. I confirm that by doing this turning the wifi off, then delete the app a message prompt that the local data will delete, but not in the icloud bla bla bla..., with the wifi still off install the app again and open it, wait two or three seconds, and there it is, all the data I had before deleting the app. The only way to get rid of that data is deleting it from the icloud drive and wait for the device to get the instruction to delete it.br Another way to force the new data changes appear when it doesnt sync properly, when the app is running, is by removing the persistentStore and adding it again, then all the new changes appears now, that is actually my solution. So the changes do really reach the second device, but for some reason they dont merge completely with the local core data.p  pI follow the notifications and the messages, when it syncs correctly is likep  pstrong20150818 182621.074 MyApp[1082101691] mergeChanges notifNSConcreteNotification 0x170059920 name  com.apple.coredata.ubiquity.importer.didfinishimport object   userInfo       deleted  n     inserted  n    0xd0000000103c001a n     updated  n strong p  pBut when it doesnt, I get a ton of random messages like offendingOperation  import What is that and so, and some other random errors likep  pstrong45[PFUbiquityFilePresenter processPendingURLs]blockinvoke439 CoreData Ubiquity  Librarian returned a serious error for starting downloads Error DomainBRCloudDocsErrorDomain Code5 The operation couldnt be completed. BRCloudDocsErrorDomain error 5  No document at URLstrong  p  pemWhen this error comes, is when it syncs partially.em  p  pI notice that I get a notification from codeNSPersistentStoreDidImportUbiquitousContentChangesNotificationcode in the second device, for each change I made in the first device, but when the error comes it stops receiving the notifications from the current changes. I can made more changes after that and they eventually syncs , but the data becomes inconsistent between devices and that sucks... p  pSo, because it is always the same problem when do several changes in one device, I use the following code when codeapplicationDidBecomeActivecode to remove the persistent store firstp  precodevar storeCoordinatorNSPersistentStoreCoordinator  persistentStoreCoordinator         var storeNSPersistentStore  storeCoordinator.persistentStores[0] as NSPersistentStore         var storeURLNSURL  store.URL         storeCoordinator.removePersistentStorestore, error nil         NSFileManager.defaultManager.removeItemAtPathstoreURL.path, error nil codepre  pstrongthen add it again withstrongp  precode  managedObjectModel            The managed object model for the application.

Negative 1080 pI started with c a few weeks ago, so Im not pretty well in this programming language, but I need it for work. now I have the following problem I want to send and receive data from a Serial port in a Loop some voltages in a loop like 200ms the whole time. during the time the Loop is running, which should be all the time,  cant use my GUI to sendreceive other data from that Serial port.  I tried a timer already, which executes the Loop every 200ms, but if I pressed another button in the GUI to send data to the Serial port, something went wrong. What I want to do now is to check at the end of the Loop if a button was pressed, then stop the Loop for a moment, execute the function of the button and then restart the Loop. Any ideas how I can manage this  thx in advanceIp  pPart of the Loopp  precodeserialPort1.WriteGetVolt 8Vr serialPort1.ReadLine tb12V8VV.Text  serialPort1.ReadLine serialPort1.WriteGetVolt 5V3r serialPort1.ReadLine tb5V3V.Text  serialPort1.ReadLine serialPort1.WriteGetVolt 3V5r serialPort1.ReadLine tb3V53V3V.Text  serialPort1.ReadLine codepre  pand a buttonp  precodetry      serialPort1.WriteLineSetVolt 8V Onr     serialPort1.ReadLine     serialPort1.ReadLine     btn8VOff.Visible  true     btn8VOn.Visible  false     btn12VOff.Visible  false     btn12VOn.Visible  true  catch TimeoutException      errorMessage  codepre

Negative 1080 pEnvironment Im using Sun Java JDK 1.8.060 on 64bit Windows 7, using Spring Integration 4.1.6 which internally appears to use Apache Commons Net 3.3 for FTPS access.p  pIm attempting to integrate with our application an automatic download from our clients FTPS server. Ive done so successfully with SFTP servers using Spring Integration without any trouble for other clients without issues, but this is the first time a client has required us to use FTPS, and getting it to connect has been very puzzling. While in my real application Im configuring Spring Integration using XML beans, to try to understand whats not working Im using the following test code though Im anonymizing the actual hostusernamepassword herep  precodefinal DefaultFtpsSessionFactory sessionFactory  new DefaultFtpsSessionFactory sessionFactory.setHostXXXXXXXXX sessionFactory.setPort990 sessionFactory.setUsernameXXXXXXX sessionFactory.setPasswordXXXXXXX sessionFactory.setClientMode2 sessionFactory.setFileType2 sessionFactory.setUseClientModetrue sessionFactory.setImplicittrue sessionFactory.setTrustManagerTrustManagerUtils.getAcceptAllTrustManager sessionFactory.setProtP sessionFactory.setProtocolTLSv1.2 sessionFactory.setProtocolsnew String[]TLSv1.2 sessionFactory.setSessionCreationtrue sessionFactory.setCipherSuitesnew String[]TLSECDHERSAWITHAES128GCMSHA256  final FtpSession session  sessionFactory.getSession try      final FTPFile[] ftpFiles  session.list     logger.debugFtpFiles , Object[] ftpFiles  catch Exception ignored   session.close codepre  pIm running this code with codeDjavax.net.debugallcode to get all the TLS debugging information printed.p  pThe main control connection to the FTPS server works fine, but when it tries to open the data connection for the list or any other data connection Ive tried, I get a codejavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException Remote host closed connection during handshakecode, caused by codejava.io.EOFException SSL peer shut down incorrectlycode. If I uncomment the swallowingexceptions catch block around the codesession.listcode command, then I can see though the javax.net.debug output that the server sent the following message after rejecting the data connection SSL handshake p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodemain, READ TLSv1.2 Application Data, length  129 Padded plaintext after DECRYPTION  len  105 0000 34 35 30 20 54 4C 53 20   73 65 73 73 69 6F 6E 20  450 TLS session  0010 6F 66 20 64 61 74 61 20   63 6F 6E 6E 65 63 74 69  of data connecti 0020 6F 6E 20 68 61 73 20 6E   6F 74 20 72 65 73 75 6D  on has not resum 0030 65 64 20 6F 72 20 74 68   65 20 73 65 73 73 69 6F  ed or the sessio 0040 6E 20 64 6F 65 73 20 6E   6F 74 20 6D 61 74 63 68  n does not match 0050 20 74 68 65 20 63 6F 6E   74 72 6F 6C 20 63 6F 6E   the control con 0060 6E 65 63 74 69 6F 6E 0D   0A                       nection.. codepre  pWhat appears to be happening and this is my first time dealing with FTPS, though Ive dealt with plain FTP before is that the way the server ensures authentication and encryption over both the control and data connections is that after a normal TLS connection to establish the control connection and authentication happens there, each data connection requires the client to connect with the same TLS session. This makes sense to me as how its supposed to be work, but the Apache Commons Net FTPS implementation doesnt seem to be doing that. It seems to be trying to establish a new TLS session, and so the server is rejecting the attempt.p  pBased on a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comq1060506265839this question about resuming SSL sessions in JSSEa, it appears that Java assumes or requires a different session for each hostpost combination. My hypothesis is that since the FTPS data connection is on a different port than the control connection, its not finding the existing session and is trying to establish a new one, so the connection fails.p  pI see three main possibilitiesp  ol liThe server is not following the FTPS standard in requiring the same TLS session on the data port as on the control port. I can connect to the server fine using the same hostuserpassword as Im trying to use in my code using FileZilla 3.13.1. The server identifies itself as FileZilla Server 0.9.53 beta upon login, so perhaps this is some sort of proprietary FileZilla way of doing things, and theres something odd I need to do to convince Java to use the same TLS session.li liThe Apache Commons Net client doesnt actually follow the FTPS standard, and only allows some subset that doesnt allow for securing the data connections. This would seem odd, as it appears to be the standard way of connecting to FTPS from within Java.li liIm completely missing something and misdiagnosing this.li ol  pId appreciate any direction you can provide as to how to connect to this kind of FTPS server. Thank you.p
Negative 1080 pIm studying IP classes and the topic of subnetting is confusing me. Im doing some practice questions and the question Im stuck on requires me to find number of addresses under each subnet. What I have so far is, a block 211.17.180.024 from which I was able to obtain subnet mask 24  255.255.255.0. And that theres 32 subnets. Im not too sure how to proceed from this point. Normally, I would say theres 254 usable addresses excluding 211.17.180.0 and 211.17.180.255 but Im not sure how to deal with 32 subnets.p  pOk, I may have figured out how to solve this problem Since there are 32 subnets, I multiply by 2, getting 64 addressesmultiply because there are 2 unusable address per every subnet Then, 25664192326, so, there are 6 addresses per every subnet in this block. Im not sure if this is the right way to solve this problem, some confirmation would be really appreciatedp

My instinct was to move it to the Droppables over event, but that only fires once, when the draggable first moves over the droppable.p  pIs there any way to have my Droppable trigger an event when the draggable over it movesp  pFor a code example, my old draggable said...p  precode.myDraggable.draggable   drag functione, ui      x  e.pageX     y  e.pageY     doTheThingx, y     codepre  pand ideally my new droppable would say strongNOTE this does not work, there is no overUpdate methodstrongp  precode.myDroppable.droppable   overUpdate functione, ui      x  e.pageX     y  e.pageY     doTheThingx, y     codepre  pAny suggestions on how to go about this properly Surprised I cant find an answer, I would have thought this would be welldocumented.p  pThanksp

Negative 1080 pUsing Delphi XE3, I created a lookup field obtaining a float value from another client dataset. When presenting the value of this lookup field, if the value has not decimal digits, the value is not presented, otherwise, if the value has decimal digits, the value is presented. I have already checked everything that can interfere such as masks, attributes. There is no reason for that. Is that a problem of Delphi I ask this question because I use the same resource in Delphi XE and no problem occurs.p
