Positive 4545 pI have a very big source code, say 2000 classes. I make different executables.ipa using the source code. The changes among the executables are some keys in the info.plist file and the product name. p  pWhenever I change the product name Xcode compiles all the source files2000 again. If I dont change the product name and change only the info.pilst file it compiles only the info.plist file which indicates that I do not have any weird things in the source code.p  pI dont want the files to be compiled again and again as it takes long time, an incremental compile with a different product name is really nice to have. p  pIs there anyway I can achieve it. Or is there a key like codeCFBundleNamecode that controls the name displayed under the app icon without making the Xcode compile again. Changing only codeCFBundleNamecode doesnt make the Xcode to recompile however it is not changing the bundle name unless the project is cleaned. UPDATE Touching the info.plist make it work .p

Positive 4545 pI run some scenario which involves message exchanges between different binaries. I changed some code introducing some global variables and compiled. One of the binary failed. So I added a static library in that binary. The reason to add was say X.c contained use of global variables but whose reference were in some other file say Y.c. X.o was used in making this binary but not Y.o. So I added the static library which contained Y.o.  The problem I faced now is that the complete set up which involves this binary as well doesnt provide the desired output as it used to earlier in the same scenario. When I replace the impacted binary with the old binary keeping other binaries new, the scenario is successfully executed. What could be the possible issuep  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 4545 pI cant seem to retrieve the AlternateView from System.Net.Mail.AlternateView.p  pI have an application that is pulling email via POP3.  I understand how to create an alternate view for sending, but how does one select the alternate view when looking at the email.  Ive have the received email as a System.Net.MailMessage object so I can easily pull out the body, encoding, subject line, etc.  I can see the AlternateViews, that is, I can see that the count is 2 but want to extract something other than the HTML that is currently returned when I request the body.p  pHope this makes some amount of sense and that someone can shed some light on this.  In the end, Im looking to pull the plaintext out, instead of the HTML and would rather not parse it myself.p

Negative 4545 pIm involved on a project to make a survey system.  Weve been hammering out the logic for a few question types, and I could use a second opinion on what is the best way to proceed.  We work on a ASP.NET 2.0 website using VBVS2005 with an Oracle database.p  pIn our oracle server, we plan for some tables to organize our data.  Theres a table for our surveys, one for questions keys determine which survey it goes on, one for answers again, keys determine what question it belongs to, and one for answer collection.  Most questions only return one response, and thats pretty easy to figure out.  However, when we start thinking about items that return multiple answers, it starts to get tricky.p  pFor example, if we have a simple matrix of 3x3 filled with check boxes.  The rows are days Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  The columns are activities like Biking, Running, Driving.  The user checks each one they did for a given day, thus each row can have more than one response.  Another one we want to think about is what if instead of checkboxes, we have textboxes where users write in a value of how many minutes they spent on an activity.p  pSo far, for collecting responses, I like the idea of a hrefhttpaspnet.4guysfromrolla.comarticles0814021.2.aspx relnofollowtraversing a list of controlsa in the form and keeping tabs on the kinds of controls that collect data.  Since the controls are created in code, usually theyre given an ID of a string with a number affixed to the end to keep track of what question type it is, and what number it is.p  pQuestion 1 Should the data returned from the user be in a single database entry with delimiters to separate each answer, or should each answer get its own entryp  pQuestion 2 Whats the best way to identify what response goes with what answer on the surveyp
Negative 4545 pI am developing this website for a client. It was working fine till a couple of days ago on all major browsers. p  pSince yesterday I have been facing this unusual problemp  pIn IE7, whenever I click on any link on the page navigation link or anything else, the IE7 window minimizes. When I restore the window, the proper linkthe new page is open and showing. Also, this occurs only if I have one IE7 tab open, i.e if suppose I have two tabs on the window then it works perfectly. p  pAlso, this works fine on IE6 and Firefox. Firebug shows no errors of any kind when I am loading the same page in Firefox. p  pCan anyone think of a reason that this could be happeningp

Negative 4545 pi am using a single instance of Bugzilla for issue tracking in multiple projects. Some of my projects are restricted to be visible only to a single group of people while other projects have to be readyonly for everybody even if they do not have a user account in bugzilla. Submitting bugs should always only be possible for authenticated users. Editing bugs is also restricted only to a small group of people and the bug reporter himself.p  pDoes somebody know how i have to set permissions in bugzilla if i want to make a single project readonly for all users without logging in At the moment you can only view bugs if you have logged in.p  pstrongUpdatestrong As sereda described requirelogin is turned off.

Negative 4545 pId like to set up a staging server for a Rails app. I use git amp github, Cap, and have a VPS with ApachePassenger. Im curious as to the best practices for a staging setup, as far as both the configuration of the staging server as well as the processes for interacting with it. I do know it should be as identical to the production server as possible, but restricting public access to it will limit that, so tips on securing it only for my use would also be great.p  pAnother specific question would be whether I could just create a virtual host on the VPS, so that the staging server could reside alongside the production one. I have a feeling there may be reasons to avoid this, though.p
Negative 4545 pI am trying to use StructureMap and have essentially 3 levels of abstraction.  I have a service a repository and database interface.  So the IService depends on IRepo and IRepo depends on IDatabase.  My issue is that my IDatabase concrete type takes in db connection information. I am going to create these on the fly, trying to use ObjectFactory.Configure.  p  pSo I have a user and the user is linked to a company and the I lookup the company connection information and I want to create the proper IDatabase concrete type based on this information.  I have the concrete type configured in my startup code. I only want to use the IService object from outside...so I want to create a named IService object named with the company Name.  Having issues with trying to create these types on the fly.  ANY information would be helpfull...p  pI basically want to be able to create a named instance and either set properties or pass specific args to a constructor at runtime, without knowing the concrete type.  I have the concrete type setup in the config file.  I have tried to use the ObjectFactory.GetInstance and tried to set properties inside the Configure method, but got StackOverflow exception...HOW IRONICp
Negative 4545 pI need to automatically match product names cameras, laptops, tvs etc that come from different sources to a canonical name in the database.p  pFor example strongCanon PowerShot a20ISstrong, strongNEW powershot A20 IS from Canonstrong and strongDigital Camera Canon PS A20ISstrong  should all match strongCanon PowerShot A20 ISstrong. Ive worked with levenshtein distance with some added heuristics removing obvious common words, assigning higher cost to number changes etc, which works to some extent, but not well enough unfortunately.p  pThe main problem is that even singleletter changes in relevant keywords can make a huge difference, but its not easy to detect which are the relevant keywords. Consider for example three product namesbr  strongLenovo T400strongbr  strongLenovo R400strongbr  strongNew Lenovo T400, Core 2 Duostrongbr  The first two are ridiculously similar strings by any standard ok, soundex might help to disinguish the T and R in this case, but the names might as well be 400T and 400R, the first and the third are quite far from each other as strings, but are the same product.p  pObviously, the matching algorithm cannot be a 100 precise, my goal is to automatically match around 80 of the names with a high confidence.p  pAny ideas or references is much appreciatedp

Negative 4545 pHow can I use ROLLBACK TRANS inside a SQL Server trigger without getting the standard message p  pMsg 3609, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 The transaction ended in the trigger. The batch has been aborted.p  pThis is being returned to the client. I would like the ROLLBACK to complete silently. I need to achieve this within the trigger only i.e. no c or .NET code changes to capture the error messagge.p  pLet me add that this is a dirty workaround to a recently added functionality. When we added the new functionality the client didnt like it. Rather then do an emergency release of the codebase we just killed the update inside the trigger.

Negative 4545 pIm working on an wpf app which contains a listview with quite a lot of data 10 000 to 100 000 rows.

Negative 4545 pWe are getting the following error on a certain database occasionally under moderate load.p  ph3iSystem.InvalidOperationException Timeout expired.

We will fix those pieces of code in our next release but to solve the current production issue, I am suggesting increasing the max pool size to 300. The max concurrent users we are currently experiencing is around 110 which is obviously over the default pool size 100. p  pI am also suggesting making sure all our connection strings to a particular SQL Server instance are identical to avoid creating multiple connection pools unnecessarily.

Negative 4545 pI inherited a legacy Perl script from an old server which is being removed.  The script needs to be implemented on a new server.  Ive got it on the new server.p  pThe script is pretty simple it connects via expect amp ssh to network devices and gathers data.  For debugging purposes, Im only working with the portion that gathers a list of the interfaces from the device.p  pThe script on the new server always shows me a page within about 5 seconds of reloading it.  Rarely, it includes the list of interfaces from the remote device.  Most commonly, it contains all the HTML elements except the list of interfaces.  p  pNow, on the old server, sometimes the script would take 20 seconds to output the data.  That was fine.  p  pBased on this, it seems that apache on the new server is displaying the data before the Perl script has finished returning its data, though that could certainly be incorrect.p  pstrongAdditional Informationstrong Unfortunately I cannot post any code  work policy. However, Im pretty sure its not a problem with expect. The expect portions are written as expect or dieerror msg and I do not see the error messages. However, if I set the expect timeout to 0, then I do see the error messages.p  pThe expect timeout value used in the script normally is 20 seconds ... but as I mentioned above, apache displays the static content from the script after about 5 seconds, and 95 of the time does not display the content that should retrieved from expect. Additionally, the script writes the expect content to a file on the drive  even when the page does not display it.p

Negative 4545 pIm trying to figure out the best way to handle pinch gestures in a UITextView.  Currently Ive been trying to handle it all in the UITextView, but Im getting inconsistant results.  It seems that it can catch my touches in the touches began method, but it doesnt always get caught in the touches moved method.p  pWould it be better to handle the touches in a View, and have the UITextView pass on the multitouch events  Would it be better to do something tricky like placing the UITextView in a scrollviewp  pAt this point all Id like to do is adjust the font size on a multitouch pinch or expand, which I can get to work, but it isnt consistant and I think Ive managed to just confuse the UITextView more than actually get results.p  pMy control is a subclass of UITextView and implements UITextViewDelegatep  precodeimport MyUITextView.h implementation MyUITextView   skipping unimportant code    voidtouchesBeganNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      if[touches count]  2              NSLogtwo touches         UITouch first  [[touches allObjects] objectAtIndex0]         UITouch second  [[touches allObjects] objectAtIndex1]         initialDistance  [self distanceBetweenTwoPoints[first locationInViewself] toPoint[second locationInViewself]]          voidtouchesMovedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      NSLogtouches moved     if[touches count]  2              self.scrollEnabled  NO         UITouch first   [[touches allObjects] objectAtIndex0]         UITouch second  [[touches allObjects] objectAtIndex1]         CGFloat currentDistance  [self distanceBetweenTwoPoints[first locationInViewself] toPoint[second locationInViewself]]         ifinitialDistance  0             initialDistance  currentDistance         else ifcurrentDistance gt initialDistance                      NSLogzoom in             self.scrollEnabled  YES             self.font  [UIFont fontWithName[self.font fontName] size[self.font pointSize]  1.0f]             self.text  self.text                  else ifcurrentDistance lt initialDistance                      NSLogzoom out             self.scrollEnabled  YES             self.font  [UIFont fontWithName[self.font fontName] size[self.font pointSize]  1.0f]             self.text  self.text                     voidtouchesEndedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event      NSLogtouches ended.     initialDistance  0     [super touchesEndedtouches withEventevent]    CGFloatdistanceBetweenTwoPointsCGPointfromPoint toPointCGPointtoPoint      float x  toPoint.x  fromPoint.x     float y  toPoint.y  fromPoint.y     return sqrtxx  yy    BOOLcanBecomeFirstResponder    return NO  codepre  pBasically Ive tried to disable the scrolling when I have two touches on the screen, and then reenable it when I was done.

And In my opinion, some memory space is allocated to a thread as its Stack when it starts to run, while the heap is shared by all the threads within a process.

The integrations could be in the form of cells containing something like [cexport.csv]rawdataA3 Where export.csv is the csv file exported from the time registration applications. Can you see a better way to integrate against all these applications It should be mentioned that almost all our customers have Microsoft Office.p  hr  pEdit Answers to the excellent questions from Pontus Gaggep  pemHow similar are the data in the different applicationsem I assume that since they time registration applications, they will have some similarities, but I assume that some will register the how long time one has worked in total for a whole month, while others will spesify for each day. If Excel is chosen, I believe that many of the differences could be ironed out using basic formulas.p  pemWhat quality is the dataem The quality of the data can vary so basic validation must be undertaken, a good way is also to make it transparent for the customers, how our application understands their input, so they are responsible.p  pemHow large amounts of data are you talking aboutem There will be information about the time worked for up to 50 employees.p  pemIs the integration oneway onlyem Yesp  pemWith what frequency should information be transferredem Once per month when they need to pay salaries.p  pemHow often do the applications themselves change, and how often does your product changeem If their application is a homebrewed Excel sheet, then I assume it will change once a year due for example a mistake someone. If it is a standard proper time registration application, then I do not believe they are updated more often than every fifth year or so, as it is a very stabile concept.p  pemShould the integration be fully automatic or can your end users trigger a data transferem They can surely trigger data transfer. The users are often dedicated to the process so they can be trained at doing it, which means that they could make up to, say 30, mouse clicks in order to integrate each month.p  pemWill the customers have somebody to monitor the integrationsem As we have many customers, many of them should be able to undertake the integration themselves. We will though be able to assist them over the telephone. We cannot, though undertake the integration ourselves because we would then be responsible for any errors due to user mistakes, etc.p  pemDoes the phrase integration spaghetti mean anything to you...em I am looking for ideas from the best chefs to cook a nice large portion of that. p

Negative 4545 pI am trying to recreate the nice textured buttons like Finder, Safari and Transmission have in  their toolbar. First I started by just dragging in a Texture button in the IB and such.

I have remove alles code and delegates from the toolbar to make sure it is not a code issue.p  pThen, just to make sure, I created a new project no code at all and I can reproduce the issue with a clean NSWindow with a NSToolbar with one NSToolbarItem with a NSButton in it.p  pAdding the NSButtons via code likep  precode NSArraytoolbarAllowedItemIdentifiersNSToolbartoolbar      return [NSArray arrayWithObjectmyToolbarMenu]    NSArraytoolbarDefaultItemIdentifiersNSToolbartoolbar      return [self toolbarAllowedItemIdentifierstoolbar]    NSToolbarItemtoolbarNSToolbartoolbar     itemForItemIdentifierNSStringstr willBeInsertedIntoToolbarBOOLflag      if [str isEqualToStringmyToolbarItem]  YES          NSToolbarItem item  [[NSToolbarItem alloc] initWithItemIdentifierstr]         [item setView[[NSButton alloc] init]]          [item setMinSizeNSMakeSize50,50]         [item setMaxSizeNSMakeSize50,50]         [item setLabelText]         return [item autorelease]            return nil  codepre  pBut this also has the same effect when I press a NSToolbarItem with a NSButton in it in Text only mode the toolbar itself forces its mode to Icon and Text.p  pDo you have any idea how I can make it work correctly or perhaps have an alternative to creating the nice looking toolbaritems like Safari etc havep

Negative 4545 pWhat would be the best approach for implementing Tasks with a KEY that operate as followsp  pOption 1 Only one of this key is ever pending.  Can be used, for example, from ASP.NET MVC to queue up a single render for a thumbnail image no matter how many times the image Url is hit.  Only one runs, all other requests wait for that one to complete.p  pOption 2 All items with the same key must execute sequentially.  Can be used for example to ensure that operations that fetch a file from a backing store to a local cache dont all try to get the file to the cache at the same time.  Option 1 is a special case of this where subsequent actions with the same key are simply discarded typically saves just a fileexistscheck.p  pI have an existing WorkQueue that handles both of these cases as well as Apartment state, ThreadPriority settings and maximum degrees of parallelism.  TPL appears to be the best solution for replacing this and will bring improved cancellation options.p  pNested Tasks with continuations look hopeful but maintaining a dictionary of currently queued tasks soon gets messy between the TaskFactory and the TaskScheduler classes.  Inheriting from Task is problematic too since neither TaskFactory nor TaskScheduler are generic on Task.p  pMost Task Parallel examples assume that the set of tasks is known ahead of time.  In this case new tasks are added all the time and need to be either discarded or chained onto existing tasks depending on the operation requested and the key passed in.p  pHas anyone implemented anything similar to this using TPL and if so, what approach did you take in your Task, TaskScheduler and TaskFactory classesp

If the abserror is less than the set amount, we will          set error to 0, effectively telling the equation that the          rover is perfectly on course.         if MyAbserror lt AllowError             error  0          LCD.Lines[2].Text  Error     error.ToStringF2           Calculate proportional term         float proportional  Kp  error           Calculate integral term         float integral  Ki  SteadyError  deltaTime           Calculate derivative term         float derivative  Kd  error  PrevError  deltaTime           Add them all together to get the correction delta          Set the steering servo to the correction         Steering.Degree  90  proportional  integral  derivative           We have applied the correction, so we need to immediately record the           absolute time for generation of deltaTime in the next frame         LastCorrectionTime  DateTime.Now.Ticks           At this point, the current PID frame is finished                    Now, we need to setup for the next PID frame and close out           The current error is now the previous error          Remember, we are done with the current frame, so in          relative terms, the previous frame IS the current frame         PrevError  error           Done         BoardLED.Writefalse      codepre  pDoes anyone have any idea why this is happening or how to fix it p

Negative 4545 pOur shop is integrating ASP.NET MVC into a large web application that utilizes custom amp 3rd party HTTP Handlers defined in web.config under strongsystem.webServerhandlersstrong.  Leveraging HTTP Handlers in this way has been great for us because we dont need to recompile the app or have the actual handler page sitting on disk somewhere in the web scope for each instance of the product.p  pIs it really necessary to add explicit Ignore Routes in our global.asax so the Runtime can honor our Handlers defined in web.config  I would have thought Web.Routing would be invoked strongafterstrong the handlers defined in system.webServerhandlers have been checked not the other way around.p  pWe use a modular design that allows addingdropping Handlers from web.config when features are added.  With the introduction of MVC routing it appears we need to add ignore routes in the global.asax file for every possible handler defined in web.config.p  pNote the actual file to these Handlers dont exist on disk  they are virtual and embedded in an assembly.

Negative 4545 pI am confused as to how to handle this situation.  p  pUsually when an unhandled ASP.Net exception occurs, the server sends back an HTML message of some sort, either the default Asp.Net error handler or a custom error handler.  In either case though, HTML is being sent back and usually its a good idea to make the page user friendly.p  pHowever, I am having an issue where the unhandled exceptions are occurring in Asp.net MVC controller actions that are expected to return JSON for Ajax calls.  When the javascript reads the returned page which is HTML instead of intended JSON it crashes due to not being able to  convert the response into JSON right now Im using ExtJS.  I want Json to be returned upon an exception so that the user can be notified that an error has occurred.p  pThe only solution I can think of is to do the following in every action that returns Jsonp  precodetry  ....  catch Exception ex     return Jsonnew  success  false, msg  ex.Message   codepre  pI dont like that method because it requires me catch all exceptions which is bad for obvious reasons and it requires me to pepper every codeJsonResultcode action with that same exception handling code which makes it hard to change later.  p  pIs there a better method to return a more appropriate error result only on action methods that return Json, but still keep regular error pages user friendly for nonAjax web requestsp

Negative 4545 pall. Im trying to create a vertically fixed navigational menu that is floated in a dynamically positioned div. I want the div to scroll horizontally so that it does not overlap the content on the page, but to be fixed vertically so that it is always visible. Im still getting my feet wet with jquery and although Im quite proud of what I was able to accomplish with my limited knowledge, Ive hit a snag with the bit of code Im trying to implement.p  pIve created 4 functions. One that defines the position of the navigational div getVar, one that takes that current position of the div and manipulates the CSS to allow it to scroll horizontally with the page contentscrollWith, one that calls the second function when the window is scrolledscrollStart, and lastly a function that redefines the position of the div when the window is resized.p  pThe divs position is calculated correctly on load. It will even be correctly recalculated after the window has been resized, but only if the window has NOT been scrolled. Once the window has been scrolled it seems that the updated position variable is not passed on to the function that calculates the CSS position.p  pI have tried creating this where there were only two functions one for on load and one for after the window was resized. These two functions were virtually identical, but did not work the way I had hoped. Ive also tried to create a scrollStop function that would unbind the scroll event when the window was resized and call the scrollStart function after the variables were recalculated, but it seemed that the variables were not refreshed the way I had hoped. There may be a far simpler way to achieve the effect Im after, and any input is greatly appreciated.p  pIve created a fiddle for this as well. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netED3gD relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netED3gDap  pHere is my jqueryp  precodedocument.readyfunction      getVar     scrollStart   window.resizefunction      var timeout  null     return function          if timeout clearTimeouttimeout         timeout  setTimeoutgetVar, 250        function getVar      var p  .navigation     position  p.offset   function scrollWith      win  window     .navigation.cssleft, position.left  win.scrollLeft   function scrollStart      window.scrollscrollWith  codepre  pHere is my HTMLp  precodeltdiv classwrappergt     ltdiv classnavigationgt         ltdiv classmenugt             navigation         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcontentgtcontentltdivgt     wrapper ltdivgt codepre  pHere is my CSSp  precode.wrapper      positionrelative     margin0 auto     backgroundcolorred     width200px   .navigation      float left     positionfixed     width100px     backgroundcoloryellow    .content      positionabsolute     left100px     top0px     margin0     padding0     width100px     height1400px     backgroundcolorblue  codepre

Negative 4545 pI am trying to write a Websockets client and server. Initially the connection is HTTP and the Websockets handshake uses HTTP headers to indicate that an upgrade to a new protocol is necessary on the connection.p  pI want to read in the set of HTTP headers from the SocketChannel and, if an upgrade is indicated, switch over to a different library for handling Websockets and from that point on handle the SocketChannel streams completely differently, as a set of frames rather than lines delimited with rn.p  pI know I can read an arbitrary number of bytes into a ByteBuffer, but a Websockets frame may have been sent with the handshake and I dont want to be passing off halfconsumed buffers between these sections of code. What I want is to read from the socket only the data up to and including sequence rnrn. Any data beyond that I want to leave in the SocketChannel object input stream.p  pWhat is the recommended way to do this Get the input stream from the SocketChannel and wrap it in a buffered reader Would this interact properly with NIO, particularly nonblocking uses Could I drop the buffered reader from the input stream once the blank line was detected and still have all the frame data available when the channel is passed to the Websockets codep  pOr perhaps I need to read bytebybyte or 4 byte chunks with smaller buffers if some of the target rnrn characters appear at the end of the chunk and build up my header strings that way.p  pOr maybe some combination of manipulating mark, limit and position would allow the input stream to get back data it had previously read into the ByteBuffer provided the buffer was allocated directly.p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4545 pI have one view window which I created in the interface builder. I created a UIScrollView which fills the entire window and dragged some other items into it, including a UITextView.

When I then press to write in the TextView the keyboard pops up, this shrinks the ScrollView to screen size  keyboard size I know this happens as I havent implemented the do this once I hide the keyboard function yet, so when I hide the keyboard the ScrollView now ends where the keyboard started.

Negative 4545 pI have a UI Automation application that is written in C and uses .NETcurrently 3.5 but if 4 solves the issue I will gladly change.  I am running in an English version of Windows 7.  I want be able to run this application on any given UI, and have it behave as follows, regardless of how the given UI is setup or what the current system language is, as those things are generally beyond my controlp  pI want to force an application using UI Automation to use the Turkish rules for capitalization.  Particularly, if the automation application was being run on a UI that contained the character i, I want the portions of UI automation that automatically convert a stringcharacter to uppercase to convert that character to  not I.p  pThis is particularly an issue with access and accelerator keys. For example, if a button in a UI had i as its access key, then the codeAutomationElementcode in the UI automation application for that button would list its access key as I, which is incorrect in Turkish.p  pI have tried setting the Thread culture and Thread ui culture to Turkish but that does not work. I am unsure how else to go about forcing the codeAutomationElementcode class to do this.  Any suggestionshelpexamples would be greatly appreciated. p  pIf this was unclear please let me know and I will try to explain it better.p

Negative 4545 pIm trying to write a unit test for an old codepylonscode 0.9.7 application. The issue we have is that its very easy to accidentally hardcode URL paths in our codejinja2code templates, which works fine until someone hosts our application at a different prefix i.e. hosts it at codehttplocalhostfoocode instead of just codehttplocalhostcode. Im doing this using the default functional test setup that paste created for me. I query every controller action, and pass in a custom codeSCRIPTNAMEcode like sop  precoderesponse  self.app.getsomeurlpath,                          extraenvironSCRIPTNAME  customprefix codepre  pI then use codebeautifulsoupcode to parse the document, iterating over all the tags that have an codehrefcode attribute or a codesrccode attribute, and ensure that it starts with customprefix.p  pHeres where things get odd When we pass an absolute path in to codepylons.urlcode which is actually a coderoutes.util.URLGeneratorcodein our templates like thisp  precode h.stylesheetlinkh.urlcssstyle.css  codepre  p...it works perfectly. However, when we call codepylons.urlcode with keyword arguments like thisp  precode h.linktoHome, h.urlcontrollerperson, actionhome  codepre  p...the prefix is not inserted. However, the codeurlcode function works correctly when running this correctly i.e. using codemodwsgicode or codepastedeploycode with a nonempty codeSCRIPTNAMEcode. p  pI guess that Im missing a critical step, but I cant think what it is.p

Negative 4545 pI am analyzing a large amount of files in a Hadoop MapReduce job, with the input files being in .txt format. Both my mapper and my reducer are written in Python.p  pHowever, my mapper module requires access to the contents of an external csvfile, which is basically just a large table to look up reference values for a transformation that the mapper is performing.p  pUp until now, I just had the mapper load the file into memory from a local directory to make it available as a Python variable. Since the file is quite large, though several thousand rows and columns, it takes a relatively long time to be loaded about 10 seconds, too long for my purposes. The problem is that Hadoop seems to reexecute the mapperscript for every new inputfile or it splits large input files into smaller ones, causing my csvfile to be unnecessarily loaded into memory again and again each time a new inputfile is processed.p  pIs there a way to have Hadoop load the file only once and somehow make it globally available Upon googling names like Hive, Pig, sqlite were popping up, but I never saw any examples to check if these are actually useful for this purpose. p  pBasically, I would just need some kind of database or dictionary to be accessed quickly while running my Hadoop job. The format of my reference table, doesnt have to be CSV, I am pretty flexible in transforming that data to different formats.p

Negative 4545 pCompiling code to an object file needs to be done positionindependent if the object file is intended to be loaded as a shared library code.socode, because the base virtual address that the shared object file is loaded into in different processes may be different. p  pNow I didnt encounter errors when I tried to load an code.socode file compiled and linked without the codefpiccode GCC option on 32bit x86 computers, while it fails on 64bit bit x86 computers. p  pRandom websites I found say that I dont need codefpiccode on 32bit because code compiled without codefpiccode works by coincidence according to the X86 32bit ABI also when used in a positionindependent manner. But I still found software that ship with separate versions of libraries in their 32bit versions One for PIC, and one for nonPIC. For example, the intel compiler ships with codelibirc.acode and codelibircpic.acode, the latter being compiled for positionindependent mode if one wants to link that code.acode file into an code.socode file. p  pI wonder what the precise difference between using codefpiccode and not using it is for 32bit code, and why some packages, like the intel compiler, still ship with separate versions of librariesp

Were declaring codestructcodes and so cannot use inheritance to remove code repetition and since the overloaded operators must be declared codestaticcode, they have to be defined for each type separately.emsupp blockquote  pTake this admittedly trivial examplep  precodestruct Area      public static implicit operator Areadouble x  return new Areax      public static implicit operator doubleArea area  return area.x       private Areadouble x  this.x  x      private readonly double x   struct Length      public static implicit operator Lengthdouble x  return new Lengthx      public static implicit operator doubleLength length  return length.x       private Lengthdouble x  this.x  x      private readonly double x  codepre  pBoth codeAreacode and codeLengthcode are basically a codedoublecode, but augment it with a specific meaning. If you defined a method such ashellipp  precode    Area CalculateAreaOfRectangleWithLength width, Length height codepre  phellipit would not be possible to directly pass in an codeAreacode by accident. So far so good.p  pstrongBUTstrong You can easily sidestep this apparently improved type safety simply by casting a codeAreacode to codedoublecode, or by temporarily storing an codeAreacode in a codedoublecode variable, and then passing that into the method where a codeLengthcode is expectedp  precode    Area a  10.0      double aWithEvilPowers  a       CalculateAreaOfRectangleWith doublea, aWithEvilPowers  codepre  pstrongQuestionstrong Does anyone here have experience with extensive use of such custom codestructcode types in realworld  production software If sop  ul lipHas the wrapping of primitive value types in custom codestructcodes ever directly resulted in less bugs, or in more maintainable code, or given any other major advantagespli lipOr are the benefits of custom codestructcodes too small for them to be used in practicepli ul

Negative 4545 psorry for the lengthy post, I have a question about common crpytographic hashing algorithms, such as the SHA family, MD5, etc.p  pIn general, such a hash algorithm cannot be injective, since the actual digest produced has usually a fixed length e.g., 160 bits under SHA1, etc. whereas the space of possible messages to be digested is virtually infinite.p  pHowever, if we generate a digest of a message which is at most as long as the digest generated, what are the properties of the commonly used hashing algorithms Are they likely to be injective on this limited message space Are there algorithms, which are known to produce collisions even on messages whose bit lengths is shorter than the bit length of the digest producedp  pI am actually looking for an algorithm, which emhasem this property, i.e., which, at least in principle, may generate colliding hashes even for short input messages.p  pBackground We have a browser plugin, which for every website visited, makes a server request asking, whether the website belongs to one of our known partners. But of course, we dont want to spy on our users. So, in order to make it hard to generate some kind of surf history, we do not actually send the URL visited, but a hash digest currently, SHA1 of some cleaned up version. On the server side, we have a table of hashes of wellknown URIs, which is matched against the received hash. We can live with a certain amount of uncertainty here, since we consider not being able to track our users a feature, not a bug.p  pFor obvious reasons, this scheme is pretty fuzzy and admits false positives as well as URIs not matched which should have.p  pSo right now, we are considering changing the fingerprint generation to something, which has more structure, for example, instead of hashing the full cleaned up URI, we might insteadp  ol lisplit the host name into components at . and hash those individuallyli licheck the path into components at . and hash those individuallyli ol  pJoin the resulting hashes into a fingerprint value. Example hashing www.apple.comdeshop using this scheme and using Adler 32 as hash might yield 46989670.104268307.413535361985761073204162.p  pHowever, as such a fingerprint has a lot of structure in particular, when compared to a plain SHA1 digest, we might accidentally make it pretty easy again to compute actual URI visited by a user for example, by using a precomputed table of hash values for common compont values, such as www.p  pSo right now, I am looking for a hashdigest algorithm, which has a high rate of collisions Adler 32 is seriously considered even on short messages, so that the probability of a given component hash being unique is low. We hope, that the additional structure we impose provides us with enough additional information to as to improve the matching behaviour i.e., lower the rate of false positivesfalse negatives.p

Lumberjack is a professional logging framework. Its extremely fast and flexible.      It also uses GCD, making it a great fit for GCDAsyncSocket.            As mentioned earlier, enabling logging in GCDAsyncSocket is entirely optional.      Doing so simply helps give you a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the library if you care.      You can do so at the top of GCDAsyncSocket.m,      where you can also control things such as the log level,      and whether or not logging should be asynchronous helps to improve speed, and      perfect for reducing interference with those pesky timing bugs in your code.            There is a massive amount of documentation on the Lumberjack project page      httpcode.google.compcocoalumberjack            But this one line is all you need to instruct Lumberjack to spit out log statements to the Xcode console.      [DDLog addLogger[DDTTYLogger sharedInstance]]       Create our GCDAsyncSocket instance.            Notice that we give it the normal delegate AND a delegate queue.      The socket will do all of its operations in a background queue,      and you can tell it which threadqueue to invoke your delegate on.      In this case, were just saying invoke us on the main thread.      But you can see how trivial it would be to create your own queue,      and parallelize your networking processing code by having your      delegate methods invoked and run on background queues.      asyncSocket  [[GCDAsyncSocket alloc] initWithDelegateself delegateQueuedispatchgetmainqueue]       Now we tell the ASYNCHRONOUS socket to connect.            Recall that GCDAsyncSocket is ... asynchronous.      This means when you tell the socket to connect, it will do so ... asynchronously.      After all, do you want your main thread to block on a slow network connection            So whats with the BOOL return value, and error pointer      These are for early detection of obvious problems, such as             The socket is already connected.       You passed in an invalid parameter.       The socket isnt configured properly.            The error message might be something like Attempting to connect without a delegate. Set a delegate first.            When the asynchronous sockets connects, it will invoke the socketdidConnectToHostport delegate method.      NSError error  nil  if USESECURECONNECTION     uint16t port  443  HTTPS else     uint16t port  8080   HTTP endif      DDLogVerboseport dt host ,port,130.85.92.12      if [asyncSocket connectToHost130.85.92.12 onPortport erroramperror]              DDLogErrorUnable to connect to due to invalid configuration , error          else              DDLogVerboseConnecting...       if USESECURECONNECTION       The connect method above is asynchronous.      At this point, the connection has been initiated, but hasnt completed.      When the connection is establish, our socketdidConnectToHostport delegate method will be invoked.            Now, for a secure connection we have to connect to the HTTPS server running on port 443.      The SSLTLS protocol runs atop TCP, so after the connection is established we want to start the TLS handshake.            We already know this is what we want to do.      Wouldnt it be convenient if we could tell the socket to queue the security upgrade now instead of waiting      Well in fact you can This is part of the queued architecture of AsyncSocket.            After the connection has been established, AsyncSocket will look in its queue for the next task.      There it will find, dequeue and execute our request to start the TLS security protocol.            The options passed to the startTLS method are fully documented in the GCDAsyncSocket header file.      The deusty server only has a development selfsigned X.509 certificate.      So we tell it not to attempt to validate the cert cause if it did it would fail.      NSDictionary options  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject[NSNumber numberWithBoolNO]                                                         forKeyNSString kCFStreamSSLValidatesCertificateChain]      [asyncSocket startTLSoptions]  endif           return self    voidsocketGCDAsyncSocket sock didConnectToHostNSString host portUInt16port      DDLogVerbosesocketdidConnectToHost porthu, host, port       HTTP is a really simple protocol.            If you dont already know all about it, this is one of the best resources I know short and sweet      httpwww.jmarshall.comeasyhttp            Were just going to tell the server to send us the metadata essentially about a particular resource.      The server will send an http response, and then immediately close the connection.      NSString msg  iOS client connectedrnrn     NSData msgdata  [msg dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]      [asyncSocket writeDatamsgdata withTimeout1.0 tag0]       Side Note            The AsyncSocket family supports queued reads and writes.            This means that you dont have to wait for the socket to connect before issuing your read or write commands.      If you do so before the socket is connected, it will simply queue the requests,      and process them after the socket is connected.      Also, you can issue multiple write commands or read commands at a time.      You dont have to wait for one write operation to complete before sending another write command.            The whole point is to make YOUR code easier to write, easier to read, and easier to maintain.      Do networking stuff when it is easiest for you, or when it makes the most sense for you.      AsyncSocket adapts to your schedule, not the other way around.  if READHEADERLINEBYLINE       Now we tell the socket to read the first line of the http response header.

Negative 4545 pWhere I work, we are building a GUI to run on iOS or Android the GUI is intended to control an embedded board.  The embedded board does not have WiFi, an Ethernet port, or a USB port, but it does have an RS232 serial port so we are using a product called a WiSnap.p  pa hrefhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.php relnofollowhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.phpap  pWe have been able to connect to the WiSnap using OS X, or using iOS an iPad 2.  But none of our Android tablets recognize the device at all.  The WiSnap acts as a WiFi access point, and broadcasts an SSID the Android tablets do not list this SSID in the list of available WiFi access points.  Under Linux Mint 12, my Laptop can see the WiSnap, but attempts to connect to it fail.  Interestingly, my cell phone a Droid 2 emisem able to see the WiSnap, but I dont have telnet on my phone so I havent tested to see if it actually works.p  pUnder OS X, I noticed something.  In the dropdown list of WiFi access points, there are two distinct groups the top group, which contains most of the listed WiFi access points, then a lower group, that has a subheading that says Devices and contains just the WiSnap and something called hpsetup.  I dont know what hpsetup is or where it might be there are lots of WiFi users in this neighborhood.p  pThe WiSnap is operating in adhoc mode with no security at all.p  pSo, my question is what is the significance of OS X calling the WiSnap a device  It is frustrating to try to search Google for WiFi devices you get a giant haystack of results that are not related to this.p  pAlso, is there anything we can do to make an Android tablet see the WiSnap and connect to itp  pCan anyone recommend a good resource where I can read up on WiFi  Again Google hasnt helped much there are so many introductions to WiFi out there, most of them at a very simple level.p  pThanks for any help you can give me.p  pEDIT The vendor does claim Android compatibility for some models of WiSnap, but not for others.p  pThis lists Android as supported a hrefhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.php relnofollowhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapKit2.phpap  pThis does not a hrefhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapAAA.php relnofollowhttpserialio.comproductsmobilewifiWiSnapAAA.phpap  pI guess I should contact the vendor, but I do want to emunderstandem what is going on, so I was hoping to get advice from the StackOverflow community about this.p  pEDIT We did contact the vendor.  What we found out is that the WiSnap can be a standalone device only in adhoc mode.  If you set up a WiFi router or access point, the WiSnap will join the network in infrastructure mode.  But the WiSnap will not act as an infrastructure mode access point.p  pAndroid OS at the moment only supports infrastructure mode.  So, if we want to use an Android tablet with a WiSnap we would have to set up some sort of WiFi router or access point.  We are looking into other solutions now.p

Negative 4545 pIm working with a RESTful WCF service. One of the service methods returns byte[] which contains a file.p  pOn the client side, I have some code that uses the WebRequest class to invoke that particular service method. Using the WebRequest, Im getting the response stream likep  pcodeStream stream  webReq.GetResponse.GetResponseStreamcodep  pFrom this stream, I am then reconstructing a byte[] and then outputting the File locally. The problem is that the reconstructed file on the clientside doesnt resemble the file that was returned from the service side I get a corrupt PDF file that is much larger in size than the one sent from the service side. Just before the service method returns the byte[], I outputted that byte[] to disk on the service side and it created the file fine...

Negative 4545 pIm very new to android development.  I would like to make a android app for my senior project.  The idea for the project is this build an app that will show ones location on a map be it on a road or path.  So it looks like using google maps and the Locator class this can be done.  But here is the thing I have shapefile for the path system in esir format.  It looks like one could export this from ArcGIS as a KML file, and then overlay it on top of the google map.  Now of course I would like the GPS location displayed to the user to snap to the nearest path if it is in say 15m of the path to help hide the inaccuracies in the GPS.  I would also like to be able to place notification icons on the map, e.g. path condition, that could be updated from time to time.  I do also have shapefiles for the roads, streams, lakes, etc. for the area, so I could just use them instead of google maps.  Is using google map and overlaying the KML file the best way to do this  Does this sound like a doable projectp

Negative 4545 pIm developing a UDP responder to handle basic SSDP commands.

Negative 4545 pIm having a hard time wrapping my head around a design flaw and Im really hoping the community can help me out. My current design isp  precodeSUBMISSIONS table  submissionID pk, int companyid fk, int productid fk, int vendorid fk, int category VARCHAR price INT approvalstatus TINYINT notes MEDIUMTEXT  VENDOR table  vendorID pk, int vendorname VARCHAR      COMPANY table  companyid pk, int companyname VARCHAR  PRODUCTS table  productid pk, int productnameVARCHAR codepre  pMy Project is vendors submitting products to companies for review. The companies have a dashboard that contains a grid that pulls up all products submitted by vendors to them, they review them, then either approve or deny the products for use.p  pMy issue is this...When pulling up the pending products grid I am grouping the submissions by their category. This way if there are 100 products in a categorywhich is common, they only have to see the category, not the individual products. They can enter notes on the group of submissions in a modal window that pops up from the grid. The id of the window is the first submission in the group and that submission is where the notes are stored. My major concern is that they can approve or deny submissions from the group individually so what happens when they enter notes for the group which is attached to the first submission in the group and then they deny that first submission. Now when they log in again all the notes for the group will seem to be gone because the notes are attached to that first submission which now sits in their denied products folder. There must be a better way of tracking notes to the group originally and then making those notes available to the individual submissions later but Im not seeing it with my limited database design skills.  Any advice at this point is helpful. p

Negative 4545 pOk so I found a hrefhttpfreespace.virgin.nethugo.eliasmodelsmperlin.htmm relnofollowthisa article and I am confused by some parts of it.  If anyone can explain this process in more depth to me I would greatly appreciate it because I have been trying to code this for 2 months now and still have not gotten a correct version working yet.  I am specifically confused about the Persistence part of the article because I mostly do not understand what the author is trying to explain about it and at the bottom of the article he talks about a 2D pseudo code implementation of this but the PerlinNoise2D function does not make sense to me because after the random value is smoothed and interpolated, it is an integer value but the function takes float values  Underneath the persistence portion there is the octaves part.  I do not quite understand because he adds the smoothed functions together to get the Perlin function.  What does he mean byadds because you obviously do not add the values together.  So if anyone can explain these parts to me I would be very happy.

Negative 4545 pIm new to Java FileUpload APIs of Apache, and for a start, I found a a hrefhttpwww.servletworld.comservlettutorialsservletfileuploadexample.html relnofollowtutoriala that explains how FileUpload can be used in a Servlet. Im using Eclipse 3.7 and created Dynamic project to try the example explained in the link. Following is my project directory structure.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKAT79.png altProject Directory Structurep  pWhile the code of codeUploadImage.javacode is same as mentioned in the example, except that I have the servlet file in codeservletscode package and file MIME type is JPEG image instead of plain text. Now, Im new to servlet development in Eclipse, but as per my understanding, the class file created from the servlet must be kept within codeWEBINFclassescode folder, and its entries in the codeweb.xmlcode. Also, the index.jsp code is same as mentioned in the example of given tutorial. Now, I have codeltform actionservlets.UploadImage enctypemultipartformdata methodpostgtcode in my codeindex.jspcode.     When I try to run the project, codeindex.jspcode appears just fun but when I select image file and hit upload, I end up with code404 not foundcode error. Also, how can I make Eclipse put generated class file of codeUploadImage.javacode in codeWEbINFclassescode when I build the project.p  pIve been working to run this simple example for last 4 hours and being new to servlet development in Eclipse, Im clueless about how to work with this, so any help is appreciated.p  pstrongNotestrong All required .jar files are included in the project libraries.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After making changes as suggested by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers157882baluscBalusCa, I still cant get the problem soved.

Negative 4545 pI have thousands of lines of MATLAB code that realizes different computationally intensive operations on fMRI brainimaging data. Many of the operations could be run in multiple parallel threads, but the problem is that all codefprintfcode and codedispcode output of different threadsworkers is printed on the same window.p  pI have written a custom multithreading code that forks out new MATLAB instances using codeunixcode command in Linux environment. So, I first write out .mfiles PreprocessSubj1.m, PreprocessSubj2.m, PreprocessSubj3.m and PreprocessSubj4.m, each of these contains the same computations but for different subjects.

Negative 4545 pI am using Selenium 2.0, Firefox 11.0, and Java to process a table. I have a table element composed of td cells, some which contain text included in a span element, others which contain input elements which have text in their value attributes. My goal is to get the text of every cell so I can output the table contents and compare them against expected values. I thought I would just do something like this Locate the table WebElement by id List cells  tableElem.findElementsBy.xpath.td Then I would loop through all the cells and run findElements with the xpath .input and if the list was empty I would run getText on the webElement, and if the list wasnt empty I would run getAttribute on the input element.p  pBut to my surprise, this took several minutes to run on firefox Im afraid to try it on IE, which is where its supposed to be tested. When I debug it is obvious that the bottleneck is the .input search from the td which is killing me. It is upwards of ten seconds, and so even with just a few cells my tests are taking forever. Ive tried all sorts of minor variations to the xpath, tried going to css selectors, and continue to get the same results. p  pI want some advice about how to either tackle this problem differently or how to optimize my current method.

Negative 4545 pSo Im fairly new to AppKit and Cocoa coming from UIKit with CocoaTouch and Im currently implementing an interface to fold an NSWindow.

I.e. my window INAppStoreWindow by the way consists of a titleBar and a contentView.p  pI guess I could just fold the contentView and resize the window synchronously but itd be preferable if I was able to preserve the transparency while folding which happens due to the perspective transfomation. I.e. the sides that are bent inwards should during the transition be transparent. Or am I overthinking thisp

Negative 4545 pIm trying to figure out the correct layout of classes, methods, files and folders for a MVC design based system.p  pLet say we have a emPageem. emPageem is a simple page with title, text and a sub menu. And it can also include a gallery which would be a separate object both in the database and in the code. p  ol lipI would have a codePageDAOcode class that would have all database related functions it would extend main codeDAOcode class, that would hold generic DB functionality as select, save, delete etcpli lipI would have separate Page class that would define variables and nondb related functions for this objectpli lipI would have the MVC itself where codePageModelcode would construct page codeDAOcode class and page class and build content that would then be processed in controller and prepared for a viewpli lipGallery would be defined in a separate class outside MVC let say libs folder and it would never be used as a view  I mean, I would never call the gallery page itself. Page model would create Gallery class and controller would place it in a page viewpli lipMenu classfunction would be more generic function as it would work for both pages and categories, if the code is used for e.g. shopping site and would also be defined in a separate area could be libs folder again. Menu setup based in that functionality would be called in modelpli ol  pThe above means I would have the following structurep  ul lipmodel, view, controller files and folders based on standard MVC approachpli lipdao lib folder for all codeDAOcode classespli liplib folder for classes like codePagecode, codeMenucode, codeGallerycodepli ul  pDoes it look fair to you Im just anxious not to spread out the code over too much classes as it then means more includes and more object calls.

Negative 4545 pI have a web client that calls my WCF business service layer, which in turn, calls external WCF services to get the actual data. Initially, I thought I would use DTOs and have separate business entities in the different layers... but Im finding that the trivial examples advocating for DTOs, to be, well, trivial. I see too much duplicate code and not much benefit.p  pConsider my Domainp  pExample Domain I have a single UI screen Asp.net MVC View that shows a patients list of medications, the adverse reactions between medications, and any clinical conditions like depression or hypertension the patient may have.

Negative 4545 pstrongThe Backgroundstrongp  pToday I was reflecting on the pain installOS testing. As we approach a new release of our windows software, we have to verifyp  ol liThat it installs without issueli liThat it runs, given a reasonable fulfillment of dependenciesli liThat our assumptions as to what is available on an updated machine are correctli liOn a range of architectures 3264 bit, etcli liOn a range of operating system versions Windows XP, Windows Vista, 7, 8, etc.li ol  pOur sad but usual and cost effective approach is to spin up some old boxes here on site.

Just a liuttle confused because i thought everything within the curly braces was exicuted in the else statement before it runs the else statement again. why isnt it like thisp  pExample  99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.  Put a bottle in the recycling bin, there is now 1 empty bottles in the bin 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.  Put a bottle in the recycling bin, there is now 2 empty bottles in the binp  pi know his is beginner stuff, i am a beginner. can someone explain this to me so i stop going in circles. thanks p

For examplep  precodeReceipt  Id Date Retailer Total FilePath codepre  pI recently transitioned from a role working with Django.  Djangos ORM allows me to easily add a file field type and it will store the path in the database and the file in the file system.  It seems like EF can be manually coded around to do something like that according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5193842fileuploadaspnetmvc30File Upload ASP.NET MVC 3.0a.  I built a prototype based on this artice, but it seems like a waste of time to add this code to each create and update action in controllers.p  pIm assuming theres another way to easily model this and I just havent found it in the docs.  Im even willing to consider something that sticks the file into the database itself for now.  I just want something I can do quickly and not have to add a bunch of bolier plate type code when auto generating the views and controllers based on the model.  I have several of these tables that model a file and specific additional data.p  pNote  This is for a prototype.  Something unlikely to see production in its current form.p

Even weird, the numbers change upon refreshing, and I have no idea whats wrong or even how to figure out whats going on. p  precodeblocks   hbs.registerHelper extend, name, context gt     block  blocks[name]     if not block         block  blocks[name]  []     block.pushcontext.fn this  hbs.registerHelper block, name gt     val  blocks[name]  [].joinn     blocks[name]  []     return val codepre  pIn the layout.htmlp  precode ltheadgt   block stylesheets   block javascripts  ltheadgt codepre  pIn other viewsp  precodeextend stylesheets   ltlink ... gt extend  extend javascripts   ltscript ...  extend codepre  pIn the output html, I get 1 1 . The 1s sometimes randomly change in value, but there are always x of them, where x is the number of extend tags. p  pThanks for any insighthelp anyone might be able to givep  pEDIT  Also, another thing I noticed is that if I change the block helpers top  precode  stylesheets   javascripts codepre  pthe numbers start at 1, and then keep incrementing by 1 each time I refresh the page. Im not sure whats going on, but hopefully thatll help.p
Negative 4545 pIm wondering if anyone knows how to definitively stop the RealPlayer plugin from allowing a user to download videos.p  pSo I work for a company that streams video learning for members. Most our videos are available to paying customers, and all are copyright of my company.p  pSo the new version of RealPlayer has a streaming video downloader integrated into it, so if youre on a webpage with a video, the RealPlayer download window pops up and gives you the option to download the video. In webkit the .mp4 is downloaded and in FireFox and the RealPlayer browser the .flv version is downloaded.p  pSo far my code is thisp  precodefunction    var pluginArray  navigator.plugins    var ua  Mozilla5.0 Macintosh Intel Mac OS X 1082 AppleWebKit536.26.14 KHTML, like Gecko RealPlayer12.0.1.1750     for  var i  0 i lt pluginArray.length i           check to see if the plugin is installed       if  pluginArray[i].description  RealPlayer Plugin                  console.log pluginArray[i].description   is installed.            checks to see if youre using the RealPlayer browser          var re1.

Ideally, we dont want to totally block the content because most our users probably arent downloading the videos, but for the ones that are, we want to stop it. Is there anyway to prevent thisp

Negative 4545 pI am trying to create my own version of a Java Trie in order to have one, and to gain the knowledge it requires to make one, but this project has me perplexed. I have a very basic broken Trie here. p  pI am adding 3 words to the Trie by using the first character of the word as the key, and the value being additional TrieNodes. If you notice, I have print statements inside the TrieNode class to check the values of isWord as the program runs. I want the last character in the word to have the isWord variable set to True. Thus identifying the end of a word which I will later use to get the whole word.p  pWhen I first put the three words in, the output prints every letter of every word as they go into the Trie and correctly identifies which characters are word endings.p  pHowever, if IMMEDIATELY after entering words, I traverse the Trie and reprint all characters in the Trie and their isWord status, the e in Hello is now suddenly identified as a word endingp  pI have poured over this for hours and I just dont see why this is happening.

Negative 4545 pI am getting a series of linker errors when building a specific library for the iOS simulator.  The source of the issue seems to the be architecture that the library was build for which seems to cause issue when compiling for the iOS simulator.  The specific library is the Aurasma augmented reality library.p  pMy question would be this, is there a way to not compile a library when the code is being compiled for the iOS simulator  Although I do have some code that is dependent on that library I could easily use an ifdef statement to only use that code when NOT in the iOS simulator.p  pI can easily admit I may not understand the full root of the issue.  I have attempted some solutions using a weaklibrary linker flag with no specific progress or success.p

Negative 4545 pI am using the plugin Rcarousel a hrefhttpryrych.github.iorcarousel relnofollowhttpryrych.github.iorcarousela with Lightbox that is provided from that site, and all the defaults work fine. I have modified it to use Ajax so that the user can select from a number of images which are links to different galleries which then uses an ajax call to load the carousel. That works for the most part. On loadup I have one of the images called and all the images load up and the carousel and lightbox works perfectly. My issue is when I click on an image, and it loads the new gallery, only the pictures in the carousel that are visible by default options  visible 4 work for lightbox, all the rest just link to the image itself.  Its like the new images are not part of the carousel, but it looks just like it does when it works when I look at it in firebug.p  precodedeclareLightbox function declareLightbox      .lbgallery .rlightbox   declareCarousel function declareCarousel       carousel .rcarousel     auto enabled false,     start generatePages,     visible 4,     pageLoaded pageLoaded,     width 160,     height 120,     margin20  codepre  pI had to modify the script that controls it a little bit to put the declarations inside of functions so that I could call them again from within the Ajax success call, and it seems to have worked fine for the carousel. Is there something else I need to call for lightbox, or am I missing something else entirelyp  pthanksp
Negative 4545 pIm using the Azure SDK in Eclipse, and Im attempting to retrieve a list of all the queues associated with a service bus.

Setting top to 20 and skip to 0 gives the first 20, setting top to 40 and skip to 20 the second 20, and so on.  But if I run the above code I still only print 100 queues.  Is it limited at 100 for some reasonp  pI am aware that I can probably just keep calling listQueues in iterations of 100 and count to see if Ive hit 100, and then run it again, but this is a really strange issue so I thought Id ask since the documentation isnt very clear on this.p  pThanksp

Negative 4545 pI have a webservice that either adds or updates room inventory based on whether it is available or not. Code below. The problem I am having with this code is that it will either do a add or an update for the entire range or throw an error like for example if I am changing inventory for the period 1882013 to 2582013 and 188238 has no inventory but 248258 has, an error is thrown for 248 saying inventory is available and insert is not possible halting the entire process. I want my code to be able to add or update the entire date range rather then just doing an add or amend of everything. Is that possible Do I need to change my code for that How do I do that Would be grateful for any insight on where I have gone wrong or how to change my code to be able to do this. This code is currently LIVE and so is currently affecting our business process so would be thankful for anything.p  precode[WebMethodDescription  Add or Amend Availability amp Rates]         public

Heres an examplep  pThis is in the DevTools editorp  precodecontent .text      display block     fontweight 700     margin 0 0 8px  codepre  pIf you uncheck any of these styles, which take effect in your browser immediately, and you then hit the source tab the styles are still there in the stylesheetp  precodecontent .text      display block     fontweight 700     margin 0 0 8px  codepre  pBUT, if you make an edit to one of the other properties, lets say, changing the margin to read 7px, whilst unchecking the fontweight this is what you getp  precodecontent .text      display block      fontweight 700      margin 0 0 7px  codepre  pFinally the unchecked style is commented out in the sources tab allowing me to save the removed style. I wish this would work without having to make that additional edit but its going to have to do for now.p
Negative 4545 pThe client opens a website through a nonweb app and thus gives an ID and a unique security code through query strings. So the url looks smth like this code...Default.aspxuI21ampscb2r67klcodep  pFor different clients, the website has different content. The users are not more than 10 considering that 1 client is 1 company that has many employeesusers and for all users of 1 company the security code is the same. So 10 users from the same company will have different IDs codeuIcode but the same security code codesccode and so on for the different companies. p  pSo is there point in using Sessions or it is sufficient to use just the query string values for distinguishing the users Whywhy notp  pSuggestion of any other, better way of implementation is welcome. p

Negative 4545 pI am currently evaluating neo4j in terms of inserting big amounts of nodesrelationships into the graph. It is not about initial inserts which could be achieved with batch inserts.

This works fine for sizes lt 200 but if I declare something larger the memory doesnt seem to be freed up when I decrease the size again.p  pHeres an example run I start the program and choose size 50. Then I change sizes between 50, 100, 150 and 200 and see the memory usage go up and down as expected. I then choose size 250 and the memory usage goes up as expected but when I go back to 200 it doesnt decrease but increases to something like the sum of the memory values needed for size 200 and 250 respectively. A similar behaviour is seen with bigger sizes.p  pAny idea whats going onp

How to do it Is it possible to simply check for the White player as well using the same for loops or should I make a new bool for the White playerp  precodeclass goBoard  private   boardSquare entrance  A pointer containing the address of the boardSquareobject at the top left of the grid.   void zip boardSquare, boardSquare   boardSquare makeRow  int amount   int m, n  public   goBoard    goBoard int numberOfRows, int numberOfColumns   goBoard    void build    void computer char colour   bool squareEmpty int x, int y   void human char colour   void print    bool done    bool won    void makeMove int x, int y, char colour  class goBoardbool  goBoardwonBlack      boardSquare currentSquare  entrance assuming that the player starts at the entrance    bool nextSquare  true    if currentSquare.colour  B        for int i  0 i lt 4 i           if nextSquare  true              currentSquare  currentSquare.neighbours[2] .neighbours[2] is a pointer to the square to the right of the current square             if currentSquare.colour  B                nextSquare  false                           for int i  0 i lt 4 i           if nextSquare  true              currentSquare  currentSquare.neighbours[4]             if currentSquare.colour  B                nextSquare  false                           for int i  0 i lt 4 i           if nextSquare  true              currentSquare  currentSquare.neighbours[2].neighbours[4]             if currentSquare.colour  B                nextSquare  false                           for int i  0 i lt 4 i           if nextSquare  true              currentSquare  currentSquare.neighbours[6].neighbours[4]             if currentSquare.colour  B                nextSquare  false                           if nextSquare  true          return true        return false goBoardwon codepre

Negative 4545 pI wrote a largeish library in the Z3 dialect of SMTLIB.  Unfortunately, my use of codedeclaredatatypescode to create tuples means that I cannot set the logic to codeQFAUFBVcode as I desire.

Thus, I want to eliminate codedeclaredatatypescode from my script.  Most of the data types can be encoded as bit vectors.  However, the most important sort in the library is a tuple of a bitvector term and three arrays.  Is there a solution where I can make a sort like this, while still using codeQFAUFBVcode logicp

Negative 4545 pIm developing an ASP.NET application that needs to be able to service files that include range requests. The ASP.NET MVC team has said that a hrefhttpaspnetwebstack.codeplex.comworkitem272 relnofollowthey wont support this within MVCa, and have recommended making use of IIS for serving static files.p  pHeres my issue. When users make requests, they arent going to include any identifying information in the URL that will map directly to a file. The request might look like a hrefhttpwhatever.comDownloadIDTXlGaWxlLnhv34lk relnofollowhttpwhatever.comDownloadIDTXlGaWxlLnhv34lka. Within MVC, I need to make a web service call to resolve that ID to a file that will ultimately be sitting on a network share. In addition, we have our own custombuilt authorization mechanism that each request will have to go through before well service the file.p  pTomasz Pczek implemented a custom ActionResult called a hrefhttptpeczek.blogspot.ca201110rangerequestsinaspnetmvc.html relnofollowRangeFileResulta that seems to be reimplementing the kind of range request support that IIS does by default. Ive tried using it, and it seems to work... but I feel like there should be a way to get IIS to service the static file for me.p  pSo, ultimately, Im wondering if its possible to have MVC receive the request, authenticate amp authorize, resolve the ID to a file path on the network share, and then fall back to IISs StaticFile Handler to actually return the file information.  p

Negative 4545 pWhat is the best way to populate a javascript typed array with literal datap  pRecently Ive been working a lot with javascript typed arrays for some mathematical work.  In particular, Im using lots of Float32Array objects.p  pI often have to manually populate their values.  With a regular array, there is the following literal syntax available codevar a  [0,1,2]code But there seems to be no equivalent way to populate a typed array, so I find I have to do it with lots of individual statementsp  precodevar a  new Float32Array3 a[0]  0 a[1]  1 a[2]  2 codepre  pThis gets very annoying if theres more than about 4 values.  And it seems wasteful too, both in terms of script size, and javascript execution, because it has to interpret all those individual statements.p  pAnother approach Ive used is creating a setter functionp  precodevar populateArraya,vals      var N  vals.length     for var i0 iltN i a[i]vals[i]  var a  new Float32Array3 populateArraya,[0,1,2] codepre  pBut this seems quite wasteful too.  I have to create a regular array as big as the typed array first, to feed into the populateArray function, and then theres the iteration.p  pSo... the question is Is there a more direct and efficient way to fill a typed array with literal datap

Negative 4545 pRecently I have created a form with clientside validation and serverside validation. The clientside validation is being done by the HTML 5 validation email, password, required, pattern, etc..p  pThough, for the client side validation I want to USE the HTML 5 validation but disable the standard markup of the error message, for example the bubble of google chrome with the yellow exclamation mark. Instead I want to use my own CSS error markup so I can style the clientside error message the same as the serverside error message. p  pThe question is if there is a way to achieve this No validation for the form removes the error message but sadly also removes the validation... Other solutions are welcome as well of coursep  pThx in advance  p

Negative 4545 pI am clear about Window heap allocation and stack of heaps etc. Though being new to Linux, i do not have much clarity how does it workp  pOn Windowsp  ol liAt the beginning of a process, the OS creates a default heap called Process heap. The Process heap is used for allocating blocks if no other heap is used. li liLanguage run times also can create separate heaps within a process. For example, C run time creates a heap of its own. li liBesides these dedicated heaps, the application program or one of the many loaded dynamiclink libraries DLLs may create and use separate heaps, called private heapsli liThese heap sits on top of the operating systems Virtual Memory Manager in all virtual memory systems. li lia  CC Runtime CRT allocator Provides malloc and free as well as new and delete operators.  b  The CRT creates such an extra heap for all its allocations the handle of this CRT heap is stored internally in the CRT library in a global variable called crtheap as part of its initialization. c  CRT creates its own private heap, which resides on top of the Windows heap. d  The Windows heap is a thin layer surrounding the Windows runtime allocatorNTDLL. e  Windows runtime allocator interacts with Virtual Memory Allocator, which reserves and commits pages used by the OS.li ol  pOur DLLs and exe link to multithreaded static CRT libraries. Each DLL and exe we create has a its own heap, i.e. crtheap. The allocations and deallocations has to happen from respective heap. That a dynamically allocated from DLL, cannot be deallocated from executable and viceversa. p  pCompiling our code in DLL and exes using MD or MDd to use the multithreadspecific and DLLspecific version of the runtime library, will link both DLL and exe to the same C run time library and hence one crtheap. Allocations are always paired with deallocations within a single module.p  pstrongIs this the same behavior on Liunx What all heaps are there What about CRT heapsstrongp

Negative 4545 pI guess I am looking for something impossible to achieve but I d like to try anyway. I ve read many posts and docs about keeping local changes on git but my current workflow is still bad. p  pstrongThe problemstrong I checkout a project. That project has a folder a module. I then update that module. This folder looks now completely changed to Git eyes. I dont want to commit those changes. Ever. I just want to have my module updated on my local copy.  So far so good but git will always display the entire list of changes that I ve made on that folder cause it thinks I want to commit them. This means I also have to stash them everytime and I cannot do some nice stuff like codegit add ucode because it will commit also this folder. In short, I d like to keep my working copy clean as it should be, just ignoring what I want to ignore.p  pstrongThe first approachstrong codegit ignorecode and codegit excludecode dont work with tracked files. p  pstrongThe second approachstrong codegit updateindex assumeunchangedcode looks promising. But when I merge the folder from another branch this nice assumption is gone and my module updates will be overwritten by the merge. Looking the problem to the other side I eventually still have to stash them anyway which brings back to the original problem.p  pstrongOther approachesstrong I thought as well to codegit rm chachedcode. And then code.gitignorecode the folder. This is still not nice because git will keep this command on stage forever and I will need to keep stashing things.p  pstrongI dont know if I am missing something or asking too much but is that difficultimpossible to get the folders that we want and truly ignore some local changes without the burden of stashing stuff at every merge and having a messy git statusstrongp

Right now, I am binding these events to the codeltbodygtcode as followsp  precodeltbody onclickResetTimeout onkeydownResetTimeout onscrollResetTimeoutgt codepre  pThis works for almost all cases, since each page on my site requires a vertical scrollbar to see the bottom of the page. Any mouse or touchpad press is also captured, anywhere on screen. However, two valid outliers would be for a the user that never scrolls down, and never clicks the mousetouchpad nor presses any keys but is still somehow engaged on the site and b the user that is unlikely but possible moving the mouse leftright but never scrolling, clicking, nor pressing any keys. Both of these users would technically be active on the site but would be considered inactive by my code.p  pI tried accounting for these users by binding the codeonmouseovercode or codeonmousemovecode events to the codeltbodygtcode, but these events are continuously triggered even if you do not move the cursor at all. I found HTML5s codeonmousewheelcode, but this does not work for an optical mouse nor touchpad function never fires so event is never recorded even as you move the cursor all over the screen. p  pIs there an event in jQuery or Javascript that is recorded only whenever a user MOVES the mouse anywhere on the screen and does not remain motionless That is, an event which fires only when xcoord2  xcoord1 or same for ycoord does not equal zero over some time interval My gut feeling is this may be complex and may require the code to record x or y coordinates at different time intervals and then compare. Alternatively, is there any event that would be something like codeonmousestopcode a cursorinmotion stops moving I read about onwheel click a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20105815touchpadscrolldetectioninjsnolibraryherea but I need something for all browsers.

Negative 4545 pI have a page with page buttons that are generated as an unordered list. They are styled so that the page buttons appear as a horizontal row. Because my ul is styled this way, I am having a hard time figuring out how to center it. The is getting its width set to 100 of the div that its in. The buttons each in a li are aligned to the left side of the ul. I need the buttons to be centered in the middle of the div. However, because the ul is 100 width, I cant center the ul in a sense, it already is centered. Im not sure how to get the lis to center inside the ul setting position on the lis to absolute doesnt work because then all of them get put in the same place, overlapping each other.p  pIt would be fine if I could set the width of the ul to exactly that of its contents and then center the ul on the page, but I cant set the ul to a constant width because the width changes depending on how many pages there are some searches result in 40 page, while other have only 1 page.

I just understand you shouldnt do that.  Fine, but can someone help me understand how to accomplish this seemingly simple taskp  pI have a number of entities i use that term loosely, these are not doctrine entities, they are simply fromscratch data models that load data from an external API.  I would like some of these entities to have a getUrl function, so that anywhere I encounter them, I can simply call entitygetUrl and have a proper and consistent url to use.p  pInitially I was constructing these url paths by hand, but then realized, I should be using the urls defined in the routing configuration to generate these.  Then they will REALLY be guaranteed to be consistent sitewide.  So I search and come across these answers on SO that say Your entities shouldnt know about anything but other entities and Create a separate service.  Well, fine, but I still want an entitygetUrl method to call  Is it impossible to achieve this and still adhere to basic principles  Can someone explain to me how I can get it done  If I create a separate service, I still dont seem to be able to accomplish my goal, since you shouldnt access services from inside entities.p  pWhats a guy to do  Can anyone help me understand p

Negative 4545 pIm working on a project in emLaravelem.

Ive read a number of SO answers on it like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10677491howtogetmeteorcalltoreturnvaluefortemplatethis onea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6847697howtoreturnvaluefromanasynchronouscallbackfunctionthis onea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14220321howtoreturntheresponsefromanajaxcallthis onea but none have seemed to lead me in the right direction. p  pAlso, I believe I may need to be using Meteors codewrapAsynccode method, correct Ive tried this and found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17460123meteormethodsreturnsundefinedthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12569712meteorcallinganasynchronousfunctioninsideameteormethodandreturningththisa relevant SO questions on it, but still cant seem to get things right. p  pGrateful for any feedback.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pFor a working approach to integrating Braintree with Meteor, check out the a hrefhttpsgithub.comNickTomlinbraintreemeteorexample relnofollowexample repoa many thanks Nick Tomlin for thisp

Negative 4545 pYes, I am aware that this question has been asked before however, our methods of conducting the functions are different and for this reason I believe that this should not be marked as a duplicate.p  pI am trying to make a Calculator GUI Function, but currently all I can do is have the user click on a number, and then have that number printed out to the screen. p  pWhen I click the divide function this is the only one I have set up currently, 1 is printed out to the screen. Obviously this is not an error, since I am getting the users input the number clicked twice without change.

To scale down the map, I create a single codeBufferedImagecode, codebicode, that is the size of the minimap, then take its codeGraphicscode object, codegcode, convert it to a codeGraphics2Dcode object, codeg2code, then give codeg2code a single set of codeRenderingHintscode, throughp  precodeg2.setRenderingHintsnew RenderingHintsRenderingHints.KEYANTIALIASING,             RenderingHints.VALUEANTIALIASON codepre  pFrom there, I use the codeGraphics.scaledouble sx, double sycode method on codeg2code to set the scale so that upon calling the codepaintGraphics gcode method of the large map with codeg2code as its parameter, it will draw a scaled version of the large map on codebicode that is the exact size of the minimap. This happens 20 times per second somewhat arbitrary, at that speed I think it looks best. The minimap reflects what the user is doing in realtime amp I think it looks laggy if done fewer than 20 times per second.p  pOn my Macbook Pro, The resulting look of this code isp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com91m18.png altenter image description here brThere is no noticeable lag with this code when I run the program, which has led me to keep the picture resampling at 20 times per second, since there appears to be plenty of CPU for this. However, upon exporting my project to a JAR file, the resulting look is thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combJytY.png altenter image description here brThere still is little to no lag with the program running, but what the heck happened So long as I run the code in BlueJ, it works  but in a JAR file, the minimap looks horrible.p  pFor clarification, this is the map to be scaled which, ironically, is being scaled when Im placing it in this post img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvDpdN.png altenter image description here And here are the two BlueJ amp JAR file minimaps, sidebysidep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commJgRp.png altenter image description hereimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVeCaV.png altenter image description herep  pWhat could be the cause of this When I run java version, this is the outputp  pjava version 1.8.031br JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 1.8.031b13br Java HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM build 25.31b07, mixed modep  pTldrbr When I run my code in BlueJ, the small picture looks good.

Negative 4545 pFor whatever reason ugh, just assume we have to, we have a JavaScript file and a CSS file without an extension in our ASP.NET MVC application.

Negative 4545 pFirst off, Im trying to create something like this using Angular.js a hrefhttpsfoursquare.comexploremodeurlampnearSan20Francisco2C20CAampqcomedy relnofollowhttpsfoursquare.comexploremodeurlampnearSan20Francisco2C20CAampqcomedyap  pIn summary, here are the tools Ive triedp  ul liMapbox.jsli liLeaflet.jsli liAngularLeaflet directiveli ul  pFor each, Ive attempted to create a directive that would manage a list of locations that is associated with a map displaying those locations such that, when the user hovers over a list item, a tooltip appears above the locations marker on the map, and when they hover atop the locations marker on the map, a tooltip appears above that marker. If this isnt clear, just visit the link above. Hyperlinks, image, etc. should be able to appear within the tooltip. None of the above seem to give me the map portion of this functionality straight out of the box. Also, in order to even get markers to appear on the map, I have to essentially break away from idiomatic Angular, since the markers are vector items that are generated via the LeafletMapbox toolkit. Writing this code feels wrong. Yes, Im able to see the marker, but I cant really associate them with anything in the DOM. Im confused.p  pIm just at a loss for how to create a smart, interactive map that is associated with other elements on my page. Libraries like Angularleaflet allow you to get a map on your page pretty easily, but customization is PAINFUL or so it seems. Is Angular.js, in combination with any of the above three tools, the way to go Is there something Im simply failing to understandp

There should also be an activity indicator too.p  pI know you cant put a collection view or tableview with a scrollview according to Apple as their are inherited from UIScrollView. And making the whole view controller a table view or collection view is tough since I have so many subviews and actions all linked up already.p  pWhats the best approachp  pThanks.p

Negative 4545 pWhen I first got a Haswell processor I tried implementing FMA to determine the Mandelbrot set. The main algorithm is thisp  precodeintn  0 forint32t i0 iltmaxiter i      floatn x2  squarex, y2  squarey squarex  xx     floatn r2  x2  y2     booln mask  r2ltcut booln is in the float domain non integer domain     ifhorizontalormask break mm256testzpdmask     n  mask     floatn t  xy mul2t mul2t t2     x  x2  y2  cx     y  t  cy  codepre  pThis determines if codencode pixels are in the Mandelbrot set. So for double floating point it runs over 4 pixels codefloatn  m256dcode, codeintn  m256icode.  This requires 4 SIMD floating point multiplication and four SIMD floating point additions.p  pThen I modified this to work with FMA like thisp  precodeintn n  0  forint32t i0 iltmaxiter i      floatn r2  muladdx,x,yy     booln mask  r2ltcut     ifhorizontalormask break     addmaskn,mask     floatn t  xy     x  mulsubx,x, mulsuby,y,cx     y  muladd2.0f,t,cy  codepre  pwhere muladd calls codemm256fmadpdcode and mulsub calls codemm256fmsubpdcode.  This method uses 4 FMA SIMD operations, and two SIMD multiplications which is two less arithmetic operations then without FMA. Additionally, FMA and multiplication can use two ports and addition only one.p  pTo make my tests less biased I zoomed into a region which is entirely in the Mandelbrot set so all the values are codemaxitercode. In this case strongthe method using FMA is about 27 faster.strong Thats certainly an improvement but going from SSE to AVX doubled my performance so I was hoping for maybe another factor of two with FMA.p  pBut then I found a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions13292013isthereanyscenariowherefunctionfmainlibccanbeused1823979518239795thisa answer in regards to FMA where it says p  blockquote   pThe important aspect of the fusedmultiplyadd instruction is the virtually infinite precision of the intermediate result. This helps with performance, but not so much because two operations are encoded in a single instruction  It helps with performance because the virtually infinite precision of the intermediate result is sometimes important, and very expensive to recover with ordinary multiplication and addition when this level of precision is really what the programmer is after.p blockquote  pand later gives an example of doubledouble to a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiQuadrupleprecisionfloatingpointformatDoubledoublearithmeticdoubledoublea multiplication p  precodehigh  a  b  doubleprecision approximation of the real product  low  fmaa, b, high  remainder of the real product  codepre  pFrom this, I concluded that I was implementing FMA nonoptimally and so I decided to implement SIMD doubledouble. I implemented doubledouble based on the paper a hrefhttpandrewthall.orgpapersdf64qf128.pdfExtendedPrecision FloatingPoint Numbers for GPU Computationa. The paper is for doublefloat so I modified it for doubledouble. Additionally, instead of packing one doubledouble value in a SIMD registers I pack 4 doubledouble values into one AVX high register and one AVX low register.p  pFor the Mandelbrot set what I really need is doubledouble multiplication and addition. In that paper these are the codedf64addcode and codedf64multcode functions. The image below shows the assembly for my codedf64multcode function for a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions28630864howisfmaimplemented3012121730121217software FMAa left and hardware FMA right. This clearly shows that hardware FMA is a big improvement for doubledouble multiplication.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com23Ezv.png altfma software vs hardwarep  pSo how does hardware FMA perform in the doubledouble Mandelbrot set calculation strongThe answer is thats only about 15 faster than with software FMA. Thats much less than I hoped for.strong The doubledouble Mandelbrot calculation needs 4 doubledouble additions, and four doubledouble multiplications codexxcode, codeyycode, codexycode, and code2xycode. However, the a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions7720668fastmultiplicationdivisionby2forfloatsanddoublescc3045384230453842code2xycode multiplication is trivial for doubledoublea so this multiplication can be ignored in the cost. Therefore, the reason I think the improvement using hardware FMA is so small is that the calculation is dominated by the slow doubledouble addition see the assembly below.p  pIt used to be that multiplication was slower than addition and programers used several tricks to avoid multiplication but with Haswell it seems that its the other way around. Not only due to FMA but also because multiplication can use two ports but addition only one. p  pSo my questions finally arep  ol liHow does one optimize when addition is slow compared to multiplication li liIs there an algebraic way to change my algorithm to use more multiplications  and less additions I know there are method to do the reverse, e.g. codexyxy  xxyy  2xycode which use two more additions for one less multiplication.li liIs there a way to simply the df64add function e.g. using FMAli ol  pIn case anyone is wondering the doubledouble method is about ten times slower than double. Thats not so bad I think as if there was a hardware quadprecision type it would likely be at least twice as slow as double so my software method is about five times slower than what I would expect for hardware if it existed. p  pcodedf64addcode assemblyp  precodevmovapd 8rsp, ymm0 movq    rdi, rax vmovapd 72rsp, ymm1 vmovapd 40rsp, ymm3 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm0, ymm4 vmovapd 104rsp, ymm5 vsubpd  ymm0, ymm4, ymm2 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm1, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm4, ymm2 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm0, ymm0 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm0, ymm2 vaddpd  ymm5, ymm3, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm3, ymm1, ymm6 vsubpd  ymm6, ymm5, ymm5 vsubpd  ymm6, ymm1, ymm6 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm2, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm6, ymm3, ymm3 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm4, ymm2 vaddpd  ymm5, ymm3, ymm3 vsubpd  ymm4, ymm2, ymm4 vsubpd  ymm4, ymm1, ymm1 vaddpd  ymm3, ymm1, ymm0 vaddpd  ymm0, ymm2, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm1, ymm2 vmovapd ymm1, rdi vsubpd  ymm2, ymm0, ymm0 vmovapd ymm0, 32rdi vzeroupper ret codepre

Negative 4545 pI have a friend who is virtually blind. He wants his emails to be sorted by descending order of received date. He keeps clicking on other field names by accident and then cannot find how to sort by received date again. He has screen reading software but it does not appear to read the column headers.p  pI want to create a button on the toolbar that would sort the emails by received date, either by calling a macro or any other means.  The screen reading software would help him find the button  but it seems surprisingly difficult to get this button to work as needed. p  pIve tried using codeItems.sortcode, but this does not seem to affect the display view.p  pI tried setting up a new view called Inbox sorted so I could switch to this view using VBA, but the problem with the named view is when I click on another column to sort, e.g. size, this seems to permanently change the view so its now sorted by size whenever recalled  so when my macro calls up this view its sorted by size instead of by date as needed. There is a reset button on the toolbar, but its greyed out. p  pI found there is some XML associated with the view. I can read it usingp  precodeDebug.Print Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.CurrentView.XML codepre  pbut I have no idea how to safely edit this.p  pAny thoughts It doesnt have to be done by a macro all I want is to make it easier for him to have his inbox sorted by date, and Im open to any way of achieving this.p  pEdit the code I wrote to change view isp  precodeSub ChangeViewToInboxSorted  Dim myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer  Set myOlExp  Application.ActiveExplorer myOlExp.CurrentView  Inbox Sorted  End Sub codepre  pThis doesnt do the job because as I mentioned, clicking on a column heading at any time the view is active permanently changes the definition of the view.p
Negative 4545 pBasically I have an appusing devise, where a user signs up coderegistrationsnewcode with just an email and password this registers and creates the user. It immediately takes them to coderegistrationseditcode where they enter the rest of their information. p  pI am using a codenamecode attribute with friendlyid for vanity urls. This attribute has 3 requirements p  ol liIt must be written once but unchangeable after it is written. li liIt can not be any of the controller names or it will break the app. li liIt is uniqueli ol  pFor 2  So I added the following validation to my model   p  precode  validates name, exclusion gt  in gt w   admin cars registrations users  , message gt Sorry value is taken codepre  pFor 3 I added  codevalidatesuniquenessof namecodep  pFor 1 I have the following in my view under registrationsedit p  precodelt if user.name.blankgt                 ltbrgt                 lth2gtChoose your usernamelth2gt                      lt f.input name,  value gt Username , required true, autofocus true, labelfalse, class usernameinputc  gt  ltbrgt codepre  pThis effectively hides it from the user if it doesnt exist. The problem I am having is that if they enter a controller name as their codenamecode or something already taken it will give a devise error, and send them back but the field will be hidden. If i remove the conditional then it allows them to change their codenamecode even if it was valid How can i make it so it shows only if the name attribute hasnt savedp  pNote I tried codeif user.name.persistedcode it gave me a no method error for nilClassI think because codenamecode didnt exist.p  h1UPDATEh1  pSo I have tried to add it as a virtual attribute, I have added a field username to my permitted params as a virtual attribute. Having a little bit of trouble with the getter and setter methods. I tried this p  precodedef username   self.name if  self.name.persisted end codepre  pI still get a no method error.p

Negative 4545 pUnfortunately I did not find the answer by myself in documentation or in google, so maybe you can help me to find out one thing. Just imagine that we have directive myDirective. It is located on some div element. When I remove this div using remove method from jQuery, then an destory event is triggered on this DOM node. But scope of myDirective still exists. I can listen to destroy even on div element and manually call scope.destroy, but why angular does not do thisp

Negative 4545 pIm trying to add my first CLR routine to SQLServer 2008 will upgrade to 2014 soon.  The goal is to add a user object to Active Directory, passing in a dozen or so attribute values, to create the user based on data coming from an interface to an ERP the interface works fine, the data is good.  A colleague create a compact C class that wraps the PrincipalContext, actually took the code from another working application and streamlined it a bit see below.p  pWe were able to turn on CLR, set the DB to TRUSTWORTHLY, and so on, then do the CREATE ASSEMBLYs for his code and the resources it needs, with UNSAFE option since the code is not part of Microsofts subset of .NET classes vetted to run within SQLServerp  precodealter database Util SET TRUSTWORTHY ON  CREATEALTER ASSEMBLY SystemDSProtocols FROM CWindowsMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv2.0.50727System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.dll WITH PERMISSIONSET  UNSAFE  CREATEALTER ASSEMBLY SystemDSAccountManagement FROM CProgram FilesReference AssembliesMicrosoftFrameworkv3.5System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.dll WITH PERMISSIONSET  UNSAFE  CREATEALTER ASSEMBLY XXXXXXXXXCLR FROM CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.CLRXXXXXXXX.CLR.dll WITH PERMISSIONSET  UNSAFE codepre  pAll the creates and subsequent ALTERs run fine, we ALTER the last one whenever we change the custom class library XXXXXXXCLR which ive obscured here... the CLR stored procedure creates fine, and executes OK up until it tries to SAVE the user through the PrincipalContext object.  Code and error message we are getting follow.p  pIve read 50 web pages looking for an answer to this error weve temporarily made the user that SQLserver runs as a Domain Admin dev systemterrible practice Im sure, called it from a logged in SQL user with domain admin rights, given the domain service account that the code is able to pass in for explicit .NET AD connection domain admin, taken the user and password options off the call to PrincipalContext to see if SQLServers user or the calling users privs would control it, tried different combinations of the Options on the PrincipalContext constructor call, etc.p  precode         Create PrincipalContext         PrincipalContext principalContext  null         try                       as given, used Simplebind only             principalContext  new PrincipalContext                 ContextType.Domain,                     LdapName,               Domain name  xxxx.yyyy                 StudentContainer,       ouaaaa,oubbbb,dcxxxx,dcyyyy                 ContextOptions.Negotiate                 ContextOptions.SecureSocketLayer                 ContextOptions.SimpleBind,                                ContextOptions.Signing                                  ContextOptions.Sealing,                                ContextOptions.ServerBind                 ContextUser,                 ContextPassword                               catch Exception ex                      throw new ExceptionFailed to create PrincipalContext.

I did bounce SQLServer after putting the service account it is running under in the domain admins group, BTW.p  pMany thanks for your kind review of this longwinded problem.p
