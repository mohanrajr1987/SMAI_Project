Positive 59504 pIm having an issue in IE9 which is in IE7 and IE8 as well not in IE6 and below because they dont support codeposition fixedcode in which if I add codeoverflowy scrollcode to an element within a codeposition fixedcode element, the scrollbar on the codeoverflowy scrollcode element occupies some of the width of the element instead of adding the necessary number of pixels to the width to the element to make room for the scrollbar.p  pThe following HTMLCSS demonstrates the issuep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetUTF8gt     lttitlegtIE9 position fixed issuelttitlegt     ltstylegt       body, div, html, p          margin 0         padding 0              .fixed          left 10px         position fixed         top 50px              .outer          height 300px         overflowy scroll              .inner          background yellow         height 500px         width 300px            ltstylegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv classstatsgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classfixedgt       ltdiv classoutergt         ltdiv classinnergt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltscriptgt       var stats  document.querySelector.stats,         outer  document.querySelector.outer,         inner  document.querySelector.inner        stats.innerHTML           ltpgtOuter width   outer.getBoundingClientRect.width  pxltpgt        stats.innerHTML           ltpgtInner width   inner.getBoundingClientRect.width  pxltpgt     ltscriptgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pIf you run this code in Chrome, FF, etc., you will get an outer width of 317px and an inner width of 300px.

Positive 59504 pSo Im creating an application which uses CORS to communicate with a .NET MVC Sidecar project. Everything works great except for in IE9, where POST requests fail. I have a a hrefhttpsgithub.comMoonScriptjQueryajaxTransportXDomainRequest relnofollowlibrarya which allows the GETs to work, but the POST requests are still having issues.

Negative 59504 pWere looking for a way to include some sort of build ID automatically in our builds. This needs to be portable VC, g on Linux and Mac and automatic. VC is what matters most, since in the other environments we use custom Python build scripts so I can do whatever I want.p  pWe use SVN, so we were looking at using the output of svnversion to write the revision to a header and include it. This has problems  if we put the file in SVN, it will appear as modified every time, but it would be a superfluous commit and in a sense generate an infinite loop of increasing revisions. If we dont put the file in SVN and just create it as a prebuild step, the sources wouldnt be complete, as theyd need the prebuild step or Makefile to generate that file.p  pWe could also use codeDATEcode but we cant guarantee the file that uses the codeDATEcode ie writes it to a log file will be compiled if some other file is modified  except if we touch it, but then wed cause the project to be always out of date. We could touch it as the prebuild step, so it would get touched only if the rest of the project is out of date, thus not causing a spurious compile, but if VC computes the dependencies embeforeem the prebuild step, this wouldnt work the file with codeDATEcode wont get compiledp  pAny interesting ideasp

Negative 59504 pIm a big fan of TDD and use it for the vast majority of my development these days.  One situation I run into somewhat frequently, though, and have never found what I thought was a good answer for, is something like the following contrived example.p  pSuppose I have an interface, like this writing in Java, but really, this applies to any OO languagep  precodepublic interface PathFinder      GraphNode[] getShortestPathGraphNode start, GraphNode goal      int getShortestPathLengthGraphNode start, GraphNode goal  codepre  pNow, suppose I want to create three implementations of this interface.  Lets call them codeDijkstraPathFindercode, codeDepthFirstPathFindercode, and codeAStarPathFindercode.p  pThe question is, how do I develop these three implementations using TDD  Their public interface is going to be the same, and, presumably, I would write the same tests for each, since the results of getShortestPath and getShortestPathLength should be consistent among all three implementations.p  pMy choices seem to bep  ol lipWrite one set of tests against codePathFindercode as I code the first implementation.  Then write the other two implementations blind and make sure they pass the codePathFindercode tests.  This doesnt seem right because Im not using TDD to develop the second two implementation classes.pli lipDevelop each implementation class in a testfirst manner.  This doesnt seem right because I would be writing the same tests for each class.pli lipCombine the two techniques above now I have a set of tests against the interface and a set of tests against each implementation class, which is nice, but the tests are all the same, which isnt nice.pli ol  pThis seems like a fairly common situation, especially when implementing a Strategy pattern, and of course the differences between implementations might be more than just time complexity.

Negative 59504 pI am designing an API and I would like it to be simple to use.  So, if I have Customers, Statements, and Payments.  Does it make sense to have objects such as  Customer, CustomerHandler, Statement, StatementHandler, Payment, PaymentHandler  This way when the developer wants to do something with customers heshe knows to create a CustomerHandler and then all of the possible functions that one would like to perform with a customer are inside the handler.  p  pMethods like  CustomerHandler AddCustomercustomer, GetCustomercustomerID, GetCustomerCount StatementHandler AddStatementcustomerID, GetStatementstatementID, GetStatementCountcustomerID PaymentHandler GetPaymentsByCustomercustomerID, GetPaymentpaymentID, GetPaymentCountByCustomercustomerIDp  pThis way if the developer wants to work on receiving payments heshe knows to go to the PaymentHandler.  My coworker thought that functions like GetPaymentscustomerID belong in a class that manages the customer.  So, it would be like Customer.GetPayments AS Payments.  But if I have some other entity like Worker, there would be Worker.GetPayments AS Payments.  So, I see the logic with both approaches.  The first one groups things together so that if no matter whom the payment is coming from you get it all from one class by having functions like GetPaymentsByCustomerCustomerID and GetPaymentsByWorkerWorkerID.  This way one does not have to stumble through different handler or manager objects to get payments.  Both approaches make sense to me, how about you  Or, are we both off and there is a better way to do this Thanks in advancep

Negative 59504 pAlright heres the deal, Im taking an intro to C class at my university and am having trouble figuring out how to change the extension of a file. First, what we are suppose to do is read in a .txt file and count words, sentences, vowels etc. Well I got this but the next step is whats troubling me. We are then suppose to create a new file using the same file name as the input file but with the extension .code instead of .txt in that new file we are then to encode the string by adding random numbers to the ASCII code of each character if you were interested. Being a beginner in programming, Im not quite sure how to do this. Im using the following piece of code to at first get the input filep  precodecout ltlt Enter filename  cin gtgt filename infile.openfilename.cstr codepre  pIm assuming to create a new file Im going to be using something likep  precodeoutfile.opentest.code codepre  pBut I wont know what the file name is until the user enters it so I cant say test.txt. So if anyone knows how to change that extenstion when I create a new file I would very much appreciate itp

Negative 59504 pstrongEDIT 11202009strong This question was posted quite some time ago, but the problem just crept up again this morning so Im hoping somebody else can provide some insight though the answers provided already have been helpful.p  pOnce in a blue moon in our production environment we get a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode from referencing the codeItemscode property of a codeListBoxcode control. Ive included some example code below.p  pThe parent form of the codeListBoxcode in question holds a private codeQueueltstringgtcode called codeQueuedMessagescode. This queue receives new messages on events. On a timer that goes off every 500 ms, the following method gets executedp  precodevoid DisplayQueuedMessages      lock QueuedMessages          while QueuedMessages.Count gt 0              string msg  QueuedMessages.Dequeue             this.lbxMessages.Items.Insert0, msg  NullReferenceException             if this.lbxMessages.Items.Count gt MAXLBXITEMS                  this.lbxMessages.Items.RemoveAtMe.lbxMessages.Items.Length  1                             codepre  pAgain, as Ive mentioned, this only throws codeNullReferenceExceptioncode emveryem rarely. In several months of using the application it has happened three or four times.p  pFurthermore, the few times this has happened, it seems either the codeListBox.Itemscode property or just the codeListBoxcode itself is mysteriously gone for good all subsequent methods that add items to the codeListBoxcode throw exceptions. The only way to recover is to close the application and bring it back up.p  pUnfortunately, constantly distracted with a million other things to do, I never got around to adding logging before the insertions. Ive added the logging now, but it could be a month or more before we see this problem again. In the meantime, any more ideas What are some possible explanations for thisp  pI guess my real question is strongHas anyone else ever seen this happen  accessing a codeListBoxcode that emdidem exist and suddenly getting a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode  and were you ever able to figure out whyhow to fix the problemstrongp
Negative 59504 pHi does anyone know if there are any inbuilt classes for resolving a bound object from a bindingexpression and its DataItem and property pathp  pIm attempting to write a Blend 3 behavior for textboxes which automatically invokes methods on an object bound to the textbox Text property.p  pThe textbox is bound to a property on a viewmodel class.

Ive searched around the .NET documentation and bounced around the assemblies with reflector, all to no avail  I cant find what surely must exist  theres got to be some class which performs the resolution of the path for the dataitem the data context.p  pDoes anyone know where this might exist  Any suggestions for alternative ways of resolving the bound objectp  pNote, Im trying to get at the bound object which is the emparentem of the bound property the string in this case  I can obviously easily get at the bound value, but its the parent I need.p  pThanks in advance for any help Philp

Negative 59504 pI have been working to create WCF services that will operate independent of .Net clients.  Thanks to Google and StackOverflow, I have been able to create both simple xml and json services without Soap wrappers and a bunch of fancy WCF stuff that I just dont need.  It has been a painful experience, hence the subject line of this question.  WCF is mad buggy on the client side when using WebGet and WebInvoke when automatically adding the service reference.p  pTo inspect the communication, Ive been creating a WCF client locally and passing everything through a hrefhttpwww.fiddler2.comfiddler2 relnofollowFiddlera.  That way, whether it works or not, I can at least see what the client is trying to send.  And when it finally does work, I can see the data being sent from both ends and then duplicate this communication in a non.Net client.p  pMy current problem is that when I change the service to expect POST data as json enableWebScript behavior, the client has no idea, and it still tries to send the objects as xml.  Ive had a ton of issues with the clients config not automatically being set properly when using Add Service Reference, so Im hoping its something simple I can add to the app.config on the client.  When using XML, the objects I create and use in the service are automatically xml serialized by the client which is most convenient.  Is that even possible to do as json in the current version of WCFp  pIt should be noted that I was able to figure out what I need to do manually and get it to work in a raw form with Fiddler request builder, so I can serialize my objects in code and send the data manually via http post...thats how Im doing it in my non.Net clients anyway.  This is more of a question to understand the WCF aspects better and why Im missing so many attributes on the client side where theres little to no documentation available to address the issues.p

Negative 59504 pemI have this general problem in design, refactoring or triageemp  pI have an existing multithreaded C application which searches for data using a number of plugin libraries. With the current search interface, a given plugin receives a search string and a pointer to a QList object. Running on a different thread, the plugin goes out and searches various data sources locally and on the web and adds the objects of interest to the list. When the plugin returns, the main program, still on the separate thread, adds this data to the local data store with further processing, guarding this insertion point using a mutex.  Thus each plugin can return data asynchronously. p  pThe QTbase plugin library is based on message passing. There are a fair number of plugins which are already written and tested for the application and they work fairly well. p  pI would like to write some more plugins and leverage the existing application. p  pThe problem is that the new plugins will need more information from the application. They will to need intermittent access to the local data store itself as they search. So to get this, they would need direct or indirect access both the hash array storing the data and the mutex which guards multiple access to the store. I assume the access would be encapsulated by adding an extra method in a catalog object.p  pI can see three ways to write these new plugins. p  ol lipWhen loading a plugin, pass them a pointer to my catalog at the start. This becomes an extra, invisible interface for the new plugins. This seems quick, easy, completely wrong according to OO but I cant see what the future problems would be. pli lipAdd a methodmessage to the existing interface so I have a second function which could be called for the new plugin libraries, the message would pass a pointer to the catalog to the plugins. This would be easy for the plugins but it would complicate my main code and seems generally bad. pli lipRedesign the plugin interface. This seems best according to OO, could have other added benefits but would require all sorts of rewriting.pli ol  pSo, my questions arep  pA.

Negative 59504 pI have been asked to do something and i am very new to Sharepoint development and customisation so am a bit unsure how to go about it, or if it is even possible.  The brief is to create a web part that shows a list of sub sites of the current site, i have messed around and have created a web part which does this.p  pThe second part of the problem is this list needs to be filtered but its current active state and also what type of site it is, which means i only want to show Active Projects which are of the type Work Projects.  Is it possible to create properties like this for a site in sharepoint, and how can i access them to perform some form of filtering, maybe by just using a foreach loop or using LINQ, i am just a bit confused about how i can go about this and am struggling to find anything really concrete on this.p  pThanks,p  pRobp

Negative 59504 pIm struggling to figure out how to compare MySQL dates with current system time using perl.p  pI have a script that runs on a cron job that will send notification if the current system datetime is past the datetime of a returned recordp  pAn application displays a table viewp  precodeEventId    Device        Location  CC 123    something     BFE TT 456    anotherthing  BFE codepre  pHow the script works is it finds values in the field EventID, parses the type CC, TT, etc from the ID the numeric portion.  The ID is a Unique ID in another databasetable which contains an end time field. EventID itself is not Unique and may have duplicate items in the table. Sub routines for each type exist since each type has a different database andor table.p  pThe goal is that the script runs every minute and toggles the value of Expired.  It is possible for something to expire, a change to be made and subsequently unexpire.p  pThe script works fine save for 1 issue which appears to be related to timezones based off of the feed back Ive recieved here so far.

On creation, the object receives the amount and the currency an object provided by the localization class maybe. You can add to or multiply the amount. The add method takes another money object as parameter, and if it has a different currency, a convertion is made automatically. Somewhere an array is stored with all the standard names such as enUS and USD, relating them appropiately, and also relating them to the equivalent in USD as a scalar value. Money objects should be able to print the amounts in different formats, such as  1000, or Us, etc.p  ul liIs this a good way to deal with thisli liWhich standar should I followli liDo you know any already existent, decoupled php libraries to do thisli ul

Negative 59504 pI have a rails app where users share specific kinds of photos. Currently the app requires photos to be categorized in several ways before they are valid, hence users must upload photos one at a time and categorize them in order to save them to the database.p  pCategorization takes some time, so Id like to allow users to upload batches of photos and then come back and categorize them when they have time, but when photos are stored without being fully categorized I dont want them mixed in with complete photos.p  pId ideally like this to be a sort of Wizard system where users can upload a bunch of photos at once and then proceed through their personal queue and categorize each photo to finish creating it when they have time.p  pMy question is how would you approach a problem like thisp  pIve been thinking about using Single Table Inheritance to create two subclasses of Photo codeIncompletePhotocode and codeCompletePhotocode. The codeIncompletePhotocode would only require the image file itself, but codeCompletePhotocode would require categorization.

Negative 59504 pI am writing a hrefhttpsgithub.comSevisStudyStreamssomethinga like an interactive tutorial for C.  The tutorial will consist of two parts  one is compiled into a library Im using Scons to build that, and the other the lessons is shipped with the tutorial to be compiled by the end user.  Im currently looking for a good, easy way for people to build these lessons.p  pBasically, the second part is a directory with all the lessons in it, each in its own directory.  Each lesson will have at least a codelesson.cppcode and a codemain.cppcode file, there may be also other files, the existence of which I will not know until after it is shipped  the end user will create these.

Negative 59504 pI have an iframe which contains a few select dropdown lists for data entry. I recently began noticing that mouseclicking the select element in the iframe, the dropdown list doesnt expand. The user can click on the dropdown to set focus on it, and then scroll through the contents using updown arrow on the keyboard, but clicking the arrow button beside the list doesnt cause it to expand amp show its contents.p  pThe parent page this frame is embedded on resides on a different domain. Initially I thought this might have something to do with javascript onfocus events within the iframe. I stripped out all of the scripting, got rid of all of the css and pared it down to a simple static html parent with a simple iframe page of static html containing just a select element. When run on the same server, the dropdown behaves normally, but when the parent page resides on one domain, and the iframe content on another, the select list cannot be expanded.p  pThis problem only seems to occur in IE7. Ive tested in IE8 amp IE9 without any problems, as well in Safari, Chrome amp Firefox.

Negative 59504 pI am using the C codeUdpClientcode class to to UDP networking. There is one codeUdpClientcode object, bound to a fixed local port, but not to any remote endpoint, because it needs to be able to sendreceive tofrom multiple different endpoints.p  pI have two threads One for sending, one for receiving. Now, when I send data to an endpoint that exists, but doesnt listen on that port, I expect a codeSocketExceptioncode. And I do get one. Unfortunately, it is not my codeSendcode call that returns the exception, but the codeReceivecode call. So on my sending thread, I send data to an invalid endpoint, and my receiving thread gets the exception. Unfortunately, at that point, I have of course no idea what endpoint caused that exception to happen.p  pStoring the endpoint before sending, then accessing that in the receiving thread is just a race condition error waiting to happen.p  pUnfortunately, the codeSocketExceptioncode does not give me the endpoint that caused the error.p  pAny ideas Is it somehow possible to make the exception be thrown on the sending threadp  pHelp is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 59504 pI am working on a project on a very simple website with 5 pages. Each page is a GWT Widget UI Binder. I am currently creating objects of all 5 Widgets, when i load the Base Presenter, where i handle all History Token Change Events. The Problem is, the website is really slow to load in Development Mode. When hosted in AppEngine its much better in speed. How can i overcome this Issue. p  pEarlier i used to create objects on request. ie., if a user clicks a link, i will create the object of that Widget and display it. But if he comes back to previous page and clicks the same link again, it will create a new object and the old objects memory is not cleared since it is not java after compiling. This is why i created all Objects at the Beginning. p  pI dont know where i have went wrong. Can anyone please suggest me a suitable technique to overcome this issue. p

Negative 59504 pI have a Java batch which does a select with a large resulset I process the elements using a Spring callbackhandler.  The callbackhandler puts a task in a fixed threadpool to process the row.  My poolsize is fixed on 16 threads.  The resulset contains about 100k elements. All db access code is handled through a JdbcTemplate or through HibernateSpring, no manual connection management is present. I have tried with Atomikos and with Commons DBCP as connection pool.p  pNow, I would think that 17 max connections in my connectionpool would be enough to get this batch to finish. One for the select and 16 for the threads in the connectionpool which update some rows. However that seems to be too naive, as I have to specify a max pool size a magnitude larger havent tried for an exact value, first I tried 50 which worked on my local Windows machine, but doesnt seem to be enough on our Unix test environment. There I have to specify 128 to make it work again, I didnt even try a value between 50 and 128, I went straight to 128.p  pIs this normal Is there some fundamental mechanism in connection pooling Im missing I find it hard to debug this as I dont know how to see what happens with the opened connections. I tried various log4j settings but didnt get any satisfactory result.p  pedit, additional info when the connectionpool size seems to be too low, the batch seems to hang. If I do a jstat on the process I can see all threads are waiting for a new connection. At first I didnt specify the maxWait property on the dbcp connection pool, which causes threads to wait indefinitely on a new connection, and I noticed the batch kept hanging. So no connections were released. However, that only happened after processing 70k rows, which dismissed my initial hunch of connection leakage somehow.p  pedit2 I forgot to mention I already rewrote the update part in my tasks. I qeueu my updates in a ConcurrentLinkedQueue, I empty that on 1000 elements. So i actually only do about 100 updates.p  pedit3 Im using Oracle and I am using the concurrent utils. So i have an executor configured with fixed poolsize of 16. I submit my tasks on this executor. I dont use connections manually in my tasks, I use jdbctemplate which is threadsafe and asks it connections from the connectionpool. I suppose SpringDBCP handles the connectionthread issue.p

Then when a user hovers over a specific ImageButton, its image will switch from image2 to image 3.  p  pThanks in advance for any suggestions you may have as to the best approach.p  pEDITp  pNot sure if this is the best approach, but I found a potential solution using jQueryp  precodeltItemTemplategt     ltdiv classgvRowgt          ltaspImageButton IDbtnSelect CssClassbtnSelect runatserver ImageUrlimagesiconSelect1.png onmouseoverthis.src..imagesiconSelect3.png onmouseoutthis.src..imagesiconSelect2.png gt      ltdivgt ltItemTemplategt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                                              .gvRow.hover         function               this.find.btnSelect.attrsrc, ..imagesiconSelect2.png         ,         function               this.find.btnSelect.attrsrc, ..imagesiconSelect1.png               ltscriptgt codepre  pSo far, this is working well, but Im open to suggestions for handling this better. p  pHopefully, this will help someone else.p

Negative 59504 pI am expandingconverting a legacy Web Forms application into a totally new MVC application. The expansion is both in terms of technology as well as business use case. The legacy application is a well done Database Driven Design DBDD. So for e.g. if you have different types of Employees like Operator, Supervisor, Store Keeper etc and you need to add a new type, you just go and add some rows in a couple of tables and voila, your UI automatically has everything to addupdate the new type of Employee. However the seperation of layers is not so good. p  pThe new project has two primary goals p  ul liExtensibility for currently and future pipeline requirementsli liPerformanceli ul  pI intend to create the new project replacing the Database Driven Design DBDD with a Domain Driven Design DDD keeping the Extensibility requirement in mind. However moving from a Database Driven Design to Domain Driven Design seems to inversely impact the Performance requirement if I compare it to the performance of the legacy DBDD application. In the legacy application any call for data from the UI would directly interact with the Database and any data would be returned in form of a DataReader or in some cases a DataSet. p  pNow with a strict DDD in place any call for data will be routed through the Business layer and the Data Access layer. This would mean each call would initialize a Business Object and a Data Access Object. A single UI page could need different types of data and this being a Web application each page could be requested by multiple users. Also a MVC Web application being stateless, each request would need initializing the business objects and data access objects each and every time. So it seems for an MVC stateless application the DBDD is preferrable to DDD for performance. p  pOr there a way in DDD to achieve both, Extensibility that DDD provides and performance that DBDD provides p

Any thoughts Thanks.p  pETA I should clarify that this is an SSRS 2008 R2 project, and codeDateBegincode and codeDateEndcode are defined in the report parameters as DateTime parameters. My current workaround involves setting the codeDateEndcode query parameter equal to the codeDateEndcode report parameter  1, but Im worried that someday Ill forget to document this properly and confuse the heck out of whomevers trying to maintain the report and it might be me. I emdontem want to pass string parameters, as suggested before.p

Negative 59504 pI have an activity that is themed as a dialog. I have seen that if the dialog is showing, and then I press the home button, and then using the task manager, restart the app, that dialog activity will be the activity that the app starts in, with no other activities available to go back to. That is, the activity that was running when I loaded the dialog activity is not running. So I just have this dialogthemed activity hovering over the desktop. That makes sense. p  pLooking over the Android activity lifecycle, the OS does remember the last activity and attempts to restart there. So I created all of the on methods in my activity onResume, onRestart, etc. What I found was really puzzling.

The code is as follows thanks to Prof. Bruce Hansen, whose code i modified p  precode Quantile Regression. qr.regress lt functiony,x beta lt crqyx,taucoefficients[1],rqyx,taucoefficients[2] beta   Threshold Estimation with one independent variable  constant. jointthresh lt functiony,x,q nnrowy kncolx eyxrqyx,taucoefficients[2]rqyx,taucoefficients[1] s0 lt dettee     n1 lt round.05nk n2 lt round.95nk qs lt sortq qs lt qs[n1n2] qs lt as.matrixuniqueqs qn lt nrowqs sn lt matrix0,qn,1 for r in 1qn    d lt qltqs[r]   xx lt xdmatrix1,1,k   xx lt xxxrqxxx,taucoefficients[2]rqxxx,taucoefficients[1]   ex lt exxrqexx,taucoefficients[2]rqexx,taucoefficients[1]   exw lt extauexlt0   sn[r] lt sumexw     r lt which.minsn smin lt sn[r]  qhat lt qs[r] d lt qltqhat x1 lt xdmatrix1,1,k x2 lt x1dmatrix1,1,k beta1 lt rqyx1,taucoefficients[2] beta2 lt rqyx2,taucoefficients[2] yhat lt x1beta1x2beta2 listyhatyhat,qhatqhat   Threshold Estimation with two independent variables  constant. jointthresh2 lt functiony,x,q n lt nrowy k lt ncolx eyx[,1]trqyx1,taucoefficients[3]x[,2]trqyx1,taucoefficients[2]x[,3]trqyx1,taucoefficients[3] s0 lt dettee     n1 lt round.05nk n2 lt round.95nk qs lt sortq qs lt qs[n1n2] qs lt as.matrixuniqueqs qn lt nrowqs sn lt matrix0,qn,1 for r in 1qn   d lt qltqs[r]   xx lt xdmatrix1,1,k   xx lt xx[,1]xrqx[,1]xx1,taucoefficients   ex lt exxqr.regresse,xx[2]xxqr.regresse,xx[1]   exw lt extauexlt0   sn[r] lt sumexw    r lt which.minsn smin lt sn[r] qhat lt qs[r] d lt qltqhat x1 lt xdmatrix1,1,k x2 lt x1dmatrix1,1,k beta1 lt rqyx11,taucoefficients[1] beta2 lt rqyx21,taucoefficients[3] c1 lt rqyx11,taucoefficients[2] c2 lt rqyx21,taucoefficients[2] yhat lt x1[,1]tbeta1x2[,3]tbeta2c1c2 listyhatyhat,qhatqhat   Threshold Reducedform eqn.  tau0.50  stqrthreshloop lt functionn,reps qhatas.vectorreps rhohatas.vectorreps kx lt 1  sig lt matrixc1,0.5,0.5,1,2,2   xlt matrixrnormnkx,n,kx q lt matrixrnormn,n,1  z2 lt cbindmatrix1,n,1,q fori in 1reps e lt matrixrnormn2,quantilernormn,tau,1,n,2cholsig z10.50.5xqlt01xqgt0e[,2]  y0.51z1qlt11.5z1qgt11z2[,2]e[,1]     out1 lt  jointthreshyz1,xx,qq     z1hatlt out1yhat     rhohat[i] lt out1qhat zhat lt cbindz1hat,z2  out2 lt jointthresh2yy,xzhat,qq qhat[i] lt out2qhat          Close for loop. listrhohatrhohat,qhatqhat    codepre  pYou can easily run it yourselves.

Im still relatively new at being involved with it in this project, and still discovering new parts as I try to solve this. If specifics or operation flow is needed Ill do my best to hunt down those parts.emp  pAnd upon refreshing, the chart which can be either Area, Bar, Column, or Line will cycle through the palette colors. For example, lets say 3 bars, currently redblueorange. Upon the refresh to update the chart with new data, the colors will change and cycle to whatever is next in the palette  lets say purpleyellowgreen. And it will continue cycling throughout the palette and therefor changing the chart and its legend for each refresh of data. This happens even without the custom palette.p  pUPDATEp  pLooking closer at the issues, the Line graph does not have the same behavior as the others. So it is only ColumnBarArea charts that have this problem. p

Stefan is right, EF really does this for you. I wasnt seen this because the references I was passing was loaded with codeAsNoTrackingcode. Only in this condition you will have a reference with ID and the foreing key field will be 0. As long as you pass a reference that is already on the context, it should work.p

Negative 59504 pHopefully someone can help. Our situation is this We have a master solution that contains multiple projects. All the projects are written in Visual studio 2010 using c under the 4.0 framework. One of these projects is an extended usercontrol object. We use this extended control in every one of the other projects within the solution. The way we do this is by referencing the extended usercontrol project. now to our problem and the cause for the question.p  pEvery project minus the extended usercontrol uses the ajaxtoolkit. We would like to remove all the individual toolkit files from each project and only have it in the extended usercontrol project. How do you go about accomplishing this I keep getting stuck on registering the assembly but I might me barking up the wrong tree with that.p

Negative 59504 pI am working on a django project that, along with having a database for its models and relations, writes to a log directory called codeactivitylogscode outside of the project directory to keep track of formatted user activities, one file for each user. This is an alternative filestructurebased solution to having a database table carry this information along, because this offloads some storage from the DB and is relatively easy to format and express such activities. Perhaps some of you may recommend storing this kind of data in the database, which is fine, but I still believe there is question from all of this that I need help answering.p  pThis django project has multiple apps that have an extensive test suite, one for each app. Additionally, there is a codelogging.pycode file that encapsulates the logging functionality writingreading activities tofrom log files, and so both the test cases within the test suites as well as the view functions and various other utility functions all utilize these logging functions in order to store these user activities and retrieve them based on model relationships to emulate a user notification system. Since the logging module takes care of this logging, it needs to know where to write to, and so we have a directory structure called codeactivitylogscode to which it writes user log files, creating one for a new user and deleting one for a user removed from the database. One of the newest changes we would like to make in this project is to create a separate logging directory for testing this logging functionality, something like codetestactivitylogscode, so that it would never be confused when writing to the test directory for test users or the regular activity log directory for real users.p  pMy problem is this at runtime, how can I tell the system, at whichever startpoint of execution whether it be from a view function call through the django test codeClientcode object, a test case, an actual HTTPrequest made via a URL, etc., when to look inside the codeactivitylogscode or the codetestactivitylogscode directory It solely depends on whether I am generating new information for a real user or a test user, but a User is a User in our system, and Im facing some trouble trying to tell these functions that call some logging functions to write to the test log directory vs. the regular one. For example, one approach I am trying is to pass a keyword argument kwarg to the logging functions so that they can be made aware of which directory to readwrite tofrom, like sop  pcodeself.assertTrueactivityhasbeenloggedACTIVITYACCOUNTCREATED, user.getprofile, usetestactivitylogdirectoryTrue  Truecodep  pthe kwarg called codeusetestactivitylogdirectoryTruecode will tell the logging function called codeactivityhasbeenloggedcode to read the test activity log directory. Unfortunately, apart from being a little inflexible but tolerable, this doesnt solve the situation where the django test codeclientcode object sends a GET or POST request via a URL to a view function that writes activities to log filesp  pcoderesponse  client.postproposematchurl, post Cant write to testlogdirectory if by default it writes to regular directorycodep  pHow do I let the client pass on this kwarg to those view functions I think that it should totally be possible to do this, but Im not sure if fiddling with these kwargs is the best way, or maybe create a global variable in the project settings file, but maybe that might cause some trouble with race conditions with a shared mutable variable.p  pYour help would be great. Thanks in advancep

Negative 59504 pSo I have a website where you can register and use a specific registration code. However I want to limit the total use of the registration code to only 20 times.

So if I have this input fieldbrp  precodeRegistration code ltinput typetext idregistrationcodegt codepre  pThen I just want to grey the field out, or make it unclickable when the limit has been reached. My idea on how to do this would be to have an ajax call for the text field, which calls a php file that checks the number of times it is used already. The way it would do that is, I would have a specific 1column table in my database that starts at the value of 0 and increments everytime the code is used. The php can retrieve that number and if its codelt20code then lock else, leave it open.p  pHowever, this seems like a very roundabout method, and I was hoping stack had some better ideas. Anyone know how to best deal with this kind of situation p

Negative 59504 pSo, to do much of anything useful with leaderboard data, one must first fetch an array of codeGKScorecodes from codeGKLeaderboardcode and then fetch the corresponding codeGKPlayercodes for each score. p  pOnce you have that, you might want to have a dictionary mapping the players to scores or the scores to players or codeplayerIDcodes to score codevaluecodes or some such. And itd be nice to set up such a dictionary using code[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsforKeys]code since we already have arrays. p  pThe question is are these arrays emguaranteedem to be in the same order i.e. is it safe to do the followingp  precodeGKLeaderboard leaderboard  [[GKLeaderboard alloc] init] [leaderboard loadScoresWithCompletionHandlerNSArray scores, NSError error      NSArray playerIDs  [scores valueForKeyplayerID]     [GKPlayer loadPlayersForIdentifiersplayerIDs withCompletionHandlerNSArray players, NSError error          self.scores  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsscores forKeysplayers]     ] ] codepre  pError handling and ARC safety ommitted for brevity.p  pI know code[scores valueForKeyplayerID]code will get me an array of codeplayerIDcodes in the same order as the scores  thats what codevalueForKeycode on an array is supposed to do. But does the completion handler from codeloadPlayerscode guarantee that the array of fetched player scores will be in the same order as the input Ive created a few sandbox accounts and done a few tests, and it appears that the sort order always matches, but thats no guarantee.p  pThe documentation doesnt say anything either way. It does say the array may contain partial results in the case of an error, in which case it obviously wont map to the input, but what about the noerror case Its pretty simple to sort both arrays on codeplayerIDcode, of course, but itd be a shame to have to spend time sorting an array if itll always be already sorted.p

Negative 59504 pIm just starting to learn rails, and after going through Michael Hartls Learn Rails by Example I decided to try to create my own simple application with some similar functionality. After making a few different migrations, and running them successfully, I tried to add a four column index to a table. When I ran bundle exec rake dbmigrate I got the errorp  precodeIndex name tempindexalteredeventsonuseridandmessageidanddateandaddressid       on table alteredevents is too long the limit is 64 characters codepre  pI looked up the cause of that error and changed my migration to usep  precodeaddindex events, [userid, messageid, date, addressid], unique gt true, name gt myindex codepre  pI then reran bundle exec rake dbmigrate and got the same error. I thought this was strange, and so I tried deleting the index line from the migration entirely, leaving the migration to simply create the new table. I tried again and was still getting the same error. I then deleted the migration file, tried generating an entirely new migration, and yet I still got the same error. p  pId really hate for this phantom migration to prevent me from moving on with this project. Does anyone know how I can make it forget about my past mistakes so that I can make some new ones p

Negative 59504 pI would like to serialize a nonstatic inner class in my java program.

Negative 59504 pIm attempting to create a simple animation in Java that displays a blue ball moving horizontally part way across a 500 x 500 window.  The ball is supposed to move at a rate of 1px30ms.  The problem is, is that the window is only being painted when the while loop exits and not during every iteration of the while loop as I intended.  This results in the blue ball being painted in its final location.  Could you please tell me what Im doing wrong here  Ive also tried executing this code on the EDT with the paintComponent method and got the same result.

The error was Setup Failed that I could see on the small LCD screen attached to the board. To install the driver I connect to the board via Telenet and CAB file is stored on SD card.

Negative 59504 pOk. Really quick question, Im probably just being thick. p  pIf you rightclick on a projects references folder then Manage NuGet Packages you can then install packages and they are automatically referenced by the project you clicked on. But then I want to add the same reference to other projects in the same solution. If you repeat previous but click on another project the only option is to uninstall the package since its already installed, what is the proper way to add an existing already installed NuGet package as a project reference Am I to add the reference using the normal dialog and browse to the dll in the packages folder Use one method to add the first reference then another for subsequent references That doesnt seem right. p

Negative 59504 pI am developing a web application using Dojo v1.8 and my target machine runs IE9 and Silverlight 5.1.20125.  In this web app, the user can select a tool from a toolbar at the top of the page that will open up in a content pane or an IFrame if it is an external tool below the toolbar only one tool can run at a time.p  pThe bug I am encountering is that one of the external tools that opens in an IFrame runs a Silverlight app, and if the user tries to select another tool, the new tool wont open and the Silverlight application stays there.  After checking the DOM Tree, all references to the Silverlight application have been wiped, and the new tool is there instead which is the desired behavior.p  pSo my question is, why is the Silverlight Application still being viewed even when it is gone from the DOM Tree, and is there a way to programmatically close it from Javascript  Also, I do NOT have access to the source code of the Silverlight Application.p
Negative 59504 pThe traditional answer to why is Javascript slower than native code is Because its interpreted. The problem with this claim is that interpretation is not a quality of the language itself. As a matter of fact, nowadays  most Javascript code is being JITed, still, this isnt even close to native speed.p  pWhat if we remove the interpretation factor from the equation and make Javascript AOT compiled Will it then match the performance of native code If yes, why isnt this widely done over the web If no, where is the performance bottleneck nowp  pIf the new bottleneck is DOM, what if we eliminate that too would a DOMless, compiled Javascript be as efficient as native code  If yes, why isnt this widely done over the web If no, where is the performance bottleneck nowp  pAfter stripping the DOM part and the interpretation part, the only big difference I can see between Javascript and CC is the fact that the former has dynamic types. Suppose we eliminate that too and end up with a DOMless,statically typed, aheadoftimecompiled Javascipt. how would that compare to native code If it would be as efficient, why isnt this widely used If not, where is the bottleneck now In this state, JavaScript is nearly identical to C.p  pOne might say that JIT is faster to load, but this wouldnt explain why AOT isnt being used for resourceintensive web apps such as 3d video games, where the AOT performance benefit is well worth the initial AOT compilation delay. and a significant game loading delay is present anywaysp  pa DOMless javascript would use WebGLCanvas to interface with the user. This currently requires minimal DOM, which defines the initial HTML5 Canvas, but this can theoretically be eliminated by revising the technology if its worth the performance benefit. Assume that DOMless WebGLCanvas is possible when answering.p  pEDIT I am talking about clientside compilation.p

If I set it globaly, the same thing happens.p  pI will be running thousands of threads at the same time when Im done, so I cant do manual solutions or readwrite to disk.p  pDoes anyone out there have experience with this I have been through the documentation and Google for quite a while, but cant seem to find a solution.p  pIn short I need to randomize a variable, use that variable throughout the thread group, and run this thread group in several simultaneous threads. The variable should have different randomized values in each different thread.p
Negative 59504 pSuppose I have a Python program that runs slow after profiliing and I have identified the bottleneck. One particular function from a 3rd party module I imported is particularly slow.p  pFor this particular case, I know that function is implemented in Python Used Eclipse and its easy to jump to the function definition. So I know that I can convert that function into Cython as a speedup option. If it is already implemented in C, there is no point in writing it in Cython.... p  pIf I dont have an IDE, what would be an easy option to determine this I know that I can go to the directory where the module is installed and infer that it is in C if the module is in .so.

Negative 59504 pOk so I have been testing out my own methods for changing the presented storyboards upon rotation and have been doing so with the codevoiddidRotateFromInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationfromInterfaceOrientationcode method to be assigning codeselfcode to another method which runs an ifelse statement which checks the orientation and loads the correct storyboard appropriately. The problem Im having is the checking if its in portrait mode or the else part of the statement. When I run the app in simulator and rotate the device to landscape, it loads the landscape storyboard like it should. But when I rotate the device back to portrait mode, it doesnt change back to the portrait storyboard. At first I thought the problem was that I wasnt dismissing the view controllers but after doing that, it still didnt work. I realized that it was the else part of the statement that wasnt working. I stuck ancodeNSLogPMCompletecode and still after running the app again and rotating to landscape and back, it still didnt show up in the log. Does anyone have any thoughts on whats wrong here I am operating this on the viewcontroller for the portrait storyboard assigned the view controller in the portrait storyboard the ViewController class.

Negative 59504 pIm writing this moreless in frustration  but who knows, maybe theres a way for this too...p  pI would like to analyze what happens with a function from ALSA, say codesndpcmreadicode for that purpose, lets say I have prepared a small codetestprogram.ccode, where I have thisp  precodevoid doCapture    ret  sndpcmreadihandle, buffer, periodsize  codepre  pThe problem with this function is that it eventually should hook into codesndpcmreadicode in the shared system library codeusrliblibasound.socode from there, I believe via codeioctlcode, it would somehow communicate to codesndpcmreadcode in the kernel module codelibmodulesuname rkernelsoundcoresndpcm.kocode  and that should ultimately talk to whatever code.kocode kernel module which is a driver for a particular soundcard. p  pNow, with the organization like above, I can do something likep  precodevalgrind toolcallgrind togglecollectdoCapture .testprogram codepre  p... and then codekcachegrind callgrind.out.12406code does indeed reveal a relationship between codesndpcmreadicode, codelibasound.socode and an codeioctlcode emI cannot get the same information to show with codecallgrindannotatecodeem  so that somewhat covers userspace but that is as far as it goes. Furthermore, it produces a emcall graphem, that is to say general callercallee relationships between functions possibly by a count of samplesticks each function has spent working as scheduled.p  pHowever, what I would like to get instead, is something like the output of the Linux codeftracecode tracer called codefunctiongraphcode, which provides a timestamped entry and exit of traced kernel functions... example from a hrefhttplwn.netArticles334530 relnofollowftrace add documentation for function graph tracer [LWN.net]ap  precode cat syskerneldebugtracingtrace  tracer functiongraph        TIME       CPU  DURATION                  FUNCTION CALLS                                                         2105.963678    0                     mutexunlock   2105.963682    0   5.715 us            mutexunlockslowpath  2105.963693    0  14.700 us           2105.963698    0                     dnotifyparent  codepre  pemNB newer codeftracecode documentation seems to strongnotstrong show a timestamp at first for the codefunctiongraphcode, only duration  but I think its still possible to modify thatemp  pWith codeftracecode, one can filter so one can only trace functions in a given kernel module  so in my case, I could add the functions of codesndpcm.kocode and whatever code.kocode module is the soundcard driver, and Id have whatever I find interesting in kernelspace covered. But then, I lose the link to the userspace program emunless I explicitly codeprintfcode to codesyskerneldebugtracingtracemarkercode, or do a codetraceprintkcode from userspace code.ccode filesemp  pUltimately, what Id like, is to have the possibility to specify an executable, possibly also library files and kernel modules  and obtain a timestamped function graph with indentednested entry and exit per function like codeftracecode provides. Are there any alternatives for something like this Note I can live without the function exits  but Id really like to have timestamped function entriesp  hr  pAs a PS it seems I actually found something that fits the description, which is the codefulltracecode applicationscriptp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comandreolifulltraceblobmasterREADME.md relnofollowfulltrace [andreoliGithub]ap  blockquote   pfulltrace traces the execution of an ELF program, providing as output a full trace of its userspace, library and kernel function calls. ...br   prerequisites the following kernel configuration options and their dependencies must be set as enabled y FTRACE, TRACINGSUPPORT, UPROBES, UPROBEEVENT, FUNCTIONGRAPHTRACER.p blockquote  pSounds perfect  but the problem is, Im on Ubuntu 11.04, and while this code2.6.38code kernel luckily has codeCONFIGFTRACEycode enabled  its codebootconfiguname rcode  doesnt even mention codeUPROBEScode  And since Id like to avoid doing kernel hacking, unfortunately I cannot use this script...p  pemBtw, if UPROBES were available, as far as I understand one sets a trace probe on a symbol address as obtained from say codeobjdump dcode, and output goes again to codesyskerneldebugtracingtracecode  so some custom solution would have been possible using UPROBES, even without the codefulltracecode scriptemp  pSo, to narrow down my question a bit  is there a solution, that would allow simultaneous userspace incl. shared libraries and kernelspace function graph tracing, but where codeUPROBEScode are not available in the kernel p

Negative 59504 pSo I created a project in netbeans and then added a new JFrame form this is my first gui app. I was wondering if there was any way to open the source code in another app like textedit and compile it using terminal javac blah.java, java blah. p  pI managed to create a .jar file clean and build and it works perfectly fine when I try to run it double click. Now I managed to find the .java file in src but when I compile it I receive 36 errors, which makes no sense since it built and ran perfectly fine and the jar file works. p  pEssentially I want to just take the source code not the entire project and compile it, for example on a computer that does not have netbeans using terminal. Can this be done p  pI would also like to emphasize that Im just a beginner. Thanksp

Negative 59504 pIm trying to lerp some items across a certain specified distance over a determined amount of time. Im using Time.DeltaTime to achieve framerate independence. However, when forcing lag with the help of a very performance intensive function drops the framerate to a theoretical 1015fps, my objects move MUCH slower than they should, even though they should move in constant time, independent of framerate they take about twice as long, 4s instead of 2s.p  pWhats even stranger is that the calculated FPS 1.0fTime.deltaTime stays constant approx. 66 FPS.

When you press back button you will get to a day view not to a week view, so a controller with weekview is skipped.p

Negative 59504 pIm using Django, Mezzanine, and Tastypie for a CMS Im building.  Tastypie exposes an API so that another app can consume data from the CMS.  I have many Django models with ImageFields and I would like to perform some specific actions in Tastypies ModelResource dehydrate method for all ImageFields, namely generate a few thumbnails.  Rather than overriding dehydrate in every single model resource and targeting the ImageFields by name, Id like to be able to automatically check if a resources corresponding model has any ImageFields, and if so, add the thumbnails to the resources bundle.  p  pIn summary, is there a way to iterate through a model resources corresponding models fields and check the type of each in the dehydrate methodp

Negative 59504 pI recently stumbled across the a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkjavaindexjsp141752.html relnofollowJava Communication APIa, which is a codejavaxcode package meant for serial communication in pure Java. I have heard of serial communication many times before, but I guess I dont understand what serial communication exactly means, or what it implies.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSerialcommunication relnofollowWikipediaap  blockquote   pIn telecommunication and computer science, serial communication is the process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus.p blockquote  pOK...so the Java Communication API allows me to readwrite data one bit at a time. strongBut what does that even meanstrong Cant I just do that on my own pseudocode herep  precodeString str  I want to send this bit by bit. byte[] strAsBytes  str.getBytes byte[] bits  new byte[strAsBytes.length  8]  For each byte we need 8 bits. forint i  0 i lt strAsBytes.length i      forint j  0 j lt 8 j           Something like this again this is just pseudocode.          Regardless, populate all elements in the bits array with the          bit in the position of the current byte.         bits[ij  j]  getBitstrAsBytes[i], j         Sends the array of bits over a network, maybe using Netty and TCP,  or something. Sends each bit one by one. networkManager.sendBitByBitbits   Retrieves the value of a bit at any position in a byte theByte. public byte getBitbyte theByte, int position      return theByte amp 0x01 ltlt pos   codepre  pI feel like the term serial communication implies something more than just sending one bit at a time. Does it mean that I can use it to readwrite from serial ports on a machine Something elsep  pI guess Im looking for a plainEnglish, layman explanation of what the broader term serial communication is and what types of things you can do with it, and then put that into context of the Java Communications API.

This second part wants five new specific methods added into the code which are boolean checks for rows, columns, blocks, and then return if they are true or false, in loops. checkAndPrintReport is supossed to also print one line for every single failed check of a row, failed check of a column and  failed check of a block.This is what I have so far.p  precode public boolean checkAndPrintReport        return false     public boolean isGoodRowintyRowParam         int sum  0   for  int x  0 x lt9 x            sum  sum  getCell x,yRowParam        return true       publicbooleanisGoodColumnintxColParam        int sum  0    for int y  0 y lt 9 y              sum  sum  getCell xColParam, y          return true       publicbooleanisGoodBlockintxBlockP,intyBlockP          int sum  0     for int x0 xlt3 x              for int y0 ylt3y                      sum  sum  getCell xBlockPx, yBlockPy                  return true      public boolean checkAll       codepre  pI think the main part confusing me right now is how exactly this differs from the code I had already created that checks for these things...so Im kind of confused as to whats being asked of me.p

Negative 59504 pstrongBackgroundproblem descriptionstrongp  pIm not even sure how to search for what I want to do. I have a queue of items that need to be processed, and I want PHP to check every 10 seconds or whatever increment to see if there is anything in the queue. If there is, it should begin processing it, but only if it isnt already processing another item so, when processing takes 30 seconds, for example, it wouldnt have more than one item being processed. I think I can hack an already processing flag with the existence of a lock file or something. p  pIm probably going to be using AWS SQS for the queue, and have multiple servers running in parallel p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pBasically, the user needs to queue up a bunch of work to be done asynchronously. So my question is, how do you schedule PHP to do queue checking I was looking at cronjobs, but those seem to only be capable of running every minute.p

Negative 59504 pI currently have a MVC 4 Application that uses windows authentication. I would like to be able to redirect the browser to a codeTimeoutcode view when the session ends.

Response.Redirect wont work. p  pI have tried using the codeOnActionExecutingcode method and this works great for strongNONAJAXstrong calls.

Negative 59504 pI recently updated my server to use SuPHP to increase security.p  pOne downside is that I used to be able to include files from my other domains hosted on my server using absolute paths to the file. This doesnt work anymore.p  pThe file in particular that I include from other domains is my functions file which is huge and used on all my websites. For the sake of maintainability, Ive been including a central file rather than uploading the file to each server every time I make changes.p  pI thought that saving the functions file as plain text and using filegetcontents across domains might be the right way to go. But apparently this doesnt work.p  pIs there a way to make it work p  pOr is there some other whizz bang function that can help me achieve my goalp  pCheers.p
Negative 59504 pI have a class hierarchy with a base class called codeEntityModelcode, and two classes codeInvestorModelcode and codeAgentModelcode that each inherit directly from it and add a few properties.

Negative 59504 pI have two columns in a file, and I want to automate summing both values per rowp  pfor examplep  precoderead write 5    6 read write 10   2 read write 23   44 codepre  pI want to then sum the read and write of each row.

Negative 59504 pI.m trying to implement a parallel mergesort. I use insertion sort as a basic method for sorting short slices, and I observe strange behaviour insertion sort randomly fails to sort correctly and leaves slices partially unsorted.

Negative 59504 pWe had an approach to use the srcset attribute to provide not only a different resolution but also a different image section within a responsive design. The alternative image url was associated with 320w in order to show only on smartphones in portrait mode.p  pSince Chrome is now supporting srcset it turns out that the browser always chooses the small image regardless of the actual viewport, probably due to its lower filesize. Does that mean we have to resort to other attributes and javascript againp

Negative 59504 pI was just wondering if I was comprehending clocks in the correct way, so far this is what I understand. p  pSo there is the clock generator which can either be a clock, a crystal oscillator, or a voltagecontrolled crystal oscillator. That clock generator creates the clock signal or clock pulse which I use interchangeably but I do understand that the pulse is the actual up and down whereas the signal is the transmission of energy carrying information. There are two pulses, one positive, one negative, and within each pulse there are two edges also positive and negative.     The measure of how long it takes for one positive or negative pulse to go back to another positive or negative pulse is known as the period T. And the measure of how long it takes for one clock cycle to occur per second is known as the frequency A clock cycle being one positive and one negative pulse occurring adjacently to each other  Now heres where I get confused. Are clock speed and frequency 2 different things Because I have it here that the clock speed would be the number of pulses per second, but if its the same as clock frequency, then my idea that its the amount of cycles per second is wrong. Either that or clock speed is the same as period...p

Negative 59504 pIm trying to invoke a modal WPF dialog from a dialog of a Win32 application on the press of a button but everytime after invoking the dialog, if I try to minimize and maximize the application or any other activity that makes the application lose focus, the dialog gets hidden behind the application.p  pIm calling the codedialog.Activatecode method to invoke the dialog activated and on top and it also seems modal in the sense that I cant interact with the Win32 dialog that invoked it nor the Win32 application itself. But once the app loses focus, the WPF dialog goes behind the application.p  pI could see the same problem on invoking the WPF dialog from a WPF application as well but am easily able to resolve it by setting the codedialog.Ownercode property of the WPF dialog to the dialog invoking it but Im not sure how I can do it from a Win32 application. Ive written a CCLI wrapper around my WPF dialog and Im using it in my Win32 app to invoke the WPF dialog. I thought of setting the Owner property through the wrapper but Im not sure how I can set a Win32 dialog window as the owner of a codeSystem.Windows.Windowcode dialog.p

Why the hell is Safari iOS sending a DNT header when the setting Settings  Safari  Do Not Track is not set Also, the Block Cookies, which is right below it, is set to Never.p  pAfter getting frustrated with that, I went to check on Chrome for iOS to see if that still doesnt work. IT WORKS From what I can tell, Id close all tabs, try again, close all tabs, then kill the browser, and it still works. Hoorayp  pNow, I need to figure out why iOS Safari is sending the DNT header...p

There were a few issues with the units type references and dependencies that kept it from building straight away, but I was able to correct those.p  pFrom a test form, I added code to consume the service, but I get an error which doesnt make sense.  The method is expecting a var of the type requestIVULoto being sent in, but the error would indicate otherwise.  I switched things up to a random service from xmethods.net, and was able to get a very simple one reto. checkit.chScriptsLotto.dllwsdlIgetNumbers functioning, which tells me that Im on the right path, but then another www. xmlme.comWSDailyNet.asmxWSDL that was slightly more complicated didnt and  generated the same error that I was receiving from the service I need to use.p  pI was able to get the service I need to use functioning in C with a service ref and 10 lines of code which is easy but is making Delphi all the more frustrating. Im considering a .net class lib exposed to com if this doesnt work.  Id rather do this natively in Delphi, but I fear Delphi 6 is just too old.p  pAny ideasp  pAs a side note, in C..p  precodeIvuLoto.IvuSvc.ivuLotoData ild  new IvuLoto.IvuSvc.ivuLotoData ild  client.requestIVULototxn  returns type ivuLotoData.  codepre  pErrorp  precode Debugger Exception Notification  Project TEST.exe raised exception class Exception with message The parameter is incorrect..

Negative 59504 pI have an expandablelistview that is backed by an adapter that handles loading data as the user scrolls down the list. As it scrolls, it dynamically calls the GetGroupView and GetChildView methods in the adapter to load content that is about to come into view, which is the default behavior. Very straightforward stuff.p  pThis expandablelistview has some rows that are more intensive to load, specifically it has multiple viewpagers. The scrolling down the screen becomes choppy when it gets to the rows containing viewpagers, due to the UI work necessary to setup and display them. However, once the user has scrolled to the bottom of the screen, scrolling back up and down again is fast and smooth, as the rows are now cached so dont need to be recreated.p  pWhat I would like to do is when the expandablelistview is created and bound to the adapter, somehow force it to load ALL of its rows, rather than just the top rows. That way there is no creating of views going on as the user scrolls down the screen, so the scrolling with be smooth. I dont see any method on the expandablelistview or the adapter to accomplish this, how can it be donep

Negative 59504 pWhile updating a record in the database, I get an error unknown column newTags.p  pThe update is a classic saveupdate procedure in Joomlas Backend. Before, I select an item in the listview for editing, afterwards I save the item in the edit view. The ony difference to all my other modelstables is that this one has a column called tags.p  pWhile updating the record, the system is trying to update all columns with the right values. But at the end, the system puts a new column called newTags to the update statement and tries to insert the same values like in my tagscolumn. Here, the update procedure fails with the error unknown column newTags. This would be right, because there is no column newTags.p  pWhat is going on herep  pUpdate to this post Joomla checks your data array before it will bind the array for saving. The admin legacy model checks, if there is a column called tags and when there is a column called tags it adds the column newTags to the table and fills it with the values of the tags column. You can find it in librarieslegacymodeladmin on line 1059p  precodeif emptydata[tags] ampamp data[tags][0]                        tablegtnewTags  data[tags]          codepre  pSo why does Joomla add a new column newTags to the Tableitem, while this will afterwards result in an error, because it is not possible to save this new virtual columnp

Negative 59504 pI am building a Rails app. The front end requests for data via AJAX to the Rails REST API. Im not sure if Im dealing with error handling appropriately.p  pMy Rails API controller calls codeMyServicecode for data. codeMyServicecode calls methods from codeExternalServicecode for data and to do some manipulations and filtering. codeExternalServicecode coderequirescode the codeExternalServiceAPIcode package and has a direct onetoone method mapping to the packages APIs. The codeExternalServiceAPIcode is just a Ruby wrapper around some REST calls. The reason I have codeExternalServicecode is because it takes a lot of object instantiations to call the codeExternalServiceAPIcode methods, and I could have codeMyServicecode, codeYourServicecode, codeTheirServicecode calling codeExternalServicecode for different types of data.p  pI have the following classesp  precodeclass ExternalService   require libexternalserviceapi    def getdataone     LibExternalServiceAPIGetDataOne.new   end    def getdatatwo     LibExternalServiceAPIGetDataTwo.new   end end  class MyServiceResponse   attraccessor body, error end  class MyService   def getdataonetwo     begin       externalservice  ExternalService.new       MyServiceResponse.new body gt [externalservice.getdataone, externalservice.getdatatwo]     rescue gt e       MyServiceResponse.new error gt e     end   end end  class APIResponse  include HashInitialize  attraccessor status, statuscode, body, errors end  class MyController lt ApplicationController   def getdataonetwo     begin       service  MyService.new       results  service.getdataonetwo       if results.body         response  APIResponse.newbody gt results.body, statuscode gt 200       else         response  APIResponse.newerrors gt [results.error], statuscode gt 400       end       render json response     rescue       render json APIResponse.newerrors gt [Something went wrong], statuscode gt 500     end   end end codepre  pThe codeExternalServiceAPIcode methods called in codeExternalServicecode methods will throw errors if there is invalid input. I want to just let the errors be thrown in codeExternalServicecode, coderescuecode them in codeMyServicecode, and codeMyServicecode will return codeMyServiceResponsecode objects.p  pThen my controller will just need to check on the codebodycode and codeerrorcode attributes that codeMyServicecode methods return, and return codeAPIResponsecode with the appropriate parameters. I think the controller methods still need to be wrapped in codebegincode and coderescuecode in order to catch unexpected errors and output a reasonable Something went wrong message.p  pIs this a reasonable approach to error handling Any advice and criticism on any aspect of my architecture is appreciatedp

Negative 59504 pi want to create an html page ,where on the left top side will be an image 400x200 ,exact below the image a rectangle divsame width with image and height 50px and exact on  the right of the image  another rectangle as a buttonsame height with image an width 50px . On the right size of the page i want 3 smaller rectangle divs as buttons100x50 one next to the other. How can i achieve this .I thought of creating two containers and put the image and the 2 divs to the one on the left and the rest 3 divs to the right. However something is missing, especially if the resolution is lower or i adjust the window the arrangement is awful .Which approach  is better when the resolution is smaller.

Negative 59504 pHello to everybody,p  pIve done a wcf service, that is published I can connect to it by browser and I can see the wsdl but when I try to consume it by a client program that Ive written, I obtain an An error occurred when verifying security for the message message. p  pSome detail consumer and server are on the same machine so this isnt the case of outofsync time between consumer and server, I use a self signed certificate, the service is put in a subsection of a greater solution, and it has a dedicated web.config that overrides the solution one.p  pWeb.config files are the same both on the service side than on consumer side Ive simply done a copy and paste from service to consumer file. Consumer uses basicHttpBinding and TransportWithMessageCredential connection and, after several attempts, even if Ive created a service reference to the service by Visual Studio tool, in the consumer code I specify again both the binding type than the endpoint address.p  pAs Ive already said, the service uses a self signed certificate, and Ive implemented a validation class to validate a non trusted certificate.p  pWhen I create the proxy object in my consumer class I dont get any error, I receive it only when I try to consume any method on my service. Ive set up the tracelog, but it doesnt seem to show any error, for what I can understandp  precodeltE2ETraceEvent xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.com200406E2ETraceEventgt ltSystem xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.com200406windowseventlogsystemgt     ltEventIDgt262165ltEventIDgt     ltTypegt3ltTypegt     ltSubType NameInformationgt0ltSubTypegt     ltLevelgt8ltLevelgt     ltTimeCreated SystemTime20141030T104132.4017455Z gt     ltSource NameSystem.ServiceModel gt     ltCorrelation ActivityID43c6480ee3fe4916b3a3efaa10881db5 gt     ltExecution ProcessNamew3wp ProcessID7004 ThreadID6 gt     ltChannel gt     ltComputergtWKR1007RltComputergt ltSystemgt ltApplicationDatagt     ltTraceDatagt         ltDataItemgt             ltTraceRecord xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.com200410E2ETraceEventTraceRecord SeverityInformationgt             ltTraceIdentifiergthttpmsdn.microsoft.comitITlibrarySystem.ServiceModel.Channels.RequestChannelReplyReceived.aspxltTraceIdentifiergt             ltDescriptiongtRicevuta risposta tramite il canale di richiestaltDescriptiongt             ltAppDomaingtLMW3SVC1ROOTPBEWSClientTest1130591392918713557ltAppDomaingt             ltSourcegtSystem.ServiceModel.Channels.BufferedMessage2733477ltSourcegt             ltExtendedData xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.com200608ServiceModelMessageTraceRecordgt                 ltMessagePropertiesgt                     ltEncodergttextxml charsetutf8ltEncodergt                     ltAllowOutputBatchinggtFalseltAllowOutputBatchinggt                     ltSecuritygt                         ltIsAnonymousgtFalseltIsAnonymousgt                         ltWindowsIdentityUsedgtFalseltWindowsIdentityUsedgt                     ltSecuritygt                 ltMessagePropertiesgt                 ltMessageHeadersgtltMessageHeadersgt             ltExtendedDatagt         ltTraceRecordgt     ltDataItemgt ltTraceDatagt codepre  p p  pOnly using Fiddler I can find an errorp  blockquote   pH1Errore server nellapplicazione PBEWSClientTest.H1               h2 iErrore durante la verifica della sicurezza del messaggio.i h2                              b Descrizione bEccezione non gestita durante lesecuzione della richiesta Web corrente.

Negative 59504 pReading chapter 20 of Ordeskys book on Scala, I found that inner classes are path dependant. Among other features, that implies that they can only be instantiated within the outer class or giving an outer class instance. p  pThe question arises I would like to implement an codestatic inner classcode in Scala but the author suggest that is not possible. I immediatelly thought of making the inner class lets call it codeInnercode a member of codeOutercodes companion object. p  pThe accepted answer of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1069987staticinnerclassesinscalathisa question seems to point towards that direction. But that drives to a problem codeInnercodes type inst codeOuterInnercode, I could try something likep  precodeobject Outer      class Inner extends OuterInner     codepre  pThis doesnt work however. Do you know a work arround for this I have the hunch that it could be done with abstract types but I am not sure.p  pNote that making codeInnercode an inner class of the companion objects is not exactly as having a nonpathdependant codeInnercode class because of its type.p

Negative 59504 pIm sending 1k data using TCPIP using FreeRTOS  LwiP.

Negative 59504 pI have written a code which solves Schrodinger equation in matrix representation. Hamiltonian is a square matrix and state vectors are onedimensional arrays. I was using numpy.matrix class and to solve coupled differential equations  ode from scipy.integratep  precodefrom scipy.integrate import ode import numpy as np codepre  pNow I have a problem because my matrices are far more larger than 10000x10000 and I experience total RAM memory usage when running two scripts at the same time. I was hoping that maybe sparsearrays from scipy would resolve my memory consumptions as Hamiltonian and other matrices I use have lot of zeros. I dont know if I would be able then to solve differential equations. Maybe there is other method for big data matrices with complex numbers.p  pI would like to add, I am using vectors in some moment of time to calculate mean values, so I get just a number at the end of calculations.p

Negative 59504 pIm looking for a way to stop a running job after it runs for a certain period of time and then restart.p  pIve read up on the spstopjob and from what I understand, this will stop the job once the current step it is running is completed. br  I cant use that because the job usually gets stuck on a step and needs to be stopped and restarted and then it finishes fine. p  pI already have a job that runs and sends out an alert for jobs that have been running longer than expected, I just need a way to stop and restart a particular job that will most likely not finish the current step.p  pUsing SQL Server 2014 Management Studiop  pThanksbr  Stevenp

Negative 59504 pIs there a magic incantation to keep gcc from complaining if the argument for the p format specifier is not a codevoidcode p  pA pragma would be ideal because I could put that in my standard compiler config header and so save the problem once and for all, instead of having to fiddle with projectmake files every time...p  pNormally I prefer the equivalent of Wall Wextra Wpedantic with all compilers because warnings on clean source often indicate a mistake on my part, or that the compiler may be losing the plot. However, I can see no possible benefit in cluttering my source code with superfluous casts C style no less, which I havent used in years, or the extralong hypercluttering ones, so this particular warning needs to go away.p  pemAddendum I know that typedefs andor templates can reduce the inline clutter to one letter and a pair of parens but they require extra outofline clutter. That stuff is noise, it reduces clarity and expressiveness instead of improving them.emp  pemHowever, it is my choice not to want this warning, and my goal to make it go away. It is rather silly anyway, since actually occurring problems with pointers near, far, based, whatever are orthogonal to the voidness of the pointer... And to preempt other potential objections, Im talking about plain data pointers, not function pointers, pointers to members, closures or whatnot. Should I ever need to port something to an oddball platform like Konrad Zuses Z1 then I can adapt the compiler config header to not suppress that warning on that particular platform...emp

Negative 59504 pIm needing to write a MIPS assembler in CC.  Before I start just writing some code, I think I should actually take some time and do some planning first.  There is about 15 MIPS instructions I need to account for, include J, but not JR.  The program needs to take in a file that has .text,.data, and .word sections along with labels, then output a file with the first line being in decimal with the number of instructions and the number of words of data.  The rest is the machine code encoded in hex. The final set of lines consists of hexadecimal values representing the initial values of the words in the data segment. I know Ill need to do 2 passes to first parse the labels and JUMP instruction. Basically Im just looking for advice on how to setup the data structures.  Should I do an array of strings that hold the OPCODE, the RS, RT, RD, etc... then convert that to hex somehow  Or is there a better way to do this from someone that has any adviceexperience  Thanks for your helpsuggestions p

Negative 59504 pThis subject has been targeted in many discussions and yet we still see new ones showing up. My scenario is as followsp  pA Java framework running on a Linux server where UTF8 is the default character encoding in the JVM. The framework consists of some services receiving Tibco RV messages to be processed. And some of these messages contains non ASCII characters and are sent from a Windows server and ISO88591 is the encoding used when message are created. Now, when the data are extracted from the Tib rv message, the problematic fields arrives as Java Objects and needs to be cast to Strings... And here I havent yet been able to extract ISO88591 Strings containing the non ASCII characters swedish aring,auml,ouml to UTF8 String in a proper way.  I have tried using the following methodsp  precodeString isoStreet  new Stringresponse.getstreet.toString.getBytesStandardCharsets.ISO88591,java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF8 codepre  pand Ive also tried using the encodersdecoders within java.nio package with no success.p  pWhats also interesting is that Im using PuttY to connect to server where services are hosten and running. And from there I have the possibility to make a direct Tibco rv request from the shell using the tibcorvsend client and it seems like I need to set the remote character set to ISO88591 in PuttY WindowTranslation before signing in to server and make that Tib rv request  when this is done those noneASCIIcharacters are shown correct in the response, no matter what encoding I set in remote Linux server. Using export LCALLenUS.UTF8 or export LCALLsvSE.iso88591 doesnt matter in this case... only what remote encoding  I set in PuttY...p  pThsi should imply that the response message seems OK and at least the shell is able to output proper characters. But when inside Java VM using Java services I guess the response fields are quietly pushed into Strings when debugging and viewing the response Object not wanting this conversion to Strings  within Watch view... not sure if you could follow me on this, if not I may try to be more clear if needed...p  pAny input on this problem, anyonep  pRegards Rp
Negative 59504 pSo I am trying to do a rather unique case of plotting it seems.

Do I need to change this to allow for the above time scale with multiple plotsp  precode    var myChart              type line,         title             text value over time  38 data points         ,         legend ,         tooltip ,         crosshairx,         plot              valueBox                  type max, min,                 placement top,                 visible  false                      ,         scaleX              label                  text Time,             ,              values  [ 1418947599.0,  1418947599.0,  1418947599.0,  1418947599.0,  1418947599.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0,  1418947600.0, ],             zooming  true,         ,         scaleY              label                  text Value             ,             zooming  true,         ,         series [                                                      text  sim data  raw value,                             values [0.31408204379961535, 0.3140820437996114, 0.3140820437996066, 0.3140820437996098, 0.3140820437996114, 0.31408204379960986, 0.314082043799613, 0.3140820437996122, 0.3140820437996098, 0.31408204379960664, 0.31408204379960825, 0.3140820437996067, 0.3140820437996083, 0.3140820437996114, 0.3140820437996098, 0.3140820437996154, 0.3140820437996114, 0.3140820437996123, 0.31408204379960586, 0.31408204379960913, 0.3140820437996099, 0.31408204379960825, 0.3140820437996098, 0.31408204379960664, 0.3140820437996098, 0.3140820437996114, 0.31408204379960825, 0.31408204379960986, 0.314082043799605, 0.3140820437996099, 0.31408204379960974, 0.3140820437996113, 0.31408204379961147, 0.31408204379960664, 0.3140820437996083, 0.31408204379960997, 0.3140820437996083, 0.31408204379961135]                         ,             ]           window.onloadfunction         zingchart.render             idmyChartDiv,             datamyChart,             height600,             width100               codepre

It will work just fine with .NET Framework 4, for as long as   you dont try to use CLRbased objects inside the database.p      ul   liKrzysztof Kozielczyk, Program Manager for SQL Server Expressli   ul blockquote  pAnd a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combsqlexpressarchive20091209sqlserverexpressandnet4.aspx relnofollowthisap  blockquote   pDoes all SQL Server Express functionality work with .NET Framework 4   Beta 2p      pNo, there are few features that still require .NET Framework 2.0 SP2   or 3.5 SP1. These features will be disabled if .NET Framework 4 Beta 2   is the only .NET Framework on the machine, but will start working the   moment .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 or 3.5 SP1 is installed.p      pThe list of features that dont work with .NET Framework 4 Beta 2p  precodeThe CLR data types geometry, geography, and hierarchyid.

In SQL   Server 2008 it is .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. So hosting .NET Framework 4   Beta 2 in SP1 would mean that we no longer host .NET Framework 3.5   SP1.

Negative 59504 pI was wondering how people handle form validation. Currently I have inputs that have isValid method on them and in the form component, I have to callp  precodeifthis.refs.username.isValid    ampamp this.refs.firstName.isValid    ampamp this.refs.lastName.isValid    ampamp this.refs.email.isValid    ampamp this.refs.password.isValid  codepre  pand thats just the beginning of the boilerplate.  If I could iterate through this.props.children and call isValid on them that would go a long way but I cant seem to make that work.p  pI also cant seem to iterate through this.refs and do it dynamically like that either.  I think. Pretty sure I tried that.p  pBut basically if I cant interrogate my components children and call methods on them then there is going to be a ton of boiler plate code in myeveryones app.p  pHas anyone dealt with this yetp  pThanks,p  pr p  pEDIT  some code to demonstrate what Ive triedp  precodeReact.Children.mapthis.props.children, function      var valid  child.isValid  codepre  pHere child has props, ref, and type.  This is helpful in general but not in my situation.  I want to have access to the actual instance so I can call an is valid function on it.p  pEDIT againp  pI appreciate the pointer to another answer, however, I dont feel it is a similar question.  Im not asking HOW to validate, Im asking whether anyone has found any good ways to wrap up validation.  The answer given in the other post is basically just like my example above, very verbose and repetitive,  they only show one field on a form so it doesnt look too bad but trust me after a couple of forms you are going to want to kill yourself.  p  pSo to clarify, Im asking, given the repetitive nature of asking every child component if they are in a valid state, and if not, what error do they have and then aggregating that information, is there a better way.  Perhaps if you could dynamically iterate through the children you could wrap the functionality up, but I have not been able to do that.p  pEDIT againp  pHere is a repo where I was messing with this stuff.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comreharikreactdemotreemastersrc relnofollowhttpsgithub.comreharikreactdemotreemastersrcap  pIts basically an editable display form or whatever.  You go to the page and can view the data but if you want to edit it click the button.  Edit the form and submit.  Thats just what I was playing with, it could just as easily be a RHForm that is used for all regular forms. p  pits pretty simple the RHInput validates on change and also has an IsValid method.  Currently the app.jsx has to call isValid on all its children.  If you look at RHEditableForm youll see that this would be a perfect place to dynamically call IsValid on whatever happens to be in there.  This could be reused by all forms and Id neverrarely have to write validation logic.  Also since this is where the OK button is it also seems like the correct place to put validation.p

Negative 59504 pIm using jQuery to help select a some matching checkbox elements in a form.

Because I want two possible behaviours depending on whether they click on the box or the label, I cannot use the codeltlabelgtcode tag. As a follow on from that, because of the independent selection, toggling is not viable.p  pThis seems to work for one cycle of ticks and unticks and then stops. If I inspect the checkbox element in Chrome, I can see that the checked attribute is being added and removed appropriately, but the browser view is no longer updated and the ticks do not show.p  pThis is consistent in the lastest versions of Chrome, Firefox and IE, so Im guessing that Im doing something wrongp

Negative 59504 pI feel this question is best started with a simplified version of the scenario.p  pServer A is connected to the public internet. Server B is in a private Network and uses network address translation to connect to the internet. I own both servers and can edit the software on them. The ip addresses of the servers and the nat router are known to me.p  pUsing Winsock, I need to create a connection between them. I know enough about winsock for this to be trivial if the connection is started from server B, but I need server A to start the connection.p  pI want to avoid using additional libraries if possible as it would appear to me that I only need to figure out what ip and port server A needs to use when starting the connection.p  pWhat additional information do I require, How do I acquire it, and How do I act upon the information.p  pemnote I have investigated other similar questions, but none of them addressed this situation. I am  not sure if this should have been asked on server fault or another site, but if so please say which one before flagging as off topic instead of closing the question wordlessly.emp

Negative 59504 pAs a hobby, Im making a 2D RPG in XNA and C. I have a class called ObjectiveData. Its only member is a string called objectiveID. Derived from this are various other classes GatherItemsObjectiveData, SpeakToNPCObjectiveData, etc  all of them are suppose to store their own objective data related to that particular objective gatherItemsObjectiveData would hold details on which item to collect and how many, etc. The only commonality between them is objectiveID, hence why its in the parent class.p  pI had XML serialization of this working when each of the derived classes had their own objectiveID variable, but I want it to be in the parent class so that I can get the objectiveID without knowing what derived class it is, etc. When I made the switch to putting objectiveID in the parent, it no longer works says XMl element objective not found.

Negative 59504 pIm looking to create a macro for my office. This macro imports data from websites using the  codeWith ActiveSheet.QueryTables.AddConnectioncode code. p  pThe issue is that anyone who uses this macro will need to sign into the website I am trying to reach. Since I am using the Query command, the query requires the login, and not the IE object. p  pRight now, I have people go to the data ribbon and clicking from web to load the website up and sign in that way, then exiting it and running the macro. This allows the Query to reach the login cookies and the code runs fine. I need a way to streamline this so its not so complicated.p  pRight now, I have a userbox that loads when the worksheet is opened that allows users to enter in their user login and password. Then this userbox saves that information in a different sheet. p  pIm looking for a way to use the information they entered to login to the query import because having users go to the data ribbon is just a pain in the butt for everybody and just makes my code look sloppy. Is there a way to login to a query website automatically p  pEven if I automate the login from an IE Application, the query still asks for a login. This makes me think that the cookies stored from IE and the query language are separate. p

Negative 59504 pI ran into a substantial problem with the way Netbeans packages up Java programs into native Mac Apps For those who arent familiar, Netbeans can bundle your Jar file with a JRE so you have a completely selfcontained App. Clients dont even have to have Java on their computers to run it. The whole process is explained well a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30966007createanativebundleforajavafxapplicationthathasapreloader30983359noredirect1comment5000462330983359herea. p  pThe problem I found was that the apps Netbeans produces completely ignore JavaFX Preloaders. I think its because of the slimmed down JRE that gets added in. I couldnt find any solutions online and wanted to post one here for anyone who runs into the same issue.p

Negative 59504 pThis is a homework questionp  pI have an codeRDDcode which is a collection os tuples. I also have function which returns a dictionary from each input tuple. Somehow, the opposite of reduce function.p  pWith map, I can easily go from a codeRDDcode of tuples to a codeRDDcode of dictionaries. But, since a dictionary is a collection of key, value pairs, I would like to convert the codeRDDcode of dictionaries into an codeRDDcode of key, value tuples with each dictionary contents.p  pThat way, if my codeRDDcode contains 10 tuples, then I get an codeRDDcode containing 10 dictionaries with 5 elements for example, and finally I get an codeRDDcode of 50 tuples.p  pI assume this has to be possible but, how Maybe the problem is that I dont know how this operation is called in Englishp

Negative 59504 pLets say you have a sort of a news stand kiosk app where you offer interactive magazines for download. Our newer mags are HTML5based where we download the individual issues compressed from the server, decompress them and launch them in a inappbrowser modal window. Our older mags are basically individual native apps. p  pCould the older native mags IPAs also be downloaded from within the kiosk and launched somehow Is this technically possible and allowed at the same time Either launching it as a separate processapp or inline i.e. somehow from within the context of a kiosk application Is that even possible launching an app within an appp  pOf course if needed to support the process we could reexport all older apps with correct provisioning, etc. and they inapps would be made available for the review process. Just looking for options on whats technically possible currently.p  pThank youp

Negative 59504 pIve built 2 websites using opencart 2 many more on Opencart 1 and both are setup to take Sagepay Server payments, But its now come to light that both sites Sagepay payments are failing when Sagepay tries to talk back to opencart to give the green light. This means no failure email notification is sent to the store owner, and the sale is cancelled at Sagepay as you can imagine both store owners are not happy. I contacted Sagepay to see what was happening and they told me the payments were failing with the below Error, but as far as Sagepay was concerned the payments had passed all tests, but because the calling website could not send the correct response back to Sagepay, they had to cancel the transactionsp  pLooking at how Sagepay works, it seams sagepay returns autorisation to Opencart and then opencart has to say whether its going to accept the payment based upon what is being sent, and it seams this is where opencart 2 is failing to respond correctlyp  pIs this yet another OC2 bug p  pHas anyone come across this and how do I put this right p  pOne site is on OC 2.0.2.0 and the other one is 2.0.3.1 Everything is setup correctly in payment module and IP Address logged with sagepay etc.., its just a problem after payment authorisation.p  blockquote   pTransaction completed but Vendor systems returned INVALID or ERROR in   response to notification POST. Transaction CANCELLED by the Vendor.p blockquote  pThis is a really big problem, and not sure how to go about fixing this, as Opencart 2 is meant to be able to take sagepay payments out of the box, once a few settings are added in the admin section, but it seams its not setup correctly to do so.. I cant believe no one else has come across thisp

Negative 59504 pI have a table view in my app where the cells contain only one textview per cell. These textviews are populated with text stored in the NSUserDefaults. The user can change the text and than it is saved again. The text arraythe text which is used to populate the textviews from NSUserDefaults is loaded at codeviewDidLoadcode. However, the text of the textviews in the cells are set in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode. The problem is that codecellForRowAtIndexPathcodeis called when ever the user scrolls the tableview so if heshe is editing one of the textViews and scrolls while still typing, everything disappears because codecellForRowAtIndexPathcodeis called and the textViews texts are set from the saved data which was loaded on codeviewDidLoadcode. p  pSo..I figured maybe letting codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode change the text of textviews only onceat app start will solve the problem but as it turns out codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode is called individually for every cell. So it was working but only loaded the text for the first cells textView because I only let codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode do that once.p  pstrongMy question isstrong How can I let codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode change the textViews texts of all the cells only when viewDidLoad is called as well  Or can I set the textViews text for each cell from the codeviewDidLoadcode method As that would clearly solve the problem.p

Negative 59504 pI have the 3D coordinates of a set of vertices as well as the list of edges connecting them. I would like to identify the sets of vertices which form the faces of the object. p  pIve tried treating the object like a graph and using Networkx to find the basis cycles of this graph, however I dont think the function cyclebasis takes into account the coordinates of the points. The Networkx graphs dont seem to have a coordinate system for their vertices anyway.p  pAs far as I can tell, knowing only the nodes and their connectivity does not allow you to necessarily find the correct cycles or faces as there are multiple embeddings of a single connectivity matrix. As a result the coordinates of the vertices must be known to find the specific faces of a particular shape not just the connectivity of the vertices that define the shape. However I cannot find an algorithm that incorporates 3D coordinates in finding the basis cycles which in turn define the faces of a graph.p  pUPDATE I did some more searching and this question is almost what I need   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20722933howcaniconstructalistoffacesfromalistofedgeswithconsistentvertex2072349820723498How can I construct a list of faces from a list of edges, with consistent vertex orderinga  the differences are that my faces are not necessarily triangular and there is no system for vertex numbering.    p

Negative 59504 pI have a mobile app heavily associated with maps, GPS, location etc.p  pCurrently Im sending real time location data to server as regular Json Strings..., and in the server Im converting it to my custom geo objects, querying geo spatial database PostGis etc.. Then backwards Im converting the results to strings and send them back to client as regular Json. Usually the client needs this results to display them to the user, so its convenient that they are already strings.p  pMy question is what can I benefit from working with Geo Json format instead Its clear that it enables offline mode using SpatiaLite etc. But what else What about all the conversions Im using fromto strings of geo locations Currently I have some very simple custom geo objects location object etc.. Can I benefit here Note that in the end its good for me have the results as strings for the user, and for now offline mode irrelevant.p  pIs there a rule of thumb that if you are locationmap app  its best practise to use geo Json and not regular Jsonp  pThanks,p

Negative 59504 pI have to plot different graphics with subplot within a figure but I do not know how many will be plotted because it depends on the data introduced by the user for loop. In order to plot a subplot I need to know the number of columns and rows. Is there any option in matlab that matlab configures the best number of columns and rows to display plots knowing the total subplots to do I mean subplota,b,c  best a,b combination knowing c.p  pNow I ask to the user to introduce number of columns and rows but its a bit uncomfortable. Maybe an algorithm to take a decomposition of the total subplots into the 2 most equals factors should work but I think its quite difficult to code that. If its too complex Ill follow with my way but I was curious about it.p

Child elements inherit the BindingGroup from their parent elements, just as with any other inheritable property. A binding on a descendent element is added to a BindingGroup if one of the following situations occursp      pThe bindings source and the DataContext of the element that has the BindingGroup are the same object and the BindingGroupName property is not set.p      pThe BindingGroupName property of the binding is equal to the Name of the BindingGroup and they are not explicitly set to null.p blockquote  pIve checked that that image indeed has the same value of BindingGroup property as the window.

Negative 59504 pNewb to Xcode running 6.4, following very good tutorial and just at early stages.  Was linking buttons to screens using the push drag and drop.

Negative 59504 pI have run into a definite issue with NSString and boundingRectWithSize.p  pOn an iOS 8 iPhone, everything is sound and well. It calculates the correct size of a string when rendered with a font at a certain size. With a iOS 9 GM seed iPhone, the width is always maxed out at 320, consistently. If the string is short, below 320 points, that will be correctly and consistently reported as on an iOS 8 device, but when an iOS 8 device reports a width beyond 320, the iOS 9 device always reports a width of 320.p  pThe app is compiled using Xcode 6.4, ie using iOS 8 SDK. The OS I use is OS X El Capitan GM seed. I have emheardem, that using Xcode 6 on El Capitan is not really recommended. The recommended version of Xcode for El Capitan is Xcode 7. I cannot use Xcode 7 yet but will try it shortly, just to try... because of business reasons. strongUPDATE I just tried compiling using Xcode 7 and SDK 9.0  the widths are still maxed out at 320. The Xcode andor SDK version is not the issue. iOS 9.0 is either bugged here or just behaves differently strongp  pAnyone ran into the issue If I find no one else, I guess I will report this bug I suspect it is a bug. Or just inconsistent behaviour which I really dont think Apple meant without giving some kind of deprecation warning to Apple.p

Negative 59504 pHi to all experts over here My question is all about jquery. I am using strongdraggable dropabblestrong methods.I have a droppable divparent . And on drag and drop of a element which is a div itself to left of droppable div parent div , elements gets appended to left ...if dropped close to right it appends to right.p  pFor this  I am using left right positioning for egleft30px , right40px. I hv used float right left too.p  pstrongUpto here its working perfectly.strongp  pNow I want to implement sorting too...I mean the elements within the droppable container parent div should sort too. For which I have used strongui.sortablestrong . But its not working since the DOM elements have a fixed position so it does not sort.p  pNow I am tried changing the css of DOM elements on first attempt to sortp  precode  .parent .sortable         placeholder highlight,         stopfunctionevent,ui         .parent.childrendiv.cssfloat,left         .parent.childrendiv.cssposition,relative         .parent.childrendiv.cssright,         .parent.childrendiv.cssleft,            codepre  pThe Above code does not sort in the first attempt but rearranges the DOM elements according to the DOM position as in code .After the First attempt it changes the css and it sorts perfectly. I want sorting on first attempt itself without rearranging of child divsp  pstrongNoticestrong sortable is not working since i have given the dom positions..or float values.... Please tell me if anyone knows a solution.p

Negative 59504 pI have a  list of numbers eg.p  ul li120li li233li li197li li400li li276li li356li li121li ul  pFor the purpose of my program these numbers have to be arranged in two sets. Based on what numbers are in the set the program calculates the efficiency of each set. It then combines the efficiency quotients for the combination of the two sets. The two sets and its efficiency quotient then gets saved in an array.p  pThe goal is to find the combination of sets where both the sets have the highest efficiency.p  pMy problem At the moment, i cant seem to wrap my head around the algorithm needed to check every possible set combination. As far as i can get it seems to need a form of recursion.p  pIf you need more information let me know Thanks in advancep
