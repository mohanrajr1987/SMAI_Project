Positive 39308 pI am labeling the vertices of latitudelongitude polylines.  I label them, as below.  They are the smallest I can find.

Is there a practical, alternate solution   p  precode      lngLabels.pushnew google.maps.Marker             mapmap,             positionlatLng,             icon  urlhttpschart.googleapis.comchart             chstdbubbletextsmallampchldbb              qtrLatLng             FFFFFF000000,                 anchornew google.maps.Point0,42                       codepre

Positive 39308 pI am a complete novice for this, but am trying to get a searchable map to work with kml layers that can be toggled on and off.  I currently only have two kml layers to work with, but will be adding more as soon as I can get this to work.  The idea is to be able to search locations or business names and utilize the layers to determine which units are needed to respond which fire station, ambulance, etc.  I have found a number of similar questions that have been answered, but have been unable to make the changes work.

I want to create a SqlConnection and then check that connection without opening a database, cause at that point I dont know yet where will I connect to.

Negative 39308 pGWT gets locale from either the  locale property or the locale query string.  If neither is specified, it uses the default ie enUS locale.p  pWhy doesnt it get it from the browser settingsp  pIt seems the only solution to this is to replace your static html launch page with soemthing like a JSP that reads the browser locales and sets the  locale or redirects using the query string.

Negative 39308 pIve stumbled across a hrefhttpblog.getpaint.net20081206afluentapproachtocparametervalidation relnofollowthis great posta about validating parameters in C, and now I wonder how to implement something similar in C. The main thing I like about this stuff is that is does not cost anything until the first validation fails, as the codeBegincode function returns codenullcode, and the other functions check for this.p  pObviously, I can achieve something similar in C using codeValidate v  0 IsNotNullv, ....IsInRangev, ...code and have each of them pass on the codevcode pointer, plus return a proxy object for which I duplicate all functions.p  pNow I wonder whether there is a similar way to achieve this without temporary objects, until the first validation fails. Though Id guess that allocating something like a codestdvectorcode on the stack should be for free is this actually true Id suspect an empty vector does no allocations on the heap, rightp

Negative 39308 pOur current project at work is a new MVC web site that will use a WCF service primarily to access a 3rd party billing system via a web service as well as a small SQL database for user personalization.  The WCF service uses nHibernate for the SQL database.p  pWed like to implement some sort of web farm for load balancing as well as failover and maintenance.  Im trying to decide the best way to handle nHibernates caching and database concurrency if there are multiple WCF services running.p  pSome scenarios Ive been thinking about...p  p1  Multiple IIS servers, one WCF server.  With this setup, the WCF server would be a single point of failure, but there would be no issues with nHibernate caching or database concurrency.p  p2  Multiple IIS servers, each with its own WCF service.  This removes a single point of failure, but now nHibernate on one machine would not know about database changes done by another machine.p  pSome solutions to number 2 would be to use an IStatelessSession so were not doing any caching and nHibernate is always fetching directly from the database.  This might be the most feasible as our personalization database has very few objects in it.  Im also considering a 2ndlevel cache such as memcached or Velocity, but it may be overkill for this system.p  pIm putting this out there to see if anyone has experience doing this sort of architecture and to get some ideas for a solution.  Thanksp

As I find myself trying to minimize AJAX requests to the server, Ive got an awkward mix of caching and spaghetti code developing.

Negative 39308 pI have a question regarding JavaScript and methods by which its code can be run. As we know, there is some JavaScript code embedded in  tags and it runs natively within browser window  thats quite common and thats how the web pages currently work.p  pIf we want interaction out of the box with the web page we are surfing, we must use tool such as GreaseMonkey and write our UserScripts that allow us to change page behavior to our desired one. This still needs us to open browser window and visit our target.p  pThe question is can we somehow run JavaScript code on a certain page without even opening browser window I mean, in an ideal solution there would be a commandline tool thatd allow us to callp  precode.clibrowser httpgoogle.com userscript.js codepre  pIn which script, for example, we could run some AJAX code to fetch data coming from queries and pass it to some other PHP script thats save it to database.p  pI think that this question simplifies to strongare there any tools like commandline browser with JavaScript enginestrong I know, that it may sound strange, but I am curious just because of the idea I have in my mind.p

Negative 39308 pRecently I participated in designing amp writing of an application which my team was given complete requirements and had to basically design and code it  it was about automation of 3rd party handwriting recognition platform to interop with a couple of our systems. Now a few months after the customer called with what seemed to be at first glance a minor issue, but after investigating it turns out that the whole application requires redesign just to fix this inaccuracy its easier to redesign then patched. p  pI personally dont think the application was particularly badly designed by any of this points mentioned on  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1056199indicationsofpossiblypoordesign10562191056219this threada but just that there was way to many small unknowns for us and looks like have now accumulated into a major design flaw  something we  basically failed to see. All those small factors in the design stage seemed be insignificant amp ignorable so we thought we are doing ok. Now with the problem occurred it it seems silly we couldnt spot it at design time but I guess we ignored some small details amp nuances which turned out to be significant after all.p  pSo is there any approach to take when you are entering the design stage of an application the you are not too familiar with but its design falsely seems to be more or less straight forward create tables, write BOs, write UI etc so that you can increase you chance to foresee this type of pitfalls in the implementation stage  or at least certainly before customer deployment  p  pPS Sometimes we hire experts to help like mathematician one time, or geographical guy another but who can help us incorporate a third party platform into ours except usp

Negative 39308 pI have a class library that keeps systemwide configuration data in the registry HKLMSoftwareXXX. This library is used in various applications services, windows forms, web apps, console apps on various versions of Windows XP, 2003, 7, 2008 R2. Because of this, the identity of the app is not consistent and may not even be a member of the machines Administrators group. So Ive created an AD domain admin user and do impersonation to gain write access to the registry. This works perfectly in XP2003, but not in UACenabled systems 72008R2. It is my understanding that only interactive logins split the tokens which would imply that noninteractive logins service identities, app pool identities, etc. do not. I cant find anything to confirm that, but working from that assumption, the impersonation Im doing should work.p  pI wrote a wrapper class to do the impersonation using native LogonUser network logontype, default provider and DuplicateTokenEx impersonation, primary token then WindowsIdentity.Impersonate. I get a reference to my root keyp  precodeusing ECR.Impersonator imp  new ECR.ImpersonatorXXX, XXX, XXX      root  Registry.LocalMachine.CreateSubKeySOFTWAREXXX, RegistryKeyPermissionCheck.ReadWriteSubTree  codepre  pAccording to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.win32.registrykeypermissioncheck28VS.9029.aspxMSDNa, by using ReadWriteSubTree, this should be the ONLY time a security check is done.

So I thought that I would only need to do the costly impersonation one time  getting the reference to my root key.p  pI can write values to my root key just finep  precoderoot.SetValuecachedDate, value.ToBinary, RegistryValueKind.QWord  codepre  pbut when I createopen a subkey with ReadWriteSubTreep  precodeRegistryKey key  root.CreateSubKeyXXX, RegistryKeyPermissionCheck.ReadWriteSubTree codepre  pit bombs with codeAccess to the registry key HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREXXXXXX is deniedcode.p  pWhile Im curious why a security check is done when MSDN says it shouldnt, my question is how can I get elevated permissions via impersonation for applications that may not be running under a interactive loginp

Negative 39308 pThis is a weird bug, and Im not even sure how to begin figuring out whats going on.  p  pWe are using Cake 1.3.8 with our sessions in the database.  I am not using ACL or any other access control.  If we navigate into the application and click around a bit, and then rapidly click the browser back button twice Ive tried in Firefox and Chrome the user is logged out more often than not and receives the error message You are not authorized to access that location.p  pAll of my searches thus far have involved people wanting to make the page inaccessible if a user logged out and then used the back button.  Im not seeing anything reported with regards to the issue Im seeing.p  pDoes anybody know if this is a Cake issue or have any thoughts on debugging what is going wrongp  pUpdate I found where the problem is.

Negative 39308 pI have two buttons positioned horizontally next to each other and want to limit the width of the buttons when the screen resolution goes up. For mdpi, the two buttons should be equal length and take up the entire width of the screen.

Negative 39308 pI need to provide context sensitive help in my GWT application. For this every GWT view will have many help links each of which will open a dialog box with appropriate help text different for each link.

What I need is to have many Anchor elements in my UI binder xml file and all the anchors should have the same click listener. The click listener will decide based on some parameter which help text to display in the dialog box.p  pI tried to use Hyperlink element with different history tokens for all links, but it changes the history which is not desirable.

Now, When the screen is shown at first time, by default Search is shown. To trigger the processing of the ListActivity, the user has to select the Search again. This time, on ItemSelected callback is not called.

It accepted arguments likep  precodepublic void methodint a[], int xx, int yy  ... codepre  pIt did things like ..p  precodea[xxyy2]  xx codepre  p... and ...p  precodeif a[xxyy2] gt j    methoda, xx, yy  codepre  p... and much more complex than that.p  pI know thats not much to go on, but can someone point me in the right direction  What kind of mathematical or encryption functions would look like this  Where should I go or what should I search forp  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp  pRobp  pUPDATE I see Im being downvoted for this question.  Sorry I couldnt provide more detail.  My question was really about pointing me in the general subject area that such a method would be for.  But thanks to all the comments, they were very useful.  If some of you wrote your comments as answers, Id have been happy to mark one of the helpful ones as correct.p

Payout table comes from abroad so we do not have any control over it. This leaves us with a problem that we cant join the two tables based on record ID field, that is one problem which we cant solved. We therefore join based on Account, SupplierID 2nd and 3rd column. This creates a problem that it creates possibly many to many relationship. But we filter our records if they are active and we use a second filter on payout table when the payout was created. Payout are created months to month. There are two problems with this in my viewp  ol liThe query takes quite a bit of time to complete could be inefficientli liThere are certain duplicates that are removed which should not be removed. Example is record 6 and 8 in payout table. What happened here is, we got a customer, then the customer cancelled then he got him back. In this case 50, 50 and 50. Again all values are valid and must show in the report for audit purposes. Currently only one 50 is shown, the other is lost. There are a couple of other problems within the report that comes once in a while.li ol  pHere is the query. It uses groups by to remove duplicates. I would like to have an advance query which outperforms and which does takes into account that no record in PayOut table is duplicated as long as they come up in the month of the report.p  pHere is our current queryp  precode Supplied  to Store Procedure   RepID  the person for whome payout is calculated Month  of payment date year   year of payment date  select distinct  A.col1,  A.col2, ... A.col10,  B.col2,  B.Col2,  B.Amount  this is the important column, portion of which goes to Rep  from records A JOIN payout B  on A.Supplier  B.Supplier AND A.Account  B.Account where datepartmm, B.datecreated  Month  parameter to stored procedure    and datepartyyyy, B.datecreated  Year   and A.[rep ID]  RepID  parameter to SP  group by col1,col2,col3,....col10 order by customerName codepre  pIs this query optimum Can I improve it using CROSS APPLY or WHERE EXISTs that will make it faster as well as remove the duplicate problemp  pNote that this query is used to get payout of a rep. Hence every record has repid field who it is assigned to. Ideally I would like to use Select WHERE Exist query.p
Negative 39308 pWe have an application that creates several threads using the pthread library.  As we want only the main process to handle certain signals all the pthreads have SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP blocked.  In one of our pthreads we restart the network usingp  precodesystemetcinit.dnetworking restart codepre  pIt looks like the system call will fork another child process that inherits the signal mask of the pthread.  The problem is that it restarts the ssh daemon and the newly created ssh daemon has inherited the signal mask from our pthread SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP being blocked.  The result being future network restarts taking a long time as it fails to send the SIGTERM and waits for a timeout before sending SIGKILL. My question is what is the best way of restarting the network from a multithreaded application like ours.  Is there a way of telling init to restart a service I thought of unblocking signals before calling system, but then if someone terminates our application during this time our main signal handler may not get called.p  pWe are running a debian linux distribution running on an embedded ARM board.

Negative 39308 pIm coding my first app in XCode 4.2 supporting iOS 4.x through the current releases. To support iOS 4.0, Im not using Storyboard feature and also using codeunsafeunretainedcode for weak references. I have AppDelegate files .h and .m along with several view controllers with codeUITabBarControllercode. In my first view controller, in the codeviewDidLoadcode method, I initialize two codeNSDictionariescode and also start a timer with 1 sec interval. In the selector method, I have to pickup a random number between 0 and 7 to pick a corresponding value in both the dictionaries. The dictionaries are used only in the first view controller and not anywhere. p  pMy first question is p  ol liwhere do I load those two dictionaries  in the AppDelegate codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode method or in the first view controllers codeviewDidLoadcode method li liI also wanted to support iPad. If thats the case, do I create a  common class library to support iPhoneiPodiPad. If that is the recommended way, can I move the common functionality to the AppDelegate .m file insteadli ol  pPlease advise.p
Negative 39308 pThere are a number of posts showing how to do it by hand  which, incidentally, Ive done before  but I was surprised to find no Nuget package to add this functionality to your WCF project in a similar fashion to the way you can add Unity to an MVC3 project with emUnity.MVC3em.  I searched the online Nuget package source directory but came up with nothing.  If I missed something obvious, Id appreciate it if youd point me in the right direction.p

Negative 39308 pI am editing Java code which stores data in a YAML file, but I need to make it use MySQL instead, but Im not sure how to go about doing this. The code makes request to read and write data such as codeSQLsettop.middle.nameleaf, Joecode or codeSQLgettop.middle.ageleafcode. These functions are defined by me. This would be simple with YAML, but Im not sure how to implement this with SQL. Thanks in advance. Another thing is that if codetop.middlecode was set to null then codetop.middle.nameleafcode would be removed, like it would in YAML.p

Negative 39308 pSorry for the rather ambiguous title but Im developing a Sencha Touch mobile app and have built a RESTbased WCF web service to supply the data and need to find out the best way to handle user logins and keeping their session alive throughout the app. p  pNow because Im needing to use JSONP for connecting with the web service this limits the options for authentication and session handling. I could just save the users credentials in local storage in the app and pass them with every call the service but this cant be the best solution. Some have mentioned passing the credentials to a login method on the web service and passing back a sessionid which is then sent with each further call. However Im not sure how to create the session in the first place using WCF and how to keep it alive using the sessionid passed in. p  pCan anyone recommend a technique for achieving this p

Negative 39308 pThough Im sure they exists, Im having difficulties finding or pinning down an official best practice for declaring outlets in a ViewController.p  pThere are 3 options so far as I can seep  ol liivar onlyli liproperty onlyli liproperty backed with an ivarli ol  pXcode currently crashes when I try and autogenerate a property by dragging into my ViewController from IB, but from what I remember, doing so creates a property without an ivar. It is also possible to drag into the ivar section and this will create an ivar without a property. This suggests that propertyonly and ivar only outlets are both OK with apple.p  pSo in viewDidUnload we need to assign nil to any of our outlets, but what about dealloc. If we have used a property without an ivar, how can we release our outlet give that we are not supposed to use any accessors in an init or deallocp  pIt seems to me that the only pattern which would allow us to release our outlet without an accessor is using a property backed with an ivar, so we can manually release our ivar in dealloc without using its accessor, however this is the one option which Apples codegeneration doesnt support.p
Negative 39308 pI have a page with an add item button.  When this button is clicked, an ajax call is made and a table is returned with all the information from the database based on the sku entered.  Dummy data is there now for testing.  If the button is only clicked once, there is no trouble incrementing or decrementing the qty value.  If the button is clicked two, or more, times, if you click the increment button on the second table it will increase the value in the first table.p  pI have added a counter that gives a unique number to each table created.  I think what I want to do is figure out how to determine the counter number for the specific table that is being incremented and pass it to the javascript function so it works with that specific entry.p  pHere is the code with the button, ajax call, and javascriptp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var count  1     items.livepageinit,functionevent         additem.clickfunction               alertadd clicked             var request  .ajax                 url httpwww.furnguy.comapppagesadditem.php,                 type POST,                 data COUNTER  count,                 dataType html                           request.donefunctionhtml                  alerthere                 if html                        salesitems.appendhtml.triggercreate                                            request.failfunctionjqXHR, textStatus                  alert Request failed   textStatus                           count                     function deleteItem          table.clickfunction             this.parent.remove                   function increaseQty          var currentVal  parseIntqty.val         if currentVal  NaN              qty.valcurrentVal  1                   function decreaseQty          var currentVal  parseIntqty.val         if currentVal  NaN              qty.valcurrentVal  1                  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv datarolepage iditems datatitleSales Entry  Itemsgt     ltdiv dataroleheadergt         lth1gtSales Entrylth1gt     ltdivgtlt header gt     ltdiv datarolecontentgt         ltdiv idmainnavgt             ltspan stylefloat left display inline width 100pxgt                 ltlabelgtEnter SKUltlabelgt             ltspangt             ltspan stylefloat left display inline width 250pxgt                 ltinput typetext nameinitialsku id initialsku gt             ltspangt             ltbr gtltbr gtltbr gt             ltbutton idadditem dataiconplus datainlinetrue dataminitrue datathemebgtAdd Itemltbuttongt              lt ltbutton idremoveitem dataiconminus datainlinetrue dataminitrue datathemebgtRemove Itemltbuttongt gt             ltdiv idsalesitemsgtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgtlt content gt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  phere is the page being called by the ajaxp  precodeltphp counter  POST[COUNTER] gt ltbodygt  ltdiv datarolefieldcontaingt  ltdiv classaddItemsgt      lttable idmyTable styleborderbottom 1px solid blackgt          lttrgt              lttd stylewidth 50pxgt                  ltlabel forqtygtQtyltlabelgt              lttdgt              lttd stylewidth 75pxgt                  ltinput typebutton value idincrease onclickincreaseQty stylefloat left display inline gt                 ltinput typebutton value iddecrease onclickdecreaseQty stylefloat left display inline gt                 ltinput typetext nameqty idqty value1 stylefloat left display inline gt             lttdgt              lttd stylewidth 50pxgt                  ltlabel forskugtSKUltlabelgt              lttdgt              lttd stylewidth 350pxgt                  ltinput typetext namesku idsku readonlyreadonly value123526874256 gt              lttdgt              lttd stylewidth 50pxgt                  ltlabel forretailgtRetailltlabelgt              lttdgt              lttd stylewidth 250pxgt                  ltinput typetext nameretail idretail readonlyreadonly value1599.99  gt              lttdgt             lttd idtableNumbergt                 ltphp echo counter gt             lttdgt          lttrgt          lttrgt              lttd stylewidth 50pxgt                  ltlabel fordescgtDescltlabelgt              lttdgt              lttd colspan5gt                  ltinput typetext namedesc iddesc readonlyreadonly valueThis is a really big couch. gt              lttdgt              lttdgt                  ltinput typebutton valueX onclickdeleteItem gt             lttdgt          lttrgt      lttablegt  ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pAnyone have suggestions about this  I would really appreciate the help as I have been working on this for a couple days now.  p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 39308 pI am writing a program in C which is interfacing with a small display unit that does a whole bunch of stuff thats not relevant to this problem.p  pThe problem I have is detailed as follows When the user selects a button which will attempt to SAVE some settings to the device, it uses an acknowledgement protocol to be sure that the settings went through  Meaning  It sends settings then waits for acknowledgement packet from the device.p  pWhat I do is I generate a thread in my main application which is going to be the parent thread of the threads I am about to generate which will attempt to save to the device. Currently, it works in the following mannerp  ul lipGenerate Thread 1  Try to save.pli lipIf timed out, Interrupt Thread 1  to release the data lock of the device via Thread.Interrupt stronglt this is the problemstrong. This doesnt work. It bolds the lock until the device is shut off or unplugged then it errors out.  Then it would gen a new thread, which happens now but it never works because the first thread still locking out the data.pli lipIf it didnt time out, the callback for thread 1 lets the parent thread know not to generate any more threads.pli lipFinally, if none of the threads succeeded then the overall attempt failed.pli ul  pI have also tried doing this with just a single thread being generated and shut down, which also exhibits the same behavior where when waiting for an acknowledgement from the device it hangs permanently until the device is powered off or unplugged.p  pThere is no way to encapsulate that waiting for the device to send an ack with a boolean that could be set to stop the thread because it never leaves the waiting call.  This is embedded software so I cannot modify the waiting function. I can only modify the C interface to the embedded software.p

Negative 39308 pComing from a traditional ER diagram Database centric approach to designing applications, implementing classes using OO approach is causing confusions like shown in examples belowp  p1 Implementing classes for a Many to Many relation.p  pSuppose you have two entities, Professor and College with following relations I do not know how to draw in SO otherwise I would have illustrated the examples with diagramsp  ul liOne Professor may work in different Colleges in different capacities e.g. Lecturer, Guest Lecturer, Lab Assistant, Researcher etc.li liOne College maywill have many Professor working in different positions like Lecturer, Guest Lecturer, Lab Assistant, Researcher etc.li ul  pDoing this the ER way, we would have tables like this p  blockquote   pCollegeTable CollegeId, CollegeNamebr  ProfessorTable   ProfessorId, ProfessorNamebr  LecturerTable LecturerId,   CollegeId, ProfessorId, Timingsbrp blockquote  pSo the many to many relation is a table containing primary keys of both the entities and other relation specific data. If I had to create classes to represent rows of my table they would be likep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeclass CollegeData      string CollegeId     string CollegeName   class ProfessorData      string ProfessorId     string ProfessorName   class LecturerData      string CollegeId     string ProfessorId     DateTime Timings  codepre  pBut doing the same in OOP and mapping entities to class we would have as followsp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeclass College      string CollegeId     string CollegeName   class Professor      string ProfessorId     string ProfessorName   class Lecturer      College aCollege     Professor aProfessor     DateTime Timings  codepre  pSo now doing proper OO way is introducing more load on the system since now we are creating full blown class objects in the manytomany class instead of only having the ID fields. Consider this implication when we have say a Lecturer addedit page where we can edit the Timings or change the Professor. We dont need full blown Professor or College objects since they will have their own master pages for addedit, only their IDs. p  p2 Implementing classes for a One to One relation.p  pExtending above example, suppose we have have a Dean Entity with following constraintfor simplicity assume Dean is not a Professor p  ul liOne College can have one Dean and one person can work as a Dean in only one college.li ul  pAgain the ER way we will havep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeclass DeanData      string DeanId     int DeanExp   class CollegeData      string CollegeId     string CollegeName     string DeanId  codepre  p, while doing it the OOP wayp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeclass Dean      string DeanId     int DeanExp       class College      string CollegeId     string CollegeName     Dean aDean   codepre  pAlso are the issues of mapping OO objects with their table structure representation in a relational database when saving or loading the data. Is there any way I could have done above in proper OO way but without having redundancy Or is this a penalty to be paid for doing things the  OO way p

Negative 39308 pI need to open a file, calculate its MD5, and then open this as an image if the md5 is correct within a C WinrtMetro app.p  pThe problem I have is that the hashing classes in WinRT require IBuffers as returned from FileIO.ReadBufferAsyncStorageFile and the image classes require a RandomAccessStream as returned from StorageFile.OpenReadAsync.p  pObviously I can open the file twice and use both of these calls, but that seems quite inefficient.

From time to time I update my escaping procedures and that means different inputs are escaped differently.p  pthe user has an option to EDIT his post. thus it means that i have to present him the escaped data or un escape the data to prevent escaping a data twice...... SO finally i have come to the conclusion that I save unescaped data from user directly into database. and escape it before Display it has no other purpose.. no use in query etc. for any thing else i have the original data un changed.p  pMy Questionsp  pCan un escaped user data in database still be  dangerous even when not used in queries or escaped before displayp  pIs Escaping with slashes equal  better different than escaping by chaging characters eg lt into lt..p  pIf the data is properly escaped  i mean all special characters can it still be used for XSS attack. SQL injection is out of question.p

Negative 39308 pIm having problems figuring out the best way to model the following relationship with Django.p  pI currently have a Site model as the main model that everything else attaches to. A Site is made of two basic building blocks ModuleSlots and modules. A ModuleSlot is something that a module which Ill describe in just a second can be attached to.p  pThen I have a model called ModuleBase, which is the base model for modules that can be attached to sites moduleslots. A module is a selfcontained piece of site that is itself functional  it doesnt know anything about the outside world. The ModuleBase model is meant to be inherited to create new modules  example modules are a Poll module and Content module. The point is, I want to have the ability to define new kinds of modules in the future, so thats why I went for the baseclass approach. The picture below may better describe what I just wrote.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzuz4T.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comY1nUw.pngp  pNow, I want to bring time into this scheme  ModuleSlots content should be timeable, meaning that the module AND the attached pollcontentetc. should be able to change at the same, predefined time. For example, lets say that a ModuleSlot is currently tied to Content module. I want the ModuleSlot to change to point to a Poll module and show a spesific Poll. This all should happend automatically at spesific time.p  pHow should I present this kind of relationship Ibe been giving this some though and this is what I have so far I think I should create some kind of GenericContent model that is then inherited by individual content types that the modules define, eg. Poll of the PollModule would inherit from GenericContent, and Content of the ContentModule would do the same. I should also introduce TimeSpan for the ModuleSlot. Then, in the backend, I could check every minute if a ModuleSlot needs an update, and do the update if the module and attached content should be changed. What do you guys think The messy picture below may describe the relationships described. p  pIm not sure if the inheritance is the correct way to go here GenericContent. I could also just store id of the PollContentetc. in the ModuleSlot, as all my ids are the same type  since I know the module that is attached to a ModuleSlot, I can ask the Module for the content for the given id.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfRfDN.png althttpi.stack.imgur.comlFE1h.pngp

Negative 39308 pIm trying to write a ray tracer for any objects formed of triangular meshes. Im using an external library to load a cube from .ply format and then trace it down. So far, Ive implemented most of the tracer, and now Im trying to test it with a single cube, but for some reason all I get on the screen is a red line. Ive tried several ways to fix it but I simply cant figure it out anymore. For this primary test, Im only creating primary rays, and if they hit my cube, then I color that pixel to the cubes diffuse color and return. For checking rayobject intersections, I am going through all the triangles that form that object and return the distance to the closest one. It would be great if you could have a look at the code and tell me what could have gone wrong and where. I would greatly appreciate it.p  pRayTriangle intersectionp  precodebool intersectTriconst Vec3Damp rayorigin, const Vec3Damp raydirection, const Vec3Damp v0, const Vec3Damp v1, const Vec3Damp v2, double ampt, double ampu, double ampv const               Vec3D edge1  v1  v0           Vec3D edge2  v2  v0         Vec3D pvec  raydirection.crossedge2         double det  edge1.dotpvec         if det gt  THRESHOLD ampamp det lt THRESHOLD             return false         double invDet  1det           Vec3D tvec  rayorigin  v0         u  tvec.dotpvecinvDet         if u lt 0  u gt 1             return false         Vec3D qvec  tvec.crossedge1         v  raydirection.dotqvecinvDet         if v lt 0  u  v gt 1             return false         t  edge2.dotqvecinvDet         if t lt 0             return false         return true          Object intersection bool intersectconst Vec3Damp rayorigin, const Vec3Damp raydirection, IntersectionDataamp idata, bool enforcemax const               double tClosest         if enforcemax                      tClosest  idata.t                  else                      tClosest  TMAX                   for int i  0  i lt indices.size  i                      const Vec3D v0  vertices[indices[i][0]]             const Vec3D v1  vertices[indices[i][1]]             const Vec3D v2  vertices[indices[i][2]]             double t, u, v             if intersectTrirayorigin, raydirection, v0, v1, v2, t, u, v                              if t lt tClosest                                         idata.t  t                     tClosest  t                                        idata.u  u                     idata.v  v                      idata.index  i                                                return tClosest lt TMAX ampamp tClosest gt 0  true  false       Vec3D traceWorld world, Vec3D amprayorigin, Vec3D ampraydirection   Vec3D objColor  world.backgroundcolor IntersectionData idata double coeff  1.0 int depth  0  double tClosest  TMAX  Object hitObject  NULL    for unsigned int i  0  i lt world.objs.size  i             IntersectionData idatacurr     if world.objs[i].intersectrayorigin, raydirection, idatacurr, false               if idatacurr.t lt tClosest ampamp idatacurr.t gt 0                       idata.t  idatacurr.t             idata.u  idatacurr.u             idata.v  idatacurr.v             idata.index  idatacurr.index              tClosest  idatacurr.t                         hitObject  ampworld.objs[i]                if hitObject  NULL      return world.backgroundcolor  else      return hitObjectgtgetDiffuse    int mainint argc, char argv   parsecube.ply Vec3D diffusion11, 0, 0 Vec3D specular11, 1, 1 Object cube1coordinates, connectedvertices, diffusion1, specular1, 0, 0 World wrld  Add objects to the world wrld.objs.pushbackcube1 Vec3D background0, 0, 0 wrld.backgroundcolor  background  Set light color Vec3D lightclr1, 1, 1 wrld.lightcolors.pushbacklightclr  Set light position Vec3D light0, 64, 10 wrld.lightpositions.pushbacklight  int width  128 int height  128 Vec3D image  new Vec3D[widthheight] Vec3D pixel  image   Trace rays for int y  height2  y lt height2  y      for int x  width2  x lt width2  x, pixel              Vec3D raydirx0.5, y0.5, 1.0         raydir.normalize         Vec3D rayorig0.5width, 0.5height, 0.0         pixel  tracewrld, rayorig, raydir                   savePPM.test.ppm, image, width, height return 0   codepre  pIve just ran a test case and I got this p  pa hrefhttps17.postimage.org71y7pt60vtest.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKpWNh.png width200ap  pfor a unit cube centered at 0,0, 1.5 and scaled on the X and Y axis by 100.

Ive installed the systemmodels project into the global python lib directory using python setup.py install.  However, when running python manage.py shell from within the regalbeagle project, Im unable to access the Datasource model of systemmodels even when using the fully qualified path.  p  precodefrom systemmodels.datasources.models import Datasource as SystemDatasource from regalbeagle.datasources.models import Datasource codepre  pWhen I use the python inspect module to see which file is being loaded, Im seeing the followingp  precodeinspect.getfileSystemDatasource Usersgeorgesvnregalbeagletrunkregalbeagle..regalbeagledatasourcesmodels.pyc  inspect.getfileDatasource Usersgeorgesvnregalbeagletrunkregalbeagle..regalbeagledatasourcesmodels.pyc codepre  pHowever, if I create a dummy model within systemmodels of which there is no corresponding regalbeagle class, the path seems recognizedp  precodefrom systemmodels.datasources.models import DummyClass inspect.getfileDummyClass LibraryPython2.6sitepackagessystemmodelsdatasourcesmodels.pyc codepre  pSo my question is how does Django magically swap the Datasource class in systemmodels for the one in regalbeagle even though I imported using the full path  If django doesnt like having two applications with the same name, why does my DummyClass seem to work ok  p  pThe easiest fix seems to be to change the systemmodels model name to be SystemDatasource explicitly, but that seems to defeat the purpose of modulespackaging.p  pSo my question isp  pIs there some kind of additional information that I can specify so that Django will allow these to Models to coexist  Or am I SOLp  pAs promised, the explanation for why I need these two versions of Datasourcep  pI have a backend crawl process that needs to be able to write data into a database and for performance reasons I wanted this database separate from my web application.  So I created a systemdb and syncd my systemmodels project against this.  My web application is able to view aggregated stats on the data that was crawled by the backend process and the information to do this is in the regalbeagle database.

Negative 39308 pWe have an ASP.NET Web API app which uses Ninject for DI. This works perfect for use. One of the improvements we were considering is the ability to swap out parts of functionality per request based on some sort of unique identifier.p  pExample. Two customers use our restful api. Both get the same functionality. A third customer has paid for the super version of our api. He makes the request, we load the super dll and bind the super implementations to the standard interfaces.p  pEssentially what I am looking to see is can we load a DLL and swap out bindings per request using Web API and Ninject.p  pEDITp  pSo both answers are correct for the original question but my intention is different and it is my fault for not explaining it correctly. What we have is a base layer of functionality that everyone gets. On top of this we also have the ability to implement custom logic on a per customer basis that overrides this functionality. This logic is stored as a DLL in Azure Blob Storage.p  pWhat we would like to do is when a customer makes a request is go get the DLL, bind all the custom services and then service the request using these new bindings.p  pIs hot swapping not the best way to do this We are new enough to ninject so this may be a common thing that is implemented in a different way to what we are considering.p  pTo some up, we would like to be able to service custom bindings on a per customer basis.p  pEDIT 2p  pWe use conditional bindings for items were we know that we have alternate implementations but in the scenario above until we get the customer info and scan the dll we do not know if we have alternate bindings. We dont even know if there is a dll.p  pWe would like to do it this way so we can drop the file in rather than referencing it in the project.p

All clients can have a job number 1 eg ClientID 12345 and ClientID 12346 can both have JobNumber1. At the moment this all works fine, but id like to have the the Job that has the newest post related to it in the Posts table at the top, and then the next newest, and so on.p  pAt the moment after some research ive got to thisp  precodeSELECT Jobs. FROM Jobs LEFT JOIN Posts ON Posts.JobNumberJobs.JobNumber GROUP BY Jobs.ClientID, Jobs.JobNumber ORDER BY Posts.PostDate codepre  pAnd whilst I am getting all of the results, I am not getting them in order of the date of the post. I have a feeling it is because im not actually pulling the PostDate value from the Posts table, but ive tried loads and im not managing to get anything to workp  pIf anyone could give me any pointers itd be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.p
Negative 39308 pI am transforming a large xml document with the XSLT engine of Firefox. When this file is too large for Firefox, the browser just freezes much earlier in Mac Os  i7 than in a Windows  core 2 duo, surprising. p  pAs a way to make easier the process, I have splited the xml file in small parts, transforming them serially. This has improved things and velocity a lot. However, when the file is still large, I have the same symptoms.p  pNow, what I think is happening is that the transformToFragment function is asynchronous. It means that I am starting the following transformation before the previous one has finished, and at the end it blocks the browser and actually the computer as well.p  pThen, I cannot find any event that I could rely on before continuing with the process. Does anybody have any idea of how to do itp  pThanksp

I was using codereadelf Acode and looking for codeTagTHUMBISAuse Thumb1code, but this seem to be in strongarmstrong only code but was built with the interworking compiler as well as codethumbcode code.

Negative 39308 pI use the AnyChartAnyMap system to render custom maps for my site, currently version 6.0.11. Were displaying a map of the USA split up into regions, and each region is assigned a color according to a palette.

I can omit the section entirely and it still doesnt work. On a related note, if I change the codeignoreautoitemcode parameter to False, or remove it entirely, the entire application blows up.p  pThis is sort of a last resort as the AnyCharts fools arent responding to tech support requests, and their sales guy redirected me to a friend of his who wants to charge me 150hr. Theyre claiming its something in my XML thats broken, but based on their API docs, my XML is perfectly fine. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.p  pI should note that Im using the AnyChartsFlex SWC that comes with their system, run through a custom Flex app. All this app does is provide a wrapper with additional functionality that users of my site require, and doesnt mess with the actual chart itself in any meaningful way just adds a couple event listeners, nor does it touch the XML before it gets to their library to be rendered, and works perfectly.p

Negative 39308 pA little background story on this questionp  pIm writing a POS system for my local bar, which I would like to be pluginenabled. For this particular problem Ill use the following scenariop  pIve got a calculator class which, as the name suggests, does all the calculations involving products on the current receipt, VAT, etc.  I want this class to be extendable by a plugin in a different assembly to add a functionality to use these special coins we use. The calculator simply loops through all the products on the receipt which is passed in its constructor to calculate the total amount.  The receipt class has a list of all the product objects that are on it. The builtin product class does not have any members related to coins, these are in another product class in the plugin assembly.p  pstrongThe questionstrong herein is, how do I make my main program dynamically select the correct class to use for productsp  pI was thinking of loading all the plugins into a list or dictionary and simply loop through them to check if an override for the product class exists and then use that, but I would still need some kind of common interface, which is not an option. I know exactly how to do it in PHP, but there one can editreplace the source with an updated one at runinstall time.p  pThanks in advance, Thom.p  pstrongEDITstrong To simplify the problem Is it possible to have an external plugin assembly extend a builtin assembly with new methods, without having to hardcode the methods namesdelegateswhatever in the existing applicationp

Negative 39308 pI have a horizontally scrolling UITableView on the bottom of my iPad app, and when the user taps on one of the cells, I pop up a UIActionSheet from it allowing them to select between two options.p  pThat part works fine, but Im running into two UI problems when dismissing the actionsheet. p  p1 When the user clicks outside of the UIActionSheet and not a different UITableViewCell, Id like to deselect that cell immediately and then dismiss the UIActionSheet, or fade them both out at the same time. However, when I implement p  ul livoidactionSheetUIActionSheet actionSheet willDismissWithButtonIndexNSIntegerbuttonIndexli ul  pto do this, it still results in the actionsheet slowly fading out before deselecting the cell, which just looks a little odd. It happens whether Im calling [self.tableView deselectRowAtIndexPathself.tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow animatedNO], by getting that cell and changing the appearance manually, or reloading the table. Even if I maintain a reference to the UIActionSheet from when I create it e.g. self.actionSheet and set it to hidden or nil when willDismissWithButtonIndex is called, it still operates this way.p  p2 If the user clicks outside the UIActionSheet but selects another TableViewCell, Id like to instantly shift the UIActionSheet to the other cell. Right now, however, it just fades out slowly and then the user has to tap the new cell again in order to bring up the UIActionSheet for that cell.p  pAnyone have suggestions or experience with this issuep  pAll the best,p  pTobyp

Negative 39308 pIm new to event handling and threading in C, so forgive me if this question is basic How do I create several classes to run on different threads, all listening for the same eventp  pFor example, I receive a new piece of data frequently but at random intervals. When this data arrives I update a class with the new data, lets call it codeMyDataClasscode, which raises an event codeMyDataClass.NewEventcode.p  pThen I have a class called codeNewEventListenercode. When an event fires, this class does some calculation with the new data, then sends the result to another application.p  pSo the problem is this I need to have around 30 instances of codeNewEventListenercode all listening to codeMyDataClass.NewEventcode each does different calculation and produces a different result. Its important that these calculations all run simultaneously  as soon as the event fires all 30 instances of codeNewEventListenercode start calculating. However it does not matter if they finish together or not e.g. theres no synchronisation needed here.p  pHow do I actually create the instances of codeNewEventListenercode so that they run on different threads, and get them to all listen to a single instance of codeMyDataClass.NewEventcodep

Negative 39308 pI have a collection of small helper scripts for a more complex shell script, and while this works well, I decided I wanted to reduce this into a single script for a variety of reasons.p  pSo Im thinking Ill use here documents so that I can create nested shell scripts for running either locally or remotely as appropriate. This works well enough as I can do the followp  precodebinsh nestedscriptcat ltlt NESTEDSCRIPT      Script commands NESTEDSCRIPT  echo nestedscript  sh codepre  pNot the most functional example, but the fact that I can send it to codesshcode instead makes this very useful.p  pHowever, the problem Im having is that I cant figure out how to also supply arguments to the nested script, as if I add anything to the codeshcode command then it interprets it as a file to run and ignores standard input entirely.p  pOn my local machine I can do codeecho script  sh devstdin foo barcode and it will work perfectly, but I dont believe the remote machines Im working with support the use of codedevstdincode in that way.p  pAre there any other solutions Currently Im forcing the arguments into the script string using codesedcode but that isnt a very nice way to do it.p  pFor those wondering the reason Im trying to do this this way is that my nested scripts may be running locally, or may be running remotely, depending upon whether a host is supplied. I dont really want to create files on the remote host to run but would rather just run the commands remotely, which this method seems like it would enable if I could get it to work like I want.p

Negative 39308 pIm planning to use Riak for storing some sensor data, but sensors are connected to different users. My plan is to make a structure like this Bucket  user id key  time, new key each minute or two minutes maybep  pWhen I say a new key each minute, the readings are not always continuous and are not real time, but they are being uploaded later. They are recorded at certain periods of the day. The frequency of metering is quite high, 250 samples a second. If I make a new key for each measurement, I will get an explosion of keys very fast and I dont think it will do good for performance. Besides that, I do not really need to know the precise number at each given moment, I will use them more sequentially in a period values from minute N to minute M.p  pSo Im thinking of grouping the results for each minute, and storing them like that as some JSON.p  pDoes this strategy look feasiblep  pAlso, Im thinking about using LevelDB as the storage engine, just to be on the safe side as far as RAM usage goes. p

Negative 39308 pI am searching some other ajax technology related to spring.p  pThe main problem is part of html pages has repeated many times, and forcing big part of page to renders continuously ,example one to many relation ship parts. That is boring to invoke same objects each time in new controllers.p  pAlso writing custom  nested jsp  tag just give me some html pages view code reduction but take to long time developing,also in controller layer I have to invoke object again and reuse them that make heavy unnecessary load ,also force to refactor Involved controllers. so I need some thing like binding controller to one part of page. That reusable in any other  jsp page .I know I can do this in ajax but It give me many complex and huge js code. So question isp  pDoes spring mvc  iframes productive Is spring can manage security session with Iframes Can It be alternative to portletp
Negative 39308 pI am trying to get a good understanding of Javas primitive data types. I already got a good overview and I understand how signed integer values are stored in Java, and how to tellcalculate the range of a byte, short, integer or longdata type.p  pSo, when looking at the Java data type int I know that it is a 32 bit signed value, thus I can tell exactly how many different states a inttype can store and what the range of that datatype is i.e. 232 different states, resulting in a range from 231 through 2311 or roughly 2e9 through 2e9.p  pWhen looking at the data type float, however, I need some help. I understand that Javas float data type is a 32 bit type just like int, thus I would assume that it can also store a total of 232 different states. However, when I look at the numbers given in this table a hrefhttpwww.javacamp.orgjavaIprimitiveTypes.html relnofollowhttpwww.javacamp.orgjavaIprimitiveTypes.htmla I dont understand how this data type can store floating point numbers in the range from roughly 3e38 through 3e38 which is already a much wider range than what int can cover PLUS all the singleprecision floating point decimals in between  with just 32 bit.p  pCan any one please explain how floating point numbers are stored and why it looks like it can store more information than int within the same number of bits which feels pretty much impossible to me Maybe you can point me to a good read or show me where I made a logical mistake.p

I want to execute this formula for all previous values of A8 and add them together, adding upwards strongUNTILstrong A8 equals the current selection. or while A8lt09, however this can be accomplishedp  pSo assuming A808, I want it to start at A801, run this code and find the value. Then run A802, find that value, then add it to the first value, continuing this until we get to A808 and then reporting the final value. Since the singledigit months are written in twodigits ie 01, 02, 03, etc and searched using the leading 0, I think its fairly important the loop account for it up until we get twodigit months 10, 11, 12....p  pSomething along the lines of and this is NOT code, just a general thoughtprocessp  precodeSub Loop1 Dim x as integer x01 Do until x  Cell A8       insert the formula above, but with ampA8amp  x x  1  x End Sub codepre  pbut even this thoughtprocess doesnt seem to add the resulting formula values together, so I need help with that.

Thanks for lookingp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pPlease excuse my poor description, hopefully this clarifiesp  pThe code is a part of a table. Cell A8 is a dropdown selection where you choose the numberical month you want to examine 01, 02  12. The formula then looks for a string using a set of reference cells, lets say Rev Bud 08 2013where 08 comes from your selection, then looks for a column with that title then performs the sumifs. But I want a yeartodate, so i want it to exceute the formula once for each x, starting at x1, and up to and including whatever value is selected in cell A8, then add the results from all of the executions together and display that value in a cell of my choosing, lets say cell C50. So I want it to do the sumifs starting on the column with the title Rev Bud 01 2013 then Rev Bud 02 2013 .... all the way until Rev Bud [my selection] 2013 and add all of those together. p

Negative 39308 pSo I have a seamless texture. The black lines in the picture represent the repeating texture. Then I have a series of blocks who have known x,y coordinates and known height and width. In Unity Textures have a scale and offset. p  pScale is the amount of the texture that will show on the block. So the block starting at 0,0 will have a scale of about .2,1.3. Its width is .2x the width of a single texture for the sake of simple numbers and its height is about 1.3x the height of the texture.p  pOffset then moves the starting point of the texture. The block at 0,0 will have an offset of 0,0 because it is perfectly aligned with a corner but the block immediately to its right would have a texture of about .2,0 because the texture needs to start about .2 units in to align properly. This is as far as I understand offset. I am pretty sure this is correct but feel free to correct me if I am wrong.p  pNow when you apply a texture to a block unity automatically scales the texture to start at the top left corner of the block and stretch it appropriately to fit 1 full iteration inside of that space. I obviously dont want this.p  pMy question comes in for the three blocks labeled with the x,y coordinates. I have tried for several hours over a few weeks to get it right, unsuccessfully. p  pSo how do I take in the x,y position and widthheight to create a correct scale and offset so that those blocks will look like they are exactly where they are supposed to be in the texture p  pIt is not a particularly difficult concept but after staring at it I have no more ideas. p  pFor the sake of the question assume a single texture is 12x12. The x,y and widthheight are known values but are arbitrary. p  pI know its normally good practice to post attempted code but I would rather see a good way of doing it than see answers that try to fix my failed attempts. But I will post code if people want to see that I did try on my own or how I initially tried.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comr1ioW.png altenter image description herep

Negative 39308 pIm adapting an existing collection of libraries, building them as OSGi bundles. Its a multimodule Maven project, with several layers of POM inheritance and aggregation. Ideally, plugin configuration would be placed in parent POMs only.p  pThe project is composed of more than 100 jars. Theres already a mega bundle that encompasses the entire library and export all packages. My effort aims at making the library more modular, which is the main reason of having them as OSGi bundles in the first place.p  pThe main issue is this library has a split package nightmare, and I cannot change the package structure. Im trying to solve the issue using codeRequireBundlecode, as recommended in the book emOSGi in Actionem, even though the book mentions its not a good practice. I tried the recommendation of using an arbitrary attribute named split in codeImportPackagecode to separate parts of a bundle and only import certain packages. But due to the number of bundles providing the same package, that turned out to be too complicated to configure.p  pMy strongquestionstrong is how to configure the codemavenbundleplugincode codeltRequireBundlegtcode directive, if at all possible, to use wildcards e.g.  as a form of telling it to use all Maven dependencies, instead of having to manually list all bundles names and versions i.e. is there an alternative to thisp  precodeltRequireBundlegtlibapi versionproject.versionltRequireBundlegt codepre  pthat uses some kind of wildcard matching and that could be put in a parent POMp

Negative 39308 pI would like to use a parameter for the table name. I have an application that creates several new tables each month. I therefore need the table name to be sent into CR via a parameter. The fields for the tabkes are always identical. I can present a list view from the database to the end user that would display a user friendly name for the table, when the user selects the instance they want I then have the table name I want to report from.p
Negative 39308 pI have wordpress installed and a script that makes posts out of csv files.

Both WP set ups are the same, same domain. Why would I get this error in one subdomain but not the other With identical file.csv and adder.php p  pEarlier today the script was giving the below error as it was out of memory.p  p[17Nov2013 110005] PHP Fatal error  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted tried to allocate 8388608 bytes in pathadder.php on line 16p  pSo I added codeinisetmemorylimit,256Mcode to the top of the script.

Negative 39308 pIm building an API, protected by Doorkeeper.p  pIf I manually create the user with password in the backend, and then post the following to codeoauthtokencode, Doorkeeper successfully generates an access token for the user and returns itp  precodedata       username emailsignin.val,     password password.val,     granttype password,     clientid 880c16e50aee5893446541a8a0b3788....,     clientsecret a5108e1a1aeb87d0bb49d33d8c50d....,     provider identity  codepre  pHowever, Im trying to get my head around how I could do a sign up flow.p  pIve happily got codeuserscreatecode working, in so far as it creates a user and password, but Im not sure how to then generate the DoorkeeperAccessToken in the next step, and return it to the client.  Ideally, after creating the user in the usercreate action Id then redirect to POST to codeoauthtokencode, with the users name and password, but I know that you cant redirect to a POST.p  pIve had a dig around the Doorkeeper source, but am getting a bit lost in all this clever middleware.

Negative 39308 pWe are currently using Entity Framework as an ORM across a few web applications, and until now, it has suited us well as all our data is stored in a single database. We are using the repository pattern, and have services the domain layer which use these, and return the EF entities directly to the ASP.NET MVC controllers.p  pHowever, a requirement has come up to utilise a 3rd party API through a web service which will give us extra information that relates to the user in our database. In our local User database, we will store an external ID which we can provide the to API to get additional information. There is quite a bit of information available, but for the sake of simplicity, one of them relates to the users company name, manager, room, job title, location etc. This information will be used in various places throughout our web apps  as opposed to being used in a single place.p  pSo my question is, where is the best place to populate and access this information As it is used in various places, its not really sensible to fetch it on an adhoc basis wherever we use in the web application  so it makes sense to return this additional data from the domain layer. p  pMy initial thought was just to create a wrapper model class which would contain the EF entity EFUser, and a new ApiUser class containing the new information  and when we get a user, we get the EFUser, and then get the additional info from the API, and populate the ApiUser object. However, whilst this would be fine for getting single users, it falls over when getting multiple users. We cant hit the API when getting a list of users.p  pMy second thought was just to add a singleton method to the EFUser entity which returns the ApiUser, and just populate it when needed. This solves the above problem as we only access it when we need it.p  pOr the final thought was to keep a local copy of the data in our database, and synchronise it with the API when the user logs in. This is minimal work as its just a synchronisation process  and we dont have the overhead of hitting the DB and API every time we want to get user information. However, these means storing the data in two places, and also means the data is out of date for any user that hasnt logged in for a while.p  pDoes anyone have any advice or suggestions on how best to handle this kind of scenariop

N2 is for the second date. p  pBelow is my written codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdbool.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt struct date          int month         int day         int year       int f int theyear,  int themonth     if themonth lt2         theyear  theyear1     else         theyear theyear      return theyear   int g int Month     if Monthlt2         MonthMonth13     else          Month  Month1      return Month   int main        struct date time1, time2     int N1 int N2        printfEnter time1 mm,dd,yyyy      scanfiii, amptime1.month, amptime1.day, amptime1.year      printfEnter time2 mm,dd,yyyy      scanfiii, amptime2.month, amptime2.day, amptime2.year     N11461  ftime1.year,time1.month  4  153  gtime2.month  5 3     N2  1461  ftime2.year,time2.month4 153  gtime2.month5 21        printfd n,absN1 N2      return 0   codepre  pThank you very much. p  pSample inputoutputp  pEnter time1 mm,dd,yyyy 04 10 1994 Enter time2 mm,dd,yyyy 03 10 1994 18 p  pAs you can see, it prints out 18.

Negative 39308 pstrongScenariostrongbr I have a variety of types that can be classified as sequence containers.br All sequence containers are data structures, but   not every data structure will be a sequence container.  p  pHere is an example of that illustrated in code. The only important type involved in this example, is the ArrayT. It falls into two categories Its a sequence container, and since all sequence containers are data structures, it is in turn, a data structure.p  precodeA sequence container type class ArrayT  A type trait for that particular sequence container template lttypename Tgt struct IsArray            static const bool value  false  template ltgt           struct IsArrayltArrayTgt   static const bool value  true    A type trait to identify all of the sequence containers template lttypename Tgt struct IsASequenceContainer  static const bool value  IsArrayltTgtvalue  would probably or together more sequence types, but we only have ArrayT in this example   A type trait to identify all of the data structures template lttypename Tgt struct IsADataStructure  static const bool value  IsASequenceContainerltTgtvalue  would probably or together more data structure types, but we only have sequence containers in this example  codepre  pPlease note that no inheritance can be done on ArrayT it must remain the way it has been declared.p  hr  pstrongProblemstrongbr I want to write two functions.  One function will handle all of the sequence containers, and the other function will handle all of the data structures.  I dont know whether or not the sequence container function will actually exist or not, since that portion of the code may or may not get generated.p  pSo, how can I use metatemplate programming, to choose the closest matching identification for the type  Here are two examples of the expected behaviourp  pCase 1p  precode ... Both functions exist Call the more specific one.  ...  functionArrayT  prints sequence container codepre  pCase 2p  precode ... Only the data structure one existsnot the sequence container one  ...  functionArrayT  prints data structure codepre  hr  pstrongMy attempt so farstrongp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include lttypetraitsgt  A sequence container type class ArrayT  A type trait for that particular sequence container template lttypename Tgt struct IsArray            static const bool value  false  template ltgt           struct IsArrayltArrayTgt   static const bool value  true    A type trait to identify all of the sequence containers template lttypename Tgt struct IsASequenceContainer  static const bool value  IsArrayltTgtvalue  would probably or together more sequence types, but we only have ArrayT in this example   A type trait to identify all of the data structures template lttypename Tgt struct IsADataStructure  static const bool value  IsASequenceContainerltTgtvalue  would probably or together more data structure types, but we only have sequence containers in this example     all of this code was already shown to you   NOTE This function MAY OR MAY NOT actually appear in the source code This function handles all sequence types templateltclass T, typename stdenableifltIsASequenceContainerltTgtvalue,intgttype0gt void functionT t      stdcout ltlt sequence container ltlt stdendl     return   This function handles all data structures assuming a more specific function does not existcough the one above it templateltclass T, typename stdenableifltIsADataStructureltTgtvalue,intgttype0gt void functionT t      stdcout ltlt data structure ltlt stdendl     return   int main      functionArrayT  codepre  pNow I realize this doesnt work, because the value will be true for BOTH of the enableifs.br So I want to add a second enableif onto the data structure function to check to see if the sequence container function exists.  Something like thisp  precode...

Is there a way to do this without touching the ArrayT deceleration, and without involving a third function for dispatchingp

Negative 39308 pAs far as I understand atomic operation are one that are indivisible that is one thread can see the state of a system before thread 2 changes it or after the change made by thread 2 but not in between. p  psay for example I have a method on a shared object betwwen 2 threadsp  precodepublic void incrementMe    incrementing a shared int for this example  atomicInt.incrementAndGet  codepre  pthat for example that the initial value of our atomic int is 5. Now thread 1 and thread 2 are both calling incrementMe at the same time. what will happen as far as I understand thread 1 will see the value 5 and increment it to 6 at the same time thread 2 will see the value 5 since the increment is atomic so thread 2 can see the value after change of after but no in between so it increment it to 6 and at the end I will have the value 6 instead of 7.

Negative 39308 pI have a little problem and cant know by myself the solution.

Sometimes the boolean is jumping activates too, so in resume it goes crazy and I think its because the handling collisions method didBeginContact only allows two contact bodies, contact.bodyA and contact.bodyB.p  pI would like to know if I can edit a file to add a contact.bodyC and what file do I need to edit and if yes I will handle with this, I think with three contact bodies I will be able to program all the posible cases.

Negative 39308 pIn my web application a product is defined by N number of product options and a product object. To display a full product I need to create a view model that will hold the product object, a list of product options and for each product option a list of possible values. My question is what is best practice Where should I construct this object p  pIn my mvc application I have a service layer, should I do it in the service layer and have something like productservice.getproductid return the view model ready for the view...or in my controller do I use a combination of...p  pcodeProductservice.getProductId and productoptionService.getProductoptionsproductIdcodep  pAnd then inside the controller construct the view Modelp  pMy guess is to go with the first option, any ideasp
Negative 39308 pIm trying to make some improvements to a interpreter for microcontrollers that Im working on. For executing builtin functions I currently have something like this albeit a bit fasterp  precodefunction executeBuiltinfunctionName, functionArgs    if functionNamefoo foogetIntFromArgfunctionArgs[0]   if functionNamebar bargetIntFromArgfunctionArgs[0],getBoolFromArgfunctionArgs[1],getFloatFromArgfunctionArgs[2]   if functionNamebaz baz   ...  codepre  pBut it is for an embedded device ARM with very limited resources, and I need to cut down on the code size drastically. What Id like to do is to have a generalpurpose function for calling other functions with strongdifferent argumentsstrong  something like thisp  precodefunction executeBuiltinfunctionName, functionArgs    functionData  fastlookupfunctionName   callwithargsfunctionData.functionPointer, functionData.functionArgumentTypes, functionArgs  codepre  pSo I want to be able to call a standard C function and pass it whatever arguments it needs which could all be of different types. For this, I need a codecallwithargscode function. p  pI want to avoid rewriting every function to take argcargv. Ideally each function that was called would be an entirely standard C function.p  pTheres a a hrefhttpcfaq.comvarargsinvvarargs.19930307.html relnofollowdiscussion about this herea  but has anything changed since 1993 when that post was written Especially as Im running on ARM where arguments are in registers rather than on the stack. Even if its not in standard C, is there anything GCC specific that can be donep  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong It seems that despite behaviour being undefined according to the spec, it looks like because of the way C calls work, you can pass more arguments to a function than it is expecting and everything will be fine, so you can unpack all the arguments into an array of uint32s, and can then just pass each uint32 to the function.p  pThat makes writing nice code for calls much easier, and it appears to work pretty well on 32 bit platforms.

The function fx makes sure of this end  C10 for j1m     C1C1Ljwj.2 end  CC0C1 codepre  pIn a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21441457neuralnetworkcostfunctioninmatlabprevious SO questiona I asked about a different summation series, and someone mentioned getting rid of the loops altogether and using matrix operations. They then provided me with a vectorized version. The code they provided me with worked perfectly, but I do not know how they went about deriving it from the summation series equation I provided.p  pSo in general, how do you go about implementing a summation series in MATLAB without loopsp  pWhat are some general rules I can learn, so in future I can implement any summation series in vectorized formp  pThanksp

Negative 39308 pI have a simple rails app that scrapes JSON from a remote URL for each instance of a model lets call it A.  The app then creates a new datapoint under an associated model of the 1st.  Lets call this middle model B and the data point model C.  Theres also a front end that lets users browse this data graphicallyvisually.p  pThus the hierarchy is A has many  B which has many  C.  I scrape a URL for each A which returns a few instances of B with new Cs that have data for the respective B.    p  pWhile attempting to testscale this app I have encountered a problem where rails will stop processing, hang for a while, and finally throw a ActiveRecordConnectionTimeoutError could not obtain a database connection within 5.000 seconds  Obviously the 5 is just the default.  p  pI cant understand why this is happening when 1 there are no DB calls being made explicitly, 2 the log doesnt show any under the hood DB calls happening when it does work 3 it works sometimes and not others.  p  pWhats going on with rails 4 AR and the connection poolp  pA couple of notesp  ol liThe general algorithm is to spawn a thread for each model A, scrape the data, create in memory new instances of model C, save all the Cs in one transaction at the end.li liSometimes this works, other times it doesnt, i cant figure out what causes it to fail.  However, once it fails it seems to fail more and more.li liI eager load all the model As and Bs to begin with.li liI use a transaction at the end to insert all the newly created C instances.li liI currently use resque and resque scheduler to do this work but I highly doubt they are the source of the problem as it persists even if I just do rails runner Class.doworkli ol  pAny suggestions and or thoughts greatly appreciated  p

Negative 39308 pIm struggling with finding an efficient solution for the following problemp  pI have a large manipulated data frame with around 8 columns and 80000 rows that generally includes multiple data types. I want to create a new data frame that includes the sum of one column if conditions from the large data frame are met.p  pImagine the head of the original data frame looks like this. The column years.raw indicates that the company measured data for x years.p  precodegt cbindcompany.raw,years.raw,source,amount.inkg      company.raw years.raw source      amount.inkg [1,] C1        1       Ink       5         [2,] C1        1       Recycling 2         [3,] C2        1       Coffee    10        [4,] C2        1       Combusted 15        [5,] C2        2       Printer   14        [6,] C2        2       Tea       18    codepre  pWhat I need to do now is to create a new data frame that sums up the values of column amount.inkg for every company and every year based on certain string elements. I saved the string elements in three vectors below. The string elements are part of the column source from the original data frame.p  precodegt vector1 lt cTea,Coffee gt vector2 lt cInk,Printer gt vector3 lt cRecycling,Combusted codepre  pThe preferred data frame would then look like thisp  precodeCompany Year              amount.vector1    amount.vector 2 amount.vector 3 C1           1                 0             5                 2 C2           1                 10            0                15         C2           2                 18            14                0 codepre  pThe general approach for amount.vector1 would be  Sum up the values of column amount.inkg for every company and every year where string elements of the original data frame column source string elements of vector1.  The same for column amount.vector2 except that the elements are different of course. p  pIf there are no values available, a 0 should be added instead a NA error. This needs to be done for the whole raw data frame that includes around 250 companies with data for every company for the years 18 differs quite a lot.p  pstrongEdit For the data frame I need onerowpercompanyperyear.strongp  precodeC1 Year 1   C1 Year 2 C1 Year 3 C2 Year 1 C2 Year 2 codepre  pI tried to write a function that combines these conditions but I failed.

Does anybody have a suggestion in that subject  Where should I read or how should I proceed  I believe that Perl is more than capable to fix this issue, but I guess I am not using correct tools. p  precodeopenmy data,lt, file my lines  ltdatagt  foreach lines      chomp      my line        my each  split ,line     if each  10         my logt  split,each[3]        my llg1         if logt[1]  200             llg  9                 my urln  new URIURL each[6]        my netl  urlngtnetloc         my flnm  md5hexnetl        my urlm  md5hexeach[6]         if   d outp..flnm             mkdir outp..flnm,0644                 openmy csvf,gtgt.outp..flnm..time..urlm or die         print csvf inteach[0]..each[2]..llg.n        close csvf   gtgt I want to get rid of this so I can use buffer                else         print badf line        codepre  pAssume that above code is used inside a subroutine and are threaded 12 times.

Negative 39308 pIm writing an app that allows the user to take a picture and then shows it in an image view.p  pI get that I need to write a line of code similar to the following codeimageView.image  picker.imagecode, but Im not sure what I need to substitute for codepicker.imagecode.  That is what I currently have and it gives me an error.p  pBasically, what Im asking is how do I reference the picture that was just taken  Where does this picture go in memory after you take it  How can I reference it later like for displaying and saving and that sort of stuffp  pIve already read the official Apple documentation and looked at a few tutorials and the answer doesnt seem to be in any of them.  As Ive mentioned in previous posts, I tend to have a lot of trouble parsing the Apple documentation, so its been mostly useless for me.p  pThank youp

Negative 39308 pIm very busy with the architecture of a new MVC application, but im getting very confused about how to manage different type of objects. The confusion is about the relation between entities, business objects and viewmodels. I m going to describe my confusion with an examplep  pIve set up my web application with different projects MVC frontend, BLL, DAL, Common things etc.p  pLets say i have a view with a List of bikes. I want to display the bike details like color, size, manufacturer. But in my database, the Bike and Manufacturer are two different tables, so in my Entity Framework context, these are also two different classes.p  pSo i have these two entities Bike and Manufacturer. But in my business needs, i think they need to be a single object, which i can manipulate or use in business logic. Then there is my view, which needs a ViewModel. That should also be a combined ViewModel with properties from different tables.p  pHow do i handle this Do i need to get the Bike and Manufacturer object from my DAL, and create a business object from it in my BLL, and after doing some business logic, should i create a ViewModel from it in my controller Or does my DAL need to return a combined business object Or can i use the entity object as business classes Or can i also use my business object as a ViewModelp  pI hope that my problem is clear and that anyone can give me a good advise about which object are needed and how, where and when the different types of objects are created, and in which layer this classes should go...p

Negative 39308 pI have a QEMU image with a snapshot stored in it. Right now Im using libvirt to start it. p  pHowever, I want to be able to run more than one instance out of the same imagesnapshot.p  pI guess I can do that by cloning the virtualhd and installingcreating a new domain emvirshem and then running revert from snapshot. But I want to be able to do that pretty much onthefly with as little as possible latency from the time I decide I need to run another instance of image X to the time that instance is running from the stored snapshot.p  pAnyone did anything like that I started thinking maybe libvirt is not lowlevel enough for this p  p[EDIT Sorry if this wasnt clear  Im talking about a RAMHD snapshot, not just HD snapshot, which I already know how to create...]p  pThanksp

At any time an RTOS is   running, the flow of execution, also known as flow of control, is   passing through one of three areas through an application task,   through an ISR, or through the kernel. When a task or ISR makes a   system call, the flow of control passes to the kernel to execute one   of the system routines provided by the kernel. When it is time to   leave the kernel,  the dispatcher is responsible for passing control   to one of the tasks in the users application. It will not necessarily   be the same task that made the system call.p      pIt is the scheduling algorithms to be discussed shortly of the   scheduler that determines which task executes next. It is the   dispatcher that does the actual work of context switching and passing   execution control. p      pDepending on how the kernel is first entered, dispatching can happen   differently. When a task makes system calls, the dispatcher is used to   exit the kernel  after every system call completes. In this case, the   dispatcher is used on a callbycall basis so that it can coordinate   taskstate transitions that any of  the system calls might have   caused. One or more tasks may have become ready to run, for example.p      pOn the other hand, if an ISR makes system calls, the dispatcher is   bypassed until the ISR fully completes its execution. This process is   true even if some  resources have been freed that would normally   trigger a context switch between tasks. These context switches do not   take place because the ISR must complete  without being interrupted by   tasks. After the ISR completes execution, the kernel exits through the   dispatcher so that it can then dispatch the correct taskp blockquote  p. p  pMy question on above text isp  ol liWhat does author mean by When a task makes system calls, the dispatcher is used to exit the kernel after every system call completes. In this case, the dispatcher is used on a callbycall basis so that it can coordinate taskstate transitions that any of the system calls might have caused..

Negative 39308 pAs MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.data.entity.dbcontextvvs.103.aspx relnofollowconfirmsa, in EF 5 and on, the DbContext class is a combination of the UnitOfWork and Repository patterns.  In the web applications I build, I tend to implement the Repository and UnitOfWork patterns on top of the existing DbContext class.  Lately, like many others out there, Ive found that this is overkill in my scenario.  I am not worried about the underlying storage mechanism ever changing from SQL Server, and while I appreciate the benefits that unit testing would bring, I still have a lot to learn about it before actually implementing it in a live application.p  pThus, my solution is to use the DbContext class directly as the Repository and UnitOfWork, and then use StructureMap to inject one instance per request to individual service classes, allowing them to do work on the context.  Then in my controllers, I inject each service I need and call the methods necessary by each action accordingly.

Negative 39308 pAs it is good known, elements which are inserted to the priority queue have a value which determines its priority. For example if I have five elements codeA,B,C,D,Ecode with priorities lets call this priority values codepriorityIcode codeA  10, B  5, C  1, D  3, E  2code. But how can I write a priority queue where I can define two priority values, I mean if two elements has the same value of codepriorityIcode, then value codepriorityIIcode decides which element should be taken first, like for examplep  precodeelement A has priorityI  3, and prioriotyII  5 element B has priorityI  3, and prioriotyII  1 codepre  pthen first element B will be taken from the queue first.p

endTurn value which will then cause the listener to call on the progressTurn method and the cycle continuesp

Everything I see explains how to use a variable for j i.e. column names, but not for i. p  pWhen I just put the name of the variable in, i.e.p  precodesetkeydtpredictions, colA, colB nextweek  dtpredictions[Juservar, weekvar] codepre  pit returns the entire table. Trying to apply the answer to FAQ 1.6, I triedp  precode  nextweek  dtpredictions[Jevalquoteuservar, evalquoteweekvar]  codepre  pand p  precode nextweek  dtpredictions[Jevaluser, evalweek] codepre  pbut both still returned the whole table. p  pI am pretty sure this is very simple, but I am stuck. p  pstrongEDITstrong I apologize for not clarifying earlier I would like to do a binary search, since I need the speedup. I know that I can do a vector scan using , but I would prefer not to.p

Negative 39308 pI have 3 fragments in a ViewPager Activity. All 3 fragments have input fields. Here I am trying to pass first two fragments data to third fragment. I read few posts here and most of them suggested to use interfacesi.e. to pass data through parent activity I have also gone through this link a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfragmentscommunicating.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfragmentscommunicating.htmlap  pInterface using interfaces is good approach when we are sending data through some user event. Here I am trying to send data without any user event. Hence I thought of onPause since onPause is always called. But ViewPager functions differently. When a fragment is loaded,the adjacent fragments are also loaded. I would be successful to pass data between 1st fragment to 3rd fragment. But 2nd fragments onPause wont be called unless I am navigating to some fragment that is not adjacent to itwhich in my case is not therep  pSetterGettersI have read in few posts people saying not to use settergettersI still havent understood the reason yet a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions565095aregettersandsetterspoordesignAre getters and setters poor designap  pBundle I havent considered this yet.

Negative 39308 pFirst off let me explain the desired behavior, and then I will provide examples of what I have tried. The UI I am trying to build contains a fixed sidebar that does not scrollcolxs2. The rest of the contentcolxs10 should be able to scroll. When the browser is resized to lt 480 the sidebar should jump to the top and now become a horizontal navBar. The content below should still be able to scroll but the navBar should remain fixed at the top. By changing the bootstrap classes via javascript I was able to achieve a version of this. For examplep  precode        window.addEventListenerresize, function event           var width  event.target.innerWidth         var element  document.getElementByIdnavBar           if width lt 480            element.classList.removenavstacked           else            element.classList.addnavstacked           codepre  pSo at resolution  480 the markup would look like thisp  precode ltdiv classnav navpills navstacked navbarfixedtop colsm2 colxs3 idnavBargt codepre  pAnd at resolution lt 480 the markup would dynamically change to thisp  precodeltdiv classnav navpills navbarfixedtop colsm2 colxs3 idnavBargt codepre  pI feel as though there is a much cleaner way of doing this which doesnt involve me dynamically addingremove bootstrap classes from the DOM. p  pBelow is an example of my most recent attemptp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netRobbyChaps59k5s3kaembeddedresult relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netRobbyChaps59k5s3kaembeddedresultap  h1strongUpdatestrongh1  pHere is another attempt at solving this issue.

However, I am still curious to see if there is a more efficient solution.p

Negative 39308 pI have a collection in my Mongo Database called codeWorkOrdercode with 2 fields codeDateCompletecode and codeDateDuecode. Using those 2 fields Id like to use the aggregation framework to count the number of Late Work Orders by comparing the two fields. However the research Ive found hasnt had any useful ways to format the query so that the Late Work Orders will be filtered through. Does anyone know of a way to format a Mongo DB Aggregation Query preferably in PHP that can compare 2 fields in the collectionp  pEDIT p  pAn example entry in WorkOrder might look likep  pidp  psome mongo idp  pDateDuep  p20141010p  pDateCompletedp  p20141012p  pThis entry would want to be filtered through since DateCompleted is greater than DateDue.

To explain what Im ultimately trying to accomplishp  pWe have 200 users who need to complete training monthly. Many of the users are spread out across 4 sites not local to home, the remaining users are here at home. The training needs to be documented. So, instead of sending out an email saying Read this and reply to me saying youve read it I dont want to get 200 emails every month, I decided a SharePoint list would be the easiest way.p  pTo minimize the impact on the user, I want to send out a spreadsheet, InfoPath form, or whatever else may work where they simply need to put their name and the date they completed the training. They then click the submit button, and it adds the data theyve typed into the form or spreadsheet to the list. They do NOT need to see the rest of the names added to the list already this is how the tutorial I followed set it up but, if theres no other way then so be it.p

Negative 39308 pI need to allow users to login website either with their Active Directory accounts if they are in local network Sitecores single signon functionality or with their credentials email and social security number if they access site being outside local network.  p  pFirst option could be achieved by enabling Windows Authentication mode in IIS and second  by using Anonymous mode. But it is impossible to enable these two modes at the same time for one site. So the question is how to configure website in IIS to allow both groups of users login it with appropriate option and do not create different site for each optionp  pAny good ideas are appreciated.p

Negative 39308 pI want to get rid of a runtime cast to a generic codeasInstanceOf[A]code without implicit conversions.p  pThis happens when I have a fairly clean data model consisting of case classes with a common trait and want to implement a generic algorithm on it. As an example the resulting algorithm should take a class of type codeAcode that is a subclass of the codetrait Tcode and is supposed to return a copy of the concrete class codeAcode with some updated field. p  pThis is easy to achieve when I can simply add an abstract codecopycodemethod to the base trait and implement that in all subclasses. However this potentially pollutes the model with methods only required by certain algorithms and is sometimes not possible because the model could be out of my control.p  pHere is a simplified example to demonstrate the problem and a solution using runtime casts. p  pPlease dont get hung up on the details. p  pSuppose there is a trait and some case classes I cant changep  precodetrait Share    def absolute Int     case class CommonShare     issuedOn String,      absolute Int,      percentOfCompany Float    extends Share  case class PreferredShare     issuedOn String,      absolute Int,      percentOfCompany Float   extends Share codepre  pAnd here is a simple method to recalculate the current codepercentOfCompanycode when the total number of shares have changed and update the field in the case classp  precodedef recalculateShare[A lt Share]share A, currentTotalShares Int A      def copyOfShareWithnewPercentage Float       share match        case common CommonShare gt common.copypercentOfCompany  newPercentage       case preferred PreferredShare gt preferred.copypercentOfCompany  newPercentage            copyOfShareWithshare.absolute  currentTotalShares.toFloat.asInstanceOf[A]  codepre  pSome example invocations on the REPLp  precodescalagt recalculateShareCommonShare20140101, 100, 0.5f, 400 res0 CommonShare  CommonShare20140101,100,0.25  scalagt recalculateSharePreferredShare20140101, 50, 0.5f, 400 res1 PreferredShare  PreferredShare20140101,50,0.125 codepre  pSo it works and as far as I understand the code.asInstanceOf[A]code call will never fail but is required to make the code compile. Is there a way to avoid the runtime cast in a typesafe manner without implicit conversionsp

Negative 39308 pA transaction in an Oracle db makes changes in the db, and the changes are committed. Is it possible that other transactions see the performed changes only after several seconds, not immediatelyp  pstrongBackgroundstrong We have an application that performs db changes, commits them, and THEN immediately it reads the changed data back from the database. However, sometimes it happens that it finds no changes. When the same read is repeated later by executing the same select manually from SQL Developer, the changed data are returned correctly. The db is standalone, not clustered.p  pThe application does not communicate with the database directly, that would be easy, several layers including MQ messaging are involved. Weve already eliminated other potential causes of the behaviour like incorrect parameters, caching etc.. Now Id like to eliminate an unexpected behaviour of the Oracle db as the cause.p  pstrongEditstrong At first, Id like to emphasize that Im NOT asking whether uncommited changes can be visible to other sessions. At second, the Oracle COMMIT statement has several modifiers, like WRITE BATCH or NOWAIT. I dont know whether these modifiers can have any influence on the answer to my questions, but we are not using them anyway.p

The issue I have is if I increase the concurrency of celery to anything over 1 they crash in less than a minute. I had this issue previously and was able to adjust the buffer limits on the Redis server values below. Now with so many messages the issue has come back. Any ideas on how to fix this would be appreciated.p  precodeclientoutputbufferlimit slave 512mb 256mb 60 clientoutputbufferlimit pubsub 256mb 128mb 60 codepre  pAlso, everything is hosted in AWS on large EC2 instances.p

This only happens when Im debugging and when I do a step over.  If i set a breakpoint after the put is executed, everything is fine.p  pI have referred to other, similar questions without resolution.p  pMy question is, is there something Im doing in this particular handler on this particular microsoft WebApi controller that could cause this exception only on Android 5, only when debugging and only on step over  Or is it something with android or android studio  Its very strange to me that other puts are working and only this one is failing and only on Android 5.p  pTo sum up, this only happens on Android 5, in debugger, on step over of only this one put.  If i set a breakpoint and step over other puts to the same server, its fine.  If I set a breakpoint and step over this put on android devices running android 4, its fine.p  pIf it helps, the message which goes with the exception is No peer certificatep

I am wondering if there is a way to prevent this andor disable the hover during the slide out animationp  pSidebar asp.netp  precodeltdiv classcolsm3 colmd2 sidebar slidergt       lth5 stylefontfamily Helvetica texttransform uppercasegtReleaseslth5gt      ltaspCheckBoxList runatserver IDreleaseStatusFilter AutoPostBacktrue RepeatDirectionHorizontal CellPadding6 Height5 stylemarginleft10pxgt      ltaspListItem TextFuture Value Future SelectedtruegtltaspListItemgt      ltaspListItem TextCurrent Value Current SelectedtruegtltaspListItemgt      ltaspListItem TextCompleted Value Completed SelectedfalsegtltaspListItemgtltaspCheckBoxListgt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt      ltaspListView runatserver IDreleaseList stylefloatleftgt          ltItemTemplategt              ltul classnav navbar navsidebar goocollapsible gt                  ltligtlta hreflt Release.aspxrn EvalreleaseNumber gtgtlt EvalreleaseNumber     EvalreleaseShortName gtltagtltligt              ltulgt              ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                  var param  location.search.splitrn[1]                  param  param.split20.join                   ul.finda[hrefRelease.aspxrn  param  ].parentsli.addClassactive              ltscriptgt         ltItemTemplategt     ltaspListViewgt ltdivgt codepre  pcssp  precode.sidebar      display none   media minwidth 768px      .sidebar          fontsize 12px         position fixed         top 120px         width 175px         bottom 0         left 0px         display block         padding 10px         overflowx hidden         overflowy auto  Scrollable contents if viewport is shorter than content.          backgroundcolor ccc         borderright 1px solid eeeeee         webkitanimation bannermoveout 0.5s linear both         animation bannermoveout 0.5s linear both        keyframes bannermoveout      0          transform translate3d0px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easein           50          transform translate3d92px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout           100          transform translate3d185px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout        webkitkeyframes bannermoveout      0          transform translate3d0px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easein           50          transform translate3d92px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout           100          transform translate3d185px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout        .sidebarhover      webkitanimation bannermove 0.5s linear both     animation bannermove 0.5s linear both   keyframes bannermove      0          transform translate3d185px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easein           50          transform translate3d92px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout           100          transform translate3d0px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout        webkitkeyframes bannermove      0          transform translate3d185px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easein           50          transform translate3d92px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout           100          transform translate3d0px, 0px, 0px         animationtimingfunction easeinout       codepre  pSo i managed to fix it by using jquery to animate the sidebar menu instead of css.

In many frameworks, BDD Tests scenarios are created by the skateholders, with a DSL. BDD Tests tend to converge to exclusive Infrastructure Ignorant practices. On the other hand, Integration Tests are supposed to verify that the solution matches the target infrastructure they are done by DevOps , and only the infrastructure. When business functions are distributed over microservices, you should mock almost everything infra and business in your BDD Tests environment it should be the local environment and mocking business weakens a lot your goals.

Negative 39308 pThe reverse of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions752844whatwouldbethenegativeeffectsofinstallinga32bitappintothecprogramthis questiona.p  pMy .NET C program sets the Platform Target as Any CPU, which on my 64 bit Win7 OS, means it will run as 64 bit. Even when the program is stored under Program Files x86, it will still run as 64 bit interestingly I checked with codeIntPtr.Size  8code.p  pSo should I expect anything bad to happen The program references a DLL which is also Any CPU, but thats all. I would rather install it to the Program Files x86 folder for maintenance reasons if nothing else.p  pAnd would anything bad happen if this wasnt .NET, and just a standard CC executablep

Negative 39308 pI have a codeUITableViewcode which gets its data from a Core Data stack.

Negative 39308 pI know that I can add a codeclickcode or codechangecode listener on a checkbox. The handler changes the codedisabledcode codepropcodeof a button to codetruecode when the checkbox is unchecked. Thats easy. p  pBut rather than having this be eventdriven, is there a way to have this be state drivenp  pIf the state of the checkbox is unchecked, the state of the button will always be disabled. It doesnt matter what kind of event triggers the state change. If the checkbox is in one state, then the button is always in a corresponding state. Thats it.p  pHeres an example of standard eventdriven code where a checkout button should be disabled as long as the terms and conditions checkbox is unchecked.p  precode  input[nametermsandconditons].changefunctione, tmpl     ife.target.checked  true       checkoutbutton.propdisabled, false      else        checkoutbutton.propdisabled, true         codepre  pUnfortunately this doesnt take into account initial states, since it requires an event to happen for something else to happen. On page load, if the checkbox is unchecked, the button could still be enabled, unless care is taken to remember to set the initial state of the button to disabledp  precode   setting the initial state   checkoutbutton.propdisabled, true   input[nametermsandconditons].propchecked, false    input[nametermsandconditons].changefunctione, tmpl     ife.target.checked  true       checkoutbutton.propdisabled, false      else        checkoutbutton.propdisabled, true         codepre  pIm wondering if there is a way to create a state listener. No matter what event happens even if there isnt an event, like a default value on pageload, the button state will always be in lockstep with the checkbox state. It could be changed via a click, space key press, change event, someone just editing the HTML directly in Chrome Console, or it might just initially load in some kind of state. The point is that things just emareem. And the state of certain things can automatically change with the state of those other things.p

Negative 39308 pHad a question  this is more hard disk related not solid state drive  but pertains to Ubuntu. I have recently made a shell script which captures 3 cameras 2 IP cams, 1 USB cam and merges the images with ImageMagick. I recently rewrote the shell script to store temporary files in devshm so I reduce disk writes and am able to capture at slightly faster intervals. Right now its running every 4 to 7 seconds. This creates well over 10,000 JPEG files per day. I have a nightly script which takes all these JPEGs, moves them to memory, renames them to 05d format, and converts them to a MP4 file back on disk. This saves significant space as the JPEGs take up 23 GB  day while the MP4s only take up around 200225 MBs.p  pI am concerned about those 10,000 writes per day though, and that killing my 2 TB Seagate Barracuda drive andor the motherboards SATA controller. I specifically opted to avoid Solid State drives like the plague because of this concern as they have known write limitations and the fact they are overpriced  2x 2 TB platter drives was only 130, but am curious to if frequent writes wear down a conventional platter drive as well.p  pAs a precaution since I have a script that generates GIFs every minute, I have for now set it to store all the captures in memory and only dump to disk once a minute.p  pThe question  again  is I am curious to if frequent writes wear down a conventional platter drive as well.p  pAsking in hardware as previous question in Linux was voted closed.p

Negative 39308 pI have seen this question pop up a few times while searching but none seem to solve my problem. My countdown timer runs in a service and works perfectly fine except for the fact it has a delay before reaching onFinish. It will go 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,long pause onFinish. This problem,however does not occur when I am using the debugger mode from android studio on my device. When the device is not connected to the debugger, my app experiences a delay in time. Is there any way to remove fix problem while still using the countdown timer Other solutions I saw involved the use of handlers or runnables, but I prefer to say with the countdown timer.

I cant seem to verify this through any documentation one of my main grievances with C thus far, somewhat harder to find easy to understand documentation. to confirm this. p  pI would like to ensure that Im understanding the program correctly, as its a purely inductive approach and Im unsure as to why these flags would be stored as such. Could somebody verify these findings, or point out something I may be overlookingp  pEx. p  precodetty.ccflag hypothetically is 4bits long, each of the flags from the previous code block corresponding to bits 3, 2, 1, 0.

Negative 39308 pIn my Laravel app Im using Laravel 5.1, but this issue exists in Laravel 4 as well, I have a page for user settings.  When a user updates their status from an undergrad to a graduate student and click submit, the variable storing this status gets changed in the database.  p  pMy app then takes the user to a confirmation page saying their user settings were updated successfully. p  pHowever, on that page, I have a condition in the view which determined what menus are next displayed.  I have one set of menus for users who are undergrads, and another set of menus for users who are graduate studentsp  precodeifAuthusergtstatus  graduate     includegraduatemenus else     includeundergradmenus endif  codepre  pFor some reason, Authuser still returns the previous value it had stored for the status variable.  If I click refresh on the page, then Authuser returns the correct value.  p  pI have temporarily fixed the problem by using Javascript to automatically refresh the page once.  However, its an ugly hack and I would like to understand what I am doing wrong that Authuser is not returning the value that was updated in the previous pages POST and if there is a way to fix it.  I think I might have to refresh the Session somehow, but I do not know how.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 39308 pWith codestdatomiccode, there seems to be no standardscompliant way to sometimes readwrite without atomicity. Boost has interlocked operations, but they are in the codedetailscode namespace so I dont think Im supposed to use it. But I dont know all of boost. Is there something in boost or stl that I could use Or perhaps a proposal which would address this, like maybe adding a codestdmemoryordernosynchronizationcode Or access an abstraction of the interlocked machineryp  pIt seems like the need for this would appear in many designs. Objects that require threadsafety might be held temporarily in a singlethreaded context, making atomic access superfluous. For example, when first constructing an object, it would usually be visible only on the thread creating it, until placed somewhere accessible to multiple threads. So long as your object is only reachable by a single thread, you wouldnt need codestdatomiccodes safety at all. But then once ready, youd publish it to other threads, and suddenly you need locking and enforced atomic access.p  pIn this particular application, Im building large lockless trees. During construction, there is just zero need for interlocked, so the existing design which calls osprovided interlocked functions does not use interlocked until it becomes necessary. After it becomes visible to other threads, all threads should be using an interlocked view. I cant port to codestdatomiccode without introducing a bunch of pointless synchronization.p  pThe best I can even think of now is to use codestdmemoryorderrelaxedcode, but on ARM, this is still not the same as nonatomic access. On x86amd64 it is though. Another hack is placement new on codestdatomiccode, which writes a new value without atomicity, but that doesnt provide any way to read back the value nonatomically.p
