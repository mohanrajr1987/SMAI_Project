Positive 201 pemThis question is language independent. Lets not worry about frameworks or implementation, lets just say everything can be implemented and lets look at REST API in an abstract way. In other words Im building a framework right now and I didnt see any solution to this problem anywhere.emp  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow one can construct REST URL endpoint for intersection of two independent REST paths which return collections Short example How to intersect codeusers1commentscode and codecompanies6commentscodep  pstrongConstraintstrongp  pAll endpoints should return single data model entity or collection of entities.p  pImho this is a very reasonable constraint and all examples of Hypermedia APIs look like this, even in a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmldraftkellyjsonhal07 relnofollowdraftkellyjsonhal07a.p  pIf you think this is an invalid constraint or you know a better way please let me know.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pSo lets say we have an application which has three data types codeproductscode, codecategoriescode and codecompaniescode. Each company can add some products to their profile page. While adding the product they must attach a category to the product. For example we can access this kind of data like thisp  ul licodeGET categoriescode will return collection of all categoriesli licodeGET categories9code will return category of id 9li licodeGET categories9productscode will return all products inside category of id 9li licodeGET companies7productscode will return all products added to profile page of company of id 7li ul  pemIve omitted codelinkscode hypermedia part on purpose because it is straightforward, for example codecode gives codelinkscode to codecategoriescode and codecompaniescode etc. We just need to remember that by using hypermedia we are traversing relations graph.emp  pHow to write URL that will return all products that are from company7 and are of category9 In otherwords how to intersect codecategories9productscode and codecompanies7productscodep  pAssuming that all endpoints should represent data model resource or collection of them I believe this is a fundamental problem of REST Hypermedia API, because in traversing hypermedia api we are traversing relational graph going down one path so it is impossible to describe such intersection because it is a crosssection of two independent graph paths.p  pIn other words I think we cannot represent two independent paths with only one path. Normally we traverse one path like codeAgtBgtCcode, but if we have codeXgtYcode and codeZgtYcode and we want all codeYcodes that come from codeXcode and codeZcode then we have a problem.p  pSo far my proposition is to use query strings codecategories9productsintersectcompanies9code but can we do betterp  pstrongWhy do I want thisstrongp  pBecause Im building a framework which will autogenerate REST Hypermedia API based on SQL database relations. You could think of it as a trans compiler of URLs to codeSELECT ... JOIN ... WHEREcode queries, but the client of the API only sees Hypermedia and the client would like to have a nice way of doing intersections, like in the example.p

Positive 201 pHi I am creating mobile native application that uses REST API endpoints to communicate with server side.br I have had previous experience developing native clients, but I have simple token random generated string stored in DB in the same table where user information is stored. So it is like sessions used in browser, but instead of cookies each request has token in the header.    p  pRecently I discoreved JWT token. It seems to be great way to secure endpoints which are private. You can request token from mobile client providing you pass  login and get generated token in response.br But the one important thing is that this token is not stored anywhere on the server, server verifies the token using secret word, which is private for the server like private key.br Thats okay for secured endpoints, but what to do if I require user session, for example how do apps like Facebook, Amazon, Aliexpress ... work, they have ability to use the app without providing credentials, just navigating through the store, but require logining in when user wantt to make purchase. And after that user session is kept for some time. This can be implemented with the JWT token without any problems, but when user need to logout, what to do in this case  Token is not stored anywhere on the server, so how can I destroy this token, to make it invalid  p  pIf token is stored in the database, API is not stateless, as REST API should be.  So in general there is no way to keep user logged in in stateless API, am I right     p  pI have some ideas how to implement this using JWT token, but again this will not be stateless API, as I understand.p  ol liCreate the list of expired tokens   li liStore JWT token in the database, but what is the purpose of self descriptive token JWT in this case if it is stored in the database, the main idea of JWT token to keep all information with token, as I know.li ol  pPlease suggest what is the best way will be in this case, and correct me if I have mistaken.br Thanks.p

Negative 201 pOur current project does not use Hibernate for various reasons and we are using Springs SimpleJdbc support to perform all our DB operations. We have a utility class  that abstracts all CRUD operations but complex operations are performed using custom SQL queries. p  pCurrently our queries are stored as String constants inside the service classes themselves and are fed to a utility to be execute by the SimpleJdbcTemplate. We are at an impasse where readability has to be balanced with maintainability. SQL code inside the class itself is more maintainable since it resides with the code that uses it. On the other hand if we store these queries in an external file flat or XML the SQL itself would be more readable as compared to escaped java string syntax.p  pHas anyone encountered a similar problem What is a good balance Where do you keep your custom SQL in your projectp  pA sample query is as followsp  precodeprivate static final String FINDALLBYCHEAPESTANDPRODUCTIDS       FROM PRODUCTSKU T n      JOIN n       n          SELECT S.PRODUCTID, n                 MINS.ID as minimumidforprice n            FROM PRODUCTSKU S n           WHERE S.PRODUCTID IN productIds n        GROUP BY S.PRODUCTID, S.SALEPRICE n       FI ON FI.PRODUCTID  T.PRODUCTID AND FI.minimumidforprice  T.ID n      JOIN n       n          SELECT S.PRODUCTID, n                 MINS.SALEPRICE as minimumpriceforproduct n            FROM PRODUCTSKU S n           WHERE S.PRODUCTID IN productIds n        GROUP BY S.PRODUCTID n       FP ON FP.PRODUCTID  T.PRODUCTID AND FP.minimumpriceforproduct  T.saleprice n  WHERE T.PRODUCTID IN productIds codepre  pThis is how it would look like in a flat SQL filep  precodenamedQuery FINDALLBYCHEAPESTANDPRODUCTIDS FROM PRODUCTSKU T  JOIN        SELECT S.PRODUCTID,             MINS.ID as minimumidforprice        FROM PRODUCTSKU S       WHERE S.PRODUCTID IN productIds    GROUP BY S.PRODUCTID, S.SALEPRICE   FI ON FI.PRODUCTID  T.PRODUCTID AND FI.minimumidforprice  T.ID  JOIN        SELECT S.PRODUCTID,             MINS.SALEPRICE as minimumpriceforproduct        FROM PRODUCTSKU S       WHERE S.PRODUCTID IN productIds    GROUP BY S.PRODUCTID   FP ON FP.PRODUCTID  T.PRODUCTID AND FP.minimumpriceforproduct  T.saleprice  WHERE T.PRODUCTID IN productIds codepre

We dont need to know all the reasons why the row was returned. So in the second row of the results example, it is enough to know that codeconditional2code and codeconditional3code were both true. Not knowing the what codeconditional1code value is does not matter. p  pIt is enough to know that at least one conditional was satisfied and what that one conditional was.p  h1emNonoptimal solutionsemh1  pObviously I could do this with a strongUNIONstrong like thisp  precodeselect a.id, TRUE, NULL, NULL from a join b on  a.id  b.mya  join .... where        complex and expensive conditional       AND           conditional 1   UNION select a.id, NULL, TRUE, NULL from a join b on  a.id  b.mya  join .... where        complex and expensive conditional       AND            conditional 2   UNION select a.id, NULL, NULL, TRUE from a join b on  a.id  b.mya  join .... where        complex and expensive conditional       AND            conditional 3  codepre  pBut this would mean thatp  ol lithe common complex and expensive conditional is evaluated 3 times.li lithat all conditionals are evaluated even when another conditional has already satisfied the OR.li lithere would be a maintenance nightmare insuring that the 3 copies of the common complex query are identical  o.k. solvable by constructing sql in code and copying the common string  but that means I would violate another internal standard of all sql not being embedded in java but being in a visibletoDBAs xml fileli ol  pUsing a strongCASE in the selectstrong that duplicates each conditional 1 through 3 avoids the common condition being evaluated 3 times. However, the complexity of conditional 13 is such that it may not be possible.p  pUsing a strongselect in the FROMstrong clause, would be awkward and may not be possible because a FROM  SELECT cannot be a correlated query. I am not certain that I can construct a useful noncorrelated query.p  pstrongStored proceduresstrong would work. However, this would be out first such stored procedure and would increase our deployment complexity significantly.p  pstrongDoing the codeconditional1code, codeconditional2code, codeconditional3code evaluation in java code.strong This is what we are currently doing and it runs sloooooooow. Lots of data transferred when the database is designed to filter the results set  should not be doing this in javap  h1Solution suggestionsh1  pAnyonep  pI should also add that I welcome answers that say this problem cannot be solved.

Negative 201 pMy test uses Selenium to loop through a CSV list of URLs via an HTTP proxy working script below. As I watch the script run I can see about 10 of the calls produce Proxy error 502 BadGateway however, the errors are not captured by my catchall except Exception clause  ie instead of writing error in the appropriate row of the output.csv, they get passed to the else clause and produce a short piece of html that starts Proxy error 502 Read from server failed Unknown error. Also, if I collect all the URLs which returned 502s and rerun the script, they all pass, which leads me to believe that this is a sporadic network path issue. p  pQuestion Can the script be made to recognize the the 502 errors, sleep a minute, and then retry the URL instead of moving on to the next URL in the list p  pThe only alternative that I can think of is to apply re.searchProxy error 502 after gethtmlsource as a way to catch the bad calls.

Negative 201 pAssume I have a reliable UDP library, and want to tunnel arbitrary TCP connections over it. This is my current approach to doing so, but I feel that it may not be very efficient. Any suggestions are very welcome.p  ol liClient establishes a reliable UDP connection to server.li liClient runs a local SOCKS5 proxy, which receives data from any app that connects to it and forwards it through the reliable UDP connection. Each packet includes a 4byte id unique to each SOCKS connection.li liServer receives data. If the 4byte id is new, it makes a new connection to its local TCP socket and sends the data, and spawns a new thread which receives any replies from the server and forwards them through the reliable UDP connection with the appropriate id. If the 4byte id is old, it simply sends the data over the existing TCP connection.li liClient receives data, sending it over the existing SOCKS connection to whatever app started it.li ol  pRight now, this seems to work for making simple HTML requests from a browser, but since the server isnt directly connected to the client, it is unable to tell when the client terminates a connection.

In addition I have some controls which allows the user to filter the items in that codeItemsControlcode.p  pWhat Im trying to do is to make it better visible to the user which items are removed when the filter is applied.p  pSo what I did was instead of really filtering the codeICollectionViewcode, I introduced a new property codeIsVisiblecode on the VM used for each item.

Negative 201 pIm in the midst of testing a user control Ive built, and Im encountering something thats inexplicable to me.  p  pThe controls an extension of the ComboBox that handles values of a specific custom type.  It has a dependency property of that custom type that is the target property of a Binding.p  pIve got a trace statement in the setter, and I can see that the property is getting set.  But its not appearing in my user control.p  pNow, ordinarily Id say, okay, Ive got a bug in my user control.  I probably do, though Im baffled about it.  But this question isnt about finding the bug in my control.  Read on here is where it gets weird.p  pIm also using Bea Stollnitzs little value converter to help debug the Bindingp  precodepublic class DebuggingConverter  IValueConverter      public object Convertobject value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture              return value  Add the breakpoint here          public object ConvertBackobject value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture              throw new NotImplementedExceptionThis method should never be called       codepre  pThe idea behind this is that I add this converter to my Binding and can set a breakpoint to see what value is being pushed out to the target.  Okay, that works just fine.  I can see that the value is being pushed out.p  pIn fact, it works a little emtooem fine.  If the DebuggingConverter is attached to the Binding, the user control displays the value.  If its not, it doesnt.p  pHow is that even possible  How could a value converter that does nothing affect the behavior of a bound controlp  pstrongEditstrongp  pNot that its likely to help, but heres the XAML for the user controlp  precodeltaCodeLookupBox     Grid.Column1     Grid.IsSharedSizeScopeTrue     MinWidth100     StyleBinding Stylegt     ltaCodeLookupBox.CodeLookupTablegt         ltBinding PathCodes ModeOneWaygt     ltaCodeLookupBox.CodeLookupTablegt     ltaCodeLookupBox.SelectedCodegt         ltBinding PathValue ModeTwoWay ValidatesOnDataErrorsTruegt     ltaCodeLookupBox.SelectedCodegt ltaCodeLookupBoxgt codepre  pWithout the converter on the second binding, the control behaves as though I didnt set codeSelectedCodecode.  Even though a trace statement in the codeOnSelectedCodePropertyChangedcode handler shows that codee.Valuecode does indeed contain the correct value.  This happens irrespective of whether the converters attached or not.p  pIve been trying to reverseengineer this problem with a thought experiment  if you wanted to create a bound user control whose behavior changed if a noop converter were attached to its binding, how would you do it  I dont know enough about binding to come up with an answer.p

Negative 201 pI am writing the firmware for an embedded device in C using the Silicon Labs IDE and the SDCC compiler. The device architecture is based on the 8051 family.  The function in question is shown below. The function is used to set the ports on my MCU to drive a stepper motor. It gets called in by an interrupt handler. The big switch statement just sets the ports to the proper value for the next motor step. The bottom part of the function looks at an input from a hall effect sensor and a number of steps moved in order to detect if the motor has stalled.  The problem is, for some reason the second IF statement that looks like this codeif StallDetector gt GapSize  20                                              HandleStallEvent                     code always seems to get optimized out.

Negative 201 pIm trying to find a cleaner alternative that is idiomatic to Scala to the kind of thing you see with databinding in WPFsilverlight databinding  that is, implementing INotifyPropertyChanged. First, some backgroundp  pIn .Net WPF or silverlight applications, you have the concept of twoway databinding that is, binding the value of some element of the UI to a .net property of the DataContext in such a way that changes to the UI element affect the property, and vise versa. One way to enable this is to implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface in your DataContext. Unfortunately, this introduces a lot of boilerplate code for any property you add to the ModelView type. Here is how it might look in Scalap  precodetrait IDrawable extends INotifyPropertyChanged            protected var drawOrder  Int  0       def DrawOrder  Int  drawOrder       def DrawOrdervalue  Int              ifdrawOrder  value                    drawOrder  value                   OnPropertyChangedDrawOrder                            protected var visible  Boolean  true       def Visible  Boolean  visible       def Visiblevalue Boolean               ifvisible  value                    visible  value                   OnPropertyChangedVisible                           def Mutate  Unit             ifVisible                DrawOrder  1  Should trigger the PropertyChanged Event of INotifyPropertyChanged trait                    codepre  pFor the sake of space, lets assume the INotifyPropertyChanged type is a trait that manages a list of callbacks of type AnyRef, String  Unit, and that OnPropertyChanged is a method that invokes all those callbacks, passing this as the AnyRef, and the passedin String. This would just be an event in C. p  pYou can immediately see the problem thats a ton of boilerplate code for just two properties. Ive always wanted to write something like this insteadp  precodetrait IDrawable        val Visible  new ObservableProperty[Boolean]Visible, true       val DrawOrder  new ObservableProperty[Int]DrawOrder, 0       def Mutate  Unit             ifVisible                DrawOrder  1  Should trigger the PropertyChanged Event of ObservableProperty class                    codepre  pI know that I can easily write it like this, if ObservableProperty[T] has ValueValue methods this is the method Im using nowp  precodetrait IDrawable         on a side note, is there some way to get a Symbol representing the Visible field        on the following line, instead of hardcoding it in the ObservableProperty         constructor       val Visible  new ObservableProperty[Boolean]Visible, true       val DrawOrder  new ObservableProperty[Int]DrawOrder, 0       def Mutate  Unit             ifVisible.Value                DrawOrder.Value  1                       given this implementation of ObservableProperty[T] in my library  note IEvent, Event, and EventArgs are classes in my library for  handling lists of callbacks  they work similarly to events in C class PropertyChangedEventArgsval PropertyName Symbol extends EventArgs class ObservableProperty[T]val PropertyName Symbol, private var value T      protected val propertyChanged  new Event[PropertyChangedEventArgs]     def PropertyChanged IEvent[PropertyChangedEventArgs]  propertyChanged     def Value  value     def Valuevalue T          ifthis.value  value              this.value  value             propertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgsPropertyName                codepre  pBut is there any way to implement the first version using implicits or some other featureidiom of Scala to make ObservableProperty instances function as if they were regular properties in scala, without needing to call the Value methods The only other thing I can think of is something like this, which is more verbose than either of the above two versions, but is still less verbose than the originalp  precodetrait IDrawable         private val visible  new ObservableProperty[Boolean]Visible, false   def Visible  visible.Value   def Visiblevalue Boolean Unit   visible.Value  value     private val drawOrder  new ObservableProperty[Int]DrawOrder, 0   def DrawOrder  drawOrder.Value   def DrawOrdervalue Int Unit   drawOrder.Value  value     def Mutate  Unit       ifVisible        DrawOrder  1           codepre

Negative 201 pstrongREAD FIRSTstrong I have rewritten this question with the help of a friend to be hopefully more specific in what is required. It can be found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3004054chowtogeneratethesetofcartesianproductofndimensionaltupleshereap  pIm not very clear on ncubes, but I believe they are what I am referring to as the square family.p  pstrongNew Question Wordingstrongbr Perhaps I wasnt clear enough. What Im asking, is how to set a 1D array to hold data for a cloud of a number of evenlyspaced points that form the most complete representation of the space occupied by an ncube of n dimensions. p  pIn 1D this would simply fill the array with a series of 1D coordinates creating a line segment. A 1cube.p  pIn 2D however this would fill every first coordinate to the x value and the every second to the y, generating the most complete square possible for that spacing and number of particles. The most complete possible 2cube.p  pIn 3D, this would fill ever first with x, every second with y and every third with z, generating the most complete possible cube for that spacing and number of particles. The most complete possible 3cube.p  pI wish to be able to do this for any reasonable combination of number of particles, spacing and dimensions. Ideally I could do at least up to a 4cube using a generic fill algorithm for all ncubes initialised to codedouble  partscodep  pYet another definition of what kind of object Im trying to representbr In 1D its a line. Sweep it through the second dimension it becomes a square. Sweep that square through the third, it becomes a cube. I presume this behaviour extends past three dimensions and wish to store a cloud of points representing the space taken up by one of these objects of any reasonable dimension, spacing and number of points in a 1D array.p  pstrongThe original wording of the questionstrongbr Im struggling to find a good way to put this question but here goes. Im making a system that uses a 1D array implemented as codedouble  parts  new double[somevariable]code.  I want to use this to hold coordinates for a particle system that can run in various dimensions.p  pWhat I want to be able to do is write a generic fill algorithm for filling this in ndimensions with a common increment in all direction to a variable size. Examples will serve best I think.p  pConsider the case where the number of particles stored by the array is 4p  pIn 1D this produces 4 elements in the array because each particle only has one coordinate.br 1Dbr code0, 25, 50, 75codebr In 2D this produces 8 elements in the array because each particle has two coordinates..br 2Dbr code0, 0, 0, 25, 25, 0, 25, 25codebr In 3D this produces 12 elements in the array because each particle now has three coordinatesbr code0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 25, 0, 0, 50, ... code  p  pThese examples are still not quite accurate, but they hopefully will suffice.p  pThe way I would do this normally for two dimensions  p  precodeint i  0  forint x  0 x lt partssize  dims  dims  25 x  25        forint y  0 y lt partssize  dims  dims  25 y  25           parts[i]  x         parts[i1]  y         i2       codepre  pHow can I implement this for ndimensions where 25 can be any numberp  pThe straight line part is because it seems to me logical that a line is a somewhat regular shape in 1D, as is a square in 2D, and a cube in 3D. It seems to me that it would follow that there would be similar shapes in this family that could be implemented for 4D and higher dimensions via a similar fill pattern. This is the shape I wish to set my array to represent.p  pEDIT Apparently Im trying to fill this array to represent the ncube with the fewest missing elements for the given n, spacing and number of elements. If that makes my goal any clearer.p

Negative 201 pI need some advice on the pro and cons of certain image strategies.

Lets take for example a page that mimics a review of a product. You may have a normal sized product shot and multiple different sized thumbnails.p  pTwo techniques to tackle this could be, using the product shot and creating all necessary thumbnails by copying the original image and then resizing or cropping it to all desired sizes, or one could create those different sized thumbnails on demand by resizing them whenever necessary and sending a temporary image to the client.p  pHas anyone got any other experiences of how this could be implemented, or any pros and cons of the ways discussed abovep  pThanks,p

Negative 201 pIm trying to write a method that will return a Hibernate object based on a unique but nonprimary key.  If the entity already exists in the database I want to return it, but if it doesnt I want to create a new instance and save it before returning.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Let me clarify that the application Im writing this for is basically a batch processor of input files.  The system needs to read a file line by line and insert records into the db.  The file format is basically a denormalized view of several tables in our schema so what I have to do is parse out the parent record either insert it into the db so I can get a new synthetic key, or if it already exists select it.  Then I can add additional associated records in other tables that have foreign keys back to that record.p  pThe reason this gets tricky is that each file needs to be either totally imported or not imported at all, i.e. all inserts and updates done for a given file should be a part of one transaction.  This is easy enough if theres only one process thats doing all the imports, but Id like to break this up across multiple servers if possible.  Because of these constraints I need to be able to stay inside one transaction, but handle the exceptions where a record already exists.p  pThe mapped class for the parent records looks like thisp  precodeEntity public class Foo      Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  IDENTITY     private int id     Columnunique  true     private String name     ...  codepre  pMy initial attempt at writting this method is as followsp  precodepublic Foo findOrCreateString name      Foo foo  new Foo     foo.setNamename     try          session.savefoo      catchConstraintViolationException e          foo  session.createCriteriaFoo.class.addeqname, name.uniqueResult          return foo  codepre  pThe problem is when the name Im looking for exists, an org.hibernate.AssertionFailure exception is thrown by the call to uniqueResult.

This needs to work in a distributed environment so I cant synchronize across the check to see if the record already exists and the insert.  The easiest way to do this is to let the database handle this synchronization by checking for the constraint violation on every insert.p

Negative 201 pFrom reading the LibTIFF source code, it appears to me that the a hrefhttpwww.remotesensing.orglibtiffinternals.html relnofollowmain approacha to customizing LibTIFF is to define new Tags and to implement new Codecs. Also, since LibTIFF is opensource and has a liberal license, users who need to tweak it for various purposes can modify it directly.p  pHowever, there is a kind of customization which doesnt seem to fit into the two approaches to extension I want to install various kinds of event listeners callback functions so that I can detect various conditions that happen inside the existing codecs.p  pExample 1 I want to be able to replace the error  warning message handlers of LibTIFF so that it is threadsafe and sends the messages to a callback function set by the caller.p  pExample 2 Some TIFF images may be missing some tags, and LibTIFF tries to make them up by guessing their values. Sometimes some tags are obviously wrong and LibTIFF tries to correct them. However, I would like to have a callback function which is notified whenever LibTIFF changes the tags value, so that I can log this and generate a report about the images conformance to the standard.p  pExample 3 I need to concatenate several pages of a multipage TIFF together. The pages have the same dimensions and compression parameters. If I have access to the compressed data, then I can do this more efficiently by copying the compressed data verbatim into the strips of a new TIFF image.p  pWhat is the recommended way of adding callback functions  event listeners to LibTIFF, without complicating its architecturep

Negative 201 pI have a UIScrollView, with a UIView in it.p  pI dont know the size of the subview until everything in it that needs to be displayed has been, and this can change on later drawings. It has tables, text etc. that are added bit by bit. So, I need to update the scroll views content size at the point that the subviews drawRect completes.p  pIs there a good way to trigger the required [myScrollView setContentSize] amp [mySubView setNeedsDisplay] this calls drawRect so Ill take steps to avoid infinite loops after the drawRect, or any other solution that actually works for this situationp  pIt seems to need setNeedsDisplay called on the subview before the content size change is acted on. All I have to do is set the setContentSize from the subviews drawRect then I press a button that triggers the setNeedsDisplay, the contentSize then refreshes fine. So I could just set a timer and wait for the next run loop to do the setNeedsDisplay But its an awful hack. Also Im guessing resizing the content size in code called from the subviews drawRect is a nono if UIKit relies on the view hierarchy remaining constant while it is in the middle of drawing the view hierarchy.p

A fast machine for the php, a simple one to serve the static stuff, a large machine for the content. p  pWhy Costs. A static server typically has little need for security against anyone downloading the files. It has little content so no need for an expensive array. Just load it in memory and serve from there. Memory itself can be limitted as well, try it. A PHP server, in my case at least, however will typically need lots of memory, need redundant storage, extensive logging. A content server will need massive storage and massive bandwidth but relatively little in the way of CPU power. Different hardwarehosting requirements for each. Finetuning each not only gives better performance but also reduces hosting costs, for me at least still one of the biggest costs of running a website.p

The post that had the most comments on my feed was something political, so sorry for the ignorance in the data... and as you can see, Unicode chars are converted to codeu0031codeesque, quote marks look like codecode, newlines look like codencode, etc.  p  pThere are also escaped escaped chars, for example one of the comments in the body has codecode because it is the escaped escaped char if that makes sense.  p  pIf those can be converted to their unescaped formate for normal JSON parsing, that would be the best.p  pThank youp
Negative 201 pWhat is the best design for this scenariobr I have different Object types codeUsercode, codeChannelcode, codeMessageBoxcode, codeUserGroupcode, etc.br codeUsercode and codeChannelcode can have permission on other objects. For example codeUsercode has the following enum defined as its permissions for codeMessageBoxcodep  precodeCanRead, CanWrite, CanDelete, ... codepre  pOther enums are defined for codeUsercode as the owner of other object types.  p  pAlso, codeChannelcode has different enum values on these objects. For example, consider codeChannelcode as the owner and codeMessageBoxcode as the object  p  precodeCanDispath CanRetrieve ... codepre  pAll the permissions are saved and retrieved from a specific table in database using bitwise comparison  p  precodeOwnerID........OwnerType........ObjectID........ObjectType........AccessLevel     1              User              10           MessageBox            38        5             Channel            12           MessageBox            18   codepre  pNow in code behind,  Whats the best way to implement permission classes  p  p1 Define codePermissionManagercode, codeUserPermissionManagercode, codeChannelPermissionManagercode classes separately from each other. Other classes just call codePermissionManagercode like   p  precodeif new PermissionManager.HasAccessCurrentUser,                                       CurrentMessageBox,                                      UserPermissions.CanReadMessages   codepre  pThen codePermissionManagercode decides what class this is related to based on the codeOwnerTypecode codeUserPermissionManagercode  or codeChannelPermissionManagercode and calls its codeHasAccesscode method. This way, codePermissionManager.HasAccesscode is always being called and I think it can make the code more maintainable and extensible. This is my preferred solution but since codePermissionManagercode, codeUserPermissionManagercode and codeChannelPermissionManagercode refer to the same context, I think there should be a hierarchy or possibly an interface so these 3 classes become more integrated. But I dont know how to relate them together.p  p2 Define codeIPermissionManagercode interface and implement codeUserPermissionManagercode and codeChannelPermissionManagercode from it. Add codePermissionManagerTypescode enum. Create a factory class and call Managers like  p  precodeIPermissionManager UserManager         PermissionFactory.CreatePermissionsManagerTypes.User if UserManager.HasAccessCurrentUser,                             CurrentMessageBox,                            UserPermissions.CanReadMessages   codepre  pThis is a kind of failed try to relate classes together. But I thought Itd be good to mention it here to let you know what Im trying to achieve.p  pP.S. I cannot define classes as static since they need to have a private variable of type  codeObjectContextcode Entity Framework.  p  pIs there a better solution to achieve thisbr Thank you and Apologies for the very lengthy question.p

Negative 201 pUsing Sitecore.NET 6.3.0. p  pOur Sitecore content has a great deal of items that refer to other items via the control renderings collection. This is done by setting a path to the item as the controls datasource. p  pSince this link is specified via a path  not an id  to the linked item, it is currently possible to break the link if you change the linked items location, or delete it completely. p  pWith the goal of either preventing broken links, or at least detecting them before a publish, what is the best approach to avoiding this problem p  pIm aware that it is possible to link in a standard way reference by id, but this would rule out any links where we must link via relative paths. p  pIs there any way to go about detecting, or even better preventing broken links of this kind p  pEDIT This is more akin to assigning a DataSource to a sublayout in presentation layout details, rather than doing anything in code.

Negative 201 pI have developed a USB device that communicates with linux over a simple but proprietary interface and some custom Linux drivers.  My goal is to port this to Windows without writing windows drivers.  What I would like to do is find an open source or inbuilt class driver for windows that would look like a COM port in Windows.  Then I would tailor the embedded software to match what ever protocol and descriptors the virtual COM port expects to see.  p  pThe idea would be that I could plug my device in to a Windows machine and a relatively high speed COM port would appear with out me having to develop Windows drivers for it. p  pI have been looking at the  USB CDC Communications Device Class documentation and it looks promising, but I dont know which sub interface would be best to use so that it would show up as a COM port.p  pHas anyone here done any work like this before or could provide some insight Specificallyp  ol liAre there virtual COM drivers built in to windows or would I need a 3rd party driver.li liWhich CDC sub class should I use for simple RS232 emulation No need for modem AT commands, etcli liIs there a better option to do what I am trying to do.li ol  pThanksp

Negative 201 pIm developing a BlackBerry app and using J2ME Polish to do the styling. So, Im using TextFields with styling from Polish to get user input.p  pThe TextFields work fine in OS versions other than 6. But when testing on devices running OS 6, the Textfields break.p  pBasically in other versions of the OS, when focus is on a TextField then the left and right buttons move the cursor around in the TextField and up and down moves focus to the nextprevious item.

Negative 201 pI am trying to use some base Abstract classes for a Transaction, Order and an OrderCollection.  TransactionCog inherits Transaction and OrderCollection inherits List and OrderCogCollection inherits OrderCollection and OrderCog inherits Order.  The TransactionCog must have a member of OrderCogCollection.  p  pI am trying to use Transaction to have an abstract Property of OrderCollection so that TransactionCog must override the property but use a type of OrderCogCollection instead.  Of course the way Im going right now is giving me a TransactionCog does not implement inherited abstract member.  p  pIm trying this so that if I have a Widget or Gear to order next, I inherit from the bases and it forces me to override the property with corresponding OrderItemNameCollection.

I did the followingp  precodevar listitem var roleAssgn var Assgn var selectedItems  function readonly      selectedItems  SP.ListOperation.Selection.getSelectedItems     var currentListGuid  SP.ListOperation.Selection.getSelectedList      var context  SP.ClientContext.getcurrent     var currentWeb  context.getweb     var currentList  currentWeb.getlists.getByIdcurrentListGuid       for k in selectedItems          listitem  currentList.getItemByIdselectedItems[k].id         context.loadlistitem, RoleAssignments         context.executeQueryAsyncFunction.createDelegatethis, this.readonlyPerItem, Function.createDelegatethis, this.failed        function readonlyPerItemsender, args      var k     var Assgn     var r   context  SP.ClientContext.getcurrent   roleAssgn  listitem.getroleAssignments    forr in roleAssgn         Assgn  roleAssgn[r]         alert1         context.loadAssgn, RoleDefinitionBindings         alert2         context.executeQueryAsyncFunction.createDelegatethis, this.readonlyPerRoleA, Function.createDelegatethis, this.failed        function readonlyPerRoleAsender, args      var bindings  Assgn.getroleDefinitionBindings     var member  Assgn.getmember   function failedsender, args          alertFAIL  codepre  pThis works great until it gets to the alerts. Alert1 is working, but not Alert2. The Debugger says The object does not support the property geth. And that happens in the spruntime.js withp  blockquote   pSP.DataRetrievalWithExpressionString.1Q0a.geth,dp blockquote  pI dont really see a problem. Is this a bug or is it just not possiblep

Negative 201 pI am new to Java NIO.I have a small doubt. If I use the NIO instead of a socket client, should the server also be using NIO or does it not matterp  pI am concerned about application scalability. I am looking at around 5001000 client requests per seconds per server. Since I would send my data to atleast three different servers, I am ideally looking at around 1500 client requests per second. For this, I already have a socket pool implementation in place which does a fairly decent job. p  pWhat I have is a pool of socket connections for each server.Each thread picks up an available socket connection from the pool and sends it to the serverp  pI am trying to find out if NIO can help or is better in any way than a socket client. How about blocking  Normal client would either block or timeout.p

Negative 201 pI am having a problem with a web app that Im working on and I have posted a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8713814shouldhtml5cachemanifestworkwithajaxrequeststooherea which is a bit vague and probably not very helpful. I have decided to create a really basic site and build it up to be like the main app and see where it breaks. I have done this and got stuck straight away with the offline caching.p  pThis is a basic 3 page static website hosted locally in IIS 7.5. I created the folder cinetpubwwwrootManifestTesting, added it to IIS as a web application and added a new MIME type of textcachemanifest for the .appcache extension.

I click allow, switch the browser to offline mode then attempt to navigate to page1.htm which works fine So all is good so far.p  pNow for the bit that I dont understand. I then created a new folder in the ManifestTesting folder called pages and moved page1 and page2 into it. I updated the links in the index to reference the new location and if I browse the website without the manifest reference, it all works fine just as before.

Negative 201 pI currently have a WCF web API that I have split into two versions. The first version runs at api.mysite.com. The second is currently not published to production.p  pI would like a way to publish the second API such that requests to the first version are noninterrupted. My ideas would be to add a codexapiversioncode header and internally route the request to the designated API. If there is no header, then default to version 1. I considered adding codev1code or codev2code to the beginning of the path to delimit the version such that a request to v1 or v2 might look likep  precodehttpapi.mysite.comv1authenticationlogin httpapi.mysite.comv2authlogin codepre  pThe only caveat is that requests without the version must work and default to version 1 or whatever version I specify. p  pAlthough this sounds good to me at least, Im not sure on what the recommended way of implementing this would be. I know that I could always do some sort of reverse proxy but, Im hoping that my solutions can be a programatic one. The less configuration that is required on the part of the server, the better. If anyone has any ideas or links to blogstutorials, that would be fantasticp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 201 pI am working on an application where users will be evaluating a piece of art and filling out a review form as they go along. They may spend a substantial amount of time on the form, so I want to save it automatically for the user, say every 5 minutes. I was hoping I could use javascript and set a timer for the 5 minutes and then have it basically execute the entire form via ajax and I could save the data to the database in case the user gets disconnected, etc. Unfortunately I cannot seem to find any way to do this. Getting the model updated with the data is not a problem, but I cant figure out how to get it to invoke the method similar to how the action normally would when it was submitted.  I dont want or need it to rerender anything, just let me call a method to save the data. How can I do this  p  pstrongProblems implementing the solutionstrongp  pI tried implementing the solution of the hidden command link but Im getting some very strange behavior. I am not sure what is causing this. First, some background on the implementation.  Form 1 creates a bean None scoped and puts it into the flash, then redirects to Form 2. Form 2 is the big form I was writing about, where I want to implement the autosave. Form 2 has a ViewScoped bean. In the PostConstruct for this bean, it retrieves the value from flash, and populates a property field.  So far so good. This works perfectly without the javascript. I can press the command button to submit the form, and all is well.  However, when I introduce the javascript, when it executes I get a null pointer exception from the variable that should have been populated from the flash by the PostConstruct.  How is this javascript interfering  with that  Once I have populated the property of view scoped bean with the object, it should not matter if its removed from flash scope, right   FYI if I remove ONLY the javascript code and leave everything else it goes back to working fine when I press the button to submit. p  pForm 1 p  precode    lthformgt     ... bunch of form objects ...     lthcommandButton Start New actionsomeRequestScopedBean.someMethodgt     lthformgt codepre  pcode for someRequestScopedBean.Methodp  precode    public String someMethod           bunch of logic here         FacesContext.getCurrentInstance             .getExternalContext                 .getFlash                     .putmyFlashObj, myFlashObj         return form2facesredirecttrue      codepre  pview scoped bean used in form 2p  precode    ManagedBean     ViewScoped     public class someViewScopedBean           bunch of properties here           PostConstruct         public void initialize              this.myObject  MyObject FacesContext.getCurrentInstance                            .getExternalContext                            .getFlash                            .getmyFlashObject         public void saveDraft                save to database               codepre  pForm 2 page p  precode    lthoutputScript libraryjavax.faces namejsf.jsgt     lthform idmyFormgt         ... whole bunch of fields here ...          ... real button for user to submit ...         lthcommandButton valueSubmit myForm                          actionsomeViewScopedBean.save gt         ... hidden button for autosave by javascript ...         lthcommandLink idhiddenSaveDraft styledisplay none                        actionsomeViewScopedBean.saveDraft gt               ltfajax executeform gt        lthcommandLinkgt          ltscriptgt            function saveDraft                  document.getElementByIdqFormhiddenSaveDraft.onclick                 window.setTimeoutsaveDraft,15000                        saveDraft        ltscriptgt      lthformgt codepre

Negative 201 pBefore I post this question, I found somehow similar question posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions203984howdoiremoverepeatedelementsfromarraylistherea.

How can I do that p

Negative 201 pSay a process is forked from another process. In other words, we replicate a process through the fork function call. Now since forking is a copyonwrite mechanism, what happens is that whenever the forked process or the original process write to a page, they get a new physical page to write. So what Ive understood, things go like this when both forked and original processes are executing.p  p when forking, all pages of original and forked process are given read only access, so that the kernel get to know which page is written. When that happens, the kernel maps a new physical page to the writing process, writes the previous content to it, and then gives the write access to that page. Now what I am not clear about is if both fork and original process write to the same page, will one of them will still hold the original physical page prior to forking that is or both will get new physical pages. Secondly, is my assumption correct that all pages in forked and original process are given read only access at time of forkingp  p Now since each page fault will trigger an interrupt, that means each write to original or forked process will slow down execution. Say if we know about the application, and we know that alot of contiguous memory pages will be written, wouldnt it be better to give write permission to multiple pages  a group of pages lets say  when one of the page in the group is written to. That would reduce the number of interrupts due to page fault handling. Isnt it Sure, we may sometimes make a copy unnecessarily in this case, but I think an interrupt has much more overhead than writing 512 variables of type emlongem 4096 bytes of a page. Is my understanding correct or am I missing somethingp

Negative 201 pemstrongIntroductionemstrongp  pI am working on an MVC web app that is using XMPP for two purposes 1 Communicating real time data from the server to the client  XMPPMessaging 2 User group chat  XMPPChatp  pI am using Strophe.js on the client side and MatriX C library on the server side. XMPPChat is being set up by prebinding on the server side and passing the connection info to the client, which attaches with strophe.  XMPPMessaging is not prebinding, just logging in on the client side. Every window that the user opens connects a new XMPPMessaging instance to receive data from the server. Only the chat windows connect XMPPChat and XMPPMessaging. Also, both are connecting to the Punjab connection manager over BOSH, which is forwarding the messages to an Openfire server.p  pemstrongIssueemstrongp  pCurrently, I have an issue that only manifests itself in Internet Explorer I am testing with IE8 and IE9 and both exibit this issue. When I have XMPPMessaging and XMPPChat connected, chat messages are being sent after a very large delay 10 sec  2 minutes. Ive seen this cause disconnection issues for XMPPChat as well. The receive functionality works great if any other browser posts to the chatroom, IE gets it immediately just like everyone else. When XMPPMessaging is turned off, the chat send runs great with no delays or disconnections.  Ive stepped through the code with breakpoints and the send functionality is firing immediately. Ive also observed the Punjab logs, and it appears that Punjab isnt getting the message till after the delay and is passing them along fine also evidenced by the other browsers working fine.p  pIm mostly wondering if anyone else has seen issues like this one with concurrent BOSH connections in IE comehow interfering.p  pemstrongUpdateemstrongp  pThe chat feature in IE started working today completely inexplicably I havent changed the code or any configuration of it at all. I double checked that the messaging connection and chat connection were both running, and they both were connected. In attempts to diagnose the fix, I restarted Apache and the bug came back, again only in IE we saw the chat slow down significantly and randomly disconnect.p  pemstrongUpdate 2  SEEN IN OTHER BROWSERSemstrongp  pToday I was able to recreate the issue in other browsers Chrome, Firefox by opening multiple chat instances in other tabs. So it seems that IE only suffered worse from the issue  only needing one tab open. This is pointing me towards a browser concurrent connection limit issue, but that doesnt make sense to be either considering that I shouldnt be anywhere near the limit with 2 connections.p  pemstrongUpdate 3  CAUSE DETERMINED IN OTHER BROWSERSemstrongp  pI performed a test in Firefox to confirm my suspicions that we are dealing with a concurrent connection issue. I opened one chat tab and the messages posted instantaneously. I opened a second one and, as expected, they delayed. I then opened strongaboutconfigstrong and changed emnetwork.http.maxpersistentconnectionsperserverem from 6 to 7. After doing this I repeated the test. I was able to post messages instantaneously in embothem the first and second chat tabs, but when I opened a third they all began experiencing the delay. Im going to try and test in IE to see if this is the same problem by modifying the FEATUREMAXCONNECTIONSPERSERVER registry settings and seeing if the problem goes away.p  pemstrongUpdate 4  IE ISSUE STILL NOT RESOLVEDemstrongp  pI performed the same test in IE, changing the registry as shown here, adding iexplorer.exe DWORD settings to the FEATUREMAXCONNECTIONSPERSERVER and FEATUREMAXCONNECTIONSPER10SERVER registries set to 0xA, but no changes in behavior are apparent. I tried the same thing with the x64 settings under Wow6432Node and still observed no changes.

Negative 201 pOur company has been quite successful in managing its website including all of the business logic and stuff. However, there are also a lot of static content pages which today get served using a templating system which stores the content in serialized PHP objects on the file system.p  pWe are now considering using a real CMS, however we have some requirements which sort out more or less all the usual suspects. The most important requirement is our hosting environmentp  pWe have two completely separate hosting locations with a share nothing approach for failover. Both locations have separate MySQL instances which are slaves  of our master database which is located onsite at our HQ. Both locations have a certain number of web servers each storing the complete website again, for failover.p  pFrom this architecture, two possible approaches come out naturally  A databasedriven CMS which gets managed at our HQ and gets replicated over to our hosting locations and images and stuff which gets replicated using our file sync process  A file driven CMS in which not only the attachments, but also the content files get synced using our file syncp  pThe database driven approach seems more flexible to me, however we couldnt find a CMS which works in a administer locally on a readwrite database and serve content using only a readonly slave. The usual suspect for example Typo3 needs a database to write to for its logging and session management, is therefore not an option. Other CMS seem to share this problem.  p  pSo, long story short, is there a PHPMySQLCMS out there which can handle this Any suggestionsp  pExtra points if the CMS can easily integrated with our Zend Framework applications or vice versa.p

ApiDemossrccomexampleandroidapisappLoaderThrottle.javap  pI tried hard to understand this example but I still have some points I dont understand.p  pI didnt found android.R.layout.simplelistitem1 and android.R.id.text1 on line 406 p  precode             Create an empty adapter we will use to display the loaded data.         mAdapter  new SimpleCursorAdaptergetActivity,                 android.R.layout.simplelistitem1, null,                 new String[]  MainTable.COLUMNNAMEDATA ,                 new int[]  android.R.id.text1 , 0         setListAdaptermAdapter codepre  pI also didnt find android.R.id.content on line 377p  precode         Create the list fragment and add it as our sole content.     if fm.findFragmentByIdandroid.R.id.content  null          ThrottledLoaderListFragment list  new ThrottledLoaderListFragment         fm.beginTransaction.addandroid.R.id.content, list.commit      codepre  pThere is no simplelistitem1.xml in ApiDemos layout directory.

Given a generic collection, if I dop  precodepublic class HashTableltV extends ComparableltVgtgt implements HashTableInterfaceltVgt      private V[] array      public HashTable          this.array  V[] new Object[10]       codepre  pthe code breaks, throwing an exception java.lang.ClassCastException em[Ljava.lang.Object cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Comparableemp  pHowever, if I change codethis.array  V[] new Object[10]code to codethis.array  V[] new Comparable[10]code then it works.p  pThe way I understand it is that upon compilation the resulting bytecode will not have any generic references as they are replaced by Javas type erasure.p  pcodethis.array  V[] new Object[10]code breaks because the line will implicitly be replaced by codethis.array  Comparable[] new Object[10]code which will then result in a cast exception as Object does not extend Comparable. It is resolved by changing it to an array of Comparables.p  pIs this correct Thanksp
Negative 201 pLet me explain, I have a website that I need to display a category structure that displays one category depth at a time, then when the final depth is reached, it will display the entries in that category.p  pThe only way I have managed to do this is with using gwcodecategories. Using this I am outputting the depth into the url structure then using this segment to hard code what depth to display in my main page. Otherwise gwcodecategories will display every depth, you cant actually dynamically grab the current depth of categories depending on the current category.p  pThis works great and I can cycle through all depths, however when I reach the final depth I thought it would be easy to output the entries in that category by adding a if noresults to my gwcode code.

To try and speed the process of finding the problem I have checked few things and think I have found the cause of the problem. Basically I am trying to redirect to the view that is currently active which I think is part of the reason why it is not redirecting. I have read that it might have something to do with caching of the page but I am not sure how to solve that issue. p  pAlso when using firebug I can see the redirect is sending a GET request but after that nothing is happening. Do I have to do something with the GET request or should Cake handle that for me. Also I have checked the URL of the GET and it is correct. p  pIt is located within the controller with the correct name as I can view the original tool page. p  pAlso the updatestickypostitionindb method does not have a view hence why the auto render is set to false, its intended purpose is to update a row in the database from an ajax call. p

Negative 201 pLets say I wanna make a type synonym for all lists with Ints.p  pI could dop  precodetype NumberList  [Int] codepre  pBut what if I want to call all lists that contains numbers NumberList How would I put a constraint and say that all [a] as long as Num a should be called the samep  pEdit After seeing the answers I rethought. It seemed like I was going against one of the basic ideas behind Haskell and the reward was relatively small just a formal matter. I decided on this If a type has the need for two instances identical to each other that only differ in Int or Float, then the difference between them is too small to warrant the workaround needed to accomplish the use of both Int and Float but calling them the same thing, which is why I must restrict the use to one of them. IF however there is an important reason to why I should have both, then I can probably reflect this important reason in the name of the instance and thereby avoid the problem by doingp  precodedata Thing  ThingAString, String Float  ThingBString,String,Int codepre  pand thereby stick to Haskells typing system and still accept both of them as data type Thing. What I wanted to do at first wasp  precodedata Thing  ThingString, String, Float  ThingString, String, Int codepre  pThank you allp

Negative 201 pstrongIMPORTANTstrongp  pAfter following the advice in the answers below, the client was able to login without any problems but did not attempt to actually navigate the secured pages. When he attempted to do so later, he was returned to login as before with the Please log in error. After much head scratching, something incredibly simple came to mind  the client was accessing the site with a hrefhttpwww.example.comadmin relnofollowhttpwww.example.comadmina and everything in the login script was redirecting to a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma, so the session cookie that it was looking for was set for another domain. This also explains why he had problems logging in the first time but not subsequent times  the script redirected him to the login form without the www.p  pA quick fix was to write a .htaccess file to remove the www, problem solved. Of course this could also be handled within the login script, which I will improve for future use.p  pstrongORIGINAL POSTstrongp  pI develop PHP and MySQL based sites with a home brew CMS and login system. My CMS is unique to every client and it has been quite the crowd pleaser  unfortunately the same is not true of my login system. The following is a long post but I need to cover the details to try and find a solution. Bear with me..p  pThe system is fairly straight forward, if not a bit hefty. Each user has a salted hash stored in a MySQL table, alongside the SALT. When the user logs in, their SALT is retrieved and the submitted password becomes a salted hash.p  pIf the submitted salted hash matches the one stored in the table, the user is authenticated. Details such as their name, last IP address, and account level 3 levels on most sites are stored in an array assigned to a session variable. They are then redirected to the landing page of the restricted site to which they logged in Members Only or AdminCMS.p  pSecured pages include a smaller auth.php file that checks to see if the session variable containing their details is present. If not, they are redirected to that sites login form with an error message that reads Please login. If it is present, they are allowed to continue and the details stored in the array are assigned to variables.p  pThe problem that many users has reported is that they often need to login several times to keep from being bounced back to the login form with the Please login error message, or they navigate to another page in the secure site and randomly get bounced back to login with the same error. So, the session variable seems to either not be getting set or it is being cleared for some reason during normal use of the site. p  pThe first problem has NEVER happened to me  over a multitude of devices and networks  and I have witnessed it at a clients office using their laptop. I had them connect to my mobile hotspot and there was no change. However, they were able to log in without any problems using my laptop and my hotspot connection. Unfortunately, I was not able to connect to their network using my laptop, so that variable could not be ruled out.p  pstrongemNOTE  emstrong I forgot to mention initially that the system works normally for problem clients after they have logged in two or three times with the correct credentials. Subsequent login attempts while their browser remains open tend to execute without problems thereafter. Also, the login page destroys the session.p  pHere is the code for each stage, starting with the login scriptp  pstronglogin.phpstrongp  precodeltphp putenvTZUSEastern  if arraykeyexistssite, POST      authenticate  new loginUserPOST[username], POST[password], POST[site], SERVER[REMOTEADDR]  Authenticate and login class loginUser      private memDB, username, password, site, ipaddress       Clean input variables     private function cleanstr          str  trimstr         ifgetmagicquotesgpc              str  stripslashesstr                  return str          Construct variables     function constructusername, password, site, ipaddress      sessionstart         thisgtmemDB  new PDOmysqlhostlocalhostdbnameexampleDB, exampleUser, examplePassword         thisgtusername  thisgtcleanusername         thisgtpassword  thisgtcleanpassword         thisgtsite  site         thisgtipaddress  ipaddress     thisgtauthUser          Validate username     private function validateUsernameusername           checkUsername  thisgtmemDBgtprepareSELECT COUNT FROM accounts WHERE username           checkUsernamegtexecutearrayusername         return checkUsernamegtfetchColumn          Obtain and set account details     private function accountDetails           fetchAccountDetails  thisgtmemDBgtprepareSELECT id, namef, namel, ipAddr, lastLogin, accountLevel, isActive          FROM accounts WHERE username           fetchAccountDetailsgtexecutearraythisgtusername         accountDetails  fetchAccountDetailsgtfetch         thisgtupdateLogin         return accountDetails          Update last login details     private function updateLogin           updateLogin  thisgtmemDBgtprepareUPDATE accounts SET ipAddr  , lastLogin  DATEADDNOW, INTERVAL 1 HOUR WHERE username           updateLogingtexecutearraythisgtipaddress, thisgtusername          public function authUser           loginErr  array Array for holding login error message         loginErrFlag  false Boolean for error         Validate submitted POST elements         if thisgtusername              loginErr[]  Username missing             loginErrFlag  true                  if thisgtpassword              loginErr[]  Password missing             loginErrFlag  true                  if thisgtusername ampamp thisgtvalidateUsernamethisgtusername  0              loginErr[]  Username invalid             loginErrFlag  true                  if loginErrFlag              Fetch the password and SALT to compare to entered password             validatePW  thisgtmemDBgtprepareSELECT password, salt FROM accounts WHERE username   LIMIT 1             validatePWgtexecutearraythisgtusername             passwordResult  validatePWgtfetch             dbPW  passwordResult[password]             dbSalt  passwordResult[salt]             Compare entered password to SALT  hash             hashPW  hashsha512, dbSalt . thisgtpassword             if hashPW  dbPW                  Logged in                 SESSION[CVFDUSERDETAILS]  thisgtaccountDetails                 Redirect to secure landing page for login origin Members or Admin                 Adding SID is a recent attempt to handle login problems                 headerLocation httpexample.comthisgtsitethisgtsitemain.php .

Negative 201 pI have an application that displays lots of images, and images can be of varying size up to full screen dimensions of device.

I am wondering if there is any other way to reduce the memory footprint of the loaded Bitmap while keeping the dimensions the same as the original p  p Update p  pAfter discussions here and lots of other searchingreading it does not appear that there is a straight forward way do this. I could use ARGB4444 which stores each pixel as 2 bytes, rather than 4 bytes per pixel. The problem there is that ARGB4444 is deprecated, and I try not to use deprecated parts of the API for obvious reasons. Android recommends use of ARGB8888 which is the default, since I need alpha I have to use that. Since there are many applications that do not need such a complex color space it would be nice to see ARGB4444 or something similar become part of the supported API.p

Negative 201 pI am trying to implement a test suite using WebDriver and TFS.p  pThe test suite consists of 100 tests that need to be launched every night in different browsers Chrome, FF and IE9. This means that the same 100 tests will run first in IE, then  in FF, and then in Chrome.p  pThese tests will be launched with a TFS build, triggered by time.p  pNormally, I would define the browser driver in code[TestInitialize]code, but if I define one of the browsers there, I can only launch 100 tests with that browser.p  pI am thinking of using three different builds of the same project. The three builds would be associated with the same code.

And I have been trying to introduce that variable using the SetupScript of testSettings.Local, also without success.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 201 pI am seeing some odd behavior out of the codestrncatcode function in the codestring.hcode standard library, and would like some help understanding what is going on.p  hr  pThe crux of my issue is in a function I created called codereadLinecode with the purpose of returning the lines of a file as codechar code strings without a trailing newline terminator. That function looks like thisp  precodechar  readLineFILE  fp      char  chunk  NULL     char  line  NULL     int count  0       iterate through chunks of a line until we reach the end or an error     while fgetschunk  mallocsizeofchar  BUFFERSIZE, BUFFERSIZE, fp  NULL            realloc on a null pointer works like malloc           line  reallocline, count  BUFFERSIZE  sizeofchar              printfchunks contents sn, chunk           does chunk contain the end of a line         ifstrchrchunk, n  NULL                  concatenate string parts and continue loop             strncatline, chunk, strlenchunk  1                     freechunk           else               we want to return a 0 terminated string without the n              expected position of n in chunk is length of chunk1             chunk[strlenchunk  1]  0               concatenate string parts             strncatline, chunk, strlenchunk  1             printfreadLine line    sn, line             freechunk              break                                   return line  codepre  pI call it in main in a loop that looks like thisp  precodeFILE  fp  NULL  if fp  fopenFILEPATH, r  NULL      char  line  NULL      while line  readLinefp  NULL          printfmain line        snn, line         freeline           fclosefp  codepre  hr  pNow the odd behavior comes in my definition of codedefine BUFFERSIZE 1000code.

Negative 201 pI have a grid and an action button that opens a form.  THere is a date field in the grid and on the form that is not editable  however when I do updateRecord, the data field value is set to null in the grid.  I noticed 2 things  in the extall  when the date is parced  it is not recongnized as a date, but string, so when it is parced, it is expected to be in ms  but it is actually in yyyymmdd format.  So the parcing returns null  and thats what is sent to the grid.

Negative 201 pI have a custom file format similar to a zip file that packs small files small images, mp3 files into 1 physical file. My android app downloads this file, and it displays one image from it. The user can touch the image and itll start to play one of the small mp3 files inside the packed file. He can also swipe left or right, and the app displays the previous or next image.p  pIn order to make things smoother I am holding 3 cards in the memory the one currently displayed, and the prevous and the next one. This way when its swiped, I can immediatelly show the next image. In order to do this, I am preloading the images and the mp3 into the MediaPlayer. The problem is that because of this it is multi threaded, as the preloading is done in the background. I have a bug when I start to play the mp3, and during its playing I swipe, the image I preaload is cut in the middle. After lots of debugging, I found the reason while I load the image, the MediaPlayer is moving the file pointer in the file descriptor, and that causes the next read to read from the middle of the mp3 instead of the image.p  pHeres the codep  precodeInputStream imageStream  myPackedFile.getBaseStreamcat.jpg  this returns an InputStream representing cat.jpg from my packed file which is based on a RandomAccessFile Drawable image  Drawable.createFromStreamimageStream, imagePath  FileDescriptor fd  myPackedFile.getFD long pos  myPackedFile.getPoscat.mp3 long len  myPackedFile.getLengthcat.mp3 player.setDataSourcefd, pos, len player.prepare codepre

Negative 201 pIve looked around the docs on the pytest website, but havent found a clear example of working with test resources, such as reading in fixed files during unit tests. Something similar to what a hrefhttpjlorenzen.blogspot.com200706properwaytoaccessfileresourcesin.html relnofollowhttpjlorenzen.blogspot.com200706properwaytoaccessfileresourcesin.htmla describes for Java. p  pFor example, if I have a yaml file checked in to source control, what is the right way to write a test which loads from that file I think this boils down to understanding the right way to access a resource file on the python equivalent of the classpath PYTHONPATH.p  pThis seems like it should be simple. Is there an easy solutionp
Negative 201 pI am trying to understand the viewport meta tag for ios devices.  I created a test page, where I inserted an image that is 862px wide. so i have the viewport meta tag asp  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth,  initialscale1.0, minimumscale .5, maximumscale 5.0gt codepre  pYet on the ipad 3, with a resolution width of 1536 pixels, and having the viewport set to the same amount of visible area of the ipad 3, the 862px image is blown up, and is a little larger in width than the visible area. so i have to scroll horizontally to see the rest of the image.p  pThis makes me think that devicewidth is returning 768 pixels, and that accounts for the little bit extra of horizontal scroll for the 862 pixel image. Why is it doing this Is there some kind of pixel density I have to account forp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve tried setting the width to a numerical width, the same exact width of the image in this case 862. So the webpage is 862X206, the same as the image, yet it is doing the same exact thing as setting the width to devicewidth.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pI created a very simple page, and for some reason a blank page with a viewport of 862 pixels causes horizontal and vertical scrolling on my ipad 3, the codep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta nameviewport contentwidth862, initialscale1.0gt ltheadgt  ltbody stylewidth100 padding0 margin0gt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThis scrolling is causing the viewport not to fit inside the viewable area or screen size. I dont understand. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  Note  I forgot to add a reset of the padding and margin to 0, it was adding 8 px of margin.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strongp  pOk, originally, I thought that the devicewidth would return the resolution width of 1536 pixels of the ipad 3.  Apparently, it returns the screen size of 768 pixels. p  pAny viewport width greater than 768, gives me scrolling on the ipad 3. why what if you had a page that was 1024 pixels, and you want to fit that into the visible area of the ipad 3. you set the width to 1024, the initialscale to 1, shouldnt that make the 1024px viewport fit into the viewable areap  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pOk, so, if you want to have each device figure out how to scale your page, all you do is leave out the initialscale.p  pSo if I set just the width, using either devicewidth or a numerical value, and leave out the initialscale, it automatically calculates the zoom for you. and it just works. p  pmy confusion lied in what the width meant, width means the width before the scale is applied, so if i sayp  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth,  initialscale1.0, minimumscale .5, maximumscale 5.0gt codepre  pthe width of the viewport before the scale is, 768, and if the webpage body is say 862px, and after the scale factor of 1.0 is applied, the content is multiplied by 1.0, 8621.0, so the width of the viewport strongis nowstrong the width of the content scaled at that scale factor, 862px. i hope i understand this right. thats where my confusion was, was what width meant.p

Negative 201 pIm trying to build a wizard and Im new to ajax and jquery. Im just a htmlcss gal. Im trying it this way since flash wont work on any apple device.  Anyway Ive downloaded a hrefhttptechlaboratory.netsmartwizard relnofollowhttptechlaboratory.netsmartwizarda  And will be working off of this to build my  wizard.  p  pEssentially what Im building is a wizard that in each step will help you build your car seat.  The problem arises that there are multiple types of colors to choose from and then multiple insert colors on top of that.  So you could pick a black seat for example, but then if you decided to purchase a seat with an insert, you can pick a variety of colors like yellow or blue or something.  There are so many seat colors  insert colors I didnt want to load that large of a selection of images into a database to pull from. p  pWhat I was considering doing was saving two separate png image files, one for the seat and another for the inserts.  If the customer chooses the seat with an insert they each are on their own zindex and then I use a css overlay to color each zindex.  The issue is can i just color the image itself without bleeding off of the image to the background or lower indexed image  Maybe theres a better way with ajax someone knows of to select and change the color of each itemp

Negative 201 pBeing the method codeforkcode within codecomputecode how come that does not get called another degree of parallelism each time the method codecomputecode occurs Is there a boolean flag perhaps strongEDITstrongp  poverriding the method codecomputecode of the class RecursiveTask pseudocodep  precodeif array.lengthlt100 do it else divide array by 2 fork int righta  rightArray.compute int lefta IntegerleftArray.join return righta lefta codepre  pSo basically this is the codecomputecode method which gets called recursively and when codeforkcode happens it makes it possible to use parallelism and process that task with another core. However being recursive codeforkcode should be called all the times the method gets recursively called. So in the reality it does not happen there would be no sense. Is it due to a boolean flag that says fork has already been activatedp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 201 pI am a beginner in Javascript, I use a template which uses jquery to resize the height of a column.

Negative 201 pOk, I am completely pulling my hair out on this one.p  pBack in July I created a provisioning profile so I could test on my iPad.p  pThen at the end of August I tried submitting my first App to the iTunes Store. The process was a complete nightmare, and I struggled. A lot. In the end I found a tutorial with relatively recent information in it, and only by following it step by step could I actually get anywhere with this. Unfortunately the result of this was that I created a new provisioning profile.p  pNow when I try to test on my iPad I get the following error in Xcodep  precodeCertificate identity iPhone Developer MyName appears more than once in the keychain. The codesign tool requires there only be one. codepre  pI check the keychain, and sure enough there are the two provisioning profiles for development, one from July and the one I used to submit to the iTunes Store in August.p  pNow what I want to do is get rid of the old one, and then connect my iPad up to the new one. I can get rid of the old one fine, but I cannot connect my iPad to the new one, it insists on using the old profile, even to the point of reattaching it to the keychain after Ive deleted it.p  pCan anyone tell mep  pstrongHow to connect my iPad to the new provisioning profilestrongp  pAnd while we are at it, can anyone shed any light on why this entire process is so convoluted and difficult Considering that so much of Apples interface is so well designed and fluid, this process of registering certificates and applying them to different devices and Apps seems so backwards. I initially suspected this was just me, but googling for these error messages reveals that there are many who are struggling at various points along this process.p

Negative 201 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comthquinnDraggableGridView relnofollowthquinns DraggableGridViewa and load 60 images into it. This all works fine. I had all the images needed in my assets, but want to create them at runtime since first of only the Text on the images change which seems redundant and I can reduce the appsize and the second reason is that I need to sometimes change the icons over the Air where adding wouldnt be the problem but deleting from assets isnt possible and would use unnecessary space.

The Base Images are 200x200 px which I think should also be scaled to the need size depending on screensize and density.br First of, this method doesnt seem efficient because I create a Bitmap canvas then make a LayerdDrawable which I make into a Bitmap for caching again.

Negative 201 pI have a RESTful controller that is responsible for building many different models. This means that any given view would requires a handful of variables to be set before it can be rendered correctly. If I set those variables in the controller, then the code would have to be duplicated across different actions that might render that view. For example, rendering Page 1 requires 5 variables. If show, create, and update all render that view, then the code to set those 5 variables is duplicated across those controller actions. The alternative is to just put all of that code inside the view. But that can get really uglyp  precodelt variable1  Model1.wheresome conditions gt lt variable2  Model2.wheresome other conditions gt lt variable3  Model3.wheresome third conditions gt codepre  pIm hesitant about this solution because of how much code goes into the views. Ive always followed the principle that the code in views shouldnt touch the database. Another method Im entertaining is creating private methods that focus on setting variables and rendering a view. This method could be called by all the actions that require rendering. p

Negative 201 pHello Im having a bit of trouble getting my values to read properly from a .csv file.

So the vector will have an object in from the first line after the words, and then itll have the third line but itll miss out the second line.

Negative 201 pUsing the SNMP4J library I am able to successfully retrieve information from multiple agents using SNMP over UDP.

Negative 201 pAre there any free Java libraries available for training decision trees that allow for the setting of a separate validation set for reduced error pruningp  pFor Weka what Im currently using, it only allows for nfold cross validation using a random subset of the data.  However, as I am working with time series data it would be beneficial to use the first half of my data as the training data, and use the second half future data for validationpruning.p  pWith nfold validation, overfitting is a serious problem and is leading to barely above 50 accuracy.p
Negative 201 pAs I decided to use sessions instead of cookies, is it good to set codesession.useonlycookies0code in the php configuration, also if it advices to keep it onp  pThis option forces PHP to fetch and use a cookie for storing and maintaining the session id. We encourage this operation as its very helpful in combating session hijacking when not specifying and managing your own session id. It is not the end all be all of session hijacking defense, but its a good start.p  pAnd also is it good to store user session informations in a database and to check every time if it matches, for example, with codeSESSION[password]code and codeSESSION[id]code  Can anyone advice me the best practice to create a sessionbased authentication,pleasep

Negative 201 pIm working on a form to create new users for a codeRuby on Railscode project. Id like to start by mentioning that the form itself works just fine when filled out correctly and creates users exactly the right way. However, not all of the codeActive Record Validationcode appears to be working, in particular the codevalidates institutionpid, presence truecode bit. The rest of the form works the way it should. If an element is blank or filled out in correctly an error message pops up on the screen so the user can fix it and the form wont submit. But if the form is submitted without an institution being chosen, instead of that error showing up it submits anyways and then I get this error p  precodeActiveFedoraObjectNotFoundError in UsersControllercreate codepre  pThis is happening, obviously, because its trying to use the institution from the form that hasnt been filled out.

Negative 201 pI keep getting a null pointer error when i dequeue in my main method. I know the Enqueuepush method works fine, but it will only not give me an error when i pop if i do it from the opposite one. For example, if i push 3 values in from the begin, i can only pop 1 from the back. If i try to pop from front it gives me an error. And vice versai hope i made it clear.

The remaining code uses the .load function for the other operations and works like a charm.p  pCan you give me a hand at understanding why this happensp  hr  pHeres the portion of the code used for the load and appending of new contentp  precode.ajax   url link,   type GET,   success functionhtml      ifhtml        var result  ltdiv gt.appendhtml.findcentercontentdata.html       centercontentdata.appendresult       centercontentdataloading.hide          codepre  pEDIT I also tried to load the content using .post and .get but got the same result.p  precode.postlink, functiondata    data.findcentercontentdata.appendTocentercontentdata  codepre

Negative 201 pIve been wanting to experiment with platforming physics using freeglut, but before I would allow myself to start, I had an old problem to take care of.p  pYou see, I want to write a reshape handler that not only maintains the scale and eliminates any distortion of the view, but also allows all of the onscreen shapes to maintain their size even while the window is too small to contain them i.e. let them be clipped.p  pIve almost got all three parts solved, but when I scale my window, the circle I have drawn onto it scales strongjust slightlystrong.

Its still the same shape throughout, but a visual inspection tells me that the shape is not the same size when the window is 150x300 as it is when the window is 600x800, regardless of which glOrtho is being executed.p

Negative 201 pIm trying to create a filter that both dulls the brightness down to 30 and also greyscales the image to 90.

Where I am a bit confused is in the development of the server.p  pMy intended approach is to use long polling to retrieve messages from the server and a separate connection to send messages to the server using GETPOST obviously, there is no need for this to be long polled. My initial intention was to use Apache amp PHPMySQL for the server, but after a bit of reading, I learnt Apache wont be able to survive when there are lots of concurrent connections. I also learnt Node.js can survive where Apache failed by its capabilities to handle a lot of concurrent connections.

Negative 201 pI am trying to enhance a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles6338SnapFormExtenderamagnetforyourMDIchildforms relnofollowthis CodeProject projecta called SnapFormExtender. This project extends MDIParent forms and snaps its child forms to each other and its containers edges. p  pThe problem I am having with it is that it tries to snap child forms too often while moving forms within the MDI container causing the form to jitter when a user moves it near another form or the container edges.p  pTo fix this I want to draw an outline of the forms possible new location instead of redrawing the form, and when the user is done movingresizing the form I will then actually change the forms position. p  pMy current issue is that it seems that I cannot actually draw a line on the MDIParent form with codeGraphics.DrawLinecode. Below is the method I use to try to draw the lines on the MDIParent. To be as succinct as possible I have posted the entire code to a hrefhttppastebin.comuBREMh5g relnofollowhttppastebin.comuBREMh5ga for further review p  pIn the code below codeparentFormcode is set in SnapFormExtender when it is added to a form. It is the MDIParent that this class works with to snap its child forms. codeForm formcode is the child form, and codePoint possibleLocationcode is the new location of the form snapped location if the user were to stop moving the form now. p  precodeprivate void DrawPossiblePositionForm form, Point possibleLocation      float[] dashValues   2, 2      Console.Out.WriteLineDrawing possible position     using Pen blackPen  new PenColor.Yellow, 5              blackPen.DashPattern  dashValues         Console.Out.WriteLineGot a black dashed pen         using Graphics parentGfx  parentForm.CreateGraphics                      int xLoc  possibleLocation.X             int yLoc  possibleLocation.Y             Console.Out.WriteLineGot gfx object, drawing lines             parentGfx.DrawLineblackPen, new PointxLoc, yLoc, new PointxLocform.Width, yLoc             parentGfx.DrawLineblackPen, new PointxLocform.Width, yLoc, new PointxLocform.Width, yLocform.Height             parentGfx.DrawLineblackPen, new PointxLoc  form.Width, yLoc  form.Height, new PointxLoc, yLoc  form.Height              parentGfx.DrawLineblackPen, new PointxLoc, yLoc  form.Height, new PointxLoc, yLoc                codepre  pThis code executes with no error and displays all of the codeConsole.Out.WriteLinescode. It is called whenever a child form is being moved within the MDIParent. p  pWhat I can figure, since all of the print statements are called is that either the MDIParent is ignoring my codeDrawLinescode or it is repainting itself so often as a result of a form being moved that all of my codeDrawLinescode are just erased once the child form moves a single pixel. But I dont think this is the case because I never see even a flash of the lines on the screen. p  pIs there a special timemethod by which I need to draw these linesp  pOr.p  pShould I override the MDIParents codeOnPaintcode method to optionally draw lines of the specified locationdimension if a flag is set, and set the flag and dimensions from the SnapFormExtender classp

Negative 201 pIm writing an application that has both Python and C libraries.

Negative 201 pI am making a game in Cocos2D Version 3.1 using spriteBuilder. I am creating my animation by add the list of frames into an array and storing it in the cache. When I need to run the animation, I get it from the cache and play it on the screen. This works great for my running animation. I have another animation in which my character is sliding. When I play my sliding animation after my running animation, my character appears to be sliding in midair, not intersecting the ground. The reason for this is probably because the frames are loaded immeadately after the running animation, so they are loaded in the same place as the running animation. Since the frames of the sliding animation are smaller than the running animation, it makes it seem like the player is floating. p  pI would like to know if there is any way I can make the frames load a bit lower, so that they are touching the ground. Is the only way to do this to push the position of the hero down when the slide animation is loaded, and then back up when I want to load the run animationp  pThanks p

Negative 201 pMy attempts at trying to stick with the MVVM design pattern has left me spinning in my tracks. I have a view that is a pick list of site locations. I have a viewmodel that the view gets its data context from and Ive bound some items to it with buttons and such yay. p  pNow Im trying to switch the current view from a button click from within the view. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comN3eLm.jpg altMy pagep  pBy clicking on the start maintenance button I would like to switch the view to another view with a different viewmodel. p  pSo I know MVVM is just a design pattern and there seems to be a bajillion different ways of implementing navigation with MVVM. But the majority of these solutions Ive seen point to having a main navigation pane and that is not what i am intending to do. p  pI plan on now trying to use a viewmodellocator with MVVM light messenger pattern to try and get my views to change. But after spending the past 3 days trying to shoehorn this thing to work, Im growing desperate. Are there any other suggestions on how to implement this I do like Sheridans answer to a similar posta hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19654295wpfmvvmnavigateviewsWPF MVVM navigate viewsa because it avoids using a toolkitframework. But I think the answer was perhaps too vague for me and I couldnt implement it because I didnt understand how to change the views Sheridans custom relay message was hard to follow as a novice.p  pHelp please you Internet Denizens  If you could point me to any examples that would appreciated as wellp

I have the RS232 plugged into COM1, and then I have pins 2 3 and 5 on the other end of the RS232 connected to arduino pins TX, RX, and GND, respectively.p  pI found a serial comm class for c at the following linkp  pa hrefhttpplayground.arduino.ccInterfacingCPPWindows relnofollowhttpplayground.arduino.ccInterfacingCPPWindowsap  pI have added the .h and .cpp files from the above example as Serial.h and Serial.cpp i think the example uses SerialClass.h and SerialClass.cpp, I just changes the names.  p  hr  pOn my arduino, I have the following code runningp  precode ARDUINO char incomingByte  0  void setup          Serial.begin9600   void loop            send data only when you receive data         if Serial.available gt 0                   read the incoming byte                 incomingByte  Serial.read                   say what you got                 Serial.printI received                  Serial.printlnincomingByte, HEX           codepre  hr  pAnd my c program is the followingp  precode C include ltiostreamgt include ltWindows.hgt include Serial.h  using namespace std  int mainvoid      Serial portCOM1      char msg  Hello Arduino     int msgLen  strlenmsg     bool writeSuccess  port.WriteDatamsg, msgLen      cout ltlt nn     systemPAUSE  codepre  hr  pWhen I use the Arduinos serial port viewer to see what is bring printed, Im getting very strange values that dont match what Im sending as far as I can tell.p  pWhen I send Hello Arduino, the arduino prints the followingp  precodeI received FFFFFFAB I received 3A I received 3A I received A I received FFFFFFFA I received FFFFFFEB I received 6D I received 37 I received 15 I received 2D I received 23 I received 21 I received FFFFFFBD I received 0 codepre  pThis does not appear to be the correct hex for Hello Arduino, but I have no idea why its not correct.  Does anyone have any clue what Im doing wrongp

Negative 201 pAs stated a hrefhttpcommunity.skype.comt5LinuxHavingtroublesigninginRetirementofolderversionsofSkypetdp3439685 relnofollowherea on the Skype website, there is a mandatory update for all skype clients to version 4.3, because the old clients are not able to connect anymore. I updated my client on my GNULinux Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and started testing the dbus API I was using to connect to the skype client.  From my tests it seems that some of the dbus API stopped working, but Id like someone else to confirm my statement. myabe Im doing something wrongp  pWhat I normally do, to use the skype client as an engine is to use the DBUS commandp  pstrongALTER CALL  SETOUTPUT PORT[sometcpport]strongp  pstrongALTER CALL  SETINPUT PORT[anothertcpport]strongp  pThe above command are sent via dbus to skype once the call is up and running The effect should be that skype redirect the raw audio data inout to the configured tcp ports. That way my software can interact with the skype audio flows.p  pWith emversion 4.3em of the skype client the strongcommands does not return an errorstrong, but all I get on the out channel is white noisep  pI also tried the command varian strongFILE[somefile].wavstrong but Im still getting a non empty  wav file apparently containing only white noise at a very low volume. I played the file with play mplayer and audacityp  pDoes anyone succeeded in using the dbus API to get the skype audio data with the new client 4.3 Do you have any idea of alternative solution, in the event the above dbus command are not working anymore as expectedp

Negative 201 pIve developed a compiling bank system of different accounts. My base class is Account, and derived classes are Checking, Savings, MoneyMarket. The latter three inherit private member variable balance from Account. All strongfourstrong accounts need to maintain and modify their own balance. p  pHowever, Im confused about the relation between Accounts balance and derived classs balance. p  pAs you can see in Checkings getBalance, it is forced to use Accounts getBalance due to the private variable, and the code only works when it displays Accountbalance.

Notice that the part in the above thats black but supposed to be red stays black, but the part thats red is now codeCOLORACTIVECAPTIONcode.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comMkwYVQQ.png altincorrect 2p  pImages are from wine.p  pWindows XP is even worse the codeGetDCExcode call which is straight out of MSDN fails with no last error code set, and changing it to use the seemingly equivalent codeGetWindowDCcode results in a transparent correct red border, a transparent correct  red border, and the whole window having the titlebar color, respectively. wine output doesnt change.p  pAm I misunderstanding something about codeWMNCCALCSIZEcode I know all inputs and outputs are in the same coordinate space, so I assumed I could just mainpulate those coordinates and call it a day. I did try handling the valid rectangles fields codergrc[1]codecodergrc[2]code, both by setting them to empty rectangles and by making codergrc[1]code set to the new client rect, but neither fixed the issue here.p  pThe codeMoveWindowcode also doesnt seem to be it if I remove that and keep the popover at its initial size, it still draws as above, with the same corrupt red border problem.p  pThanks.p  pHere is the code. Because it is a test to figure out what to do, theres no error checking yet.

Negative 201 pPlease excuse me if its a very basic question but im totally lost on this as Im new to IIS and kerberos delegation but have understanding of auth protocols. Need you peoples help please. I have almost checked all the related questions on this site and serverfault but to no avail. p  pHere is my setup details I have a private domain dom.local and 2 more member servers on this domain. on both nodes i have installed IIS 7.5 windows 2008 R2 servers. I have configured very simple setup where in node1 acting as reverse proxy rewrite rule redirects all request to backend node2 hosting another http 1 page dummy application only.p  pNode1 is protected using basic and is configured with kcd and protocol transition with proper SPNs and node2 with windows auth. p  pso if im accessing node1.dom.local it asks basic auth but while redirecting to node2 it agains prompts for auth which it should not.p  pNowhere on the internet i found that i have to write my own .net application to impersonate and do protocol transition. But Microsoft support is saying that you have to write your own application to impersonate and do protocol transition. p  pWhich im finding hard to digest for such a simple use case, i feel IIS should automatically do it for me.

Negative 201 pI understand that whats passed into codesrandcode as an argument will be used as the seed for calls to coderandcode that happen afterward.  Generally codetimeNULLcode is passed in.p  pBut if you only call codesrandcode once, and then you have coderandcode being called continuously in a loop, how are the numbers different from each other  The seed was the value returned from codetimeNULLcode...but ONLY that one specific return value is being used.  So how are different numbers being generatedp  pI dont know anything about threading in C.  But is codesrandcode using threads and a different seed each time so that subsequent calls to coderandcode actually do return random numbers  I noticed that when I pass a static number to codesrandcode instead of codetimeNULLcode, the coderandcode is still generating random numbers.p

Negative 201 pI have a job that gets submitted every hour at 15 minutes past each hour via a Spring cron expression.

Negative 201 pHeres my situation. I have a Joomla 3.3.6 install sitting in a subdirectory, which Ill call codejoomlacode. It needs to stay in that subdirectory and I need it to be accessed through urls like codemysite.comenmypagecode instead of codemysite.comjoomlaenmypagecode. I have other services living on the same host that need to remain accessible, all in other subdirectories.p  pI also have three domain names for the same server as parked domains hosted by a webhost that uses cpanel, not something I can change, say codemysiteA.comcode, codemysiteB.comcode and codemysiteC.comcode  they should all point to the same Joomla install transparently, i.e. codemysiteA.comenmypage  mysiteB.comenmypagecode.p  pNow I successfully redirected all requests to the joomla subdirectory, effectively hiding it, with a combination ofp  pstrong.htaccessstrong inspired by a hrefhttpwww.jayway.com20090131howtogetyourjoomlainasubdirectorytoworkatonecom relnofollowthis blog postap  precode Turn modrewrite on RewriteEngine On  Do a permanent redirect from something.tld to www.something.tld yeswww RewriteCond HTTPHOST www [NC] RewriteRule . httpwww.HTTPHOST1 [R301,L]  Hide the joomla subdirectory joomla RewriteCond REQUESTURI joomla RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . joomla1 [L]  RewriteRule  joomlaindex.php [L] codepre  pandp  pstrongjoomlaconfiguration.phpstrongp  precode... public livesite  httpwww.mysiteA.com ... codepre  pNow heres the thing.

Negative 201 pI am working on a multitenant solution with Azure AD with web apps and a web api. The web app uses OpenIdConnect to retrieve a bearer token which is cached in Azure Redis Cache, which is used in Angular to get JSON from the web api. User impersonation is used between the web app and web api set up in Azure AD applications. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pThis works fine for about an hour, then the Identity suddenly disappears on the web api side. If I refresh the web app, I see that the page is redirected to the Microsoft login page, but no action is required since the user is just redirected back to the web app and everything works again. As far as I can see, the web app uses the same bearer token when it fails and after the refresh same expire time when it works again. AuthenticationContext.AcquireTokenSilent works in both scenarios.p  pI have tried to increase a lot of different timeouts, but nothing has helped. I have also disabled all but bearer token authentication on the web api. I do not understand why the identity disapears and why it helps to refresh the client.

Many MVC menu items which each lead to an Angular single page application for that menu item. MVC is used for routing, authentication and authorization. In addition, additional claims is retrieved and appended to the current principal server side. The menu items are MVC controllers that are protected with the Authorized and ClaimsPrincipalPermission attributes. Since the web page will run in Azure, we changed the default sessionProvider to Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisSessionStateProvider. Only the MVC server side talks to this redis session cache.  The bearer token not refresh token is shared with Angular through an Authorized protected MVC controller, which is then stored in the browser session storage similar to adal.js use of localstorage Angular gets JSON content from a CORS enabled API that lives in a separate domain from the MVC app. The API and MVC app also belong to two different Azure AD applications. p

Negative 201 pGood day folks . I am building a relational database . I am at the ERD Stage and i am having a  problem. The situation is a customer can either be representing themselves or a company  and a company might have different customers because of different departments. p  pthe problem is i need to link the customers and company table, as to run queries such as what organisation a customer works for, but not all customers rep a company therefore i am thinking i cannot put the comID attribute as a foreign key in the customer table or put the cID in the company table because there are instances where a customer doesnt represent a org therefore the foreign key would be null in some instances which i know cannot happen...Any suggestions would be great. p  pThank you very much for your time p

Negative 201 pI went through the drf sites quickstart tutorial with my own models that contain a lot of m2m and foreignkey relationships.

Negative 201 pIm attempting to load YouTube videos via their direct video URL retrieved using a hrefhttpsgithub.comfentnodeytdlcore relnofollowytdlcorea. I load them using the coderequestcode library. I then pipe the result to a stream, which is used as the input to ffmpeg via a hrefhttpsgithub.comfluentffmpegnodefluentffmpeg relnofollowfluentffmpega.

However, the audio is missing any information about its size or duration and all other metadata. This also makes it unseekable.p  pIm assuming this is lost somewhere during the codeffmpegcode stage, because if I load the video directly via the URL passed to coderequestcode it loads and plays fine, and has a set durationis seekable.

Then, in an attempt to overload the system, I, again, continuously pressed kbdCtrlkbdkbdShiftkbdkbdRkbd. The memory usage sharply dropped back down to around 175MB, and floats around that number.p  pThis suggests that memory allocated for the connections are not shut down until someone access the page. Until then, memory will creep up.p  pstrongIs this assumption correct If true, Why does memory keeps creeping up even when no one is visiting it site is authenticated using usernamepassword Why does it only go down when some connects, and not automatically Will this cause an OOM error eventuallystrongp

Negative 201 pJust like in the native iOS Mail app, when I push a UITableViewController onto a UINavigationController, I would like to make it so that the UITableView initially appears slightly scrolled downwards, obscuring its headerView beneath the navigation controllers navigation bar. p  pAt the same time, even if the height of all of the cells is smaller than the height of the table view, it should be possible for the user to scroll up and down to explicitly show or hide the header view again.p  pWith that logic, it would appear that there are two considerations to make for this implementationp  p1 Ensuring that the minimum content size of the table view is at least the height of the table views frame  the height of the header view.p  p2 When the table view is initially presented, the content offset is incremented by the height of the header view.p  pIve tried manually setting both the contentOffset and contentSize properties of the table view in viewWillAppear, however this appears to have no effect Its possible the table view is getting reloaded after that point. Trying to set them in viewDidAppear will work, but thats too late as it only gets called once the push animation has completed.p  pWhile this sort of question has been asked before for previous iOS versions, I was unable to get any of them working in iOS 8. Additionally, they all dealt with changing the offset, but not the contentSize of the table view.p  pHas anyone gotten this sort of behavior working in iOS 7 andor 8 beforep

Negative 201 pstrongResolved.strongp  pThe problem was that I was defining quartz jobs with identities that have a unique group id the scheduler id instead of a group id common to all hosts in the cluster. Since the scheduler id is unique to the host, each host in the cluster would look to see if that job already existed using the fully qualified job name groupId.jobName and surely it found it didnt, so it would create a new instance of Job1 and Job2 during startup. The quartz jobstriggers are never expired or cleared without an explicit request in Java or manual sql statement in Oracle. So over time the instances would build up, and instead of quartz running a single instance of Job1 and Job2, it would run all the instances of each job that had been created over time hence the multiple executions and multiple email alerts.p  pThe solution is that I replace schedulerId with a static string such as MyQuartzJobs when defining a jobs identity.p  pBasically, I changed the following line of Java codep  precodeJobDetail job   newJobJob1.class.withIdentityJOB1JOBNAME,  uniqueSchedulerId .withDescriptionJOB1DESC   created [  new Date  ] .storeDurablyfalse .requestRecoveryfalse .build codepre  pto something like the followingp  precodeJobDetail job   newJobJob1.class.withIdentityJOB1JOBNAME,  MyQuartzJobs .withDescriptionJOB1DESC   created [  new Date  ] .storeDurablyfalse .requestRecoveryfalse .build codepre  p Original Postp  pstrongGoalstrong         Have Job1 run once for a threenode cluster every 10 minutes, and Job2 run once for the same cluster every 5 minutes. Each job generates an email so at 1055am I should receive only one Job2 email from the cluster, and at 1100am I should receive one Job1 email and one Job2 email from the cluster, at 1105am I should receive only one Job2 email from the cluster, and so on...p  pstrongProblemstrong         Job1 is being run multiple times every 10 minutes on each node in the cluster, and the same for Job2 except every 5 minutes. This leads to many, many more than one or two emails.p  pstrongConfigurationstrong      Threenode linux cluster      Each machine NTP configured and timesyncd      Oracle DB      Quartz v2.2.0 cluster mode          Jobs configured via CronTrigger      Each node has an instance of the same standalone Java application running on it, and the Java application instantiates an instance of the quartz scheduler in clustermode.      quartz.properties files are identical on each machine. p  pI have investigated all the obvious potential causes, but nothing explains it or presents a fix. I have even tried inserting an artificial 10second sleep instruction in the job, to ensure that it doesnt finish in under a second.

Negative 201 pI have a product called Domain Name Registration. It has attributes for domain extensions and for action. Action can either be register, transfer or own domain.

However, in the case that the action is own domain, the price must be set to 0. p  pIn other words, the ACTION attribute, must override ALL other attribute pricing should it be own domain.

Two important facts p  p1 Were using EF 6 with Lazy Loading as suggested by the virtual keywords.p  p2 Since every book is tracked individually the number of Book entries in the database will become great quickly. The table will likely have a size of hundreds of millions on the long run. We will perhaps be adding up to 100,000 books per day.p  pThe opinion I supported is that the current implementation is fine and that were not going to run into problems. My understanding is that a SQL statement would be generated to filter the collection when GetEnumerator is called.p  pThe other suggestion made by my coworker is to cache the number of books. That means updating a field int ComputedNumberOfBooks whenever the AddBookToStock or SellBook methods would be called. This field would need to be repeated and updated in both the Store and Corporation classes. Then of course we would need to take care of concurrencyp  pI know adding these fields wouldnt be a big deal, but I really feel bad about this idea. To me it looks like preengineering a problem that doesnt exist, and that in my opinion wont exist.p  pI decided to check again my claims with SO and found 2 contradicting answers p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6309151arenavigationpropertiesreadeachtimetheyareaccessedef41One saying that the whole Books collection would be pulled to memorya, since ICollection only inherits from IEnumerable. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20342174entityframeworkfilteringnavigationpropertiesThe other saying the opposite  the navigation property will be treated as an IQueryable until it is evaluateda.Why not since the property is wrapped by a proxy p  pSo here are my questions  p  p1 What is the truth p  p2 Even if the whole collection is referenced, dont you think that its not a big deal since it would be an IEnumerable low memory usage.p  p3 What do you think of the memory consumption  performance hit on this example, and what would be the best way to go      p  pThank youp

By inserting codeprintlncodes and implementing the codeDropcode trait for the boxed value, I saw that the box containing the value 1 will be deallocated at either line 6 or 7 depending on the return value of codeflipcoincode. How does the compiler know when to deallocate that box Is this decided at runtime using some runtime information like a flag to indicate if the box is still in usep

In addition, a session token, should be retrieved upon successful validation. The part codetaskuser.logincode means it is taking you to controller file user to the function login. componentscomuserscontrollersuser.php and find the function login.I understand also that Joomla has its own method to check the form token. You can codeJSessioncheckTokenpost or jexitJTextJInvalidTokencode.p  pHowever, my understanding for login process, is that this function codelogincode should send POST request to the server with username and password credentials, and then the server will validate and send back a sessionToken. p  pThe problem is, I could not understand in the below function, where the credentials are being sent via POST request and where the sessionToken is received I supposed there must be some URL to send POST, where is that p  precodepublic function login      JSessioncheckTokenpost or jexitJTextJInvalidToken      app  JFactorygetApplication       Populate the data array     data  array     data[return]  base64decodeJRequestgetVarreturn, , POST, BASE64     data[username]  JRequestgetVarusername, , method, username     data[password]  JRequestgetStringpassword, , post, JREQUESTALLOWRAW     lang  JRequestgetVarlang,post       Set the return URL if empty.     if emptydata[return]          data[return]  index.phpoptioncomusersampviewprofile     else          iflang             lang  mbsubstrlang, 0, 2             data[return] . amplang.lang                      Set the return URL in the user state to allow modification by plugins     appgtsetUserStateusers.login.form.return, data[return]       Get the log in options.     options  array     options[remember]  JRequestgetBoolremember, false     options[return]  data[return]       Get the log in credentials.     credentials  array     credentials[username]  data[username]     credentials[password]  data[password]       Perform the log in.     if true  appgtlogincredentials, options           Success         appgtsetUserStateusers.login.form.data, array         appgtredirectJRouteappgtgetUserStateusers.login.form.return, false      else           Login failed          data[remember]  intoptions[remember]         appgtsetUserStateusers.login.form.data, data         appgtredirectJRouteindex.phpoptioncomusersampviewlogin, false       codepre  pMy objective is to mimic the request using JavaScript so that I can perform login using external mobile App. In other words, I need to write the same logic in JavaScript so I can login to the website from mobile App..p

Negative 201 pIm working with code that expects utf8encoded stdstring variables. I want to be able to handle a usersupplied file that potentially has utf16 encoding I dont know the encoding at design time, but eventually want to be able to deal with utf81632, read it linebyline, and forward each line to the rest of the code as a utf8encoded stdstring.p  pI have c11 really, the current MSVC subset of c11 and boost 1.55.0 to work with. Ill need the code to work on both Linux and Windows variants eventually. For now, Im just prototyping on Windows with Visual Studio 2013 Update 4, running on Windows 7. Im open to additional dependencies, but theyd need to have an established crossplatform meaning windows and nix track record, and shouldnt be GPLLGPL.p  pIve been making assumptions that I dont seem to be able to find a way to validate, and I have code that is not working.p  pOne assumption is that, since I ultimately want each line from these files in a stdstring variable, I should be working with stdifstream imbued with a properlyconstructed codecvt such that the incoming utf16 stream can be converted to utf8.p  pIs this assumption realistic The alternative, I thought, would be that Id have to do some encoding checks on the text file, and then choose wifstreamwstring or ifstreamstring based on the results, which seemed more unappealing than Id like to start with. Of course, if thats the right or the only realistic path, Im open to it.p  pI realize that I may likely need to do some encoding detection anyway, but for now, I am not so concerned about the encoding detection part, just focusing on getting utf16 file contents into utf8 stdstring.p  pI have tried a variety of different combinations of locale and codecvt, none of which have worked. Below is the latest incarnation of what I thought might work, but doesntp  precodevoid SomeRandomClassreadUtf16LeFile const stdstringamp theFileName       boostlocalegenerator gen     stdifstream file theFileName      auto utf8Locale  gen.generate UTF8      stdlocale cvtLocale utf8Locale,                            new stdcodecvtutf8utf16ltchargt       file.imbue utf8Locale      stdstring line      stdcout.imbue utf8Locale      for  int i  0 i lt 3 i               stdgetline file, line          stdcout ltlt line ltlt stdendl       codepre  pThe behavior I see with this code is that the result of each call to getline is an empty string, regardless of the file contents.p  pThis same code works fine meaning, each getline call returns a correctlyencoded nonempty string on a utf8encoded version of the same file if I omit lines 3 and 5 of the above method.p  pFor whatever reason, I could not find any examples anywhere here on SO or on a hrefhttpen.cppreference.com relnofollowhttpen.cppreference.coma, or elsewhere in the wild, of anyone trying to do this same thing.p  pAll ideassuggestions conformant to requirements above welcome.p

Negative 201 pI am using this a hrefhttpsgithub.comoguzbilgenerCircularFloatingActionMenu relnofollowCircularFloatingActionMenuap  pI have been able to use it so far pretty well. I am able to move it to desired positions as described in the ReadMe and even set rotation, theme coloring etc. My problem is I am trying to create a custom animation so that when placed in the upper right the icons shoot downwards. I kind of cheated and got it to appear to work by setting the startend angle at 89 and 90 degrees so instead of being in a line they are just slightly off, but my problem is that when the animation finishes the final position ends up stacking all the icons on top of one another.

Negative 201 pIm having some trouble updating the size of my codeUIScrollViewcode to adjust to my codeUITableViewcode height changes.p  pmy codeUITableViewcode is not scrollable. Instead the size of my view changes based on the amount of cells in my codeUITableViewcode.p  pI have one codeUIViewControllercode That I use to load 3 different datasets. which requires to update my UITableView to accommodate different amounts of data oftenp  pSo when I load the first dataset it works fine.p  pHowever, if I load a new one after that, with a different amount of cells. My contentSize of my UIScrollView is now wrong. it keeps the size from whatever the previous dataset was.p  pHeres an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compPzL0.png altenter image description herep  pWhere I went from a dataset that had more cells. To one with less. You can see Im able to scroll down much further than I should be able to. The end of the contentSize should be stopping 16 points after the white area.p  pAfter attempting to fix this issue for a while, I did manage to get something working. I get my data from an API, which sometimes take a long time to fetch. However, when Its done updating all the data in my tableView I was able to fix the contentsize to what I want with the following line of codep  precodeself.scrollView.contentSize  CGSizewidthself.view.bounds.width, height self.contentView.frame.height codepre  pFirst action after that worked, was to put that earlier. Before I attempt to update the data. But unfortunately that doesnt seem to do anything at all.p  pSo how can I as soon as I reload my UITableView with the data from CoreData before attempting to fetch new data set my contentSize correctlyp  pHere is the function that loads the data. This happens instantly.

Negative 201 pIm maintaining the servers of a web game.

I dont want to do this kind of job whenever a new machine comes in.p  pIs there a tool that allows me to save the state of a linux machine so that next time when we buy a new server, I can copy the state of an old linux machine to the new machine I think this is one of the ways to automize the process of setting up a new game server.p  pIve also tried using some .sh scripts to automize the process.

Negative 201 pSome of the gnome applications on linux use a help browser called codeyelpcode.  For example, the gnomecalculator, codegcalctoolcode, has its help files located in codeusrsharegnomehelpgcalctoolcode p  pThe folders there are then sorted by language.  These help files essentially consist of an xml file and some accompanying png figures.  p  pWhat Im trying to do is convert this xml and its accompanying png figures into static HTML because I want to be able to properly view and navigate the document from a different browser firefox. If you want to see what Im talking about and you are on Linux, just run codegcalctoolcode and open the help menu.  p  pUnfortunately, opening the xml directly with firefox is not successful because there are no stylesheets and thus firefox doesnt know how to format it.  I have read that gnome applications make use of a library called codelibxsltcode a hrefhttpxmlsoft.orglibxslt relnofollowhttpxmlsoft.orglibxslta for applying stylesheets.  I am not familiar with xslt at all.  Are the stylesheets saved elsewhere, or embedded in the source when it is compiledp  pI guess what Im wondering is if its possible to somehow use libxslt by itself or another tool to convert the xml and figures into static HTML, preferably in the same manner yelp does this when it executes, or in a manner that results in an exactvery similar output to what yelp displays.p  pThanksp

Negative 201 pI understand threading to a certain extent, but in practice I have little experience. In looking at this code that I am maintaining, it seems that the AWAIT provides no benefit. All calls to this method are via AJAX and happen only when a user clicks an export link. Since the method does nothing else, I dont see any advantage to AWAIT and instead imagine that it actually introduces some overhead. I also believe that all other users clicking export would be entering this method as their own thread, right So this might only be useful if a single user clicked export many times, quickly Thank you.p  precode[PreventLogging]     [HttpPost]     public async TaskltJsonResultgt GetActivityReportCallsAsync[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request              try                      var result  await GetAllCallsAsync             return Jsonresult.ToDataSourceResultrequest                  catch Exception exc                      return JsonShowMessagefalse, ServerMessageType.Error, exc.Message               codepre

Negative 201 pI am having some C code strongmy test objectstrong which is interacting with some external library. To do some component testing I have written a strongstub for external librarystrong. I am using stronggoogle test frameworkstrong to write test cases. I am seding some signals between my test object and google tests which means I am having 2 processes. 1 for google test and 1 for my test object. Everything works fine. p  pNow instead of using strongstubbed librarystrong I want to use strongFake Function Framework fff.hstrong which auto generate stubbes at compile time. I know how to generate stubbes but the problem is that it will work if we have a single process but I want to use it for multiple processes. As the stubbed functions are generated at compile time is there any way to access them from another process p

Negative 201 pIm working with a repository that in theory should be following the Gitflow Workflow see a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodel relnofollowA successful git branching modela by Vincent Driessen. However, the initial commit on the repository was made on the codedevelopcode branch and there is no codemastercode branch to be seen. Its nearing release time and I need to create a codemastercode branch that reflects the productionready state of the project which shouldve been there from the start. Keep in mind that the codedevelopcode branch has multiple feature branches coming off of it. The repository is entirely local and hasnt been pushed.p  pMy idea was to create an orphan branch codemastercode and rebase the codedevelopcode branch onto it, but I dont know how Id go about doing that.p  pSo, how can I create the codemastercode branch as if it was created from the startp  pstrongUpdatestrong In my case, the first commit on codedevelopcode is not a commit that should be considered suitable for production, so using this as the initial codemastercode commit would be unwise. The reason that the project is in this state is because it was originally not using a VCS when it was decided to use Git.p

However, the polymorphicids in the json file are not clear to me.p  pHere a more clear example  This is the object, which is generated by the cereal framework p  precode     array1 [                      key 0,             value                  ptrwrapper                      id 2147483649,  ID1                     data                          ...some float fields...                                                            ,                  key 1,         value              ptrwrapper                  id 2147483650,  This is previous ID1 and so on...                 data                      ... some float fields...                                                                 ],     array2 [                      key 0,             value                  polymorphicid 2147483649,  this is the very first ID from array 1.                 polymorphicname mystructname,                 ptrwrapper                      id 2147483651, this ID1N Elements from array1                     data                          ... also some float stuff...                                                                 ]  codepre  pp  pAs I observe the number generation, the very first ID is increased. The second array uses the first ID as its polymorphic ID and further increases the numbers.p  pSo is there some logic why these numbers have been used Is it save to just use them all the time or will these change when I run my c importer on another machinep

Negative 201 pI know that you should generally have at least 32 threads running per block on CUDA since threads are executed in groups of 32.  However I was wondering if it is considered an acceptable practice to have only one block with a bunch of threads I know there is a limit on the number of threads.  I am asking this because I have some problems which require the shared memory of threads and synchronization across every element of the computation.  I want to launch my kernel like codecomputeSomethingltltlt 1, 256 gtgt...code  and just used the threads to do the computation.  Is this efficient to just have one block, or would I be better off just doing the computation on the cpup

Negative 201 pI created a web page to login to Facebook and then once logged in, create a session which stores the access token and also the user id. And then I redirect the user to a profile page where it pulls the information from users facebook posts via a Graph API call and then presents the information. Im using PHP to get the Graph API.p  pIts working fine on my local machine and I can see the data just as I want. But when I access the same link from outside my home network, It displays a blank page. I can still login from outside the home network so that piece of code works fine, but it is unable to pull the userposts. Theres nothing wrong with the code as far as I understand otherwise I wont be able to access the link even from my local network.p  pI tried many different solutions, added a whitelist of IPaddresses but it may be that Im not adding them in the correct place. Im at a total loss. Has someone experienced a similar situation If adding the specific ip addresses would help, where do I add them exactly. There are so many confusing fields in the Facebook developers settings. p  pAny help is much appreciated.p
