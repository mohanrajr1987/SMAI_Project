Positive 5382 pFor a few days, Ive been working on developing a Newsfeed using the Neo4j Graph Database and toying around with various ways of including an Activity Log similar to Facebook that will keep track of every user action.p  pFor example, User1 sends a friend request to User2 which would translate to something like this in Cypherp  precodeMATCH     meUser username john.snowgmail.com,      friendUser username arya.starkgmail.com  WHERE      NOT me[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]FriendshipStatus[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]friend  CREATE     me[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]friendshipStatusFriendshipStatus status 0[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]gtfriend  RETURN     me,     friendshipStatus,     friend codepre  pPretty basic stuff so far, just create 2 relationships and 1 node that contains all the information regarding their friendship.p  pRetrieving both outgoing and incoming events is also pretty simplep  precodeMATCH     meUser username john.snowgmail.com[actionName]gtactionData[]gtfriendUser  RETURN     me,     typeactionName AS actionName,     actionData,     friend  UNION MATCH     meUserlt[actionName]actionDatalt[]friendUser  RETURN     me,     typeactionName AS actionName,     actionData,     friend codepre  pBut, lets say User2 declines User1 friend request, which would end up deleting the entire relationship between them.

The days would then contain the events the user performed or has been exposed to in that particular day when creating an event, it is pushed to the friend timeline also  see the second code block and keeping direct relationships between user friendship updates, likes, etc for speed so I dont have to search thru all the Day nodes. p  pEdit Forgot to mention why I didnt stick with that particular design.p  pThe problem was that there was no similarity between the actions for example a like is directed to a post while a friendship request is directed to a user, which made me end up with multiple, unwanted joins.p  pWhat would be a good database design to keep track of all these actions, even if they get deletedp  pThank you in advance.p

Positive 5382 pIm wondering if there is a function within igraph to calculate connection probabilities among vertices in a weighted graph, where the weights for the edges are probabilities of connection of the adjacent vertices.p  pIve built a graph based on such an adjacency matrix where adjacent connection probabilities form the weights this is for a river network so each node of the graph is only connected to a single downstream node. p  pI had hoped to use something like the codeshortest.pathscode function in igraph but that sums the weights rather than calculates the product of them and I cant work out a way to change that. p  pThe example below shows how I construct the adjacency matrix from the data I have, which is the probability that the vertex is connected to its downstream vertex ProbConn and then the identity of the downstream vertex downstream.  The most downstream vertex is the river mouth so it is connected to no other hence the vector called downstream begins with NA.p  precodelibraryigraph   vector of probability of connectivity to downstream vertex ProbConn lt c0, 1, 0.945881098491627, 0.997349787519144, 0.891475447373691, 0.993221681072185, 0.48071450525165, 0.0292543433507856, 0.0248645581575872, 1, 0.00540807765075205, 0.661465657844344, 0.108524549747512, 0.383311676351655, 0.708853495942148, 0.00150109592270933, 0.463859846404347, 0.0011491165581467, 2.87879700370202e09, 0.536140153595653, 0.00831752330277812, 0.00185182893416988, 0.0186237313262708, 0.398961560996748, 0.582414707676981, 0.338534342155656, 1, 0.00137024127706289, 0.291146504057852, 1, 0.0743301054564134, 0.0514743607033332, 1, 1   the downstream vertex of each node downstream lt cNA, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 2, 7, 5, 8, 4, 6, 10, 3, 11, 3, 4, 11, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 8, 12, 5, 10, 13, 6, 6, 14, 15   Create the adjacency matrix from these vectors adjacPI lt matrix0, nrowlengthdownstream, ncollengthdownstream  Set up the adjacency matrix to build the distance matrix  for i in 1lengthdownstream    adjacPI[i, downstream[i]] lt ProbConn[i]   Fill the adjacency matrix    create the graph reflecting the downstream connectivity PIgraph lt graph.adjacencyadjacPI, weightedT plotPIgraph  visualise the graph   PIpath lt shortest.pathsPIgraph, modeout   creates  the shortest paths matrix based on summing the distances of each step along each path    codepre  pTo extract an example from the shortest paths matrix PIpath, vertices 10 and 34 are connected via vertex 15.

Positive 5382 pAlthough there are a few questions on this topic, i would need some piece of advice in a more specific matter.p  pI am working on some project where i have to rename an entity. This implies saving a new object containing the old and the new name of the entity. This is how the soft works.p  pNow, what i have to do is check if a circular dependency is attempted when someone tries to rename an object. For examplep  precodeA gt B B gt C C gt A codepre  pWhen someone tries to rename C into A, this should be signaled.p  pI am not sure how to approach this problem. My thought was to create a directed graph having the edges[A, B], [B, C], [C, A] and the apply some cycle detecting algorithms to find the circular dependencies Tarjan or something.p  pWould that be efficient considering that the graph will not be connected It is possible to have the aforementioned example and then p  precodeE gt F H gt J X gt Y codepre  pI will end up with a lot of unconnected edges and a few cycles maybe.

Positive 5382 pSo I have an exercise that I should prove or disprove thatp  p1 if e is a minimum weight edge in the connected graph G such that not all edges are necessarily distinct, then every minimum spanning tree of G contains ep  p2 Same as 1 but now all edge weights are distinct.p  hr  pOk so intuitively, I understand that for 1 since not all edge weights are distinct, then its possible that a vertex has the path with edge e but also another edge e1 such that if weighte  weight e1 then there is a spanning tree which does not contain the edge e since the graph is connected. Otherwise if both e1 and e are in the minimum spanning tree, then there is a cycle p  pand for 2 since all edge weights are distinct, then of course the minimum spanning tree will contain the edge e since any algorithm will always choose the smaller path. p  pAny suggestions on how to prove these two though induction Not sure how to approach. p

Negative 5382 pUsing Rails v2.1, lets say you have an action for a controller that is accessible from more than one location.  For example, within the Rails app, you have a link to edit a user from two different views, one on the users index view, and another from another view lets say from the nav bar on every page.p  pIm wondering what is the best way to redirect the user back to the right spot depending on what link they clicked on.

Negative 5382 pThis is a question that has been bugging me for a while and I am no longer working in this so sorry for the lack of code. The situation is this I had a web service that in the client and the server page it had compression and it had encryption.

Still there was a set of data that was very BIG and it exceeded the limit of normal string 33 thousand or something characters.p  pThis step happened in the packing and unpacking steps of web services. What was being returned is a Datasetthat in webservices it converts to an XML. p  pI know StringBuilder can be helpful but I assume that when you change it toString it will trim the string to the max limit. p

Negative 5382 pFirst of, I have read many explanations on SO and blogs about covariance and contravariance and a big thanks goes out to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers88656ericlippertEric Lipperta for producing such a great series on a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comericlippertarchivetagsCovarianceanddefault.aspxCovariance and Contravariancea.p  pHowever I have a more specific question that I am trying to get my head around a little bit.p  pAs far as I understand per a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comericlippertarchive20091130whatsthedifferencebetweencovarianceandassignmentcompatibility.aspxErics explanationa is that Covariance and Contravariance are both adjectives that describe a transformation. Covariant transformation is that which preserves the order of types and Contravariant transformation is one that reverses it.p  pI understand covariance in such a manner that I think most developers understand intuitively.p  precodecovariant operation Animal someAnimal  new Giraffe  assume returns Mammal, also covariant operation someAnimal  Mammal.GetSomeMammal codepre  pThe return operation here is covariant as we are preserving the size in which both Animal is still bigger than Mammal or Giraffe. On that note most return operations are covariant, contravariant operations would not make sense.p  precode  if return operations were contravariant   the following would be illegal   as Mammal would need to be stored in something   equal to or less derived than Mammal   which would mean that Animal is now less than or equal than Mammal   therefore reversing the relationship   Animal someAnimal   Mammal.GetSomeMammal codepre  pThis piece of code of course would not make sense to most developers.p  pMy confusion lies in Contravariant argument parameters. If you had a method such asp  precodebool CompareMammal mammal1, Mammal mammal2 codepre  pI have always learned that input parameters always force contravariant behavior. Such that if the type is used as an input parameter its behavior should be contravariant. p  pHowever what is the difference between the following codep  precodeMammal mammal1  new Giraffe covariant Mammal mammal2  new Dolphin covariant  Comparemammal1, mammal2 covariant or contravariant or Comparenew Giraffe, new Dolphin covariant or contravariant codepre  pBy the same token that you cant do something like this you cant dop  precode   not valid    Mammal mammal1  new Animal     not valid    Comparenew Animal, new Dolphin codepre  pI guess what I am asking is, what makes method argument passing a contravariant transformation.p  pSorry for the long post, maybe I am understand this incorrectly.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pPer some conversation below, I understand that for instance using a delegate layer can clearly show contravariance. Consider the following examplep  precodelegal, covariance Mammal someMammal  new Mammal Animal someAnimal  someMammal   legal in C 4.0, covariance because defined in Interface IEnumerableltMammalgt mammalList  Enumerable.EmptyltMammalgt IEnumerableltAnimalgt animalList  mammalList  because of this, one would assume that the following line is legal as well  void ProcessMammalMammal someMammal  ActionltMammalgt processMethod  ProcessMammal ActionltAnimalgt someAction  processMethod codepre  pOf course this is illegal because someone can pass any Animal to someAction, where as the ProcessMammal expects anything thats Mammal or more specific  lesser than Mammal . Which is why someAction has to only be Action or anything more specific Actionp  pHowever this is introducing a layer of delegates in the middle, is it necessary that for a contravariant projection to happen there has to be a delegate in the middle And if we were to define Process as an interface we would declare  the argument parameter as a contravariant type only because we wouldnt want someone to be able to do what I had shown above with delegatesp  precodepublic interface IProcessltout Tgt      void ProcessT val  codepre

I thought for a second Id rather not start blindly running this code over all my fairly locked down Facebook information so let me check it out.p  pThe bookmarklet is simple enough, but it calls another javascript function which at the time but not anymore was highly compressed and undecipherable  though understandbly more for optimization than obfuscation.  Thats when I said nope, not gonna do it.  So even though I could have verified the original uncompressed javascript from the a hrefhttpgithub.commjpizzreclaimprivacyGithub sitea and even saved a local copy to verify and then run without hitting their server, I wasnt going to.  Its several thousand lines and Im not a total javascript guru to begin with.p  pYet, folks are using it anyway.  Even supposedly bright developers.  What makes them trust the script  Did they all scrutinize it line by line  Do they know the guy personally and trust him not to do anything bad  Do they just take his wordp  pstrongWhat makes you trust that a piece of open source software is not maliciousstrongp  pNote, to clarify, the reason I limit the scope of the discussion to open source software is because with open source software it can often be a matter of do I want to expend the effort to do a proper analysis or should I just go ahead  When the opportunity to check is there, when do you skip it and just implicitly trust the software p

Negative 5382 pIm implementing a document viewer with highlightingannotation capabilities for a custom document format on iPad. The documents are kind of long 100 to 200 pages, if printed on paper and Ive had a hard time finding the right approach. Here are the requirmentsp  p1 Basic richtext styling control of leftright margins. Control of font name, size, foregroundbackground color, and line spacing. Bold, italics, underline, etc.p  p2 Selection and highlighting of arbitrary text regions not limited to paragraph boundaries, like in SafariUIWebView.p  p3 Customization of the CutCopyPaste popup UIMenuController This is one of the essential requirements of the app.p  pMy first implementation was based on UIWebView. I just rendered the document as HTML with CSS for text styling. But I couldnt get the kind of text selection behavior I wanted across paragraph boundaries and the UIMenuController cant be customized from within UIWebView.p  pSo I started working on a javascript approach, faking the device textselection behavior using JQuery to trap touch events and dynamically modifying the DOM to change the background color of selected regions of text. I built a fake UIMenuController control as a hidden DIV, positioning it and unhiding it whenever there was an active selection region.p  pNot too shabby.p  pThe main problem is that its SLOOOOOOOW. Scrolling through the document is nice and quick, but dynamically changing the DOM is not very snappy. Plus, I couldnt figure out how to recreate the magnifier loupe, so my fake textselection GUI doesnt look quite the same as the native implementation. Also, I havent yet implemented the communication bridge between the javascript layer and the objectivec layer where the rest of the app lives, but it was shaping up to be a huge hassle.p  pSo Ive been looking at CoreText, but there are precious few examples on the web. I spent a little time with this simple little demop  pa hrefhttpgithub.comjonasschnelliI7CoreTextExample relnofollowhttpgithub.comjonasschnelliI7CoreTextExampleap  pIt shows how to use CoreText to draw an NSAttributedText string into a UIView. But it has its own problems It doesnt implement textselection behavior, and it doesnt present a UIMenuController, so I dont have any idea how to make that happen. And, more importantly, it tries to draw the entire document all at once, with significant performance degradations for long documents. My documents can have thousands of paragraphs, and less than 1 of the document is ever on screen at a time.p  pOn the plus side, these documents already contain precise formatting information. I know the exact pageposition of every line of text, so I dont need a layout engine.p  pDoes anyone know how to implement this sort of view using CoreText I understand that a fullfledged implementation is overkill for a question like this, but Im looking for a good CoreText example with a few basic requirementsp  p1 Precise layout amp formatting control using the formatting metrics and text styles Ive already calculated.p  p2 Arbitrary selection of text.p  p3 Customization of the UIMenuController.p  p4 Efficient recycling of resources for offscreen objects.p  pId be happy to implement my own recycling when text elements scroll offscreen, but wouldnt that require reimplementing UIScrollViewp  pIm brandnew to iPhone development, and still getting used to ObjectiveC, but Ive been working in other languages Java, C, flexactionscript, etc for more than ten years, so I feel confident in my ability to get the work done, if only I had a better feel for the iPhone SDK and the common coding patterns for stuff like this.

Negative 5382 pstrongTLDRstrongp  blockquote   pIs there some way to add an abstract method to a base class that allows derived classes to override the methods return type, without the use of generics, and without the use of the codenewcode keywordp blockquote  hr  pIm working on developing some custom templates for LLBLGen Pro. In the process, I refuse to change the default templates that LLBLGen Pro offers, so that my approach doesnt overwrite other peoples files if they choose to implement my templates.p  pOne task Ive started working on and made good headway toward is developing a template that generates a DTO for each entity. Along those lines, one objective is to provide my entities with a codeToDTOcode method. In the interest of generic programming, Ive decided to define this method within a common base class, and this is where my trouble starts.p  hr  pemKeep in mind that the purpose of defining the codeToDTOcode method in the base class is because Im looking to create a generic repository with a codeFetchcode method, for example that Id like to have work off the codeCommonEntityBasecode, as opposed to a specific entity.emp  hr  pLLBLGen defines its codeCommonEntityBasecode class like sop  precodepublic abstract partial class CommonEntityBase  EntityBase2      LLBLGengenerated code  codepre  pMy original plan was to add my method to another partial class like sop  precodepublic abstract partial class CommonEntityBase      public abstract CommonDTOBase ToDto  codepre  pI thought that the inherited classes would be able to define the return type in their methods as a type derived from the base classs return type, like sop  precodepublic partial class PersonEntity  CommonEntityBase      public override PersonDTO ToDto return new PersonDTO   codepre  pbut a hrefhttpen.csharponline.netCSharpCodingSolutionsE28094UnderstandingtheOverloadedReturnTypeandProperty relnofollowI was wronga.p  hr  pMy second attempt was to define the class using generics, as suchp  precodepublic abstract partial class CommonEntityBaseltTgt  CommonEntityBase        where T  CommonDTOBase     public abstract T ToDto  codepre  pSimple enough.

Negative 5382 pHow can you enforce the minimum width for a TD that can optionally contain an image  I ask this because Im using a Javascript chess widget but when there are no pieces in any of the squares of a particular column, regardless of the width style of the tds being set to 36px, this column renders much narrower than those that have at least one row that contains the image of a chess piece.p  pNote that all the style is being set directly on each td cell.  I read somewhere that a possible solution would be to instead create a div inside the td and set the width on that.  Am hoping to avoid that as it might require significant modification to the underlying Javascript library.  Ive tried specifying important along with the width but it had no effect.  p  pUsing firebug I can modify the width attribute but it seems the numbers are incorrect.  For instance I can decrease the width all the way to 0 and it still appears the same.  Or I can set the width to more than 36 and it appears to grow by width36, but if for instance I set both the height and width of one of these narrow cells to the emsameem number, lets say 60px, the height of what gets displayed is greater than the width and it appears as a rectangle not a square.  p  pFurthermore not only can the td optionally contain an image, but each square specifies a background image too.  So I am at a loss   Thanks in advancep

Is it possible to override this to be something else In my particular usage, the actual sender is meaningless.p  pIm using a UITableView and setting a UISwitch in the UIAccessoryView slot on every cell. Originally, I was adding the UISwitch to the UIAccessoryView outside of the the cell initialization, which allowed each UISwitch to be a unique instance. However this creates a noticeable lag while scrolling down long list on the iPhone 3G. If I add the UIAccessoryView to the cell when its initialized, it can be dequeued instead of instantiated and eases the lag considerably.

Negative 5382 pI have a strange problem with absolute positioning and sizing elements to fit around a div. I have some div thats set in position and size on an existing page its given to me. I want to adorn it from the left and bottom with two divs, so that theyd hug it and create an L shape. I need to do this dynamically, as the div size and position change in the course of the normal usage of the web page.p  pTo achieve my goal I first get the divs offset using jquerys .offset and dimensions using .outerWidthHeight. I then calculate the divs limits top, bottom, left and use the to size and absolutely position my two divs, which are 0.5 opaque and with a high zindex see sample code. I set the divs size using jquerys .width and .height, and position using .css with the top and left properties. I tried using .offset to set positioning but did not seem to work well I ran into overlaps andor unwanted spaces in all browsers.p  pThis setting works great for FF tested on 3.6 no matter what the viewzoom setting is. However, on IE8 IE8 standards mode, and chrome tested on version 6, this will work perfectly strongonlystrong as long as viewzoom is set to 100. If set to higher say 125 in IE a 0.5px spacing will occur between the top and bottom divs c and a in my demo code for emcertainem values of the adorned divs red div b on my sample code height. when zoom is set to less than 100 say 75 in IE, overlaps of the two divs will occur for some values of the adorned divs height.p  pI created a sample page demonstrating the problem in jsbin.com  a hrefhttpjsbin.comoduxo4 relnofollowdemoa. When running this sample on IE with viewzoom set to 125 the default size of the red div should demonstrate the problem. try using the up and down buttons to change the divs height and see how things behave. you can also type a number in the textbox and then click the go button to jump to a specific height. p  pI really hope someone finds a solution for this, as Ive been banging my head against this one for quite some time, trying all kinds of different stuff here.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Following Streloks answer below, I forgot to state that I must have the hugging DIVs to be absolutely positioned in the BODY tag, so that I can be sure that theyd always overlay the rest of the page. I cant rely on them to be in the same container as the red DIV, nor change their basic positioning properties positionaboslute, as children of BODY, and the zindex.p  pstrongUpdatestrong hradac below gave an answer that solves this problem for the default zoom modes of IE. This is enough for me to constitute an answer, but if anyone else has some other idea that could solve the problem in a general way, Id love to hear it.p  pI created the sample code as a very simple demonstration of the problem I ran into.

Negative 5382 pI have a metric table that I expect to be very large.  It has a polymorphic association so that it can belongsto other models that want to record some metric.

This looks likep  pcodeaddindex comments, [commentabletype, commentableid]codep  pa hrefhttpmattfleming.comnode192But Ive also heard counsel against creating indexes of lowcardinalitya, because the payoff of the index doesnt offset the overhead of maintaining it.

The draw method basically calculates the images bitmaps needed and the x,y position to draw them on the screen. I then have an AsyncTask that loops through each tiles and download the images if it doesnt exist on the storage card local caching then once the AsyncTask has completed I then loop through the images and draw them to the canvas object that is passed into the draw method of the MapOverlay. But the bitmaps are never getting drawn.p  pI have done some rudimentary debugging by logging the width and the height of the canvas element at the time the AsyncTask completes but it is returning 0 for them so Im guessing that the canvas object is no longer available to the code running in AsyncTasks onPostExecute after the draw method has completedp  pWithout the threading I had this working pretty well, except for the freezing while panning while the image downloading blocks the UI thread.

So FacebookDirectorAction handles getting a code, and access token, and finally redirecting the user back to the original page they requested.p  precodeUrlBindingfacebookdirectordestinationdestinationParameter public class FacebookDirectorAction extends BaseActionBean       private static final String BASEREDIRECTURI  httpapps.facebook.comlawlessdevfacebookdirector     private static final String APPID  My app id     private static final String APPSECRET  My secret      public static final String AUTHVIEW  VIEWPATH  auth.jsp      private String destination     private String destinationParameter     private String code     private String accesstoken     private String authUrl      DefaultHandler     public Resolution direct throws IOException, FacebookException, ServletException          if accesstoken  null ampamp code  null              return authorize                  else if accesstoken  null              retrieveAccessToken                   If accesstoken is still null then we may mave a bad code.

Im hoping there is either a specification somewhere for the various chips perhaps, or a reliable way to measure T for each specific instruction. I know I can use any number of tools to measure aggregate processor time used, memory used, etc. I want to quantify at a lower level.p  pSo, Im able to figure out how many times I go through the main part of the algorithm. For example, I iterate coden  n1code times in a naive implementation, and between codencode best case and coden  n  n1code worst case in another. I can also make a reasonable count of the total number of instructions      , and logic statements, and I can compare those counts, but thats assuming the weight of each operation is the same. Also, I dont have any idea how to weight the actual time value of a logic statement if, else, for, while vs a mathematical operator... is if as much work as  each time I use it I would love to know where to find this information.p  pSo, for clarity, my goal is to discover how much processor time I am demanding of the CPU or GPU or any U so that I can design an optimal algorithm around processor time. Can someone give me an idea of where to start for iOS hardwarep  pEdit a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacsamplecodeSIMDPrimerListingsClockServicesc.html relnofollowThis link to ClockServices.ca and SIMD stuff in the developer portal might be a good start for people interested in this. A few more cups of coffee tonight and I might get through it p

Negative 5382 pI do like the way I can treat lists in Python. It does any recursion solution to look easy and clean.

Like in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4632322findingallpossiblecombinationsofnumberstoreachagivensum46335154633515this exampleap  pSo my question is ... are there any builin operators or helper functions in the Java API that would make this solution more Pythonic p

Negative 5382 pI am trying to crate a shared object .so using gcc version 3.4.3 for Solaris 32 bit system. I was googling for flags required to create a shared object for solaris. In some of the posts , I see that shared flag  not used. Instead G flag is used. I had an impression that G flag is same as g, but it seems that G is equivalent to shared.

Negative 5382 pI have a .NET 2.0 web application which acts as authentication stub for an older .NET 1.1 web app. So a user logs in via the 2.2 app and then gets redirected to the 1.1 app to do their business. I had used the technique a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20051210432851.aspx relnofollowdescribed by Scott Guthriea, with matching machine keys in the local web.config files, so that the auth ticket would be readable by both applications. This technique has worked for me in five instances for a couple of years.p  pUntil now.p  pAs of this morning four of our paired applications, configured as described above, have stopped working in production we get bounced back after a seemingly successful authentication attempt. During a login attempt I get bounced back to the login page. Ive checked event logs and IIS logs and found nothing of consequence. We can see the auth cookie has been set in our browsers. Weve tried multiple browsers IE and Chrome. Over the weekend I know that more than a dozen patches were installed on the web server, one of which added Framework 4.0, but I have no way of knowing whether any of these patches caused the problem. Interestingly, I noticed the same behavior on my dev box before Christmas. Since that time none of the four paired applications has been redeployed, so dont think it was a deployment issue which caused it to spread to production.p  pThere is emoneem pair of applications which is still working and were comparing the code and configuration to see whats up, but so far we havent found anything or else I wouldnt be writing this postp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I figured out what that lone pair of applications was doing right it was handling authorization through emcodeem.

Negative 5382 pI found a few threads on this using the search feature, but nothing for a purely TSQL solution.p  pthe need  A system is storing a weekly schedule as 0s and 1s in a string format to represent a week.  1 means yes, 0 means no....so 1100111 means sunday yes first one, Monday yes second 1, Tuesday no the 0...etc.p  pShort question  How do I go from an ascii char such as  to its hex code 3E and ultimately to its binary 00111110 representationp  pLong question  Im extracting from a flat file system that stores a table asp  pID int,p  ppriority1 varchar2p  p...p  pIt actually goes to priroity128 silly flat file, but Im only interested in 17 and the logic for one should be easily reused for the others.  I unfortunately have no control over this part of the extract.  The values I get look likep  p1   p  p2   edit, I actually put a symbol here that I receive from the system but the forum doesnt like.p  p3   p  p4   Yp  pI get the feeling these are appearing as their ascii chars because of the conversion as I extract.p  precodeselect convertvarbinary,gt,2 codepre  pThis returns 0x3E.  The 0x part can be ignored...  3 in binary is 0011 and E is 1110...3E  00111110.  Trim the first 0 and it leaves the 7 bit code that Im looking for.  Unfortunately I have no idea how to express this logic here in TSQL.  Any ideas  Im thinking as a function would be easiest to use...something likep  precodeselect id, binaryversionofpriority1 codepre

Negative 5382 pThe ContentValues class contains a method that allows Booleans to be put into the values collection. AFAIK, SQLite does not contain a native Boolean format that Android could push the boolean values into. So, what magic does Android do behind the scenes to store these values p  pAlso, why is there no complimentary getBoolean method on a Cursor To me, this appears to be a pretty awkward design oversight since there seems to be no safe way of retrieving a boolean value that was put into the DB via ContentValues. What am I missingp  pThis question may seem a bit frivolous since I suspect that the booleans are stored as a 1 or 0 integer, but why would Android commit to developers making that assumption Its not even documented as far as I am aware.p

Now, in any sequence of n operations, the total cost for   resizing is 1 2  48 ...2i i.e, 2 to power of i for some 2i   lt n  if all operations are pushes then 2 i will be largest power   of 2 less than n. The sum is atmost 2n  1. Adding in the additional   cost of n for insertingremoving, we get a total cost lt 3n, and our   amoritzed cost per operations is lt 3.p blockquote  pMy question is how author came to conclusion that sum is at most 2n 1. Request to help with example or proof.p  pThanksp

Negative 5382 pI have an android application that relies heavily on Json Web Services. so I have many requests and responses based on codejsoncode format. The basic idea is i have a request that gets a bean object, for example codeHotelSearchDatacode and the request knows how to convert that bean to json map object then it writes that codeJSONObjectcode to the network using codehttphttpscode.p  pnaturally I need to convert from and to codejsoncode. For the time being Im doing it in a bad but fast wayp  ol liget the codeobjectcodeli lihave a list of const in the form of codeKEYXXXXcode where codexxxxcode is the name of the key and the value is the string that will be the actual key in the codejsoncode object.li liuse the key like in the following example codebase.putKEYFROMDATE, hotelSearchData.getFromDatecodeli lifor ArrayList arrays I use codeJSONArraycode naturally, each codecode in codejsoncode is a bean object as far as Im concerned and  I need to create a bean for it.li ol  pThe problem is that this way, for future development is not so good for the very least... Every new request requires me new beans that some of them may have the same information inside them causing information and code duplicity.p  pEvery new request requires me to create new emKEY finalsem copying sometimes from other request with similar keys  idiotic p  pfor the first item, except for optimizing what Im about to do and dividing shared code beans to smaller items i can extend later on i cant see any elegant solution.p  pBut for the requestsresponse I thought of something but Im not so sure how elegant it is... I know emGoogleem have a different json library that uses reflection to codeserializedeserializecode codeJSONObjectcodes. I thought of using emannotationsem and reflection to do the codeserializationcode and codedeserializationcode, the codeannotationcodes should help in the cases where the member name is strongNOTstrong the same as the json key for the members value. also for codeArrayListltgtcode that its type is not saved in byte code and so does not exist after compilation, so you can either specify basic type or full package name.p  pIn this way once I create the bean with the help of some codeannotationscode maybe codepythoncode script ant script to automate part of it  I can make beans that if tomorrow I move to codexmlcode or something else codebinarycode I can just create different codeserializercode, codedeserializercode and be done with it.p  pI hoped to hear your opinion on it, or some other solutions, get some inspiration, Im really disappointed with my current code... p

Negative 5382 pI am new to styling html elements e.g. input amp select in this case, and I am looking to implement a visually combined input  select element.  In essence the input and select would still be completely separate as form elements, but based on class and css I would like to inset the contents of the select menu into the right hand side of the input field.  Sorry I am no photoshoper, so here is a representation of what it might look likep  precode                                 Select text [v]    codepre  pAs you can see the left hand portion of the input is where you would type the string for the input element, and the select drop down is inset into the border of the input element the [v] is supposed to be a down arrow button to drop the list.  Any links to how to get stared styling something like this or suggestions are welcome.p
Negative 5382 pIn my first rails project using mysql I tried to execute the coderake dbcreatecode command, but it outputted the following errorp  blockquote   pCould not find a JavaScript runtime.

Negative 5382 pIm trying to move a database from one SQL Server database running on one machine to a another machine that is the test server and copy of the original.p  pOn the main  machine, I took a backup of database myDB. On the test machine, I deleted the existing older database myDB. On the test machine, I restored the new database myDB.p  pThe data seems to have come across successfully. But I have a problem accessing the database. The owner of all tables is user1 and user1 exists with the same login on both DBs.p  pAfter trying to access the restored database on the test machine though as user1 there are problems. First it says that the password for user1 isnt correct. After resetting the password, it says the user1 doesnt have a default database set.  But it is set already to myDB.  It is the same name as the restored db  myDB.p  pWhat have I done wrong in restoring the DB Do I need to have deleted in addition to the DB the user user1 before attempting to restore the backup  I tried that.  How do I handle updating a restore and maintaining user accessp

Negative 5382 pOkay, Im creating a RingoJS project and hosting it on Google App Engine. Now App Engine allows you to use codejava.io.FileInputStreamcode to read data from the filesystem, but it doesnt allow you to use codejava.io.FileOutputStreamcode to write data to the filesystem.p  pThe data I would like to store is simple markdown for blog posts. Now Im trying to learn how to store data using the High Replication Datastore API provided by App Engine, but Im still confused as to how to do so.p  pIf Im not wrong, I need to do something along the following lines in JavaScriptp  precode Get the High Replication Datastore API importPackagecom.google.appengine.api.datastore   Create a new datastore var datastore  DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService   Save the blog post var blogPost  new EntityBlogPost, uid, author.getKey blogPost.setPropertymarkdown, markdown datastore.putblogPost   Create the key for the blog post var key  KeyFactory.createKeyBlogPost, uid, author.getKey   Getting the entity var blogPost  datastore.getkey   Reading the properties var markdown  blogPost.getPropertymarkdown codepre  pIs what Im doing correct Is there any other way to store persistent data easily I only need to read and write data.

Negative 5382 pI am processing records by pushing each record through validation stages, then into a database. One of the validation steps requires checking if certain columns are dates. I did this using DateTime.TryParses, out DateTime assuming that this would use the configured Regional Settings on the machine on which the process was running. On my local machine, this is a wrapper class running within a commandline harness from Visual Studio for ease of debugging. So 13012010 gets formatted as 13 January 2010 as per the enGB setting on my Windows 7 dev machine.p  pOn pushing this onto our test server, a Windows Server 2008 R2, this wrapper class runs within a Window Service under the LocalSystem account. Exactly the same code, Ive designed it such that the service is just a thin wrapper. However, after many cycles of debugging, it seems the server is parsing 13012010 as enUS and therefore failing. This is despite the Regional Settings being set to enGB. See screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comieH0I.png altRegional Settings on serverp  pNote that this is way before it gets to SQL Server so that is not part of this issue.p  pAfter fighting with this, Ive forced the situation by using the code below and setting the required format to enGB.p  precodeCulture  CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCultureenGB DateTimeStyles dateTimeStyles  DateTimeStyles.None DateTime dt bool pass  DateTime.TryParses,Culture,dateTimeStyles, out dt codepre  pThis now works.

Negative 5382 pI see that the event handlers registered through code.oncode are held in code.cachecode. I also see that the event handlers are also held in codeelem.datacode.p  pThe objects held in code.cachecode refer to the DOM nodes on which the events are registered. This leads to memory leak when the DOM nodes are detached, and this makes code.offcode calls mandatory.p  pI have a situation where I dont know when the DOM node to which I attached the event handler is being detached.

Is there a more efficient way.p  pI may even be completely wrong with my current use of the struct  What I have is a price feed of bidask prices.  I try to maintain a collection of M1, M5, M15 and H1 candle sticks i.e. OHLC data.  Typically I only require 100 hrs worth of data.  As a new minute of prices comes in, I can delete the oldest minute thus maintaining 100 hrs worth of data at any time.  As the H1, M15, M5, M1 can all be created from the base data of timestamped askbid prices, do I still need to hold independent H1, M15 etc for performance reasons.  I ask this because it is a duplication of datap  pEDIT  My current method is fine for my usual purpose but now I am backtesting, Im throwing millions of bidask prices at my code and need it to be as efficient as possible.  The back tests can currently take hours to performp  pI return from my collection of structs as followsp  precodestdvectorltdoublegt SeriesEODSeriesopen constiterator iter, unsigned long num  const    vectorltdoublegt v    if iter  end      return v     reverse iterator init skips the first element in collection.

Negative 5382 pSorry if I overlooked a potential answer to my question, but Im having trouble with using the UITapGestureRecognizer with a UILabel inside a subview UIViewController class...p  pBasically, Ive created a custom UIViewController that has a UILabel and a few other irrelevant elements. This custom UIViewController, however, is inside a custom UIScrollView with paging enabled and the labels are offset just enough so you can see the next UIViewControllers label. What I want to do is when the user touches the next label, the scrollRectToVisibleanimated method fires, essentially switching pages without scrolling. The CustomViewControllers UILabels are situated on the top.p  pHeres an example code for the container UIScrollView when adding the UITapGestureRecognizer to the CustomViewControllers UILabelp  precode[scrollView addSubviewCustomViewController]   void addSubview CustomViewController  view       create views frame here...

I think what I need is to access the CustomViewControllers frame and set the scrollRectToVisible to that, but Im not sure anymore...p  pIve tried this post but Im very new at ObjectiveC and I dont fully understand the hitTestwithEvent Im assuming the hitTestCGPoint has something to do with the views boundsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6631023iosuitapgesturerecognizerinitwithtargetactionmethodtotakeargumentsiOS  UITapGestureRecognizer initWithTargetaction method to take argumentsap  pIf anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great.

Negative 5382 pI currently have an app that is using a twitter bootstrap modal box. The div that the modal is displaying is getting loaded with JQuery from usersnew action. Everything works great if the user enters valid data in the modal box submitted but if the data sent to params does not pass validation the controller redirects back to the new action but this time outside of the modal box and the page that user was previously on is gone, which sort of defeats the purpose of having the modal box to begin with.p  pI have looked at LiveValidation and other javascript based clientside validations. These are an option but I would much prefer being able to use my existing validations in the users model for consistencys sake. I there a good way to make the modal box persist while the form is being submitted and to make the controller reload the page within the modal with the errormessagesp  pThanksp

Negative 5382 pI have a couple virtual directories in IIS 7.5 that point to network resources. Specifically, these folders hold PDF files. Ive granted a user permission to these folders, and their contents are accessible via web requests as I would expect. For example, codehttpmysitedir1test.pdfcode works perfectly for both virtual directories. However, when I try to expand one of the virtual directories the other works fine to see sub folders, IIS Manager becomes unresponsive almost immediately. p  pIm attempting to list the file names of all PDFs in virtual directory on a classic ASP page. p  precodeSet objFSO  Server.CreateObjectScripting.FileSystemObject filepath  Server.MapPathresourcesmyfolder Set folder  objFSO.GetFolderfilepath For Each file in folder.Files     If file.Type  PDF File Then         Response.Writeltpgt amp file.Name amp ltpgt     End If End If  Set folder  Nothing Set objFSO  Nothing codepre  pOn a separate page, I using identical code to list the contents of another virtual directory. However, this other directory as with IIS Manager causes problems by not responding. It causes the entire site to become unresponsive and I have to recycle to app pool to get it to come back. p  pThe effective permissions for the user account used to access these resources are identical. All files are accessible, and Ive confirmed they exist via hardcoding codefso.FileExistsfilepath amp filenamecode. Ive also confirmed that the folder object exists and its properties are being set. Even the codefolder.Files.Countcode is set properly in both cases. The issue is that the call to iterate through codefolder.Filescode causes the unresponsive behavior. Are there file size andor folder size limitations The only difference I see between the two directories is the number of files and consequently the size of the folder. The one that doesnt work is just over 1GB.p

Negative 5382 pI know this question is probably going to get alot of Duplicate question comments but i have yet to see one with an answer that works or isnt simply Avoid it at all cost. But here goes, i have created a control lets call it ControlA in a project called ControlAProject and i was intending to override some of its virtual methods in a control called ControlB that inherites ControlA in another project called ControlBProject . The idea being that ControlA has save and load methods that i wish to change from saving and loading to file, too saving and loading to database  and if later on another save and load type is required i can just override those methods again .  The problem i have is i originally had ControlA as a usercontrol and when i tried adding the new control with the overrides ControlB into a window i would get this errorp  pThe component ControlBProject.ControlB does not have a resource identified by the URI ControlAProjectcomponentusercontrolsControlA.xaml.p  pGoogling the error i came to the conclusion you could not inherit from a user control  or for the sake of arguement it wasnt a good idea . So i then changed the control from a user control to a custom control. this however then leads me to another problem, a template for a control doesnt link to the code behind i.e OnClick like it does in a user control and there is no easy way to simply override the behavier as far as i am aware. I know i can retemplate ControlB by copy and pasting ControlAs template and changing a few lines but controlA has a large template as it is and making mutliple copies seems a waste of space.  So put simply is there a correct way to change the behavier of a control in wpfp

Im hoping to have the background color of the cell in which that attribute is displayed to be conditionally colored like you can do in excel.p  pThe basic idea of excel conditional formatting is it figures out the range youre dealing with 0100, and when you assign one color to each extreme, it automatically figures out what the colors of the in between items should be.

Negative 5382 pI couldnt think of a better way to phrase this question, so let me clarifyp  pIm storing many things in Core Data, some of which are images stored as binary data.  These images have been set to allow for external storage, meaning, from what I can gather, that Core Data takes care of storing these pictures elsewhere on disk rather than inside the database itself if they are too large  1MB. I am also trying to build a simple backuprestore system for this database using File Sharing  clicking backup copies my .sqlite file from my Library folder to my Documents folder under a different name, allowing the user access through iTunes to store wherever they please, and clicking restore looks for a backup file in the Documents folder, deletes the active .sqlite file in the Library folder and replaces it with the backup.  p  pThe problem arises when an image is deleted from Core Data, but then I want to restore my database to a time when that image still existed.  When I delete that image using Core Data, I presume both the path to the image that is stored in the database and the image itself stored elsewhere are both deleted.  But, when I restore my old database by bringing the .sqlite file back, only the path to the image exists  the image itself was stored externally, so its nowhere to be found.p  pFirst of all, is this a reasonable approach to backing up and restoring a database under Core Data, or is there a clear reason that I shouldnt be going about it by copying the underlying .sqlite file back and forth  Second, can anyone provide advice on how I might go about allowing Core Data to take care of external storage while still having a way to back up those images  I realize that I could probably store images manually, thus allowing me to back up an image folder along with my .sqlite file, but I do like the simplicity of having Core Data manage this for me, so Im just wondering if there is any better way to do this backuprestore thing.p

Negative 5382 pI am currently working on a script that processes and combines several different files, and for the one part, it is necessary that I find the difference between two different times in order to determine a total amount of time that someone has worked. the times themselves are in the following formatp  precode 341800,402600,060800 codepre  pwith the first one being start time, second end time, third total time.

Negative 5382 pThis question is a hybrid one, being both technical and system design related. Im developing the backend of an application that will handle approx. 4K request per second.p  pWe are using bNode.jsb being super fast and in terms of our database struction we are using bMongoDBb, with bRedisb being a layer between Node and MongoDB handling bvolatileb operations.p  pIm quite stressed because we are expecting concurrent requests that we need to handle carefully and we are quite close to launch. However I do not believe Ive applied the correct approach on redis.p  pI have a class bStudentb, and they constantly change stagessuch as bactiveb, bdoing homeworkb,bin lessonb etc. Thus I created a Redis DB for each state. b1b for being active, b2b for being doing homework.

Ive been also suggested that in fact I used never use keys in production mode.p  pMy question is, no matter how conceptual it is, bwhat specific things I should avoidb doing in Node  Redis in bproduction stageb. Are they any issues related to my design Students bmustb be objects and I sure can list them in a list but I havent done yet. Is it bthatb crucial in production stagep

Negative 5382 pWe currently do not use any kind of version control software.  We recently started using Eclipse, and our source code is maintained on a network drive.  An Eclipse project was created and everyone has imported the project into Eclipse on their machines.  Due to the way we are set up, we are always getting stuck in cleanbuild loops throughout the day which is hurting productivity.p  pWe would like to start using some kind of VCS most likely GIT.  I am envisioning a centralized workflow with each developer having a local copy of the code on hisher machine.  We would rather use GitHub Enterprise for the shared repository instead of hosting the code on GitHub.  p  pI am not quite sure where to start in getting this setup correctly.  I have been watching videos and reading tutorials, however none seem to directly apply to how we would like to do things.  Is GIT the right software to use for the type of setup we desire  Also, how does cleanbuilding work with Eclipse and the local copies vs the shared repositoryp

Negative 5382 pI wrote a sophisticated algorithm to make a 3Dwheel with rotating panels.

This happens because the classes are sometimes placed in the wrong order, and I cant figure out how to change the order.p  pIf I follow one panel to see what happens to its classes this is what I see.p  precodeclass vrotLift vrotFront  zindex 3 amp zindex NULLltbr gt class vrotFront           zindex NULLltbr gt class vrotRearBottom      zindex 2ltbr gt class vrotRearHidden      zindex 1ltbr gt class vrotRearTop         zindex 1 ltbrgt class vrotRearTop vrotLift  zindex 1 amp zindex 3 ltbrgt  this is where the bug occurs ltbrgt class vrotLift vrotFront zindex 3 ampamp zindex NULL ltbrgt  codepre  pIt looks fine on paper. Yet notice that in the last step the classes are in the wrong order. This shouldnt be a problem, but it is.p  pBecause Im using a jQueryanimation, Im using switchClass instead of ToggleClass to animate from vrotRearTop to vrotFront. Exactly when this happens the panel blinks.p  pI think while its switching from rearTop zindex1 to FrontNULL somehow the zindex is removed just for a milisecond and then acquired again. The bug doesnt occur every time,strangely enough. 80 of the time there is no bug.p  pA solution Im thinking of is If somehow I can force the switchClass which does Remove, than add , to add the new class in front the existing class rather than behind, it would not blink. But is there a way to do so Can I force the new class to be added at a specific index in the classp  pI tried switching vrotRearTop vrotLift to vrotFront vrotLift but that somehow doesnt do the job. Because this way both classes are removed for a moment during the proces, making the blink occur every time.p  pIve tried countless workarounds, and all of them appear to ruin the animations. Im positive that if I can force the correct order of classes the bug is solved.p

Negative 5382 pIm attempting to build a four page website on the faces of a cube. Ive gotten pretty close to what I was after a hrefhttpscottdlowe.com relnofollowherea, but the 3D rotations sometimes dont behave as expected.p  pWhen a nav element is clicked, the y rotation to the correct face is set along with a random 360 about the x and z axes for a cool transition effect. The problem is that when the cube is rotated 90 or 270 degrees by clicking thoughts or contact, further z rotations arent working. In fact, Im pretty sure that in this state rotated 90 or 270 deg both rotateX and rotateZ properties are being applied about the xaxis because sometimes when on thoughts, clicking thoughts again causes the cube to rotate twice about x or not at all, even though each click should only incrementdecrement the x or z angles by 360 degrees. To observe this, click thoughts repeatedly to see the cube elements rotateX and rotateY styles correctly update in Developer Tools while the cube spins only about the xaxis. Ive observed this in both Chrome and Firefox.p  pHeres the code Im using to rotate the cube on nav clicksp  precode    function performNavigationpageName         generate random spins for x and z         ifMath.random gt .5             zAngle  360          else              zAngle  360                  ifMath.random gt .5             xAngle  360          else              xAngle  360                  navToDegreesMap is an array that stores the correct rotation angle for each face of the cube         yAngle  navToDegreesMap[pageName]         rotateCubexAngle,yAngle,zAngle           function rotateCubexAngle, yAngle, zAngle         prop is the transform property with appropriate vendor prefix         document.getElementByIdcube.style[prop]  rotateXxAngledeg rotateYyAngledeg rotateZzAngledeg      codepre  pThe source is a hrefhttpsgithub.comlowe0292scottdlowe.com relnofollowherea.p  pThank you for your helpp

But I dont think it is the right way to do it Coding preferably in C or Java  p  pI would also like to know another thing.

For APRnative, the default is 8192.   Note that for APRnative on Windows, the configured value will be reduced to the highest multiple of 1024 that is less than or equal to maxConnections.

The flicker is most certainly related to having a translucent window.  I also noticed that the flicker becomes worse as the window is enlarged.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong The line codethis.surface.setOpaquefalsecode is what is causing the problem.  If this is commented out, the animation does not flicker and there is translucency.  emHowever, upon each iteration of the animation it blends with the previous paintem its not clearing the contents before repainting.  Doing codeg2d.setBackgroundnew Color0, 0, 0, 0code and codeg2d.clearRect0, 0, getWidth, getHeightcode does nothing unless codethis.surface.setOpaquefalsecode is set.  Its almost like this line disables double buffering on linux.p  pemHaving a translucent window strongisstrong a requirement.emp

Negative 5382 pThere are plenty bufferlocal variables that triggers editors features. Showing lines and columns in modeline, activating linummode, and much more from various extensions, such as highlightline or fillcolumnhighlight. Some may be configured from options menu entry, some are showed as minor modes only if they are enabled, but most often they are triggered via codeMxcode commands.p  pIts pain to remember all commands for different needs. Id like to call for a temporary buffer like codecustomizegroupcode  that holds all available options and allows me to trigger them only for current buffer. I understand that various emacs extensions dont support this and Im ready to configure list of triggers and associate commands by hand.p  pWhat tools are available to make such customization easierp

Im using tables in order to get the sizing to stretch properly in both directions, but bonus points to anyone who can make this stretch properly without the use of tables.p  pI have boiled down the problem to a minimal example here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netyh7YD4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netyh7YD4ap  pHeres the HTMLp  precodeltdiv classoutergt     lttable border1gt         lttr classfirstrowgt             lttd classtolabelgtTolttdgt             lttd classinputwrappergt                 lttextareagtlttextareagt             lttdgt         lttrgt         lttr classresultsrowgt             lttd colspan2 classresultswrappergt                 ltdiv classresultsgt                     ltulgt                         ltligtoneltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                         ltligttwoltligt                     ltulgt                 ltdivgt             lttdgt         lttrgt     lttablegt ltdivgt codepre  pwith this CSSp  precode.outer      position absolute     top 50px     left 50px     right 50px     bottom50px  .firstrow      height10px  .resultswrapper      positionrelative  table      width 100     height100  .results      positionabsolute     top 0px     left 0px     right 0px     bottom 0px     overflowy scroll  codepre

Negative 5382 pGood morning everyone,p  pI am sending data to a device from android each 40ms. Up until now, I have been using a whiletrue thread and thread.sleep because I didnt know better . Now I see I have a lot of better options likep  pTimerTaskp  pAsynctaskp  pScheduledThreadPoolExecutorp  pWhich is the best one for my scenario Keep in mind that there may be an exception thrown if the device disconnects so I will need to stop sending values until the connection is restored. Furthermore, the data must be sent at pretty precise intervals and it should, in no case, be sent less than 40ms before the previous one.p  pThanksp

Negative 5382 pI am developing a website on a local test environment. From time to time I need to import classes or functions into my php pages.

Negative 5382 pIm writing an Ntier application that uses NHibernate and a Repository pattern to interface with a SQL store. Because the project is NTier, the NHibernate entities are mapped to the domain model who are then mapped to view models, and vice versa, causing models to be disconnected between NHB sessions. p  pThe problem I have is that when I attempt to save a changed entity an entity that has been recently instantiated to represent an old, changed entity from a previous session using the Merge method, I get an exception about violating a unique index on my table because NHB is trying to insert instead of update a row with the same ID as the entity. Ive double checked my mappings, and that my entity contains all the right values in all the right places... it would seem NHB is not checking if a row exists before trying to insert, thoughtsp

Negative 5382 pIm playing with some basic haskell network stuff but there is a problem which drives me nuts. The following quite simple server code seems to leak memory and I just dont know why.p  pFirst I fork the acceptmethod and just echo all incoming messages. Ive tested the server with the Apache Benchmark Tool ab. But after a few tests using ab the server  process starts to leak memory, not much but continuously.

Another test I did was using handlebased IO, which didnt caused the memory to grow over 3 MB in total.p  pUsing lazy IO ByteString.Lazy caused the same problem but even faster.

However, I am now confronted with a situation which makes it seem like WPF also looks at the declared property type for some reason.p  pThis is an exemplary view modelp  precodeusing System using System.Windows.Input  public class SimpleViewModel      private class MyExampleCommand  ICommand              public bool CanExecuteobject parameter                      return true                   public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged          public void Executeobject parameter                            public override string ToString                      return test                    private ICommand exampleCommand      public ICommand ExampleCommand              get                      if exampleCommand  null                              exampleCommand  new MyExampleCommand                          return exampleCommand                codepre  pUse an instance of that class as a data context in a window and add this buttonp  precodeltButtongt     ltTextBlock TextBinding ExampleCommandgt ltButtongt codepre  pIn the running application, the button will be empty. If codeSimpleViewModel.ExampleCommandcode is typed to codeobjectcode instead of codeICommandcode, codetestcode will be shown as the label on the button as expected.p  pstrongWhat is wrong here Does WPF really treat objects differently based on the emdeclaredem type of the property that returned them Can this be worked around, and are any other types beside codeICommandcode affectedstrongp

The codeimgcode has codeposition relativecode and codezindez 9999999code.

Negative 5382 pI have an annoying problem. I am building a simple social network which has a Member model. I use Devise for authentication and CanCan for authorization.

Negative 5382 pGiven all three functions, this call is ambiguous.p  precodeint f int  int f int ampamp  int f int const amp   int q  f 3  codepre  pRemoving codef int code causes both Clang and GCC to prefer the rvalue reference over the lvalue reference. But instead removing either reference overload results in ambiguity with codef int code.p  pOverload resolution is usually done in terms of a strict partial ordering, but codeintcode seems to be equivalent to two things which are not equivalent to each other. What are the rules here I seem to recall a defect report about this.p  pIs there any chance codeint ampampcode may be preferred over codeintcode in a future standard The reference must bind to an initializer, whereas the object type is not so constrained. So overloading between codeTcode and codeT ampampcode could effectively mean use the existing object if Ive been given ownership, otherwise make a copy. This is similar to pure passbyvalue, but saves the overhead of moving. As these compilers currently work, this must be done by overloading codeT const ampcode and codeT ampampcode, and explicitly copying. But Im not even sure even that is strictly standard.p

I can see the scrollHeight of the element I am trying to set but the scrollTop value never changes from zero. The only possible difference from a standard application of setting scrollTop and my configuration is that I am attempting to set the scrollTop of an element in a child frame. I can access the element fine via selectors through the child frame and then I can see the scrollHeight as a correct value.

Now coming to the Problem,if what I found is true then when I change the play.pool  5 manually in the strongapplication.confstrong does not gives me a faster result neither if i set play.pool1 and run in production mode also doesnot slows down my application loadtest results, So I need to know what happens when I change from dev to prod mode, other than this play.pool which makes my application faster. because I am facing problem In UAT where no good results for changing in prod mode also, it only works in my localhost.please find me a solution sooner thanks in Advance.p  pUPDATE  p  pYes I do know all those stuffs like in DEV mode the application reloads and compiles but, perhaps its not for each and every request only at the initial program loading i think , but my Problem is strongthis prod mode working fine at my localhost and my local server, when I go for UAT clients Testing server which is at America I get a bad results at load test around 800msstrong as average. the application is slow even in prod even I am performing the loadtest locallythe jmeter is installed in the server machine and I am loadtesting it using Remote Desktop Connection.

I found that when I double click the header, the exception is the same as above, and also shows the selected headers information as I coded. I guess the exception is because the tables header has sorting listener. I tried to setAutoCreateRowSorterfalse and also summaryHeader.setReorderingAllowedfalse but it still doesnt work. The relevant new code is as followsp  precode  public JTableSummary      super     setAutoCreateRowSorterfalse     JTableHeader summaryHeader  this.getTableHeader     summaryHeader.setReorderingAllowedfalse     summaryHeader.addMouseListenernew MouseAdapter            Override         public void mouseClickedMouseEvent e              if e.getClickCount2                    int index  convertColumnIndexToModelcolumnAtPointe.getPoint                    if index gt 0                        System.out.printlnClicked on column   index                                                          codepre  pI suppose the current problem is how to effectively disable header sorting listenerI can see sorting icon  a triangle appeared upwarddownward when I click the header and to make my own listener workablep  pThanks in advance for your helpp

Supporting union operation in O1 time Suppose weve two Sets S1 and S2.p  precode   PSEUDOCODE             node UnionSet S1,Set S2                   S1.tailgtnext  S2.head                   S1.tail  S2.tail                   Remove S2 from the list of sets                   return S1              codepre  pis my approach going in right direction p
Negative 5382 pIn the old XIB world of iOS development, I was able to create one View Controller and one XIB, and use them for both the iPhone and iPad environments.

Negative 5382 pI have the following drupal configuration Drupal 7.23, using the Domain Access module a hrefhttpsdrupal.orgprojectdomain relnofollowhttpsdrupal.orgprojectdomaina, Varnish. I have 4 domains using the same drupal install, but each domain has its own subtheme Omega theme 3.x. Everything works fine the problem is that the page load for the last domain is higher then the other ones. I noticed that the theme 4 is not showing up on the cache table. The other ones show up. It seems that drupal is not caching that particular theme, so it has to load the theme from scratch every time.

I was wondering how I would go about defining user defined operators to do such an action.p  pCurrently I have, within the type definition for Particle, the following linesp  precodeprocedure, public addNewParticleTo generic operator.spawn. gt addNewParticleTo codepre  pFollowing which, I have a subroutine that is defined as followsp  precodesubroutine addNewParticleToaLHS, aRHS   implicit none   classParticle, dimension, allocatable, intentin aLHS   classParticle, dimension, allocatable, intentinout aRHS   ltrest of the codegt end subroutine addNewParticleTo codepre  pI intend for the operator to be invoked asp  precodeparticle .spawn. particleArray codepre  pI was wondering if this is the correct way to go about doing this. Any suggestions or advise on this will be very helpful.p
Negative 5382 pI wonder if its possible to assign a dynamic color in storyboard.p  pSince iOS7 you can use a tintColor and change it programmatically via the tintColor of the keyWindow. But I cant find a way to affect this tintColor to a button background for example. Which could allow me to easily have a way to theme my application.p  pI thought of a crazy hack by using a category on UIColor and overloading the initializer to swap a specific color and use this color when ever I want a dynamic color.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 5382 pI have a website that I would like to be able to also play in mobiles. p  pIn the interface I mostly use javascript. How can I detect the moves of the users fingers on the screen , so I can call the right javascript functionsp  pFor example , in my photogallery I have codeltinput typebutton onClickimagenextgtcode to call the codeimagenextcode, so the gallery renders the next image.p  pIn case of mobile phones, how can I do something like codeonFingerMovedimagenextcodep  pOr even better, how can I add the move events to my already existing code Like codeonClick or onMove functioncodep  pAnd of course I am looking for crossmobile browser solutionsp  pForgive my childish examples, I am a begginerp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5382 pI am in windows. I use Mercurial hg. I made a clone of a project hg clone then hg pull another project hg pull. So mercurial asks me to do a merge of the two projects. And then there is a conflict between the two projects. And now I know what to do because kdiff3 does not open automatically so that I can resolve the conflict.p  pSo if someone had an idea of how I could make kdiff3 opens automatically when mercurial encounter conflict.p  pThank you very much and good day.p

I feel that the code is really windy and very redundant. p  pstrongMy questions arestrongp  p1 Is it fine to have multiple SELECT queries to SQL in 1 file itself or having too many separate queries in 1 file can overload the serverp  p2 In the above code, I open sql connection and close it for each queries. Does that affect the performance if I connect to sql so many times and run separate queries in the same filep  p3 Can someone give an example on how I can maybe simply that code for efficiency so I can understand the right way of doing it pleasep
Negative 5382 pI am using Visual Studio 2012 MSTest framework with Silk4NET plug in. Every time when a test case finishes running, the Application Under Test is killed. This is REALLY annoying because this makes inspection harder in that I have to rerun the test and have to manually stop the test code to investigate the issue. Does anybody know if I can disable this feature in VS where it kills everything after test execution Thank youp

The edmx diagram is inside the repository.EF project.p  pThe common.model project will have base entities that both the modules poco entities will inherit from. The problem I have in my edmx diagram is that I need to use multiple namespaces. Module1.Model and Common.Model. Plus I have also separated out the entities within both projects into different folders which means I have to use x number of different namespaces.p  pThe current edmx diagram only has one namespace textbox but I need to use several. Is there a way using the xml part or by code first to map the entities from different namespacesp  pIm sure other people must have run into this problem before. Otherwise I will have to remove the common.model project and have the same entities in each module which means duplicating everything.p

So the first row means that one player on Alabama for 20122013 averaged 2.5 points that year.  The data frame is much longer than this, with more teams and the years continuing through 19971998.  I want to know how to find out how many players averaged between 04, 4.19, 9.114, and 14.1 for each year per school.  In other words for 20122013, how many players averaged in those 4 categories for Alabama.  But I would need those numbers for each year for Alabama and the other schools involved.   I think some form of an apply function should be used but Im not sure.p

Negative 5382 pi want to make a text based rpg game, but ive run into a problem, im fairly new to c, know a few concepts but still learning. So what i want to know is how do i open a file and edit the values in it say i have a file called health, for my characters health and its set to 100. I know you can just subtract the variable by the damage you set the monsters to do, but i dont know how i store the health and edit it, while my program goes along.p  pie. this is the farthest i gotp  precodeifstream objectFilehealth.txt string health double NoH  cout ltlt welcome ltlt endl objectFile gtgt health gtgt NoH cout ltlt health ltlt   ltlt NoH  15 codepre  pNoH  Number of health. So far all my program does, is read the file, and subtract 15 from 100 because thats the damage the monster do. But how do i make it take out the value and subtract 15 from it then store it back so its 85, and next time i get hit its 65 for example etc, so it makes it the objective of the game is about surviving, ie avoiding getting hit and stuff. i mean avoiding your hp to reach 0, but also i want to learn how to implement simple text based creatures you can kill, by letting their hp reach 0. thanksp

Negative 5382 pI am in process on integrating SSO on multitenant website. We are using ACS as RPSTS and there are multiple 3rd party IDPs in our topology.p  pBased on tenant configuration we change the coderealmcode and codehomerealmcode parameter in signin request for correct redirection and eliminating IDP selection page on ACS. Rule groups are set on ACS to transform input claims from corresponding IDP to correct app specific output claims. So far we have nailed down all basic requirements but one.p  pSome of our tenants want their website user to redirect to their IDP for login while some of them dont want redirection to IDP for login. I dont know how I can tell ACS not to redirect to IDP for login.p  pIn my application, I am using the codeHttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticatedcode property to verify LoggedIn user.p  pFor example, if user is logged in GMAIL and we are using Google as one of our IDP. First time when user access our website in new tab of the same browser, we get codeIsAuthenticatedcode as false in our webapp and user is redirected to ACS. But ACS finds user logged in to GMAIL and redirects user back to our website with translated claims. But if user is not logged in GMAIL, in this case ACS redirects user to Google for login. Once user logs in Google, he gets redirected to our website with translated claims.p  pSo I still want ACS to handle heavy lifting work of token creation, parsing and claim transformation if user is logged in but in case if user is not logged simply redirect user back to website with some status. p  pIs this really possible Is there any specific action wa I should be using instead of codewawsignin1.0codep  pUPDATE If I have to stop redirection, is there anyway I can process SignInRequestMessage on RelyingPartywebapp it self Presently I prepare SignInRequestMessage based on tenant and WriteQuerystring out to RedirectResult, which performs GET request on ACS and to Google eventually. Instead if I can POST SignInRequestMessage in application itself and parse the response Is this possiblep

The goal is that by varying the sign and magnitude of codewcode I can smoothly vary the magnitude and polarity of the modulation of the background by the checkerboard texture.p  pTo give you a graphical examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn1kQo.png altenter image description herep  pUsing codeglBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA,GLONEMINUSSRCALPHAcode and just varying the alpha value of my overlay wont quite do what I want, because I cant use negative alpha values to invert the polarity of my overlay.p  pIs there a way to do this type of linear additivesubtractive blending using the fixed pipeline, or failing that, would it be possible to implement this using a shaderp  h2Updateh2  pFor further clarification Ive added a crude PyOpenGL example of what Im trying to do a hrefhttpsgist.github.comalimuldal77b47f58109e6d2de35d relnofollowherea.p  h2Update 2h2  pTo be totally clear, if codew gt 0code, I want to emincreaseem the luminance of every pixel within a emwhiteem squares on my checkerboard, and emdecreaseem the luminance of every pixel within a emblackem square.

Negative 5382 pI have an application with a bunch of SVG elements.

This worked in all browsers for some time, but has stopped working in Chrome 35 and problem persists in 36 beta. It seems to be fixed in 37.  In Chrome, the GUI seems to be stuck  the hover and click actions work, but the color changes arent visible  the code is executed correctly, but it seems it is not rendered properly.p  pI have several insightsp  ol liThis happens for the first time I do that  when I navigate somewhere else in the application and go back it shows the SVGs again, it starts working.li liWhen I inspect the code in Dev tools, I see the element has the selected class and also, the element has the colored fill in CSS inspector  but it is not visible to the user. When I disable and enable any CSS rule in the CSS inspector, it starts working. I researched Chromes changelogs, but cant find anything relevant. It works fine in all other major browsers.li ol  pEDIT no matter the way I add the rule to the element, it wont render it until I reload the whole parent element, which I cannot do. The code seems to do exactly what I want internally, but Chrome just wont show the change. Is there some way to simulate the same action as Google dev tools css rule change  Which always fixes it for me p  pKind regards, Lukasp

Negative 5382 pI have a page that contains multiple iframes. All iframes reference the same page. Each iframe page contains a form that I want to submit to the server.

With the iframes document, itll proceed to fill in some form values for the form in the iframe page. The function will then grab the button of the form and click it. This calls off a function in the iframe that does some processing and submits the form.p  pIn chrome, all iframes forms are submitted. However, in firefox, the form submission will only happen for the first form. Ive went into the debugger and see that even though its looping through for all the iframe pages, only one submission actually happens. p  pAnyone have any ideasp  pThanks.p
Negative 5382 pMy company is currently using Grasshopper as our voice system for receiving and routing inbound customer support calls. Its working pretty well.p  pExcept that its 2014 and people expect to be able to text issues to our toll free customer support number and get responses.

Negative 5382 pWhat is the safest way to divide two IEEE 754 floating point numbersp  pIn my case the language is JavaScript, but I guess this isnt important. The goal is to avoid the normal a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE19957018063568ncggoldberg.html relnofollowfloating point pitfallsa.p  pIve read that one could use a correction factor cf e.g. 10 uplifted to some number, for instance 1010 like sop  precodea  cf  b  cf codepre  pBut Im not sure this makes a difference in divisionp  pstrongEditstrongp  pApparently people find this question so bad that they feel the need to downvote it. Maybe I should have mentioned that Ive already looked at the other floating point posts on StackOverflow and Ive still not found a single SO post on how to divide two floating point numbers. If the answer is that there is no difference between the solutions for working around floating point issues when adding and when dividing, then just answer that please. Otherwise please tell my why you downvoted this question to avoid me making this mistake in the future.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pIve been asked in the comments which pitfalls Im referring to, so I thought Id just add a quick note here as well for the people who dont read the commentsp  pWhen adding 0.1 and 0.2, you would expect to get 0.3, but with floating point arithmetic you get 0.30000000000000004 at least in JavaScript. This is just one example of a common pitfall.p  pThe above issue is discussed many times here on StackOverflow, but I dont know what can happen when dividing and if it differs from the pitfalls found when adding or multiplying. It might be that that there is no risks, in which case that would be a perfectly good answer.p
Negative 5382 pFinally, Ive decided to move my strongdissertation researchstrong closer toward the goal of making it as good strongreproducible researchstrong as it can be, given my circumstances. Since currently I dont use codeLaTeXcode for my dissertation report though Im considering this option, I believe that codeknitrcode is the best way to go.p  pThe software project, implementing empirical part of my dissertation research emdata analysisem, is being written in codeRcode. The projects contains multiple files within emdirectory structureem, which is rather typical for scientific workflows top level subdirectories codeanalysis, cache, data, figures, import, prepare, present, results, sandbox, utilscode.p  pI have read a lot of information including examples on using codeknitrcode for autogenerating reports and reproducible research, in general. However, Im somewhat overwhelmed by multitude of configuration options and, more importantly, still confused on the strongbestcorrectoptimal approachstrong for using codeknitrcode in projects like mine, containing strongmultiple files and directoriesstrong. In particular, Im interested in advice on framework and steps for strongtransitioningstrong emexisting codebaseem without too many modifications in codeRcode modules.p  pAs an strongexamplestrong, lets consider my modules, related to emexploratory data analysis EDAem. My current EDA workflow includesp  ul lippreliminary data, transformed from the original raw data located in datatransform subdirectoriespli lipmodule eda.R, located in analysis directorypli lipdirectory resultseda, where my current code is generating figures SVG files of univariate and multivariate EDA, as well as a single document report PDF file with the same graphical only information generated descriptive statistics is being produced as a console output, when running the eda.R script.pli ul  pIn order to transition to codeknitrcodebased project, I have created file edareport.Rmd with codeR Markdowncode statements for setting local codeknitrcode options, including codereadchunkeda.Rcode. My understanding is that now I need to define existing blocks of codeRcode code in eda.R as codeknitrcode emchunksem and then call these named chunks, according to my EDA workflow.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  pIs it correct approach What are best practices for using codeknitrcode in regard to setting up project paths, using codesourcecode, grouping some plots via codegridExtracode, preventing potential issues It seems to me that, in addition to edareport.Rmd, I need to create another R module, which will be initiating processing of the code.Rmdcode file by codeknitrcode. If Yes, which call should I use codermarkdownrendercode or codeknitrknitcode while I use codeRStudiocode for development, I want my code to be independent from the development environmentp  pstrongUPDATE 1 Additional questionstrongp  pWhy processing of an code.Rmdcode file in codeRStudiocode via Knit HTML button produces codeHTMLcode document, while processing via codeMakefilecode command codeRscript e libraryknitr knitedareport.Rmdcode produces code.mdcode file, but not codeHTMLcode, despite the presence of codeoutput htmldocumentcode directivep  pstrongThank you for reading this Your advice will be greatly appreciatedstrongp

Negative 5382 pForgive me for this being a fairly vague question on codeNSScrollViewcode classes. I am just not really understanding them, despite having read up on them a bunch.p  pI have a codeNSViewControllercode subclass which has a codexibcode. In this view I drop in an codeNSScrollViewcode. I connect an codeIBOutletcode from the view controller class.p  pThis is where I get confused.p  pWhat is the difference between the codeNSScrollViewcode codedocumentViewcode and codeclipViewcode When added inside the codexibcode the scrollview is given an codeNSClipViewcode. Whyp  pIf I want to add a subview to my scrollview inside the codexibcode, I can only drop a view into the codeNSClipViewcode of the codeNSScrollViewcode and not the scrollview directly. I also see, when I resize the codeNSClipViewcode so that itself, clips a subview I dropped in, scroll bars appear on the scrollview. However, when I run my app, I cant scroll. Secondly, the subviews dont appear when the app is running anyway.p  pIf someone could explain how an NSScrollView works, that would really help Everything I have read on it thus far hasnt made it click with me.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 5382 pSorry in advance if this is difficult to follow, Ill draw up diagrams if need be.p  pIm using Unity3D to develop a game and am having trouble with the players transform. The game is first person, 3D, and there are points where the gravity will change, allowing the player to walk along a wall  This is all up and running.p  pWhen the players gravity is such that it walks on a wall, when I rotate the characters to look around its transform behaves strangely. It can rotate through a full circle and there are no visible problems with the character when playing the game.p  pIf I look at the inspector in Play Mode, lets say Im continually turning right, the following happensp  ul lithe rotation increases up to 90 degreesli lias soon as it reaches 90 degrees, it begins to count in reverse back down towards 0, as though I have changed direction but I am still turning rightli liit then counts down past 0 and continues to 270  once it hits 270 it begins counting back up again, increasing back up to 90, and so on. The other axes change now and then, only by 0.00001 degree, but they stay around the value they should the same thing happens on the ground and that rotates fine, so I dont think this is the problem.li ul  pThe sequence would go something like code0, 1, 2 ... 88, 89, 90, 89, 88 ...1, 0, 359, ...271, 270, 271 ... 359, 0, 1 ...89, 90, 89 ...code etc.p  pWhen I watch the transform in the Scene view, it goes back and forth like a wiper on a car window, when but my character itself is just continually turning in one direction. When I am on the ground it makes full circles as it should, even though the value is still pingponging.p  pWhat causes this to happen It doesnt happen when the player character is on the floor, only when it is on walls. The reason I need to know is because there is something else in the game that relies on mimicking the players rotation, and this problem is giving me behaviour that I dont want.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, Id had trouble with this for a whilep

Negative 5382 pI have a django site which is going to display various matplotlib plots. I am able to create a matplotlib plot, convert it into a png and display it,...but only if all the logic is contained within the views.py file of the relevant app.p  pThis would be fine if I just needed a fairly basic page with a simple plot. However the problem is that the site as a whole is going to require several plots each involving their own python files, logic etc.p  pSo what ive done is created a new folder within the app that contains the python files for calculating the various plots. From within the view.py I was planning on just calling the relevant python file which would return the plot. By doing that, I could keep the logic around how the plots are created separate from the displaying of the page.p  pThe problem that ive run into is the following errorp  precodeQPixmap It is not safe to use pixmaps outside the GUI thread codepre  pAfter researching this error it is clearly and issue when you are trying to update the GUI from a different thread. However that is not what im trying to do. Im trying to create the plot outside of the views.py file, then pass it back and create the png to update the page. So the updating of the GUI shouldnt be happening in another threadp  pMy code in views.py isp  precodefig  plotLogic.getPlot this is a call to a separate file which returns the figure canvasFigureCanvasfig responsedjango.http.HttpResponsecontenttypeimagepng canvas.printpngresponse return response codepre  pIs there an alternative way to accomplish what im trying to do Essentially just keeping the logic of how the plot is created separate and returning the plot so that it can be converted to a png and displayed.p  pI feel like I am somehow making this more complicated than it should be. Im not intentionally trying to do anything fancy like updating the GUI in a separate thread. Many thanks.p

Negative 5382 pI have a task that is requiring me to set tree branch icons according to certain conditions.  To do this, I created a customer DefaultTreeCellRenderer.  What is happening is that only the leafs are getting rendered, not the branches.  Below is the code that I have implemented with some comments p  precodeprivate TreeIconCellRenderer extends DefaultTreeCellRenderer     public Component.getTreeCellRendererComponentJTree tree, Object value,boolean     selected, boolean expanded, boolean leaf, boolean row, boolean hasFocus     Get defaults in case there is no need to renderer     super.getTreeCellRendererComponenttree, value, selected, expanded, leaf, row, hasFocus      ifvalue instanceof DefaultMutableTreeNode         DefaultMutableTreeNode node  DefaultMutableTreeNodevalue          ifleaf              logger.debugThis node is not a leaf but a branch             This block of code never executes             ifcondition  node.getCondition                 setIconbranchImage1              else ifcondition2  node.getCondition                  setIconbranchImage2              else ifcondition3  node.getCondition                  setIconbranchImage3              else                  Use supers renderer                       else              logger.debugThis is a leaf node             This block always executes             ifleafCondition1  node.isLeafCondition                 setIconleafImage              else if leafCondition2  node.getLeafCondition                 setIconleafImage2              else                  Use supers renderer                       codepre  pp  pThe problem that I having is that it appears as though the renderer is always by passing the branches boolean leaf is always true.  I do not understand how that could happen.  Can anyone explain how the renderer would look past the branches and only alter the leaves  Thank you very much in advance.  I have been looking on the interenet for a week about this problem.  I know setOpenIcon will change the branches but, it will change the icon for every open branch.  I need each branch have different images depending on conditional statements.br  p
Negative 5382 pI have to write JavaScript code for a web page to display some data after fetching it from databaseusing phpmysql. I have two divs for results, one textfield for entering parameter and one button on your html page. Once clicked on the button, I need to call a ajax function which will ultimately make a request for php page on the server. The results will be passed to the client and will be used to dynamically change the contents of the divisions on the html page. You will populate one division with one type of data, other with the remaining data. I am looking to implement this using AJAX technology, PHP and DBMS.

Negative 5382 pIm building a view thats very similar to the messages app  I have a subview at the bottom of the page with a UITextView in it and as the user types and reaches the end of the line the text view as well as the view containing it should expand upward.p  pThe way I have it working is that in the codetextViewDidChangecode method I call my layout function, and that doesp  precodeCGFloat textViewWidth  200 CGFloat textViewHeight  [self.textView sizeThatFitsCGSizeMaketextViewWidth, 2000].height [self resizeParentWithTextViewSizeCGSizeMaketextViewWidth, textViewHeight]   And then the resize parent method eventually calls textView.frame  CGRectMake10, 10, textViewWidth, textViewHeight codepre  pThe problem is that when typing at the end of line and the view expands, I end up with an arbitrary codecontentOffset.ycode of something like 10.5 on the text view so the text is all shifted up to the top of the view. Weirdly, its alternating on every other line, so expanding the first time leaves the y content offset shifted up, then at the next line its close to zero, then back to 10.5 on the next line, etc.  not sure if thats helpful or just a strange artifact of my values. I can set it back to zero afterwards but it looks terrible because theres a brief flash where the text has the offset value and then it gets shifted back to the middle.p  pIve read that its usually better to use content insets for scroll views rather than changing the frame, but I dont get how to do that because I do need to change the frame size as well.p  pHow can I resize the UITextView without this happening I think I can get by with setting the text view not to be scrollable and that fixes the issue, but Id like to understand whats going on.p

Negative 5382 pI have codeVirtualboxcode v4.3.18 installed on my Mac X 10.10 and created a VM with codeUbuntucode on it ubuntu14.04.1desktopamd64.iso.

Negative 5382 pIve been researching the possibility of using a tool that collates errors from multiple logs from our application stack and present them in a consumable manner.  So it would tell us easily if error x happened y times, etc...  and maybe even report metrics in graph format.  The goal here is to capture errors easier and identify problem areas.p  pWe need the tool to be a local install and it would just ideally analyse log files we point it too.p  pAre there any free tools that do this kind of thingp  pMany Thanksp

Negative 5382 pSo, I have a number of UI classes I have created, which all extend another class codeControlBasecode. The codeControlBasecode class contains a getter and setter for an codeenabledcode property.p  pWhat I am aiming to achieve is that whenever a UI element, lets say a codeButtoncode class, is disabled, all mouse events stop.p  pI am awake of codemouseEnabledcode however, I sill want it to block any elements behind it, if that makes sense. So if I have a button on top of another button, the bottom button doesnt get activated when top button is disabledp  pCurrently, I have achieved this, but it feels like it may be rather inefficient. The way I am achieving it is by putting this code in the codeControlBasecode class constructorp  precode    this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.DOUBLECLICK, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEMOVE, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEOUT, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEOVER, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEWHEEL, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.ROLLOUT, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerMouseEvent.ROLLOVER, checkMouseEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYDOWN, checkKeyboardEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true     this.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYUP, checkKeyboardEvent, false, int.MAXVALUE, true codepre  pAnd then also puttingp  precodeprivate function checkMouseEventeMouseEventvoid              if enabled                  e.preventDefault                 e.stopImmediatePropagation                       private function checkKeyboardEventeKeyboardEventvoid              if enabled                  e.preventDefault                 e.stopImmediatePropagation                       codepre  pin the same class. So these events fire before any other event because they have the maximum allowed priority and then stop the propagation of the event if the control is disabled.p  pI do feel it may be inefficient though because of the large number of events that are now being listened for. Will this pose a problem when there are a large number of UI elements being used If so, does anyone have any ideas for a more memory efficient systemp  pThanks, Willp  pemEditem Maybe I should override the codeaddEventListenercode method on the codeControlBasecode class with somethin along the lines ofp  precodeoverride public function addEventListenertypeString, listenerFunction, useCaptureBooleanfalse, priorityint0, useWeakReferenceBooleanfalsevoid  super.addEventListenertype, functioneEvent  if enabled listenere , useCapture, priority, useWeakReference  codepre  pOr is this not a good way of going about thisp

My colorbar is vertical and to the right of my contour plot. I can put a lable on top of it but I am unable to put one down the length of it. Also does anyone know how to write superscript in matlab. Im trying to write U but when I use  the command line closes. Regards, Jerp  hr

Negative 5382 pIm trying to optimize a graphtraversal problem, but cant figure out the best way to tackle it. It seems neither like A search problem because we want to maximize the path rather than minimizing it, nor traveling salesman problem because we dont have to visit all cities. The simplified version of it is something along these linesp  pWe have a set of nodes and connectionsedges. Connections are arbitrary and nodes can have one or more of them. Connections also have an interfacetype associated with them, and interfaces cant support more than a single connection. So for example, if node codeAcode can connect to nodes codeBcode or codeCcode via interface codealphacode, and we decide to connect it to node codeBcode, that interface on node codeAcode can no longer support other connections, so codeCcode cant be connected to codeAcode anymore. However, we could connect node codeCcode to node codeDcode, if it happens to have the same codealphacode interface.p  pI should also mention that these interfaces work like lockandkey, so codeAcode can connect to either codeBcode or codeCcode, but codeBcode and codeCcode cant connect to eachother the interface is like a mirror. Also, while codeAcode can no longer connect to anything via the codealphacode interface because its used by codeBcode, if it happens to have another interface codebravocode and something else can connect to codebravocode, then we can connect more than one node to codeAcode. The goal is to obtain the largest group of connected nodes discarding all smaller groups.p  pThere are a few heuristics Im consideringp  ul liprefer nodes with more interfaces I already discarded interfaces without pairsli liprefer interfaces that are more popularli ul  pThe above two rules can be useful for prioritizing which node to try connecting to next for now I naively grouped them into one rank  total number of connectable nodes, but my gut is telling me I can do better. Moreover, I dont think this would favor an optimal solution.p  pI was trying to figure out if I can invert the heuristic somehow to create a variation of codeA Searchcode such that the A optimistic heuristic cost rule still applies i.e. heuristic cost  number of nodes discarded, however, this breaks the actual cost computation  since wed be starting with all but one node discarded.p  pAnother idea I had was computing the distance number of intermediate nodes to each node from the starting node and using the average of that as a heuristic, with goal being all nodes connected. However, Im not guaranteed that all nodes will connect.p  pstrongEDITstrong Here is an examplep  ul lidashed lines represent allowed but not activatedtraveled connectionsli liinterfaces are not allowed to connect to the interface with identical name, but can connect to the codecode version of itselfli liinterface can only be used once if we connect codeAcode to codeBcode via codecode, we can no longer connect codeAcode to codeCcode because codeAcode no longer has interface codecode availableli linumber of nodes is arbitrary but constant during the algorithms execution, and should be assumed to be very largeli linumber of interfaces per node is going to be at least one, we could assume an upper limit if it makes the problem easier  i.e. 3li linumber of possible connections is simply a function of interface compatibility, interface defines what the node can connect to, whetherhow you use that interface is up to youli lidirectionorder of activating the connections doesnt matterli lithe goal is to generate the largest set of connected nodes we dont care about number of connections or interfaces usedli ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkvJGt.png altExamplep

So far example, if I want a 8 by 16 grid, I divide the length of the rectangle by 6 and divide the width by 16 to get different sized squares. Finally I write a loop to calculate the density of each region of the Cartesian Grid. I can store the density of each region in a matrix.p  pIs there a Python module that allows me to do thisp

Negative 5382 pWhen building a regression model, we sometimes want to look at the weight or contribution of each variable in the model to the models final output. The way Im used to doing this is by looking at the absolute value of the zscore of each model variable.p  pThis seems to be backed up by the caret function varImp for variable importance in R, which reports the absolute value of zscores for each model variable in a glm model.

Negative 5382 pIm working on a library where many of our core objects are templates with one particular instantiation showing up in most of the files in the project in the form of a smart pointer to that template instantiation. I explicitly instantiate these templates in a single source file. We recently switched to C11 and Im trying to use the new p  precodeextern template class MyTemplateltdoublegt codepre  pto speed up the compilation. My first question is whether my use of smart pointers around p  precodeMyTemplateltdoublegt codepre  pis implicitly instantiating the template and requires the extern template .. at the top of the file to avoid duplicate instantiation.p  pMy second question is whether there is some alternative to adding all thesep  precodeextern template class MyTemplateltdoublegt codepre  pto every source file. It just gets a little tedious grepping every instance of the smart pointer for every template I define and making sure I have the correct extern template line in that file. I can also see it being a little difficult to enforce this convention for future developers of our code as they may add a template instantiation and forget the appropriate extern template line, especially since no error will be generated.p

Negative 5382 pSo Ive spent the past few hours trolling through all the genuinely fantastic advice for Web API Versioning.  Some of my favourites, for those having as much fun as I am, in no particular orderp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions389169bestpracticesforapiversioningBest practices for API versioningap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9197931versioningrestapiofanaspnetmvcapplicationVersioning REST API of an ASP.NET MVC applicationap  pa hrefhttpwww.troyhunt.com201402yourapiversioningiswrongwhichis.html relnofollowhttpwww.troyhunt.com201402yourapiversioningiswrongwhichis.htmlap  pa hrefhttpwww.pluralsight.comcourseswebapidesign relnofollowhttpwww.pluralsight.comcourseswebapidesignap  pa hrefhttpwww.pluralsight.comcoursesimplementingrestfulaspdotnetwebapi relnofollowhttpwww.pluralsight.comcoursesimplementingrestfulaspdotnetwebapiap  pSo all this advice has been very helpful in designing what is essentially the front end of the API.  We can version the API calls... Now, Im on to the hard part.p  pThis is a heavily data driven application, for a company with several products this is a new one doing monthly releases.  Some big customers who will want longterm support for API calls, some smaller customers who will want the latest releases.  This we could manage with something similar to milestonelongtermsupport releases of the API. Great.p  pBut in practice this is going to get really messy, really fast.  Weve worked hard to separate out the layers of our own website, the beta InternalExternal APIs, Repository Layers and even an SDK to boot.  We separate out each release out into separate branches, but its SAAS  we host the database.  So were not just going to be able to version the API calls  but everything underneath that.  The Business Logic, Repository and the Database.  Lets not even get started on UnitIntegration Testing.p  pSo, trying and probably failing only ask one question here.  p  pstrongIs there a decent pattern for structuring a layered, datadriven, .NET application to cope with multiple versionsstrongp  pSpecifically how the database will change and how you can structure a generic stack to version it all.   Some ideas I have includep  ul liUpdating old source control branches of the stack and deploying theseli liKeeping everything in the same project, but use foldersnamespacing all the way downli liSplitting the projects further  so the API solution has a number of Controller projects, with similar concepts for the logicrepo layersli ul  pWe have a fair number of developers and no matter how much ace documentation I write, realistically it will only be read when something isnt working.  So ideally it needs to be as glaringly obvious as possible for developers to get this right.p

After i develop the service, the same service should return the data from acutal implementation instead of mock service without any code changesp  pSo basically it should work like when consumer calls any service first my application should check whether any acutal implemetation is present and if not, it should go and check for the mock service implemetation.p  pCan someone help me with thisp

Negative 5382 pI have used Eclipse for some time just for general java development and now I am trying to understand the added features that STS brings, and also learn Spring Boot development. I see that when I create a Spring Boot project it always wants me to select Maven or Gradle as the build tool but Im not sure why or what that does. p  pI just dont fully understand what Maven is doing when Im working in the environment. Eclipse always compiled the code and did other things for me by invoking the compiler and I never needed an external build tool like ant or Maven or whatever.p  pSo is it just making a Maven configuration in case I want to build the application outside the Eclipse environment or does STS rely on an external build toolp
Negative 5382 pIve installed a cluster with impala and sentry CDH 5.2 on CentOS 6.5 using command line and have set up openLDAP without TLS as well. Both are operating without any issues independently. p  pTo get the Hadoop cluster configured for openLDAP, Ive created the required LDAP groups for all the hadoop services as well as have made required entries in coresite.xml and impala config file listing the LDAP uri etc as mentioned by the documentation.  p  pWhen I invoke impalashell for LDAP users using impalashell l u test1 where test1 is a valid openLDAP user, it asks for password, which I supply. The problem is that once this is done  it just hangs. There is absolutely no response at all from impalashell and neither impala logs nor LDAP logs reacord any activity. I also tried capturing tcpdump on port 389 where ldap runs, but it seems there is no communication there from Impala as there are no packets exchanged at all. In contrast, it works perfectly when invoked without the l directive for normal centOS users.

Negative 5382 pIm trying to create a steam tradeoffers bot, Its just a bot that send you a tradeoffers. Im using the module a hrefhttpsgithub.comseishunnodesteam relnofollownodesteama and a hrefhttpsgithub.comAlex7Komnodesteamtradeoffers relnofollownodesteamtradeoffersa. Firstly my code was working and i was able to send tradeoffers, but i want to add socket.io for interaction with the user interface on the frontend and there it is the problem.p  pI use two part, the first is used to connect the bot on steam p  precode Identifiant du compte steam. username  xxxxxx  password  xxxxxx    Si on a sauvegarder une liste de serveurs, on lutilise. if fs.existsSyncservers      steam.servers  JSON.parsefs.readFileSyncservers    On regarde sil existe un sentryfile. var sentryfile iffs.existsSyncsentryfile.  username  .hash      sentryfile  fs.readFileSyncsentryfile.  username  .hash    Tentative de connection. bot.logOn     accountName username,     password password,     shaSentryfile sentryfile    Erreur de connection, si cest  cause du authCode on le demande et on se     reconnecte sinon on affiche lerreur. bot.onerror, functione      if e.eresult  steam.EResult.AccountLogonDenied          prompt.start         prompt.get[authCode], function err, result          bot.logOn             accountName username,             password password,             authCode result.authCode                   function onErrerr          console.logerr         return 1      else      console.logSteam Error   e.eresult     Si on vient de rentrer un authCode, on converse le sentryfile qui vient de se crer. bot.onsentry, functionsentry  console.logGot new sentry file hash from Steam.

But i want to implement socket.io only on the part two and Its not working, the part two is completly ignore, whereas if I put the part one and two in the socket.io Its working. So the problem is related to socket.io, is there any way to use in socket.io a part outside socket.io or all the code used in socket.io need to be in p  pThanks per advancep

Negative 5382 pI can access request params using codeRequestinputcode or codeRequestallcode.p  pThe problem is that my request includes both GET and POST params, but only GET ones are used to calculate signature.p  pIs there a way to retrieve only a set of GET or a set of POST params from request in Laravel 5.1p  pOr going with GET and POST is my only option herep  pThank you.p
Negative 5382 pI started programming in swift 3 days ago so this is probably a pretty obvious question, but I couldnt find the answer anywhere else. I am making a version of flappy bird and Im using a UILabel to display the text, Touch To Begin in my GameViewController.swift properties.p  precodeIBOutlet weak var touchToBegin UILabel codepre  pIn my GameScene.swift class, in the touchToBegin function, I want to change the label text to an empty string so that there isnt text on the screen while the game is being played.p  precodeGameViewController.touchToBegin.text   codepre  pIt gives me an error that says GameViewController.Type does not have a member named touchToBeginp  pDo I need to make the variable public or is there a specific way Im supposed to call it If not, are there any other options It seems like it should be pretty simple. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank youp  precodeltterminatedgt codepre

Negative 5382 pThis post is pretty much a copy and paste from se7ensins because I am someone on here will know what they are doing more than someone on se7ensins.p  pIf I were programming for windows, doing such a thing uses two methods  LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress however, I am trying to do so with xbox and therefore requiring the use of xbox functions. XexGetModuleHandle seems to work flawlessly as a replacement for LoadLibrary, but XexGetProcedureAddress is causing MW2 to freeze at launch. Someone on stack overflow had posted an idea for importing multiple functions the easy way with less lines of code. Here is what they suggested and what I have been using to store functionsp  ptypedef intstdcall intfuncptrt intfuncptrt intfuncptr[sizeofStoredFunctionNames  4]p  pThis creates an array of intfuncptrt and gives the array a needed type for what I am doing with XexGetProcedureAddress. I realize that I am using many of the guy from stack overflows ideas, but they just happened to be conveniently posted where I didnt have to think about what I was doing a lot to understand it. Anyways he suggested that instead of using GetProcAddress by typing it every time you wanted to import a function to throw it through an obvious loop and store the function names in an array and the skeletons not sure if thats the right word for the functions in a struct lastly put them both in one place using a union then use define to rename the functions back to their original names so I didnt have to call functions by typing them the long way. I dont think Im stealing any ideas that arent mine because to me this just makes sense it just happened to be posted in a convenient place.p  pAs of now, I currently have no clue what to do with the second parameter of XexGetProcedureAddress.... Since I dont really understand what its for, I have just been trying random unsigned integers for ordinals. I even googled it and took microsofts advice for how to import functions by ordinal make a .def file and number the imports while importing for the ordinal, but Im stuck at the game still crashing at launch with that. My flaw is most definitely a problem with not understanding what the second parameter, DWORD dwOrdinal, is used for. Obviously, if I dont understand what something is used for, its complicated to use it correctly.p  pintfuncptr[counter]  intfuncptrtXexGetProcedureAddressGetDLL, DWORDcounter  1, ampStoredFunctionNames[counter]p  pThis is what I am doing with XexGetProcedureAddress as of right now and is also the line of code at which the game launch crashes. intfuncptr is defined above as well as intfuncptrt. counter is the integer running through the for loop. GetDLL is the UINT32 hand and StoredFunctionNames is the array containing the function names that I am searching for.p  pDoes anyone happen to have the slightest clue as to what the dwOrdinal is for and how I would use it correctly so the game doesnt crash and my functions all get loaded Any help or information would be greatly appreciated especially because I seem to be stuck in a google loop. Please leave a response if you have any ideas as well. p  pI realize my code is not properly formatted and I would appreciate if someone could give me a pointer on how to do so.  Last time I remember, ctrl  t made ordinary text turn into a code section....  It doesnt seem to do anything anymore and I dont understand why.p  pThanks for the helpp  pP.S.

Negative 5382 pI have two tables.

However, when I run these two queriesp  precodeSELECT f1.id  FROM object70974 f1   LEFT JOIN objectmaster70974 mss0 ON mss0.idobject IN 70974,71759   AND mss0.idmaster  71100 AND mss0.idslave  70912 AND mss0.idfield  f1.id codepre  pand p  precodeSELECT f1.id  FROM object70974 f1   LEFT JOIN objectmaster70974 mss0 ON mss0.idobject IN 70974,71759   AND mss0.idmaster  71100 AND mss0.idfield  f1.id codepre  pthey both return the same number of rows since in fact codeidslavecode field does not really matter  code3530code, however, the first query is slower than the second query by one second  8 and 7 seconds respectively. So, I guess I have to ask two questions  1 why does the second query run faster, even though it does not use index and 2 why does the first query run so slowly and why does not it use an index obviously.

when the item in a row is needed to be displayed, here the int position    Tells us item at which position is being constructed to be displayed and the holder id of the holder object tell us    which

Negative 5382 pIm confused with Javascripts prototype property.  See the below Code.p  precodevar s  12 var s1  new String  console.logs.constructor   Outputs Number  [native code]   console.logs instanceof String  Outputs false console.logs instanceof Object  Outputs false console.logtoString in s    console.logs.isPrototypeOfObject  Outputs false console.logs.prototype.isPrototypeOfObject  console.logs.hasOwnProperty toString  Outputs false  console.logs.toString   Outputs 12  My Question is how does toString function is been called, where does it falls int the prototype chain. Why is it not showing undefined.  console.logs1.constructor  Outputs Number  [native code]   console.logs1 instanceof String  Outputs true codepre  pI understand that when we create an object by using  or constructor new String above, it inherits from Object.prototype. And thats why codeconsole.logs1 instanceof String  Outputs truecode and thus were able to call toString on s1. But im confused with what happens in the case of codevar x  someString or var x  something.codep  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 5382 pIm using elasticsearch in a Rails application. I want my search results can be sorted by price, so i add the price attribute to mapping.
