Positive 572 pIm using the Stanford sentiment analysis part of the CoreNLP Java library. I figured out how to extract the sentiment of nodes using the answer to this question stackoverflow.comquestions23729829sentimentrankednodesindependencyparsewithstanfordcorenlp25935721. I need the sentiment of each node, including leaves and Im getting values of 1 for the sentiment of leaves which should be in the range [0,4].p  pIs there a way to get the sentiment of the leaves I saw in the online demo that use to be online that the leaf nodes of the trees had sentiment value. I feel like the RNTN should be able to output sentiment values. Im using the RNNCoreAnnotations.getPredictedClass function.p  pThanksp

Positive 572 pIve been asked to compute the average depth of a node in both a binary search tree, and an AVL tree. Through some research, I found that the average depth of a tree is the internal path length divided by the number of nodes in a tree, and that the internal path length the sum of the path lengths of every node in the tree is given by this recurrencep  precodeD1  0, DN  Di  DN  i  1  N  1 codepre  pwhere DN is a tree with N nodes, Di, is the IPL of the left subtree, and DNi1 is the IPL of the right subtree.p  pUsing that, I wrote this functionp  precodeint internalPathLengthNode t, intamp sum const         ift  nullptr  tgtleft  nullptr ampamp tgtright  nullptr              return 0                  else              int a  0             sum  internalPathLengthtgtleft, sum  internalPathLengthtgtright, sum  countNodest,a1             cout ltlt sum ltlt endl             return sum          codepre  pThis function gives me, with a binary search tree of 565 nodes, an IPL of 1,264,875,230 and an average depth of 2,238,717, a preposterously high number.

Positive 572 pd3.js tree layout is a great tool, but it only allows children to have a single parent by default. I would like to be able to let children have more than one parent.

Positive 572 pSo I have an exercise that I should prove or disprove thatp  p1 if e is a minimum weight edge in the connected graph G such that not all edges are necessarily distinct, then every minimum spanning tree of G contains ep  p2 Same as 1 but now all edge weights are distinct.p  hr  pOk so intuitively, I understand that for 1 since not all edge weights are distinct, then its possible that a vertex has the path with edge e but also another edge e1 such that if weighte  weight e1 then there is a spanning tree which does not contain the edge e since the graph is connected. Otherwise if both e1 and e are in the minimum spanning tree, then there is a cycle p  pand for 2 since all edge weights are distinct, then of course the minimum spanning tree will contain the edge e since any algorithm will always choose the smaller path. p  pAny suggestions on how to prove these two though induction Not sure how to approach. p

Negative 572 pIm building a flash site that uses video transitions to go from section to section.  Each sections background is a stillframe photo at higher res than the transition videos themselves, which are scaled up during transition. The first frame of each video transition is the current background image, and the last frame of each video transition is the destinations background image. Roughly speaking, this is the intended flow of navigation on the sitep  pResting statebr hires image in foreground, no video elementsp  pUser clicks item on navigationbr Flash prepares an FLV via a netstream object and buffers it, which is accomplished through the netstream.play function.  Upon receipt of the Netstatus.Buffer.Full event, the netstream object is paused and attached to a video object, which is then added to the display list behind the hires image in the foreground. As soon as the video object has been added to the stage, the hires image in the foreground alphas out via tween, leaving only the background video.  When the foreground is finished tweening, the video in the background plays.  As soon as NetStream.Play.Stop is received, the process happens in reverse that is, a new hires foreground image tweens in over the video layer, and the video is removed from the stage as soon as thats done.p  pI dont think theres anything wrong at least in principle with the flow Ive outlined above, and it doesnt sound like it should be that tricky to do.  However, Ive had no end of problems with the initial setting up of the FLVvideo object.  At first, it seemed that the FLV wasnt queuing up properly, by which I mean that the hires foreground image tweened out to reveal a white screen, and the video popped in and only began playing after a second or two.  The first frame of the FLV is definitely not white.  p  pI had no idea what might have been causing this behavior, but hackishly threw in a timer that plays the netstream for about 100 ms after Buffer.Full is received, thereby advancing the video past whatever might have been causing the white screen.  This worked well locally but as soon as I put the site on a dev host, it was back to the white screen during transitions.  The annoying thing is that bumping the hackish delay up to about 2 s got rid of the white screen problem on remote servers, but results were unpredictable depending on connection speed, you might see everything work perfectly, or you might get thrown into a video that had already been playing for a second or two.  p  pIve also tried similar approaches using bytesLoadedbytesTotal instead of netStatus events, to no avail.  My last experiment was using cuepoints during FLV encoding, I threw in a cuepoint 0.2 seconds into the FLV and waited for THAT before tweening out the foreground once again, it worked locally, but I was treated to a tweentowhite before  the video kicked in when testing on a remote server.p  pIm really running out of ideas here and would very much appreciate any advice you guys can offer.  Thanks very much for your time and considerationp  pJustinp

This occurs because of the way WPF selects which HWND to use to send messages from the render thread to the UI thread.

Negative 572 pIm upgrading an MVC app. Previously, the DAL was a part of the Model, as a series of repositories based on the entity name using standard LINQ to SQL queries. Now, its a separate project and is generated using PLINQO.p  pSince PLINQO generates query extensions based on the properties of the entity, I started using them directly in my controller... and eliminated the repositories all together.p  pIts working fine, this is more a question to draw upon your experience, should I continue down this path or should I rebuild the repositories using PLINQO as the DAL within the repository filesp  pOne benefit of just using the PLINQO generated data context is that when I need DB access, I just make one reference to the the data context. Under the repository pattern, I had to reference each repository when I needed data access, sometimes needing to reference multiple repositories on a single controller.p  pThe big benefit I saw on the repositories, were aptly named query methods i.e. FindAllProductsByCategoryIdint id, etc.... With the PLINQO code, its db.Product.ByCatIdint id  which isnt too bad either.p  pI like both, but where it gets harrier is when the query uses predicates. I can roll that up into the repository query method. But on the PLINQO code, it would be something like db.Product.Wherex  x.CatId  1 ampamp x.OrderId  1 Im not so sure I like having code like that in my controllers.p  pWhats your take on thisp

Negative 572 pI am trying to evaluate whether we should migrate from developing our product in ASP.net web forms current technology to Silverlight.

Negative 572 pWe use Microsoft NMAKE to compile a large number of native C and some Intel Fortran files.

We would like to take advantage of multi core processors and compile more than one file at a time. I would appreciate some advice about the best way to make that happen, please. Here is what I have so far.p  pstrongOnestrong GNU make lets you execute parallel jobs using the jobs2 option for example and that works fine with GCC we cant use GCC sadly. But Microsofts NMAKE does not seem to support such an option. How compatible would the two name programs be, and if we did start using GNU MAKE, can you run two cl.exe processes at the same time I would expect them to complain about the PDB debug file being locked, or does one of the newer cl.exe command line arguments get you around thatp  pstrongTwostrong cl.exe has a MP build with multiple processes flag, which lets you compile multiple files at the same time if passed together via the command line, for examplep  pcl MP7 a.cpp b.cpp c.cpp d.cpp e.cppp  pBut using this would require changes to the makefile. Our make files are generated by a our own program from other files, so I can easily change what we put in the makefiles. But how do you combine the dependencies from different cpp files together in the makefile so they get compiled together via one cl.exe call Each .obj is a different target with a set of commands to make itp  pOr do I change the makefile to not call cl.exe, but rather some other little executable that we write, which then collects a series of .cpp files together and shells out to cl.exe passing multiple arguments That would work and seems doable, but also seems overly complicated and I cant see anyone else doing that. p  pAm I missing something obvious There must be a simpler way of accomplishing thisp  pWe do not use Visual Studio or a solution file to do the compiles, because the list of files is extensive, we have a few special items in our makefiles, and theoretically do not want to be overly tied to MS C etc.p

Negative 572 pTo make an ajax site web crawlable by googlebot, it requries that your website send back a HTML snapshot when a page with the escapedfragment variable set. for more info see a hrefhttpcode.google.comwebajaxcrawling relnofollowhereap  pDoes this HTML snapshot need to be styled correctly, i.e. does googlebot use the snapshot to give a preview of your site as you see on the search results page. I ask as some of my pages use javascript to correctly resize images dynamically as this cant by done in the CSS.p  pThanks p

Negative 572 pIm trying to get the Thesis theme working in Wordpress, and its almost perfect. For the navigation menu I want to use images instead of text. My solution to this was to set a background image via css p  precodeul.menu .tab2 a backgroundurlimagesmyimage.jpg norepeatbackgroundcolortransparentwidth81pxheight60pxmargin0pxpadding6pxborderstylenone codepre  pThis works fine everywhere but IE. You only see the image and not the text that Thesis is writing out for that nav item p  precodeltli classtab tab2gtlta hrefhttpwww.mysite.comabout titleAbout UsgtAbout Uslt[if gte IE 7]gtltgtltagtltlt[endif]gt  lt[if lte IE 6]gtlttablegtlttrgtlttdgtlt[endif]gt  codepre  pIn IE, however, the href text does show up over the background image. I suppose this is what I expected to happen, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it not working like that in every other browser. p  pWhat Im trying to figure out is if there is a way to get the background image to show up on top of the href text, effectively blotting it out. I have tried hacking Thesis to suppress writing out the text, which works in all the menu items except one, and that is because I am writing out categories, not pages. p  pI really want to use Thesis nav menu and not roll my own because Im sure then I would have more troubles getting the drop downs to look nice in all browsers, and my css is just not that advanced. And I dont think there is a way to tell Thesis to use an image instead of text for the nav menu item. p  pI have been staring at this for hours and clearly am not thinking clearly about it anymore. p

Negative 572 pI am developing a Catalyst app which uses codeTemplateToolkitcode as template engine. One page needs a list of equal input elements.

Negative 572 pI already tried several methods on displaying an image on a form, but none of them works how I would like. p  pIve read many places that the easiest way is to create a label and use that to display the image. I have a label, which size is specified by the layout, but if I load an image into it with a pixmap, the label is resized to the size of the image. If I use img tag as text or css background property, it wont display the whole image. What I would like to do is to load the image and fit into the label, not changing the labels size, but when I resize my window, and by that resizing the label as well, the image should be resized too so it will always fit into it.p  pIf the only method is to get the labels size, and resize the pixmap so it would fit, and handle the resize event signal, how could I resize the pixmap I hope I wont need to save the whole thing into a QImage and create a pixmap from it each time.p  pAlso, how can I center it If it cant fit both the width and the height, I would like the smaller dimension to be centered.p  pOh, and I dont want to use sliders to handle overflows.p
Negative 572 pOur company helps migrate client software from other languages to C.  We provide them C source code for their application along with header files and compiled libraries for runtime support functions.  We charge for both the migration as well as the runtime.  Recently a potential client asked to migrate one of a number of systems they have.  This system contains 7 programs and we would like to limit the runtime so only these 7 programs can acess it.  We can time limit the runtime by putting an encrypted expiration date in the object library but, since we have to provide the source code for the converted programs, we are having difficult coming up with a way to limit the access to a specific set of programs. Obviously, anything we put into the source code to identify the program could be copied to any other program so the only hope seems to be having the run time library discover some set of characteristics about the programs and then validating them against a set of characteristics embedded in the run time library.  As I understand it, C has very little reflection capability RTTI is all I could find so I wanted to ask if anyone has faced a similar problem and found a way to solve it.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.p  pBased on the two answers a little clarification seems in order.  We fully expect the client to modify the source code and normally we provide them an unrestricted version of the runtime libraries.  This particular client requested a version that was limited to a single system and is happy to enter into a license that restricts the use of the runtime library to that system.  Therefore a discussion of the legal issues isnt relevant.  The issue is a technical one  given a license that is limited to a single system and given that the client has the source to the calling programs but not the runtime, is there a way to limit access to the runtime to the set of programs comprising that system thus enforcing the terms of the license.  p

Negative 572 pI want to build a visual studio plugin that automatically annotates classes for serialization. For example for the built in binary serializer I could just add code[Serializable]code to the class declaration, for WCF it could add code[DataContract]code to the class and code[DataMember]code to the members and properties I could get code[KnownType]code information through reflection and annotate where appropriate. If using protocol buffers it could add code[ProtoContract]code, code[ProtoMember]code and code[ProtoInclude]code attributes and so on. I am assuming that the classes we are going to use this on are safe to serialize so no sockets or nonserializable stuff in there. What I want to know is what is the easier way to take an existent piece of code or a binary if thats easier and add those attributes while preserving the rest of the code intact. I am fine with the output being source code or binary.p  pIt comes to mind the idea of a using a C parser, parse everything find the interesting code elements, annotate them and write back the code. However that seems to be very complex given the relatively small amount of modifications I want to make to the code. Is there an easier way to do sop

Negative 572 pIm writing a search engine to explore multiple search algorithms. The web portion floats on Struts 2.1.6 and Tiles 2.2.2.

Variant 2 would submit to some of the same search algorithms as Variant 1, with the same results page, but of course I want the Variant 2 searchform to show up at the top for consistency.  The new flow would bep  ol liSelect a searchform. For Vanilla, goto 2. For Crazy, goto 3.li liSelect a search algorithm from A, B, C and enter search parameters. Goto 4.li liSelect a search algorithm from B, C, D, E and enter search parameters. Goto 4.li liSubmit. Chain using Struts chain resulttype to the appropriate search action for the selected algorithm.li liDisplay results. Include a copy of Vanilla  Crazy search form.li ol  p The switch to chain is to allow more automated passing of algorithm parameters. The old way used hidden fields and was a huge pain to maintain with redirects, as youll see in the struts.xml below.p  pSo for the single variant I have something like thisp  precodestruts.xml     ltaction nameSearchPage classnies.actions.search.SearchFormgt         ltresult nameinputgtSearch.jspltresultgt     ltactiongt  lt List of available search algorithms to fill searcher param above gt      ltaction nameAlgorithmA classnies.actions.search.AlgorithmAgt         ltresult namesuccess typetilesgtResultsltresultgt         ltresult nameinputtyperedirectActiongt                 ltparam nameactionNamegtSearchPageltparamgt                 ltparam namenamespacegtltparamgt                 ltparam namesearchAlgorithmgtAlgorithmAltparamgt         ltresultgt     ltactiongt     ltaction nameAlgorithmB classnies.actions.search.AlgorithmBgt         ltresult namesuccess typetilesgtResultsltresultgt         ltresult nameinput typeredirectActiongt                 ltparam nameactionNamegtSearchPageltparamgt                 ltparam namenamespacegtltparamgt                 ltparam namesearchAlgorithmgtAlgorithmBltparamgt         ltresultgt     ltactiongt     ltaction nameAlgorithmC classnies.actions.search.AlgorithmCgt         ltresult namesuccess typetilesgtResultsltresultgt         ltresult nameinput typeredirectActiongt                 ltparam nameactionNamegtSearchPageltparamgt                 ltparam namenamespacegtltparamgt                 ltparam namesearchAlgorithmgtAlgorithmCltparamgt         ltresultgt     ltactiongt codepre  pSo what I plan to add is thisp  precodestruts.xml     ltaction nameCrazySearchPage classnies.actions.search.CrazySearchFormgt         ltresult nameinputgtCrazySearch.jspltresultgt         ltresult namesuccess typechaingtsearcherltresultgt     ltactiongt codepre  pprobably switching the search input display for both search pages to tiles to save copypasta and nuking all the input redirect param crap for the search algorithms, since chaining automatically keeps those values on the stackp  p...but now Im hosed, because the chained actions shared by both SearchPage and  CrazySearchPage all display in the Results tilep  precodetiles.xml lttilesdefinitionsgt   ltdefinition nameResults templateresultsTemplate.jspgt ltputattribute nametabPane valueresultsEagerTabPane.jspgt   ltdefinitiongt   ... codepre  pAnd the Results tile includes the regular searchform code used in the regular SearchPagep  precoderesultsTemplate.jsp lt taglib prefixs uristrutstags gt lt taglib prefixtiles urihttptiles.apache.orgtagstiles gt lthtmlgt ltheadgt   lttitlegtltsproperty valuequery.queryStringgtlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ... ltdiv idsearchformgt lttilesinsertTemplate templatesearchform.jsp flushtruegt ltdivgt ... codepre  pI want to believe that by switchingp  precodelttilesinsertTemplate templatesearchform.jsp flushtruegt codepre  ptop  precodelttilesinsertAttribute namesearchform flushtruegt codepre  pI can then either 1 make a new tile for CrazyResults that passes in the appropriate searchform jsp, or B find some way to pass in the tiles attribute based on which SearchPage runs.p  pThe problem with 1 is that the chained algorithm actions already go to the regular Results tile, and I dont want to disallow those algorithms from the regular SearchPage just so I can use them on the CrazySearchPage.

Negative 572 pI need to remove certain accounts like the Everyone trustee or some global group that is giving everyone access to a folder from an ACL on a particular subfolder of a share.  I get a DirectorySecurity object, get and loop through the AuthorizationRuleCollection, remove the AccessRule in question from the ACL, and then I call SetAccessControl to apply the changes.  Everything works fine if the target folder is small, but if it has a lot of child folders and files, it can take forever to apply the changes much longer than to just do it manually.  I only want to deal with the ACL on the target folder.  Is there a way to do this using the .net DirectorySecurity classes  Or do I have to resort to the Win32 API or some other solution  Thanks.p  pHere is a snippet of code.  The call to dirInfo.SetAccessControldirSec is where it hangs when the folder size is very large.p  precodeDirectoryInfo dirInfo  new DirectoryInfopath DirectorySecurity dirSec  dirInfo.GetAccessControl AuthorizationRuleCollection acl  dirSec.GetAccessRulestrue, true,                                        typeofSystem.Security.Principal.NTAccount foreach FileSystemAccessRule ace in acl      if groupsToRemove.Containsace.IdentityReference.Value              dirSec.RemoveAccessRuleSpecificace         dirInfo.SetAccessControldirSec       codepre

Negative 572 pI have a question regarding Android Notification and activity order.p  pI have following scenariop  pI have ActivityMain as my first activity, which performs some task. When BACK button is pressed It generates notification. ActivityMain has following calls codeonKeyDowncode, codeOnPausecode, codeOnStopcode, codeOnDestroycode. When user clicks the notification icon ActivityMain is started and call sequence is codeOnCreatecode, codeOnResumecode. Which is fine.p  pNow ActivityMain contains button which starts ActivitySecond using codeStartActivityForResultcode api and also generates notification of task progress, function calls are codeonSaveInstancecode, codeOnPausecode, codeOnStopcode. If user presses back button on ActivitySecond by codesetResultresultcode, everything works fine. But if the user selects the Notification icon activityseconds is visible then new instance on Activitymain codeonCreatecode, codeOnResumecode started.

Negative 572 pI have a project I manage out of a git repository. We use the progit branching strategy as described in the accepted answer, here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2428722gitbranchstrategyforsmalldevteamGit branch strategy for small dev teama where one branch is the production branch and another branch is the developmenttesting branch. We deploy the code using fabric.p  pWhen were ready to make a new production release with git, we merge the developmenttesting branch into the production branch and then deploy the production branch using fabric. The problem is that there are code differences between development and production  some logos change, some different DB hostscredentials, that sort of thing. Ive been keeping a .patch file containing the differences and having fabric apply the patch when it deploys the production environment, but this doesnt work that well. In particular, it totally fails if some of the code around the patch has changed  the patch fails to apply and my deploy aborts.p  pIve been wondering if I shouldnt just apply all my changes to the production branch directly What are the drawbacks of thisp  pOne particular use case Im concerned about is if we need to make a hotfix. We currently do this by branching from the production environment, making changes, and then merging that branch back into both development and production. If the production branch is different from the development one, can those changes get pulled into the development branch when the hotfix is merged into developmentp

Negative 572 pI read up on a hrefhttpfreespace.virgin.nethugo.eliasmodelsmperlin.htm relnofollowthisa article about Perlin Noise and have a few questions if anyone has the answers because I seem to be having some issues.  In the pseudo code 2D section near the bottom, it shows he randomly generates numbers but instead of one variable as a parameter in the 1D code, he now uses an x and a y.  Is this required in 2 dimensional noise or no  Also, his PerlinNoise2D Function takes 2 float parameters now instead of 1 like in the 1 dimensional example.  What are these float values supposed to be and where do they come from because I cannot find how to get them for the life of me.  So if anyone knows the answers to any of my questions, I would greatly appreciate some help.  Thanks.p  pEDIT Ok simpler question, where do I get the 2 float values taken as parameters for the PerlinNoise2D functionp

Negative 572 pI am trying to have some configuration settings in Django be automatically determined at runtime.p  pI have set up a middleware handler that runs once, before the first request is made, and then disables itself by raising MiddlewareNotUsed. When the handler runs, it pulls some information from another server via HTTP. I would like to have that information become available for use in all views.p  pIn the settings module, I have an empty string. I thought that I would be able to dynamically modify this with the retrieved information, so that it would become available to all the views. But when I update the string from the middleware handler, the information is somehow lost. The views see only the empty string.p  pHow would I make the information that was retrieved over HTTP available to all the viewsp  pI would like to keep it in memory, not in a database or on the filesystem, though I will use one of those options if that is the only choice.p

Negative 572 pI manage an ASP.NET MVC 3 website with multiple online transactions. In the website, customers can place orders, pay bills while vendors can bill customers. All this can happen simultaneously so I have semaphores to ensure thread safety.p  pWhat I have noticed is that about once a week, the website stalls for ten minutes. My first tought was for deadlocks in the semaphores, but after putting in place a semaphore log and analysing the results, there seems to be no deadlocks. Also, the website comes back by itself after ten minutes.p  pWhile investigating, I noticed that the entire website becomes irresponsive and not just the parts using the semaphores. They all use the database tough. That is why my primary suspect is the database.p  pWhat is stranger is that every time, the website freeze for ten minutes almost to the second. Could SQL Server have a scheduled maintenance or anything that could explain this delay If not, do you have any idea what could cause thisp

Negative 572 pI have a captcha image that looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSlDew.png altp  pUsing a utility called a hrefhttpwww.mcafee.comusdownloadsfreetoolstessercap.aspx relnofollowTesserCapa from McAfee, I could apply a chopping filter to the image. Before running it, I made sure there were only two colors in the image, white and black. I was very impressed with the results of using that filter with a value of 2 in the text box. It accurately removed most of the noise but kept the main text, resulting in thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRWWms.png altp  pI wanted to implement something like this on one of my own scripts, so I tried to find out what image processing library TesserCap used. I couldnt find anything it turns out it uses its own code to process the image. I then read a hrefhttpwww.mcafee.comusresourceswhitepapersfoundstonewptessercapvisualcaptchatool.pdf relnofollowthis whitepapera that explains exactly how the program works. It gave me the following description of what this chopping filter doesp  blockquote   pIf the contiguous number of pixels for given grayscale values are less   than the number provided in the numeric box, the   chopping filter replaces these sequences with 0 black or 255 white   as per user choice. The CAPTCHA is analyzed in both horizontal and   vertical directions and corresponding changes are made.p blockquote  pI am not sure I understand what it is doing. My script is in Python, so I tried using PIL to manipulate the pixels kind of like that quote described. It sounds kind of simple, but I failed, probably because I didnt really know what exactly the filter was doingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOMdEF.png alt This is made from a slightly different captcha that uses a circular pattern.p  pI also tried seeing if it could easily be done with ImageMagicks convert.exe. Their chop option is something completely different. Using median along with some morphology commands helped to reduce some of the noise, but nasty dots appeared and the letters became very distorted. It wasnt nearly as simple as doing the chopping filter with TesserCap.p  pSo, my question is as follows how do I implement the chopping filter of TesserCap in Python, be it using PIL or ImageMagick That chopping filter works much better than any of the alternatives Ive tried, but I cant seem to replicate it. Ive been working on this for hours and havent figured anything out yet.p

Negative 572 pIm developing a Facebook app that has a responsive layout. Sometimes my app has to generate a link for the user. Whenever possible, the links will send the user to a emPage Tabem when the user is on a desktop and other times it will link directly to the app when the user is on a mobile phone.p  pWhat is the default behavior for Facebook on tablets Does it show the mobile site or the desktop sitep  pShould I use the emmobileem or emdesktopem version of my app on tabletsp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong emIn response to BBogs question in the commentsem My app prefers the desktop version because it includes a Likegate. If the user experience is good for a tablet to view the app in a page tab which is only available on www.facebook.com ie nonmobile, then that is preferred because the like button will be displayed at the top of the page, above the apps iframe. In contrast, the mobile version of the app requires that the user click a link that takes them to the mobile facebook page which they must like to ungate the app. It adds an extra step for the user and requires that they navigate away from the app for a moment. Users might be discouraged by this extra step and decide not to enter the gate.p

Negative 572 pWe use a few asp.net UserControl libraries in some of our SharePoint sites. Sometimes we make changes to the UserControls assembly or sometimes some of the assemblies it depends on can change such as a logging assembly. We have these assemblies in the GAC. When we replace the current version with a new version of the assembly, the code changes do not take effect until an iisreset is performed. Like the assembly SharePoint is actually using is cached elsewhere on disk or in memory  If Im the only one using the SharePoint site, an iisreset is fine, but if there are other users using the site for data input or other development, it can really mess them up. Can someone explain what Im seeing happening here and tell me if there is a way to force the assembly to reload from the GAC so I can see my code changes without an iisresetp

Negative 572 pIm using Visual Studio 2010 SP 1 w .NET 4.0 and I just upgraded to ReSharper 7.

Either way, functioning autocomplete looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfX7YE.png altenter image description herep  pId really, really like autocomplete to work automatically as soon as I type this. can you helpp  pIve tried suspending and unsuspending ReSharper, restarting Visual Studio, restarting Visual Studio with ReSharper suspended, and combing the ReSharper autocomplete options.  Ive tried clearing the ReSharper cache, suspending ReSharper, and emthenem restarting Visual Studio.  It doesnt appear to be related to these things in a way that I can see.p  pIve also tried typing this. very slowly and the behavior did not change it doesnt appear to be a race condition.  Visual Studio itself autocompletes correctly but using ReSharper autocomplete always has this problem.p  pThanks in advance for any advice you can givep  pstrongUpdatestrong After restarting Visual Studio again, the autocomplete selections did appear correctly emonceem if I typed this. before VS  ReSharper seemed to fully load it hiccuped while I typed and when it recovered, the autocomplete was correct.  Subsequent attempts reverted to the undesirable behavior.p  pThis is really weird.

Negative 572 pIm new to databases and have been reading that adding an index to a field you need to search over can dramatically speed up search times.  I understand this reality, but am curious as to how it actually works.  Ive searched a bit on the subject, but havent found any good, concise, and not over technical answer to how it works.p  pIve read the analogy of it being like an index at the back of a book, but in the case of a data field of unique elements such as email addresses in a user database, using the back of the book analogy would provide the same linear look up time as a nonindexed seach.p  pWhat is going on here to speed up search times so much  Ive read a little bit about searching using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiB2BtreeSearch relnofollowBTreesa, but the descriptions were a bit too indepth.  What Im looking for is a high level overview of what is going on, something to help my conceptual understanding of it, not technical details.p

Negative 572 pI want to get an entity key knowing entity ID and an ancestor. ID is unique within entity group defined by the ancestor. It seems to me that its not possible using ndb interface. As I understand datastore it may be caused by the fact that this operation requires full index scan to perform.

Im able now to do an ancestor query and get the keyp  precodeclass SomeModelndb.Model     ID  ndb.ComputedProperty lambda self self.key.id       classmethod     def idtokeycls, identifier, ancestor         return cls.querycls.ID  identifier,                          ancestor  ancestor.key .get keysonly  True codepre  pIt seems to work, but are there any better solutions to this problemp  pstrongUpdatestrong It seems that for datastore the natural solution is to use full paths instead of identifiers. Initially I thought itd be too burdensome. After reading dragonx answer I redesigned my application. To my suprise everything looks much simpler now. Additional benefits are that my entities will use less space and I wont need additional indexes. p

So this block may really well be executed a couple of times before the user sees the notifications. When this block is reexecuted when something has been added to the sList, it overrides the current notifications, because the IDs of the notification are the same. How can I prevent that from happening How can I get a unique ID every time Or is there maybe possible to avoid the whole ID part, like telling android that is has to show the notification anyway, no matter what the ID isp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 572 pI started to put printstatements throughout my code. So as not to clutter up the output, I did something likep  precodedputs LEVEL, string codepre  pwhere codeLEVELcode is 0 for errors, 1 for important .. 5 for verbose and is compared to codeDEBUGLEVELcode. Now my problem is, that in a statement likep  precodedputs 5, bigclass.inspect codepre  pthe string is always evaluated, also if I set codeDEBUGLEVELcode to 1. And this evaluation can take a long time. My favourite solution would be something likep  precodedputs 5, bigclass.inspect codepre  pand then evaluate the string if desired. But I dont manage to get the string in a form I can evaluate. So the only think I could come up with isp  precodedputs 5  bigclass.inspect  codepre  pbut this looks just ugly.

Negative 572 pI will have to admit the title of this question sucks... I couldnt get the best description out. Let me see if I can give an example.p  pI have about 2700 customers with my software at one time was installed on their server. 1500 or so still do. Basically what I have going on is an Auto Diagnostics to help weed out people who have uninstalled or who have problems with the software for us to assist with. Currently we have a cURL fetching their website for our software and looking for a header return.p  pWe have 8 different statuses that are returnedp  pGREEN  Everything works usually pretty quick 0.5  2 secondsbr  RED  Software not found usually the longest from 5  15 secondsbr  BLUE  Software found but not activated usually from 3  9 secondsbr  YELLOW  Server IP mismatch usually from 1  3 secondsbr  ORANGE  Server IP mismatch and wrong software type usually 5  10 secondsbr  PURPLE  Activation key incorrect usually within 2 secondsbr  BLACK  Domain returns 404  No longer exists usually within a secondbr  UNK  Connection failed usually due to our load balancer  VERY rare never countered this yetbr p  pNow basically what happens is a cronJob will start the process by pulling the domain and product type. It will then cURL the domain and start cycling through the status colors above.p  pWhile this is happening we have an ajax page that is returning the results so we can keep an eye on the status.

Negative 572 pI made annotations appear when clicking on the plot symbols using codeplotSymbolWasSelectedAtRecordIndexcode, but for some plot symbols they appear very far and for some near the symbol, like it should. For example when clicking on the minimum point in the graph, the codeCTPPlotSpaceAnnotiationcode appears at the left side of the screen, not near the point. p  pEDIT I figured what the problem is. NSNumber x gets no value, because the variable dates is a NSString and I think that it must be converted to NSDate and then to NSNumber. Should I get the number of months from the variables dates, in order to use it in the variable anchor point, so that the annotation will show up near the plot symbol.p  pAnother EDIT Like I said above, I converted the NSString dates into NSDate and then into NSNumber and when I debug now, it shows me the number of days I think. But now when I click on the plot symbol, the annotation doesnt appear any more. For example if the date is 07.2010, then x gets the value 299624400.0 and the annotation isnt working any more.p  pThis is the codep  precodevoidscatterPlotCPTScatterPlot plot

Negative 572 pI was playing around with asynchronous features of .NET a little bit and came up with a situation that I couldnt really explain. When executing the following code inside a synchronous ASP.NET MVC controllerp  precodevar t  Task.Factory.StartNewgt         var ctx  System.Web.HttpContext.Current         ctx  null here ,     CancellationToken.None,     TaskCreationOptions.None,     TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext   t.Wait codepre  pcodectxcode is codenullcode within the delegate. Now to my understanding, the context should be restored when you use the codeTaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContextcode task scheduler. So why isnt it here I can, btw, see that the delegate gets executed synchronously on the same thread.p  pAlso, from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comquerydev10.queryappIdDev10IDEF1amplENUSampkk28SYSTEM.THREADING.TASKS.TASKSCHEDULER.FROMCURRENTSYNCHRONIZATIONCONTEXT29k28TargetFrameworkMoniker22.NETFRAMEWORK,VERSIONV4.02229k28DevLangCSHARP29amprdtruemsdna, a codeTaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContextcode should behave as follows p  blockquote   pAll Task instances queued to the returned scheduler will be executed   through a call to the Post method on that context.p blockquote  pHowever, when I use this codep  precodevar wh  new AutoResetEventfalse  SynchronizationContext.Current.Postsgt      var ctx  System.Web.HttpContext.Current     ctx is set here     wh.Set     return ,null  wh.WaitOne codepre  pThe context is actually set.p  pI know that this example is little bit contrived, but Id really like to understand what happens to increase my understanding of asynchronous programming on .NET.p
Negative 572 pI use delayed job to carry out background tasks in my app. It does some stuff and then sends a mail. This is an example of the code block preformed as a delayed job.p  precodedef task   do stuff  AppMailer.post.sometemplatevariable end codepre  pThis has been working fine, I have a template in the correct directory sometemplate.text.plain.erb. I have started seeing this raise a MissingTemplate exception and this stops the delayed job and tries again after a given time as expected when exceptions are raised in delayed job. Some cases this will fail 2 or 3 times and then deliver successfully, other cases there will be no exception raised. How can a template not exist then be found successfully upon the next attemptp  pThe error is looking for a template code.erbcode is the codeplain.text.erbcode causing this problem.

Negative 572 pFor an app I am working on, one of my teammates has been working on a generic error handler that performs some reporting to our team when one of our systems gets into an exceptional state, at a relatively high level.p  pHowever, a few weeks back, I wrote some code at a low level specifically, database access that provides some notification.  With the advent of this team members highlevel code, the rest of the team feels we can safely remove my trycatch system.p  pOne catch theres a codeIsSuccessfulcode flag on the data structure returned from this particular repository method.  When an exception occurs, this flag is kept false on successful data acquisition, the flag is set to true.p  pSo, for the time being, my code looks like thisp  precodepublic FooResult Foo    FooResult result  new FooResult  IsSuccessful  false    SqlParameter[] args  new []         Some args, immaterial to the situation.       try        DataSet ds  SqlHelper.ExecuteDatasetconnection, CommandType.Text, query, args     result  new FooResult                              IsSuccessful  true,                 ...Other fields are set...                    catch        result.IsSuccessful  false     throw    Per request       return result  codepre  pWhich leads to my strongQuestionstrong upon throwing an exception and it being handled at a higher level, what happens after that  Does my code bubble back down to where it left off, or does execution resume elsewhere  When things go wrong and are cleaned up at a different level, where does the code keep goingp
Negative 572 pIs it possible to get a reference to the primary Stage in a running JavaFX application .p  pThe context of this question is that I would like to write a library that manipulates a JavaFX interface from another language Prolog. In order to do this, my library requires access to the primary Stage. The objective is that the programmer of the JavaFX application does not have to explicit store a reference to the Stage object in the start method, so it should be transparent for the user interface designer this is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15799940interactingwiththecontrolsofajavafxapplicationfromaforeignlanguagepa related questiona  in case more details are needed. p  pPart of this problem is getting a reference to the primary Stage object of the original JavaFX application ,so I was wondering if something like a static method somewhere could give me access to that.p

Negative 572 pI understand that it is good practice to use a unique initialization vector for encrypting each record, but how is it then possible to search on that fieldp  pCurrently I use a single IV, which means I can reconstruct the encrypted search string for, say, an email address and query that field in the database. If I start using unique initialization vectors I wouldnt be able to reconstruct the encrypted search string.p  pMy environment is ASP.NET, Entity Framework and SQL Server.

But it is really a complex work when I have five listboxes in the actual software. So I am wondering whether there is an easy way to do this, like overloading some functions in tkinter.Menu class I tried overloading post, grid, pack and place, none of them works. p  pAny idea is welcomed. p

Negative 572 pI have a texture atlas that Im generating from an array of uints. Sampling from it in my pixel shader, colors are coming out correctly.

With color working, Ive extended the texture atlas to include depth information as well. There are only a few thousand depth values that I want, well under 24 bits worth my depth buffer is 24 bits wide  an 8 bit stencil. The input depth values are uints, just like the colors, though of course in the depth case the values are going to be spread over four color channels and in the shader I want a single float between 0 and 1, so that will need to be computed from the sample. Heres the additional pixel shader codep  precode u and v are recalculated for the depth portion of the texture atlas float4 depthSample  textureAtlas.SamplesmoothSampler, float2u,v float depthValue       depthSample.b  65536.0       depthSample.g  256.0       depthSample.r      65793.003921568627450980392156863 output.Depth  depthValue codepre  pThe long constant here is 16777216255, which should map the full uint range down to a unorm. p  pNow, when Im generating the texture, if I constrain the depth values to the range of 0..2048, the output depth is correct. However, if I allow the upper limit of the range to increase even if its simply by taking the input values and performing a left shift by 16, then the output depths will be slightly off. Not by much, just  0.002, but its enough to make the output look terrible. p  pCan anybody spot my bug here Or, more generally, is there a better way of packing and unpacking uints into textures p  pIm working in shader model 4 level 93 and C 11. p

I can create and execute the storyboard in code behind, but i do knot how to access the header template based on the browser that is navigating. Is there a way to do this Or possibly a way to do this from event triggers in the xamlp  pstrongEDITstrong  Added XAML code. Theres no real code behind right now other than the tabitem class and collection pieces and the webbrowser utility class i used to bind to the source property of the webbrowser control which ive added as well.

Negative 572 pI use rails as backend for ios applications. So far i have been using devise as it looks flexible and comfortable to use with less effort . And i have read about omniauth and that too  looks easy to integrate with devise. My question is, consider my ios app requires authentication and the following are the different methods that i should be able to allow user to dop  ol lipLogin using email and passwordpli lipLogin using Facebook accountpli lipLogin using Twitter accountpli ol  pLogin using email can be handled by the devise itself but how about login using Facebook and twitter Actually in one of my project i came up with the following approach which has all three of these login process. The ios app authenticates the user from the devicenot devise itself and sends the user information like username, email etc whatever required along with auth type so i save this a separate user with username that is sent and one of the field as password. And the next time he sends me these details i allow him to login to the app. But now i realised this is not the best way to do. I read about FBgraph which can be used to verify the access token validity, so should i get the token from user and then verify it and get the profile information and save it in user model and give them the token. p  pAlso i have another doubt which is, For login using email and password i allow user to login through email and password and then for the each requests the user sends me the username and password. Is this is alright or do i have to create a token in login request and send the token as response and then the user can send the token for all the other request he makes.p  pSorry if it is confusing but to tell you shortly i need to know what should i do if i have all these three login process. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thankyou p

Negative 572 pWe are using C and .NET 4 to build an WCFenabled application. We have a parent assembly that implementsp  precode[DataContract] public abstract class A    ...  codepre  pThen, other child assemblies implement subclasses of codeAcode, like thisp  precode[DataContract] public class B  A    ...  codepre  pIn another assembly we have some methods that we are trying to encapsulate as WCF services. Some of these methods have a return type of codeAcode.p  pEvidently, child assemblies need to include a reference to the parent assembly in order for derived classes to inherit from class codeAcode. The problem arises when WCF seems to demand that we add codeKnownTypecode attributes to class codeAcode to list all its potential subclasses this would need that the parent assembly where codeAcode resides had references to the child assemblies, which would create circular dependencies.p  pIs there any other way around this Does WCF really need to know the types of all the potential concrete classes of an abstract class that is being used as a return type Thank you.p  pstrongEDITstrong. We have tried the approach based on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.serialization.knowntypeattribute.methodnamevvs.100.aspx relnofollowKnownTypeAttribute.MethodNamea, as suggested by some comments. This would allow us to dynamically load the assemblies where the subclasses reside and return the subclasses to WCF on demand. It works when class codeAcode is used as a return type, but it doesnt work when it is used as a method parameter we keep obtaining a type not expected WCF error. Well keep trying approaches.p
Negative 572 h2The Problemh2  pI am looking for hopefully a design pattern I might be ignorant of that can help be accomplish some codeseparation for the problem Ive defined belowp  pI have a set of classes that represent various entities such as codePointcode, codeVectorcode, codeArccode, etc., that belong on a 2D Cartesian plane, represented by a class codeModelcode. The codeModelcode class acts as a collection for these entities as well as storing useful calculated values.p  pI also have a visual interface that should render a 2D image of the state of the model, and can also interact with the model to a small degree by adding entities to the model for instance, the user can add a codePointcode to the model by clicking on the GUI somewhere..p  h2First Ideah2  pAt first, I had an interface codeDrawablecode that had one method, codeDrawcode, that would accept a graphics context object, and the implementing entity would draw itself to that context using the graphics libraries I am using Java SwingAWT in this case.p  pThis worked well in that the GUI portion of my application simply had to loop through all of the entities in my model and run their codeDrawcode method to generate the visualization. The big problem was that I was marrying my model to its graphical representation, and I feel like this bad practice.p  h2Second Ideah2  pI created a codeEntityDrawercode class that would accept an entity, choose a correct drawing method based on the type of entity, then draw to my graphics context.p  pThis approach accomplished the codeseparation I was looking for, but the codeEntityDrawercode class relied heavily on an codeinstanceOfcodecodeisAcode approach to determine how to draw the entity, which I have repeatedly seen described as poor design. I tried redesigning this so that class used overloaded methods to determine which drawing method to use, but I realized that this was basically the same codeinstanceOfcodecodeisAcode approach written in a nicer looking way. Also, for every new entity class that I add, I would need to mirror that in this codeEntityDrawercodes code, which feels like a form of coupling to me.p  hr  pI would like to have as much decoupling between my model and its graphical representation as possible, so that the model can focus on modeling a problem and not on how to render itself to a graphics context. Furthermore, it is likely that I will be adding more model entity types in the future that will have drastically different drawing needs.p  pSo, is there a pattern or design technique I can use to accomplish this I feel like the two solutions I came up with are sub optimal and that there is probably a design pattern out there that can take care of exactly this kind of problem.p

When a cell is tapped, I load an SKView, which presents an SKScene containing all relevant game data downloaded from Parse.com beforehand.p  pThe problem is, I cant figure out how to get the scene to update, for lack of a better term, with all the current game data.  The presented scene just shows the background image and a few other images, as expected, but the sprites that should be on screen are not.  Instead, its the sprites that WERE on screen when I swiped out of the SKScene last.  I can log all the passed in game data into the console, so I know theres no problem there.  Also, when I perform some kind of action on the scenes sprites removing, refreshing, etc., it causes the scene and all its sprite to kind of wake up, and all the sprites that were supposed to be there show up.p  pA second, possibly related, problem is that, when I swipe from the SKScene back to the main table view, willMoveFromView does not get called.  This is where I do all the cleanup code for the sprites, background, buttons, etc.  Its only when I tap that same table view cell and go back into the same game scene that willMoveFromView gets called.  Shouldnt it get called upon swiping out of the SKSceneSKView  But, again, I run into the same updating problem where the scene is kind of frozen with the old datasprites.  Any ideas  Ive tried to include all relevant code, but I dont think youll find anything out of the ordinary.

Negative 572 pI want to test my angular app with protractor. The app has an API Module that talks to the server During these tests I want to mock this Api Module. I dont want to do full integration tests, but tests from the user input with expected values from the API. Not only could this make the client tests faster, it would also allow me to test for edge cases, like connection errors.p  pHow can I do this with protractor I just started to setup integration tests.p  pI used the npm protractor module, installed selenium, adjusted the default config and used the a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorblobmasterexampleonProtractorRunner.jsonProtractorRunner.jsa to verify my setup works.p  pWhat is the recommended way of mocking I assume that the mocking has to be done within the browser and not directly in the test file. I assume that the commands in the test file are protractor specific and will be sent to the selenium runners. Therefore I cant share javascript objects during the session and the test.p  pI somehow expect that I will need a spy library like a hrefhttpsinonjs.orgsinon.jsa or is this already included in protractorp  pstrongEditstrong I read about a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorissues31this issue in the protractor issue trackera, which could be a way to do it. Basically you write a Mock Module in the test, that is sent to be executed in the browser the applications scope.p  pstrongEditstrong Here are more promising Issues. The first talks about a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorissues110adding Mocks to the Angular Appa. The second talks about a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularprotractorissues69mocking the backenda.p  pThis looks really nice, in this case the Angular App would stay in its original form. However this currently only works with the deprecated ngscenarios.p

Negative 572 pI have an array, which contain lines from a txt file which I need to insert into a sql table, however 4 of the 24 columns all values t spaced are dates but with time etc on the end so all need to be shortened by 15 characters so substr. p  pSo Ive tried numerous methods to alter the values in the file then insert them, but it either just doesnt seem to work like my current codep  precodelines  fileFxamptesthtdocsUniProjectuploadAmazon output.txt foreacharr as line       arr1  explodet, line       arr1[2]  substrarr1[2], 0, 15      arr1[3]  substrarr1[3], 0, 15     arr1[4]  substrarr1[4], 0, 15     arr1[5]  substrarr1[5], 0, 15     arri  implodet,arr1     fileputcontentsuploadImportLine.txt, arri     mysqlquery LOAD DATA INFILE FxamptesthtdocsUniProjectuploadAmazon output.txt INTO TABLE importedorders FIELDS TERMINATED BY t, conn  codepre  pWhich should alter the dates in the line save it to a txt file then insert it to the table and loop round for each row.

Or my methods are far too long winded and involve having to tables and a massive sql insert listing all 24 of the columns and values. p  pstrongMy Pointstrongp  pSo I was wondering if I could in a way explode the entire array which contains the file lines and mass substr from the dates, then restore it back to the old array lines format put that back in the file and just  LOAD DATA INFILE from that. As loading the original file works, but the dates cant be as date type because theyre 20130311T2035330000 for example.p  pAlso if there is a way to simply insert a variable which as t deliberated values inside without having to make it an array and state eachColumnandValue[2] thatd be even better.p  pMany thanks.p

Nothing we store in the Session is critical, it is just used for performance.

Negative 572 pI would need to add a textfield and a button to be shown over a tableview or to pull down the tableview and show a textfield and a button above the tableview.

I plan on identifying the columns with a name that will be linked to another name in a table as well again, out of my control. p  pFor example in CSV p  precodeName1           Name2      Name3 1                3           2 22               4           3 3                13          12 41               8           1 22               6           4 codepre  pIn metadata table p  precodeNames         ID       Name1         ID1            Name2         ID2            Name3         ID3          codepre  pAnd the table I want to create via import p  precodeID1           ID2      ID3 1             3         2 22            4         3 3             13        12 41            8         1 22            6         4 codepre  pThe issue being that the names of the columns wont always be in the same order, any given day I could be given a CSV that would look like this p  precodeName3         Name2        Name1 2               3           1 3               4           22 12              13          3 1               8           41 4               6           22 codepre  pHow would you go about naming via something like an innerjoin, the columns in the tablep

Negative 572 pCurrently I am working on increasing performance for zip code search for a client. Their websites are simply brute force searching through an xml file. The plan is to build a BTree to make the search faster. Though I am confused on how to properly implement this.p  pMy current thought is to build a library with an object that, when created, builds the BTree from the xml file. Though this requires rebuilding the BTree every time a customer accesses the website. All of my searching keeps leading into data serialization, but that seems to be barking up the same tree. Is deserializing a database quicker than rebuilding itp  pSorry, if this question is too open ended let me know and Ill edit it appropriately. p

Negative 572 pI want to extend an existing PHP tool which provides automatic CRUD forms for a Database. I want to introduce the possibility to add completely custom php pages sort of feature extensions. I want to keep the solution as easy as possible, I was thinking about implementing the feature in the following wayp  ul lithe userdeveloper adds a new page from an admin menu, specifying the PHP source file name e.g. myfileli lithe system automatically adds a menu item link for this new pageli lithe system, when a custom php page link is clicked, just loads the file something like requires .customfiles.myfile..phpli ul  pWhat security issues can you see in this approach The first issue to handle is the fact that the userdeveloper could use variable names which are used by the system itself, and this can of course lead to problems. In order to handle this aspect, I was thinking about forcing the userdeveloper to use specific variable names once you have chosen a prefix, e.g. customvars, the user can just modify variables starting with that prefix, e.g. customvarsa, customvarstest, POST[customvarstest2] and so on. In this way I will be sure to avoid conflict.p  pIs there any way to avoid the modification of variables whose names dont start with the specified stringp  pI know the solution is a bit hacky and not very elegant but I need an implementation very quickly.p

Google normally uses ISO 8601 time format YYYYMMDDThhmmTZD eg 19970716T19200100 and this works just fine. However, for All Day events the format is only in the form YYYYMMDD eg 19970716 Which is allowed by W3 a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRNOTEdatetime relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTRNOTEdatetimea and in this case codenew Datecode will interpret this as GMT. This is, will correct that particular date to your local time zone even if the event was already created in your local timezone.

Negative 572 pI have a codeListViewcode with a codeCustomAdaptercode that has up to 50 rows only 11 on the screen at once. Each row contains a codespinnercode and two codeEditTextcodes.

Negative 572 pHello and sorry if this is already answered, Ive searched for days and havent found an answer or know if its a good idea.p  pIm creating a site with PHP scripts that can return different pages. Im also using modrewrite now to create clean URLs. For example, I have a script strongmyscript.phpstrong and in it it would return strongpage1strong, strongpage2strong, or strongpage3strong depending on some parameters. That works.p  pThe url would always be strongmysite.commyscript.phpstrong but the output would be 3 different pages.p  pThen I apply modrewrite, and the url is now strongmysite.compublicnamestrong. Great, but now the problem is I want the three different pages to display as strongmysite.compublicname1strong, strongmysite.compublicname2strong, strongmysite.compublicname3strong.p  pSince this requires pushing a different URL to the browser I must use a redirect to another script of this name Is there a better way or best practice to doing this What are the browser and device support issues with this Should I design my site differently that I dont do any redirects, or are PHP Location redirects well supported and ok in building a sitep  pThank you for your helpp

Negative 572 pI am looking for a few ideas on how can I solve a design problem Im going to be faced with building a web scraper to scrape multiple sites.  Writing the scrapers is not the problem, matching the data from different sites which may have small differences is.p  pFor the sake of being generic assume that I am scraping something like this from two or more different sitesp  precode    public class Data          public int id         public String firstname         public String surname         ....      codepre  pIf i scrape this from two different sites, I will encounter the situation where I could have the followingp  pSite A id100, firstnameWilliam, surnameDoep  pSite B id1974, firstnameBill, surnameDoep  pEssentially, I would like to consider these two sets of data the same they are the same person but with their name slightly different on each site.  I am looking for possible design solutions that can handle this.p  pThe only idea Ive come up with is scraping the data from a third location and using it as a reference list.  Then when I scrape site A or B I can, over time, build up a list of failures and store them in a list for each scraper so that it can know if i find id100 then i know that the firstname will be William etc.  I cant help but feel this is a rubbish ideap  pIf you need any more info, or if you think my description is a bit naff, let me knowp  pThanks,p  pDMcBp

Negative 572 pIm on a shared server with multiple versions of Compass and Sass installed.p  pThe latest version of Compass 0.12.6, is dependent on Sass 3.2.19, where 3.3.8 is the newest version installed on the machine.p  pCSS compilation is dependent on grunt amp gruntsasscontrib.p  pIm looking for a way to specify either the version of Sass, or the version of Compass to use in the Grunt build process.p  pI have tested the latest prerelease version of Compass and this works fine codecompass install precode, but cannot install this globally, as other projects are dependent on the previous version.

In order to bypass this, I added the following codep  precodeinput  [input stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfStringcleverweed withStringsmartweed] codepre  pNow, I know I dont have to do that to EVERY word that exists that has smart into it, so I changed the code to say thisp  precodeinput  [input stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString smart  withString clever ] codepre  pHey, that fixed it.

Negative 572 pI need to transfer a MongoDB query to a different system. For this reason I would like to use the a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencemongodbextendedjson relnofollowMongoDB Extended JSONa. I need this to be done mostly because I use date comparisons in my queries.p  pSo, the kernel of the problem is that I need to transfer a MongoDB query that has been generated in a emnode.jsem backend to another backend written in emGoem language.p  pIntuitively, the most obvious format for sending this query via emRESTem, is JSON. But, MongoDB queries are not exactly JSON, but BSON, which contains special constructs for dates.p  pSo, the idea is to convert the queries into JSON using a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencemongodbextendedjson relnofollowMongoDB Extended JSONa as form of representation of the special constructs. After some tests its clear that these queries do not work. Both the MongoDB shell and queries sent via emnode.jsems need the special codeISODatecode or codenew Datecode constructs.p  pFinally, the actual question are there functions to encodedecode from JSON to BSON, taking into account a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencemongodbextendedjson relnofollowMongoDB Extended JSONa, both in JavaScript node.js and emGoem languagep  h1Updatesh1  h2Node.js encoding packageh2  pApparently a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.orgpackagemongodbextendedjson relnofollowthere is a emnode.jsem packagea that parses and stringifies BSONJSON.

Negative 572 pI need two TransformerFactory implementations for my software. I must process xml and xlsfo formatting object for PDFs. For newer versions of our software where I want to use user defined xsl functions I use net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl which is directly referenced in the sourcecode. Because of old data in database in need to process the old ones with org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl, saxon would thrown an error and not render the PDF.p  pWhen using Tomcat I just set Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryorg.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl as vm argument and it was no problem.p  pWhen using Wildfly setting the vm argument causes wildfly to throw the following exception Exception in thread main javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError Provider org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl not foundp  pA xalan.jar is contained in my war file. A jboss specific version of xalan is part of the Wildlfy distribution.p  pWhy is none of them found Why does Wildfly even try to load the factory on startup of the wildfly service How do i configure Wildfly to find the xalan transformer factory during startup Writing a module entry into standalone.xml or domain.xml does not help.p  pI am aware that there is a bug in Wildfly saying the redirect of the transformer factory does not point to Wildfly transformer factory but to the java default. I think that should not have any influence on my problem because I try to set another default.p  pAny helpp

Negative 572 pIn IntelliJ IDEA, what variables like FILE or PAGE are allowed in the HeaderFooter fields when printingp
Negative 572 pIm attempting to use boost statechart to represent a command line program as a state machine. For the most part there is a 11 equivalence between user commands and state machine events, and the behaviour is synchronous. However one particular state is different. On entering, it needs to begin some asynchronous processing. There is only one possible transition away from this state, but it can be triggered either by a user command which must notify the async processing to stop, or by the processing reaching a natural termination. p  pIm unclear on how best to achieve this, or indeed if it is even a reasonable thing to be attempting with a state machine.p  pIt seems the processing of the special state should probably be done in a newly spawned thread. Doing it synchronously within the statechart event processing seems like an abuse of the design, and the code needed to interrupt on user command would likely be clumsy too.p  pAssuming I spawn a new thread, this thread then needs to post an event when the processing completes naturally. I think Im correct in saying that statepostevent can only be called from within a state reaction handler If so, I see 2 optionsp  ol lipI could set up a mechanism where the async thread sends a notification to the thread which is passing user commands to the state machine, and have it pass the event. This might be the most simple, but seems a bit of a hack and not very scalable.pli lipMaybe I should be using the asynchronousstatemachine class Since the async processing will be initiated from one of my states, is there some way of obtaining a handle to the scheduler from within the state machine contextpli ol

Negative 572 pIve come across some code that repeatedly checks the same condition. Seems like C 6 will absolve us from this ugly redundant code, but in the meanwhile, is there any benefit to introducing the bool variable, or is the compiler smart enough to sort this out for us  and not repeatedly compare the same things over and over even though were doing a check anyways, Ill assume stashing the result in a bool would be marginally fasterp  precode here were doing the same check over and over again string str1  CustomerData  null  string.Empty  CustomerData.str1 string str2  CustomerData  null  string.Empty  CustomerData.str2 string str3  CustomerData  null  string.Empty  CustomerData.str3  ... rinse and repeat   here were still doing a check, but against a boolean variable bool isvalid   CustomerData  null string str1  isvalid  string.Empty  CustomerData.str1 string str2  isvalid  string.Empty  CustomerData.str2 string str3  isvalid  string.Empty  CustomerData.str3  ... rinse and repeat codepre  pIn this case this might not be critical, but what happens if were comparing 2 objects which then need to go and deep check all the fields inside themp  pNote since this is inside a method, I couldnt rely on the default  value for strings codenullcode, so the workaround is creating all the strings, initializing them to  string.Empty, and then doing something like   p  precodeif CustomerData  null       set all of the above strings again, changing from empty to actual values    codepre

Negative 572 pUntil lately Ive been just changing the x coordinate of my sprite on each update and I was happy with it. But yesterday when being in the debugDraw mode, I found out that after certain speed physics body wouldnt align correctly with the sprite ,like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh21ME.png altenter image description here Later I got told that, by Birkemose in cocos2d forum the preferred way to move a physics body from A to B is to apply impulse to it.

This is the code I used to move it without applying any impulsep  precodevoidupdateCCTimedelta     rollingHero.positionccprollingHero.position.xscrollSpeeddelta,                              rollingHero.position.y     physicsNode.positionccpphysicsNode.position.xscrollSpeeddelta,                          physicsNode.position.y  codepre  pSo to create a feeling of moving I scroll the physics node and the hero in opposite directions with the same scrolling speed.  I tried lots of different variants of applying impulse, but I never got it moving with constant speed. The speed accelerates and the hero gets offscreen. I would appreciate it very much if someone would post a sample code.p

Negative 572 pI am the developer for an asp.net mvc site. Today, without warning, our  site suddenly stopped working.  When I checked the error logs I started to see a great deal of the following issuep  pThe model item passed into the dictionary is of type Volume, but this dictionary requires a model item of type Volume.p  pThis was repeated for every stronglytyped view that was being requested, even though the view was of the correct type In  For some reason, the views stopped accepting the models passed down from the controller, even though they were of the correct type.

Negative 572 pI was searching for this problem online, and it seems like Im the only one having this problem All other problems regarding Wordpresss Navbar are related to CSS and HTML.p  pHeres strongmystrong problem The only way to form a navigation menu in Wordpress is to use the visual dragndrop tool which is in Appearance  Menus. So far, I have used this tool to make my websites menus with no problem. But for my recent project, I have to put like 150 items in the menu. And the text is unicode Persian. As a result, the browser becomes very.... very slow while drag and dropping, and after 4 hours of arranging the items, I have got thisp  blockquote   pWarning Unknown Input variables exceeded 1000. To increase the limit   change maxinputvars in php.ini. in Unknown on line 0p blockquote  pI luckily found the solution for this error and increased the limit via my php.ini. But Once again, its showing a white screen after I press Save Menu. When I check my menu in the local host, it hasnt saved all the items and has been interrupted.p  pI was wondering.. is there any other way of making menus instead of dragdropping Something like putting all the data in an XML file or manipulating the menu items from Databasep  pRegarding this, I found a hrefhttpswordpress.orgsupporttopicwp30wherearemenuitemsandrelationshipsstored relnofollowan articlea which explains the structure of Wordpress menus in the DB. But I find it too complicated if I want to go though all the items one by one. I still believe theres an easier way to make this done. Any suggestion is appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATESstrong Alright, I made it work for this project. I increased the max execution time in php.ini and the interruption problem solved. Note To avoid wasting another 4 hours on this, after I finished the drag and drop for the first time, I copied the content of the codeltul classmenu uisortable idmenutoeditgtcode in a separate file, and replaced the new ones with it using inspect element tool... clever, ehp  pBut even though the problem is solved for me, the main problem still stands, which is an alternative to the visual tool. So, I keep this question open in case anyone comes with an answer.p

In order to test this, as part of the codeservercode function, I have included a function codeprintIndexcode in order to print the results of codeindexcode to make sure that it works properly. p  pI have personally tried printing the results of codeind.jcode, codeind.ccode, codeind.lcode,codeind.dcode, codeind.scode, and codeind.allcode each one individually to the console and they seemed to all produce the right results. However, when I test the results of codeindcode its not quite what I expect so Im wondering if its the reactivity or the line of code thats problematic. What the codeindcode intends to do is to take the list of all the lookedup indices, stored in codeind.allcode, and applies the codeintersectcode function recursively to find the common elements from all the sublists in codeind.allcode.p  pAs I mentioned above, the codeindexcode function works fine for individual filters. However, when I enter values for all the indices, as a user, the function does not update to the correct list of indices as expected. For example, you can try inputting application in the strongJobstrong textInput, Gas Drive Global in the strongCompanystrong selectizeInput, and Calgary in the strongLocationstrong textInput at the same time and hit strongSearchstrong. You will see that the data table does not return any results while this clearly corresponds to the 1st row of the dataframe codedfcode.p  precodeLoad required packages ListofPackages cshiny,ggplot2,scales lapplyListofPackages,require,character.onlyTRUE  Define the dataframe on which the search will be performed df lt data.frameJobcApplications Engineer  Gas Drive,                        Engineer, Operations,                        Project Engineer,                        Project Engineer Oil amp Gas,                        Project Engineer,                        Junior Engineer,                        Engineer, Operations,                        Research and Development RampD Junior Engineer,                        JUNIOR QUALITY ENGINEER,                        Junior Systems Design and Support Engineer,                        Mechanical Engineer Calgary, AB,                        Applications Engineer,                        Project Engineer,                        Pipeline Engineer,                        Development Engineer,                        Specialist Engineering Finance,                        Mechanical Engineer  Sudbury,                        Project Cost Analyst 12 month term,                        Project Controls Functional Analyst,                        Project Controls Professionals,              CompanycGas Drive Global,                        Agrium Wholesale,                        City of Calgary,                        Stantec,                        Shell,                        Canadian National Railway,                        Pembina Pipeline Corporation,                        Velan Inc.,                        G.W.

The implementation was very messy I included, in my main keybindings, something likep  precodew, spawn xdotool key ltchordmodewkeybindinggt  sleep 0.05  xdotool key ltabortkeybindinggt chordmodewkeybinding, chordmodew codepre  pfor detecting kbdwkbd the rest would be similar, along with incomplete submaps such asp  precode chordmodew  submap . mkKeymap c                [                       e,  chordmodewe                      , f,  chordmodewf                      , abortkeybinding, pasteString w                       in order for the submap to not eat all other letters,                      would need to include all mappings like                     , a, pasteString wa                     , b, pasteString wb                     ...               ]   chordmodewe  submap . mkKeymap c                 [                       f,  normalmode                      , abortkeybinding, pasteString we                        in order for the submap to not eat all other letters,                      would need to include all mappings like                     , a, pasteString wea                     , b, pasteString web                     ...                ]   chordmodewf  submap . mkKeymap c                 [                       e,  normalmode                      , abortkeybinding, pasteString wf                       in order for the submap to not eat all other letters,                      would need to include all mappings like                     , a, pasteString wfa                     , b, pasteString wfb                     ...                ] codepre  pA complete implementation would evidently have been very messy, but in theory should have sent me to codenormalmodecode if I pressed wef within 0.05 seconds of each other, aborting and typing out the characters otherwise.  There were two problems, howeverp  ol lipcodepasteStringcode as well as the other paste functions in codeXMonad.Util.Pastecode is too slow for normal typingpli lipI would end up in codenormalmodecode only a small fraction of the time even if I set the abort delay much higher.  Not sure of the reason behind this.pli ol  pThe reason I used codepasteStringcode when aborting instead of spawning another codexdotoolcode was that output of codexdotoolcode would retrigger one of the codechordmodewkeybindingcode, codechordmodeekeybindingcode, codechordmodefkeybindingcode, back in the main keybindings, sending me back to the chord modes indefinitely.p

Negative 572 pWe use Jenkins and PHPUnit in our development. For long time I wanted to start to use executable requirements in our team. Architectteam leadersomeone who defines requirements can write tests before actual code. Actual code then should be written by another team member. Therefore executable requirements tests are committed to repository before actual code is made, Jenkins rebuilds the project and rightfully fails. And project remains in failed state until new code is written which defeats XP rule to keep project in good state at all times.p  pIs there any way to tell PHPUnit that such and such tests should not be run under Jenkins while they may be executed locally by any dev with ease Tweaking phpunit.xml is not really desirable local changes to tests are better as they easier to keep track of.p  pWe tried markTestIncomplete and markTestSkipped but they not really do what we need executable requirements tests are really complete and should not be skipped. Use of these functions prevent easy execution of such tests in development.p  pThe best approach in our case would be to have PHPUnit option like donotrunrequirements which should be used by PHPUnit executed by Jenkins. On dev machine this option should not be used and actual executable requirements tests should have executableRequirements metacomment in the beginning removed only after actual code is created and tested. Issue that PHPUnit does not have such functionality.p  pMay be there is a better way to achieve implementation of executable requirements without false failures in Jenkinsp

Negative 572 pI have a linear program with no objective function. So I just want to test its feasibility. I am using GLPK api for simplex to do that.

However, when I use the method GLPDUALP, after a few iterations I get the message Warning dual degeneracy switching to primal simplex and it goes on to converge in a reasonable number of iterations.p  pSo my question is if it ultimately uses the primal simplex in both cases, why does it not converge in the first case.

Negative 572 pXcode 6 never gets past Loading when I try to create a new project. I actually was able to create a new project yesterday, but I decided to just ditch it completely deleted. Clearly there must be a bad file somewhere, possibly related to the project I deleted, since I also see the same stalling behavior now with Xcode 5.1, which has worked fine for creating new projects in the past. Xcode 6 has worked fine when starting with an already existing project and still appears to do so. I did not see this exact problem in your data base, though one person saw the project creation freeze before reaching the stage I get to. Their solution was to delete Xcode and every possible file related to it, which Im a little squeamish about, since I dont want to affect existing projects, and dont have an understanding of what the various files are for.p

Negative 572 pI was thinking of using python to create a remote desktop program. There will be two parts to it, a server and a client. The server creates a connection between the client, the client then takes screenshots every second or so, and sends them to the server. The server displays those screenshots, and mouse movements over the screenshots get translated to coordinates and get sent to the client. Mouse clicks and key presses, will also be sent to the client. This will effectively allow the server to control the client remotely. Obviously it will be a bit laggy, but will it workp  pThanksp

Negative 572 pI built a custom transition manager to deal with moving views around spatially in my app.p  pI have three view controllers codeMainViewControllercode, codePastSessionsViewControllercode and codeJournalViewControllercode. p  pMy problem is When the user goes from Main to Past Sessions to Journal and presses Done in Journal to back to Main, the view jumps immediately to Past Sessions before Main zooms in from the right. p  pThe intended behavior is for Main to push in from the left side of the screen and push Journal off the right side of the screen.p  pI added a line break in codeanimationControllerForDismissedControllercode and noticed that codedismissed.descriptioncode is codePastSessionsViewControllercode when it should be codeJournalViewControllercode when moving from Journal to Main after pressing Done.p  pIm not sure why that is. I have the unwind segues wired up correctly and my code in codeprepareForSeguecode in codeJournalViewControllercode makes sense.  I dont believe I should need to define the dismissing view controller, this should be handled for me like it is in every other transition. p  pIf anyone has any ideas on how to fix this so that Past Sessions doesnt jump back into the users view before the transition, thatd be hugely appreciated.p  pThanksp  pstrongTransitionManager.swiftstrongp  precodeimport UIKit  class TransitionManager

It can be assumed that the array or some data structure is sorted.p  pA naive algorithm would be to loop through the starting element to the ending element and add a value v to each element. p  pBut that takes On time in the worst case when the range is from the first to last element. Is there a faster way to do this Should I use segment tree to do itp

Negative 572 pPlease note that this questions was edited after a couple of comments I received. Initially I wanted to split my goal into smaller pieces to make it simpler and perhaps expand my knowledge on various fronts, but it seems I went too far with the simplicity . So, here I am asking the big question.p  pUsing bash, is there a way one can actually create an anonymous pipe between two child processes and know their pidsp  pThe reason Im asking is when you use the classic pipeline, e.g.p  precodecmd1  cmd2 amp codepre  pyou lose the ability to send signals to cmd1. In my case the actual commands I am running are thesep  precode.mywebserver  .mylogparser amp codepre  pmywebserver is a basic web server that dump a lot of logging information to its stdout mylogparser is a log parser that I wrote that reads through all the logging information it receives from mywebserver and it basically selects only certain values from the log in reality it actually stores the whole log as it received it, but additionally it creates an extra csv file with the values it finds.p  pThe issue I am having is that mywebserver actually never stops by itself it is a web server, you dont want that from a web server . So after I am done, I need to stop it myself. I would like for the bash script to do this when I stop it the bash script, either via SIGINT or SIGTERM.p  pFor something like this, traps are the way to go. In essence I would create a trap for INT and TERM and the function it would call would kill mywebserver, but... I dont have the pid and even though I know I could look for it via ps, I am looking for a pretty solution .p  pSome of you might say Well, why dont you just kill mylogparser and let mywebserver die on its own with SIGPIPE. The reason why I dont want to kill it is when you kill a process thats at the end of the pipeline, the output buffer of the process before it, is not flushed. Ergo, you lose stuff.p  pIve seen several solutions here and in other places that suggested to store the pid of mywebserver in a file. This is a solution that works. It is possible to write the pipeline by fiddling with the filedescriptors a bit. I, however dont like this solution, because I have to generate files. I dont like the idea of creating arbitrary files just to store a 5character PID .p  pWhat I ended up doing for now is thisp  precodebinbash  trap   HUP  fifo mktemp u  basename 0 .XXXXXX  mkfifo fifo  ltfifo .mylogparser amp parserpid  gtfifo .mywebserver amp serverpid  rm fifo  trap 2gtdevnull kill TERM serverpid INT TERM  while true do   wait parserpid ampamp break done codepre  pThis solves the issue with me not being able to terminate mywebserver when the script receives SIGINT or SIGTERM. It seems more readable than any hackery fiddling with file descriptors in order to eventually use a file to store mywebservers pid, which I think is good, because it improves the readability.p  pBut it still uses a file named pipe. Even though I know it uses the file named pipe for mywebserver and mylogparser to talk which is a pretty good reason and the file gets wiped from the disk very shortly after its created, its still a file .p  pWould any of you guys know of a way to do this task without using any files named pipesp

I indexed the columns in the LEFT JOIN table and got fast times so I thought I was onto something, but after a few minutes back to 26 secs.  I readded the joins and sometimes the query is fast and sometimes slow  all with identical parameters, just running the same query over and over again, a few seconds apart.  Generally it seems after I made a change adding an index or removing a JOIN it would be very fast, then a minute later I would run it and it would take 26 secs again.p  pIn the end I can find no logical relationship between any changes I made to the query or indexes I added and speed.p  pSo my conclusion is it is not indexing or query complexity although in general simpler queries did run a bit faster.p  pLooking at the Activity Monitor is Mgmt Studio there is a panel labeled Recent Expensive Queries.

Negative 572 pIm working on an Android Application that transmits data to the app from an external arduino device via bluetooth. Right now, the app successfully transmits data when the correct fragment is open.p  pHowever, Im trying to extend functionality so that even if the user is on a different fragment, or the entire app is not open, the app still processes the bluetooth data.p  pI watched a a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvzCj5QzzexA relnofollowtutoriala on implementing android services, and it seems like I need to put all the relevant functions inside a codeServicecode class. However, instead of duplicating all the code in my fragment, Im wondering if theres a way to create a unified design so that I just have one set of functions for processing the data, whether the action needs to be performed in the background or not.p  pBelow are some of the functions in the relevant fragment that I use to communicate with bluetootharduino and process the data are listed below.p  precodepublic void onStart       super.onStart      getActivity.registerReceiverbluetoothStateReceiver, new IntentFilterBluetoothAdapter.ACTIONSTATECHANGED      getActivity.registerReceiverrfduinoReceiver,   RFduinoService.getIntentFilter      updateStatebluetoothAdapter.isEnabled  STATEDISCONNECTED  STATEBLUETOOTHOFF   public void onPause      super.onPause     getActivity.unregisterReceiverbluetoothStateReceiver     getActivity.unregisterReceiverrfduinoReceiver    void bluetoothConnect       bluetoothAdapter  BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter     if Connected  false              onStart         bluetoothAdapter.startLeScannew UUID[]  RFduinoService.UUIDSERVICE , MyEatingFragment.this              public void onLeScanBluetoothDevice device, final int rssi, final byte[] scanRecord           bluetoothAdapter.stopLeScanthis         bluetoothDevice  device          getActivity.runOnUiThreadnew Runnable              Override             public void run                  if bluetoothDevice.getName.containsCONSTANTS.CONNECTIONSTRING                                  Intent rfduinoIntent  new IntentgetActivity,RFduinoService.class                 getActivity.bindServicerfduinoIntent, rfduinoServiceConnection, 1                                               private final BroadcastReceiver bluetoothStateReceiver  new BroadcastReceiver  public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      int state  intent.getIntExtraBluetoothAdapter.EXTRASTATE, 0      if state  BluetoothAdapter.STATEON              upgradeStateSTATEDISCONNECTED          else if state  BluetoothAdapter.STATEOFF              downgradeStateSTATEBLUETOOTHOFF          private ServiceConnection rfduinoServiceConnection  new ServiceConnection  Override public void onServiceConnectedComponentName name, IBinder service      Log.dBT, in started service     rfduinoService  RFduinoService.LocalBinder service.getService     if rfduinoService.initialize          boolean result  rfduinoService.connectbluetoothDevice                 .getAddress          if result  true              upgradeStateSTATECONNECTING                  Override public void onServiceDisconnectedComponentName name      Log.dBT, in service disconnected     rfduinoService  null     downgradeStateSTATEDISCONNECTED    private final BroadcastReceiver rfduinoReceiver  new BroadcastReceiver  Override public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      final String action  intent.getAction      if RFduinoService.ACTIONCONNECTED.equalsaction          Toast.makeTextgetActivity, Connected to sensor,                 Toast.LENGTHLONG.show         Log.dBT, in myeating, connected         upgradeStateSTATECONNECTED      else if RFduinoService.ACTIONDISCONNECTED.equalsaction          downgradeStateSTATEDISCONNECTED      else if RFduinoService.ACTIONDATAAVAILABLE.equalsaction          addDataintent.getByteArrayExtraRFduinoService.EXTRADATA        codepre

Negative 572 pI need to create a deployment rule set which decides whether an application webstart or applet will be executed using Java 1.6.031 or 1.8.045. Initially I want to use 1.6.031 for all internally developed applications and then gradually use 1.8.045 for specific applications that are proven compatible with Java 8. Since all those applications are signed using our own certificate, my idea was to use this certificate as a criterion in the rule set. Here is my initial configurationp  precodeltruleset version1.0gt   ltrulegt     ltid titleMy Java 8 compatible applicationgt         ltcertificate hashmycertificatehashgt     ltidgt     ltaction permissionrun version1.8.045 forcetruegt   ltrulegt   ltrulegt     ltidgt         ltcertificate hashmycertificatehashgt     ltidgt     ltaction permissionrun version1.6.031 forcetruegt   ltrulegt   ltrulegt     ltid gt     ltaction permissiondefaultgt   ltrulegt ltrulesetgt codepre  pFor webstart applications this configuration works just as I would expect. Unfortunately I am experiencing problems when it comes to applets. When I launch an applet in the browser, an error message claims that the required Java version 1.6.031 is not installed. This behaviour can be reconstructed in Firefox as well as Internet Explorer. I tried my luck with 1.6, 6, 1.6 and many more as value for the version attribute in the rule set but nothing worked. The last thing I tried was adding this rule to the top of my rulesetp  precodeltrulegt   ltid locationmyservergt   ltaction permissionrun version1.6.031 forcetruegt ltrulegt codepre  pAnd suddenly my applet launched and it used Java 6.p  pDoes anybody have an idea why my initial configuration did not work for the applet I am really trying to understand how the deployment rule set mechanisms work and what my mistake was in the initial configuration.p

Negative 572 pI need to copy a number of large files and report progress back to the UI via a progress bar. p  pI bought C 5.0 in a Nutshell. Im on page 597. I have been reading about parallel programming. I am trying to accomplish what in my mind is quite simple based on some examples in this book, but Im really struggling. There must be some gaps in my understanding. This is why Im posting this question.p  pI have looked into background workers, but find myself running into crossthreading compiler errors when I try to get progress.p  pIve looked into async commands but find myself misunderstanding lambda expressions. That, or how to actually execute the tasks code asynchronously from a button click, while still reporting progress back to the UI thread. p  pI have poured over many of the existing questionsanswers here, on MSDN, codeproject, asked a few questions myself here and had them downvoted. I just need one simple example I can wrap my brain around and Ill be well on my way. p  pIm confident that my answer is in async, Task.Run, File.Copy maybe StreamReaderStreamWriter classes and IProgress. The questions  answers Ive found in my two weeks of research and trial and error are either incomplete, or too broad  too specific for some given scenario.p  pI just need one working example of a UI with a progress bar, and a button that executes code in a new thread to copy a set of large files or just one large file and reports back progress. From there, I can play with it and tweak it to my needs and further my overall understanding.p  pstrongCode adapted from Clints answer, but still not updating progress correctlystrongp  pThis adaptation copies the file in an asynchronous task but updates progress from 0 to 100 only after the file has copied. Because Im working with large files, processing progress based on number of files is not sufficient.p  pSo far, nothing I have found or tried addresses performing a copy asynchronously whilst updating the byte for byte progress age of a large file. p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.ComponentModel using System.Data using System.Drawing using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Windows.Forms using System.Threading.Tasks using System.IO  namespace CopyProgressWorking      public partial class Form1  Form              public Form1                      InitializeComponent              string srcFile  CtempBigFile.txt             string dstFile  Ctemptemp2BigFile.txt             button1.Click  s, e gt DoCopysrcFile, dstFile                   public async Task CopyFilesDictionaryltstring, stringgt files, Actionltintgt progressCallback                      for var x  0 x lt files.Count x                              var item  files.ElementAtx                 var from  item.Key                 var to  item.Value                  using var outStream  new FileStreamto, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read                                       using var inStream  new FileStreamfrom, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read                                               long size  inStream.Position                         Console.WriteLineFilesize is 0, size                         await inStream.CopyToAsyncoutStream                                                         progressCallbackintx  1  files.Count  100                                public async void DoCopystring srcFile, string dstFile                      label1.Text  Copying   srcFile             await CopyFilesnew Dictionaryltstring, stringgt                              srcFile, dstFile             ,             prog gt                              InvokeMethodInvokerdelegate                      progressBar1.Value  prog                     if prog gt 100                                              label1.Text  Copy complete                                                                   codepre

Negative 572 pWe are using Gitblit as our source repository and TeamCity 8.0.6 for our Continous Integration. Periodically we see old commits show up as recent on TeamCity. See the image below to demonstrate the issue. All commits are to master, yet TeamCity clearly knows something is up as it visually shows them as a different branch albeit one that never joins up with the true master. p  pIn the example below the top commit is from 21st July 2015, yet the next 20 odd commits are from December to May 2015. After this, TeamCity then goes back to the correct next commit on the 20th July 2015.p  pFrom viewing our gitblit repository all the commits are in the correct sequence, so it looks like the issue is at TeamCitys end.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comvpR2w.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvpR2w.png altenter image description hereap
Negative 572   pIm working on a python code where I need to evaluate a 2D spline at an arbitrary set of points many times. The code looks like thisp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodespline  scipy.interpolate.RectBivariateSpline... for i in range1000000     xpoints, ypoints  data.getoutputpointsi     vals  spline.evxpoints, ypoints      do stuff with vals  codepre  pThere is no overlap of the output points. I would like to parallelize this using threads or some kind of shared memory since codedata.getoutputpointscode uses a lot of memory. Naively, I tried spawning 10 threads and giving them each 110 of that loop. However, this doesnt give me any speedup over running with a single thread.p  pI profiled the code, and it is spending all of its time in codefitpack2.py674callcode, which is the codeBivariateSplineBasecode evaluation function. It seems like Im running into some GIL issue which is preventing the threads from running independently.p  pHow can I get around the GIL issue and parallelize this Is there a way to call into the codefitpackcode routines that will parallelize well, or a different spline that I could use My input grid is uniform and oversampled, but my output points can be anywhere. I have tried using codeRegularGridInterpolatorcode linear interpolation which has good enough, although not ideal, performance, but it parallelizes poorly using threads.p  pEDIT Here is what I mean by naive thread parallelizationp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodedef workerstart, end     for i in rangestart, end         xpoints, ypoints  data.getoutputpointsi         vals  spline.evxpoints, ypoints          do stuff with vals   t1  threading.Threadtargetworker, args0, 500000.start t2  threading.Threadtargetworker, args500001, 1000000.start t1.join t2.join codepre

Negative 572 pIs there a way I can set a property by identifying it using a stringp  pFor example, I have a Visibility property that looks something like thisp  precodepublic Visibility ModifyFilesIconVisibility                      get  return modifyFilesIconVisibility              set                              SetPropertyref modifyFilesIconVisibility, value,  gt ModifyFilesIconVisibility                       codepre  pwhich is bound to an icon in XAML.

Negative 572 pI want the toolbar and imageview to collapse, when the user scrolls up. Since Im not using a recyclerview, a suggested workaround was to wrap the imageview in a NestedScrollView. p  pAll of the content below the AppBarLayout, is made up of imageviews, textviews, and many kinds of layouts.

Negative 572 pbr I seek for help on an issue where I observe a massive amount of malformed packet TNS observed with wireshark version 1.12.06 while selecting data from an Oracle Database 12c Release 12.1.0.1.0  64bit Production.brI can select the data, but the performance is misserable slow. I can reproduce this with an c application using oracle .net driver, from within R using RODBC and from the sqlplus command. However, using the Oracle SQL Developer studio seems to not produce this malfomred packets on the network and, hence, the performance is as I would expect.br The background of my question is the fact that the performance of codeSELECTcode was very very poor. I observed that the workstation was retriving data at 10 Bits and sending data with 6 MBits doing an codeSELECTcode . This turned my attention to the network layer. I admit that I am new to oracle an i needed some time to figure out what driver needs to be insalled. Further I did uninstall oracle drivers several times and can not exclude the possibility that my setup is somehow broken. I do not want to configure tnsnames.ora, instead I want to configure the clients using connectionstrings and codeEZCONNECTcode.br I appreciate any help how to further debug this issue.p  pThanks Janp

Negative 572 pIm trying to adopt BDD in my organization and since C.Net is our primary mode of development, Specflow is our best bet for anything Cucumber.p  pHowever, Ive been a Spring aficionado in the past, but at my company were using Autofac for various parts of the application. However, Im unable to find any resources that explain how Autofac can be used to trigger Specflows BDD tests and provide the necessary wiring of dependencies.p  pI plan to have Autofac be responsible for instantiating, wiring and executing everything instead of executing Specflow and have methods calling Autofac littered everywhere i.e., using Autofac as a Service Locator instead of a DIIoC Container. Can this even be done or am I looking at it the wrong way and there is a better way of achieving the same goal Or should I purely rely on Specflows internal container for DI and forget about Autofac altogetherp  pPossible approachesp  ol liHave Autofac instantiate and wire everything and run Specflow tests not sure if this is even possiblerecommended.li liHave Specflow globally instantiate Autofac which is wired with the necessary dependencies for the remainder of the code.

Negative 572 pHi Im wondering if anyone has run into this problem before. Im trying edit my websites css so I can display all the contents of the site, including the header and the footer inside a frame on the background image. Im using the backgroundsize cover for the the full screen responsive background and have set up padding on the body to place the content with the frame. This works but the only problem is, using the cover keyword results in the background image being stretched or some of the edges being cut off, making the area of the inside frame vary a lot as the screen size is changed. This makes it difficult to position the content exactly with the frame at different screen sizes, which Im trying to achieve to make the site responsive. I have  tried using media quires, but cant seem to find the right set, with the right breakpoints.

Negative 572 pAppLocker allows to restrict access to windows installer files code.msicode based on publisher, path, and usergroup. For example, the default rules restrict access to MSI to members of the Administrators group.p  pMSI has its own security mechanism the configuration step runs as unprivileged user, only when installation starts, privilege elevation is requested.p  pThe problem is now that AppLocker does not allow the unprivileged steps to run, forcing the user to install MSI files with Administrators privilege from the beginning.p  pAm I missing something Is there a way to restrict access with AppLocker based on user or group without disabling privilege seperation built into windows installerp

Negative 572 pHi I am very new to programming. Managed to make a helpful program last month and am now onto slightly bigger things DataGridviews are hurting my head. My Datagridview is not bound to a Database. In short i have two DataGridviews on two different forms one is essentially a Dictionary and the other is a Data Entry Sheet a bit like excel. The DataEntry Datagrid Cross references the Dictionary Datagrid. I have got this working however what i need to do is  if the data cell in the data entry sheet is not in the dictionary after editing then it will not go to another cell IE. stuck in that cell until a correct dictionary value is added. I can currently make it say msgboxnot in dictionary however my code for not allowing moving out of the cell is not working p  pHere is the codep  precodePrivate Sub dataGridView1CellEndEditByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellEventArgs  Handles DataGridView1.CellEndEdit       Dim Row As Integer  DataGridView1.CurrentRow.Index     Dim temp As Integer  0      Try         For i As Integer  0 To FormGeoDicLith.DataGridViewDicLith.RowCount  1  this code references a column in the datagrid dictionary to see if the correct value has been added to the data entry datagrid              If DataGridView1.RowsRow.Cells2.Value  FormGeoDicLith.DataGridViewDicLith.Rowsi.Cells1.Value Then                 MsgBoxItem found                 temp  1             End If         Next          If temp  0 Then  this is the problem area             DataGridView1.RowsRow.Cells2.Selected  True              MsgBoxCode Not In Dictionary              Exit Sub          End If     Catch ex As Exception      End Try End Sub   codepre  pThe problem is DataGridView1.RowsRow.Cells2.Selected  True although it looks like it selects the cell then it just unselects and I am not stuck in the cell like i want to be until a correct dictionary item is entered.

Negative 572 pMy background is primarily C and Java with a smattering of other things, and have started working on a project in C.  My exact task is generating a set of objects from a configuration file that is, read the file, determine what sort of object to create, add it to a list, repeat.

From various places I have read,p  ul liI should use pointers so that the polymorphism works correctlyli liC pointers should almost never actually be needed because theyre not necessary, automatic pointers are almost always better when you do need them, and usually you can use references insteadli liLarge codestructcodes such as classes should be passed by reference rather than copied around and returned from functionsli liIts totally fine to return full objects in Cli ul  pIts beginning to feel a little like C wants me to use the memory practices of Java using the tools of C, and its really not working.  At this point Im getting quite tempted to throw any kind of best practices involving automatic memory allocation out the window and litter my code with codecodes, but Id like to hear if theres a right way of doing this first.p
