Positive 631 pI know that codeSelect[]code is some sort of Mathematica function that works with lists. However, I need to be able to grab each element by name into a variable so that I can use it just like in a codeForEachcode loop.p  pBelow, you can see that I converted one of my loops into a codeSelectcode, but I have two more nested ones. Mathematica states that it has full procedural potential, but it does not have the codeForEachcode loop, which makes it much more difficult to operate do more than one functionaction on each element in some given loop.p  pEven if this could be converted into a functional list to be printed after, Id rather have something that can print as it finds applicable graphs. Notice that I break functional purity in areas random and printing and I would also like to even break out of the loop if an adjacent vertex is found that invalidates the tested one.p  pThe algorithm that I want to do will loop through a large number of times where it is not necessarily expected to stop before interesting results are reported where the example has 5 currently. Produce a random graph and find out if it has a vertex with eccentricity 1 more than the radius while not being adjacent to one with eccentricity radius. If it has this property, it is printed.p  precodeFor[x  0, x lt 5, x  x  1,  n  RandomInteger[1, 10]  m  RandomInteger[n  1, n  n  1  2]  G  RandomGraph[n, m]  R  Radius[G]  V  VertexList[G]  P  Select[V, R  1  VertexEccentricity[G, ]]  ForEach [p, P,   N  AdjacencyList[G, p]   test  true   ForEach[n, N,    If[VertexEccentricity[G, n]  R,      test  false      ]    ]   If [test  true,    Print[G]    ]   ]  ] codepre

Positive 631 pI really feel like Im missing something simple, so I apologize in advance for even having to ask. In Rebol how do you get a string value from a wordvariable in a block I have this codep  precodeREBOL [] aLink httpgoogle.com anAtt href aList [anAtt aLink] print Test 1 foreach el aList [ print type el ] print Test 2 foreach el2 aList [ print el2] print Test 3 foreach el2 aList [ print string el2] codepre  pThat returns thisp  precodeTest 1 word word Test 2 anAtt aLink Test 3 string string codepre  pWhat Id like up in Test 2 is for it to return the values of aLink and anAtt, but in every combination it returns the word name. What am I doing wrong Im doing this in REBOLCore 2.7.8.4.2 on 32bit Ubuntu using the 2.3 libc binary.p  pIve used foreach and blocks in other Rebol programs before and never had this trouble. Helpp
Positive 631 pI have been having an issue lately with a Foreach statement and it throwing an codeCollection was modified enumeration operation may not executecode exception when changing a variable that shouldnt impact the items being enumerated upon, but it still does. Here is my code so I can continue my explanationp  precode    private static CEconTradeOffer RemoveUndesirablesCEconTradeOffer offer              try                      CEconTradeOffer returned  offer             foreach CEconAsset cEconAsset in offer.ItemsToReceive                              string marketHashName  cEconAsset.GetMarketHashNameconfig.ApiKey                 if marketHashName.ToLower.Containscase                      marketHashName.Containsgut                      marketHashName.Containsfalchion                      marketHashName.Containsbayonet                      marketHashName.Containshuntsman                      marketHashName.Containskarambit                      marketHashName.Containsbutterfly                                      somehow changes both offer and returned at once.                     returned.ItemsToReceive.RemovecEconAsset                     continue                                   MarketValue value  MarketHandler.GetPriceOverviewConvert.ToUInt32cEconAsset.AppId,                     marketHashName                 if value.Success  int.Parsevalue.Volume, NumberStyles.AllowThousands lt 20                     returned.ItemsToReceive.RemovecEconAsset                          return returned                  catch Exception e                      Write.Exceptione             return null               codepre  pThis function was designed to do exactly what it says remove undesired items from a trade offer. As you can see, I set codeCEconTradeOffer returnedcode equal to the passed argument of the same type named codeoffercode. Strangely enough, whenever I change something inside of codereturnedcode it causes the codeforeachcode statement to break even though I technically shouldnt be impacting codeoffer.ItemsToReceivecode in any way. codereturnedcode is what should be modified. When I use the debugger, I notice that BOTH codereturnedcode and codeoffercode get changed at the line codereturned.ItemsToReceive.RemovecEconAssetcode. Through my previous experience with C and browsing related problems, this should not be happening since I am creating a new variable that should be separate from codeoffercode. I have tried include setting codereturnedcode equal to a codenew CEconTradeOffercode and then setting it equal to codeoffercode but to no avail. In my research of this problem, I can only seem to find problems where people fail to create a new variable and modifying that in the codeforeachcode statement rather than the enumerated value.p  pIs there something blatantly obvious I am missing I do not quite understand why I am getting this particular issue when I create a separate variable to change inside the codeforeachcode statement.p  pI am not using more than one thread, so it cant be impacted outside of its own thread of execution.p  pThanks in advance.p
Positive 631 pI try to develop a simple comment system. The foreach row coderesultcode contains variables from a database named posts. p  pThe id of the postevery post is a list item that is AUTOINCREMENT and every post have a unique id, the author of the post and the comment become submitted to a file that insert the three values into a database named comments. p  pThe second foreach loop, codecommentscode, should show the comments when the user click the popup button. That does not works because the id codeltinput typehidden nameid idid valueltPHP echo row[id] gt typetext gtcode wont become right insertedcomments.php should do that. p  pThe result is that all comments become showed in every list item and not the only these comments who are e.g. at list item 2.

Negative 631 pIm developing a programming language, and in my programming language, Im storing objects as hash tables.  The hash function Im using is a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPearson5Fhashing relnofollowPearson Hashinga, which depends on a 256bit lookup table.  Heres the functionp  precodechar pearsonchar name, char lookup      char index  0     whilename              index  lookup[index  name]         name          return index  codepre  pMy question is, given a fixed group of fewer than 256 member names, how can one determine a codelookupcode table such that codepearsoncode will return unique characters within a contiguous range starting from code0code.  In other words, I need an algorithm to create a lookup table for a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPerfect5Fhash5Ffunction relnofollowperfect hasha.  This will allow me to have objects that take up no more space than the number of their members.  This will be done at compile time, so speed isnt a huge concern, but faster would be better.  It would be easy to brute force this, but I think hope theres a better way.p  pHeres an example given member variables foo, bar, and baz in a class, I want to determine a codelookupcode such thatp  precodepearsonfoo,lookup  char 0 pearsonbar,lookup  char 1 pearsonbaz,lookup  char 2 codepre  pNote that the order doesnt matter, so the following result would also be acceptablep  precodepearsonfoo,lookup  char 2 pearsonbar,lookup  char 0 pearsonbaz,lookup  char 1 codepre  pIn an ideal world, all names that arent in the table would return a value greater than 2 because this would allow me to avoid a check and possibly even avoid storing the member names, but I dont think this is possible, so Ill have to add an extra check to see if its in the table.  Given this, it probably would save time to not initialize values in the lookup table which arent used collisions dont matter, because if it collides and fails the check, it isnt in the object at all, so the collision doesnt need to be resolved only the error needs to be handled.p

I would think I could do it by overriding the Release, and if the object count  0 then call MyDispose.  But apparently Im not overriding Release correctly because my Release method is never called.p  pObviously, I can make this happen by putting my MyDispose method in the interface and requiring the people using my object to call MyDispose before Release, but it would be slicker if Release just cleaned up the object.p  pIs it possible to force the .NET COM objects destructor, or some other method, to be called immediately when a COM object is releasedp  pGoogling on this issue gets me a lot of hits telling me to call System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject, but of course, thats how you tell .NET to release a COM object.  I want COM Release to Dispose of a .NET object.p

Negative 631 pIm developing an HTTP api for our web application.  Initially, the primary consumer of the API will be an iPhone app were developing, but Im designing this with future uses in mind such as mobile apps for other platforms.  Im trying to decide on the best way to authenticate users so they can access their accounts from the iPhone.  Ive got a design that I think works well, but Im no security expert, so I figured it would be good to ask for feedback here.p  pThe design of the user authentication has 3 primary goalsp  ol listrongGood user experiencestrong We want to allow users to enter their credentials once, and remain logged in indefinitely, until they explicitly log out.  I would have considered OAuth if not for the fact that the experience from an iPhone app is pretty awful, from what Ive heard i.e. it launches the login form in Safari, then tells the user to return to the app when authentication succeeds.li listrongNo need to store the user creds with the appstrong I always hate the idea of having the users password stored in either plain text or symmetrically encrypted anywhere, so I dont want the app to have to store the password to pass it to the API for future API requests.li listrongSecuritystrong We definitely dont need the intense security of a banking app, but Id obviously like this to be secure.li ol  pOverall, the API is RESTinspired i.e. treating URLs as resources, and using the HTTP methods and status codes semantically.  Each request to the API must include two custom HTTP headers an API Key unique to each client app and a unique device ID.  The API requires all requests to be made using HTTPS, so that the headers and body are encrypted.p  h2Current strategyh2  pMy plan is to have an strongapisessions tablestrong in my database. It has a unique constraint on the API key and unique device ID so that a device may only be logged into a single user account through a given app as well as a foreign key to the users table.p  pThe API will have a strongloginstrong endpoint, which receives the usernamepassword and, if they match an account, logs the user in, creating an apisessions record for the given API key and device id.  Future API requests will look up the apisession using the API key and device id, and, if a record is found, treat the request as being logged in under the user account referenced by the apisession record.p  pThere will also be a stronglogoutstrong API endpoint, which deletes the record from the apisessions table.p  pDoes anyone see any obvious security holes in thisp

Negative 631 pIm very new to ObjectiveC and Cocoa but Ive made a simple app which uses ImageKit to present a slideshow using the IKSlideShow class.

Negative 631 pWe are having a real bizarre issue, where when we do a post, line endings are coderncode, but when we pull the value using javascript, it just gets codencode. This is causing issues, because for our system a create will be doing a normal form post, and a update will be pulling values from the form to build out an ajax request. Later, we are doing a string comparison on a given field, and are seeing this strange mix between codercode being there or not being there.p  pIE handles this fine ALWAYS coderncode, FF on windows will submit with coderncode, and in javascript will only report codencode. What is REALLY FREAKIN STRANGE though is that on linux, both firefox and chrome will post with coderncode, and doing a codedocument.getElementByIdtextareaid.valuecode will always show only codencode.p  pIs this some dusty corner of the HTTP spec or something like that Do the browsers implement this so that windows servers wont die Is there any way around it, then sanitizing every field What I would expect is both JS and HTTP POSTs to behave the same way, and use the system default on whatever system they happen to be on.p

Negative 631 pIm writing a parser for a templating language which compiles into JS if thats relevant. I started out with a few simple regexes, which seemed to work, but regexes are very fragile, so I decided to write a parser instead. I started by writing a simple parser that remembered state by pushingpopping off of a stack, but things kept escalating until I had a recursive descent parser on my hands.p  pSoon after, I compared the performance of all my previous parsing methods. The recursive descent parser was emby farem the slowest. Im stuck Is it worth using a recursive descent parser for something simple, or am I justified in taking shortcuts I would love to go the pure regex route, which is insanely fast almost 3 times faster than the RD parser, but is very hacky and unmaintainable to a degree. I suppose performance isnt emterriblyem important because compiled templates are cached, but is a recursive descent parser the right tool for every task I guess my question could be viewed as more of a philosophical one to what degree is it worth sacrificing maintainabilityflexibility for performance p

Negative 631 pId like to separate reusable code in Xcode 4 as a separate projectlibrarysomething else. The reusable code in this case is a game engine, and the main project is a game itself. Idea is to make the game engine code easy to use in the future projects.p  pXcode 4 lets me create a blank project or a static library for iOS. Which one would be preferred or would something else work better under KISS principle I just want to separate two logical set of files into two projects its ok if one is a child of another, and to be able to compile them at the same time. I dont have a need for obfuscation and Ive heard that with a static library one has to worry for which architecture it was built for, which sounds like an overkill.p  pI feel that a blank project might be better way to go than the static library, but I dont have any practical experience with this.

Negative 631 pI set up an interactive python environment in an application. I can input commands and they will execute inside it, having access to the variables that live there.p  pThe problem is that I coded a halfassed editor that allows only that. It doesnt have command history, code completion etc, because I didnt code a full IDE. However, I would like to be able to write code in that environment with a fancy editor.p  pThe way I think it can work out is that an editor will have an interfaceprotocol for remote python sessions, and I will just have to implement a server in my application instead of the simple editor and be able to connect and run code.p  pI can implement any interface or protocol that I have to, but I cant find an IDE that has such a protocol defined or an easy way to plug an extension that will serve as the client side.p  pEssentially, I want a python editor that has an option to call a function x whenever a command can be multiline finished typing, and another function y when an autocomplete request occurs. I checked out some editors but couldnt find such a feature. Does anyone know of such a thing It actually doesnt have to be a python editor, just support the hooks that i need.p  pThanksp

Negative 631 pWhat would be the fastest way to transmit SQL tabular data over HTTP using WCF endpointsp  pRight now I am querying Entity Framework with ESQL and then serializing the DataTable result into a byte[] and just sending that over, then deserializing on the other end, which seems slow. Right now the size of the serialized data is coming to about 4000 bytes for 15000 rows. I also experimented with OData Services but that was also rather slow.p  pIn contrast to JSON, which I would think would be the fastest  a JSON file that contains only 1048 SQL rows is coming up as almost 200000 bytes. Is there any direct correlation between the size of the data and how fast it will transfer over HTTP seems intuitive, but Im not positive. p  pWhat would be the fastest format I am thinking of going with SQLDataReader to JSON and send the JSON over, which I would think should perform well but Im not sure.

Negative 631 pI have an MVC 3.0 app.  My testing framework is nUnit 2.4.8.0.  I started this code on a 32 bit machine, and recently started using a 64 bit machine.  I just as recently upgraded the project to .NET 4.0.p  pMy application runs fine  I am able to hydrate my objects from the database appropriately.  The issue is when I run my integration tests.p  pThe tests fail, and give an exception Ive never seen before  p  precodeNHibernate.ADOException  cannot open connection   gt System.BadImageFormatException  An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format. Exception from HRESULT 0x8007000B codepre  pIve searched online for this exception  Its of course a problem with nUnit, despite the NHibernate exception remember, NHibernate allows me to hydrate and persist objects when I run the app.p  pI upgraded my nUnit assembly to the most recent release, version 2.5.10, and updated the reference in the project to the assembly under the net2.0 folder of the nUnit zip file.  I ran the tests again, and received the same exception.  p  pIt seems that there is some sort of 32bit vs 64bit conflict between assemblies, code, and the ASP.NET Development Server.p  pI dont have any experience dealing with 32bit vs 64bit issues, so I dont know if there are other questions on stack overflow that are relevant the ones Ive seen seem not to be.  I have some ideas, but no answersp  ul liDo I need a different nUnit assembly li liDo I need to change the Solution Platform setting in VS2010 Its currently on Any CPU li liDo I need to change build properties of my integration tests project li liDo I need to change configuration settings of my solutionli ul  pUnfortunately I dont have a 32bit machine around to test the code on at the moment.  Are any of the above questions on the right path to solving this  Can you offer any guidancep  pThanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Im really hoping to be able to run the tests from within Visual Studio using TestDriven.NET.  I dont want to have to start using the nunit UI to run my tests.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Sorry, I may not have been clear.  Im not yet using TestDriven.NET, what I said is that Im hoping to use it, but I havent installed it yet on the new x64 machine.  At this moment, Im trying to run the tests by clicking on the visual icon inside the Visual Studio IDE, as in the image belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comitFXm.png altnunit test fixturesp  pFollowing through with that action, the tests fail, and the dialog that pops up displays the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjcPYG.png altFailed testsp  pThat is the exception that I quoted up above.  There is no reference to assemblies that havent loaded.p  pAt first I didnt believe that the version of NHibernate 2.0.1.4000 I am using would matter I say this because the providers are able to return the desired objects from the database when the app is run.  However, When I debug the test, I see that the exception is being thrown in my provider.  When digging down a bit, It seems the source of this is my SQLite assembly.  But again, this is the same assembly that works when I run the project  why would it not work when I run the integration testsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkMaJj.png altexception detailsp

Negative 631 pI am creating a website where there are two user intefaces.  ONe for sellers and one for buyers.  Currently, I am storing these files under a folder e.g interfacesframe.php So for both cases the files are stored there.  p  pI am able to authenticate the user by checking the database for user type and making sure if its a buyer they only get to see buyer interface and if seller then seller interface.

Negative 631 pI have an codestdvectorcodelike class that is compiled with Visual C 2008. Theres a piece in that class where stored elements are moved  either the body is reallocated or an insertionpartial erasure is done. Now some types can just be codememmovecoded while others need to be copyconstructed at the new location, then destroyed at the original location.p  pCurrently theres a templated function that implements copyconstruct, then destroy and theres a specialization for each type that can be codememmovecoded. Id like to use Va hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms17719428vVS.9029.aspx relnofollowisual C 2008 support of type traitsa to simplify that task.p  pWhat I want is that for each POD codememmovecode is selected automatically. I dont mind if some types that can be codememmovecoded are moved using that templated function, but I cant tolerate the opposite situation  when a datatype that cant be codememmovecoded is codememmovecoded.p  pLooks like codeispodcode intrinsic will do, but MSDN says it returns codefalsecode for builtin types.

Negative 631 pIve been having trouble trying to communicate between PHP and my iOS application using AES encryption.  p  pSo far, Ive considered two methods of implementation.  The first was to use OpenSSL.br On the iOS side, I implemented in a way to mimic the code shown here a hrefhttpsaju.net.incodemiscopensslaes.c.txt relnofollowhttpsaju.net.incodemiscopensslaes.c.txta.p  pOn the PHP side, I took the generated key and IV from the iPhone and used it as input to the  PHP openssl encrypt.  p  pThe results differed in terms of the output...p  pI have also considered a hrefhttpiphonedevelopment.blogspot.com200902strongencryptionforcocoacocoatouch.html relnofollowhttpiphonedevelopment.blogspot.com200902strongencryptionforcocoacocoatouch.htmlap  pbut this SO post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6461419aescryptdecryptionbetweeniosandphpfixedAESCrypt decryption between iOS and PHP [FIXED]a deterred me.p  pThe project is not tied down to AES, it just seemed like a strong encryption algorithm that wouldnt be too hard to implement.  p  pMy basic question is what is the easiest way to implement a good encryption algorithm that can easily be used to communicate between iOS and PHPp

Negative 631 pIm running an imageheavy website hosted on Windows Azure. Backend performance is great but response times for image thumbnails, which make the bulk of page sizes, are quite volatile.

Negative 631 pInterestingly, it turns out this is almost impossible to do. Remapping kbdALTkbd key to behave as another kbdCTRLkbd key is not a solution because you lose the kbdALTkbd key functionalities some of which are essential, like kbdAltkbdkbdTabkbd.p  pSo how can I get a behavior similar to OSX where kbdCMDkbd key is used for keyboard shortcuts but also for switching between windows with kbdCMDkbdkbdTABkbdp  pI know I can assign kbdCTRLkbdkbdTabkbd to switch between windows after I remap kbdALTkbd key as a kbdCTRLkbd key. But then I lose the real kbdCTRLkbdkbdTABkbd functionality in some applications, which are also essential like switching between tabs. Basically my kbdCTRLkbd and kbdALTkbd keys would become the same key and it will be impossible to have two different set of shortcuts for these two modifier keys.p  pA good solution for me would probably be a way to catch kbdALTkbdkbdCkbd, kbdALTkbdkbdVkbd, kbdALTkbdkbdXkbd, etc. at the window management level and send instead a kbdCTRLkbdkbdCkbd or kbdCTRLkbdkbdVkbd or kbdCTRLkbdkbdXkbd etc. to the focused window. On Windows this was possible via AutoHotKey. p  pOn Linux, I heard about an application called AutoKey but unlike AutoHotKey you have to use a GUI to set the shortcuts. Since I will be writing almost all combinations of Alt manually, I dont want a GUI application do to this. I should be able to configure it by writing a text file.p  pIs it possible to achieve this either with Gnome or Xmonadp

Negative 631 pI will try to explain as best i can... Huge post coming as im not 100 where the problem lies. It probably has a really simple fix but im pulling hair at the min.p  pI have an abstract base class with a navigation property to a document type like sop  precodepublic abstract class Document Identity       public int DocumentTypeId  get set   this remains and alls good     public virtual DocumentType DocumentType  get set   this dissappears.  codepre  pThis DocumentType object contains a string value for the namespace for the type of object that it is.

Not the DocumentTypeId, that is there, but the actual DocumentType, I need to navigate into it to get the namespace value but it is missing.p  pIt now gets a bit more complicated.

If i refresh the page then the field is back again as Ninject and EF figures out that the Id is a foreign key that points to the DocumentType. p  pI could go and get the document type by the id that is in the Document obj and attach it back to the object before returing it to the view but i think that this would be terrible practise.p  pAny ideasp

Im using the a hrefhttpcode.google.complastfmjava relnofollowlastfmjava librarya that Last.fm recommends using.

Negative 631 pI have a small app using Drive.Info.  I want to do two things.  Check a certain drive exists on a machine, and if it does and todaysdate isnt one of a number of dates stored in a text file, run a small application. If todays date is read inside the text file, do nothing.  I Have a bunch of code working but having trouble with the DateTime object.  Can anyone take a look at what I have and advise what I need to restructure  All the logic is there, Im just not putting it together correctly.p  ol liDates stored in the txt file Im reading from are like so on each line 25122010.li liInside the catch statement the line Console.WriteLinee.Message is what is generating the  String was not recognised as a valid DateTime issue.li liMy desired goal is If todays date is NOT found in the text file amp The drive specified at the line d.Name.ContainsC exists on the current machine, run calc.exe.li liIf todays date IS found in the text file, do nothing.li ol  pMy issue is  How do I modify the structure of my application so I can compare dates successfully with those stored in the txt file.  And secondly, adjust my logic so I can achieve parts 3 amp 4 above.p  pApologies for needing to edit, I should have been more clear with my initial post. Thanks.p  pEDIT Guys Ive updated the code below.  It seems to be working now. Thanks for the help and sorry again for the poorly put together first question.

Negative 631 pDespite my background with asp .net C, Ive really tried to get my head around the different concepts and development techniques surrounding Sharepoint 2010 and I can honestly say Im really struggling. As a last resort  Im posting on here at the risk of being marked down on questions that you will say I could have found out through research myself but Ive been on this for days now believe me. So I have a few questions no doubt anybody proficient in Sharepoint will be able to help me find answers to. Please bare with me, if I could get answers to these questions it would help a GREAT dealp  pstrongStages of development in Sharepointstrongp  pI understand that in asp .net C and any other typical web design platforms we have the design stage were, as developers, well design the website and its content putting CMS to one side for now and then you have a view stage were endusers view the website  pretty simple. But with Sharepoint Im completely lost as to how I can view the lifecycle with regards to stages that it may go through. Im confused because Ive configured and set up my Sharepoint web app and a site collection. Thats fine, that seems like the admin side of things  but now the development is done how Ive followed a guide to assign master pages and css to the site collection for branding purposes but theres also the option to manage this site through the ribbon Do we want endusers to see this ribbon Basically, if anyone can clarify what responsibilities are left with the endusers after a handover from the developers it would help me a lot to grasp the concept of Sharepoint and what it offers. Also, does if Sharepoint is a CMS does this mean theres a 3rd stage to the lifecycle i.e. Sharepoint developers develop the framework for the site which will manage content, users will manage the content, another type of user will view the contentp  pstrongUse of VMsstrongp  pMy computers spec is now high enough to host VMs through hyperv, so it does. Im currently using a VM for Sharepoint development. Why If Id read around and found that the only reason was because Sharepoint cannot without fiddly hacks be ran on Windows 7 and I may need a win 7 vm for daytoday office use then Id understand  but it seems that VMs are also handy because should I mess up a sharepoint installation I can start again  why would I need to Ive never ever came accross any other type of installation apart from OS installations that could go wrong enough to require a complete restoration of a harddrive image. What exactly can go wrongp  pstrongManaging Sharepoint content in VSstrongp  pAgain, comparing to standard asp .net C development  I create my pages using master pages andor controls if I see fit and they appear, simple. With sharepoint  it seems that the content saved in a database which is automatically created by a Sharepoint installation is mapped to a page saved in our directory  an aspx page. If this is right  then how do we manage the aspx pages and develop them further in VS Or are we not meant to amend the appearance of lists etc.p  pThanks a lot, like I say I expect a bit of negativity here regarding the style of question but it really is necessary to help me move forward. Im not lazy by any means  if you can refer me to links that will help a complete newcomer to sharepoint grasp any of the concepts Ive mentioned above Ill happily do the reading  but Ive only managed to come accross material targetted at those who already have a firm grip on Sharepoint.p
Negative 631 pI have created a custom view by extending the View class.  On click I want the soft keyboard to pop up, just like it would with an edittext ie with predictive text turned on and with the ability to select all available input methods.  p  pI have tried having the view extend an codeonclicklistenercode that, when called, uses codeInputMethodManagercode to display the soft keyboard, which then in turn uses codeOnkeydowncode to intercept key presses.  This is clunky and doesnt work becausep  ol lipIm only able to switch between standard text and numerical input methods.  No other input methods work I need to be able to switch to the Japanese IME if a user has one, just like an edittext.  pli lipTheres no predictive text, which is absolutely necessary for the program as it will need users to enter japanese kanji.pli ol  pIs there any way to set up a connection between a standard view and the IME similar to an edittext p

Negative 631 pWe are consuming a Java Messaging Service based webservice via Axis, and the webservice returns an XML document wrapped in MIME headers. This causes an issue because we cannot recognize the return value. The solution found on Google states to move codemail.jarcode and and codeactivation.jarcode to the codeclasspathcode. However, we use a hosted solution, and the provider [Demandware] will not let us move the jar files. Is there another solution for this issue Is it possible to prevent JMS from wrapping the return in MIME headers Oddly, we have more control over the thirdparty webservice than our hosted solution.p

Negative 631 pConfusing title. Ill try to elaborate I have an AI chess game that uses minimax search to generate the computers next move. After going down the minimax tree to a chosen depth say 5, it finally finds the next best move to take. For my own testing purposes, I would like to be able to print out this next best move represented as a chess board configuration, but also the following 4 moves that it used to determine the score for that next move. That is, the path of the best choices at each of the lower levels in the minimax tree, starting with the top node that was eventually chosen to be the best next move. Any ideasp

Negative 631 pSuppose you have a Java class hierarchy of about 30 classes, with a base class BaseClass and two main subclasses SubclassA, SubclassB with several subclasses each.  A few of these subclasses have a certain behavior.  Lets say you can poke them, changing their state.  This is a new requirement adding behavior to an existing hierarchy.  Poke is meaningless to the majority of classes.p  precodeinterface Pokeable    void poke   int getTimesPoked    public class Pokey extends SubclassB  implements Pokeable    private int timesPoked  0   public void poke      timesPoked      public int getTimesPoked      return timesPoked     codepre  pShould this be done by implementing Pokeable in only those classes that need it, and then doing the following in all code that must poke any object thats pokeablep  precodepublic void processBaseClass b    if b instanceof Pokeable      Pokeableb.poke     codepre  pOr should the entire hierarchy implement Pokeable for the sake of the few that really ARE Pokeablep  precodeinterface Pokeable    void poke   int getTimesPoked   boolean isReallyPokeable   public class BaseClass implements Pokeable    public void poke    public int getTimesPoked  return 0    public boolean isReallyPokeable  return false   public class Pokey    private int timesPoked  0   Override   public void poke      timesPoked      Override   public int getTimesPoked      return timesPoked      Override   public boolean isReallyPokeable      return true      public void processBaseClass b    b.poke  codepre  pEdit added  Its kind of a Double Dispatch problem.  Where poker code does something to an object, it must call poke if the object is pokeable but cant if not.  Whether you poke or not depends on whether something wants to poke and whether the object accepts being poked.  I could use the Visitor pattern but that seems to make it more complicated.p

Negative 631 pI starting to use ServiceMix and Camel and Ive run through many examples.p  pIt seems that the examples that are OSGi can be deployed in ServiceMix via hot deploy or via console, but I dont know how to deploy a project that is not an OSGI.

Negative 631 pShame on me for this, but yes. I am having problems with this even if strongI am using ARCstrong. p  pstrongMy main question is am I having a circular reference in my codestrongp  pstrongMy code descriptionstrongp  pI have a game scene with a series of child nodes background, playerEntity, inputlayer. The issue is that strongwhen I trigger game over and replace the scene the scene would not deallocatestrong I added a dealloc method in the game scene even if not needed as I am using ARC.p  pI believe that this is due to the fact that in the child nodes I refer to the game scene and in the game scene I refer to them, creating a circular reference.p  pE.g. In the game scene update method I call the followingp  precodevoid updateccTimedelta  bool isGamePaused  [GameController sharedGameController].isGamePaused  ifisGameOverInProgresstrue     Do whatever game over animation u like  else ifisGamePausedfalse      elapsedTimedelta      Update input layer     InputLayerButtons inputLayer  InputLayerButtons  [self getChildByTagInputLayerTag]     [inputLayer updatedelta]      Move background     ParallaxMultipleBackgroundOneBatchNode background  ParallaxMultipleBackgroundOneBatchNode [self getChildByTagBackgroundNodeTag]     [background updatedelta]      verify enemies bullet collision     [self verifyPlayerBulletCollision]     [levelSprites updatedelta]      Update bullets position     [bulletCache updateVisibleBulletsdelta] codepre  pI know that is a kind of crazy approach but I wanted to avoid scheduling updates in the child nodes in order to have full control in the ShooterScene class of what was happening in the game. I dont use a semisingleton patter for the ShooterScene class and instead, I have a semisingleton GameController class instance that I use to communicate the game state between nodes.p  pBut in some child nodes I had to refer to the parent ShooterScene because for example using the semisingleton GameController class to store the ship position turned out in a too slow response e.g. reading the position in the update method and updating the ship accordingly proved much slower than updating it directly as I do in here. Hence my approach is not 100 clean as I wanted it to be I wanted to avoid all references to parent classes to avoid the issue of circular references and also to keep control of all events in the ShooterScene class. p  pSo, as example, here is how I update the ship position from the input layer namely strongInputLayerButtonsstrongp  precodevoid updateccTimedelta       Moving the ship with the thumbstick.     ShooterScene  shooterScene  ShooterScene  [self parent]     ShipEntity ship  [shooterScene playerShip]     delta  delta  2.0f      CGPoint velocity  ccpMultjoystick.velocity, 200     if velocity.x  0 ampamp velocity.y  0              ship.position  CGPointMakeship.position.x  velocity.x  delta, ship.position.y  velocity.y  delta            codepre  pstrongI thought that it was ok to refer to the parent scene and that this would not cause a circular reference. But it seem to happen, so I am confused on this.strongp  pHere is the code of the game over method, the dealloc method of ShooterScene is never called cleanup instead is calledp  precode   [[CCDirector sharedDirector] replaceScene[CCTransitionFade transitionWithDuration4.0 scene[MainMenuScene scene] withColorccc3255, 255, 255]] codepre  pIs there something in replaceScene that I dont understand I couldnt find the code for strongreplaceObjectAtIndexstrong so here I post only the Cocos2d 2.0 code for replaceScenep  precodevoid replaceScene CCScene scene      NSAssert scene  nil, Argument must be nonnil      NSUInteger index  [scenesStack count]      sendCleanupToScene  YES     [scenesStack replaceObjectAtIndexindex1 withObjectscene]     nextScene  scene  nextScene is a weak ref  codepre  pstrongI tried to see if the dealloc method would be called in other scenes simpler that ShooterScene and with no potential circular references and it did worked. So I am pretty confident that it is due to circular references but how can I detect the piece of code that makes this happenstrong p

Negative 631 pHeres the setup, I had a collection class in codeMyAssemblycode that looked like sop  precode[Serializable] public class MyCollection  ListltMyItemgt MyItem is also serializable      public string MyProperty get set       some methods for use by the current assembly  codepre  pAnd I had an application that made a reference to a wcf service, which in turn had a reference to this codeMyAssemblycode.p  pstrongThe problemstrong In the past weve made many changes to the classes without any issues, however I recently added a couple of new methodsno new properties to codeMyCollectioncode and after recompiling and redeploying the wcf service, the app consuming the service would all of a suddent return a null codeMyCollectioncode when being called.p  pstrongThe solution and questionstrong Updating the service reference in the app brought everything back to normal, but my question is why I was under the understanding that new items could be added to your classes without having to update the reference unless something was changed or deleted. Can someone explain this or refer me somewherep

Negative 631 pMy application has the ability to run off an code.SDFcode file SQL Server Compact for data if the client supports it, or a SQL Server database if the client does not support code.SDFcode files. The only problem is in writing code that will funnel into a common track whether Im dealing with one or the other. Let me give some examples of where Im going with this. p  pI dont want to have to write conditional statements every time I need to do something to see if the database is linked to a server or if Im accessing it from the code.SDFcode, so I switched my syntax to SQL to Linq. I have two of the .dbml files that map out the tables and fields so that I can now use the sql to linq syntax. My only problem is that if the two .dbml files exist in the same project they clash because there are public declarations on them. As far as I can tell, I cant exactly make these classes private or somehow separate them so that even though they have identical names and fields, they wont throw errors stating the class has multiple signatures.p  precodePublic Sub SDFAccess         Dim dc As New MembersData Source  CMembers.sdf            Dim q               From Leader In dc.GetTableOf Roles              Select Leader          DataGridView2.DataSource  q  End Sub   Public Sub ServerAccess         Dim dc As New ServerDBDataContext          Dim q               From sLeader In dc.GetTableOf ServerRole              Select sLeader          DataGridView2.DataSource  q     End Sub codepre  pI need to be able to just have one sub that runs for both conditions. Regardless of if the data is coming from a code.SDFcode or a SQL Server database. I appreciate your time.p  pstrongUpdate1strong So Ive noticed in the code.DBMLcode Designer files overloads for New. Is it possible I could use just one code.DBMLcode file for either server or Compact access as long as both data sources are identicalp  pstrongUpdate2strong  I would also assume that if everything was the same the only thing that holds me back between the two code.DBMLcodeis the System.Data.Linq.Mapping.DatabaseAttributeNameTestServer attribute in the Server code.DBMLcode file.p  pstrongUpdate3strong Alright new approach, maybe... I can include both classes from the two seperate generated code.DBMLcode files and only use the properties I need then submit the context back to the datasource. Problem again is how do I force the program into ignoring a class  in the namespace and not writting a conditional everytime I want to perform some action. Im beginning to wonder if I should just use a dataset as an intermediary. I really had my hopes on picking up LinqSql for this one though. p

Negative 631 pI noticed recently in my ASP.NET web application that if I set my User Agent to an empty string using a FireFox plugin to spoof the user agent, then ASP.NET will not generate the javascript required to perform postbacks. More specifically, if you try calling the codedoPostBacka, bcode function from your javascript, you will get an error saying that function is undefined.p  pI understand that every browser has a user agent, so this wont come up that often, but the essence of the problem still exists there are cases in which an unrecognized or malformed user agent can render your web application unusable if you rely on postbacks. p  pThis is similar to this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions917688aspnetnotgeneratingjavascriptforsomeuseragentsASP.net not generating javascript for some User Agentsa, but if Im reading it right it looks like youd fix each unrecognized user agent case by case and mask it as another browser. My concern is less with an individual user agent, and more so with the overall fact that certain user agents wont be able to use my application and I wont know it because the error happens in javascript and not on the server.p  pDoes anyone know of a way that I can force ASP.NET to always generate the required javascriptp

Negative 631 pIn maven, you can declare depenencies versions in dependency management section.  Say I have such pom for managing default versions of some libraries for all of my projects so I dont have to repeat them all over again and so I can ensure some consistency across all of my projects.p  pThen I have multiple projectsproject A and project B which have this pom set as parent pom. If in project A I want to use spring.jar, and I have spring.jar defined in dependencymanagement of As parent pom, I dont have to define spring version in As pom again, I just define that it depends on spring. So far its ok, is pretty simple how to do it in gradle too httpstackoverflow.comquestions9547170 p  pWhat Im wondering about is this situationbr Imagine that spring 3.0 depends on hibernate 3.0. In As parent pom I have defined hibernate dependency in dependencymanagement section with version 3.1, but spring is not defined there. Spring is defined in As pom with version 3.0. Dependency resolution in maven for project A would result in fetching spring 3.0 and hibernate 3.1  because despite fact that spring 3.0 depends on hibernate 3.0, dependencymanagement of As parent pom overrides hibernate version, so 3.1 would be used instead.p  pIs there way of defining something similar in gradle Note that I didnt have to specify hibernate in As pom specificly and also it is not specified as dependency in As parent pom  it is only in dependencymanagement section of As parent pom.p

As i was unable to train fisher eigen face recognizer models I tried using LBP face recognizer model and it jst worked...Basically what my face recognition program does is it jst draws a rectangle around the recognized face and I dont want any rectangle around alien faces...but LPB recognizer forces to do so...because it predicts the nearest label the detected face matches....hence an alien face also get predicted as a trained one......also does anybody know how to improve LBP face recognition using any preprocessing techniquesp

Negative 631 pI have installed on the same machine one strongapache serverstrong and one strongtomcat 7strong server. The apache server is used and configured with virtual hosts enabled as is supposed to server multiple php websites. However, we have the need to serve some tomcat applications as well so we need to configure the ajp connector.p  pEverything goes well, I have succeeded in configuring multiple apache virtual hosts which serves tomcat apps but I have only one problemp  pstrongThe session variables are not be maintained when accessing the java application through the apache virtual hoststrong. This works perfectly well when connecting directly to the 8080 port of the tomcat server.p  pI can see in the tomcat manager for each application the number of sessions is incremented with every refresh of a page from the apache virtual hosts.p  pThe java application is deployed in tomcat in the webappstestapp folder.p  pThe tomcat server xml has a ajp connector described asp  precodeltConnector port8009 protocolAJP1.3 redirectPort8443  maxThreads300 minSpareThreads10 enableLookupsfalse tcpNoDelaytrue tomcatAuthenticationfalse URIEncodingUTF8 gt codepre  pThe apache webserver contains the virtual hostp  precodeltVirtualHost 80gt     ServerName testapp.com     ServerAlias .testapp.com     ProxyPreserveHost on     ProxyRequests     off     ProxyPass  ajplocalhost8009testapp     ProxyPassReverse  ajplocalhost8009testapp ltVirtualHostgt codepre  pSo Apache proxy with tomcat is working fine. The thing is that jsp sessions are not working through the proxy. How can I make it work Is it something wrong with my configp
Negative 631 pIve read a lot of things about a hrefhttpshttp2.github.io relnofollowHTTP 2a which is still in development, so I also heard about the server push feature, but I my head, this is not clean.p  pDoes this server push feature mean that the server will be able to send a response to the client without the latter making a request Just like a vanilla TCP connection Or Im missing the pointp

Negative 631 pI hear so much about how well an app scales but there is so much conflicting information. On the one hand every web host claims to make scaling a breeze by adding more servers when the load increases, which seems so simple. But then other services come out which claim to do the scaling of your app for you on an already autoscaled web host like heroscale on heroku. If there is a need for these services then the web hosts themselves cant have been 100 scalable. And you still hear in the news about apps that blow up overnight and end up crashing or nearly crashing and ruining all of their traffic because they didnt scale well enough. Clearly the developers of these big time apps have heard about popular scalable web hosts like heroku, so if using them was all they needed to do, then there wouldnt be a problem. But there still is one. p  pAre there any summaries, guides, ect. out there which explain why all of this happens, the current solutions, and how scalable you will really be with those solutions Where should I start lookingp

Negative 631 pI am attempting to learn more about creating apps for OS X and have run into an issue that google has not been able to provide an answer for.  The example app I am creating is an RSS reader.  I have Core Data Entities of Folder and Feed, with Feed inheriting from Folder.p  pOne attribute of Folder is unreadCount, with type Integer64.  Feed inherits this attribute from Folder.  The idea is that a display of the count of unread articles in a feed will be displayed and the total number of unread articles of all feeds contained in a folder will be displayed with that folder.p  pI have an NSTreeController that is managing the Entity Folder.  This tree controller populates an outline view with the titles of the foldersfeeds and the unreadCount for each feed and folder right now folder is just defaulting to 0.  The unreadCount is getting displayed via a value transformer that takes the integer count and returns its string version.  All of this has bee set up with bindings and is working fine.p  pThe issue I am having is in getting the unreadCount of a folder to be the sum of all the unread counts in its feeds.  I have Googled for several hours and come across what appears to be a solution for tables populated from array controllers with the codesum.valuecode, but this obviously does not work with tree controllers from what I can determine anyway.p  pSo, my question, how do I get the displayed unreadCount for a Folder to be the sum of the unreadCounts of the Feeds the Folder contains when the display is an outline view populated from a tree controllerp

Is there any way to accomplish this  p  pIm sorry if this has been asked before, but all my searches just came up with using thumbnails to jump to a particular slide.

Negative 631 pIs there a way in various POSIXlike OSes to determine which file was mapped to a memory region using codemmapcode Linux has codeprocselfmapscode which contains not only the file name but also the device and inode numbers.

Negative 631 pIm working on a site by hand coding for the first time mainly a print designer. Im trying to only use HTML and CSS, as I havent had the time to dive into any Javascript and I really want to understand what Im using. So, my main content is set up in a grid of images, all the same size, 3 columns wide. p  pId like to use media queries for responsive design with different browserdevice sizes. Best I understand this, you create different CSS files for the same HTML layout that load depending on the size of the devicebrowser.p  pAs it is now, each image in the grid is set inside a div as an a tag. I then used CSS to define the image with the background property.p  precodeltdiv idmaincontentgt     ltdiv idproject1gt         lta idimage1 hrefURL heregtltagt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idproject2gt         lta idimage2 hrefURL heregtltagt     ltdivgt     ...etc.  image1      background urlimage.png norepeat     width x     height y   ...etc. codepre  pAfter a bit of research, it sounds like this is not a good solution its better to use the  tag in the HTML itself.p  pMy question is, am I going about this the wrong way Im a little confused about where to put the images so that I can modify the layout with media queries.

I used a hrefhttpfontforge.orgFontForgea to check the properties of the fonts, and found that the first font .ttf in JinWenDaZhuanTi.7z uses UnicodeBmpp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2upCF.png altUnicodeBmpp  pwhile the other two use Big5hkscsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com51wWJ.png altBig5hkscs img srchttpi.stack.imgur.combkRtF.png altp  pwhich is not the encoding scheme of my system. This may be the reason that the font names are unrecognizable in my systemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgqwQ8.png altfont viewerp  pActually I also try to solve this by trying to get the font with the messy font name. I tried codepycairocode after installing those fontsp  precodeimport cairo   adapted from  httpheuristically.wordpress.com20110131pycairohelloworld   setup a place to draw surface  cairo.ImageSurfacecairo.FORMATARGB32, 100, 100 ctx  cairo.Context surface   paint background ctx.setsourcergb1, 1, 1 ctx.rectangle0, 0, 100, 100 ctx.fill   draw text ctx.selectfontface ctx.setfontsize80 ctx.moveto12,80 ctx.setsourcergb0, 0, 0 ctx.showtext   finish up ctx.stroke  commit to surface surface.writetopng.gif codepre  pThis works well again with .ttf in JinWenDaZhuanTi.7zp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRIwku.png altenter image description herep  pbut still not with others. For example neither codectx.selectfontfacecode which reports codecairowin32scaledfontucs4toindexGetGlyphIndicesWcode nor codectx.selectfontfacesfcode which draws with the default font works. The latter name is the messy code displayed in the font viewer as shown above, obtained by a line of Mathematica code codeToCharacterCode[, CP950]  FromCharacterCodecode where codeCP950code is the code page of Big5.p  pSo I think Ive tried my best to tackle this issue, but still cannot solve it. Ive also come up with other ways like renaming the font name with FontForge or changing the system encoding to Big5, but I would still prefer a solution that involves Python only and thus needs less additional actions from the user. Any hints will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.p  pstrongTo the moderators of stackoverflowstrong this problem may seem too localized at its first glance, but it could happen in other languages  other encodings  other fonts, and the solution can be generalized to other cases, so please dont close it with this reason. Thank you.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Weirdly Mathematica can recognize the font name in CP936 GBK, which can be thought of as my system encoding. Take .ttf in ZhongGuoLongJinShiZhuan.7z for an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL1f6z.png altMathematicap  pBut setting codectx.selectfontfacecode does not work either, which will create the character image with the default font.p

Negative 631 pI need to make an interactive graph using MFC  p  pIt will be sort of like an equalizer control, where the user should be able to click on a point on the equalizer drag it to change its y axis value  p  pI am also just starting to learn MFC  p  pUpto this point I have used codeCPaintDCcode in the codeOnPaintcode function to draw the graph in a dialog box. For now the graph is very simple, with rectangle boarder, filled with white colour, and 4 points on the graph. I use codeOnMouseMovecode function to know if the cursor is inside the graph area and codeOnLButtonDowncode function to know where the user has clicked. If the user has clicked at a position which implies I want to change the y axis value of the graph point at that location, I repaint the figure using codeInvalidatecode and calling codeOnPaintcode inside codeOnLButtonDowncode. However, every time the graph has to update, I can see a flicker. it is not a problem now, but I will need to extend this graph so that it has at least 64 changeable points, with the ability to change the y axis value for a point by dragging instead of just clicking where I want it to go. Will the flickering problem increase as I increase the number of points and the complexity of the appearance of the graph The graph will need to have axes, gridlines, labels, etc later on. Is the flickering something I should be concerned about Is there any way I can prevent itp  pUPDATE br This is how I updated my OnPaint function according to how I understood CodeDreamers suggestion  p  precodevoid CgraphondlgboxDlgOnPaint       CPaintDC dcbltthis      CDC dc      CBitmap bmpDC       CRect rcClient      GetClientRectrcClient      if IsIconic               CPaintDC dcthis  device context for painting          SendMessageWMICONERASEBKGND, reinterpretcastltWPARAMgtdc.GetSafeHdc, 0           Center icon in client rectangle         int cxIcon  GetSystemMetricsSMCXICON         int cyIcon  GetSystemMetricsSMCYICON         CRect rect         GetClientRectamprect         int x  rect.Width  cxIcon  1  2         int y  rect.Height  cyIcon  1  2           Draw the icon         dc.DrawIconx, y, mhIcon          else              CDialogExOnPaint            dc.CreateCompatibleDCampdc      bmpDC.CreateCompatibleBitmapampdc, theGraph.width,theGraph.height       dc.SelectObjectampbmpDC      CPen pen     COLORREF pencolour  RGB0, 0, 0     COLORREF brushcolour  RGB0, 0, 255     COLORREF graphColour  RGB0, 0, 150       Draw boarder     pen.CreatePenPSSOLID, 3, pencolour      CBrush brushHSCROSS, brushcolour     dc.SetBkModeTRANSPARENT     dc.SetMapModeMMTEXT     dc.SetViewportOrgtheGraph.x1, theGraph.y1      dc.SelectObjectamppen       Draw graph boundary     CPoint point10,0     point1.x  0     point1.y  0     CPoint point20,0     point2.x  point1.x  theGraph.width     point2.y  point1.y  theGraph.height     dc.RectangleCRectpoint1, point2     pen.DeleteObject       Draw Horizontal at 0     pen.CreatePenPSSOLID, 1, pencolour     dc.SelectObjectamppen     dc.MoveTo0, theGraph.height  ORGDISTFROMBOTTOM     dc.LineTotheGraph.width, theGraph.height  ORGDISTFROMBOTTOM     pen.DeleteObject      dc.SetViewportOrgtheGraph.x1, theGraph.y1  theGraph.height  ORGDISTFROMBOTTOM  dc.SetViewportOrg always works relative to the clinet origin       Draw graph line     pen.CreatePenPSSOLID, 2, graphColour     dc.SelectObjectamppen     forint i  0 iltNUMOFSECTIONSINGRAPH i         dc.MoveTographSamplePoints[i].x, graphSamplePoints[i].y         dc.LineTographSamplePoints[i1].x, graphSamplePoints[i1].y            draw circles at graph sample points     forint i  0 iltNUMOFPOINTSINGRAPH i         CIRCLEdc, graphSamplePoints[i].x, graphSamplePoints[i].y, GRPSMPRAD                    dcblt.BitBlt0,0,rcClient.Width, rcClient.Height, ampdc, 0, 0, SRCCOPY     dcblt.BitBlttheGraph.x1,theGraph.y1,theGraph.width, theGraph.height, ampdc, 0, 0, SRCCOPY   codepre  pI will need to change the origins of the viewport a number of times and my guess is that this could be one of the reasons for the error.

Negative 631 pI am working with a treepanel in ExtJS 4.2.1. I used to set modifications on dom elements precisely change the class name with the listener codeafteritemexpandcode when I expand nodes of my tree. In fact it was to have leaves with even index with a different color than leaves with odd color. It worked fine. Getting the ids of the items which interest me, I can access them, and then modify the className. I did the same way for another tree but the problem is that when I create this tree I expand it with an codeexpandAllcode, so the listener codeafteritemexpandcode is not called. I need this codeexpandAllcode, but I need the codeafteritemexpandcode listener too. The reason I use this listener is because I have an easy access to item.id with the prototype  codeafteritemexpand node, index, item, eOpts code. With this id I can get the element I am looking for with the codeExt.getidcode method. I can do it with the codeafterlayoutcode listener but I would rather not because the access to the id is not so easy. I cant do it with the codeloadcode listener because the dom elements are not present yet.p  pSo I want to know, how could I totally expand my tree and use the code I made for my codeafteritemexpandcodep  pHere is my listener so you can understand better want I want to do in fact just add codetreeevennodecode to the className of even leaves of my tree.p  precodelisteners                  afteritemexpand function node, index, item, eOpts                      var domLeaf  Ext.getitem.id.next                      for  var int  0 int lt node.childNodes.length int                          if node.childNodes[int].data.leaf ampamp int  2  0                                  if ids.indexOfdomLeaf.id  1                                      ids[indiceIds]  domLeaf.id                                     indiceIds                                                                                   domLeaf  domLeaf.next                                          for  var int  0 int lt ids.length int                          domLeaf  Ext.getids[int]                         if domLeaf  null                              for  var int2  0 int2 lt domLeaf.dom.children.length int2                                  if domLeaf.dom.children[int2].className.searchtreeevennode  1                                     domLeaf.dom.children[int2].className   treeevennode                                                                                                                              codepre

Negative 631 pI have a few questions regarding headers and output buffering.p  pI know headers must be send before output or they will not work, and that output buffering stores all HTML into a buffer and sends it as one as opposed to PHP processes sent bits at a time.p  pSo does this mean when output buffering is on, all content is collected into one variable and where ever the headers were defined in the script they will be placed at the topfirstp  pAnd if output buffering is off you have to declare headers before any outputp  pAnd also to use any output buffering functions such as codeobcleancode you need output buffering to be on as if output buffering was off, you couldnt clean, take back, anything as it would of already been sentp  pFinally is output buffering turned onoff within php.ini as my XAMPP local host server seems to have output buffering on and my VPS doesnt, meaning I need to go to my VPS php.inip

Negative 631 pIm about to mark maybe 100,000 records retroactivelyposthocwise with categoryindicating string or integer values. There are more to come. The categories to be marked by this column reflect a scalar continuum of different category types, going anywhere from looser to tighter essentially. I was thinking about using string values though, instead of integers, in case one day I come back to it and not know what means what.p  pSo thats the reasoning for using strings, readability.p  pBut Ill be relying on these columns pretty significantly, selecting swaths of records based off this criteria.p  pObviously whatever it is Im going to put an index on it, but with an index, Im not sure how much faster querying on integers is than using strings. Ive noticed the speediness of using booleans, and can reasonably assume small integers can be queried on more quickly than strings based off this.p  pIve been pondering this trade off for some time now so thought Id fire off a question.

Negative 631 pive been assigned a quite simple project as an exam and i had the idea to develop it using the Domain Driven Design.p  pMany of you might say that the application is so simple that going with repositories and UoW is just a waste of time, and you probably be correct but i think of it as an opportunity to learn something more.p  pThe application is a Flight tickets system and from the following image you could probably well guess its functionality.p  pThe thing is that i am not sure if i am correctly seperating the aggregates and their roots.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKbar5.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT I presented the data model so anyone can spot the whole functionality easily.p  pThe thing is that from an employe perspective the flight as Rad said encapsulates the whole functionality and is the aggregate root.p  pHowever from an admin perspective, flights are none his bussiness. He just want to update or add new planescompanies, etc..p  pSo then there is a new aggregate root which is the Airplane which encapsulates the Airplane seatsEntity, the seatTypevalue object and the companyEntity as a new aggregate.p  ol liThis tends to confuses me as i have an aggregate rootAirplane inside another aggregateFlight Aggregate.li liSince the aggregate root is consider to be the CORE entity which without it the other entities inside it will not make any sense without it, i am thinking about Company. And i conclude that company makes sense without the airplane.li ol  pTo explain more i think of the scenario where the admin want to just insert a new Company, or want to first load a company and then its airplanes.p  pDDD principles say that any entities inside the aggregate may only be loaded from the root itself.  So here is the confusion.p

Negative 631 pWere building a chrome extension for our corporate environment.  When the user is browsing the web, if they click on a link, the extension should view the link and prompt the user a warning if the link is for a site that we have a business relationship with and warn them so and in a few rare circumstances prevent them from going to the link.p  pWe created an extension thats appears as a button on the toolbar and when the user clicks on it a popup appears.  So thats good.  Now we want to get rid of the button and have it invoked when the user clicks on a link on whatever webpage theyre viewing.  The extension would then read the link and decide if should prompt the user.  How is this done though  How can we make the extension override all href clicksp  pNote, were not currently concerned about when they type in the web address manually or click on a link from outlook, for reasons that are beyond the scope of the questionp  pThanksp

Negative 631 pMy intention here is to create a page which initially displays a basic form consisting of a text field where a password is entered, and a submit button. Upon submitting, the form will send the value back to the same page, where it is checked. This happens in the PHP file, not in a database. If the password is correct, the relevant HTML will be shown. This is what I havep  precodeltphp     inisetdisplayerrors,1     inisetdisplaystartuperrors,1     errorreporting1     ifissetPOST[logout]         sessiondestroy     elseifissetPOST[auth]         ifPOST[auth]password             sessionstart             SESSION[admin]true                   ifissetSESSION[admin] gt     ltform actionadmin.php methodpostgt         ltinput typetext nameauthgtltinput typesubmitgt     ltformgt ltphp     elseifSESSION[admin]true gt ltsectiongt ltHTML goes heregt ltsectiongt ltsectiongt     ltform actionadmin.php methodpostgt         ltinput typehidden namelogout valuelogoutgt         ltinput typesubmitgt     ltformgt ltsectiongt ltphp elseecho Incorrect passwordgt codepre  pNow this partially works. Entering the correct password will show the HTML that the person should see. What doesnt happen is when an incorrect password is entered, the echo on the final line will not be shown. It just goes back to the form, as if opening the page for the first time.p  pAlso, after successfully entering the password, I get a couple of warnings thrown upp  precodeWarning sessionstart Cannot send session cookie  headers already sent by output started at Dxampphtdocstop.php28 in Dxampphtdocsadmin.php on line 13 Warning sessionstart Cannot send session cache limiter  headers already sent output started at Dxampphtdocstop.php28 in Dxampphtdocsadmin.php on line 13 codepre  p...where line 13 is simply codesessionstartcodep  pWhile I have read that there are security issues with storing a password in the PHP file, it didnt seem like a major concern since no more than two people will be using this page containing tools for the manipulation of things that arent a major issue if messed with, or deleted. However, if this is a much bigger security issue than I think it is, please let me know.p

Negative 631 pCurrently, we have Java webservices in both REST and SOAP that streams images to the Swing client. The Swing client is like a Video player with controls Play, Move forward, etc. It calls the Webservice and displays images. When you play, it has to get images jpeg continuously and display them so simulate a video. There are other custom controls as well, like move forward, which pulls an image at some given point.p  pTomcat Serverbr Spring MVC RESTbr Swing Clientbr Java 1.7br 2 servers on AWSp  pOn the server, the webservice calls AWS API to pull the images. The images are sent as a raw bytes.p  pCurrently, the performance is a problem. When the Swing viewer loads, we pull x number of images and start playing, while its playing, we pull same x number of images and cache them locally. p  pI dont think more servers would solve the problem here.

Negative 631 pWhat Im trying to do here is really simple but its not working for me. Ive looked up many examples of very similar or matching questions on stackoverflow and others and their solutions havent worked for me.p  pBasically in a very simplified form, I have a button with some text in it. Id like it so when this button is clicked, a message box shows up displaying the text. However, I have 9 of these buttons think numbers on a calculator, and Id like to create a single method that handles all of these clicks, and outputs the correct text depending on the button.. which is why I need to pass the button as a parameter.p  pHeres the code I have for the method that handles it so farp  precodeprivate void btnClickobject sender, EventArgs e, Button b      MessageBox.Showb.Text  codepre  pThe above small code snippet is the same solution that others have used and had working. However, for me this code doesnt compile and shows an error that says strongNo overload for btnClick matches delegate System.EventHandlerstrong.p  pWhen I double click on that error, it takes me to the Designer.cs page for the form, and this is the line of code that has the errorp  precodethis.btnN7.Click  new System.EventHandlerthis.btnN7Click codepre  pI have no clue what the overload and delegate parts mean, sorry Im pretty new to this. I was thinking that maybe overload has to do with constructors but even if thats correct, Im unsure of what the next step would be.p  pI have strongSystem.Windows.Formsstrong included properly so the issue shouldnt be that the Button object wasnt recognized.p  pIf you could provide any insight as to what Im missing or doing wrong, thatd be very sweet Please let me know if you need any additional information to continue.p  pAnd lastly, this is unrelated to my issue but its a small question thats been irking me ever since I started using VS a week ago Are the control parameters strongobject senderstrong and strongEventArgs estrong that are automatically created for controller events even necessary Most of the examples Ive looked up online omit them. Ive just kept them in since they were created by default but I dont really know what kind of function they provide, and Ive never had to use those parameters in my methods.p  pThanks all p

Negative 631 pIm implementing an authorization server for our Web API 2 RESTful API using Bearer tokens.  To give some context, I am building an MVC web application as well as a PhoneGap mobile application to be deployed to both iOS and Android that will consume the RESTful API.  Ive done a lot of research on the subject, and understand I want to go with the emauthorization codeem flow for my MVC app as the client secret will be kept safe, however, it is my understanding that I must use the emimplicit grantem flow for the PhoneGap application, with it being a purely client side application it is assumed it cannot hold a secret.p  pWith that said, Im still fighting over my understanding of the security implications of the implicit grant flow.  When executed in a browser, I understand it to be emsomewhatem secure by validating the redirect uri, shortlived tokens, etc.  However, because PhoneGap will execute within its own browser instance thus returning the token via hash fragment that I will need to parse, how does this lock down the API to only my PhoneGap clientp  pWhats to stop a malicious hacker from simply stealing the clientid embedded in the HTMLJS and build their own PhoneGap application or any other and simply go through the implicit authorizationauthentication process, thus spoofing the approved or official PhoneGap app  This problem does not seem specific to my API  does this mean this problem exists for all APIs out there that implement the implicit flow including the big players e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.  How can I prevent this from happening, does it mean I have to denynot implement the implicit flow  If so, how do I consume the API emsecurelyem from my PhoneGap applicationp  pThanksp

Negative 631 pI use codeOS.File.readcode to read a files contents. On focus of Window I do codeOS.File.statcode and check its last modified date. I then record this date. On next focus of window I codeOS.File.statcode the file again, and if the modified date is new, then I will do a codeOS.File.readcode on it.p  pI was wondering is there a more efficient way Like for example I start the codeOS.File.readcode, and it by default gets the file header which should include date last modified, I check that as its reading and if its not a new date than I just cancel the read. This would be more efficient from a coding perspective, but from a performance perspective maybe not so muchp

Negative 631 pstrongEDITstrong To make the question clearer, Ill quote what Chris said in the comment, the question is How can I do on OS X what UIKit Dynamics does on iOSp  pI want to add gravity effect to my UI elements in my OS X app, and I wonder if there are some best practicesp  pIf I were developing an iOS app, I would turn to dynamic features introduced to codeUIKitcode in iOS7, but I couldnt find anything like that in codeAppKitcode. Ive even tried to use codeSprite Kitcode in a AppKit based app for its a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationGraphicsAnimationConceptualSpriteKitPGPhysicsPhysics.html relnofollowphysics simulationa, but I couldnt find a way to remove the annoying grey background in codeSKViewcode even when Ive set codebackgroundcode to codeSKColor.clearColorcode.p  pSo, I wonder if adding gravity is really that hard Is there any best practices Ive found some apps, like codePixelmatorcode, integrated some cool gravity features, so I guess thats possible Can anyone help me out of here Big thanksp  pA small discussion with the release of OS X 10.10, Apple is abandoning skeuomorphism, so is it still a good idea in design to add physics simulation in your app Like the rope effect in Pixelmator appp

Negative 631 pWe are in the process of migrating media items images, PDFs, etc from an old system into Sitecore. Some of the directories in the old system have multiple media items with the same name but different extensions. So if I had to get them via URL they would be as follows p  ul lihttpexample.comimagestest.gifli lihttpexample.comimagestest.jpgli ul  pThey can obviously be reached in the old file based system because their file extensions differ. In Sitecore, out of the box, this is not the case. Multiple items that live under the same node with the same name cannot be reached by adding extensions in front of them. Only the first media item would be hit regardless of the extensions.p  pIs there a way to get around this Can Sitecore differentiate between different media items with the same name but different extensions under the same node so that the above 2 URLs would work and point to the respective imagesp  pThanksp

Negative 631 pMy application dispatches HTML email notifications that have a couple of images.  We capture the reply message with a custom ribbon button.  When the user replies they are prompted to download content from the internet by a dialog.  If they select No, when I get the item in VSTO it has three or four .jpg attachments.  If they select Yes I get no attachments, as expected.p  pThe attachments are named WRDxxx.jpg xxx most often being 000 but occasionally other numbers, and then image001.jpg, image002.jpg and so on.  The files exist and consume storage, under 1k except for WRD... which is about 3.5k, but dont seem to contain any graphics.  I assume these are the pixels embedded by our email provider, and the largest is probably our logo although the accompanying file is empty.p  pWere using a mix of VSTO and Outlook Redemption to access the emails.p  pThis problem affects 20072013, but the switch to offbydefault for inline makes the issue more pressing.p  pMIME messagep  precodeContentType multipartmixed boundary4154024679712410635

Negative 631 pI have a problem with 3DES of PHP. Im doing a project that will access the internal interface of bank. They had developed an interface by java. One function of the interface is that bank system will get the public RSA key from my server. The bank side is the client. He accesses my server by HTTP protocol. They required that the RSA public key was encrypted by 3DES. The key for 3DES is 1000000200YYMMDD.And they required the result to be sent back by byte stream.p  pI download several program of 3DES from web. They can get the encryped string.

Negative 631 pTo all the scala developers out there, could you share the workflow for your daily development work, especially if you work on Play2p  pI was very eager to jump on Scala and Play for my future projects because of all the cool features Scala has to offer. However, I found that development in Play has been a pain in the neck to the point that I found it no longer productive. Initially I used Eclipse Luna, and very often I got false positive error highlights. I tried to clean and recompile. Sometimes the errors went away, and came back later. I didnt even get auto import I had to look up the packages manually instead of having a list packages to choose from.brbr I still believe that Scala is the next best thing for me to try, so I got myself IDEA14 Ultimate, with Scala plugin. I thought that things would be much better, but again, I also got false positive error highlight with different error messages from those in Eclipse. Even simple functions like Action, or Ok reported errors. When I started using library like Slick, I got red all over my files.brbr Is there any workaround at the moment to make either Eclipse or IDEA14 play nice with Play I appreciate any input.brbr scala version 2.11.4 java version 1.8p

Negative 631 pI am attempting to create a local search heuristic for a given greedy algorithm that attempts to 3color a graph. This greedy algorithm can get stuck ie, can color no more vertices, at which point my heuristic is used to slightly modify the current graph coloring to attempt to make more progress with the greedy algorithm. I know that I need to define a neighborhood of a given incomplete coloring, and then search through this neighborhood for better coloring candidates. My idea is to define the neighborhood as all colorings reachable by swapping two vertex colors in the graph. However, Im a little bit confused about how to go about this. What if the coloring is such that no swaps can be made to maintain the colorings validity How do I select the vertices to swapp

But I want the secondtothelast argument, codetmpfoocodep  pbrbr Note that it is possible to use word designators with a range like code13code, but this is impractical for a command with a large number of words where its not quickly obvious how many words there are, e.g.,p  precode set x date pwd git status git diff  git log  tail 30 date argsverbose time make test date gtamp tmplogmake.test.20150122Thu0834 amp  echo 130 tmplogmake.test.20150122Thu0834 codepre  pThe example above works, but you have to count and know that the word you want is the 30th word, which is timeconsuming and errorprone.p  pIs there an easy way to get the secondtolast penultimate wordp
Negative 631 pIve started learning heterogeneous parallel programming using CUDA desktop will be used, in the case it matters, and have a question for which I couldnt find the answer yet. Can the gpu card be used for gpgpu while playing 3D game If yes, how big a performance costs would be And how to measure them Running my app with and without game in the background doesnt seem like a trustworthy solution.p  pAFAIK, gpu card is busy in rendering scenes and other stuff, but I dont know how exactly it works. Is the device locked by the game application from being used for gpgpu until user exits the game Or it just receive asynchronous calls to do tasks like sop  ul lidevice is freeli ligame app asks the device to render sceneli lidevice is locked by game, do the job, after that it is free againli limy application asks the device to do some gpgpuli lidevice is locked by my app, do the job, after that it is free again,li liand so on...li ul  pAs the other solution is it possible to use separate gpu card for this purpose only maybe I need to prevent it from being used by game appp

Negative 631 pIm trying to make an expense report form for work for my coworkers to use and Ive run into a problem.p  pThe form finds the next empty row in the spreadsheet and then writes the data into that row. The problem is that the first three columns of my sheet are formula based and drag down throughout the entire spreadsheet. Because I am using the currentregion property, this means that the form writes the new details after all the formulas, even though they are blank and depend on the input. Here is my code for the data entry there is more, but this is the relevant part.p  precodeRowcount  WorksheetsData Entry.RangeD1.CurrentRegion.Rows.Count  With WorksheetsData Entry.RangeD1     .OffsetRowcount, 0.Value  Me.txtDOY.Value     .OffsetRowcount, 1.Value  Me.cboClient.Value     .OffsetRowcount, 2.Value  Me.cboProject.Value     .OffsetRowcount, 3.Value  Me.cboType.Value     .OffsetRowcount, 4.Value  Me.txtDescription.Value     .OffsetRowcount, 5.Value  Me.txtAmount.Value     .OffsetRowcount, 6.Value  Me.txtMiles.Value     .OffsetRowcount, 7.Value  Me.txtRate.Value End With codepre  pIve been able to counteract this by entering a blank column between column C and D cutting off the current region from the formula based columns but this is a roundabout way of doing it and looks untidy. Is there a clean way to do this that lets me leave the entire table as one contiguous block I assume its through the rowcount property but I cant figure out how to program it differently.p

Negative 631 pI have set up JBoss 7.1.1Final in domain mode with 1 master amp 1 slave instances. Apache HTTPD is at the front end providing fail over  load balancing. Session replication is set up amp working fine. p  pUsing Spring 3, I have injected one of the cache defined in domain.xml into a class provided by me. The purpose is to disallow concurrent login through the same user ID. For JBoss instances with sticky sessions, Spring provided SessionRegistryImpl works fine. But in cluster mode with non sticky sessions, a custom class ClusterAwareSessionRegistryImpl is implemented which is same as SessionRegistryImpl but instead of using local Maps it uses the injected cache with replication. Putting application specific class objects into the cache works and no exception is thrown. But when the cache is accessed for the objects on another jboss node then deserialzation results in ClassNotFoundException. From the exception it looks like that the application specific classes are not visible to  JBoss classloader. Searched amp tried a lot but I am unable to make this work. Setting cache with the classloader didnt work or maybe I missed something i.e. org.infinispan.Cache.getAdvancedCache.withthis.getClass.ClassLoaderp  pKindly point me in the right direction.p

Negative 631 pIm starting with Django and what puzzles me is the specification of the URLnamespaces.

Although I know SQL pretty well, aliasing tables and columns appear entirely different in Querydsl, but the examples Ive found dont really elaborate on the differences, so clarification would be extremely helpful.p

Negative 631 pI have two websites that are identical in structure. The index.php file needs to generate different content depending on the domain that the page is being served from.

Negative 631 pIm using angularfire 1.1.1 to store my apps objects and each object creates associated indexes. So when a user is created, that user is added to the users table and then the users index table gets keyed with the UID and points to the actual users id.p  pWhen the main state is called, I run a checkAuth method to see if a user is signed in. If so, then I want to assign rootScope.auth  iduserID, role role etc.p  pThe function works great in my login method but i dont know how to grab the value from my checkAuth method.

Negative 631 pWe have an inhouse developed MOJO that generates content and doesnt require you to have an existing project or POM. Think of the maven archetype plugin, where you can just run codemvn [mojo][goal]code and have maven just execute that goal without a POM.p  pThis MOJO connects to a specific database instance in a specific environment, and generates some metadata for the contents of the database, so our testers can inspect the metadata and locate productionlike data that has certain attributes they need for a given test.p  pWhen you execute the metadata mojo, maven resolves the MOJO from the available repos in our case an Artifactory repo, and it then does its work and returns. It does not create any artifacts or other outputs.p  pWe use TeamCity as our CI server, but it also has metadata generation jobs so with one click a dev can kick of a metadata generation job against a specific database.p  pThe problem with this is the Maven runner in TeamCity requires a POM. If TC hasnt already checked out a project from a VCS, or the project its checked out doesnt have a POM, the maven runner wont do anything. In this case, there is nothing to check out the MOJO is resolved from Artifactory so there is no POM.p  pI can set up the TC job to use the Command Line runner and have it execute, say, codemvn com.examplemetadatagenerate DenvironmentNameUAT1code, but then its impossible to specify the maven settings file that maven should use.p  pSo my question is, how do I do this Is it possible to have the maven runner execute an arbitrary maven command without needing a POM Alternatively, using the Command line runner, is it possible to have a TC job copy a specific maven settings file to the build agent so it can be referenced in the maven command as codemvn com.examplemetadatagenerate DenvironmentNameUAT1 s pathtosettingsfilecodep

Negative 631 pI need at times more than one asyncio coroutine, where the routines then would be nested  coroutine B running in coroutine A, C in B and so on.  The problem is with stopping a given loop.  For example, using loop.stop in the last top loop such as loop C kills actually all asyncio coroutines  and not just this loop C.  I suspect that stop actually kills coroutine A, and by doing so it annihilates all other dependent routines.  The nested routines are callsoonthreadsafe, and all routines begin as runforever.p  pI tried using specific loop names, or return, or break in the while loop inside the coroutine but nothing exits the loop  except stop which then kills nonspecifically all loops at once.p  pMy problem I described here is actually related to an earlier question of mine... a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30688835pythondaemonservercrashesduringhtmlpopupoverlaycallbackusingasynciowepython daemon server crashes during HTML popup overlay callback using asyncio websocket coroutinesa ...which I thought I had solved  till running into this loop.stop problem.p  pbelow now my example code for Python 3.4.3 where I try to stop the coroutineoverlaywebsocketserver loop as soon as it is done with the websocket job.

Negative 631 pIve recently decided to jump into the deep end of the Python pool and start converting some of my R code over to Python and Im stuck on something that is very important to me. In my line of work, I spend a lot of time parsing text data, which, as we all know, is very unstructured. As a result, Ive come to rely on the lookaround feature of regex and Rs lookaround functionality is quite robust. For example, if Im parsing a PDF that might introduce some spaces in between letters when I OCR the file, Id get to the value I want with something like thisp  precodeoAcctNum lt strextracttextBlock[indexVal], ltORIGsss[AZ09] codepre  pIn Python, this isnt possible because the use of codecode makes the lookbehind a variablewidth expression as opposed to a fixedwidth. This functionality is important enough to me that it deters me from wanting to use Python, but instead of giving up on the language Id like to know the Pythonista way of addressing this issue. Would I have to preprocess the string before extracting the text Something like thisp  precodeoAcctNum  re.subrltbwswb,  oAcctNum  re.searchrltORIG[AZ09], textBlock[indexVal].group1 codepre  pIs there a more efficient way to do this Because while this example was trivial, this issue comes up in very complex ways with the data I work with and Id hate to have to do this kind of preprocessing for every line of text I analyze.p  pLastly, I apologize if this is not the right place to ask this question I wasnt sure where else to post it. Thanks in advance.p

Any help would be highly appreciated.p  pMy test setup 1 Load Balancer 8 fat EC2 instances m4.4xlarge which is a bit overdimensioned, but Im still testing 1 DB r3.4xlarge with 140 GB memory, 1 TB storage and 10.000 provisioned IOPSp  pTest 30.000 virtual users in 10 minutes making 4 requests each 2 reading the DB, 1 writing it, 1 not using the DB. Fails after about two minutes because of too many errors caused by DB timeouts.p  pConcerning the hardware this setup should be able to handle the test requests, shouldnt it So I hope Im just missing the obvious and theres a parameter which has to be adapted to make everything working.p
Negative 631 pI have a fully built application that uses codeCore Datacode to store user entries. Everything is working well with that case. I have built iCloud synching into the app last year and that was working well, but recently I have discovered an issue after releasing an update with no iCloud changes. Upon updating, the users data had disappeared from the application though it still existed in iCloud. p  pThe reason for the disappearance was that when I created the application, I used codeCloudLogscode as the codeNSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKeycode, but on every subsequent launch including the upgrade, I used codeiCloudcode as the codeNSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKeycode, for the options when creating the store. This was of course a mistake on my part, but until recently, this actually worked in my application. Again, a mistake on my part to use different stores. p  pSo my task now is to migrate the codeCloudLogscode and codeiCloudcode directory locally, back it up and then migrate to a new codeiCloudPermanentcode store, or whatever itll be called. p  pWhen creating my application,  I used      codeNSURL localURL  [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory] URLByAppendingPathComponentMyApp.sqlite]code. When I went over to iCloud, I didnt change that to codeMyAppiCloud.sqlitecode I simply just migrated the data with codeCloudLogscode as the codeNSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKeycode and codeAPPCloudcode as the codeNSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentNameKeycode. p  pMy question is in order to do the migration, Im thinking that Ill back up the iCloud store, remove it, and then add it without the codeNSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKeycode. Do I need to create a new codeMyAppiCloud.sqlitecode and use that i.e so local without iCloud would use codeMyApp.sqlitecode, but the iCloud store would use codeMyAppiCloud.sqlitecode for the URL. p  pI dont see the point of doing that. Can anyone confirm whats the required purpose of using different codeURLscode one for local and one for iCloud Couldnt I just use the same, but with different codeNSDictionarycode optionsp

Negative 631 pI have kind of a unique issue. I am working on some pre existing code for a new project and am stuck. Basically what I have is when I enter this command version then a version pops up and this command status then the status pops up. These are done via command line. But the existing code make it so that upon entering the command version, you would be prompted for a login or alternatively you could enter credentials along with the version command. I want to remove this login prompt and make the version command work without a login. I have included the code for it, this code basically just returns and I need help on which package I should look at next. I have checked the package which it implements and also the import ones.

Negative 631 pOn nonOrchard applications the pattern is to isolate data models and data access code in a project which is referenced by things like a domain  business logic libraries, web application projects, web service projects, etc.p  pThe idea with Orchard emappears to beem restricting a data model to exactly one module with no intention of having any relation to other modules data model.p  pRestrict is perhaps a bit harsh or inexactmaybe limit is a better choice of wording here. Given two modules, A and B, and while working on module A we can add a reference to module B, and use repositories for entities from it. But when working on module B, and the need arises to access data from module A, we cannotat least not elegantly within the framework. The circular reference problem exists here.p  pIn this circumstance Im inclined to several approachesp  ol liconsolidate the two modules into a single one and have to deal with a potentially burdensome and risky data migrationli liresort to accessing the data directly without using the framework or a repositoryli liput all data models in a single module that is referenced by all other custom modules again, more data migration riskli liraise a hand here...li ol  pIs any of this a correct interpretation of the Orchard software designers intention for modules and data relationsp

Negative 631 pDoes the noninterference requirement for using streams of nonconcurrent data structure sources mean that we cant change the state of an emelementem of the data structure during the execution of a stream pipeline in addition to that we cant change the source data structure itself Question 1p  pIn the section about a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavautilstreampackagesummary.htmlNonInterference relnofollownoninterferencea, in the the stream package description, its said  For most data sources, preventing interference means ensuring that the data source is emnot modified at allem during the execution of the stream pipeline.p  pThis passage does not mention modifying the state of elementsp  pFor example, assuming shapes is nonthreadsafe collection such as codeArrayListcode, is the code below considered to have an interference Question 2p  precodeshapes.stream        .filters gt s.getColor  BLUE       .forEachs gt s.setColorRED codepre  pThis example is taken from a a hrefhttpcr.openjdk.java.netbriangoetzlambdalambdalibrariesfinal.html relnofollowreliable sourcea to say the least, so it should be correct.

From the section about noninterference 3.2.3p  pBut the rules for streams forbid any modification of stream sourcesincluding, for example, changing the value of an element by any thread, not only pipeline operations.p  pIf whats said in the book is correct, does it mean we cant use the stream API to modify state of elements using codeforEachcode, and have to do that using the regular iterator or foreach, or codeIterable.forEachcode Question 4p

Negative 631 pWhen calling a recursive function with kwargs multiple times, previous values of the kwargs are retained even though they are local variables. p  pThe following code snippet demonstrates the problem. p  precodeusrbinenv python  def countfunccount, messagelist[]     count  1     if count gt 0         messagelist.appendcount         countfunccount, messagelistmessagelist     else         print messagelist         del messagelist         returncount  if name  main     printCall 1     countfunc5     printCall 2     countfunc5     printCall 3     countfunc5     printCall 4     countfunc5 codepre  pThe output is p  pCall 1 [4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 2 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 3 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 4 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1]p  pI would expect the output for all for calls to bep  p[4, 3, 2, 1]p  pI call countfunc 4 times, each passing no kwargs. The function definition is set to provide an empty list as a default for messagelist if the kwarg is omitted. However, messagelist seems to retain its previous value across all 4 calls of countfunc.  p  pI would expect that local variables in prior calls of countfunc should not influence local variables in subsequent calls. p  pI suspect this has to do with the way Python handles recursion. Passing in an empty list each time I call the function gives the desired result, so I already have a work around.  I would like to understand why this is happening.  Does anyone have insightp

Negative 631 pIm trying to get my program to print out the amount of words in a test string, but its printing out a much larger number instead.
