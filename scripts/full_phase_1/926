Positive 926 pI am working on my first real Rails 4 app and I have run into a problem with my design. p  pCurrently I have a Service model which started out with attributes such as name, onlinestatus, ip, dnsname, port, and servicetype. This model has evolved to include many methods and attributes for specific servicetypes like authtokens, etc. and thus it is very overgrown. The columns added to the database to accommodate the needs of the different types of services make this model act like a ghetto version of STI without separate classesmodels.p  pThe Service model also has methods such as ping which is used to determine the onlinestatus. I believe the types of services are different enough to warrant their own separate tables because each service seems to have many unique properties and methods.p  pExamplep  pA generic service has name, ip, dnsname, onlinestatus, etc...p  pA specific service such as Plex will have name, ip, dnsname, onlinestatus, username, password, authtoken, etc... p  pThe issue, is that I would like to be able to access the more specific types of services from their parent Service class. So when I create a view, I can loop through all the generic services and the more specific services as if they were all the same type of service or at least be able to access all services in some simple way without looping through each type and appending them. p  pI also need to access the specific types of models on their own, so doing something like couchpotatos.each in my view will only go through the instances of the Couchpotato class.p  pControllers play into this confusion too since I dont exactly know how to have a single page display all these different types of models from the same controller.p

Positive 926 pI have three assemblies. A main executable, a common library and an extension. In the extension, I need to implement a certain interface coming from the common assembly in order to register the class as a service in a static codeKernelcode class. p  pThe only problem, I dont have access to some types needed to implement the interface. For instance, the interface codeAcode has a method codeDoWorkcode that has a return type codeBcode. The extension assembly doesnt have the codeBcode type in its references and it cannot be added. p  pIs there a way to implement the interface, make the method throw a codeNotImplementedExceptioncode and have the extension assembly compilep  pNote, the main assembly needs to reference the extension in order to register it, so I cant reference the main assembly in the extension and declare the type in the main one.p

For example, if a user creates codeMyThingcode and codeMyHandlecode, codegetHandlecode should return a pointer to a codeMyHandlecode, which the user can later use in codeuseHandlecode.p  pThis will work, but I dont like the design because multiple implementations of codeIHandlecode can get mixed up between implementations of codeIThingcode.  Also in codeuseHandlecode, users will need to explicitly downcast to their implementation of codeIHandlecode.  Is there a more typesafe way to do thisp

Positive 926 pHere is my scenario. I have a plugin system. The plugins can detect and lookup each other at run time via a master list of plugins. The hierarchy is suchp  precodeBase Class A Unknown Class B extends A Known method from Class A, well call it E Dynamically generated Class F extends B Overridden Method E Other methods inherited from A and B codepre  pF should inherit behavior from B, with the exception that E is overridden. F is then instantiated separately from B as a different object with similar but not identical behavior. The class B is not known at compile time, but it can be identified with an iteration and check for instance of A in the master list of plugins.p  pMy specific case involves a game. Not necessarily what Im doing, but a good example would be finding every sword added by other plugins, and then making a new copy of the sword, with all the same abilities, except it shoots fire instead of whatever fancy swing effect it may have had originally, and method E determines what happens when the sword is swung.p

Positive 926 pI know that I broke openclose principe, but previous architecture does not require such functionality. Thats a storyp  pI have one abstract activity that extends CordovaActivityfrom XWalk library, and have two concrete activities that extend it  both with its own scope of logic, a lot of that logic has calls to protected methods of activity class.  And now we have problems with crosswalk on some custom emulators, I havent even access to them.  The most problem is CordovaActvities from XWalk and from cordova have almost the same api, but without any general interface, so code for both abstract activities will be almost the same, but parent class should be different. So, is there some elegant way to do this without blind copypaste, but without core refactoring of my classesp  pI was thinking about some kind of dependency injection for my business logic resolver using empty fragments  they allow me to use most of activityrelated methods. Or move most generic UI features also to fragments.p  pBut I believe that there should be some easier way just to change parent classes and few methods signatures  p  precodeConcreteLogicActivity1 extends BaseActivity ConcreteLogicActivity2 extends BaseActivity  BaseActivity extends XWalkActivity codepre  pNow I need to make p  precodeXWalkBaseActivity extends XWalkActivity CordovaBaseActivity extends CordovaActivity codepre  pthen Ill have Logic1 derived from XWalk and Cordova, and Logic2 too.  But it will be primitive copypaste with a lot of the same code.p

Now what I want to achieve is to have same base class Holded in both of classes. So if Id change holdedID from Inventory, Equipments writeHoldedID function would output Holded ID is 100. Thanks and regardsp  pEdit More detailed I have a game. Each person is a character, that owns Equipment, Inventory and Cargo class. Each class contains about 20 slots for items. Now the thing is, that if you try to move an item, for ex. from inventory, to equipment, and theres such index of item, then the item is swapped  goes holded, and now I may throw such holded item into Equipment, Inventory or Cargo. Thats why Im in need to share such class between EqInvCargo.p

The initial motivation might be If the developer modifies the codeDerivedcode class the way he replaces codeBaseltSomeTypegtcode by codeBaseltOtherTypegtcode, he also needs to replace this in all occurences within the codeDerivedcode body. For the cases, the codeSomeTypecode is compatible to codeOtherTypecode and there is also a symbolic name available like the Base.T, there is no other work do to. Yes, I know, we have automatic refactoring tools... Just a question...p

And I made an instance for object codeACorecode that at everywhere in project, i can use codeAcore.AConfiguration.XYZcode XYZ is method or property of codeAConfigurationcode class or codeACore.AEquipmentmanager.ABCcodeABC is method or property of codeAEquipmentManagercode classp  pAt project B, I still have same structure with project A codeBCore, BConfiguration, BEquipmentManagercode. But codeBConfigurationcode has different with codeAConfigurationcode because each project has different configuration and codeBEquipmentManagercode also has different with codeAEquipmentManagercode. p  pI want to reuse code for class codeACorecode and codeBCorecode because they have the same code Initialize EquipmentManager, Initialize Configuration, Dispose EquipmentManager, Dispose Configuration,.... Now, I want to write a library codeBaseCorecode that have the same structure with codeACorecode and codeBCorecode there are 2 class codeConfigurationcode, codeEquipmentManagercode, same Intialize function, Dispose function, and with specific project like A project, B project, or even C, D project later i can use codeBaseCorecode library class for reuse code and just implement codeXEquipmentManagercode, codeXCofigurationcode depend on each project.p  pWhat is the best way I should design in this case Thank for sharing your idea.p  pRegards, Hoa Nguyenp

I looked at on old script of mine where I first dropped the relationship and recreated it afterwards.

Kind of complicated but I give it a go  the sql needed was part of a publication script that build tables from views, and then updated those tables.

Lets say I create a new project and start putting source files in a directory other than the default that shows up the first time. Afterwords, whenever I open the project, I have to navigate to the source directory once during that session. Like I said, not a big deal but if solvable, then its icing on the cake. Quite a few times I absentmindedly put the source file in the default directory and end up committing that file to the SVN and if I am lucky, going through all the files, removing them, then adding them again. p  pSo my question is, is there any way to specify the default source directory on a per project basisp
Negative 926 pI have an OSGi target platform consisting of Equinox, the Spring Framework, Spring DM, and several custom bundles for my application. All of my bundles contain Spring application contexts and so are automatically loaded by the Spring OSGi extender.p  pSome of my bundles contain Swing ui components. The problem is that the Spring OSGi Extender does not create these application contexts on the AWT EventQueue which results in several ui issues.p  pThe only workaround Ive found so far is to create a fragment bundle for the springosgiextender and configure the taskExecutor as mentioned a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgosgidocs1.2.1referencehtmlappdeploy.htmlappdeploy3aextenderconfiguration relnofollowherea. Basically my custom taskExecutor implementation forwards all execute calls to the AWT EventQueue. This is not really a good solution since ALL the Springpowered bundles in my application will be created on the AWT thread, slowing down the ui at startup and basically killing our splash screen load status since its starved of any refresh.p  pAny ideas about how to create those SpringSwing bundles on the AWT EventQueuep

Negative 926 pHey everyone. Ive searched the web and really havent found a problem quite like this. My set up is as follows I am trying to make an app where a user drags uiimageviewss on a uiview inside a uiscrollview which can zoom in, but also drag the image to a trashcan to be deleted. When the scrollview is zoomed in, the user can still drag because I have subclassed uiimageview and overridden the touchesMoved method. I want the user to be able to drag the uiimageviews to a trashcan in the bottom right corner of the screen. What I implemented already works when the uiscrollview is normal zoom scale, but when you zoom in you cannot drag the image to the trashcan, because well, the trashcan is a subview of the controllers view itself this was so that it wouldnt zoom with the uiview and of course is not in the right coordinates of the screen for the uiscrollview. p  pIve found a view method called ConvertRect that converts a rectangle to the coordinates of whatever view you give to the method, but this doesnt seem to be working. I do a check within each mapimagethe imageview subclass that checks the frame of the uiimageview intersects the frame of the trashcan. So I try this method before I do that check, but like I said it doesnt seem to be working.p  pSo with all that complicatedness, let me say in a nutshell my problem. I want to drag images over to a trashcan regardless of what zoom level at uiscrollview is at. I can make the trashcan part of the uiscrollview but I need a way to make it keep in the bottom right corner and also not zoom when the uiscrollview does. Any ideas would be so greatly appreciated, thanks guys. p

Negative 926 pI have a C Control Library Project compiled using CLR. Inside this project there is a User Control that makes a call to a native DLL.

The User Control can be viewed fine in the designer by itself with the DLL call included. Also if the control is added manually to a form and executed as a program, it will also display fine.p  pThis makes me suspect that the problem is just a matter of Visual Studio Designer needing to know where that native DLL is located.

So it makes sense to me that designer is just complaining because it cant fine it.p  pIs there a way to make this workp

Negative 926 pI would like to have your take on the following.p  pWere looking at SOA as a solution to some conceptual problems we have. We dont want to built the same logic several times. So want to make some WCF services and have different clints retrieve data through these services perhaps even Apple apps. The ideal situation being that the clints are as thin as possible, only being concerned about presentation. All the business logic and data access should be taken care off in the WCF services.p  pNow my boss looked into this and his biggest concern is basically that wed fall into chaos. He imagines well be defining a new method for each query we want to execute on the database, roughly said.p  pSo like p  ul liRetrieveCustomerByIdli liRetrieveCustomerByNameli liRetrieveCustomerByStoreIdli liRetrieveCustomerWithPersonalDetailsButWithoutAddressByIdli lietc...li ul  pSo his idea is to have clints construct queries and send it to the WCF services. The WCF services execute the queries, apply bussiness logic and returns the results.p  pI am very much interested in all the cons or pros you guys can come up with. Thank you in advance for thinking with me.p

Negative 926 phey guys, probably simple question for the most of you. I cant figure out the reason. Im doing ajax requests when typing into a searchbox. the result I always get is a unordered list. I only show those listitems that currently match the string in the searchbox. I apply a class.matched to them. I remove all items that dont have a class .matched applied.p  pAnd moreover Im using a jquery highlight plugin to highlight the current string in the searchbox inside the list. So the listitem has the exact words in the searchbox highlighted.p  precodefunction doSearchkeyCode       if .s.val             jqXHROld  .post Searchmap.ajaxurl, data, functionresponse               sr.htmlresponse              add class to all results that match the current searchterm             var found  searchresults ul liicontains  .s.val               found.addClassmatched              remove all remaining listitems             searchresults ul li.not.matched.remove              highlight current string in searchbox             searchresults ul li.matched.highlight.s.val           ... codepre  pEverything works fine, except for one case. Whenever the input field gets its content deleted and is empty again the browser cant stop a script. The bug is 100 caused by the plugin or moreover this line codesearchresults ul li.matched.highlight.s.valcode ... the plugin itself works just fine. Im using it all the time. The plugin does even work for this scenario, just in this one rare case when the ajax request is currently fired and the text in the input is set empty again the browser crashes.p  pAny idea why that could happen Its probably just a logical problem that I have. Im already checking if the input is empty. So actually the hightlight line shouldnt even be fired when the text in the input is removed again.p  pany ideap

Negative 926 pIm working on a program that sends a command to the server and creates a file on the server to let it know its connected for example,  while the program is running it creates a file say here everytime it loops,  a php site then checks the server for that file, if the file is there it knows the program is connected.  However when it suddently stops say because the computer is shutdown, it might happen to shutdown when the file has been created, so say it shutsdown now in 5minutes if the server checks the file will be there, is there any way to have the program delete the file on unexpected shutdown  This is on C.p  pthank,p
Negative 926 pIm having difficulty with formtastic. Ill first try to sketch the situation as good as I can.p  pI have a model named codeonlinescorecode which has attributes codepublishercode, codeidcode, and some other basic ones. One of its attributes however is an array with codeurlscode. Those codeurlscode are hashes with content like thisp  precodeurl gt httpwww.example.com, description gt blabla codepre  pSo the array looks like thisp  precode[url gt httpwww.example0.com, description gt blabla0, url gt httpwww.example1.com, description gt blabla1, url gt httpwww.example2.com, description gt blabla2] codepre  pIm now making a form to create a new codeonlinescorecode and for that I need a way to collect input for that array. Id like to have 2 fields url and description who get mapped into the urls array somehow. Once that works, I would want the user to be able to add several urls at once, for example with an add new url button which generates another 2 of those fields.p  pI already tried to accomplish this on some ways for example like thisp  precoderest of form lt onlinescore.url.each do link gt   lt form.inputs for gt link do urls gt     lt urls.input url, as gt url gt     lt urls.input description, as gt string gt   lt end gt lt end gt rest of form codepre  pwhich gives the errorp  blockquote   pundefined method modelname for HashClassp blockquote  pI also tried to define a new input type scoreurl but I didnt get far with that either because I need a tuple of 2 fields, not one and I didnt find a way to do that yet. I looked into forms without a model, but I dont really think that is what I need either...p  pDoes anyone have an idea how to do this p

Negative 926 pI just started working on an existing grails project where there is a lot of code written and not much is covered by tests. The project is using Hudson with the Cobertura plugin which is nice. As Im going through things, Im noticing that even though there are not specific test classes written for code, it is being covered. Is there any easy way to see what tests are covering the code It would save me a bit of time if I was able to know that information.  Thanksp

The text would be multiple lines but each line is only one or two words length. The text is from a different person at  time. I could ask that person to provide a training file e.g. with the alphabet and 09 numbers but I cannot really ask for a much more complicated training than this. p  pI need to integrate the recognition as part of another Java application but the solution doesnt need to be Java.

Negative 926 pI found that using Environment object isnt reliablee to determinate SD card. Actually it works, however sometimes tells like as no SD card, so I use just direct mount as sdcard and it works. Now I realized that a device may have several SD cards. My device report it as externalsdcard, so I can access this card as externalsdcard or sdcardexternalsdcard. Now question, how to figure out type of a particular mount I can traverse directory, but File object doesnt have any attribute telling me I am SD card. I remember regular Java provides FileSystem objects which I can use to inspect particular files and this object can tell me if a File object is simple file, or it is drive, or it is external drive. Is something like that available for Androidp

Negative 926 pIve got an ipad webapp Im working on where you can draw on a canvas and save it. Like a more basic paint program. I need to be able to upload and image to the background and draw on it. Right now that wouldnt be too difficult since I got the drawing functionality and it wouldnt be hard to just print the image to the background and draw on it. The problem Im having is that it also needs to have manageable layers. This means it needs to support alpha pixels. p  pSo what Ive done is written a panel class that when paint is called it moves down through its child panels and paints their buffered images to the temp image. Then I take that and paint it over the parent continueing until the image is flattened to a temporary image.p  pThis works fine especially on a desktop. But to accomplish this I had to write the putImageData code from scratch which loops through the array of pixels and paints them taking the alpha in account. Like sop  precode    var offset  canvasW4yx4     forvar r  0 r lt newHeight r              var lineOffset  size.width4  columnsr  offset         forvar c  0 c lt columns c4                      var start  rcolumnsc             var destStart  startlineOffset             var red  imageData[start]             var green  imageData[start1]             var blue  imageData[start2]             var alpha  imageData[start3]              var destRed  canvasData[destStart]             var destGreen  canvasData[destStart1]             var destBlue  canvasData[destStart2]             var destAlpha  canvasData[destStart3]              var opacity  alpha255             var destOpacity  destAlpha255             var invOpacity  1opacity              var newRed  Math.absred  reddestRedinvOpacity             var newGreen  Math.absgreen  greendestGreeninvOpacity             var newBlue  Math.absblue  bluedestBlueinvOpacity              canvasData[startlineOffset]  newRed             canvasData[startlineOffset1]  newGreen             canvasData[startlineOffset2]  newBlue             canvasData[startlineOffset3]  255               codepre  pThis takes about 50 miliseconds per layer. Not very good for a desktop. Takes a whopping 1200 miliseconds for the ipad So I tested it with the original putImageData which doesnt support alpha and it was still not very impressive but its the best I got Im thinking.p  pSo here is my problem. I know there is an overal opacity for drawing with canvases but it needs to be able to draw some pixels completely opaque and some completely transparent. Is there an putImageData that includes opacityp  pIf not any recommendations on how I can accomplish thisp

Negative 926 pImagine a set of libraries that represent some APIs. By using an inversion of control mechanisms, concrete implementations will be injected in a consuming project.p  pHere is a situation. I have some of the API libraries depending on other API libraries for certain functionalities  therefore the API libraries themselves are coupled at some point. This coupling can become an issue later, because changing one API will result in changes of the dependent APIs, and the corresponding implementations will also need to be changed, so in the worst case we end up with quite a number of projects that need to be modified to reflect a change form only one of them.p  pNow I have in mind two possible solutions for thisp  ul lipCreate a monolith API project that unites the related API libraries.pli lipFurther decouple APIs by making each library provide interfaces for all strongfunctionalitiesstrong that are dependent on the other API, so the direct dependency is removed. This might result in a similar code in both libraries, but gives freedom to the implementations chosen via the IoC mechanisms and also allows the APIs to improve independently from each other when an API is changed, the changes would affect only its implementation libraries, not other APIs or their implementatons.pli ul  pThe problem with the second approach is the duplicating of code, and the result might be of having too much api libraries that need to be referenced for instance, in .NET application each API will be a separate DLL. In some scenarios, like Silverlight applications, this can be an issue with app size  download time and client performance overally.p  pIs there a better solution for the situation. When is it better to merge some API libs into one bigger and when not I know this is a very general question I am asking, but lets ignore the due dates, estimations, client requirements and technologies for a moment, I want to be able to determine the right approach based on both achieving maximum scalability and minimum maintanance time. So, what could be a good reason to choose either approach, or another one you might suggest mep  pstrongEditstrongp  pI feel like I must clarify something about the question. I have in mind decoupling APIs from each other, not the API from its implementation. So, for instance if I have security API for validating permissions of access, and user accounts API that uses references the security API, changing security API will bring the need of changing the user accounts API, and the implementations of both of them. The more APIs that happen to be coupled this way, the more changes will have to be applied. It is what I want to avoid.p

Negative 926 pConsider, for examples sake, the logic A user may only edit or delete a comment that the user has authored.p  pMy Controller Actions will repeat the logic of checking whether the currently logged in user can affect the comment. Examplep  precode[Authorize] public ActionResult DeleteCommentint commentid      var comment  CommentsRepository.getCommentByIdcommentid     ifcomment  null           Cannot find comment, return bad input         return new HttpStatusCodeResult400      ifcomment.author  User.Identity.Name          User not allowed to delete this comment, return Forbidden         return new HttpStatusCodeResult403      Error checking passed, continue with delete action     return new HttpStatusCodeResult200  codepre  pOf course, I can bundle that logic up in a method so that Im not copy  pasting that snippet however, taking that code out of the controller and putting it in a ValidationAttribute keeps my Action smaller and easier to write tests for.

Negative 926 pIm working on a rewrite of an app that has three categories of users and Im wondering about the best way to link them to the authentication systemp  pInHouse Staff, Contractors, Customers who interact via the app.p  pThe inhouse staff model doesnt store any address info. Contractor and Customer have some common attributes  address, phone number, email, etc. but they have completely different relationships to the rest of the system.p  pIn the current version I have discrete models for each type and I manually maintain a link to the equivalent of the user profile table. But I dont have model inheritance available in the current system.p  pMy question is, do you have any general advice for this and how would you link it to the existing Auth system, or is there a 3rd party auth system that youd recommend I look at.p  pThanks.p

Negative 926 pI have a table of 100 images 10x10 and the same table of DIVs above it. They are positioned correctly on top of each other, even in IE8 dear Lord. Now, the script is very messy, so Ill describe the main idea p  pAll the tables have codeabsolutecode positioning. The codezindexcode of the DIVs is Google and of the images is 0. The idea of that table is, basically, drawing lines. By this I mean I start to drag a line from a certain DIV to the destination DIV, a script runs and calculates the line, sends the info to the image generator, which returns the images to be put in the tables of images. This brilliant idea works perfectly in all browsers, except for IE8, which GRABS, like a cancer, the image underneath the clicked DIV and drags it all over the place, trolling me badly. p  pstrongHow can one overtake thatstrongp  pP.S.

Negative 926 pI hope someone can help me solve a very serious problem we face at the moment with a business critical application losing data when a user works in it. p  pThis happens randomly  I have never reproduced this but the users are in the system a lot more than me. p  pA document is created with a load of fields on it, and there are 2 rich text fields. Were using Domino 8.5.3  there are no extension lib controls in use. The document has workflow built in, and all validation is done by a SSJS function called from the data query save event.  There is an insane amount of logging to the sessionscope.log and also this is now captured for each user in a notes document so I can review what they are doing. p  pSometimes, a user gets to a workflow step where they have to fill in a Rich Text field and make a choice in a dropdown field, then they submit the document with a workflow button. When  the workflow button is pressed does a Full Update some client side JS runs first p  precode Process any autogenerated submit listeners if XSP.processListeners   Not sure if this is valid in all versions of XPages     XSP.processListeners XSP.querySubmitListeners, document.forms[0].id   codepre  pI added this to try and prevent the RTF fields losing their values after reading a blog but so far its not workingp  pthen the Serverside event runs and calls view.save to trigger QS code for validation and PS code to run the workflow agent on the server. p  p95 of the time, this works fine.p  p5 of the time however, the page refreshes all the changes made, both to the RFT field CKEditor and the dropdown field are reloaded as they were previously, with no content. Its like the save hasnt happened, and the Full Update button has decided to work like a page refresh instead of a submit. p  pUnder normal circumstances, the log shows that when a workflow button is pressed, the QuerySave code starts and returns True. Then the ID of the workflow button pressed is logged so I can see which ones are being used when I am reviewing problems, then the PostSave code starts and finally returns true. p  pWhen there is a problem, The QuerySave event runs, returns true if the validation has passed, or false if its failed, and then it stops. The ID of the workflow button is also logged. But the code should continue by calling the PostSave function if the QuerySave returns true  it doesnt even log that its starting the PostSave function.p  pAnd to make matters worse, after the failure to call the PostSave code, the next thing that is logged is the beforePageLoad event running and this apparently reloads the page, which hasnt got the recent edits on it, and so the users loses all the information they have typed p  pThis has to be the most annoying problem Ive ever encountered with XPages as I can find no reason why a successful QuerySave or even a failure because mandatory fields werent filled in would cause the page to refresh like this and lose the content. Please please can someone help point me in the right direction p

Negative 926 pI am developing an orientation controller. I have a development board which communicates with the sensor a compass through I2C. Because the board is pretty limited no OS, I developed a simple program to receive things like 1 get 0 to read the sensors register 0 2 set 0 10 to set the sensors register 0 with the value 10. For each of these cases the board returns 1 Done 10. register 0 has the value 10 2 Done. and 3 error ... in case of error.

Negative 926 pI have read lots of arguments about not using codethrowXcode in function signatures, and I think the way its specified in ISO C and implemented in current compilers its rather useless. But why compiler cannot simply strongenforcestrong exceptioncorrectness at compile time p  pIf I write functionmethod definition that contains codethrowA,B,Ccode in its signature, the compiler should not have many problems in figuring out if implementation of given function is exceptioncorrect. That means that function body hasp  ul lino codethrowcodes other than codethrow A throw B throw Ccodeli lino functionmethod call that have throwsignatures less restrictive than codethrow A,B,Ccodeli ul  p, at least outside codetrycatchcode catching other thrown types. If compiler raises error if these requirements are not met, then all functions should be safe and no runtime functions like codeunexpectedcode would be required. All this would be assured at compiletime.p  precodevoid fooA throw A   void fooAB throw A,B   void fooABC throw A,B,C    void bar throw A      throw A    ok     throw B    Compiler error      fooA       ok     fooAB      compiler error     fooABC     compiler error      try        throw A    ok        throw B    ok        throw C    Compiler error         fooA    ok        fooAB   ok        fooABC  compiler error      catch B  codepre  pThis would require that all nonC realm code was either codethrowcode specified by default codeextern Ccode should assume it by default, or if there is some exception interoperability then appropriate headers for C at least should be codethrowcodespecified as well. Failure to do so could be compared to using headers with different functionmethod return type in different compilation units. While its not producing warnings or errors, its obviously wrong  and as thrown exceptions are part of signature, they should also match.p  pIf we enforce such constrains it would have three effectsp  ul liIt would remove all those implicit codetrycatchcode blocks, otherwise required for runtime checking, thus improving exceptionhandling performance.li liThe argument that Exceptions are making our library too big, so we switch them off would disappear, as most of additional code lies in those unnecessary implicit throwcatch instructions at every function call. If code was properly codethrowcodespecified, most of it wouldnt be added by compiler.li liIt would make most of the programing world furious, as nobody ever seemed to like exceptions. Now, as these are actually usable, we need to learn how to use them.li ul  pIf we used some compatibility compiler flags for older code it wouldnt break anything, but as new exceptioncode would be quicker, there would be a good motivation not to write new code using it.p  pTo summarize my question Why such enforcement is not required by ISO C Are there any strong reasons for it not to be I always thought that exceptions are just another functions return value, but one that is governed automatically, so you can avoid writing functions likep  precodestdpairltint, boolgt str2intstdstring s int str2intstdstring s, bool ok codepre  pplus additional autodestruction of variables and propagation through multiple functions up the stack so you dont need code likep  precodeint doThis      int err0      [...]      if err  doThat         return err           [...]   codepre  pand if you can require function to codereturncode only the correct type, why cant you require it to codethrowcode itp  pWhy cant exception specifiers be better Why werent they made like I described from the startp  pPS I know there might be some issues with exceptions and templates  depending on answers to this question perhaps i will ask another one about it  for now let us just forget templates.p  pstrongEDITstrong in response to NicolBolasp  blockquote   pWhat kind of optimization could the compiler do with exception class X that it couldnt do with Yp blockquote  pComparep  precodevoid fooA throw A   void fooAB throw A,B   void fooABC throw A,B,C    void bar throw       try        fooA           if exception  A goto Acatch        fooAB           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch        fooABC           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch          catch A   Acatch       [...]          catch B   Bcatch       [...]          catch C   Ccatch       [...]       codepre  pandp  precodevoid fooA   void fooAB   void fooABC    void bar      try        fooA           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch           if exception  other return exception        fooAB           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch           if exception  other return exception        fooABC           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch           if exception  other return exception          catch A   Acatch       [...]          catch B   Bcatch       [...]          catch C   Ccatch       [...]       codepre  pHere I included some pseudocode that compiler would have generated no assembly level.

The consumer threads are split into a receiver thread and worker threads.p  pThe consumer receiver thread executes recv and upon receive passes the message to be consumed by the consumer worker which after performing the computation, sends the processed message back to the Producerroot.p  pI am running this code on my dual core machine. What I am noticing is that when I execute my application using codempirun np 2code, the application is performing just fine for any number of generated messages by the producer. When I try running the application with codempirun np 4code, the application crashes after processing a couple of runs.p  pHas somebody encountered this issue before It would be great to get some insight into why this might be happening.p  pEdit Heres the exception that I get everytime I run my run my applicationp  precode glibc detected  application free invalid pointer 0x00007f67d1f9f9e0   Backtrace  libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.60x7e626[0x7f67d0671626] usrlibopenmpilibopenmpimcapmlob1.so0x9041[0x7f67cc790041] usrlibopenmpilibopenmpimcapmlob1.so0x5a00[0x7f67cc78ca00] usrliblibmpi.so.0MPIRecv0x154[0x7f67d1d531e4] usrlocalliblibboostmpi.so.1.50.0ZN5boost3mpi6detail19packedarchiverecvEP19ompicommunicatortiiRNS015packediarchiveER20ompistatuspublict0x33[0x7f67d1fcb223] usrlocalliblibboostmpi.so.1.50.0ZNK5boost3mpi12communicator4recvINS015packediarchiveEEENS06statusEiiRT0x45[0x7f67d1fc4755] applicationZNK5boost3mpi12communicator9recvimplI7MessageEENS06statusEiiRTN4mpl5boolILb0EEE0x74[0x464d98] applicationZNK5boost3mpi12communicator4recvI7MessageEENS06statusEiiRT0x3b[0x46479b] applicationZN12WorkerReceiver3runEv0xac[0x46b1da] usrlocalliblibPocoFoundation.so.12ZN4Poco10ThreadImpl13runnableEntryEPv0x96[0x7f67d26fcb16] libx8664linuxgnulibpthread.so.00x7e9a[0x7f67d09b7e9a] libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.6clone0x6d[0x7f67d06e54bd] codepre  pThanks p

Negative 926 pIm creating an HTML5 canvas 3D renderer, and Id say Ive gotten pretty far without the help of SO, but Ive run into a showstopper of sorts. Im trying to implement backface culling on a cube with the help of some normals calculations.

Negative 926 pThe most recent version of the Instagram iOS app does something interesting.

To check for page faults, see the extrainfo.pagefaults value in the serverStatus command. This data is only available on Linux systems.p      pAlone, page faults are minor and complete quickly however, in aggregate, large numbers of page fault typically indicate that MongoDB is reading too much data from disk and can indicate a number of underlying causes and recommendations. In many situations, MongoDBs read locks will yield after a page fault to allow other processes to read and avoid blocking while waiting for the next page to read into memory. This approach improves concurrency, and in high volume systems this also improves overall throughput.p      pIf possible, increasing the amount of RAM accessible to MongoDB may help reduce the number of page faults. If this is not possible, you may want to consider deploying a shard cluster andor adding one or more shards to your deployment to distribute load among mongod instances.p blockquote  pSo, I tried the recommended command, which is terribly unhelpfulp  precodePRIMARYgt db.serverStatus.extrainfo      note  fields vary by platform,     heapusagebytes  36265008,     pagefaults  4536924  codepre  pOf course, I could increase the server size more RAM, but that is expensive and seems to be overkill. I should implement sharding, but Im actually unsure what collections need sharding Thus, I need a way to isolate where the faults are happening what specific commands are causing faults.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 926 pHello and thanks for reading,p  pIve recently been working on a project involving popular music. I initially went into this knowing that Billboard.com had an API for accessing the archives of all of their charts. Well, as it turns out this API is no longer maintained or never was completed, because it does not work. Looking through stackoverflow Ive seen similar questions, most answering with a link to their RSS. The RSS is helpful, but Im more concerned about charts from the past and this only shows the current.p  pIve found a couple of websites that have the primary charts from Billboard, The Hot 100 singles and the Hot 100 Albums but nothing comprehensive, I need all the charts and their archives.p  pThis doesnt seem like too much to ask, but I cant find the data anywhere. I dont know if anyone has had to work on something similar and has a few ideas of where to get the data or can at least point me in the correct direction.p  pAny information is really appreciated, Ive been looking for several days now with no luck.p  pIN SHORT I need a comprehensive data source of the Billboard Music Archives for each of the charts they have. The data can be scraped from html, json, xml, database, I dont mind.p  pThanks for reading, I hope to hear from some of you out there.p

I have to strongassumestrong a FIFO is a nonqueued, nonbuffered mechanism and only works when there is a process sitting and waiting for data.p  pIs there a different communication mechanism that works in a nonblocked buffered manor, basically a buffered FIFO, or would I have to make my own message storagenotification system for thatp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI say Im playing around which is actually pretty descriptive here.

Reason being its part of a communications driver Im analyzing for port to a new platform. br I excluded this from the original post as it is sort of irrelevant. Im just trying to make sure I can understand at the moment FIFOs, how to use them, the limitations on them, and other IPC mechanism. Hence my original assumptionquestions about better versions of FIFO that will store data and can be written to without blocking.p

Negative 926 pI wanted to confirm if this is possible. I want to publish User To User Requests directly to the open graph action with my own UI  specifically the friend selector.p  pMy friend selector does follow the platform guidelines ie do not allow users to select all users at once. My question is that can I publish these requests directly without having to use any of the FB UIs including the request dialog preview we are going to show our own preview.p  pThis is to be built on iOS. The primary reason we want to use our own UI is because our design team feel that the popups hinder UX on mobile and they want to make it seamless.

We know Name exists as a column because the sql statement that is run is always pretty much hard coded into there with no ambiguity or cleverness going on.p  pAny thoughts related to the problem There are some work arounds, using the int indexer, most of these queries return one or two columns only.

Negative 926 pI have a form which contains a table with two columns. Each row has a checkbox and an input field. While the checkbox is for deletion of the specific row, the input field is for massediting of the values. Each input field uses bean validation. Additionally I have two buttons one for delete and one for save. Everything is based on primefaces.p  precodelthformgt     ltpdataTable valuebackingBean.list varentry idtablegt         ltpcolumngt             ltpselectBooleanCheckbox valueentry.flagDelete gt         ltpcolumngt          ltpcolumngt             ltpinputText valueentry.value gt         ltpcolumngt     ltpdataTablegt      ltpcommandButton valuesave actionListenerbackingBean.save processtable this updatetable gt      ltpcommandButton valuedelete actionListenerbackingBean.delete process[typecheckbox] this updatetable gt lthformgt codepre  pprocess equals execute and update equals render in JSF 2p  pNow it should be possible to delete the selected rows without the validation of the input fields. Therefore I used the primfaces ajax selectors based on jQuery selector API to select only the checkboxes, that should be processed during the ajax request. The values of the input fields are still send to the server but wont be processed. p  pThe problem is the rerender of the table after the ajax request. I want the input fields to preserve the values that got entered before the deletebutton was clicked in case the user did not save his changes with the savebutton. As those values got send to the server, this shouldnt be such a big deal e.g. when the validation fails, I also get the last entered values. But actually I get the values, that are stored in the backing bean. Is there any optionsolution on how to achieve thisp

I want to change it to redirection because as I understand this approach of rewriting multiple urls to the same url is penalized by most of the search engines.p  pFor rewriting I edited the .htaccess file.

Negative 926 pWe have a gidview on a page with a selection of text boxes, each text box has a TextChanged event that updates its corresponding value in a database.p  pThe page contains a button that when pressed causes a postback and the text changed events fire and all is ok.p  pWhen a selected index on a dropdown is changed the grid is rebound but the text changed events do not fire.p  pThe grid is also rebound in the button click event as well but it seems the text changed events fire before the button click but the selected index event fires before the text changed events, I think rebinding the grid has cause the text changed events to be ignored or removed from the control. p  pCan anyone shed light on this matter. The grid needs to be auto saving itself as the user navigates around.p  pThanksp

Negative 926 pI am trying to request additional permissions at the time of a facebook login using Facebooks suggested Javascript SDK. I am using the scope parameter to make the additional request as a part of the FB.login. My chrome browser has blocked popups. When I load the page containing the FB.login and the scope parameters into my browser, Chrome blocks the automatic popup. When I then click on an html button to perform the facebook login and authorization request, the only permissions that the fb popup shows is the one for basic info. However, if I allow popups, then when I load the page, a facebook authorization popup automatically displays without the need to click on the button to launch the fb login.

Optionally, if the moderator wants to establish their own link for a page as an easier means of navigation, they can do so by giving value to the Page.link column for example a hrefhttpwww.example.compotc relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotca for the movie emPirates of the Caribbeanem.p  pI have my routes all set up which took some time in itself. The route checks to see if the first parameter of the URL after .com matches the link column of any page, if it does, route to that page and the controllersactions under it. If not, route as usual.p  pWhen a user is viewing either a hrefhttpwww.example.compotcarticles99 relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotcarticles99a or a hrefhttpwww.example.commovies106articles99 relnofollowhttpwww.example.commovies106articles99a given that emPirates of the Caribbeanem is page with id  106 then the user is directed to the articles controller, view action, id  99. 106 is passed as pageid to the controllers action and also set in the AppController.p  pThe URL array Im providing in the controller works fine for example if the id does not exist I redirect to codecontroller gt articles, action gt index, pageid  pageidcode. I am redirected back to a hrefhttpwww.example.compotcarticles relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotcarticlesa. I dont actually have to define the controller since by default it uses the current controller.p  pHowever, Im having an issue with the pagination links. Say for example Im on the articles index page and there are 100 articles but Im only viewing the first 20. I would like the URL to be outputted as a hrefhttpwww.example.compotcarticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.compotcarticlespage2a. p  pInstead, if I set the URL array as codecontroller gt articles, action gt index, pageid gt pageidcode similar to what I did in the controller I get the link a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticlespageid106page2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticlespageid106page2a I can understand why this route does not work because I probably have to pass along the value Page.link if it exists and if not pass along Category.directory and Page.id. Ive tried doing the latter option using the URL array codecontroller gt articles, action gt index, category gt page[Category][directory], pageid gt pageidcode. I have a route to match this but the pagination links are still generated as a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticlescategorymoviespageid106page2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticlescategorymoviespageid106page2ap  pHere are some snippets from my routes.php a hrefhttpsgist.github.com9ba0a54a7f4d68803d14 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com9ba0a54a7f4d68803d14ap  pMy question is strongCan I use the exact current URL for pagination links minus reference to current page I am onstrong For example, if Im viewing a hrefhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage2a, the pagination link will automatically go to a hrefhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage3 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutecontrolleridpage3ap  pI put all of my pagination code into an element and I would like to include the element in my view file wherever the pagination is needed.p  pRight now, if Im viewing the articles controller, index action, the default URL for the pagination links is a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticlespage2a, but I need it to be a hrefhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2ap  pI tried using the p  precode   thisgtPaginatorgtoptions  array                     url gt httpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticles      codepre  pBut the link is output like a hrefhttpwww.example.comarticleshttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comarticleshttpwww.example.comdynamicroutearticlespage2ap  pstrongEditstrong Jeztah, you mention putting p  blockquote   pcustomlink    [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1p blockquote  pin my route. Well I cant simply do this because the route does a query to check to see if the customlink is in the database and if so routes accordingly.p  pAn example of my router file isp  pafter getting first param of url which would be a hrefhttpwww.domain.com relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comastrongCUSTOMLINKstrong, do the followingp  precodeifparam1  users ampamp param1     pagelink  strreplace,  , param1      pagesModel  ClassRegistryinitPage     matchedpage  pagesModelgtfindfirst, array         conditions gt arrayPage.link LIKE gt pagelink, recursive gt 1           ifmatchedpage[Page][id]         Routerconnect . param1 . controller, arrayaction gt index, pageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid,             pageid gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                   Routerconnect . param1 . controlleractionid, arraypageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid, id,             pageid gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                    Routerconnect . param1 . controllerid, arrayaction gt view, pageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid, id,             pageid gt [09],             id gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                    Routerconnect . param1 . controlleraction, arraypageid gt matchedpage[Page][id], array             pass gt arraypageid,             pageid gt [09],             persist gt arraypageid,                 end if page matches   end if param1 is not users codepre  pIf I go to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesa, a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles1 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles1a, a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesedit1 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesedit1a, etc the proper page is display. If I try to navigate to a page where the customlink does not exist, continue down my router file and if no other route is matched then throw error message. All good there.p  pIn my ArticlesController.php the redirect method works as expected. Say for example, I try to go to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles99 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles99a but id 99 does not exist, I am properly redirected back to a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticles relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlesa using p  blockquote   pthisredirectarrayaction  index, pageid  pageid,   null, truep blockquote  pHowever, on the pagination, I set the url options as p  blockquote   parraycontroller  articles, action  index, pageid    pageidp blockquote  pwhere pageid is set in the AppController from being passed by the Router. Though I dont need to set controller and action because the current will be used. Again, my pagination links appear as a hrefhttpwww.domain.comarticlespageid3page2 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comarticlespageid3page2a and not what I want which is a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlespage2 relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinkarticlespage2ap  pstrongEditstrong Jeztahp  pI just changed my entire route file to what you had with having a customlink parameter I renamed to link and then created a component for use in the app controller to get the page id from the link.p  pExample routep  precodeRouterconnectlinkcontrolleractionid, array, array     pass gt arraylink, id,     link gt [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1,     persist gt arraylink,    Routerconnectlinkcontrollerid, arrayaction gt view, array     pass gt arraylink, id,     link gt [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1,     id gt [09],     persist gt arraylink,  codepre  pHowever, paginating with the url array as codearraylink gt testexamplecode the url is outputted as codehttpwww.domain.comarticleslinktestexamplepage2code. My code is exactly as yours minus renaming customlink to link. Also, now my route cant differentiate between whether Im trying to access a hrefhttpwww.domain.comcustomlink relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comcustomlinka which would be controller  pages, action  view his page would basically use the News model and display the latest news for the page and if Im trying to access a hrefhttpwww.domain.comarticles relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comarticlesa which would be controller  articles, action  index which would display the latest articles for ALL pages. Note, articles and news are separate models.p  precodeRouterconnectlink, arraycontroller gt pages, action gt view, array     pass gt arraylink,     link gt [az09]1[az09]2,[az09]1,     persist gt arraylink,  codepre  pis the same as p  precodeRouterconnectcontroller, arrayaction gt index codepre  pbecause the check to see whether or not link belongs to a specific page is no longer done in the route.p  pstrongEditstrong Ok Im making progress.

Negative 926 pThis topic has been on my mind the last little while and I have been thinking about the efficiency for DOM updates relating to replacing  updating images. I havent been able to find a discussion on this specifically and I am not even sure if there is an ideal solution between the two options Ill show below.p  pThe best answer Ive come up with is that is it totally dependent on if you need to update additional attributes on the codeltimggtcode tag like the codealtcode, codewidthcode, codeheightcode values if they are being used.p  pOk, so say you want to update an image or do an image swap between two images, what do you believe is the most efficient or elegant way. Is it better to replace the codeltimggtcode element completely with a new codeltimggtcode element with an updated codesrccode or to only update the existing codeltimggtcodes codesrccode value with the new imagep  pThe example I have use small images, would performance be effected by image size or whatever.p  pThe two ways I have arep  precode.swapimageele.onclick, functionevt     var img1  img1.html     var img2  img2.html      img1.htmlimg2     img2.htmlimg1   .swapimagesrc.onclick, functionevt     var img1  img1 img.attrsrc     var img2  img2 img.attrsrc      img1 img.attrsrc, img2     img2 img.attrsrc, img1  codepre  p The quick working example Ive wrote showing the two options is here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjshawKMmeR relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjshawKMmeRap  pJust curious on everyones opinion or preference and if theres an ideal way of doing this.p

It seems that the bitmaps are cached using the URI set in the displayImage method as the key.

The reason for that is the id value is also used to load data in other places, so that value is unique for each image.p  pSo is there a way to change the key for the cached bitmap to something other than the URIp

Negative 926 pstrongThe Problemstrong During an installation process, files and folders are created, moved, and renamed. Services are also starting and stopping during installation, which can cause locking issues on one or more files or folders. I have a solution to avoid most locking scenarios, but would like a better approach that will not waste time or CPU, and will prevent the user from having to deal with an AbortRetryIgnore dialog as much as possible.p  pstrongThe Backgroundstrong In an optimal scenario, the logic handling the starting and stopping of services, and other operations that would place locks on files and folders would prevent locks from still existing by the time the createmoverename section of the installer occurs. In this case, I do not have control over those parts of the installation process, but I do need to avoid showing the user error dialogs as much as possible when files or folders are unable to be altered. p  pI am unable to simply loop for long periods of time since there are legitimate error cases where thirdparty applications are locking necessary resources, and we need to be able to promptly display this information to the user, and show them information regarding the offending processes. However, there are a lot of false positives in my use case, and I want to minimize user intervention.p  pMy current solutiuon looks something like thisp  precodeprivate const int MaxRetry  3 private const int RetryDelayMs  250  private static bool DoActionFileSystemAction action, String src, String dest        bool retval  false     bool inprogress  true       ReAttempt to perform the desired action until the user aborts.     while inprogress              try                       Automatically retry N times with a delay of M milliseconds.              This is meant to reduce the number of times a user sees an error dialog.             var autoretry  true             var retryCounter  0             while autoretry                              try                                       CODE Attempt to perform the file system action.                       Only get here if we succeeded.                     autoretry  false                                  catch Exception                                       If this operation failed, try a few times.                     if retryCounter gt MaxRetry                         throw                     retryCounter                     Thread.SleepRetryDelayMs                                             If we get here without exception, success             inprogress  false             retval  true                  catch Exception ex                       Since there was an error, we now do the following                 Determine if locked files are the cause.                 If locked files are the cause                     Show a custom Locked File dialog, providing information.                 Otherwise                     Select message string based on action to inform the user.                     Allow the user to RetryAbortIgnore the failed operation.               CODE Logic goes here.                    return retval  codepre  pI browsed several examples of handling locked files and failed file system operations on here when I first wrote this logic however, Im not content with this solution as it does not prevent the user from seeing the dialog in all false positive situations where there is a race condition. Any ideas on improving this without being able to rewrite the offending service logicp

Negative 926 pOne of the things I enjoy about Parse is the REST API which allows me to send push notifications to channels from an external website. I am curious if this, or something similar is available with Windows Azure Mobile Services.p  pFrom what I can see, the best way to achieve this result is to create a table which stores push notifications on the Azure Mobile Services. Override the onInsert node.js script to send a push when a record is inserted.  The insert is coming through the existing REST API which does allow me to interact with the tablet itself.p  pWhat I would like is the ability to provide, for example, my iOS Device Token to the API along with various application access credentials to a REST endpoint and use Mobile Services to send the notification on my behalf, while keeping the information on those clients in my own database hosted in SQL Azure or another location.p  pThanks for any insight.p  pJasonp
Negative 926 pIm new to iOS although I do have a lot of C experience and I am working on a turnbased card game using gamecenter. Heres the catch  The player whos turn it is is the judge and waits for all OTHER players to play a card before the turn is over. Is there a way to do this in Game Center, so all players chose what to do simultaneously and once all have done so, the judge is notified, makes a decision, and then passes priority to the next player For example, say we start turn 1. I ask the question, What is your favorite color to all players passing them a gamestate which has that as the question and them not having answered it. Then you respond, Green, and our friend Steve responds Blue. I then decide which is better, give one of you a point, and then whoever I gave the point becomes the new judge. My question is, how do I allow all players to respond simultaneously, rather than sequentially. I know that, worst case, I could sequentially loop around through players until it comes back to me, then judge it, but this would slow down my game and make it less fun. Is there a way to do this simultaneouslyp

I can verify the data is being sent to the Red5 server, and is being sent from the Red5 server back to the client viewing network traffic.

If you click on a colored box, a lightbox shows with the RBG color of the colored box clicked within the respected slide.  Click again to close the lightbox.  All while a 3D transform is applied before the light gray parent DIV, with position relative with overflow hidden, with Jquery animate on absolute positioning slide DIVs.p  pResults in Webkit The colored boxes within the slides dont appear to moverender at all until you resize the browser window on a desktop, or click the JSFiddle panel resize handle or pinchzoon on a tablet.

Another problem is created though.  The parent overflow DIV has a lower zindex than the lightbox, making the dark lightbox DIV appear above the white dialog DIV thats within the parent DIV.p  pI know this is a very weird example, but its a watered down example of more private complex code.  The 3D transform must be before the parent DIV, or within a slide.  The lightbox dialog must be within the parent DIV or slide, but appear above the dark lightbox DIV, which cant be within the parent DIV because the overflow hidden will not make the dark lightbox DIV appear full browser screen.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 926 pWe use a component implemented in a DLL. It is inherited from System.Windows.Forms.Control. We need to use it as keys in a .NET Hashtable object.p  pAs a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.hashtable.aspx relnofollowMSDN statesa,p  blockquote   pThe objects used as keys by a Hashtable are required to override the Object.GetHashCode method or the IHashCodeProvider interface and the Object.Equals method or the IComparer interface.p blockquote  pBut the control we are talking about does not have its own implementation of the GetHashCode method.

In complex sentences, however, there are multiple verbs, and thus multiple subjects and objects. It is possible to consider complex sentences like this as multiple sentences using the first part of the independent clause as the root, and replacing the second part with each of the dependent clauses, but usually the first clause is the most important and could be considered the main topic of the sentence.p  pDoing a simple BFS to find the first NP prior to a verb will result in officials being the subject, since it is at the lowest depth level. This doesnt capture the intuition of the first clause containing the subject. One approach I tried was searching for the NPs in the first base S node i.e., lowest level subtree rooted at an S node, but in this case that would capture nodes rooted at Ssub3sub.p

Ive found a lot of info about the theme on several sites and QampA right here, but I still have some lingering doubtsp  pIs the byte alignment the size of the data chunk read set systemwide, chosen by the compiler for the whole program, or specific for each structure in my code and if so, is it hardcoded on the binary And what exactly is exactly is the relation to the system architecture 32 vs 64 bit How could I find the value that I am currently using as default p
Negative 926 pIm having some dilemmas on how to process and handle checked exceptions that are thrown by my domain objects while using Tapestry to create the web GUI as a presentation layer.p  pAssume I have a domain object, codeFoocode that throws codeFooExceptioncode on one of its methodsp  precodepublic class Foo      ...     public void fooMethod throws FooException          ...          ...  codepre  pNow, assume I have a Tapestry page called codeBarcode where codeFoocode object is, for example, being edited with codeBeanEditorcode.p  pNow, to ensure illegal values are not passed to codeBeanEditorcode for creating codeFoocode object, I can think of two basic ways to do thatp  ol lipTapestry field validation using codeValidatecode annotation  p  pIn this case, if we can filter and check inputs via regexes or by limiting values or doing similar actions made available by codeValidatecode well get a nifty error message next to the field were editing and the submit will fail, thus making the user think about what he wrote there and how to fix it.pli lipCatching domain exception and doing actions based on it  p  pI assume this scenario offers more options regarding what can and cannot be done. For example, if the used needs to enter codeURLcode and makes a mistake while doing so, the codeURLcode constructor will throw its own codeMalformedURLExceptioncode. We can catch that exception in our Java code, but my question is, what to do next and howpli ol  pDoes Tapestry offer any special mechanisms of handing domain exceptions checked andor unchecked, other than that exception window that pops up when things break apartp  pAre there any patterns on how to solve this particular problemp  pWhere do you draw the limit between common and ordinary exceptions like codeIndexOutOfBoundsExceptioncode and some domainspecific ones like codeFooExceptioncodep  pDp

Negative 926 pI am using FB login on my mobile app because I dont want users to create an account and enter redundant information like name, age, city, and so on. The user gives access to the app on the mobile device, and the device receives a FB access token. p  pI was wondering if I could send the same access token to my Ruby on Rails server through its REST API and then get the server to access users profile and retrieve all information and return it to client later.p  pAny information on how to go about it would be helpful. Thanksp  pPS. Another approach I could take was to retrieve user info on the client, and then ask the user to create a password. This would mean that the server is FBagnostic, but the user will have to remember one more password, and log in using that every time he uses the app. I wanted to avoid that.p

Ill refer to codegridShizzlecode as the emsecond grid,em because it is defined second and comes second in the DOM. Both grids are created with the correct and different IDs and exist in the DOM. Clearly, I have two grids, with different IDs and these are functioning as expected apart from as follows.p  pstrongWhen I try to select a cell in the second grid, as shown in the last two lines of the code above, it makes the selection in the first grid gridWibble.

Negative 926 pWhat is the best way to handle the following situation in Cp  pI have a server application written in CC.p  pFor example It creates a codeunsigned charcode buffer with length code256code. In this buffer the server stores the data the client sends to it. After storing, there are some cryptography checks with the received buffer.p  pIm writing a client for this server in C.p  pThe problem is the buffer the server is expecting at fixed length of 256.p  pWhen I create a codebyte[]code array with content and total length of 256 the cryptography checks are failing.p  pThe reason I found out is simple. The server expects a buffer of 256 bytes long. For example if the message is codeHello Worldcode, the rest of the buffer has to be 0padded. Or, better explained the bytes need to be codeunsigned 204code or  codesigned 52code.p  pI think this is a CC concept issueproblem.p  pTo solve my problem, I am setting that value explicitly.p  precodepublic static byte[] GetCBufferthis byte[] data, int len      byte[] tmp  new byte[len]     forint i  0 i lt len i         ifi lt data.Length             tmp[i]  data[i]         else             tmp[i]  204     return tmp  codepre  pAre there better ways to work with these art expected bytes Am I not seeing something essentialp
Negative 926 pIn the mobile app for Wikipedia, they have a dropdown effect where if you click on the line, it opens up the content for that line and inserts it into the page. For example, lines might be Career, Business Life, and Personal Life, and if you click on, for example, the Career line, it inserts the content for Career between the the Career and Business Life lines. If you click on the Career line again, the Career content disappears and you are back to just the one line. I want my content to be in HTML format, so I am assuming that I need to do this with UIWebView somehow, probably in conjunction with UITableView. How would I create an effect like thatp

On this new server, the ASP code is not running.p  pNow, the one option I have is to rewrite all the ASP code into PHP, but its honestly not an option I really want to do.

Negative 926 pI recently developed a web app with jquery, which now needs to be consumed on mobile devices ipad specifically.

Negative 926 pstrongNOTE See the end of this post for final explanation.strong  p  pThis is probably a very basic question, but Im still trying to master a few of the fundamentals regarding references in Perl, and came across something in the perldsc page that Id like to confirm.  The following code is in the Generating Array of Arrays sectionp  precodewhile  ltgt      push AoA, [ split ]   codepre  pObviously, the codeltgtcode operation in the codewhilecode loop reads one line of input in at a time.  I am assuming at this point that line is then put into an anonymous array via the code[ ]code brackets, well call this codezerocode. Then the split command places everything in a given line separated by whitespace within the array e.g., the first word is assigned to codezero[0]code, the second to codezero[1]code and so on. The scalar reference of codezerocode is then pushed onto codeAoAcode.p  pThe next line of input is passed via the codeltgtcode operator and gets assigned to a completely new anonymous array e.g. codeonecode, and its scalar reference is pushed onto codeAoAcode.p  pOnce codeAoAcode is populated, I could then access its contents with a nested codeforeachcode loop the first iterating through the rows e.g. codefor row AoAcode, and a second, inner loop, codeforeachcode to access the columns of that particular row. p  pThe latter accessing said columns would be done by codedereferencingcode e.g., codefor column rowcode the particular coderowcode being read by the previous, outer codeforeachcode loop.br Is my understanding correct  Im assuming you could still access any element of the AoA just as you would if it were assigned vs. being anonymous That is codeelement  AoA[8][1]code .p  pIm want to verify my thought process here. Is the automatic declaration of a unique, anonymous array each time through the loop part of the codeautovivicationcode in Perl I guess that is what is throwing me off a bit. Thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong Based on the comments below my understanding regarding the anonymous array is still unclear, so I want to take a shot at one more description to see if it meets everyones understanding.p  pStarting with the codepush AoA, [split]code statement, split takes in the line from  and returns a strongliststrong parsed by whitepace.  That strongliststrong is captured by code[ ]code, which then returns an array reference.  That array reference created by code[ ]code is then pushed onto AoA.  Is this accurate re code[ ]code The next step dereferencing  use of AoA was covered very well by krico below.p  pstrongFINAL ANSWEREXPLANATIONstrong Based on all of the comments  feedback here, some further research on my part, and testing it seems my understanding was correct.  Ill break it down here, so others can easily reference it later.  See kricos response below for a more explicit code representation that follows the steps outlined here.p  precodewhile  ltgt       push AoA, [ split ]  codepre  ol liOne line of input is passed at a time to the codeltgtcode operatorli liThe codesplitcode function takes that line in via codecode and parses it based on whitespace the default.li licodesplitcode then returns a LIST.li liThe code[ ]code is an anonymous array that provides the perl data structure for the List passed by codesplitcode.li liThe codepush AoAcode pushes the reference to the anonymous array onto its queue as element codeAoA[0]code the second anonymous array reference will be put into AoAa hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgperlref.html relnofollow titlePerl References1a, etc....li liThis continues through the entire input file.  Once completed, codeAoAcode is a 2D array, holding reference values scalar values to each of the previously generated anonymous arrays.li liFrom this point codeAoAcode can be dereferenced appropriately to work with the underlyingreference elements taken in from the input file.

Negative 926 pThis is a question in 2dimensional computational geometry.p  pSuppose I have a compact set X in the plane which has no holes i.e. it is emsimply connectedem. Let w be a vector, and consider the intersection of X with Xw i.e. the translate of X by w. I say that this intersection is emcomplicatedem if the following is truep  ol liX intersects Xwli liIf we let Y be the simplyconnected region obtained from X union Xw by filling in the bounded holes, then as we walk around the boundary of Y we can find 4 points in cyclic order a,b,c,d on the boundary so that a and c are in X but not in Xw, while b and d are in Xw but not in X.li ol  pJust for the sake of brevity, lets refer to the set of w for which the intersection of X with Xw is emcomplicatedem as the emconcave hullem of X note this has nothing to do with alpha sets its just a name. p  pI would like to know a fast, practical algorithm to compute the concave hull of X where X is say a polygonal disk. Beyond this, I would be interested in an elegant characterization of the concave hull perhaps in different terms. Finally, I would be very grateful for pointers to any literature discussing this problem.p  pHere are some remarksp  ol liThe concave hull of X is empty if and only if X is convex hence the name this is because if X is convex, and X intersects Xw, then the boundary of Y falls into exactly two components, one of which is in X, and the other in Xw the converse follows from point 3 below.li liThe concave hull of a polygon should be an open polygon i.e. with the boundary removed, so the answer could be given for example as a finite union of open triangles.li liIf X is nonconvex, we can find part of the concave hull as follows let L be a supporting line for X which intersects X in two sets P and Q with a gap I between them. If J is the segment of the boundary of X between P and Q, then the union of I and J bounds an open disk D in the complement of X, and if p is the extreme point of P closest to Q, then Dp is in the concave hull. Call the union of such regions over all supporting lines the eminner concave hullem it seems relatively easy to compute, but I think it should be smaller than the concave hull in general.li ol

Negative 926 pIm going to design a database for my website, my website will have many users and each user have a Sub Domain of my site like a weblog. each user can write article on hisher blog and other users can write some comments for that post.br this is my question, What is the best design for Database, is it better that I create a table for each sub domain a table for each user that contain that user posts or create single table for every usersbr I search to find answer but I give different answers some body told that save all data in a single table because you can write more efficient queries, but some body told save each users data in a separate table because you will reduce rows count and you can search data so fast.br so I dont know witch one i better and why and please tell the reason please.br for example what does codefacebookcode do to save users data does every one has a separate table or all users data posts are in a single tablebr some body told me that if I use multiple table instead of single table I can use several servers for my database, because each server can easily save some of tables but if save all users data in a single table then using two servers is more difficult.p

Negative 926 pI am plotting a line with matplotlib, and I use an animation. Lets say there isp  precodeline1,  ax.plot[], [], lw2, label1 codepre  pMy Animation is done with a FuncAnimation. Now I do have a problem. I am plotting Values of Angles in a Range from 0 to 360. But the input values can be larger. If they are larger, I use modulo to bring them down to my range. Bad thing is When I come across a line with angle values like 358, 359, 360, 361, the values on my plot are 358, 359, 0, 1. This works as intended, but the plotted line has a connection from my 359 to 0 value. Is there a way to suppress this So lets say, draw a line from 357, 358. 359, and then continue at the bottom of my plot at 0, 1, 2, and not draw this vertical connection line between 359 and 0p  pEDITp  pI found a workaround for this problem I do have enough values that are close enough to each other, so i can use point markers instead of a full line. But this is only a small solution for the problem, if your values are not as close to each other as mine are, you will only have random points in your plot. Here is what I didp  precodeline1,  ax.plot[], [],., lw2, label1 codepre  pEDIT2p  pI am now using simple plotting instead of animations. Can anybody pls tell me how you can split a line if you do not want it to connect from the bottom to the top of your plot or vice versap

Negative 926 pI am really new to Mongo DB after spending a few years in the relational DB camp. I understand the idea of NoSQL, but somehow, I cant make myself envision anything more than using it for caching and fast retrieval of data. p  pI have a typical manytomany situation to solve. Items get added to collections,  where multiple items can fit in one collection,  and vice versa. How can I solve this using Mongo DB, without duplicating the data On the other hand, I would also like to avoid creating a collection full of ids only,  because afterwards Id have to fetch the items one by one. If thats the case,  Id even drop Mongo and go back to a more relational solution. p  pIs there anything that Im missing with Mongo If thats the case,  please let me know. Id be glad to learn. p

This produces the correct script in the live page source, but the slider still doesnt work.

Negative 926 pThe IEnumerable in question is a list of an object containing filenames and properties relating to those file names, and the string is a directory name, such as CTestTesting. My goal is to store these two pieces of data together so that theyre linked, in a sense, which should make them easier to use together, as the IEnumerable will become the source for a DataGrid, and the string the text of a label stating the current directory. p  pHow would I go about achieving this I initially thought of a dictionary, but that doesnt seem to work here.

For example, assume we want to test a function codefooBarcode that always has to return code56code.p  pIn such a case I would do codeassertEqualssth.fooBar, 56code. But with a quick search on a hrefhttpsgithub.comsearchljavaampqassertEqualsamprefsimplesearchamptypeCodeamputf8E29C93 relnofollowGitHuba it seems people do it the other way around, so codeassertEquals56, sth.fooBarcode. But how can the expected value be codesth.fooBarcode when we dont even know that value It seems that codesth.fooBarcode is the actual value which we compare against the expected which we already know.p  pI know there is no difference of the correctness of a test but I would like to follow the correct way.p

Negative 926 pIm trying to implement an AJAX script that will be responsible for checking for new data on my MySQL server and updating a list if new data exist. The one solution that I found is to have a timer to checking any given time, which works, but because on my system im going to have more than 50 online users at the same time, they will execute this script and I will have an impact on the processing time of  my MySQL server. The second solution is to use Comet model but in order to update the A form I have to link somehow the B form to inform the server that new data has been inserted in order for the server to send a response to A form to inform it that new data have been added, which i dont want to link the B form with the server. Is there any different scenario that I can use in order for limiting the processing time, overloading the server ,minimize the performance and not reaching the max MySQL connections on my server for checking for new data. p  pThank youp
Negative 926 pIm using the set scale and segmented line tools in ImageJ to make linear measurements on a photograph.

I would rather some other action aside from left click result in the line being cleared, such as a right click or a double click.

Negative 926 pAt first I know that similar questions have been posted and solved but I have tried a lot of them and no one is working in my case.p  pI have a Canvas 2D with drawed lines and I have implemented listeners to zoom, translate and pick lines this way p  precode    canvas.addEventListenermousedown,functionevt         document.body.style.mozUserSelect  document.body.style.webkitUserSelect  document.body.style.userSelect  none         lastX  evt.offsetX  evt.pageX  canvas.offsetLeft         lastY  evt.offsetY  evt.pageY  canvas.offsetTop         dragStart  ctx.transformedPointlastX,lastY         dragged  false         console.logMouseDown     ,false      canvas.addEventListenermouseup,functionevt         console.logMouseUP         dragStart  null         if dragged selectFraglines,getMousePoscanvas,evt,evt         zoomevt.shiftKey  1  1      ,false      canvas.addEventListenermousemove, functionevt      lastX  evt.offsetX  evt.pageX  canvas.offsetLeft     lastY  evt.offsetY  evt.pageY  canvas.offsetTop     dragged  true     if dragStart          var pt  ctx.transformedPointlastX, lastY         ctx.translatept.x  dragStart.x, pt.y  dragStart.y          Track translating         accX  parseIntpt.x  dragStart.x         accY  parseIntpt.y  dragStart.y         console.logtranslatedX accX translatedy accY          redraw        ,false   var scaleFactor  1.05 var zoom  functionclicks,evt     var pt  ctx.transformedPointlastX,lastY     ctx.translatept.x,pt.y     var factor  Math.powscaleFactor,clicks      currentZoom factor     console.logCurrentZoom currentZoom      ctx.scalefactor,factor     ctx.translatept.x,pt.y      redraw   var handleScroll  functionevt     var delta  evt.wheelDelta  evt.wheelDelta60  evt.detail  evt.detail  0     if delta zoomdelta,evt     return evt.preventDefault ampamp false   canvas.addEventListenerDOMMouseScroll,handleScroll,false canvas.addEventListenermousewheel,handleScroll,false codepre  pAll of them are working fine translating, zooming.. but picking a line only works if there isnt any zoom.

Because of the cross platform reason, tbb takes into my consideration.p  pi have found  Android build instructions in tbb source code. and i notice this script in tbbbuildmacos.incp  precodeifeq ios,target    ifneq armv7, arch    error arch not supported for target ios endif codepre  pso TBB only support armv7 architecture and opencv seems not use TBB in IOS too.p  precodeNSLogd, cvgetNumThreads  return 512, GCD number  codepre  pdoes TBB support IOS well  armv7,armv7s,arm64 or i just should use boostthread or stlthread for crossplatform reason  if it supports, how should i build the libraryp
Negative 926 pI am working on an ELKstack configuration. logstashforwarder is used as a log shipper, each type of log is tagged with a typetagp    pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecode   network      servers [  ],     ssl ca ,     timeout 15   ,   files [            paths [         varlogsecure       ],       fields           type syslog               ]  codepre  pThat part works fine... Now, I want logstash to split the message string in its parts luckily, that is already implemented in the default grok patterns, so the logstash.conf remains simple so farp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeinput      lumberjack          port gt 6782         sslcertificate gt  sslkey gt        filter      if [type]  syslog          grok              match gt [ message, SYSLOGLINE ]                output      elasticsearch          cluster gt          template gt          templateoverwrite gt true         nodename gt logstash         bindhost gt        codepre  pThe issue I have here is that the document that is received by elasticsearch still holds the whole line including timestamp etc. in the message field. Also, the timestamp still shows the date of when logstash has received the message which makes is bad to search since kibana does query the timestamp in order to filter by date... Any idea what Im doing wrongp  pThanks, Danielp

Negative 926 pI wanted to convert my simulation code in Matlab to C and run it with a C compiler such as Visual Studio or g. I modified my code to successfully build a C project using Matlab Coder.  The coder returns a .prj file in the top project directory, and tens or hundreds of c sourceheaderobject files in the dll directory. I tried to open the .prj files with Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 I tried with both versions that was unsuccessful and they cannot even open a .prj file.  I have made sure to configure the Visual Studio as the C language compiler in Matlab using mex setup.  Does anyone have any idea how to handle the .prj and the subsequent files with Visual Studio or g I dont want to make it executable at the moment I just want to run it with either compilers and make sure its working.

Negative 926 pThis might be a dupe but I havent found an answer that solves my problem exactly.p  pLets say that I have 3 states.p  pbaccountbbr  baccount.settingsbbr  baccount.usersbp  pI want a link to be active on both childstates so I have a link like sop  precodelta uisrefaccount uisrefactiveactivegt codepre  pAnd when i click this link, I want to redirect to the baccount.settingsb state. So I add a redirect in onEnter, but that only triggers the first time I click the link. So I click the link and get redirected to the baccount.settingsb state, but if I click it again, onEnter doesnt trigger so i get flung to the baccountb state, which is not what I want.p  pIve tried adding the logic in a state controller instead with the same result, Ive also tried to use the burlRouterProvider.whenb function to redirect but Ive run in to similar problems with that approach. p  pI feel as to Im missing a point somewhere and I should have gotcha moment but Ive been struggling with this a few days now and I cant seem to get it.p
Negative 926 pI was reading a blog recently that made a big deal about array data being stored contiguously specifically in Go, but it was my understanding that by definition, array data is stored contiguously. At least this is what all my algorithms and data structures study has led me to believe.p  pSo my question is, is array data stored contiguously in all programming languages And, specifically I want to talk about primitives like integers or in the case of Java where I can have an array of Objects, are the references to the objects stored contiguously in memory I know that the objects themselves can be anywhere.p
Negative 926 pi have a hrefhttpfullcalendar.io relnofollowfullcalendara set and am using a hrefhttpfullcalendar.iodocsdisplaydayRender relnofollowdayRendera function to enable or disable days according to user availability.

The way im thinking it, i should either access dayRender method again or access to something like a days array and set, one by one, availability. But I cant find a way to do neither of both.p  pIf you know a way to do it or you can think of a better approach id be glad to hear. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 926 pI am using NASM for compiling my ASM program and I am having trouble figuring out how to print an entire array on a single line without necessarily knowing how big the array is using a loop.  Whenever I create a loop with printf it prints the values on multiple lines instead of one line.

Negative 926 pI have been working on as assignment where WPF GUI is genereated at runtime. Runtime generated GUI is consumed by another wpf application. Template generator application allows to create GUI and save it as xml xaml is actually xml using XAMLWriter. Consumer application use XAMLReader to add tamplate on GUI. Now i want some sort of binding among controls in generated template. p  pRequirement  Date on first Datepicker  20150102 and textbox Text  1 then date on second datepicker must be 20150103. If textbox text  1 the date on second date picker must have 20150101.p  pHow i could achieve this at runtime. Nothing needs to hard code as generated template is generated from another application. We have some specific values on Tag property of control which indicates us which three controls are involved and which datepicker is source ,which datepicker is destination and which textbox text needs to used.p  pIs it possible to use Dynamic data binding or how this can be accomplishedp

Negative 926 pI was reading the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2extendingembedding.html relnofollowembedding guidea, which tells you how to embed static python methods and compilerun them in a c program. I got some static code to run but what Im wondering, is that since its possibly to embed a dynamic language in C, can you just force whatever is running in the process to pause and embed the whole python interpreterp  pThe goal here would be to run any methods that have already been defined in the C program from the python interpreter. Its not clear to me if its possible to embed the interpreter so to make this happen. Is there a specific version to make this workp  pThe closest thing the guide talks about is a runtime argument being passed, where Im looking for a way to suspend operations in the middle of execution until I enter a python statement.p

Negative 926 pIve been developing a cross platform application which until recently has caused a few headaches. Android release will load the plugins without any issue at all, however, the iOS seems to have drop.

Negative 926 pThis quite a basic questionp  pI am making a game in Java which uses a lot of functions. The game starts of with a Main Menu, known as p  precodevoid MainMenuthrows IOException codepre  pThis is where the user inputs his name, and decides whether to start the game or not. Another function called p  precodevoid GameExethrows IOException codepre  pis the main function of the game which plays the game. It is called in the Main Menu function when the user starts the game, as in p  precodevoid MainMenuthrows IOException   ifStartgame  Yes   GameExe    codepre  pNow this GameExe is the heart of the game. It has a lot of nested loops. When the user wins the game,  I need terminate the function and call the Main Menu function. The general structure is p  precodevoid GameExethrows IOException  whiletrue  .................................... ................. if player1 wins game  print  YOU HAVE WON THE GAME  MainMenu  else if player1 has not won  print ...... ......................   block of statements  block of statements   codepre  pThe compiler says that it is impossible. Help would be appreciated.p
Negative 926 pI am using camshift in opencv with my project,and use the demo camshift code below,but the performance is very uncomfortable I try it with pets 2001 dataset test video,for example, you drag a box over a walking man to initialize tracking window,but when the man walks near a car,the tracking rectangle jump to the car and stay there. I am so depressed can anyone tell me what cause the instability it looks that the camshift algorithm in opencv is not the original algorithm,it caculate the backproject image s mass centor instead of caculating their probability density.so is it the keypoint p  precode  include stdafx.h include opencvcv.h include opencvhighgui.h include ltstdio.hgt include ltctype.hgt   IplImage image  0, hsv  0,

Negative 926 pusing thermal printer to print image containing two graphs width is 384pixel wide as it is expected from the printer. a hrefhttpslearn.adafruit.comminithermalreceiptprinterbitmapprinting relnofollowAdafruit thermal printer linka states that thermal printer can just print binarymonochrome images.

I have following two choices.p  ol lipKeep all functions small enough including main parser function.  Pass the required parameters as strongpointer to structurestrong from the main parser function to helper functions. Individual Function will access parameter from structure and write the result to the structure.pli lipOne large main parser function 250 lines and other smaller functions. All required parameters will be local to main parser function.

Negative 926 pWe have an ExcelWorkbook 2013 that contains some datasets in one sheet, each is stored in one row. On another sheet there are some PivotTables that evaluate the datasets. Because every PivotTable has the same filters and the selected values should always be the same, the selection is copied to the other PivotTables as soon as they are applied to one PivotTable.  We run the evaluation about twice a year. This time, an error occured codeRuntime error 1004 unable to get the PivotFields property of the PivotTable classcode.

Negative 926 pIm subscribing to Adobe CC just for FB and Flash Pro. This bug seems undocumented but is hugely annoying. It has not always been this way  it developed over time, and for awhile if I toggled wifi and restarted it would work again. It is definitely not a workspace corruption Ive reinstalled FB, Ive tried different workspaces. What happens is that when wifi is on, or as long as the computer is allocated an external IP, Flash Builder 4.7 works. If wifi is off, or if it fails to find a network, FB crashes before it tries to load the workspace.p  pInterestingly, if I create a wifi network, assigning my own box a 192.168.em.em address, FB launches. But if I turn off wifi while FB is open, it throws an error when I try to save files, and throws another error when I quit, saying it cant save the workspace. Its beyond me why, but FB is obviously failing readwrite in the absence of a nonlocal IP being allocated to the box.p  pThis happens even with a clean install and no projects or dependencies.p  pHas anyone encountered this one FWIW, Im also running Eclipse Helios and Kepler, as well as Flash Builder 4 on the same box for maintaining older code  plus Flash Pro and the rest of the CC without any problems. What is up with FB 4.7  I wish Adobe had just put out a damn Eclipse plugin instead of this pile of  Im paying 50 a month for. To be an IDE that fails whenever I cant get online.p  pI cant upgrade OS X on this box, but I doubt it would make a difference, since this is a Java error of some kind and FB hasnt been updated since 2013 or so anyway. It used to work. Unless I got infected with a worm thats trying to upload things I write, I dont see a reason it stopped unless some perms or base code got corrupted. Any insight would be welcome.p

Negative 926 pBackground Im working on a prototype system that uses a specialized datalinkphysical communication layer to send data back to a central server.p  pThe datalink layer uses fixedsize cells i.e. ATMlike for data transport, and can be inefficient when user data packets dont quantize perfectly into these cells.p  pProblem Ive looked through the available qdisc options for packet scheduling, and PRIO fits best, but does not do everything needed.  The required additional functionality is the ability to pull the next packet off the queue, perform some metric calculations on it, and then search the queue for additional packets that may fall within specific calculated size constraints and aggregate those as well.p  pIs there an easier builtin way to achieve this  If not, Im having trouble locating the source code algorithms for qdiscs and where I could start modifying codeunderstanding the feasibility.p  pThanksp

Negative 926 pI am new to Android and I want to know how to view mySQL database records in another activity via listview itemclick but it depends on the database primary key of the selected item in the listview.p  pIn other words, since the items in the listview are parsed from a database, each item will have a primary key. When you click that item, the user will go to another activity to view details about that particular item based on its primary key. How can I start a new activity based on the primary key of the list item selected Sample code would be much appreciated.p
