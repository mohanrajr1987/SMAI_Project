Positive 34113 pIm new to Cassandra and Im trying to define a data model that fits my requirements.p  pI have a sensor that collects one value every millisecond and I have to store those data in Cassandra. The queries that I want to perform arep  p1 Give me all the sensor values from  to these timestamp valuesp  p2 Tell me when this range of values was recordedp  pIm not sure if there exist a common schema that can satisfy both queries because I want to perform range queries on both values.

Negative 34113 pI have a library that readswrites to a USBdevice using CreateFile API. The device happens to implement the HIDdevice profile, such that its compatible with Microsofts HID class driver.p  pSome other application installed on the system is opening the device in readwrite mode with no share mode.

Negative 34113 pFor a governmental agency, we build a release management system developped in PHP and Oracle. The data for this application is stored in database tables and is processed with PLSQL packages and procedures.p  pThe release management process is extensively based on metadata coming from Subversion repositories.  We access the repositories from PLSQL through the internal Oracle JVM to execute svn commands on the unix server on which resides the Oracle instances.  The results from svn commands are received in XML and parsed before beeing processed by PLSQL.  Accessing Subversion this way is not very performant for frequent repeated use.p  pCurrently, what we do is storing the Subversion metadata in database tables at each commit in the Subversion repositories via Subversion hooks.  We extract the log information for each Subversion transaction and keep it in some oracle tables. We are then able to obtain Subversion metadata with normal SQL queries.p  pIs there better ways to access Subversion from PLSQL p

Negative 34113 pI have been noticing some very strange usage of O1 in discussion of algorithms involving hashing and types of search, often in the context of using a dictionary type provided by the language system, or using dictionary or hasharray types used using arrayindex notation.p  pBasically, O1 means bounded by a constant time and typically fixed space.  Some pretty fundamental operations are O1, although using intermediate languages and special VMs tends to distort ones thinking here e.g., how does one amortize the garbage collector and other dynamic processes over what would otherwise be O1 activities.p  pBut ignoring amortization of latencies, garbagecollection, and so on, I still dont understand how the leap to assumption that certain techniques that involve some kind of searching can be O1 except under very special conditions.p  pAlthough I have noticed this before, an example just showed up in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions330978propercollectiontousetoobtainitemsino1timeincnetPandincus question, Proper collection to use to obtain items in O1 time in C .NETa.p  pAs I remarked there, the only collection I know of that provides O1 access as a guaranteed bound is a fixedbound array with an integer index value.  The presumption is that the array is implemented by some mapping to random access memory that uses O1 operations to locate the cell having that index.p  pFor collections that involve some sort of searching to determine the location of a matching cell for a different kind of index or for a sparse array with integer index, life is not so easy.  In particular, if there are collisons and congestion is possible, access is not exactly O1.  And if the collection is flexible, one must recognize and amortize the cost of expanding the underlying structure such as a tree or a hash table for strikewhichstrike congestion relief e.g., high collision incidence or tree imbalance.p  pI would never have thought to speak of these flexible and dynamic structures as O1.  Yet I see them offered up as O1 solutions without any identification of the conditions that must be maintained to actually have O1 access be assured as well as have that constant be negligibly small.p  pTHE QUESTION All of this preparation is really for a question.  What is the casualness around O1 and why is it accepted so blindly  Is it recognized that even O1 can be undesirably large, even though nearconstant  Or is O1 simply the appropriation of a computationalcomplexity notion to informal use  Im puzzled.p  pUPDATE The Answers and comments point out where I was casual about defining O1 myself, and I have repaired that.  I am still looking for good answers, and some of the comment threads are rather more interesting than their answers, in a few cases.p

Negative 34113 pIm curious what strategy most of you are employing in order to build solid RESTful iPhone clients in respect to model hierarchies. What I mean by model hierarchies is that I have a REST server in which several resources have a correlation to each other. For instance, lets say for hypothetical purposes I have a REST server which spits out information about a school. If I want to grab all the students in a particular class, I first need to query the REST server for information on the school, then I need to query the server for information on all of the classes the school has to offer, followed by a subsequent request for all students in a particular class. At the end of the day, the client is bringing in 3 unique XML trees. At that point, do most of you folks write your own algorithms in order to build the final tree which will end up being your data source Do you not aggregate XML trees in this respect and instead use a different approachp  pHow do you prefer taking a myriad of related resources on the server and getting them into one tree that just makes sense onto the clientp  pThanks for the insight.p

Negative 34113 pI am currently developing an app that receives Push Notifications. I have this all working 100 through a PHP page. There are several different types of push notifications my app can receive.

I have got this working fine... structurally.p  pOne of my push types is supposed to open a UIView that makes several connections to several different servers and negotiates data back and forth.

If I follow mayers algorithm, I would end up with all nonmember friend functions. I will have a vector class with few private members and many nonmember friend functions. Is this what he is talking aboutp  pstrongQuestion 2strongp  pI am still not understanding how nonmember functions improve encapsulation. Consider the code given in meyers article.p  precodeclass Point  public    int getXValue const     int getYValue const     void setXValueint newXValue    void setYValueint newYValue  private   ...                  whatever...  codepre  pIf his algorithm is followed, codesetXXXXcode methods should be nonmember. My question is how that increases encapsulation He also saysp  blockquote   pWeve now seen that a reasonable way   to gauge the amount of encapsulation   in a class is to count the number of   functions that might be broken if the   classs implementation changes.p blockquote  pUntil we keep the method signature intact when class implementation changes, no client code is gonna break and it is well encapsulated, right The same applies for nonmember functions as well. So what is the advantage nonmember function providesp  pstrongQuestion 3strongp  pQuoting his algorithmp  precodeelse if f needs type conversions          on its leftmost argument        make f a nonmember function    if f needs access to nonpublic        members of C       make f a friend of C     codepre  pWhat he meant by emf needs type conversions on its leftmost argumentem  He also says the following in the article.p  blockquote   pFurthermore, we now see that the   common claim that friend functions   violate encapsulation is not quite   true. Friends dont violate   encapsulation, they just decrease it    in exactly the same manner as member   functions.p blockquote  pThis and the above algorithm are contradictory, rightp

Negative 34113 pI have a process where data is transferred from an Excel spreadsheet into SQL Server.  To do this, Ive created a dtsx using the SQL Server Import  Export Data wizard.p  pThe trouble is, the script could be run against any database.  But the wizard seems to default to using the format codeCREATE TABLE [Database].[dbo].[table]code when creating the script.  This means that the dtsxs codeDestinationConnectionOLEDBcode Connection Manager is worse than useless  you change it, thinking youve changed the end location that the script will run, only to find that the tasks still point to the original database.p  pWhat Ive been doing up till now is manually going in and findreplacing code[Database]code for the new name.  Sadly, it took me till emtodayem to realise that I probably could just findreplace code[Database].[dbo].code with an empty string largely because Ive had the dtsxs break a few of the times Ive meddled with them.p  pSo, is it possible to skip over the necessity of the final step and reduce the possibility Ill break something along the way by not including the code[Database].[dbo].code in the file in the first placep

Negative 34113 pI am writing a C unit test to test CCLI functionality that involves threads. p  pThe CCLI code implements a DirectShow filter, the Windows API for rendering movies. This works thus that I create DirectShow objects, I tell it to run an AVI through my CCLI filters, waits until rendering is done, and then exits. My filter has a callback that gives the video frames to C for processing. DirectShow works thus that it creates its own thread and calls my COM objects from this thread.p  pNow, this stuff works when I run my code normally, but when running a unit test from Resharper it fails with the error Cannot pass a GCHandle across AppDomains. p  pWhat appears to go wrong is that Resharper uses AppDomains in its testrunner, and the DirectShow thread is somehow not associated with this appdomain. p  pSo how do I make this test work from Resharper Is there a NUnitResharper setting to control if appdomains are used Can I tell the CLR somehow that a thread is assocated with a particular appdomain Do you know any other pragmatic workaroundsp  pTIA Janp

Negative 34113 pI have a freelance web application project where the client requests new features every two weeks or so.  I am unable to anticipate the requirements of upcoming features.  So when the client requests a new feature, one of several things may happenp  ol lipI implement the feature with ease because it is compatible with the existing platformpli lipI implement the feature with difficulty because I have to rewrite a significant portion of the platforms foundationpli lipClient withdraws request because it costs too much to implement against existing platformpli ol  pAt the beginning of the project, for about six months, all feature requests fell under category 1 because the system was small and agile.   But for the past six months, most feature implementation fell under category 2.  The system is mature, forcing me to refactor and test everytime I want to add new modules.  Additionally, I find myself breaking things that use to work, and fixing it I dont get paid for this.p  pThe client is starting to express frustration at the time and cost for me to implement new features.  To them, many of the feature requests are of the same scale as the features they requested six months ago.  For example, a client would ask, If it took you 1 week to build a ticketing system last year, why does it take you 1 month to build an event registration system today  An event registration system is much simpler than a ticketing system.  It should only take you 1 week  Because of this scenario, I fear feature requests will soon land in category 3.  In fact, Im already eating a lot of the cost myself because I volunteer many hours to support the project.p  pThe client is often shocked when I tell him honestly the time it takes to do something.  The client always compares my estimates against the early months of a project.   I dont think theyre prepared for what it really costs to develop, maintain and support a mature web application.p  pWhen working on a salary for a full time company, managers were more receptive of my estimates and even encouraged me to pad my numbers to prepare for the unexpected.   Is there a way to condition my clients to think the same wayp  pCan anyone offer advice on how I can continue to work on this web project without eating too much of the cost myselfp  pstrongAdditional infostrong  Ive only been freelancing full time for 1 year.  I dont yet have the high end clients, but Im slowly getting there.  Im getting better quality clients as time goes by.p

Negative 34113 pI have a ColdFusion application thats behind an ISA Server. Part of the application is protected by Basic Authentication and part is not. ISA Server sets a cookie when the user logs in, but the cookie is only available for reading when I bypass ISA. So, the cookie cannot be read from the server where the application is running. p  pIm trying to test whether the users ISA session has timed out or not. I cant make any HTTP calls on the application server without affecting the session expiration time.p  pI thought I could read the cookie from the backend server through a cross domain AJAX call. Unfortunately, on the backend server the cookie is only available in a directory that is protected by Basic Authentication. Because of the Basic Authentication requirement, I cant use JSONP to check for the existence of the cookie. I also cant use a proxy script on the application server because that will change the expiration time of the cookie, which is what Im trying to avoid. p  pI tried using an iFrame in my application to load a page on the backend server, but I cant get it working with Basic Authentication. I always get the login popup box.p  pAny ideas how I can test for the existence of the cookie on the backend server without triggering an update of the cookie expiration time on the application serverp

Negative 34113 pThis question pertains to web applications. I have very little web app development experience, so might be missing some very obvious pointsissues. Please point them out.p  pAs I understand, in most web applications, a web server sends HTML over the wire to a client browser. This happens every time a HTTP request is made. I feel this is very wasteful of bandwidth.p  p1 Since browsers can run JavaScript, why dont we just send a JavaScript program which can generate the webpages HTML content which the browser then renders.p  p2 Further a browser might cache the JavaScript program and next time the server only need send the data. The protocol might involve the browser sending the program version it has.p  pConsider an example of a relatively simple website Hacker News [a hrefhttpnews.ycombinator.com] relnofollowhttpnews.ycombinator.com]a. Let us separate the data 30 posts  their metadata from its presentation. Assuming 1 above, the server can just send the data say in JSON  a JavaScript program to generate HTML. This a hrefhttpsgist.github.com782329 relnofollowgista shows the idea. The data for the 30 posts is in JSON [a hrefhttpwww.json.orgjs.html] relnofollowhttpwww.json.orgjs.html]a format. For this particular example the data transferred is cut in 12 size of dataJavaScript  size of HTML. Further if browsers can do 2 above, it reduces the data transferred on each visit to 14 size of data  size of HTML. [Note this analysis is without considering compression gzip,deflate is very successful in reducing the size of HTML. But isnt prevention better than cure]p  pI see atleast the following advantages of this br  For most web pages, it will reduce the size of data transferred over the wire.br  Forces web apps to separate data from its presentation.p  pDisadvantages might include  more complex browsers, time to run the JavaScript program to generate HTML this might get offset by the reduction in data size.p  pNow my question is  why are web applications not developed this way, or, why do web applications send HTML over the wire Surely the web server sending out HTML doesnt care about HTML at all, so why should it, first, generate it, and then send it over the wirep

Negative 34113 pIm working on an ASP.NET project for the first time in about three years in the meantime Ive been working with PythonDjango, PHP and ObjC. Anyways, picked it right back up... except something that is totally killing me right now, and I have a feeling it must be staring me in the facep  pIm trying to bind to an LDAP server, for the purpose of authenticating users. The way it works here is, you bind on your own credentials, use that to find the Distinguished Name of the user youre authenticating, then you bind again on their DN and their password. If the bind is successful, the password was correct and the user can be authenticated.p  pHeres the problem  the first bind on the fixed credentials, the ones with the ability to search for users and their subtrees works fine. The search works fine. The second bind fails, no matter what, with the LDAP error INVALIDCREDENTIALS. This happens even when completely valid credentials are supplied.p  pHeres the code, with the usernames and passwords redacted, of course...p  precodepublic static bool Authenticatestring username, string password          bool valid  false        try                  LdapDirectoryIdentifier lid  new LdapDirectoryIdentifier[[REDACTED]]           System.Net.NetworkCredential cred  new System.Net.NetworkCredential[[REDACTED]], [[REDACTED]]            LdapConnection lconn  new LdapConnectionlid           lconn.Bindcred           SearchRequest request  new SearchRequest[[REDACTED]], cn  username, SearchScope.Subtree, new String[]  dn, sn            SearchResponse response  SearchResponselconn.SendRequestrequest            SearchResultEntry rslt  response.Entries[0]           string userdn  rslt.DistinguishedName           System.Net.NetworkCredential usercred  new System.Net.NetworkCredentialuserdn, password           were already in trycatch, so if this fails well be booted out           lconn.Bindusercred           otherwise were all good           valid  true              catch LdapException e                  if e.ErrorCode  0x31 INVALIDCREDENTIALS               throw e           otherwise fall through to DB authentication           DB Auth goes here        return valid       codepre  pIve stepped over this code, reading out the variables and doing the LDAP bind manually through pythonldap in the python console and the DNpassword combination works fine.

Now, all the result sent by mysql 10,000 rows to PHP are sent to a zipcode calculator library which calculates this distance between the base zip code and users zip code  10,000 times. Then orders the result by the zip code nearest.p  pAs you can see, this is very badly optimized code. And the 10,000 records are looped through twice. Not to mention the amount of RAM each httpd process takes just transferring data to and fro mysql.p  pWhat I would like to ask the gurus in here that is there anyway to optimize this  p  pstrongI have a few ideas of my own, but im not sure how efficient they are.strongp  pTry to do all the zipcode calculation and ordering in mysql itself and return the paginated number of rows.  For this, i will need to move the distance between zipcode calculation logic to a stored procedure. This way I am preventing the processing of 10,000 records in PHP. However, there is still a problem. I would not need to calculate distance for zip codes which have already been calculated for 2 users having the same zip code. p  pSecondly, how do i order rows in mysql using a stored procedure p  pWhat do you guys think  Is this a good way  Can i expect a performance boost using this  Do you have any other suggestions p  pI know this question is huge, and i really appreciate the time you have taken to read till the end.

The Loader processes a continuous stream of images from a server think MJPEG. I create a socket, add a ProgressEvent.SOCKETDATA listener, and put the data into a local buffer.

Do I need to doublebuffer the image If so, where do I do this The Loader doesnt seem like the right place.p

Negative 34113 pOne of the big uses of code generation in c is to support message serialisation.  Typically, you want to support specifying message contents and layout in the same step and produce code for that message type that can give you objects capable of being serialised tofrom communication streams.  In the past, this has usually resulted in code that looks likep  precodeclass MyMessage  public SerialisableObject     message members   int myNumber   stdstring myString   stdvectorltMyOtherSerialisableObjectgt aBunchOfThingsIWantToSerialise  public    ctor, dtor, accesors, mutators, then    virtual void SerialiseSerialisationStream amp stream        stream amp myNumber     stream amp myString     stream amp aBunchOfThingsIWantToSerialise     codepre  pThe problem with using this kind of design is that violates an important rule of good architecture you should not have to specify the intent of a design twice.  Duplication of intent, like duplicated code and other common development duplication, leaves room for one place in the code to become divergent with the other, causing errors.p  pIn the above, the duplication is the list of members.  Potential errors include adding a member to the class but forgetting to add it to the serialisation list, serialising a member twice possibly by not using the same order as the member declaration or possibly due to a misspelling of a similar member, among other ways, or serialising something that is not a member which might produce a compiler error, unless name lookup finds something at a different scope than the object that matches lookup rules.  That kind of mistake is the same reason we no longer try to match every heap allocation with a delete instead using smart pointers or ever file open with a close using RAII ctordtor mechanisms  we dont want to have to match up our intent in multiple places because there are times we  or another engineer less familiar with the intent  make mistakes.p  pGenerally, therefore, this has been one of the things that code generation could take care of.  You might create a file MyMessage.cg to specify both layout and members in one stepp  precodeserialisable MyMessage    int myNumber   stdstring myString   stdvectorltMyOtherSerialisableObjectgt aBunchOfThingsIWantToSerialise  codepre  pthat would be run through a code generation utility and produce the code.p  pI was wondering if it was possible yet to do this in c0x without external code generation.  Are there any new language mechanisms that make it possible to specify a class as serialisable once, and the names and layout of its members are used to layout the message during serialisationp  pTo be clear, I know that there are tricks with boost tuples and fusion that can come close to this kind of behavior even in the prec0x language.  Those usages, though, being based on indexing into the tuple rather than bymembername access, have all been brittle to changing the layout, as other places in the code that access the messages would then also need to be reordered.  Some kind of bymembername access is necessary to not have to duplicate the layout specification in places in the code that use the messages.p  pAlso, I know it might be nice to take this up to the next level and ask for specifying when some of the members emshouldntem be serialised.  Other languages that offer serialisation built in often offer some kind of attribute to do this, so     int myNonSerialisedNumber [[noserialise]] might seem natural.  However, I personally think it is bad design to have serialisable objects where everything is not serialised, since the lifetime of messages is in the transport tofrom the communications layer, separate from other data lifetimes.  Also, you could have an object which has a purely serialisable as on of its members, so such functionality doesnt by anything the language doesnt already offer.p  pIs this possible  Or did the standards committee leave out this kind of introspective capability  I dont need it to look like the code gen file above  any simple method for compiletime specification of layout and members in a single step would solve this common problem.p

Negative 34113 pIm writing a web service using NuSOAP in PHP. To test it, I have written both a server and a client.

Negative 34113 pI have made a Java game using LWJGL, which requires some native files. It all works fine in Eclipse. I want to include the .dll files inside a JAR file, but everytime I try, LWJGL cant find the natives. I have already tried using jarsplice or fatjar, but to no avail. I know minecraft is also programmed using LWJGL, and it somehow manages to load the natives from another folder.p  pIs there a way to package native files into a JAR file and let a 3rd party library, like LWJGL access them If not, how would I approach loading them from an external folderp  pEDIT Somehow it worked with the natives in the same directory as the JAR file. I would still like some explanation and perhaps some other methods, though.p

Negative 34113 pMy intention is to let send omit signal when the global counter is odd, and broadcast when even. Then there are 2 recv thread, waiting for signal. In case of signal, only one of the recv thread can receive it in case of broadcast, both may receive it.p  pBut my result shows me that both recv received the same odd number, which should not happen.p  pIs the global counter and the signal tightly coupled in my codep  pstrongeditstrong p  pI think I get answer to this question. After a recv thread receives signal, it will try to lock the mutex associated with the condition variable again, but it may need to wait because the mutex may have already been locked by other thread. During the waiting period, the global count may be changed, so the global count it finally prints is different from the one when it received signal.p  pAlso, in my code, even send send broadcast, multiples recv threads actually can not handle the signal concurrently, because they are still exclusive to each other because they share the same mutexp  pstrongend of editstrongp  precodeinclude ltpthread.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  pthreadmutext mutex  PTHREADMUTEXINITIALIZER pthreadcondt cond  PTHREADCONDINITIALIZER  int n  0 int count  0  void recvvoid name      while1              pthreadmutexlockampmutex           wait for signal         pthreadcondwaitampcond, ampmutex         count          ifcount gt 10                      printfnumber d terminate sn, n, charname                  else                      printfs gets numberdn, charname, n                  pthreadmutexunlockampmutex          ifcount gt 10                      return NULL                 void sendvoid ptr      while1              pthreadmutexlockampmutex         n           odd signal          even broadcast         ifn2             pthreadcondsignalampcond         else             pthreadcondbroadcastampcond         pthreadmutexunlockampmutex         int mainint argc, char argv[]          pthreadt t1, t2, t3      char name1  t1     char name2  t2      pthreadcreateampt1, NULL, recv, void  name1     pthreadcreateampt2, NULL, recv, void  name2     pthreadcreateampt3, NULL, send, NULL      pthreadjoint1, NULL         pthreadjoint2, NULL      pthreadcancelt3      return 0  codepre  pOutput, note the first 2 linesp  precodet2 gets number12493 t1 gets number12493 t1 gets number12534 t2 gets number12534 t1 gets number12623 t1 gets number12624 t2 gets number12666 t1 gets number12666 t2 gets number12713 t1 gets number12713 number 12770 terminate t2 number 12998 terminate t1 codepre

Negative 34113 pI am trying to create a cakePHP application that accesses the linkedin API. I found a plugin at the bakery that is exactly what Im looking for    a hrefhttpbakery.cakephp.orgarticlesinlet20110713linkedinplugin relnofollowhttpbakery.cakephp.orgarticlesinlet20110713linkedinpluginap  pUnfortunately, after installing the plugin it is not working.  Running the thisLinkedinconnect function results in being directed to a linkedin page that says We were unable to find the authorization tokenp  pI was able to connect using the SimpleLinkedIn Demo for PHP so I know Im not having an issue with my system time or API keys.p  pAfter many hours of debugging and learning about the OAuth process for Linkedin I believe I have narrowed down the problem to be when the plugin is getting the request token it doesnt receive anything from Linkedin so that it does not have a valid token when trying to authorize the user. I suspect the token request post is not structured correctly.p  pHas anyone had success with this plugin  Does anyone know of another Linkedin plugin for cakePHPp

Negative 34113 pIm working on a Rails 3.1 application where there are a number of different enumlike models that are stored in the database. There is a lot of identical code in these models, as well as in the associated controllers and views. Ive solved the code duplication for the controllers and views via a shared parent controller class and the new viewlayout inheritance thats part of Rails 3.p  pNow Im trying to solve the code duplication in the models, and Im stuck. An example of one of my enum models is as followsp  precodeclass Format lt ActiveRecordBase    hasandbelongstomany videos    attraccessible name    validates name, presence true, length  maximum 20     beforedestroy verifynolinkedvideos    def verifynolinkedvideos     unless self.videos.empty       self.errors[base] ltlt Couldnt delete format with associated videos.       raise ActiveRecordRecordInvalid.new self     end   end  end codepre  pI have four or five other classes with nearly identical code the association declaration being the only difference. Ive tried creating a module with the shared code that they all include which seems like the Ruby Way, but much of the duplicate code relies on ActiveRecord, so the methods Im trying to use in the module validate, attraccessible, etc. arent available. I know about ActiveModel, but that doesnt get me all the way there.p  pIve also tried creating a common, nonpersistent parent class that subclasses ActiveRecordBase, but all of the code Ive seen to accomplish this assumes that you wont have subclasses of your nonpersistent class that strongdostrong persist.p  pAny suggestions for how best to avoid duplicating these identical lines of code across many different enum modelsp

So I thought that putting all the timeseries in only one .txt file separated by some symbol like  for example could be more manageable. So I have a file like thisp  precode1 2 4 5 4  2 13 34  ... codepre  pIm wondering, is it possible to extract such series between two  in R and then apply the analysisp  pEDITp  pFollowing acesnap hints Im using this codep  precodelibraryKendall aread.tabletor.txt numData1017135  for i in 1numData  s1subseta,aV1i mMannKendalls1V2 catm[[1]],  ,m[[2]],   , m[[3]],  ,m[[4]],  , m[[5]], n ,   filemonotonictrendchecking.txt,appendTRUE  codepre  pThis approach works but the problem is that it is taking ages for computation.

Negative 34113 pI have a Javawritten server which uses a connection using JDBC with SQLite which is set in auto commit mode. However all the queries end up generating a journal file and when the server restarts, the database looks never changed. Is there some general reason why this may happen I know it would be helpful to provide some code, but Ive been working on it for hours and I cannot even reproduce it with smaller amount of code...p  pCan anyone give a general idea of why a journal file is still there even when autocommit is set to true Thanksp

Negative 34113 pIm using the Random class in my structs codeCompareTocode to pick, with equal probability, one of the structs when both have the same field values.

Negative 34113 pIm looking to distribute some information to different machines for efficient and extremely fast access without any network overhead. The data exists in a relational schema, and it is a requirement to join on relations between entities, but it is not a requirement to write to the database at all it will be generated offline.p  pI had alot of confidence that SQLite would deliver on performance, but RDMBS seems to be unsuitable at a fundamental level joins are very expensive due to cost of index lookups, and in my readonly context, are an unnecessary overhead, where entities could store direct references to each other in the form of file offsets. In this way, an index lookup is switched for a file seek.p  pWhat are my options here Database doesnt really seem to describe what Im looking for. Im aware of Neo4j, but I cant embed Java in my app.p  pTIAp  pEdit, to answer the commentsp  ul liThe data will be up to 1gb in size, and Im using PHP so keeping the data in memory is not really an option. I will rely on the OS buffer cache to avoid continually going to disk.li liExample would be a Product table with 15 fields of mix type, and a query to list products with a certain make, joining on a Category table.li liThe solution will have to be some kind of flat file. Im wondering if there already exists some software that meets my needs.li ul  pMark Wilkinsp  pThe performance problem is measured. Essentially, it is unacceptable in my situation to replace a 2ms IO bound query to Memcache with an 5ms CPU bound call to SQLite... For example, the categories table has 500 records, containing parent and child categories. The following query takes 8ms, with no disk IO SELECT 1 FROM categories a INNER JOIN categories B on b.id  a.parentid. Some simpler, joinless queries are very fast.p

Negative 34113 pThis is going to be one of those worstoftheworst situations where youre going to want to suggest something entirely different. Dont worry, I know, and unfortunately theres nothing I can do about it, so please try to limit your answers to ones that explain the smallest change possible that will make the biggest impact.p  pWith that said, heres my situation there is a process that replicates data from a Sybase server 15.5 to a SQL Server 2008 R2 every 30 minutes during business hours. On the SQL server, there is a linked server to the Sybase database from which we are copying tables. Heres the scary part the copying is done by DELETING all of the existing rows and INSERTING the new ones from Sybase, in this fashion within a stored procedure on the SQL server, triggered by enterprise scheduling softwarep  precode Table 1 DELETE FROM abc1 INSERT INTO abc1 col1, col2, col3     SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM LINKED.SERVER.dbo.abc1 GO   Table 2 DELETE FROM abc2 INSERT INTO abc2 col1, col2, col3     SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM LINKED.SERVER.dbo.abc2 GO   ... and so on for hundreds of tables codepre  pThere are no indices, primary keys, foreign keys, or data integrity whatsoever on the SQL server copy, but we emcanem control the table schemas we cannot, however, touch the Sybase server. The MSSQL database is basically a readonly environment for reporting and lookups. Performance isnt critical. Its been this way for years and so it lives on...p  pIf you havent vomited yet, you might have already thought of the problem strongevery once in a while, for a couple of seconds, our applications and reports cannot find and sometimes cannot access the data in the tables while they are being deleted from and inserted to.strongp  pIm no DBA, so things like table locks, hold locks, exclusive locks, etc. are foreign to me, but I gather that perhaps they could be of some help in this situation. After reading through MSDNs article on table hints, my brain is telling me that I should do something with transactions and table locks. I have no idea what, say, the following would do, because I am also unsure how to test itp  precodeSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE GO   Table 1 BEGIN TRANSACTION UpdateAbc1     DELETE FROM abc1 WITH TABLOCK, HOLDLOCK     INSERT INTO abc1 WITH TABLOCK, HOLDLOCK col1, col2, col3         SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM LINKED.SERVER.dbo.abc1 COMMIT TRANSACTION UpdateAbc1   Table 2 BEGIN TRANSACTION UpdateAbc2     DELETE FROM abc2 WITH TABLOCK, HOLDLOCK     INSERT INTO abc2 WITH TABLOCK, HOLDLOCK col1, col2, col3         SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM LINKED.SERVER.dbo.abc2 COMMIT TRANSACTION UpdateAbc2 codepre  pSo my questions arep  ul listrongWould modifying the stored procedure to incorporate transactions and locking allow requests to tables that are about to be modified to carry on without coming back empty andor causing deadlocksstrongli listrongIf not, and if you could change something on the SQL server, what would it bestrongli ul  pSybase and Microsoft SQL Server are at the point where normal database replication is possible, and it has been considered, but the task is too unwieldy for our group and our budget.p

Negative 34113 pThe Setup I currently have a page with a GridView control on it inside of an update panel, using a SqlDataSource. I have a timer setup to update the GridView every X amount of seconds. Typically for what I am testing every time the GridView updates about 45 new rows of data are added to the gridview, while the last 45 get tossed out. I am only displaying 15 results at a time and will have new results coming in every update.p  pThe Problem I allow the user to select the rows, while the GridView is being updated. I am handling this by setting the SelectedIndex property. However, when I select a row and then the grid is updated the row the user selected gets pushed down about 45 rows and the data in the previous selected index is selected instead. So where they clicked is selected at this point, not what they clicked.p  pI need a way to determine, if possible from the SqlDataSourceGridview, how many new rows have been added to the gridview. OR a way to maintain the selected data by the data in the row and not just the SelectedIndex.p  pAny help is appreciated, thanks.p  pRESOLVED Ok I went ahead and added a new invisible column to my grid, and am now keep track of the unique IDs selected from the DB. By setting an array before databinding, and comparing that to the new array I get after databinding I was able to use a simple Intersect to determine the number of rows that are the same. Then I used that to determine from the total how many are new this postback.p
Negative 34113 pFirst question on Stack Overflow, apologies if it is not well formed.p  pI am developing a relatively complex tabbed app, and already had the basics set up before coming across information that ActivityGroup and TabActivity are deprecated, and the preferred model is to use views. p  pI have had no trouble using views, this is a question about architecture rather than syntax which is why I havent posted any code. Specifically, emhow should I go about restructuring the app to use views instead of Intent launched Activitiesem.p  pThe app has five tabs two hold a single layout, no problem there.  The other three tabs are running an ActivityGroup with 25 different Activities i.e. a tab running an activity for settings, where clicking each view starts a new Activity dealing that particular setting, pressing the back button returns you to the broader settings activityview.  If I were to keep each Tab as a TabActivity, it would still be fairly easy to change those internal transitions to views as opposed to separate Activities.p  pThe main question is using ONLY views, no TabActivityActivity group at all. The vast majority of the research Ive done has been discussion about whether to use Activities or Views, or about specific syntax. I havent been able to gather a clear idea of how to actually MAKE the transition to views across the whole application.p  ol lipIf I were to do so, wouldnt the entire app now be running in a single Activity  the one hosting the tabbed layout  pli lipIf 1 is true, how to manage this  Despite ActivityGroup being deprecated, all of the Android documentation still seems to state that it is preferred to use separate Activities for separate aspects of functionalitywhich makes sense.  Did the Android development team simply decide that the costs to the stack and the device made the TabActivity implementation ineffectivepli lipIf the application is running in a single Activity that manages different views for each tab and then different views WITHIN a tab when necessary, should I have one single enormous onClick method to handle all clicks from any clickable view, handling input based on which view is active  Or should I register and deregister all of my Listeners programaticallypli lipWith a single Activity, wont any click listener or any broadcast receiver be running all of the time, consuming resources even when unnecessarypli lipWith a single Activity, the back button would exit the entire app from any point in its functionality.  If I am using views, wont I have to consistently override onBackPressed and carefully manage the app behavior to force it to behave like an Android apppli lipAM I THINKING ABOUT THIS COMPLETELY WRONG  Its possible that I am unintentionally attempting to recreate ActivityGroup and TabActivity functionality using views instead, when  I should be taking an entirely different design approach to using tabs and Views.pli ol  pWhen the people at Google say we shouldnt use activities as tabs anymore, and Mr. Mark Murphy so emphatically agrees, Im inclined to believe.  I simply havent been able to researchup a way to switch without resorting to recreating a lot of Activity functionality by hand which would probably include a variety of dirty hacks.p  pAppreciation in advance for anyone willing to tackle such a vague and overwritten topic.p

Usually, I want to have the front copper layer mirrored I have often experimented with loading the .ps output into, say, codeinkscapecode, and then trying to do a mirroring there. Using codeinkscapecode was also convenient, because one can easily add a logo there and then mirror the print and the logo together.p  pHowever, using codeinkscapecode to process postscript output is an expencive operation embecause it takes a while for codeinkscapecode to load, and do the mirroring, and the savingem...

Note that typically, the copper part is filled with black  and Id basically like to have a white logo on top of it.p  pNow, since this print is already mirrored  if I want to add a logo on top of it, I better have the logo mirrored as well.

Negative 34113 pI have a question that I dont particularly know how to phrase properly so apologies in advance for lack of proper terminology.  What Im attempting to do is have a header image aligned left  left0px  with positionabsolute so that when the page loads on different sized screens itll always be stuck to the left side of the browser window.  But at the same time I want the header image to stop when its loaded on a larger sized screen when its aligned left with the page if this makes sense.  The page is belowp  pa hrefhttptinyurl.comd2zttye relnofollowhttptinyurl.comd2zttyeap  pI want the BREAKWATER image to float with the page as it resizes but stop when it meets the background image below it the page div. So when loading in windows that are greater than the size of the background image 1592px it wont float farther left.  As of now it doesnt float with the page size and gets cut off on smaller screens.p  pHopefully this makes sense and let me know if I need to clarify anything.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciatedp  pThanks p

Negative 34113 pI have few a hrefhttpwww.ext.net relnofollowExt.NETa ComboBox controls on a Web Form. Selecting an item from the first fires the ValueChanged event to populate the second, and so on.p  pExcept emForce Selectionem property, I have not altered other properties of the ComboBox control.p  pI am experiencing odd behavior of Combo Box controls. As all controls get filled via AJAX request, I find it difficult to set focus on any control. As soon as I bring focus on any control, the cursor disappears after it gets filled.p  pSecondly, one of the ComboBox is not permitting me to select an item from the list. Even if I try to select an item, it automatically brings back the default item back, which is actually a sixth item in the list.p  pI double checked the queries and there is no way through which sixth item should get selected.p  pIf I try to open the DropDown list using mouse, it opens for few seconds and collapses automatically.p  pIs there any way to fix these strange issue Any other thirdparty opensource controlp
Negative 34113 pI have Ubuntu 11.10, and I have always run python just fine. However I have run into a problem.

Negative 34113 pIm working on a pretty complex web application in Ext with Google maps API v3.

Negative 34113 pI am building an Eclipse application with Maven Tycho. I managed to create the pom files for building the plugins and features. I ran install on them and got Build successful. I have also cretaed the pom for the application product and set the Packaging to eclipseapplication. The application is featurebased. I ran install and got the Build successful. I got the generated folder for the application, containing the folders plugins and features.p  pThe problem is that not all the jar files, for all the plugins, can be found in the plugins folder. I can find the jar files for the plugins that are listed in the features. But the jar files for the plugins listed in the Dependencies tab of other plugins are not generated. In other words, only the plugins referenced in the features are generated as jar files, while the jar files for the ones referenced in the plugins are not generated.p  pObviously, I cannot run the application without them. What am I doing wrong How can I get all the required jar files generatedp  pThank youp

The only way I can make the codeCALayercode to render the codeUIImagecode is by setting its contents to the codeUIImagecode after the codeUIViewControllercode is made visible, such as in the codeviewDidAppearcode method. p  pI would really prefer to do all my set up in the codeviewDidLoadcode method isnt that whats its for. How do I get the codeCALayercode to render its contentsp

Negative 34113 pIm writing a little utility in C to make sure a specified folder and all of its contents have appropriate access rights I want to give the codeAuthenticated Userscode group full access.

That only makes sense. So, what I want to do is turn security permission inheritance back on for any such subfolders.p  pMy digging has uncovered the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.security.accesscontrol.objectsecurity.setaccessruleprotection.aspxcodeObjectSecurity.SetAccessRuleProtectioncodea method which should be half of what I need. However, it seems sloppy to just blindly use the above method on objects that already inherit their parents DACL. Thus, I want to determine which objects have their permission inheritance turned off, but I cant seem to find the corresponding method or property which returns this information.

Negative 34113 pIve been recently playing with Groovy and have messed around with JRuby before and appreciate using the code.eachcode closure in their collections. p  pThat said, I cannot help but feel that this is nothing but syntactic sugar for a visitor pattern.

I noticed that the float3 datatype actually still has a fourth value s3 that does not get initialized.  I think that is where the non initialized zero value is coming from.

Negative 34113 pFirst, let me say I am a complete noob at this so I am really sorry if something does not sound right or if the answer is very basic. p  pMy issue is I am trying to add two columns to my SQL database and be able to revamp my codeselectcode statement in my ASP.NET script to return the new values into a codetextboxcode on the page.p  pSoftware   MS Visual Studio Ultimate 2010   SQL Server 2008 R2p  pBackground I have an existing page that references a table adapter that does a basic SELECT statement from my SQL database that ends up returning a single row every time because the where variable is pulled from a link in a gridview that used a similar table adapter.  I have gone into the SQL database, directly, and added my new columns and input data on my first line so that I could test them.  After doing that, I went to my datatable and table adapter in VS and added the new columns to the necessary adapters and verified that they were added to the corresponding tables.  Finally, on the page that I have added my text boxes, that I am trying to populate, and updated the VB behind code to check the column for DBNull.p  pResult When I run the script on my machine the text boxes are not populating.  I run the script in debugger and inserted a breakpoint on the line that first checks for the DBNull so that I could try and diagnose from there but when I hover over my database line to see what items are available my new columns are not showing up.  Even when I click to view the Dataset Visualizer, the table stops at the point that my new columns should be appearing.  I have executed query and previewed data within the datatable window and am able to return the appropriate data.  p  pI am sure there are more variables I am not thinking to added but basically my question is this, what could be causing my new columns to appear within my previewed data but not to appear within the VB script when it is running on the site.  As I said, I am a noob probably younger in the eyes of asp.net so if there are more details needed or if the answer is very basic, please be gentle. p  precodeProtected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As

Negative 34113 pTo implement real numbers between 0 and 1, one usually uses ANSI floats or doubles. But fixed precision numbers between 0 and 1 decimals modulo 1 can be efficiently implemented as 32 bit integers or 16 bit words, which add like normal integerswords, but which multiply the wrong way, meaning that when you multiply X times Y, you keep the high order bits of the product. This is equivalent to multiplying 0.X and 0.Y, where all the bits of X are behind the decimal point. Likewise, signed numbers between 1 and 1 are also implementable this way with one extra bit and a shift.p  pHow would one implement fixedprecision mod 1 or mod 2 in C especially using MMX or SSE  I think this representation could be useful for efficient representation of unitary matrices, for numerically intensive physics simulations. It makes for more MMXSSE to have integer quantities, but you need higher level access to PMULHW.p

Negative 34113 pIm tasked with building a large eCommerce site for a retailer. We are using packaged software for it. The package is difficult to tailor, and inflexible, but it scales on a solidly tested java application.p  pIn the background though, Ive been considering trying to use this as a reference workload to build a custom Ruby on Rails eCommerce application  just for interest sake and to learn the framework. But before I start too far down the path, I guess Im looking for a high level is determination if its even possible to reach this type of workload with ROR.p  pThe app would have to capture about 2000 orders per hour, but each order is big, so would be processing about 140,000 line items per hour. Concurrent customers are relatively straightforward, at about 5,000 active in an hour. But browse to shop is high, with a conversion of about 45 of customers coming to the site to shop so majority of processing is order capture rather than search amp browse of most sites.p  pSo my question is, what is large workload when it comes to ROR Is this a feasible NFR to meet with a ROR application What considerations should I makep

Negative 34113 pI would like to build a simple app monitor for my GAE app that sends me emails when Ive hit certain markers 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 and 100 of my billing ceiling. Thus, if my billing ceiling for a given day was, say, 50, I would get emails when I reached 40, 42.5, 45, 47.5, 49 and 50 respectively. The purpose of this monitor is obviously to alert me that I may need to increase my billing ceiling or prepare for some kind of failover event before my app gets shut down.p  pBefore I go heading down the track of writing my own monitor, I was wondering if GAE comes with this kind of functionality right out of the box. Nothing in their documentation seems too suggest that they do.p  pIf they dont provide such a service, does GAE expose some kind of secured API that I could hit e.g., codepublic double getPercentBillingCeilingcode, etc. If not, do any GAE gurus have any idea what I could use to automate the collection of this kind of information Thanks in advance.p

Negative 34113 pIve taken over the maintenance job of a device driver from another guy recently.p  pThe driver works with a pcie board. when the system starts up, the driver will allocate a 128Mb memory, and then set some registers on the board to pass the information about the allocated memory. Later when the board is working, it will write some data to the memory and some other application will access those data through the driver.p  pThe board is powered by a standalone adapter not powered by pcie slot, its a demo or development board. So when sometimes the fpga program in the board goes wrong, we will repowered on the board this is fast and restarted the pc also this is slow, otherwise the board will know nothing about the driverallocated memory.p  pHere comes my problem is it possbile for driver to know the board has been repowered on if it can detect the event and do something like those done when the system starts up, it will save us much time.p  pI havent got much knowledge about driver development before, it would be helpful if there is any nottoocomplicated tutorialarticle for this kind of job. Or maybe I must find some thick books to learn from scratchp  pHope Ive made myself understood and any suggestions would be greatly appreciatedp

The code I have works when player 2 guesses the correct checkboxes, however when the incorrect checkboxes are selected and the guess button is clicked nothing happens. I have a second if statement to check this but obviously something must be wrong.

Negative 34113 pIm in a real pickle and desperately need some help with a critical problem Im having.  p  pIve spent months writing a HTML5 appwebsite along with a native Android application that is simply a WebView wrapper for the HTML5 website.  One of the core features of the application is that users can share app specific URLs to Facebook and Twitter etc so that their friends can follow the shared URLs which will open up either the HTML5 version of my app in their browser OR MOST IMPORTANTLY if they are on Android and they have my native Android app installed they are PROMPTED TO OPEN IN MY APP.p  pThis is a rather long complicated issue so to simplify Ill use some certain terms consistently throughout this postp  ul liMyApp user a Android device user who DOES have my native Android app installedli linonMyApp user a Android device user who DOES NOT have my native Android app installedli listock browser user a stock Android user who uses a stock browser li linonstock browser user a Android user who uses a nonstock browser note the Samsung Galaxy SII stock Internet app is considered nonstockli lichoose app dialog on Android the OS dialog that appears asking the user what application they want to open the actionintenturldocument with and if they want to default to use this application alwaysli ul  hr  pMy AndroidManifest.xml contains the following...p  precodeltintentfiltergt   ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.VIEW gt   ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.DEFAULT gt   ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.BROWSABLE gt   ltdata androidschemehttp androidhostmyapp.com androidpathPrefix gt ltintentfiltergt codepre  pWhen tested this WORKS PERFECTLY in any normal scenario.

Great, Ive definitely configured my AndroidManifest.xml correctly.p  pHowever things do NOT ALWAYS WORK in the critical Facebook sharing scenerio.  It does not always work because both Facebooks native Android app and Facebooks mobile website httpm.facebook.com DO NOT LINK DIRECTLY to the shared URLs but instead link via a Facebook redirect page.

Negative 34113 pIm currently using the GroundOverlay function within a KML file to display an circular image.  I know the circle is 48 degrees in diameter, and I want it to look like a circle when I overlay it on the earth.  Rather than being a perfect circle though, its distorted, most visibly at the poles.  I think the reason for the distortion is that GoogleEarth assumes my original image used a map projection, so GE unprojects my image, creating the distortion.  Is there a way to overlay my circular image as a circle through KML or the maps API by turning off the projection  Or is my only option to project my circular image into a simple cylindrical projection before I call GroundOverlay on it  Id really prefer the first option if it exists.p

The solution is to change codereadStringcode to specify that it must use UTF16 encodingp  precodeprotected static String readStringDataInputStream din         throws IOException     int strLength  2din.readInt     byte[] stringHolder  new byte[strLength]     din.readstringHolder     return new StringstringHolder, UTF16  codepre  pMy question is, why is this necessary Since Java uses UTF16 for strings by default, why wouldnt it assume that UTF16 is being used when reading chars from bytes Or, alternatively, why wouldnt it just encode the chars as bytes in the first place by default In short, why dont the default behaviors of the codewriteCharscode method and the codeStringbyte[]code constructor parallel each otherp

However, their site design isnt great and wed like to just pull in the product data into our own existing site.p  pCurrently our site pages for each product category just uses an iframe with the src URL pointing to the link generated by the results of a hrefhttpwww.promoplace.comwsws.dllStartSrchDistID36182 relnofollowthe search forma on the Sage site they provide us. Obviously this isnt great since its slow to pull the data in, and my iframe has to be sized to always fit the max height since i dont want scroll bars for the iframe.p  pAgain, I am self taught with web development with my only tools being a healthy amount of google... and just reading source code, so if you have any recommendations, please be specific and detailed. p  pI have found something on this site posted by someone else that actually ALMOST works for me using the following code I am testing at a hrefhttppromocentral.compens2 relnofollowthis URLa if you want to see whats happening. p  pIts using the following codep  precodeltphp ch  curlinit curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, httpwww.promoplace.comwsws.dllStartSrchDistID36182ampProdSelectampSrching1ampCatNamePensampcatmovetoPensampcategory221ampkeywordsampitemnumampLoPampHiPampQtyampSearch.x44ampSearch.y22ampSearchsubmitampGlobalSearch curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHEADER, 0 curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, TRUE gt ltphp result  curlexecch curlclosech gt ltphp result  pregreplaceltsas[gt]hrefss[]http[gt][gt],1httpwww.promoplace.com23, result echo result gt codepre  pIf you look at my test page... the data is coming over well enough, but the external images dont display, and when you click through to view more details it appends the correct actual link data that should come after the external domain to MY domain, which points to a directory that exists externally, and not on my domain.

Negative 34113 pIm trying to add a section to a corporate wiki which will serve as a sort of frontend to a Documentumbased data warehouse since theres no search function and poor internal organization. The idea is to create an article stub for each document with metadata and a direct link, and use Semantic Mediawiki to track and organize the articles in the system.p  pIm using Semantic Forms to manage the article creation after an initial push from a few spreadsheets using the API, but Id like to automate the article naming as well so the system holds users hand from beginning to end. All of the titles will be things like MBMA00001, so Id like a button on the MBMA page that, when pressed, searches CategoryMBMA, determines the highest number MBMAn currently in the system, and takes the user to a Semantic Form template with MBMAn1 already input as the title.p  pExtensions such as a hrefhttpwww.mediawiki.orgwikiExtension3aInputbox relnofollowInputBoxa, a hrefhttpwww.mediawiki.orgwikiExtension3aCreateBox relnofollowCreateBoxa, and a hrefhttpwww.mediawiki.orgwikiExtension3aCreateArticle relnofollowCreateArticlea dont seem to support this function, but is there another extension that I can add that will do so Or will I have to figure out how to write my ownp

Negative 34113 p[EDIT]p  pAfter a lot of trial and error, I realized a version of my tooltip code could scroll while the rest of the codes are unchanged.  The only difference between the two tooltip usage is that the pos.x value is shifted, instead of being exactly where the mouse is.p  pWhich means instead of p  precodeXaxis Tooltip tooltip.ShowMath.TruncatexValue  1000  1000  unitConverter, this.chart1, pos.X, pos.Y  15 codepre  pI did this p  precodeXaxis Tooltip tooltip.ShowMath.TruncatexValue  1000  1000  unitConverter, this.chart1, pos.X  70, pos.Y  15 codepre  pThat was all the difference. Now I can click and drag the Xaxis scroll bar around.  I suppose the reason why I always could scroll my Yaxis is it was shifted by 15 to begin with. p  pSo if you set your tooltip position exactly where your mouse position is, then apparently you will be clicking on the tooltip itself, instead of the scrollbar when you attempt to scroll.p  pAnswer provided by Josh W is equally valid, because using just this instead of this.chart automatically shifts the tooltip a little bit for some reason.  thanks for the helpp  hr  p[Original Question]p  pI have a chart that has Yaxis and Xaxis scroll bar.  For a while both my scrollbars worked.  As my code grow, the Xaxis scrollbar now wont move, while the Yaxis scrollbar moves just fine.  I am puzzled.

Negative 34113 pI want to know if there is a good way to convert system generated errors into something more meaningful for the user. for example if for some reason the application could not connect to the SMTP server. I want to convert the message thrown by the system which will be something like SMTP connection failure to We could not send you an email. This friendly message I want to pull out from a resource file. While this is an example of one such exception, there could be more. p  pWe dont have try catch blocks across all the layers. It is present only in the UI layer. We have a exception management class that takes in all exceptions and returns a friendly string from it. Every catch block in the UI layer makes a call to this exception management class and passes it an exception of type System.Exception whose method needs to return the said friendly error string for use on the UI. p  pThe only way I can think of doing this now is having one large IF ELSE block in the exception management class that checks the exception string received and pulls out a matching friendly message from the resource file. p  pIs there a better way to go about thisp

Negative 34113 pI have a Windows Forms Application and it is written in C.  I am also using a sql server with a datagridview.  I have an Add form in my program that allows a user to enter in data to a multiple of text boxes that uploads to my server.  I have this part completed and it works just great.p  pI have a textbox called resumelinkTextBox. I also have a browse button that will open an open file dialog.  I want to be able to select a file from the open file dialog browser, which in turn will enter the path into the resumelinkTextBox.  When I hit Add resume, I want it to upload the file to a specified folder on my network.  Also, I need it to update the resumelink column in my sql server, but with ONLY the name of the file.  So if my file is located at CUsersnewresume.doc I need that to upload to CUsersNewResumes and then have just the filename newresume.doc in the resumelink column of my sql server.p  pAny examples or links to examples would be greatly appreciated.p  pBelow here is my insert command that uploads information from the textboxes to my sql server.p  precodeinsertCommand.CommandText  SET IDENTITYINSERT HRResume ON INSERT INTO HRresume name, skillset, recordkey, date, comment, referral, resumelink VALUES name, skillset, recordkey, date, comment, referral, resumelink SET IDENTITYINSERT HRResume OFF insertCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuename, nameTextBox.Text insertCommand.Parameters.AddWithValueskillset, skillsetTextBox.Text insertCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuerecordkey, recordkeyTextBox.Text insertCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuedate, dateTextBox.Text insertCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuecomment, commentTextBox.Text insertCommand.Parameters.AddWithValuereferral, referralTextBox.Text insertCommand.Parameters.AddWithValueresumelink, resumelinkTextBox.Text insertCommand.Connection.Open insertCommand.ExecuteNonQuery MessageBox.ShowResume Added. connection.Close codepre

Negative 34113 pIm new to MongoDB.  Heres my problem a user can have multiple avatars, but one and only one is active.  Heres what a user document looks like for the momentp  precode   id ObjectId515c99f7e4d8094a87e13757,   avatars [     url httpexample.comimgphoto1.jpg,     width 50,     height 50,   ,      active true,     url httpexample.comimgphoto2.jpg,     width 50,     height 50,   ]  codepre  pThis solution is simple enough, but there are a few things I dont likep  ol lichanging the active avatar means updating two embedded documentsli liIm not sure it will behave nicely in case of concurrent access readavatarchangeactiveavatar or changeactivechangeactive will itli lilooking for the active avatar requires a sequential searchli ol  pAnother solution would be thisp  precode   id ObjectId515c99f7e4d8094a87e13757,   activeavatarid 2,   avatars [     id 1,     url httpexample.comimgphoto1.jpg,     width 50,     height 50,   ,      id 2,     url httpexample.comimgphoto2.jpg,     width 50,     height 50,   ]  codepre  pThis fixes problems 1amp2, but not problem 3.  And it adds an extra codeidcode field in every embedded document.  Plus when I insert a new avatar I now need to know whats the next codeidcode to use unless I use an objectId, but then its a 12 bytes id for just a few hundred avatars max.p  pSo yet another solution could be thisp  precode   id ObjectId515c99f7e4d8094a87e13757,   activeavatar      url httpexample.comimgphoto2.jpg,     width 50,     height 50,   ,   extraavatars [     url httpexample.comimgphoto1.jpg,     width 50,     height 50,   ]  codepre  pNot much better than the first solution it just fixes problem 3, thats it, and its uglier.p  pAll these solutions work, but Im looking for the right way to do it.  Any ideas  And what if I allow users to have multiple active avatars whatever that would meanp  pThanks.p
Negative 34113 pI a problem in my report.

Negative 34113 pI am working on learning databases and am unsure about something that doesnt seem to make any sense to me. In the relational model you are able to combine through references but always require a global sort of key in each table to be able to combine this information. That is obviously required in most cases, but I feel like in a perfect tree hierarchy set up of a database this is inefficient.p  pTo explain this better I shall use the example of storing products in a database. Products have main categories and sub categories and these are very clear. ie. Milk is a subcategory of Dairy which is a subcategory of Food, etc.p  pI thought in cases like this the ability to store single or a list of referencespointers to tables in fields would take away a lot of search querying and storage requirements.p  pHere is a link to a simple pain layout I made to illustrate this a hrefhttppostimg.orgimagev1cxd96b5 relnofollowImagea the table entry could have some command character like  after which it knows the following entry is a file directory so when the database initiates it knows to make a pointer therep  pSince I am only learning to work with databases now I understand that I may just be missing some knowledge on the subject, but I dont seem to find anything when I try googling this problem. Any help explaining where to start or any confirmation that this may improve efficiency and where I could learn how to write this myself would be great.p
Negative 34113 pI have 2 views named AA and AB and in a near future Ill have more AC, AD, etc.... Right now in my viewControllers, I need to import all my UIView subclass and test something in order to know which subview I need to create and add to the view hierarchy.p  pMy idea was to create a view named A which will figure out which subviews it needs to draw and change its class to a private one which could be AA or AB. But I dont know how to do it. p  pOf course, I could test what needs to be tested and then add the new view as a subview but the idea was to have only one view and not a view within a view.p  pThanks for your answersp

Negative 34113 pI couldnt find documentation to help me with this problem  [EDIT ...and the only recommendations Ive gotten from colleagues is what I have mentioned below].p  pIm developing 23 figures that must include a PNG image of a state, and two charts with accompanying state data. Each chart has a slightly different scale, though the units will be the same I say this because it makes formatting a headache.

This is time consuming and aggravating, and Im optimistic theres a better way.p  h3Question What programmethods do you recommend for creating a standard figure formath3  pIdeally I would like to copyandpaste charts from Excel, and insert a PNG image. p

Negative 34113 pIm running a progress bar which updates every second. It needs to run for upwards of 300 seconds so the changes in the progress bars progress variable are on the magnitude of about 0.003 per second.p  pIve noticed a problem with low values of the progress variable, though. Basically, there does not seem to be any difference between 0.09 and anything lower than that. So what ends up happening is when the progress bar is in the 0.0  0.09 range it doesnt show any visual changes even though the progress variable is changing. Another side effect is if I start the progress bar from 0.0 it immediately jumps to the image for 0.09 or so and remains there until the real progress has passed that, which looks a little odd.p  pIts probably worth mentioning that this doesnt seem to be an issue anywhere else along the progress bar. Its able to move the bar 0.003 progress at a time everywhere else, including very near to 1.0.p  pI suppose its not a huge deal, but I was wondering if anyone knew a way around this.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 34113 pProfessionals out there,p  pthis is the first time that Im actually posting a question to this board that helped me out a lot in the past. Im still a programming novice and have been trying to learn a lot about programming amp software development in the last few months. p  pI recently tackled the topic c11Smart Pointers and decided rewrite all the Design Patterns I learned a few weeks earlier, including theObserver Pattern using sharedptr amp weakptr for resource management.p  pWhen I was trying to write a simple Implementation of the observer pattern like in Head Firsts Design Pattern or Design Patterns by E.Gamma, using an interfaceclass for both the observable subjects and the observers, and exactly one concrete class for each, I received various error messages from Visual Studio. I just dont understand how to combine sharedptr and weakptr in this pattern, which might be due to the fact that I still dont fully understand the the combination of both.p  pUnfortunatelly, even a thorough search on the Internet didnt provide me with a simple example of an observerpattern using smartpointer that can serve as a orientation for me.p  pI therefore was wondering, if one of you guys would know where to find such a simple implmentation or be so kind to provide me with one of your own. Both would be really really helpful p  pThanks a lotp  pcoderAndip

In addition, this duration is commonly longer than the actual event time since streaming may begin before the events start time.p blockquote  pThis doesnt seem to be always accurate  if a live event has a set broadcast duration, this seems to instead return the total time that the broadcast is scheduled for.  here is a random video that exhibits that behaviour a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchveBb5F8Jcwg relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchveBb5F8Jcwga found via a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comliveall relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comliveallap  pIve also tried using the data api and grabbing the publish time from the snippet, but this usually appears to be a few hours or days before the broadcast actually begins.  p  pAs a noncontent owner, is there any way to retrieve this timep  pThanksp  pEDITbr After looking further, I found developers.google.comyoutube2.0 which appears to offer this information under the ytwhen for each event... so I guess my revised question would be  is there a way to retrieve this given a video ID, or do I always need to find it through the live events apip

Negative 34113 pIm running into this error on a new Rails app and it has me a bit confused.  I can start the rails server and load the index page just fine, but when I try to load any other page I getp  pArguemntError A secret is required to generate an integrity hash for cookie session data. Use config.secrettoken  some secret phrase of at least 30 charactersin configinitializerssecrettoken.rbp  pNow what makes this strange is that I have verified that I do indeed have a .secret file.  I modified the secrettoken.rb file to generate a random .secret file as per the Mike Hartl tutorial.  I have checked that the .secret file does indeed exist.  In fact, I deleted it and restarted the server just to make sure it would generate a new one, and it did.  The contents of the .secret file do indeed contain a string of greater than 30 characters. And yet I am getting this error.  Im not sure what Im missing here.p  pI did some googling and it appears that some felt this error was related to a race condition caused by accessing the site too soon after starting the server.  I restarted the server, waiting five minutes, and then accessed the site.  Same issue.  I am at a loss to understand why I am getting this error.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 34113 pAs far as my current understanding of the static keyword goes, it prevents a variable from being reinitialized AND it prevents the variable from leaving the memory when a function ends.p  pIn C, I usually use this when a variable doesnt need to be global, but also shouldnt change in between function calls. f.i. microcontroller interruptsp  pNow, in some C code for an STM32, I saw the followingp  precodeint mainvoid    static char buffer[CONSOLEBUFFERSIZE]   ... codepre  pTo me, this doesnt make sense. This variable is used to buffer incoming commands in order to process them when the termination character is received. But the two properties of static I described earlier do not apply to the main function because main is called only once and never ends. So my actual questionp  pCould this be using some hocuspocus that I dont know about or would it simply be copied code from an interrupt or other function and did the programmers forget or not bother to remove the static keywordp

Negative 34113 pIm working with a MVC4 Project Code first. This solution contains two projects, and projects share a unique database. I have done a class library with clases POCO and the two projects reads of  these class libraries. There are one dbcontext in each Project, but not all clases are included in the two Project. For example, there are clases of simplemembership and one of projects is running with active directory permissions and there are some clases that only are used in one project. I want to do Code first migrations, but I dont know how Can I do it, because allways detects pending changes and one Project apply changes on database that are not compatible with the other project.. Is it a solution to copy the same content of DBContext for two projects and initialize allways all the library classes or exists a better solution Thanks.p

Negative 34113 pI have several processes which currently run as rake tasks.

Then I have to restart the rake task.p  pI am trying a couple of options, with help from the SO community. One is to figure out how to monitor the rake tasks with codemonitcode. But that means each process will have to have its own environment, adding to server load. Since Im running in a virtualized environment, I want to eliminate that wherever possible.p  pThe other option is just to leverage the Sidekiq option I already have. I use Sidekiq now for background processing, but its always just oneoffs. Is there some way I can have a continuous process in Sidekiq And also be notified of failures and have the processes restart automaticallyp

Negative 34113 pI setup a Sortable nested form in a Rails 4 application by modifying a bit the Railscast 147 tutorial and it all works fine. In my project, each codelicode wraps a codefieldsforcode with the fields for a nested resource, including a checkbox. My problem is that I want to process the checkbox information depending on the position of the checkboxcontaining codelicode. Plus, if one of the inputs gets checked, this should also affect other fields. I wrote a jquery function for doing this mostly through codeaddClasscode and coderemoveClasscode and I put calls to this function in my sortable and in an event handler.  p  precode  processcomponents  o gt     components  o.findli      other stuff     components.removeClassparentcomponent childcomponent     components.findinput.ischild.each gt       firstcheck  this.propchecked       secondcheck  this.closestli.next.findinput.ischild.propchecked       if firstcheck is true         this.closestli.addClasschildcomponent       if firstcheck is false and secondcheck is true         this.closestli.addClassparentcomponent  componentslist.sortable     axis y     items gt li.component     update gt       .postthis.dataupdateurl, this.sortableserialize       processcomponents this  componentslist.on click, checkbox, event gt     processcomponents componentslist codepre  pMy problem is that this works properly only after manually sorting the elements of the list a few times the elements become responsive to the checkbox state only after their position in the list has changed. I looked around here and on Google but I couldnt find any clue on why this happens. Could it possibly have something to do with the differences between Jquery and Jquery UI in handling codeaddClasscode Any ideas on how to fix this Thanks p

Negative 34113 pUPDATE 2 I never found the solution to this. Since the instructors code is readily available for us to use and hack together with our own, and Id already wasted weeks trying to debug, I just created a new table and started from his code, made changes and tested as I went, until I ended up with that I wanted in functionality. If anyone every comes across a reason for the odd behavior, Id sincerely appreciate knowing what caused this.p  pAlmost everyone who suggested anything offered up ideas I had already tried, and listed as already tried, in my original post. Thank you to everyone offering their insight, but please do read posts completely before making suggestions.p  pUPDATE to present my main question more clearly. The original post is below that with all code, as well as what Ive tried.p  pI designed my updateData function to update a record. Instead, it returns its error code.p  precodesub updateData       and this returns Update Failed for me. I cant figure out why.      sql  UPDATE friendface SET firstname  firstname,         lastname  lastname,         emailaddress  emailaddress,         password  password         WHERE userid  userid      rc  dbhgtdosql     if rc  1          print Update Failed       codepre  hr  pNinja editing as I reread through this mess 3p  pCode at the bottom. Sorry if the formatting is awful or Im not descriptive enough. I really tried. Ask if I can provide anything else that is helpful.p  pHi everyone,p  pSchool assignment here, print a table with records you can edit and delete.p  pIve got an HTML page with forms for inserting data, then a perl script that displays the table with buttons to update and delete. Delete works fine. The whole script works fine EXCEPT the link from the block of text you get when you access the .pl directly, but I dont care about that at the moment without the contents of my UPDATE function. The code for the UPDATE function works fine line by line in MySQL. But I cant get the codeupdateDatacode function with the UPDATE query to work in my .pl file.p  pWere allowed full access to the instructors example code. I COULD start with his page, then modify it into my own page. Id rather be able to write my own page without relying on that crutch. I am, however, comparing my code to his and I dont see where Im going wrong. Syntax looks good, as far as I know  can find docs for. p  ul lipI played with varying syntax anyway just in case. Put a comma after the final record before my WHERE clause because it looked wrong without, but apparently without is the way to go. Everything I read says the current syntax is correct.pli lipI thought maybe it was trying to edit a codeuseridcode that didnt exist, but printing the codeuseridcode showed it was using the correct one.pli lipI think my codeDBIgtconnectcode is working because it doesnt return Connection Failed.pli lipThe correct function, codeupdateDatacode, is running because the final output is the Update Failed return code, unique to that function.pli lipI can trace the code through Edit button  Edit form  Confirm Edit function  updateData function  dbh authenticates successfully, codedosqlcode, which is my UPDATE query, which looks syntactically correct. But for some reason, codedbhgtdosqlcode doesnt come out true.pli lipIn the codeupdateDatacode function, I thought Id make sure the problem wasnt that I was only updating 4 of the 6 fields. Well, 5, since the key isnt ever going to be updated. Anyway, I thought that might be tripping it up somehow, but adding a line to update username didnt help, so I took it out again.pli ul  pIve really been trying to figure this out on my own and Im pulling my hair out. Its always some dumb little thing. Is it spacing It usually doesnt matter, but I know codeENDFORMcode had to be the first, and only, thing on the line in order to work for me. But I dont know of any spacing rules for this particular code. Please.

Negative 34113 pI would like to know if it would be somehow possible to handle a Serial.println on an Arduino uno without holding up the main program. p  pBasically, Im using the arduino to charge a 400V capacitor and the main program is opening and closing the gate on a MOSFET transistor for 15 and 20 microseconds respectively. I also have a voltage divider connected to the capacitor which I use to measure the voltage on the capacitor when its being charged with the Arduino. I use analogRead to get the raw value on the pin, multiply the value by the required ratio and try to print that value to the serial console at the end of each cycle. The problem is, though, that in order for the capacitor to charge quickly, the delays need to be very small in the range of microseconds and the serial print command takes much longer than that to execute and therefore holds up the entire program. p  pMy question therefore is wherther it would somehow be possible to get the command to execute on something like a different thread without holding up the main cycle. Is the 8bit AVR capable of doing something like thisp  pThanksp

Negative 34113 pHi I have written some code for calling a stored procedure in a MySQL database using a MariaDB client, however the stmtbind parameter is not being populated with the necessary MYSQLBIND array for receiving the necessary data.p  pAm I doing something wrong or is there a bug with the driver  Mallocing the data does not break the implementation, but MySQL has its own more efficient means of managing memory for these arrays than malloc.p  pIf you are asking, I am using and abusing a switch statement, as I would like this function to be made eventually asynchronous in a cooroutine functor class working against a pool of connections, where a state value is used to control where we are in the switch statement.p  precodethe function that does all the heavy lifting for

Negative 34113 pIve got a very basic scene rendering with a vertex and color array some code below.  I see how to bind the vertexes and colors to the vertex shaders attributes.  Currently this vertex and color information is in a local array variable in my render function as you can see below and then codeglDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, ncode is called to draw them for each frame.p  pIm trying to picture the architecture of a larger moving scene where there are lots of models with lots of verticies that need to be loaded and unloaded.p  pThe nave way I imagine to extend this would be to place all the vertexcolor data in one big array in main memory and then call glDrawArrays once for each frame.  This seems to be inefficient to me.  On every frame the vertex and color information changes only in parts, so arranging and reloading an entire monolithic vertex array for every frame seems wrong.p  pWhat do 3D games and so forth do about this  Are they for each frame placing all the vertexes in one big array in main memory, and then calling glDrawArrays once  If not, what architecture and OpenGL calls do they generally use to communicate all the vertexes of the scene to the GPU  Is it possible to load vertexes into GPU memory and then reuse them for several frames  Is it possible to draw multiple vertex arrays from multiple places in main memoryp  precodestatic const char vertexShaderSource  R      attribute highp vec4 posAttr     attribute lowp vec4 colAttr     varying lowp vec4 col     uniform highp mat4 matrix      void main             col  colAttr        glPosition  matrix  posAttr         static const char fragmentShaderSource  R      varying lowp vec4 col      void main             glFragColor  col         void Windowrender      glViewport0, 0, width, height      glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT      mprogramgtbind      constexpr float delta  0.001     if forward         eyepos  QVector3D0,0,delta     if backward         eyepos  QVector3D0,0,delta     if left         eyepos  QVector3Ddelta,0,0     if right         eyepos  QVector3Ddelta,0,0      QMatrix4x4 matrix     matrix.perspective60, 4.03.0, 0.1, 10000.0     matrix.lookAteyepos, eyeposdirection, 0, 1, 0     matrix.rotatetimer.elapsed  100.0f, 0, 1, 0      mprogramgtsetUniformValuematrix, matrix      QVector3D vertices[]               0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,         1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,         1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,           QVector3D colors[]               1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,         1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,         1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f,           mprogramgtsetAttributeArrayposAttr, vertices     mprogramgtsetAttributeArraycolAttr, colors      mprogramgtenableAttributeArrayposAttr     mprogramgtenableAttributeArraycolAttr      glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, 3      mprogramgtdisableAttributeArrayposAttr     mprogramgtdisableAttributeArraycolAttr      mprogramgtrelease      mframe  codepre

Negative 34113 pAlright everyone, this ones scaring me My JVM is segfaulting at fairly random points in our application.p  pIt started 6 months ago, and I asked the oracle discussion group for helpp  blockquote   pa hrefhttpscommunity.oracle.comthread2578216 relnofollowhttpscommunity.oracle.comthread2578216ap blockquote  pno response.p  pThe problem went into hiding when we did some tuneups on our memory profile, and we started doing some really dumb things around serialization. p  pAfter implementing MapDB a persisted map, its not much of a database and replacing our cloningviaserialization strategy with the rits.cloning library this bug has reappeared. p  pThe difference is that now it seems to happen randomly.p  pI also cant get the JVM errors to show up reliably on standarderror anymore.p  pOne person reported seeing this error when his server shutdown and did some copying around of JAR files. We are not doing anything rubylike in our class file management. There is one class that reflects on some annotations at runtime, but the bug existed before this class was written. p  pAt this point my only solution is to try and deploy in such a way that there simply arent any jar files in our project, which would mean copying every library out of its jar container and putting it in our executable directory. Im not an operations guy, so I have no idea how to go about doing something like this or if it would help.p  pThoughts and suggestions would be hugely appreciated. This one is really beginning to worry me. So much so that Im beginning to wonder if we need to move ourselves to the .net framework not that .net is immune to this sort of nonsense, its just I feel more comfortable with the GAC than I do with JVMs class loading scheme. p  pThanks,p  pGeoffp

Negative 34113 pI am working on a Iphone game that uses OpenGL ES 1.1 for rendering and we having some issues getting alpha sorting to work correctly on an big mesh. The mesh in questions is of a stadium and the alpha parts are the crowd in the stadium. The problem is that when using Alpha Blending on the crowd we get some sorting issues that result in the user not being able to differentiate the front of the crowd from the back of the crowd. In most cases the crowd just shows up as a jumbled mess and no one can really tell who should be where. p  pNormally to fix an issue like this I would simply separate the stadium and the crowd from one another and then separate each crowd sectionEach Crowd is on its own plane so that we could better sort them. But we need to keep the draw count to under 100 objects so this is not something that we can do. p  pAnother idea that I had was to try and do some kind of crazy sorting by taking all the vertices and then trying to sort them via clockwise rotation. IE, take vers 0 to 10 and draw them first and then take verts 11 to 20 and then draw then next and so on and so forth until the whole crowd is drawn but I have no idea how to even begin doing this or of this is even possible to do. p  pIf that is not possible I was thinking that I could have an artist cut up the crowd meshes so that it fits the profile of the people that are displayed on it better so that we are displaying less alpha thus leaving us with less overdraw and possibly better sorting. But I am not sure if adding more vertes will cause any performance issues as I do not have a lot of experience with the Iphone. p  pIf any one has any ideas or links to any article that might help me better understand this issue that would be very helpful and I would like to thank you now for any help that you might provide. p

Negative 34113 pIve found several questions explaining virtualoverridenew keywords for overriding and hiding methods, but they dont seem to address the situation I have.

As far as I can tell, this works fine, but I dont understand when  if I should be using virtual  override. Should the protected base method be virtual Would it change anything if it were Im not getting the compiler warning about hiding inherited member that Ive seen at other times when I dont use override. Im guessing that virtual  override dont come into play because validate is a private method. I know I could also rename the BaseController.validate to something else, such as BaseValidate, and not have to think about overriding at all. Would that matter at all, or is it the same thing whether the method is called Validate or a different namep

Negative 34113 pI have been tasked with creating a macro in Excel 2003 that will take an imported data dump and format it into a report for my supervisor.  I have very little VBA experience so most of what I have done has involved recording a macro and then customizing the code where needed.  However I have it a spot that requires pure code and I am struggling.  Here is the situationp  pI have a SORTED column D that lists types of incidences for example vehicle fires, strokes, animal bites, etc.  I would like to write code that reads each value in column D and if it is NOT one of several values we are looking for, delete the entire row.p  pI have tried multiple versions of code that I have found online and the code that produces the results closest to what I need looks like thisp  precodeRangeDD.Select Dim workrange As Range Dim cell As Range Set workrange  IntersectSelection, ActiveSheet.UsedRange For Each cell In workrange     If ActiveCell.Value ltgt VFIRE          And ActiveCell.Value ltgt ILBURN          And ActiveCell.Value ltgt SMOKEA          And ActiveCell.Value ltgt ST3          And ActiveCell.Value ltgt TA1PED          And ActiveCell.Value ltgt UN1              Then ActiveCell.EntireRow.Delete Next cell codepre  pEnd Subp  pThe results of running this code delete a majority of the list 100 rows of the original 168, but it is only deleting the rows until it hits the first value of something I want.  For example, this current data dump does not have any values for ILBURN or SMOKEA, but when the first occurence of ST3 occurs the macro seems to stop.  There is no error generated, it just seems to think it is done. p  pI think I understand the logic behind the code, but I cannot understand what I should add to invoke the macro through the entire list.  Any insighthelp would be greatly appreciated.  p

Negative 34113 pI have the codeDatecode portion of DateTime as lookup value and like to retrieve the matching value in a Dictionary of type codeDictionaryltDateTime, doublegtcode. Note the DateTime keys are stored as only the Date portion.p  pMy problem is that there may be no key that matches with my lookup value. What I then like to do is to find the nearest strongpreviousstrong dateTime.Date key and matching value. p  pNow, I am aware that Dictionaries are not sorted by key. I could use a SortedDictionary but prefer to use a Dictionary for a specific reason or else switch to a List collection can be presorted. My question is, what would you recommend to do in this case Would it be more efficient to retain the Dictionary structure and decrement my lookup value until I find a matching key Or would it be better to use a list collection and use Linq Each Dictionary contains around 5000 keyvalue pairs. Also, please note I look for a highly computationally efficient solution because the frequency of lookups is quite high potentially many hundred thousand times each lookup is guaranteed to be different from any previous valuep

Negative 34113 pWe have a pretty complex web app built in meteor. The UI is mainly in nested HTML elements.

That is, we need to calculate the coordinate of a point in any elements, even the element has complex transforms.  We were using the webkitConvertPointFromPageToNode function in webkit browserswe only support webkit. to do the job.

Negative 34113 pIm trying to find an example of a navigation drawer that opens upwards for 14 of the screen. Id like to implement this, but it seems like that would be going against its intended use since the only two gravity options are start and left. p  pUltimately, Id like to implement this vertical opening functionality in a music playlist sort of app, because I think that the rewind, fastforward, and pause buttons take away from the minimal and unintrusive design of the app. Likewise, it just wouldnt make sense to have the side navigation drawer with a listview of the fast forward pause and rewind buttons.p  pFinally, I dont want to use a panel, because that opens up and eclipses the song entirely, whereas the buttons should only take up a 14 of the screen in order to retain a nonintrusive look.p  pIf I were forced to actually make this function, as opposed to using someone elses, are there any interesting mods of navigation drawer or similarp  pThank youp

Negative 34113 pIm really new to the ObjectiveC and Xcode environment, but Im trying to make a multiplayer quiz game app. p  pOn the startup screen, you choose how many players you want, then the following screen you enter usernames for each player. The game will then consist of 3 possible minigames a standard quiz game, an image quiz game and some card games really simple ones like higher or lower,red or black..., each mini game will be performed as many times as there are players, and this will loop infinitely so when all players have played one of the 3 mini games we switch to another mini game p  pSo the question is, should I use a single view controller or 3 separate ones, one for each mini gamep  pThanks in advance, I hope my question is not too stupid.p

Negative 34113 pI have 3 view controllers, all having a collection view in them with different layouts, everything works well and the only thing my question focuses on is the custom transition between view controllers introduced in iOS7 with the UIView animation block.p  pView Controllersp  pVC1 All Presentations view controller where there are thumbnails of all the presentations a user has. Its a 3xn collection view of thumbnail images scrolling vertically. At a time a max of 9 cells can be seen on the screen in VC1.p  pVC2 After selecting a specific presentation in VC1, we come to the next view controller which shows all the slides in that presentation. At a time 30 cells at max can be seen on the screen in VC2.p  pVC3 On tapping any slide from VC2, we come to VC3 where the same image is displayed on the whole screen. At max 2 slides can be seen on the screen at the same time when user is scrolling to the next slide in VC3.p  pNow here is the problemp  pThere are two options for the user,p  poption1 the user goes from vc1  vc2  vc3 option2 there is an illusion that the user goes from vc1 to vc3 directly, but because when popping vc3, I need to come to vc 2 and not vc1, so on view will appear of vc2, I push vc3.p  pBetween vc2 and vc3 there is a custom transition that happens, which is a zooming effect where it seems like a cell from vc2 zooms in. p  pWhen the user does option1, the transition is a bit laggy, when user chooses option 2, it works perfectly fine. I do not really get the reason why.p  ul liI use small sized images for when displaying the cells in vc2li liI am loading images in an async manner as wellli liI saw in some other places to make sure the background is white and not clear color, done thatli liThere is no real difference that is happening between option 1 and 2, only as I explained.li ul  pWhy would one have a lag in transition and the other be smooth  I am not sure which code would you like to see so if you comment what you would like to see, I can paste something. p  pThank You for your time.p

Negative 34113 pI am trying to create a pet project for the summer, which requires a large amount of information. I think the best way to do this would be to store all the data in a text file, and proceed to pull the necessary information from that file when its called upon. My question, though, is how to pull specific sets of information, and then proceed to store parts of that into an array perhaps or some other data structure which would allow for that to be more easily accessed during the execution of the program. The text file would have hundreds if not thousands of sets of data, and each set will have multiple parts. For example,p  precodeID001 Name Data1 Data2 Data3 TypeData  codepre  pWhere ID001 would just be an index, the name would be a string, the three Data would be integers, and the TypeData would be a String for example. What is the best way to go about taking all that information therell actually be more data per set but for simplicitys sake lets go with just this and separating it so each part is usable by a different part of the program Is this even the right way to go about doing something like this I was originally imagining something along the lines of a spreadsheet but I dont know how to use something quite like that as IO for a program.p
Negative 34113 pIt must be obvious, but I cant get a usecase of Delayed Job, cause due to rubys Gargabe Collector specific, it doesnt free memory back to OS. And once delayed job process will take all memory anyway. And the only way is to restart delayed job process.p  pBut if I restart delayed job process and there is currenlty running task  it will never be completed. Probably, there is some workaround to restart that task later, but this approach seems ugly to me.p  pI tried real jobs and some simple computatuin without any variables, symbols or links so I dont think that my code leaks. Still, every new job increases memory of delayedjob process.p  pMay be I use Delayed job for something that its not designed Or it could be environment problem besides, tried on local machine and on VPS p  pTested on Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 6 both x86, Rails 3.2, delayedjob 4.0.2, delayedjobactiverecord 4.0.1, ruby 2.1.2p  pI could give some code examples, but, as I mentioned, I tried both real job and simple computation. So I wont if it is not significant and my mistakes are fundamental.p  pDue to my conditions  my tasks can be executed for couple of minutes, read and write about 100K records to database and require a lot of computation, tasks cant be interrupted, and number of tasks limited by 1020 dayli, may be  I only guess to use Resque, because it forks process everytime, so there should be no problems with accumulating memory with time.p  pSo do I realy do something wrong or this is a nature of DJ  to occupie all memory or require a restart  and if I cant restart it, I shouldnt use its approach p  pEverything I read on the internet not so much, by the way tells that its rubys GC trouble that it doesnt free memory back to OS, and some advises to profile code for unlinked objects it sounds the most realistic to my case, but, I tried a lot with code that doesnt create any objects, and I explicitly set everything to nil and call GC.startp

Negative 34113 pIm working on a Linux kernel module which shares a piece of memory with user applications through the syscall mmap. The module works alright with the help of the mmap callback defined in the struct fileoperations, which informs the module when the syscall is invoked. p  pHowever, the problem comes out when user applications want to stop the sharing through syscall munmap. There is not an munmap callback or something that does similar work in the struct fileoperations. Therefore, I have to do another ioctl to inform the kernel module that the sharing has been revoked, which is both inconvenient and insecure.p  pDuring my search for the solution, I found that there was once an munmap callback defined. But it was removed when the kernel version was about 2.4 or some times after. p  pCan someone tell me why the munmap callback is removed or is there any alternative approach to inform the kernel module when an munmap syscall is calledp

Im pretty new to Camel and Spring so this is all foreign territory to me.p  pThe dataFormat mode is PAYLOAD, so I figured the SOAP header would be available after going through the inInterceptor and I have been attempting to parse it in a camelcamelContext route to no avail. p  pThe endpoint uses a wss4jInInterceptor if thats of any value.p  pDocumentation on this seems to be sparse, and Im just not sure where to go with it, any help would be appreciatedp  pThis is what the endpoint looks likep  precodeltcamelcxfcxfEndpoint idILDOCWebService      addressINTERNAL URL     wsdlURLMETAINFwsdlSIPVNPServiceCore.wsdl     serviceNamesVNPService     endpointNamesVNPSOAPPort     xmlnsshttpit.ojp.govVNExchange1.0wsgt      ltcamelcxfinInterceptorsgt         ltref beanwss4jInInterceptorgt         ltref beanwsAddressingInterceptorgt     ltcamelcxfinInterceptorsgt      ltcamelcxfoutInterceptorsgt         ltref beanwss4jOutInterceptorgt     ltcamelcxfoutInterceptorsgt      ltcamelcxfpropertiesgt         ltentry keydataFormat valuePAYLOAD gt         ltentry keypublishedEndpointUrl valueURL HIDDEN gt     ltcamelcxfpropertiesgt  ltcamelcxfcxfEndpointgt codepre  pAnd the route looks like thisp  precodeltcamelcamelContext xmlnsshttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope gt     ltcamelroute idILDOCWSNotifyingAgencyWSFileFromNotifyingAgencyWSClientgt         ltcamelfrom uricxfbeanILDOCWebServicegt         ltcamelsetHeader headerNamemsgIdgt             ltcamelxpathgtsHeaderMessageIdltcamelxpathgtltThis is where Im trying to get the messageId extracted gt         ltcamelsetHeadergt         ltcamellog loggingLevelINFO messageampgtampgtampgtMessageID  header.msgIDgt         ltcamelconvertBodyTo typejava.lang.Stringgt         ltcamellog loggingLevelINFO messageampgtampgtampgtBODY    bodygt         ltcamelmulticastgt             ltcamelpipelinegt                 ltcamelsetHeader headerNameCamelFileNamegt                     ltcamelsimplegtdatenowyyyyMMddHHmmssSSSmsgID.xmlltcamelsimplegt                 ltcamelsetHeadergt                 ltcamelto uriINTERNAL URL HIDDENgt             ltcamelpipelinegt             ltcamelpipelinegt                 ltcamelto urixsltMETAINFresponseMessage.xslgt             ltcamelpipelinegt         ltcamelmulticastgt     ltcamelroutegt ltcamelcamelContextgt codepre

Hopefully the below will explain itp  pI begin with a table that has the following informationp  precodeParty Id    Party Name    Party Code   Parent Id 1           Acme 1        ACME1        1 2           Acme 2        ACME2        1 3           Acme 3        ACME3        3 4           Acme 4        ACME4        4 5           Acme 5        ACME5        4 6           Acme 6        ACME6        6 codepre  pAs you can see this isnt perfect for a recursive CTE because rather than having a NULL where there isnt a parent record it is instead parented to itself see rows 1,3 and 6. Some however are parented normally.p  pI have therefore tried to amend this table in a CTE then refer to the output of that CTE as part of my recursive query... This doesnt appear to be running very well no errors yet so I wonder if I have managed to create an infinite loop or some other error that just slows the query to a crawl rather than killing itp  pMy Code is below... please pick it apartp  precodeThis is my attempt to clean the data and set records parented to themselves as the anchor  record WITH Parties AS Select CASE     WHEN CurParentId  PartyId THEN NULL     ELSE CurParentId END AS ActParentId , PartyId , CURPARTYCODE , CURPARTYNAME FROM EDW..TBDIMDPARTIES WHERE CURFLG  1,  In this CTE I referred to my clean records from above and then traverse through them looking at the actual parent record identified linkedParties AS  Select ActParentId, PartyId, CURPARTYCODE, CURPARTYNAME, 0 AS LEVEL FROM Parties WHERE ActParentId IS NULL  UNION ALL  Select p.ActParentId, p.PartyId, p.CURPARTYCODE, p.CURPARTYNAME, Level  1 FROM Parties p inner join linkedParties t on p.ActParentId  t.PartyId   Select  FROM linkedParties Order By Level codepre  pFrom the data I supplied earlier the results I would expect arep  precodeParty Id    Party Name    Party Code   Parent Id    Level 1           Acme 1        ACME1        1            0 3           Acme 3        ACME3        3            0 4           Acme 4        ACME4        4            0 6           Acme 6        ACME6        6            0 2           Acme 2        ACME2        1            1 5           Acme 5        ACME5        4            1 codepre  pIf everything seems to be OK then Ill assume its just a processing issue and start investigating that but I am not entirely comfortable with CTEs so wish to make sure the error is not mine before looking elsewhere.p  pMany Thanksp

Negative 34113 pI am working on a Cordova app, but have encountered a problem.  The problem I am facing occurs in a script where a hidden form is being submitted to an iframe to preview a file.

Negative 34113 pIm using OpenJPA 1.23 JPA 1.0 and WebSphere 7.0.0.15. Below is a simplified version of my entity. The real version has over 50 fields and many OneToMany relationships.p  precodeEntity public class Employee      Id    private Long id     ColumnnameFIRSTNAME    private String firstname     ColumnnameLASTNAME    private String lastname     ColumnnameSTATUS    private String status     OneToMany    private ListltOrdergt order      getters and setters    ...  codepre  pNormally to update an Employee record, you would do something like the following.p  precodeEmployee emp  em.findEmployee.class, 1 emp.setStatusACTIVE codepre  pHowever, in my case, the to be updated Employee entity is created by JAXB from XML, so I would need to merge it first. I then pass the merged entity to a method for further processing. For example,p  precodeEmployee emp  getEmployeeInstanceFromXml Employee mergedEmp  em.mergeemp processCustomLogicsmergedEmp codepre  pThe processCustomLogics is the entry point to over 4000 lines of custom logics that manipulate the passed in entity and could also adddelete other entities. The problem is that if a managed entity is passed in, OpenJPA would randomly flush incomplete or invalid state data to the database during the execution of the processCustomLogics method. So I thought, it would be a better idea to detach the entity before passing it in. So the code above becomes.p  precodeEmployee emp  getEmployeeInstanceFromXml Employee mergedEmp  em.mergeemp em.clear  Since this is JPA 1.0, I cant detach individual entity processCustomLogicsmergedEmp  merge the entity before commit  The issue is that, in the second merge, all the data in the mergedEmp  entity are overwritten with data from the database. Employee mergedAgainEmp  em.mergemergedEmp codepre  pSince the mergedAgainEmp contains the same data as the database, nothing gets written to the database. This seems to only happen when merging a detached entity that was previously attached.p  pI could use the apachecommonbeanutils BeanUtils.copyProperties... method to manually copy all the fields, but I prefer not to go this route as the my entity has multilevel childparent hierarchy.p  pAny pointer would be very helpful.p  pThanksp

Negative 34113 pWere having a problem with the application we have a page with a report on it filled from a database. When you click on an Export button on the form, it pops open a smaller window that uses the Report Viewer Control and seems to display the control wrapper but the main report keeps returning a 404 error for the report itself. p  pIt says that the file CTFSGReserved.ReportViewerWebControl.axd isnt found and from research, realize this a temp file thats created when the report viewer is invoked but as far as I can tell, the file is never created, whether using Firefox or IE11 and monitoring the Temporary Internet Files. From research weve checked the existence of the control in the web.config httpHandlers sections and it appears like it should be working normally. p  pThis error started happening when attempting to update an .rdlc report file that was being called adding a new column, but replacing the .rdlc file with an original version didnt fix the problem. Screenshot located below. p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comYD9A1cW relnofollowscreenshotap  pIs this a case of a file being cached that needs to be updated or removed, a configuration change, or something else entirelyp

Negative 34113 pso my project still gets an error.p  pMy ultimate goal is to create an int of arrays of say 100 to hold each digit of a number a user enters. So I essentially would have the array set to size 100, but if the user only enters 20 digits I would only point to the first 20 dimensions of the array and the rest would just be left unused.p  pI figured using dynamic arrays would be the best way.

Negative 34113 pI am trying to obtain the output of a fullscreen terminal program that uses redrawing escape codes to present data, and which requires a codettycode or codeptycode to run.p  pThe basic procedure a human would follow isp  ol liStart the program in a terminal.li liThe program uses redrawing to display and update various fields of data.li liThe human waits until the display is consistent possibly using cues such as its not flickering or its been 0.5s since the last update.li liThe human looks at the fields in certain positions and remembers or records the data.li liThe human exits the program.li liThe human then performs actions outside the program based on that data.li ol  pI would like to automate this process. Steps 4 and 5 can be done in either order. While the perfectionist in me is worried about selfconsistency of the screen state, I admit Im not really sure how to properly define this except perhaps to use its been more than a certain timeout period since the last update.p  pIt seems that using codeptycode and codesubprocesscode followed by some sort of screen scraper is one possible way to do this, but Im unclear on exactly how to use them all together, and what hazards exist with some of the lower level objects Im using.p  pConsider this programp  precodeusrbinenv python2 import os import pty import subprocess import time  import pexpect.ANSI   Psuedoterminal FDs fdmaster, fdslave  pty.openpty   Start theprogram theproc  subprocess.Popen[theprogram], stdinfdmaster, stdoutfdslave, stderrfdslave   Just kill it after a couple of seconds time.sleep2 theproc.terminate   Read output into a buffer outputbuffer  b readsize  None  while readsize is None or readsize gt 0     chunk  os.readfdmaster, 1024     outputbuffer  chunk     readsize  lenchunk  printoutput buffer size d.formatlenoutputbuffer   Feed output to screen scraper ansiterm  pexpect.ANSI.ANSI24, 80 ansiterm.writeoutputbuffer   Parse presented data...  codepre  pOne problem is that the codeos.readcode call blocks, always.

Negative 34113 pIm currrently writing a Linux device driver which maps a DMA buffer to user space by mmapping a sysfs file.

However, this takes quite some time for larger buffers e.g. 1GiB and more. External programs require to lower the time required for the mmap call in user space. My idea is to install a page fault handler and map each page on demand. p  pSo far I was not able to get this handler working.

In my test case the first access to the mapping is a memset call. The program crashes with an segfault if killed manually. Furthermore, the pagefault handler is called in a loop endlessly but always with pgoff  0.p  pObviously Im doing something wrong. Can anyone point out what exactly the problem isp

Negative 34113 pIm a few weeks in to my first experience with Rails  web development in general and have come across a snag I cant seem to find on overflow or work out. I feel that Im almost there but not quite...p  pIm developing a staff site for a charity, and need to categorize new staff members in order to assign privileges to each of them. Currently, I have a staff new view that creates new staff members, and have a nested form for type in it to add the staffs department at the same time. However, at the moment a new department is generated for every new member of staff. So if I created 2 staff with department Admin, I end up with 2 Admin departments with separate typeids instead of them being assigned to the same. How do I assign a staffs typedepartment as I create it in the form, assuming the departments already exist.

Negative 34113 pI am trying to solve the programming challenge outlined below, wherein basically you need to find the word in a given sentence with the greatest number of repeated characters. I have struggled a bit with this, and was lucky enough to find some code for counting the occurrences of letters in a string also below. This particular piece of code store all the letters in a HashMap, and I need to tailor it so that it stores the character occurrence of each word separately instead of in aggregate, as its doing at the moment. This is where I am stuck. What could I use to store the state of a HashMap with each iteration of its loopp  precode Using the Java language, have the function LetterCountIstr take    the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the    greatest number of repeated letters. For example Today, is the    greatest day ever should return greatest because it has 2 es    and 2 ts and it comes before ever which also has 2 es. If there    are no words with repeating letters return 1.

Negative 34113 pI am new to this and could not find something similar here. Other articles talk about a hrefhttpswww.addedbytes.comarticlesforbeginnersurlrewritingforbeginners relnofollowurl rewritea, but not clearly about how to query from my database tables. p  pHow to URL Rewrite struts .action in Tomcat 7 with readable hyphen separated text for the client  TomcatStruts needs to extract some text from that url QUERY database for a corresponding internal element id, and then process the request.  This rewrite needs to work both ways so the client always sees readable url in the response and can bookmark the page using readable url.  p  pstrongHere is what I mean using an example.strongp  pCurrently, our web application Tomcat 7, Struts, MySQL, JAVA serves the url with .action which does not change while the user is navigating in our website because we use a few hidden parameters.     p  precodewww.domain.comwelcome.action codepre  pThis means they cannot bookmark the specific articlespages.  p  pWhat we want is for the url to show something like this p  precodewww.domain.comTheBestCars2015HappyAuthor1 codepre  pInternally we will extract parts of the texturl that the user requests i.e.  browser bookmarks using Regular expressions into parameters in our case articletitleTheBestCars2015 and authorHappyAuthor1 would be two parameters and then look up by QUERYING the internal element id  using those parameters on the server side from our database, articletitleTheBestCars2015 and authorHappyAuthor1 maps to articleidarticle1150.  So we are going to display www.domain.comTheBestCars2015HappyAuthor1 url for the client.br If the client clicks on some other link inside that page, we need the server to be able to serve another readable url that can be bookmarked as such.  p  pIn the other examples we see here, regex is used to extract some text and is then substituted in the url in a readable format.  p  pBut its not clear to me how to actually take this extracted parameter from the url, and then query from our database for internal element id.  Some other answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28446293urlrewritewithqueryparameterisnotworkingherea talk about using the following two...p  precodelturlrewrite usequerystringtruegt matchtyperegexp codepre  p... but it seems that just turns ON the query functionality... how do we actually specify the target tables for that query, execute that query and then handle the results of that queryp

Negative 34113 pI have an OpenGL visualizer using OpenTK. Its supposed to open a mesh file in the PLY format, and display it. The user is able to move around the object, rotate or scale it. At the end, the user should be able to save the mesh into a PLY file from the exact same view that heshe sees it before saving.  p  pIve abstracted the mesh object into a class. Here is what the class sort of looks like  p  precodepublic class Mesh      Vector3d vertices[]     int[] triangleIndices      Matrix4d translation  Matrix4d.Identity     Matrix4d rotation  Matrix4d.Identity     Matrix4d scale  Matrix4d.Identity      int vboHandle     int faceHandle      public void Draw          GL.PushMatrix                    Apply transformations                      Do VBO drawing stuff           ...           GL.PopMatrix       codepre  pWhat Im doing is loading the PLY file as a VBO. When the mesh is to be drawn, I apply the translation first, apply a rotation around the center of the object by finding the objects centroid, translating the coordinate system, rotating and translating back and then in the same manner as the rotation apply scaling.  p  pThis works fine and the visualizer draws the mesh correctly. However, when I want to save, I dont know how I can apply the same set of transformations to all vertices and write the PLY file.br I tried doing this pretty much mimicking what I have for the codeDrawcode method abovep  precodeforint i  0  i ltthis.vertices.Length i        Apply the transformations     Vector3d transformed  Vector3d.Transformthis.vertices[i], this.translation      Handle rotation     Matrix4d centerTrans  Matrix4d.CreateTranslationCenter      transformed  Vector3d.Transformtransformed, centerTrans     transformed  Vector3d.Transformtransformed, this.rotation     centerTrans  Matrix4d.CreateTranslationCenter     transformed  Vector3d.Transformtransformed, centerTrans       Handle scale     centerTrans  Matrix4d.CreateTranslationCenter      transformed  Vector3d.Transformtransformed, centerTrans     transformed  Vector3d.Transformtransformed, this.scale     centerTrans  Matrix4d.CreateTranslationCenter     transformed  Vector3d.Transformtransformed, centerTrans      result[i]  transformed  codepre  pBut the problem is that the output is a little bit off especially when a rotation is applied to the object.p  pMy main question here is how I can fix this and what is the correct way of going about this problem.p  pPS. I know that my approach is probably archaic, childish and wrong with the whole mesh rendering thing and considering OpenGL best practices, but Im creating this visualizer to solve a completely unrelated and much bigger problem. So In a way Im hacking things for my purposes. Any suggestions regarding a good approach for this problem are highly appreciated.p  pPS2. The reason for multiple codeMatrix4dcode transforms is that I always want the rotation to be applied to the center of the object and I didnt know any other way to achieve the same effect.p
Negative 34113 pI wrote generic interface and over time, I started using it quite often.

It could be also quite fragile when using wrong type given to interface.p  pThis led me to obvious idea creating yet another layer of interfaces to encapsulate concrete usage. That would solve issues described above, in other hand I will end up with trillion empty interfaces for every possible implementation.p  precode ICountryConfigProvider  IConfigProviderltICountryConfiggt container.RegisterTypeltICountryConfigProvider, CountryConfigProvidergt   ILanguageConfigProvider  IConfigProviderltILanguageConfiggt container.RegisterTypeltILanguageConfigProvider, LanguageConfigProvidergt   ILocaleConfigProvider  IEnumerableConfigProviderltILocaleConfiggt container.RegisterTypeltILocaleConfigProvider, LocaleConfigProvidergt codepre  pAnd its cleaner usagep  precodepublic LocaleResolverICountryConfigProvider countryConfigProvider, ...       ...  codepre  pAnd what Im looking for now is a good advice.

Clouds have many different shapes  thousands of little cumulus in a medium area or a huge cyclon hiding everything.pli lipWhile at day, clouds hide the ground, they scatter city and lightning lights at night.pli lipAt the terminator, while the ground is yet dark, biggest clouds can still be enlightened. While shadows can often be negligeable at day, cumulonimbus can there have huge and magestic casted shadows no question to cast shadows given the cost.pli lipAfter 23 revolutions 46 hours the cloud layer cant be exactly the same, but cant be completely different too  a hurricane cant disappear.pli lipAt this distance the parallax effect is visible and awesome even with the smallest clouds.pli ol  pAs far as ive seen, even expensive realtime meteorological online resources are not useful  they aim rainy or stormy clouds with help of UV and IR lightwaves, so they dont catch 100 of them and dont give the normal view we all know. Moreover the rare good cloud textures shot in visible light hardly differentiate ground from clouds  sometimes a 5000kmlong coast stands among nowhere. Of course a server could use those images to create better textures.p  h1Solutionsh1  pIve imagined many solutions  a cloud tiled map built on the server every 46 hours, based on realtime imagery  a fragment shader  a vertex shader  shaders based on the tiled map p  pExpected answers are a list of the different steps one could follow, for example  p  ol liA server parses a meteo satellite image to deduce where are the highlow pressure zones li liThen it creates an image or better, a tiledmap  it assigns different kinds of predrawed pictures of clouds in the areas they could be met, coupled with their predrawed bumpmapsli liIt enlights these areas on terminatoron citiesli liAnd creates a lightmap with casted shadows from the bumpmap and cloud position.li ol  pThis example involves image creationediting but no shader  the output is a picture or a tiled mapbumpmaps. p  pOf course comments of each steps would be appreciated here particularly step1.p  pAny solution, even partial or implying to code a whole meteorological system is welcome as long as it is expected to work.p  pIf you think that it is really impossible, even for a monster computer, just detail why. p

Negative 34113 pI have a table displayed using PHP. There are only two rows, the first row contains the headers, second row contains text box inside the td. What I am trying to do in this part of my script is for the user to enter some values, then I would like to grab the values according to the header names so that I can use them for a query.p  pI have created the table headers and text boxes according to how many headers there are as you can see in the codes below. This is inside one function, other parts are just the codes for the table and queries.p  pNow my main problem is that I want to get the values of each text box according to the headers. An example would be if the header is called codeConfigurationcode and the value in the text box under that header is the user has typed in code1,5,8code. After a button click, a new PHP function would be executed. This function is the one Im working on to get the text box values. Ive tried iterating through the table cells in Javascript but Im stuck at getting the text box values.p  pIf possible, I would like to know how all the headers can be stored in an array in Javascript, the text box values to be stored accordingly as well. If it were in PHP itd be something like codeuserinput[header][textval]code. Or just separate arrays would be fine as well as long as I am able to get the values that correspond to the headers so that I can use it in my query.p  pNote I am using ajaxs post to pass back values to my PHP file. The table is created with dynamic values so itll be getting the values in the same PHP file and passing it back to there as well called database.php.

Negative 34113 pI am wondering how I might go about using the codeReactiveCocoacode library to codeRACcodeify codeUIApplicationDelegatecode lifecycle events.p  pSince the most important one is code BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptionscode, that seems like a logical place to start to me.p  pThe basic idea, if I understand correctly, would be to create a codeRACSignalcode that would encapsulate the event application finished launching with these options, send it either serially through a pipeline or in parallel to multiple application start handlers and then merge all of their outputs  if serially, then only continue when each returns codeYEScode, if parallel, codeif handler1  YES ampamp handler2  YES ...code  and then codereturncode the combined response in the actual codeUIApplicationDelegatecode.p  pHowever, I am fuzzy on the precise details of how this would be accomplished  which is probably evident from my line of questioning.p  pAny examples, either in real code or just pseudocode, would be greatly appreciated. It would for me and probably others serve a dual purpose 1 the stated one, and 2 provide an example of how to codeRACcodeify a nonUIdriven event well, thats not even exactly true, but I think you see what I mean.p

Negative 34113 pI have a problem in Polymer 1.0 related to event propagation within a nested structure of web components. In particular, I am trying to dynamically configure a web component named codewcsplitcode by means of a collection of other components named codewcsplitrulecode located within its local DOM. The following snippet of code shows a correct form of usep  precodeltwcsplittestgt     ltwcsplitgt         ltwcsplitrule keyk1 ...gtltwcsplitrulegt         ltwcsplitrule keyk2 ...gtltwcsplitrulegt         ltwcsplitrule keyk3 ...gtltwcsplitrulegt    ltwcsplitgt  ltwcsplittestgt codepre  pAs it can be seen in the previous example, the aim is to provide to the codewcsplitcode component the values on codekeycode attributes within each codewcsplitrulecode component. As we need dynamic reconfiguration capabilities, the architectural strategy starts by firing an event each time a change in codekeycode attributes is met and those changes are promoted by bubbling up to reach the codewcsplitcode component, which process them. p  pThe followed approach works properly when [1] it is both tested in a pure HTML context with literal values and [2] within a component template with databound values. Nevertheless, [3] when it is tested within a component template using literal values,  changes are not promoted. It seems that event propagation are ignored or listener defined in codewcsplitcode does not catch the eventp  precodeltwcsplittestgt     ltwcsplitgt lt does not work gt         ltwcsplitrule keyk1 ...gtltwcsplitrulegt         ltwcsplitrule keyk2 ...gtltwcsplitrulegt         ltwcsplitrule keyk3 ...gtltwcsplitrulegt     ltwcsplitgt ltwcsplittestgt codepre  pThe following listing shows implementation of both components [a hrefhttpsgoo.glOkU9jQ] relnofollowhttpsgoo.glOkU9jQ]ap  precode    ltdommodule idwcsplitrulegt         ltscriptgt                             Polymer                 is wcsplitrule,                    properties                      key                            type String,                         reflectToAttribute true,                         notify true,                         value ,                         observer changed                     ,                 ,                   changed function                      this.firewcsplitrule,                          key      this.key,                                                                                         ltscriptgt     ltdommodulegt       ltdommodule idwcsplitgt            lttemplategt            ltcontentgtltcontentgt                  lttemplategt          ltscriptgt                  Polymer                   is wcsplit,                   listeners                      wcsplitrule onRule                 ,                  ready function                    ...                 ,                  onRule function event, context                     ...  this is executed in test [1] and [2] NOT in [3]                                                                    ltscriptgt      ltdommodulegt       ltdommodule idwcsplittestgt                   lttemplategt                           ltwcsplit idsplitgt                 ltwcsplitrule keye1gt                                     ltwcsplitgt                     lttemplategt          ltscriptgt                  ...         ltscriptgt      ltdommodulegt codepre  pSurprisingly, the same code on Polymer 0.5 works properly for each test scenario [a hrefhttpsgoo.glCHV3JE] relnofollowhttpsgoo.glCHV3JE]ap  precode    ltpolymerelement namewcsplitrulegt           ltscriptgt              Polymerwcsplitrule,                  publish                       key      ,                                        ,                  observe                      key      changed,                                        ,                  changed function                      this.firewcsplitrule,                          key      this.key,                                                                                         ltscriptgt     ltpolymerelementgt       ltpolymerelement namewcsplitgt         lttemplategt             ltdiv onwcsplitruleonRulegt                 ltcontent selectwcsplitrulegtltcontentgt             ltdivgt             ltcontentgtltcontentgt                 lttemplategt         ltscriptgt              Polymerwcsplit,                                       ready function                     ...                 ,                                     onRule function event, context                     ...  this is always executed                                            ltscriptgt      ltpolymerelementgt        ltpolymerelement namewcsplittestgt         lttemplategt                           ltwcsplit idsplitgt                 ltwcsplitrule keye1gt                                     ltwcsplitgt                     lttemplategt          ltscriptgt             ...         ltscriptgt      ltpolymerelementgt        codepre

Negative 34113 pIn my Windows application I needed to implement the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiPBKDF2 relnofollowPBKDF2a encryption for passwords. For that I needed to calculate a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiHashbasedmessageauthenticationcode relnofollowHMACa using SHA256 many times over. So for a single round of that I was calling the following sequence of APIsp  precodeFor simplicity Im not posting the full code One can look up implementation of HMACSHA256 in C CryptAcquireContext, NULL, MSENHANCEDPROV, PROVRSAFULL, CRYPTVERIFYCONTEXT  CRYPTNEWKEYSET CryptImportKey, , 0, CRYPTIPSECHMACKEY,  CryptCreateHash, CALGHMAC, , 0,  CryptSetHashParam, HPHMACINFO, , 0 CryptHashData, , , 0 CryptGetHashParam, HPHASHVAL, NULL, , 0 CryptGetHashParam, HPHASHVAL, , , 0 codepre  pThis sequence may be called on the order of 10,000 times in a sort of a loop according to PBKDF2 specifications.p  pI started noticing though, that if I run this sequence via CtrlF5 in Visual Studio, or without a debugger, it executes in about less than 1 sec on my laptop. But if I attach a debugger to the process, it runs painfully slow  sometimes close to 10 seconds or so. The timing in this case is also inconsistent.p  pSo I thought that this happens because of a debugger build. So I tried building a release build and then attached a debugger. To my amazement it was also running slow.p  pSo Im curious, is there something in those crypto APIs that make them run slower with the debugger attachedp

Negative 34113 pIs it possible to specify the century natively with codelubridatecodep  pI ask because I have a long list of dates in the form ddmmyy from present day until 1890. When I use codelubridatedmycode, lubridate does a good job of recent dates, but when it gets to dates in 1999, it starts translating 99, 98, 97, etc. into 2099, 2098, 2097, etc.p  pI understand that I can perform some string operations to add in the missing 20 and 19 and 18s, but I am just wondering if something can be done natively.p

Negative 34113 pI want to know how to generate reports in WPF app. I found some tutorial in msdn. They say that i need to add new reference to Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms  But I dont have such thing on list. I want to design report in Visual Studio and open it with code.p
Negative 34113 pIm writing a emSwiftem command line tool that uses codeNSTaskcode to interact with codegitcode. In the simplest scenario I want to run three commands codeinitcode, codeadd .code, and codecommit m Initial Commitcode. I intend to use a separate codeNSTaskcode for each command, and want to house each command in its own function  returning codetruecode if the task succeeded or codefalsecode if it didnt. This setup would allow my codemaincode function to look like thisp  precodefunc main       if runInit          if runStage              if runCommit                   NSLogsuccess                             codepre  pTo accomplish this each of the three functions must do the following before returning i launch the task ii wait for it to complete, iii obtain whatever is in codestdoutcode, and iv set the return value codetruecode or codefalsecode. Heres what Ive got for the commit stagep  precodefunc runCommit gt Bool       var retval  false      var commitTask  NSTask     commitTask.standardOutput  NSPipe     commitTask.launchPath  gitPath     commitTask.arguments  [commit, m, Initial Commit]     commitTask.currentDirectoryPath  demoProjectURL.path      commitTask.standardOutput.fileHandleForReading.readToEndOfFileInBackgroundAndNotify      nc.addObserverForNameNSFileHandleReadToEndOfFileCompletionNotification,         object commitTask.standardOutput.fileHandleForReading,         queue nil  note gt Void in              get the output, log it, then...             if commitTask.terminationStatus  EXITSUCCESS                  retval  true                         commitTask.launch     commitTask.waitUntilExit      return retval   codepre  pMy question is essentially about how codewaitUntilExitcode works, particularly in conjunction with the notification I sign up for to enable me to get the output. Apples docs say p  blockquote   pThis method first checks to see if the receiver is still running using isRunning. Then it polls the current run loop using NSDefaultRunLoopMode until the task completes.p blockquote  pIm a bit out of my depth when it comes to run loop mechanics, and was wondering what this means in this context  can I safely assume that my notification block will strongalwaysstrong be executed before the enclosing function returnsp
