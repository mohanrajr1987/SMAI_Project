Positive 4985 pI am quite a UX junkie and so far have been able to order, defer, async javascript. But the thing with image is I dont know how to paint it following the order I want. p  pSo for example I want the background to be painted first before any other things. How do I achieve that Because now the order of image is very random. p  pPlease help. Thank you.p

Positive 4985 pIm very new at this.p  pIn my searching for the process in doing this correct I ran into a few things that I dont have access to. I want to obtain the JSON of a image website that has a particular type of images and I want to have them streamed to my app. p  pThat is the simplified explanation of what Im trying to accomplish. What I know now in being a beginner is that I have to have an API Key and a JSON I believe.p  pIf Im not getting the concept of this please correct me, but the question here is how can I get the these certain images on my app from the internet from a location that I create This is the only option I can think of from already searching for a image hosting site that contains only the images I want in my app.p

Positive 4985 pI have a WCF service which provides an endpoint to dynamically generate a QRCode image. The image is first written to a memory stream codetempStreamcode. I then have the following code in the endpointp  precodeHttpResponse response  HttpContext.Current.Response response.Clear response.ClearContent response.ClearHeaders  response.Buffer  false response.ContentType  imagepng response.CacheControl  NoCache  response.AddHeaderContentLength, tempStream.Length.ToString response.AddHeaderAcceptRanges, bytes  tempStream.WriteToresponse.OutputStream  response.Flush response.End codepre  pIt works fine in Firefox. The image is downloaded if I hit the endpoint manually and it loads inline if I reference the endpoint as the codesrccode attribute in an codeimgcode tag. However, in IE, the image does not load inline in an codeimgcode tag, and if I try to hit the endpoint manually, it loads the full image the first time but any subsequent refreshes seemingly until the browser is restarted, it only loads part of the image.p  pUpon inspection of the network tab in the F12 window, it seems to be downloading exactly 1.00 KB of data including headers from the server, meaning it gets about 750 KB of image data. Then it makes another identical request to the server and gets only the headers back with no image data. The codeContentLengthcode header is set correctly to the size of the image IE just doesnt download that much. Again, Firefox is fine.p  pMy coworker recommended that I set codetransferModecode to codeStreamedcode in codeWeb.configcode, which I did, but that didnt work either. How can I get IE to download the entire image in one gop  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI should note that when running the WCF service in Visual Studios IIS Express server, Internet Explorer works fine. It is only when the application is deployed to IIS 7.5 that the problem occurs. Firefox works fine in both environments.p
Positive 4985 pI am doing a very interesting Computer Vision project which talks about how to create manually images with Matlab.p  pThe teacher gave me three matrices the strongilluminant matrix called Estrong, the strongcamera sensitivity matrix called Rstrong and finally, the strongsurface reflectance matrix called Sstrong.

Positive 4985 pIm testing a responsive website where a different image is used if a browser is reduced in size or when viewed on a phone. For example, if the browser window is more then 900 wide image is used with dimensions 200, 125. when browser window is between 650 and 899 wide an image used with dimensions 150, 110 and when browser window size  width is lower then 650 an image is used with dimensions 100,75.

Positive 4985 pI have a picture like the one below. The black square is the main window, the red one is a JLabel where I have an image . I want to crop the image without incurring exceptions like y  height exception... or things like that.I mean , in this moment I got that exception when I start to select the picture with the rectangle and then I go outside the picture. If I begin to select the image with the rectangle within the image , and I end outside it , even on the one hand , I got an exception . It also have to work if I resize the window, in my opinion the rectangle dont have to go out from the image, but How   What is the best approach to take  I do not type the code at the moment because I

Positive 4985 pI would like to generate 3D white objects in blackwhite images using Matlabs nlfilter or a similar functiontool. p  pIn 2D, I start with some white seed points, which eventually define the regionsobjects in my 2D image. By applying nlfilter successively, I can naturally grow these regions until all pixels are labeled. Id like to do a similar thing in 3D, but nlfilter works only on 2D images. Treating a 3D image as a stack of 2D images and applying nlfilter on each such slice is one of the possible ways to overcome this problem, but its not suboptimal. Instead, an nlfilter3d function would have been much more convenient.  Does any similar function exist in Matlab or elsewherep

Positive 4985 pI have a image in the size of 1024x768 and I have the same image in small resolution of 400x300. I am using the small image for cropping. So, user can crop the small image and I can get the cropping coordinates for the small image. I need to crop the same position in the large size image.

I load the first two images of my gallery and for some reasons the ProgressBar gets stuck.p  pIt does not disappear even if the image is loaded it still stuck.

Positive 4985 pI am making a basic game, and for some reason when the map, a single BufferedImage of type INTRGB is moved along the x axis, the outer left and right edges of the image flicker. This does not happen in reverse, when I move the image along the Y axis. Even when I set it up to draw the same image using hundreds of tiles, it still only flickers along the outer left and right edges of the image as whole not the outer edges of each separately drawn tile image. The flicker starts at the top and travels down, as if more and more of the image is moved along the x axis. Here is how the BufferedImage is set up, with some editingp  precodeGraphics private BufferedImage image private Graphics2D g  image  new BufferedImageConstants.WIDTH, Constants.HEIGHT, BufferedImage.TYPEINTRGB g  Graphics2Dimage.getGraphics  private void draw      gsm.drawg   private void drawToScreen      Graphics g2  getGraphics     g2.drawImageimage, 0, 0, Constants.WIDTH, Constants.HEIGHT, null      g2.dispose  codepre  pWith draw and drawToScreen being called at 60 fps and gsm being a game state manager. This is then handled in the actual game class like thisp  precodepublic void drawGraphics2D g      Draw Background         g.setColorColor.black         g.fillRect0, 0, Constants.WIDTH, Constants.HEIGHT         g.drawImageAssets.test, intxOffset, intyOffset, null      codepre  pA black background in draw, then the image. Assets.test is the BufferedImage, and xOffset and yOffset draw it with certain offset based on the players input aka, movement. I can also draw it like thisp  precodepublic void drawGraphics2D g      Draw Background         g.setColorColor.black         g.fillRect0, 0, Constants.WIDTH, Constants.HEIGHT         forint i  0 i lt yLength i              forint l  0 l lt xLength l                  g.drawtileMap[l][i].getImage, l  Constants.TILESIZE  intxOffset, Constants.TILESIZE  i  intyOffset, null                        codepre  pHere, tileMap[l][i] is each image, with tileMap being a double array of tiles, each storing a solidity value and an image. Constants.TILESIZE is the size of each tile, and xOffset and yOffset are the same thing as before.p  pHowever, drawing it this way has the same effect as the other, just with less performance. As I said at the start, the lines still only flicker on the outer edges of the WHOLE IMAGE, not each tile, which strikes me as being odd. I dont recall these lines having always flickered, but I couldnt say when they started doing so. What is causing this and how can I fix itp  pPlease let me know if more code is needed, or if there are any typos or other answers to questions like this. I did not see any, but that does not mean they do not exist.p  pThank you very muchp

So maybe instead of this linep  precode      if img1.getRGBx  xs, y  ys  img2.getRGBx, y                      return false        codepre  pI am looking for a way to make it so that it does thisp  precode      if img1.getRGBx  xs, y  ys is not within plus or minus SOMEFACTOR of img2.getRGBx, y                      return false        codepre  pOr maybe that is not the best way to go about this.p

Negative 4985 pWell, after a long time writing .net programs in C I started to feel angry and frustrated about all that syntactic trash that comes with statically typed languages. Now I want to change to dynamically typed languages, that takes advantage of CLI. So I searched a bit around and I didnt like of what I saw. I first looked for IronPython. But the project feels disorganized, it just didnt look well at all. Then I heard about Boo. I liked boos, the ideal and all, but it kinda feels like the project is halted. Then I heard of IronRuby, but the project is still at beta, and so I decided to wait until it gets more mature.p  pSo as I couldnt find a good CLR compatible dynamic language, Im asking you guys what do youwould you usep  pSince people started asking what is the reason for not choosing IronPython. Well the reason is, like I stated earlier, it seems disorganized. Whyp  p1 The homepage points to another page at codeplex, the homepage should be clean and just point the advantages of IronPython, take the IronRuby page as an example a hrefhttpwww.ironruby.net relnofollowhttpwww.ironruby.neta its that hides languagedevelopent stuff from the usereven though the user has to access IronRubys svn prior using it. What kind of issues IPython was trying to addres when it was created. Is there a page with that kind of information Well the page is there, but its hidden on the More Information Page among a bunch of meaningless links to articles.  On Boos page its at clear sight named as Manifesto a hrefhttpboo.codehaus.orgBooManifesto.pdf relnofollowhttpboo.codehaus.orgBooManifesto.pdfa .p  pThere is more but the feeling that I have is that IPython is just a homebrewed interpreter, despite the quality that it can actually have. I felt that it was safer to download Boo and use IronPythonbut no worries Microsoft I had also downloaded IPython.p  pAbout DuckTyping and Boos static typing they both seems to work fine for me.p

Negative 4985 pA bit of a newbie question on rails associations.p  pI have a Bug model, and a Status model. Status is basically just a keyvalue pair table.

Go   back and look at how I described the   problem, and youll see that it works.   With belongsto, the table accepts   responsibility for the foreign key. So   Content has a contenttemplateid. And   ContentTemplate doesnt need anything.   I can point to it at will. Done.p blockquote  pBug belongsto Status would be more appropriate since Bug should take the foreign key. Semantically, his example makes sense, but mine makes none. Is this just a quirk of rails where in this situation it looks odd, or am I not understanding somethingdoing it wrongp
Negative 4985 pI have a pretty serious multithreaded debugging problem.  I have some kind of timing issue when interacting with a serial device, and I need to track it down.  I have three threadsp  ol liThe main thread for UI updates.  The user can either change one parameter of the device, or many all at once by choosing a preset.li liThe status checking thread that queries to make sure that the device is still attached.  If the user shuts off the device or the device itself is interacted with in an interesting way, the status changes need to be reflected in the UI.li liThe thread that reads the serial port where the device responds.li ol  pMy problem actually has to do with debugging this situation.  It seems like every single line I have in each thread has to have a breakpoint in order to be debugged if I break in one thread, the debugger wont step through that thread.  I understand that the other threads will continue to update, but shouldnt the thread Im on execute like normal in the debugger, ie, go from one line to the next  Then, I could use the threads tab to switch between threads.p  pI mention that Im in WPF because I dont know if that changes the situation at all maybe it does, maybe it doesnt.  The status checking thread is part of a UI control, because the status needs to only be checked while the UI is up.  That control is in a library distinct from the main application.p

Negative 4985 pIm using python for my shopping cart class which has a list of items. When a customer wants to edit an item, I need to pass the JavaScript frontend some way to refer to the item so that it can call AJAX methods to manipulate it.p  pBasically, I need a simple way to point to a particular item that isnt its index, and isnt a reference to the object itself.p  pI cant use an index, because another item in the list might be added or removed while the identifier is held by the front end. If I were to pass the index forward, if an item got deleted from the list then that index wouldnt point to the right object.p  pOne solution seems to be to use UUIDs, but that seems particularly heavyweight for a very small list.

Negative 4985 pFirstly this has turned out to be quite a long post so please bear with me as its not too difficult but you may need to clarify something with me if i havent explained it correctly. So with some help the other day from guys on this forum, i managed to partially set up my mapClass class, but im having trouble with it and its not running correctly so i would like some help if possible. I will post the code below so you can see.p  pWhat Ive got is a Dundrum class which sets up the listView for an array of items.p  pThen ive got a dundrumSelector class which I use to set up the setOnClickListener methods on the listItems and link them to their correct views.p  pTHIS IS MY DUNDDRUM SELECTOR CLASS....p  precode    public static final int BUTTON1  R.id.anandaAddressButton public static final int BUTTON2  R.id.bramblesCafeAddressButton public static final int BUTTON3  R.id.brannigansAddressButton codepre  blockquote   ppublic void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState           super.onCreatesavedInstanceStatep blockquote  precode    int position  getIntent.getExtras.getIntposition      ifposition  0         setContentViewR.layout.ananda          ifposition  1         setContentViewR.layout.bramblescafe          ifposition  2         setContentViewR.layout.brannigans codepre  blockquote precodeButton anandabutton  Button findViewByIdR.id.anandaAddressButton anandabutton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener  codepre blockquote  precode    public void onClickView view          Intent myIntent  new Intentview.getContext,MapClass.class         myIntent.putExtrabutton, BUTTON1         startActivityForResultmyIntent,0          Button bramblesbutton  Button findViewByIdR.id.bramblesCafeAddressButton bramblesbutton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener       public void onClickView view          Intent myIntent  new Intentview.getContext,MapClass.class         myIntent.putExtrabutton, BUTTON2         startActivityForResultmyIntent, 0        codepre  petc etc....p  pThen what i did was set up static ints to represent the buttons which you can see at the top of this class, the reason for this is because in my mapClass activity I just want to have one method, because the only thing that is varying is the coordinates to each location. ie. i dont want to have 100 map classes essentially doing the same thing other than different coordinates into the method.p  pSo my map class is as follows...p  precodecase DundrumSelector.BUTTON1         handleCoordinates53.288719,6.241179         break     case DundrumSelector.BUTTON2         handleCoordinates53.288719,6.241179         break     case DundrumSelector.BUTTON3         handleCoordinates53.288719,6.241179         break           private void handleCoordinatesString l, String b       mapView  MapView findViewByIdR.id.mapView     LinearLayout zoomLayout  LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.zoom     View zoomView  mapView.getZoomControls      zoomLayout.addViewzoomView,             new LinearLayout.LayoutParams                 LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                  LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT          mapView.displayZoomControlstrue      mc  mapView.getController     String coordinates[]  l, b     double lat  Double.parseDoublecoordinates[0]     double lng  Double.parseDoublecoordinates[1]      p  new GeoPoint             int lat1E6,             int lng1E6      mc.animateTop     mc.setZoom17     mapView.invalidate    codepre  pNow this is where my problem is. The onClick events dont even work from the listView to get into the correct views. I have to comment out the methods in DundrumSelector before I can get into their views.p  pAnd this is what I dont understand, firstly why wont the onClick events work, because its not even on that next view where the map is.p  pI know this is a very long post and it might be quite confusing so let me know if you want any clarification..p  pJust to recap, what im trying to do is just have one class that sets up the map coordinates, like what im trying to do in my mapClass.p  pPlease can someone help or suggest another way of doing this  Thanks alot everyone for reading this.p

Negative 4985 pI made a bunch of little individual pictures, each with a separate CALayer, and theyre supposed to fade in and out asynchronously at different rates.  Each has a background sublayer and a fill sublayer.  A timer runs in the background to animate each one individually at specific moments.

Could you please help me make it so that it only animates one image at a time  p  pEDIT I should have been clearer.  Timing isnt the problem.

Negative 4985 pIm creating a PHP library for a thirdparty sites REST API.  The library will be released under an appropriate FOSS license so others may use it.  The thirdparty site has APIs for both authenticated and unauthenticated requests.  For authenticated requests, theyve chosen a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOAuth relnofollowOAutha.p  pAs with most things PHP, there is no one single best way to work with OAuth.  So far, Ive identified a handful of OAuth implementationsp  ul lia hrefhttppecl.php.netpackageoauth relnofollowPECLs OAuth extensiona, almost considered 1.0 quality.li lia hrefhttppear.php.netpackageHTTPOAuth relnofollowPEARs HTTPOAutha, but its still considered alpha quality.li lia hrefhttpframework.zend.commanualenzend.oauth.introduction.html relnofollowZend Frameworks ZendOautha, pretty stable and doesnt require the app be written using ZF.li lia hrefhttpcode.google.compoauthphp relnofollowoauthphpa, the top Google hit for codephp oauthcode.li ul  pThe variety of available libraries is problem.  A major part of OAuth 1 is emsigning the requestem.  This means that in order to make a request to the REST API, I have to go through one of the libraries.  Im trying to avoid bundling one of the OAuth libraries with my code, and simply allow coders that will use the library to pick which OAuth library to use in their own code.  I consider this important because of how complex OAuth can be to understand for some coders, and its emvery important that the coder using my library be comfortable and familiar with OAuthem.p  pIve done this by creating an Interface designed to wrap the OAuth objects and present a standardized way for my library code to make signed HTTP requests.  So far Ive created support for the PECL, PEAR and Zend libraries, with the oauthphp library next on the list.  Because the API also allows unauthenticated requests, Ive also created adapters for PHP streams and HTTP request libraries that the PEAR and Zend packages require.  PHP streams are used by default without any configuration needed, because theyre built in and guaranteed to be available.p  pThis has ended up being a nontrivial amount of work and makes the code emlookem far more complex and imposing than it really is.  The code Just Workstm, and doing that requires a lot of magic like automatically picking the HTTP adapter based on the class name of the passed OAuth object this also allows users to create their own adapters without changing the library.p  pIm beginning to think that it might be better to bundle an OAuth library with my code.  OAuth is defined by an RFC, and all of the linked libraries implement it correctly.  I can simply have the user provide the various keyssecretstokens and do the work myself, at the cost of adding a requirement of an entire OAuth implementation emthat the user did not pickem.  Thats a big downside, in my opinion.  Further, theres a question of license compatibility.  The library Id have to pick is available under a very liberal FOSS license, while Id prefer a more restrictive FOSS license for my own code.p  pstrongtldrstrong For a reusable library, should I strongcontinue using pluggable HTTP adaptersstrong and letting the user decide which OAuth library or nonOAuth HTTP library to use, strongor should I decide for the userstrong and simply bundle another library with my ownp

Negative 4985 pJust started reading on random way point mobility for MANET. I found a lot of work implements this model. Hence, I assumed the Matlab code will be available which I could look into to understand it better. Unfortunately, I found none. p  pAny body can suggest any good tutorial or codes available on random way point  Help appreciated. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong p  pRandom Waypoint RWP model is a commonly used synthetic model for mobility, e.g., in Ad Hoc networks. It is an elementary model which describes the movement pattern of independent nodes by simple terms.p  pstrongBriefly, in the RWP modelstrongp  pEach node moves along a zigzag line from one waypoint to the next The waypoints are uniformly distributed over the given convex area, e.g. unit disk. At the start of each leg a random velocity is drawn from the velocity distribution  in the basic case the velocity is constant 1 Optionally, the nodes may have socalled thinking times when they reach each waypoint before continuing on the next leg, where durations are independent and identically distributed random variablesp  pstrong[1. Common Problems with Random Waypoint Model][1]strongp  pZigzag trajectories RWP model is elementary and it is easy to argue about the paths being unnatural. Then again, any practical protocol or mechanism should be robust and give a reasonable performance with a wide range of moving patterns, including movement similar to RWP model. Velocity distribution The most common problem with simulation studies using random waypoint model is a poor choice of velocity distribution [4], e.g., uniform distribution U0,Vmax. Such velocity distributions which seem to be common with NS2 simulations lead to a situation where at the stationary state each node stops moving. In order to avoid this the velocity distribution should be such that 1E[1V]  0 Note that the mean time a node spends on a single leg is proportional to 1E[1V]. 2. Random Waypoint on the Border RWPBp  pIn the standard RWP model the waypoints are uniformly distributed over the given domain. Alternatively, the waypoints can be uniformly distributed on the border of the domain and this model is referred to as the Random waypoint on the border RWPB model. The spatial node density resulting from RWPB model is quite different from the RWP model, i.e. the probability mass shifts from the center of the area to the borders. In particular, if the border contains a straight line segment, then there is a positive probability that a random leg resides on the line segment resulting in a 1dimension pdf on each line segment on the border.p  p[1] a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comVKobC.gif relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comVKobC.gifa [sourcehttpwww.netlab.tkk.fiesajavarwprwpmodel.shtml]p  pThis is what I found a good source.

Negative 4985 pI have a spark borderContainer that contains a spark TextInput. I have an mousedown and mouseup event handlers on the borderContainer in order to drag it around the screen while dragging I change the cursor.p  pI would like to make the textInput behave as a standard textInput, i.e. when clicking on the textInput the user should not be able to drag the whole component but simply interact with text as heshe would normally. Also, Id like the textInput cursor to look like a normal textInput cursor. p  pIm not sure Im doing this right. My assumption is that I need to stop the propagation of mousedown and mouseup on the textInput to inhibit the drag behavior from its parent, and manage rollOver and rollOut in order for the cursor to look ok. See below an example of my code to simplify it there is no borderContainer or drag  but the code for that would be very simple  just a bit longer. p  pSo heres the issue if one clicks on the spark textInput and then rolls out of it the cursor turns into a combination of a textInput cursor  the standard cursor set for for the borderContainer. This doesnt seem to happen on mx textInput components thus the two boxes, but unfortunately I need to use spark components. My guess is that Im either not calling the cursorManager correctly or Im not stopping the propagation of mouseup properly  it seems like it should hit the textInput but not propagate to the borderContainer.

Negative 4985 pMy customer needs a more organized inventory of all 3rdparty libraries such as JAR files that are used in production for their projects. I am involved with a number of their Javabased projects. Their inventory has not been consistently maintained in the past and the time has come to account for all the libraries that are currently being used there are quite a few and to enforce a structured process for introducing new libraries into the build environment.  p  pI have tried pitching the idea of using Maven and Artifactory in their build process to leverage those tools ability to manage a repository of binary libraries and handle transitive library dependencies. The customer is resistent to the suggestion because they think it will create more work for them to maintain an Artifactory server and learn the basics of Maven.  p  pCurrently, their Java projects are all built using Ant scripts. Transitive dependencies are largely managed by trialanderror. The inventory of libraries currently in use is maintained by hand and the binaries are stored in a Subversion repository. The customer recognizes that this needs to be improved, but the current suggestions for improvement involve more adhoc manage it by hand approaches.  p  pstrongI want to convince the customer that a combination of Maven and Artifactory is a viable offtheshelf solution for their Java library management needs. Can anyone direct me to literaturematerials that I can use to create a presentation for my customer on the features and strengths of Maven and Artifactorystrongp  pAny other argumentssuggestionsetc that would assist me in this would also be appreciated.p

So this means I have to add annotations to specify the special permissions levels for the variables and other programming constructs in Scala.

I still have to check how this languages add their security extensions. p  pI talked to my advisor and he suggested three possibilities how I can implement this feature in Scalap  ol lisourcetosource compiler I dont think this is the best solution to write the things from the scratch because I will be busy with the parser and semantic and out of own experience I know that I dont have quite enough time to work on the main stuffli litypechecker plugin I havent wrote a plugin for compiler and think this just wont work on further versions of Scala because the compiler is still under developmentli libuild a library in Scala syntax are here simply free, so I can easily build something like this in a language I want  think this is like inventing a DSL and I believe that this is the best solutionli ol  pIf you have another idea how to implement please let me know and if you have pros and cons for the methods mentioned above please let me know.

Negative 4985 pI have a pipeline that I currently run on a large university computer cluster.  For publication purposes Id like to convert it into mapreduce format such that it could be run by anyone on using a hadoop cluster such as amazon webservices AWS.  The pipeline currently consists of as series of python scripts that wrap different binary executables and manage the input and output using the python subprocess and tempfile modules.  Unfortunately I didnt write the binary executables and many of them either dont take STDIN or dont emit STDOUT in a useable fashion e.g., only sent it to files.  These problems are why Ive wrapped most of them in python.p  pSo far Ive been able to modify my Python code such that I have a mapper and a reducer that I can run on my local machine in the standard test format.p  precode cat data.txt  mapper.py  reducer.py codepre  pThe mapper formats each line of data the way the binary it wraps wants it, sends the text to the binary using subprocess.popen this also allows me to mask a lot of spurious STDOUT, then collects the STOUT I want, and formats it into lines of text appropriate for the reducer. The problems arise when I try to replicate the command on a local hadoop install.

Im interested in the situation where the host kernel is Linux and its configured to prevent overcommit which it does by detailed accounting for all committed memory.p  pIf I just want to prevent the data that my application is no longer using from occupying physical memory or getting swapped to disk wasting resources either way, I can codemadvisecode the kernel that its unneeded, or codemmapcode new zero pages over top of it. But neither of these approaches will necessarily reduce the amount of memory that counts as committed, which other processes are then prevented from using.p  pWhat if I replace the pages with fresh zero pages that are marked readonly My intent is that they dont count towards committed memory, and further that I can later use codemprotectcode to make them writable, and that it would fail if making them writable would go over the committed memory limit.

Negative 4985 pFor testing and development purposes, it would be nice to somehow simulate spurious file access errors to emlocalem files.

Negative 4985 pIm writing an Android application that would like to verify that a string produced by a C program is authentic i.e. produced by another application that Ive written. To do that, Im signing the string and transmitting the string and the hash of the string to the Android device. I can include the public key used to create the hashed string in the Android application so I dont have to transmit it. The C code that produces all of that is akin to what followsp  precodebytes  ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytessomeString provider  new RSACryptoServiceProvider  signature  provider.SignDatabytes, new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider      keyParameters  cryptoProvider.ExportParametersfalse codepre  pTo transmit the data, I encode the signature as base64 usingp  psignatureString  System.Convert.ToBase64Stringsignaturep  pI manually extracted the modulus and the public exponent from the key Parameters. They appear to both be Base64 encoded already. In the android application Im attempting to verify the signature as followsp  precodeString modulus  ltmodulus string here...gt String exponent  ltexponent string here...gt  BigInteger BIModulus  new BigInteger1, Base64.decodemodulus BigInteger BIExponent  new BigInteger1, Base64.decodeexponent  RSAPublicKeySpec publicKeySpec  new RSAPublicKeySpecBIModulus, BIExponent PublicKey publicKey  KeyFactory.getInstanceRSA.generatePublicpublicKeySpec  Cipher cipher  Cipher.getInstanceRSA cipher.initCipher.DECRYPTMODE, publicKey  byte[] decodedBytes  cipher.doFinalBase64.decodesignature codepre  pWhen I compare codedecodedBytescode to the SHA1 hash of the original string, theyre different. Trying to figure out why, I stepped through the process with oodles of logging statements. It appears that the BigInteger for the modulus is different from the modulus used by the C code. The same happens with the exponent. My suspicion is that this is because Javas byte type is unsignedp  pSo, two questionsp  p1 What am I doing or not doing wrong Is there a way to manually move the modulus and exponent from one device to another to verify a signaturep  p2 Is there a way to accomplish what Im aiming for that works at a more appropriate level of abstractionp
Negative 4985 pToday, I was checking source code of the CRT library of Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 and I found a bug into the file mtdll.h. The problem is with the macro FLSGETVALUE. On x86 systems, this macro call directly TlsGetValue instead of making a call to the function assigned to the variable gpFlsGetValue. p  pFirst of all, its a problem because FlsAlloc, FlsGetValue, FlsFree and FlsSetValue are not available on all system Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003. These functions behave like TlsAlloc, TlsGetValue, TlsFree and TlsSetValue but support Fiberskind of user thread. Because we should prefer using Fls functions instead of Tls functions, the C runtime library of VS check if the Fls functions are availables when the process or the dll is loaded and initialise the gpFls variables. If the Fls are not available, the CRT initialise these variables with the equivalent Tls functions.p  pYou cannot use the macro FLSGETVALUE directly into your code because its used internally by the runtime library. The runtime use this macro to initialise per thread data of the runtime library.p  pMy question is about the impact of this bug. I know that fiber are not widely used, but if you develop a DLL that is used inside an application that use fiber, what can be the impact Does this bug can cause a crash of the application or only produce false results Does this problem can cause problem with widely used application like SQL Server What do you think Does this bug can be a security risk Does IIS or ASP.Net use fiber that can cause a crash p  pFor curious people, here the current source of the problematic line in mtdll.hp  pcodedefine FLSGETVALUE    PFLSGETVALUEFUNCTIONTlsGetValuegetvalueindexcodep  pHere a fixed version of the macro FLSGETVALUE p  pcodedefine FLSGETVALUE    PFLSGETVALUEFUNCTIONDecodePointergpFlsGetValuegetvalueindexcodep  pFor now, I should find how to submit a bug to Microsoft.p

Negative 4985 pThere is a large existing code base for a complex app that is written in C using MFC and WinAPI which needs to be ported to Mac OS X.  The ideal solution is to have as much code common between the different platforms, especially code such as business logic. The GUI might be different depending on how good tools are available for a cross platform GUI. There are some low level OS calls which will be different on different platforms. The major goal is not to end up with two separate versions of the software that need to be developed and maintained separately.p  pI have been looking at Qt but I would be curious to know what other alternatives are there, and how people have solved this problem in the past.p  ul liIf you were to port an existing app written in MFC what would you use  how would you do itli liIf you could start the project from scratch on both platforms, what would you use  how would you do itli ul

It boiled down to thisp  precodeMe.prvcomObject.Value  aValuePassedIn  This throws the error that the                                           Property Value could not be found    This works instead  Me.prvcomObject.setValueaValuePassedIn codepre  pNow comes the clue, this only breaks in codex86code configuration, in codeAny CPUcode I can still use the Properties. I was also unable to reproduce this with SharpDevelop, SD is always expecting Properties.

Negative 4985 pI am reading Jeffrey Richters CLR via C, and in it he says with ref parameters the reference itself is passed by value. This makes sense to me and seems analagous to pointers.p  pi.e. in C if I pass a pointer into a function and then assign the pointer via malloc it changes the pointer to point to the new memory location, however I know since the pointer itself is a copy it doesnt reassign the original pointer that was passed into the function. In order to accomplish change to the pointer outside the function I have to use a double pointer.p  pHowever, in Cp  precodevoid Swapref Object a, ref Object b      Object t  b     b  a     a t   codepre  pworks. This indicates to me that references arent by value. In analogy to the malloc above, I am assuming I could pass an object by reference and assign it a new object and the reassignment would persist outside the function. p  pCan someone clearup my confusionp

I understand the error, however I would like to know if there is a way to strongly type a property that has an interfacep  pOne way around this is to not have the interface IMyInterfaceA define a property of interface IMyInterfaceB at all and extent on the pocos, however I am trying to enforce the property is implemented using interfaces.p  pThe main reason I need to strongly type the properties of the poco is because I am using JSON to desterilize over the wire.p  pThank you for any guidance.p

Negative 4985 pIm working with an iOS app that has an animation of a spinning body. A series of UIImages are stored in an NSArray and a variable keeps track on the index to the current image.p  pThe following method updates the UIImageViewp  precode voidrenewImage     [rotatingBody.image release]     rotatingBody.image  [[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile[currentPerson.imageArray objectAtIndexpictureIndex]]  codepre  pUp until now i have called the method as a response to touch events. From the touch event I calculate a new pictureIndex and then call [self renewImage]. It works perfectly.p  pHowever, now I want to add momentum to the animation. Instead of calculating the next image right away I calculate a velocity. Im planning to have a loop in a separate thread to update pictureIndex by using the velocity variable, decrease the velocity and eventually call [self renewImage].p  pENTER THE PROBLEMp  pWhenever I call [self renewImage] more then once in a row in the same function e.g. in a loop or just twice separated by some sort of sleep the screen wont update until after the last call. It is as if the device or compilator rationalizes away the first updates even though Im certain that the renewImage method has been visited thanks to tracing.p  pHere is some test code that doesnt workp  precodewhile velocity gt 0          pictureIndex         pictureIndex  pictureIndex  [self getNumberOfImages]         if pictureIndex lt 0                      pictureIndex  [self getNumberOfImages]                  velocity  20         NSLogvelocity f, velocity         [self renewImage]         [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval0.5]      codepre  pNeither does thisp  precodepictureIndex  20 [self renewImage] sleep1 pictureIndex  20 [self renewImage] codepre  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 4985 pI have a lot of configuration files that modify how my application behaves.  I want to be able to make a change and it gets reflected in the application right away when saving the file.  Is there a Java library to help with thisp  pI could simply keep a list of files with their timestamps and continuously check in a background thread when a timestamp changes.  Doesnt seem too difficult, but maybe theres a more efficient way to do this  Custom triggers when certain properties have changed would be nice.p  pIm using Spring 3.1, is there a builtin mechanism or solution which works nicely with Springp  pstrongemUPDATEemstrong Apparently JDK7 now includes this functionality through its a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialionotification.htmlWatch Service APIa Most file system implementations have native support for file change notification. The Watch Service API takes advantage of this support where available. However, when a file system does not support this mechanism, the Watch Service will poll the file system, waiting for events.  So thisll be my motivation to migrate to JDK7.p

Negative 4985 pAre there any, free, tools which allow incremental static analysis of code for SVN and preferably Git Currently we are using Sonar 2.12 I think but the problem is the time it needs to analyse all the code in our project which is 4060minutes.

This was very convenient as we knew who was at fault based on the info from the commit. Or should we instead analyse it less frequently lets say once a week In that case I would have to check if Sonar would be able to say who committed the problematic code.p

But, if that is the absolute only answer, I guess that may be what I have to do...some day...p

Negative 4985 pIm warming up with Clojure and started to write a few simple functions.p  pIm realizing how the language is clearly wellsuited for parallel computation and this got me thinking.

Negative 4985 pIm working on bindings to a web service, where some of the calls take flags to return additional information. For example, getting an artist via ID can take the recordings flag to return recordings of an artist, and getting a release by ID can also take the recordings flag to get all recordings of tracks on that release. However, when getting an artist you can get all releases by that artist, but this flag is not valid when you actually get a specific release.p  pSo to encode that into the Haskell, the following should be a valid programp  precodegetArtistById 5678 [ WithRecordings ] getReleaseById 37837 [ WithRecordings ] codepre  pAnd the following should be an invalid program, and fail to buildp  precodegetReleaseById 739 [ WithReleases ] codepre  hr  pIve thought of a few solutions, but Im not sure which I should take. The first idea that came to mind was to use type classes codeArtistFlagcode and codeReleaseFlagcode, but this doesnt make sense for a few reasons. Firstly, codeArtistFlag f gt [f]code means a list of the same flag, which is flawed. But also, the type class would imply the ability to add extra flags  in the future, which also does not make much sense  there are a finite number of flags.p  pMy next option was separate data declarations for each end points flagsp  precodedata ArtistFlag  ArtistWithRecordings  ArtistWithReleases data ReleaseFlag  ReleaseWithRecordings codepre  pThis is kinda clunky to work with  ideally codeWithRecordingscode should always have the same name, to simplify the API for the programmer.p  pFinally, and this is the only option I havent explored due to lack of knowledge, this might be solvable by HList. getArtistById should take a heterogeneous set of artist flags. I dont know how to express this in HList yet though, or even if it can do this.p  pWould love to hear what typing gurus have to say p  pThe actual part of the API Im implementing is at a hrefhttpmusicbrainz.orgdocXMLWebServiceVersion2Subqueries relnofollowhttpmusicbrainz.orgdocXMLWebServiceVersion2Subqueriesa  notice the coderecordingscode flag, etc.p
Negative 4985 pWorking in Drupal 6, PHP 5.3, and MySQL, Im building a query that looks roughly like thisp  precodeSELECT val from table [and some other tables joined in below]     where [a bunch of clauses, including getting all the tables joined up]         and foo not in select ...         and bar in select... and x  y              or baz in select ... and p  q codepre  pThats not a great representation of what Im trying to do, but hopefully it will be enough.  The point is that, in the middle of the query there is an embedded SELECT that is used a number of times.  Its always the same.  Its not completely selfcontained  it relies on a value pulled from one of the tables at the top level of the query.p  pIm feeling a little guiltyunclean for just repeating the query every time its needed, but I dont see any other way to compute the value once and reuse it as needed. Since it refers to the value from a top level table, I cant compute it once outside the query and just insert the value into the query, either through a MySQL variable or by monkeying around with the query string. Or, so I think, anyway.p  pIs there anything I can do about this  Or, maybe its a nonissue from a performance perspective the code might be nasty, but parhaps MySQL is smart enough to cache the value itself and avoid executing the query over and over again  Any advice  Thanksp

Negative 4985 pI have a couple of questions around exception management for a websitep  ul lipin the catch block can I have a static class with a handle exception method that handles the exception like sop  precode   catch Exception ex              throw ExceptionHandler.HandleException...      codepre  pwhere ExceptionHandler.HandleException is a static method that returns a variable of type System.Exception. Is this a good practice Any possible problems with this approach Will it be thread safepli lipIn my application I have a DAL layer that is called by the Business layer and the Business layer is called by the UI. So, is it a good practice to just rethrow all Custom  exceptions so they bubble up right up to the UI where they get displayed whereas System.Exception types get logged and I throw a custom exception in the catch block for eg in DAL and Business Layer like sop  precode    catch CustomExceptionBase ex              throw          catch Exception sysEx              ICustomExceptionBase ex  new SysExceptionsysEx         ex.Handle         throw BusinessExceptionSome problem while serving your request      codepre  pIn the UI layer like sop  precode    catch CustomExceptionBase ex              when custom exception bubbles up code to display text to user on screen          catch Exception sysEx              ICustomExceptionBase ex  new SysExceptionsysEx         ex.Handle         display error on screen      codepre  pHere CustomExceptionBase implements ICustomExceptionBase and inherits Exception.

For all custom exceptions in the DAL layer or Business layer, I just bubble it up all the way to the UI where the text gets displayed.p

From what I saw theres not much WYSIWYG built into VS2010. p  pHow about Microsoft Expression Studio or other MS tools. Do any of those offer things that would help me out. All I need is a tool that will help me with placing my DIVs and my images in the right places. p  pPlease dont remove or lock this question. Its a real question and I am NOT just asking for subjective opinions on which is better. I would like to know what Microsoft Products are out there and what people use.p

Negative 4985 pIm working on a college project to allow a user select a csv file via a file chooser in a GUI and then display a checkbox for each column of the file.p  pI have the back end code written to handle any number of columns but the problem Im having is displaying the checkboxes. The way I approached this was to put the file chooser in one panel and the checkboxes in a second with the intention of adding the second panel, setting it visible, from a actionListener method, once the file had been read.p  pHowever without the array of checkbox names filled when the GUI is first setup Im unable to display the checkboxes.p  pIve since tried using both tabbed layout a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswingcomponentstabbedpane.html relnofollowtabbed layouta and a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswinglayoutcard.html relnofollowcard layouta and read up on wizard layout, but from what ive seen, these all had their components initalised and the action listeners were simply setting them visibleinvisiblep  pAt this stage Im beginning to wonder is it even possible to do this in a single gui or how could I approach the problem with two GUIs.p  pIve only been using java for 3months and any pointers in the right direction would be a huge help,  Thanksp

Negative 4985 pThe latest version of the excellent Guava library has updated the caching apis.  CacheBuilder now has a maxmimumWeight method to enforce a maximum weight over the cache.  The javadoc statesp  blockquote   pSpecifies the maximum weight of entries the cache may contain. Weight   is determined using the Weigher specified with weigher, and use of   this method requires a corresponding call to weigher prior to calling   buildcom.google.common.cache.CacheLoader.p      pNote that the cache may evict an entry before this limit is exceeded.   As the cache size grows close to the maximum, the cache evicts entries   that are less likely to be used again. For example, the cache may   evict an entry because it hasnt been used recently or very often.p blockquote  pWhen the Cache needs to evict an entry, will it consider the weights  For example, it may be better to keep several entries of small weight than one entry of large weight, if the large weight entry is used more often than any small item, but less often than all of the small items together.p

Negative 4985 pI have an OSX application written in ObjectiveCCocoa using xcode. The application is quite finished, tested and sold on the App Store. p  pI havent worked on this application for some time and recently, I rebuilt it using xcode 4.3.3 on my OSX 10.7.4 and I noticed that while it builds just fine, there are some very strange visual glitches when running the application that were never seen before and occasionally, I get EXCBADACCESS when closing the application. All these seem to be related to the PDFKit framework I am using. I am unable to debug these problems since the glitches are just visual nothing I can check in code and EXCBADACCESS exception comes from internally allocated objects not related to my code.p  pThe code itself havent changed, I tried previous revisions of the code and they all exhibit the same strange behavior now. I tried running an old binary I have of the application compiled couple of months ago and it works just fine. Then I tried building it with previous versions of xcode, down to 4.2.1 which I know was ok when I submitted the app to the app store and the problems still occur.p  pThen I suspected this may be something specific to my environment so I built the project on different machine also with xcode 4.3.2 and OSX 10.7.4. Same results, the problems are still there.p  pSo now I suspect that it has something to do with the OSX 10.7.4 update since this is the last thing that was changed between now and when I was able to produce a good build of the application. I am pretty puzzled to what to do next and how to identify the cause of this problem. I have an old binary that is working fine and I have a newly compiled binary of the same code revision that has problems. p  pIs there any useful information I can get from the difference of these binaries What can I do to determine the cause of these problems What can I try nextp  pThanksp  pNOTE update I stated it above but I want to make sure it is clear. This is a Mac OSX Cocoa application, not iOS.p

Negative 4985 pI am trying to use codewaitpidcode for waiting for individual threads instead of processes. I know that codepthreadjoincode or codestdthreadjoincode are the typical ways for waiting for a thread. In my case, however, I am developing a monitoring application that forks and executes via codeexecvcode a program which in turn, spawns some threads. So, I cannot join the threads from the monitoring application, since they belong to a different process and I do not have access to the source code. Still, I want to be able to wait for these individual threads to finish.p  pFor an easier visualization of what I am trying to achieve, I include a drawing, hoping to make it much more clearp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFa4dS.png altenter image description herep  pEveryhing works fine when I use processes, but codewaitpidcode does not wait for threads. Basically, codewaitpidcode returns code1code right after it is called the thread is still running at that time for some more seconds.p  pDocumentation for codewaitpidcode statesp  blockquote   pIn the Linux kernel, a kernelscheduled thread is not a distinct construct from a process. Instead, a thread is simply a process that is created using the Linuxunique clone2 system call other routines such as the portable pthreadcreate3 call are implemented using clone2. Before Linux 2.4, a thread was just a special case of a process, and as a consequence one thread could not wait on the children of another thread, even when the latter belongs to the same thread group. However, POSIX prescribes such functionality, and since Linux 2.4 a thread can, and by default will, wait on children of other threads in the same thread group.p blockquote  pThat description only considers waiting from a thread to children of other threads in my case I want to wait for threads children of another process. But, at least, it shows that codewaitpidcode is threadaware. p  pThis is what I am using for waiting for the threadsp  precodestdvectorltpidtgt pids   fill vector with thread IDs LWP IDs   for pidt pid  pids      int status     pidt res  waitpidpid, ampstatus, WALL     stdcout ltlt waitpid rc  ltlt res ltlt stdendl  codepre  pThis code works for waiting for processes, but it fails for waiting for threads even if codeWALLcode flag is used.p  pI am wondering whether it is actually possible to wait for a thread by using codewaitpidcode.

If I try this monitoring tool with multithreaded C applications, everything works fine. But the original intent was to use this monitoring tool with a Java application spawning several threads. When using a multithreaded Java application the codewaitpidcode in the loop wakes up many times per second the child thread is stopped by a SIGSEGV signal. This seems to be related to the fact that Java is using SIGSEGV for its own purposes see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3731784alotofsigsegvwhilestraceingjavaprocessthis questiona, and a hrefhttpfusionsecurity.blogspot.com.es201110whyamiseeingsigsegvwhenistrace.html relnofollowthis posta. p  pAll those wakeups end up slowing down the application a lot.

There will be two more methods in the Student class as shown below.p      ul   ligetCourseNumbers it returns a list of course numbers that the student has taken. It returns an empty list if the student has not taken any courses.li   ligetGradecourseno it returns the grade the student has received in the course identified by the parameter courseno. If the given course number is not found, this function returns Z to indicate that.li   liaddCoursecourseno, grade adds a course with the course number and gradeli   liupdateCoursecourseno, grade updates an existing courses gradeli   lideleteCoursecourseno deletes the course from the dictionary.li   ul blockquote  pHere is my code thus farp  precodeclass Course     def init self, crn, ch, ins         self.crn  crn         self.ch  ch         self.ins  ins      def coursenameself         return self.crn      def credithourself         return self.ch      def instructorself         return self.ins  class Student     def initself, id, sfirst, slast         self.sid  sid         self.sfirst  sfirst         self.slast  slast      def studentidself         return self.sid      def studentfirstself         return self.sfirst      def studentlastself         return self.slast  def main      course  CourseCSC 1100, 4, Name      print course.coursename     print course.credithour     print course.instructor  main       codepre  pSo, my question really is.

Negative 4985 pIm in the process of migrating some of our legacy Watir scripts over to WatirWebdriver. The migration has gone mostly well except for how they designed WatirWebdriver to handle popup windows. Rather than using the triedandtrue Attach method, they have replaced it with a simplified Window method. The syntax is quite simple, however I am having a difficult time understand how to close a separate child window without closing the parent window. Currently my code is something like this p  precode  b.buttonxpath gt PREVIEWBUTTON.click   b.windowtitle, POPUPWINDOW.use DO     b.close   end codepre  pCurrently what is happening is that the b.close method is closing both the child window and parent window. Im not sure why this is happening since the b.close method is contained in the DO block. I need to verify that the PREVIEWBUTTON indeed creates a child window, but I need the parent window to stay open.p

This feels wrong.p  pI think the decorator implementation is correct but now i am stuck with this other problemp  pHow can i resolve thisp  pThe client class might not need both decoratorFunctionA and decoratorFunctionB called, it might only need 1 or none so I cant simply call these automatically in the doYourThing call.p  pA possibility is to have an interface for MyAceBaseClassDecoratorA but then i am kind of defeating the purpose of using the decorator in the first place.p

Negative 4985 pIm currently testing some IoC frameworks for a project, and Id love to be able to use Ninject 3.  p  pIm running into an issue where after I configure a binding to a concretely typed singleton, I cant seem to effectively unbind the service type later on.  That is, codeStandardKernel.TryGetltTgtcode returns a nonnull value after calling codeStandardKernel.UnbindltTgtcode.  See the snippet below for my exact usage.p  pIs this a bug in Ninject 3, or is there something Im missing  p  pAs a workaround, I can simply rebind the concrete type to a constant null value.  But Id prefer to understand if Im not grokking something before I fallback to that position.p  pBy the way, unbinding works as expected if I specify an interface bound to a concrete type in singleton scope, but not for a self bound concrete type in singleton scope.  If this is not a bug and for extra karma can you explain why there is a difference in behaviourp  precodepublic class MyServiceType  IDisposable      public bool IsDisposed  get private set      public void Dispose              IsDisposed  true        static void Mainstring[] args      var kernel  new StandardKernel      kernel.BindltMyServiceTypegt.ToSelf.InSingletonScope      var instance  kernel.TryGetltMyServiceTypegt     Debug.Assertinstance  null ampamp instance.IsDisposed       release the instance     kernel.Releaseinstance     Debug.Assertinstance.IsDisposed     instance  null       unbind the service     kernel.UnbindltMyServiceTypegt       uncomment below for workaround      kernel.RebindltMyServiceTypegt.ToConstantMyServiceTypenull        after unbinding should no longer be able to get an instance of the service     instance  kernel.TryGetltMyServiceTypegt     Debug.Assertinstance  null   lt this is failing  codepre

Note C does not support defaultint on line 15. syntax error  missing  before identifier end on line 16. missing type specifier  int assumed. Note C does not support defaultint on line 16.p  pBut changing codevectorltTgtconstiteratorcode into codevectorconstiteratorcode doesnt seem like the way to go. Also changing it to auto does not work. This gives me expected a trailing return type. If I delete line 15,16 and 17 and replace A.begin with A.data.begin and the next two arguments accoringly, everything is fine. But why doesnt my original code work, and how can I get it to workp

Negative 4985 pSo i need some directions. I want to understand Cloud Software as a ServiceSaaS practical initialization. The thing is I want to create a simple cloud service which would let me run programs on this cloud from remote machine. As I understand, I need some kind of specific backbone project to start this system, similar like OpenStack or Apache Cloud for Infostructure as a Service. Of course it may be that I understand it completely wrong and even if there is such project, it is not open source, free. I could also comprehend SaaS building on IaaS, but the thing is, I cant find any practical information at all. Could Somebody indulge me if there is any kind of free licence SaaS project or recommend a related articles or explain everything in a nut case with atleast vague direction.  p

Negative 4985 pLets say I have repository for a project that has a bunch of folders and files lets call it master.p  ul li3rdPartyJarsli licompassli lijsli lideployli lijsli lipythonli libuild.xmlli ul  pWhen I deploy to the production server I just want to push the latest deploy and python folders to the server.  Previously I was using svn1.7 and I just created a deploy repository that when a deploy would happen I would just drop the latest folders in and commit to the deploy repository and do an update from the server.p  pI think a better approach would be to have a deploy branch created from master which only has the two folders.  When deploy would be needed the only a sync from master would need to be done.  Is there a way to do this with branching in git or another vcs  Keep in mind I am still very new to git and I have only used it in my free time for about a couple of weeks now.  p

Negative 4985 pIve been trying to do something supposedly simple, but as usual, its not working for me, in dubious circumstances. What I want to do is simply load a bitmap to the screen and keep it there. The popup window will have no controls, cannot be moved, and will only handle WMPAINT through its pump like a splash screen.p  pThe code compiles fine and runs fine during debug mode, but when I switch to release mode  codeLoadImagecode invariably returns codeNULLcode and everything else fails as a result. This is my fourth hour spent on this one method and I think its time to ask for help. I have checked for uninitialized memory and can ensure that every class member used is initialized to code0code, and am reasonably sure that this is not the problem. Ill post the code below, and thanks a lot for your help.p  pId prefer to only do this using WinAPI, if possible, because I wont have a use for this functionality anywhere else in this application.

Negative 4985 pIm implementing COM automation dual interface for an application. The automation interface will be called from VBScript. Im not quite clear on what types are allowed for the methods arguments. I do know that basically values have to fit in a codeVARIANTcode, but does that mean every parameter of type codeintcode must be passed through a codeVARIANTcode, or can one pass codeintcode directlyp  pFor example, two methods I have in my MIDL file arep  precodeHRESULT SetDate[in] int Year, [in] int Month, [in] int Day HRESULT GetDate[out] int pYear, [out] int pMonth, [out] int pDay codepre  pCalling codeSetDatecode from VBScript works. Calling codeGetDatecode as shown fails, which is to say that in the implementation, which is in C, codeITypeInfoInvokecode returns a code indicating a type error.p  pI observe that if a use VARIANT instead of int, as shown below, it works.p  precodeHRESULT GetDate[out] VARIANT pYear, [out] VARIANT pMonth, [out] VARIANT pDay codepre  pSo is codeintcode not allowed for parameters because of the dual interface, or must I be doing something else wrong If codeintcode is not allowed, why does codeSetDatecode work  is there a difference between in and out parameters in this respectp  pFurthermore, this pair of methods works, although both use codeintcodep  precode[propget] HRESULT System[out, retval] int pSystem [propput] HRESULT System[in] int System codepre  pHow come  are the rules for the allowed parameter types different for a property, or when the parameter is declared as coderetvalcodep  pI cant quite make sense of it all  would be grateful if anyone can clarify this.p

Negative 4985 pHeres the thing, we want to be able to cache our partialstemplates, using http headers.p  pAfter some thought we ended up with wanting to put our templates to the initially loaded html using the codescriptcode directive.p  pWhich would work just fine, as long as the url will use the hashcodeindex.htmlsomething123code. Since codeindex.htmlcode would be cached no matter what I put after the hash.p  pNow what if I want to use the html5mode Since the url is the key for caching codeindexsomething123code and codeindexsomething321code wouldnt be loaded from the cache, even though itd still be the same codeindex.htmlcode.. am I making any sense so farp  pHow can html5mode and http caching work along Other than putting all the templates to a separated filep  p..a little extra question, one of the reasons we wanted to use the script directive and not load the partials in a separated request because the only way I came up withto load all the partials, would be to load them in say json file with keyval, then run thru it and code.putcode them in the codetemplateCachecode, which is far from ideal. Is there a way to say load a file full of codescriptcode directives I cant really imagine how fast would this be, since itd have to treat it as dom nodes and iterate over them to save it to the codetemplateCachecode, which I think would be easier to work with, but even slower than the json approach..p  pThanksp

Negative 4985 pstrongProblem in a nutshellstrongp  pI have been building an IOS application in recent weeks and have run into some trouble.The application is plays an animation by manipulating and then drawing an image raster multiple times per second. The image is drawn by assigning it to a codeUIViewscode codeCALayercode like so codeself.layer.contents  idpimage.CGImagecode The calculation and rendering are seperated in two codeCADisplayLinkcodes. p  pThis animation technique achieves a satisfactory performance on the IPhone 6.1 simulator but when it is build on the physical device Iphone 4s running IOS 6.1.3 it experiences a significant slow down. The slow down is so bad that it actually makes the application unusable.   p  pstrongSuspected Issuesstrongp  pI have read, in this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11659163differenceofmemoryorganizationbetweeniosdeviceandiphonesimulatorDifference of memory organization between iOS device and iPhone simulatora , that the simulator is allowed to use far more memory than the actual device. However, while observing my apps memory usage in in instruments, I noticed that the total memory usage never exceeds 3Mbs. So Im unsure if that is actually the problem but its probably worth pointing out. p  pAccording to this question, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5172775doestheiossimulatorusemultiplecoresDoes the iOSSimulator use multiple coresa , the IOS simulator runs of an intel chip while actual my device uses an apple A5 chip. I suspect that this may also be the cause of the slowdown. p  pI am considering rewriting the animation in Open GL, however Id first like to try and improve the existing code before I take any drastic steps. p  pAny help in identifying what the problem is would be greatly appreciated. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThanks to all those who offered suggestions.  I discovered while profiling that the main bottleneck was actually clearing the image raster for the next animation. I decided to rewrite the rendering of the animations in opengl. It didnt take as long as anticipated. The app now achieves a pretty good level of performance and is a little bit simpler.p

Negative 4985 pIm a little confused on referencing functions from classes outside of the one referencing it. I always thought that if a function is a public function, I could just go ahead and run it from another class. For example...p  pIm trying to run an audio slider bar in my new game. The music comes on just fine when I begin the game. Unfortunately, my gameScreen class subclasses the document class. This means that my audio clip is currently not added to the stage until I begin the game. I want the user to be able to turn the sound off BEFORE playing the game though yes, even though its not yet playing, I figure this is a good practice to get into. This means, if they go directly to the options screen, I need my audio slider to be there Right now, it is only added to the stage if I begin playing though. p  pMy plan to fix this was to go into my options screen class and then if the options screen function is run, it adds the audio clip to the stage. That means I have to run an eventlistener. In this eventlistener, I wanted to reference a function from my codeVolumecode class....basically codeaddToStagecode. I already have that in my codeVolumecode class and I thought that it is probably a waste of time to get in the habit of copying functions from one class to another when its already there. So I thought, hey, lets just go to that function since its a public functionp  pTurns out I get an error undefined property addToStage.p  pSo what can I do to make it so I dont have to recopy this function straight into my optionScreen class Thanks, and Ill provide some code belowp  precodepackage           import flash.display.Sprite         import flash.display.Graphics         import flash.events.MouseEvent         import flash.events.Event         import flash.net.URLRequest         import flash.media.Sound         import flash.media.SoundChannel         import flash.media.SoundTransform         import flash.geom.Rectangle          public class Volume extends Sprite                   public var sndSound  new Sound                 public var channelSoundChannel  new SoundChannel                 URLRequestnew URLRequestsolitude.wav                 Make sure you pass URLRequest an audio file on your computer.                 public var reqBackgroundMusic  new BackgroundMusic                 public var boundaryRectangle                 public var spriteSprite                 public var sliderSprite                 public var xPosNumber                 public var yPosNumber                 public var volNumber                                   Our request is loaded into the sound object and plays through                 our channel.

The init function is called.                                     public function Volume                          channelreq.play                         channel.addEventListener Event.SOUNDCOMPLETE, onBackgroundMusicFinished,false,0,true                          vol.5                         channel.soundTransformnew SoundTransformvol                                                     The init function creates and draws a rectangle and circle                 to the stage and centers them based on the height and                 width of the stage. In addition, a rectangle object is                 created to contain the sliding circle, like an imaginary box.                 We pass 100 as the x value because it is added relative                 to our sprite. If we set its x value at 0, or the sprites default x                 value,the boundary would stop and start at the slider sprite. Change                 100 to 0 in the rectangle object to get a better idea of its use.                                    public function onStageeEventvoid                                      We remove it immediately so that it doesnt get called multiple times                     As the instance is added to the display list tree                     this.removeEventListenerEvent.ADDEDTOSTAGE, onStage                      xPos  stage.stageWidth2                     yPos  stage.stageHeight2                       Now that we have a reference to the stage, lets go ahead and create our slider                      init                                   public function initvoid                          sprite  new Sprite                         sprite.graphics.beginFill0x999999                         sprite.graphics.drawRectxPos,yPos,200,5                         sprite.graphics.endFill                         addChildsprite                         sprite.xsprite.width2                         slider  new Sprite                         slider.graphics.beginFill0xFF0000                         slider.graphics.drawCirclexPos,yPos, 20                         slider.graphics.endFill                         addChildslider                         slider.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, dragSlider                         stage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP, stopSlider                         boundarynew Rectangle100,0,200,0                                                     dragSlider runs when the use holds the mouse button down. A                 startDrag method is used on our sprite where we specify boundary                 as our dragging limits. A new event handler designed                 to change the mouse volume is subsequenlty called per frame, where                 the slider.x property determines volume.                                    public function dragSlidereventMouseEventvoid                          slider.startDragfalse,boundary                         slider.removeEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, dragSlider                         slider.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, changeVolume                                                     Stops dragging and removes the event listener to save on space. Again,                 volume will be based on the sliders current x position, which is                 constantly being recalculated per frame because we used an                 ENTERFRAME event.                                    public function stopSlidereventMouseEventvoid                          slider.stopDrag                         slider.removeEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP, stopSlider                                                     This function is constantly recalculating the vol variable                 based on the sliders x position, relative to the length of                 our rectangle. Creates a decimal range from 0 to 1, where 1                 represents 100 volume and 0 represents mute. Anything exceeding                 100 causes distortion.                                    public function changeVolumeeventEventvoid                          vol.5Math.roundslider.x200                         channel.soundTransformnew SoundTransformvol                                   public function onBackgroundMusicFinishedeventEventvoid                                      channel  req.play                     channel.addEventListener Event.SOUNDCOMPLETE, onBackgroundMusicFinished                               codepre  pOptionScreen classp  precode   package    import flash.display.MovieClip import flash.display.SimpleButton import flash.events.MouseEvent import flash.text.TextField import flash.ui.Mouse import flash.net.SharedObject   public class OptionScreen extends MovieClip       public var mainMenuButtonSimpleButton     private var newVolumeVolume      public function OptionScreen           Mouse.show         newVolume  new Volume         newVolume.onStage             mainMenuButtonOptions.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, onClickMainMenu,false,0,true                   public function onClickMainMenumouseEventMouseEventvoid                      dispatchEvent new NavigationEventNavigationEvent.MAINMENU                 codepre

Negative 4985 pA typical recommendation for securing a REST API is to use HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL. My question is, should HTTP Basic Authentication only be used to authenticate the strongclientstrong ie. the app accessing the API, or can it also be used to authenticate the stronguserstrong the consumer of the appp  pIt seems most APIs have to deal with both, as almost all web services employ some sort of user accounts. Just consider Twitter or Vimeothere are public resources, and there are private user specific resources.p  pIt seems logical that a simple REST API could do both client and user authentication at the same time using using HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL.p  pIs this a good designp

Negative 4985 pOkay so here are my table schemas.br I have 2 tables. Say Table A and Table B. The primary key of Table A is PriKeyA bigint50 and primary key of Table B is PriKeyB varchar255. Both PriKeyA and PriKeyB contain the same type of data.br The relevant fields of Table A required for this problem are LastlogindateinA date and Table B is the primary key itself.br What I need to do is, get those PriKeyAs in A which are not there in Table Bs PriKeyB column and the LastlogindateinA column should be greater than 30 days from the current date. Basically I need the difference of Table A and Table B along with a certain conditionwhich is the date in this problembr Here is my SQL command  p  precode SELECT A.PriKeyA from A    LEFT JOIN B ON A.PriKeyA  B.PriKeyB     WHERE B.PriKeyB IS NULL and DATEDIFFCURRENTDATE,LastlogindateinAgt30 codepre  pHowever when I run this MySQL command, it takes about ridiculously long amount of time About 3 hours. The size of Table A is 2,50,000 and Table B is 42,000 records respectively. I thought that this problem could arise due to the fact that PriKeyA and PriKeyB are different datatypes. So i also used the codeCASTPriKeyB as unsignedcode in the query. But that too didnt work. There was a marginal performance improvement.  p  pWhat could be the possible problems Ive used Left Joins before and they never have taken this long.p

Negative 4985 peveryone, I am porting the WinPcap from NDIS6 protocol to NDIS6 filter. It is nearly finished, but I still have a bit of questionsp  pThe comment of ndislwf said A filter that doesnt provide a FilerSendNetBufferList handler can not originate a send on its own. Does it mean if I used the NdisFSendNetBufferLists function, I have to provide the FilerSendNetBufferList handler  My driver will send selfconstructed packets by NdisFSendNetBufferLists, but I dont want to filter other programs sent packets.p  pThe same as the FilterReturnNetBufferLists, it said A filter that doesnt provide a FilterReturnNetBufferLists handler cannot originate a receive indication on its own.. What does originate a receive indication mean NdisFIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists or NdisFReturnNetBufferLists or both Also, for my driver, I only want to capture received packets instead of the returned packets. So if possible, I dont want to provide the FilterReturnNetBufferLists function for performance purpose.p  pAnother ressembled case is FilterOidRequestComplete and NdisFOidRequest, in fact my filter driver only want to send Oid requests itself by NdisFOidRequest instead of filtering Oid requests sent by others. Can I leave the FilterOidRequest, FilterCancelOidRequest and FilterOidRequestComplete to NULL Or which one is a must to use NdisFOidRequestp  pThx.p

Negative 4985 pThis question is not about solving the issue, but rather about understanding the inner workings of the Python 2.7 compiler part.p  pSee the code below.

Negative 4985 pWhen packaging a javascript library that needs to be used with AMD, CommonJS or as a global, it is common to use a defition such as the followingp  precodefunctionname, definition      if typeof module  undefined module.exports  definition     else if typeof define  function ampamp typeof define.amd  object definedefinition     else this[name]  definition mod, function      Here goes the code you would normally have inside define or add to module.exports     return MyModule       codepre  pThis works well assuming your library consists of only a single file, with no external dependencies. I am not sure what to do when publishing a library that consists of various interdependent modules, possibly with external dependencies.p  pEven if I only want to support AMD AMD  Bower is my main use case, i.e. the way I will use the library myself, I am not sure which is the way to go. Assume my library publishes modules codefoocode and codebarcode, with codebarcode depending on codefoocode, both having codeexternalcode as a dependency. I could try to do something likep  precode mylibfoo.js define[external], functionexternal     whatever   mylibbar.js define[.foo, external], functionfoo, external     whatever  codepre  pStill, I am not guaranteed that a client of mine would resolve external correctly. For this to work, the client would need to explicitly add the path for codeexternalcode in its RequireJS definition. This is still doable, if there is just one dependency, but I would prefer to shield the client from having to know that the library uses external. This should be declared in my codebower.jsoncode and codepackage.jsoncode files, but the client should not mess with transitive dependencies manually.

However, if I reduce the row height somewhat, everything will be rendered correctly.p  pIs there some documentation pertaining to this problem Should codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode always return the precise row height based on contents For example, I just made the row heights rather large so I could always see the contents, but alas, codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode wouldnt be called as many times as it should, and general rendering problems ensued.p  pApologies for the fuzzy description, but perhaps those who have experienced the same problem could offer some insight.p  pCheers.p

Negative 4985 pIm a little bit disappointed about the fps of my game. I am still at the beginning of the development of the game. When I started my game first, I got around 350 fps. After I added a heightmap and some more code to the program, is it logical that the fps drop. Now I got 39 fps. Im still at the beginning and the fps is already low. I wonder what happens when I finish the project, I think the fps will be so low that its irritating. I know that Im asking very much of the program, the heightmap is the big problem. The map has an area of 200  200 vertices, each vertice has a height. 200  200  40000 vertices, each frame. I was thinking to simplify the map. My idea is to create a method which simplifies the whole heightmap. Each 4 vertices belong to a quad. When there are two or more quads next to each other which have the same height on each vertex, they can be merged to one quad. The point is that there should be less vertices. I thinkp  pI will show some example code of my heightmap.p  precodepackage rgc.area  import java.awt.Dimension import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  public class HeightMap       public int width   Vertices width     public int height  Vertices height      public ListltFloatgt map  new ArrayListltFloatgt                    param width The width of the map xaxis       param height The height of the map zaxiz, NOT yaxis           public HeightMapint width, int height           this.width  width         this.height  height          forint i  0 i lt width  height i               map.add1.0f                    public Dimension getSize           return new Dimensionthis.width, this.height           public int getWidth           return this.width           public int getHeight           return this.height                 Set the height of a vertex of the map          public void setHeightint x, int y, float h           int index  x          ify gt 0               index  y  1  width                   map.setindex  1, h           DEBUG         forint i  0 i lt map.size i               System.out.printlni     height   map.geti                             public float getHeightint x, int y           int index  x          ify gt 0               index  y  1  width                   return map.getindex           public float getHeightfloat x, float y           return this.getHeightintx, inty                  This method simplifies the heightmap.

Negative 4985 pI have a really old application using an SQL database that I need to update. I would like to take also the opportunity to improve the database structure and I would appreciate some advice. p  pThe basic problem is that an important part of the database must be user configurable without touching the code. To be more concrete, the DB stores products and these products have different specs i.e. columns depending on the type. The app must be able to search for any of the columns. There are only a few types 20 but the administrator must be able to create a new one without touching the code. The data that needs to be stored for each product are either strings or floats, and never more than 7 of each type.p  pInstead of creating an interface to create and delete tables, the following solution was implemented.  In the Products Table, there is one column for the id one column for the ProducTypeID 7 string columns and 7 float columns  In a ProducType column, there is one column for the ProducTypeID, and 14 string columns indicating the names of the 7 string columns and 7 float columns for each product type. If a product does not need so many columns, the column name is NULLp  pThis works but due to the extra indirection is extremely annoying to maintain the client code.p  pThe question is Should I stay with an SQL DB and add a way to createdelete tables or should I use a noSQL DB Which are the pros and cons in each casep

I would like to either use a faster compression class, or control the current classs parameters so that decompression would be faster I am most worried about decompression time as it occurs many times, slow compression is bearable. I am also willing to pay the price of a larger compressed file, for decompression speed.p  pWhen compressing using different software you can usually choose compression level, with values like Fastest, Fast, Normal, Best. Sometimes you even get more parameters like Compression Method, Dictionary Size, Word Size, etc.p  pDoes anybody know how to control these parameters via code, and what are some recommended values Or just knows of fastdecompression classesp

Negative 4985 pI have some functionality in my gui that updates a given text component over time. Ideally, Id like it to accept anything that has a codegetTextsetTextcode method. This is easily done with codeJTextFieldcode and codeJTextPanecode as they share the common parent class codeJTextComponentcode which hold the getset methods. The issue comes in when I try to include codeJLabelcode, as, unfortunately, its codegetsetTextcode methods do not come from a common parent class or interface. p  pTo solve this, I see two paths. p  h31h3  pcreate a common interface codeEditableTextcode, then have my own alias versions of codeJTextFieldcode, codeJTextPanecode, and codeJLabelcode that implement the interface. p  pAla p  precodepublic class MyJTextField extends JTextField implements EditableText    codepre  pMy Issue with this is that Im creating a ton of class bloat just so the compiler knows that I want to access two methods on these classes. p  h32h3  pSome kind of template patternish thing that accepts a very general parent class and then casts it up to either a codeJLabelcode or codeJTextComponentcode. p  pSomething along the lines of p  precodeclass JLabelImplementation       private JLabel label       public MyClassJComponent componenet          this.label  JLabel component         class JTextComponentImplementation       private JTextComponent textField       public MyClassJComponent componenet          this.textField  JTextComponent component       codepre  pNote Havent actually tried the above.

So if I open a large file, it takes a few tens of seconds to count and display the no. of lines. However if I select a large file and before the codestaticTextcode widget is updated, open another file which is smaller, the codestaticTextcode widget shows the new count, but after some time shows the count of the previous file. I understand this is because the previous thread was still running and updated the widget after it ended.p  pI tried working around it by passing a flag variable as a parameter to the counter function, to check if the widget has been updated. However it does not seem to work. Is there any other way to avoid thisp

Negative 4985 pIm in the process of automating 2013 docx creation using Open XML SDK 2.5 and Custom XML Parts. p  pThe SDK is used to push modified Custom XML into the doc. p  pIdeally, I want a simple text node in my XML to provide the hyperlinks URL. p  pHowever, Im unable to make this work. Once I change the text into a Hyperlink, the Custom XML gets stuffed with a mess of document markup. If I remove that markup, the text is no longer a hyperlink. p  pThis isnt a dealbreaker for the document, but it would be nice to be able to supply the links URL in the XML, so the user can simply click it in the document. Currently the user has to copy and paste the link.p

Negative 4985 pI have an application that creates an MS Word document and runs it.  Im trying to figure out which layer to put that code in.p  pWould running the external document be part of the presentation layer or part of the business logic layerp  pOne the one hand, it seems like it should be part of the presentation layer since it ultimately results in something being presented to the user albeit within an external application.  On the other hand, it seems more like a business logic layer concern since the presentation layer might only want to be concerned with the current applications UI, and because all its really doing when it comes down to it is running an external process  something that could be used for multiple external processes which dont all have a presentation aspect to them.p  pAlso, Im not sure if SO is the right place for this question.

Negative 4985 pExcuse my ignorance. But i am having the hardest time in the world understanding these typed arrays  blobs crap in JS.

Anyway, my server is not the problem. my problem is what to do with this data once it hits the client. The array has a method called code.toArrayBuffercode which i can use to convert it into to you guessed it an array buffer. but, I dont really know what to do with this data to place this .mp4 data into a video element... any suggestions p  pHeres what i think i know  I know that i have to append the src using the URL.createObjectURL method. Im also aware that said method only accepts blobs i think. p  pIve tried reading up on this, but all of the instructions seem so specific to people who would understand this stuff already. IT all seems so confusing. Any help would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 4985 pthis is the first time I am seeing this... it seems that when I trigger the segue to the settingsViewController xcode is loading 2 View controllers on top of each other.  The View controller with the byDate and byCategory buttons is part of a page view controller and I dont understand why this is happening.p  pHere is a photo of my storyboard  the settings VC is the one above Add New Transaction and the summary VC loads view controllers as the DataSource of a UIPageViewControllerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comepv5y.png altenter image description herep  pHere is my result img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrZGoA.png altenter image description herep  pAny ideasp
Negative 4985 pI have a bash script that every night starts my standalone EC2 Spark cluster and executes an application. I would like to be noticed when the application has finished so I can stop the cluster. p  pI was wondering if there is some sort of callbacks based on spark application status.p  pIm pretty new to spark so another hint to solve this will be appreciated.p  pThanks. p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWith the json provided by codehttpltmasterhostgt8080metricsmasterjsoncode or codehttpltmasterhostgt8080metricsapplicationsjsoncode I can get the status of the application WAITING,RUNNING,FINISHED but I cant get the status of the driver that will tell you if the execution FAILED. Im sure that there must be an specific configuration for the metrics to show this, but I couldnt find it. p  pIn order to get this kind of status I scrapped the web UI provided in codehttpltmasterhostgt8080code to find the driver executing my application and get its status.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4Ex10.png altenter image description herep
Negative 4985 pIve written a small android app  jni module to investigate TCPKEEPLIVE behavior. The app launches service which connects to 8080 port of the server, enables keepalive on the socket and send a hello baby line to the server.p  pThe Main activity also creates a TimerTask which uses ConnectivityManager.getActiveNetwork each 10 seconds to monitor network availability.p  pI observe that connection is established correctly , the hello line is seen by the server and keepalive mechanism is working, however after 3 to 5 minute of operation the connection is close by Android terminal I see TCP.FIN an my local router and on the server. I wonder if somebody has explanation for this behaviour.p  pHere is the Java Codep  precodepackage com.mbdsys.connmon  import android.app.Activity import android.app.ActionBar import

Negative 4985 pIm coding a Spring 4 project with a REST interface and an AngularJS client.p  pI have put in place a login page with a basic authentication that creates a JWT token on successful login, with the token being used on all subsequent requests.p  pIt works just fine.p  pBut I had to put my token creation in the login controllerp  precodetokenAuthenticationService.addTokenToResponseHeaderresponseHeaders, credentialsResource.getEmail codepre  pI wonder if it is the right place to do it.p  pAt first, I had tried to create a filter where this token would be created but I failed to get it plugged in the Spring security configuration.p  pHere is this filterp  precodepublic class CreateAuthenticationTokenFilter extends AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter       Autowired     private TokenAuthenticationService tokenAuthenticationService      Autowired     private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager      public CreateAuthenticationTokenFilterString urlMapping          supernew AntPathRequestMatcherurlMapping         setAuthenticationManagerauthenticationManager           Override     public Authentication attemptAuthenticationHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws AuthenticationException, IOException, ServletException          UserDetailsWrapper user  new ObjectMapper.readValuerequest.getInputStream, UserDetailsWrapper.class         UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken loginToken  new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationTokenuser.getUsername, user.getPassword         return getAuthenticationManager.authenticateloginToken           Override     protected void successfulAuthenticationHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain, Authentication authentication throws IOException, ServletException          tokenAuthenticationService.addTokenToResponseHeaderresponse, authentication        codepre  pBut the trouble I have with this above filter is two fold first I dont understand why there is this attemptAuthentication method. I dont feel like authenticating with this since I already implemented a working CustomAuthenticationProvider class that implements the  AuthenticationProvider class. And second I dont know how to plug it in the configuration and wonder if this config is the way to gop  precodehttp.addFilterBeforenew CreateAuthenticationTokenFilterRESTConstants.SLASH  RESTConstants.API  RESTConstants.SLASH  RESTConstants.ADMINS  RESTConstants.SLASH  RESTConstants.LOGIN, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class codepre  pApart from this filter I had also tried to implement a RESTSimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler that extends the SimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler class. But then, the only way I found to plug it in the security configuration was to have a formLogin which didnt fly with my stateless REST api.p  pThis is why I ended up creating the token in the controller. Again, it works fine in there.p  pIm using Spring 4.1.2.RELEASE and Spring Security 3.2.5.RELEASEp  pSo Im left with a few questionsp  p1 Is creating the token in the controller okay or should the token be created somewhere else p  p2 Is the formLogin only for session based web login only or is it also for stateless REST api login p

Everything seems to be in the correct place as soon as main runs, with the size of the map showing the correct number of populated items as well as the variables containing the values shown before main.p  precodeinclude ltmapgt include ltiostreamgt  static stdmapltint, const chargt staticMap  const char const a  staticMap[0]  []gtconst char return a const char const b  staticMap[1]  []gtconst char return b const char const c  staticMap[2]  []gtconst char return c const char const d  staticMap[3]  []gtconst char return d const char const e  staticMap[4]  []gtconst char return e  int main      stdcout ltlt  Items  ltlt staticMap.size ltlt n ltlt stdendl      stdcout ltlt Valuesn     stdcout ltlt a   ltlt a ltlt n     stdcout ltlt b   ltlt b ltlt n     stdcout ltlt c   ltlt c ltlt n     stdcout ltlt d   ltlt d ltlt n     stdcout ltlt e   ltlt e ltlt n      stdcout ltlt stdendl      stdcout ltlt Map Contents ltlt stdendl     for unsigned i  0 i lt 5 i        stdcout ltlt t ltlt staticMap[i] ltlt stdendl           return 0  codepre  pHere is the result after trying both G and CLang I used the flags stdc11 Wall Werror Wextra pedanticerrorsp  precode Items 5 Values a  a b  b c  c d  d e  e Map Contents     a     b     c     d     e codepre  pIs this something inherently allowed in C I even went so far as to create my own map type and got the same results but am still not sure if its behavior I can rely on.p
Negative 4985 pI have 2 radio buttons, bounded to an XML via XPath. If I select the first radio button, I will need to get the selected value of a combo box, and set it to a XML Element. However, if I select the second radio button, Ill just need to set a fixed hardcoded value.p  pIm having trouble getting the value from the combo box when I select the first radio button. Ive tried  using ConverterParameter and I found out it doesnt allow bindings, and using MultiBinding didnt help either.p  pPlease advice.p  pThanksp
Negative 4985 pI am trying to create a simple UI using JSF 1.2 my client has been using this version for years and the existing application runs this version  so unable to move to 2.x. The UI is for uploading an excel file and displaying the contents on a datatable.  I am using JSF 1.2. I tried doing this using a JSP and everything works fine. Now i tried to move to XHTML. When I access the Application URL, IE v8 does not render the JSF page  instead it opens up a dialog box prompting OpenSave option. With Chrome, I see only the Head section of my XHTML rendered. The remaining portion is not.

Negative 4985 pIve run into a situation where an infinite loop on the client is crashing the Meteor server.  The infinite loop is a bug that I will fix, and not the subject of this question.  My concern is that a malicious user could create their own infinite loop and crash the Meteor server.p  pThe infinite loop in question is repeatedly making calls to codeMeteor.subscribe...code and codeMeteor.call...code.  It looks like these requests are being queued on the server to the point of incapacitation, even though the clients intention was to abandon them.  Is there a way to tell the server that the request has been abandoned and to remove it from the queuep  pI suppose this wouldnt protect the server from a client that makes thousands of successive requests without abandoning them, so that question would supersede this one if anyone has an answer to it.

Negative 4985 pI need a fast and efficient implementation for finding the index of the maximum value in an array in CUDA. This operation needs to be performed several times.

Negative 4985 pThe Project I like the programs that come with Windows Vista, and I like Windows 7. As of now, I have Windows Movie Maker, Windows DVD Maker, Windows Calendar, and Windows Mail all working, and they are all way better than Windows Live. I realize that Windows Live Photo Gallery 2009 is similar to Windows Vista Photo Gallery, but beside my OCD about the interface, it does not integrate with the other programs at all. Well, the first question becomes, why does it not just work like the others I have embarked on a quest to find out. p  pFirst I did a lot of trial and error. I attempted registering the dlls, but nothing happened. My hypothesis became that something in the system was patched to prevent it from working like Mail was, but I have realized that that idea has problems, namely, Mail was left on the system and Photo Gallery was not, and Movie Maker should not have worked by that logic. What I found after swapping dlls around was that the executables could be interchangeable, but only to open Windows Live Mail, not the other way around. When I did not arrange the dlls properly, then the program simply did not open, so I got the idea that it was dll incompatibility. Well I decided to get OllyDBG out and root around in Assembly code and that is bad because I am a beginner to Java, but I have seen simple reverse engineering tutorials in the past and thought I would give it a go.p  pI started with the x86 version of Photo Gallery. I executed it on Windows 7 x64 and on Widows Vista x64. On Windows 7 it simply closed as if I had hit the exit button myself but I had not without so much as a dialog. On Windows Vista it ran, so I closed it and both ended up in the same place in ntdll.dll. Sorry I had to link to the image instead of uploading, I dont have any reputation, because I dont come here much.p  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimage60ocdmq2b relnofollowExhibit Aap  pNotice the difference In Windows 7 there is an ADD.ESP,4 every few lines. The addresses in Vista are also consistent while in 7 they change every time I open at least for the main executable I do not know what this means, but if someone does it might be enlightening.p  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimageb1y9jea8f relnofollowExhibit Bap  pThis one is odd, because in Windows Vista, where it works, I get ERRORSXSKEYNOTFOUND 0x36B7. The program executes just fine. I had the thought that if I could locate what it is finding in Windows 7 that it is not in Vista, and somehow remove it one might question if it is a good idea, but if it is causing this then it might be a garbage key anyway, that it might but probably wont like everything else Ive tried solve the problem.p  pI looked back at this a little later and started pausing the program at various point and what I found was that all those sections in Exhibit A were I think executing dlls, but in Vista MOV EAX,29 was not invoked until I closed the program myself, so even if M did not purposely patch it which dont think they did now it appears that the new ntdll, for some reason, does not know to stop before it hits the close function. I tried various ways of patching it. I used the call stack to show the call of ntdll.772CFCB0, and I went up to the first line with a carrot and starting NOPing them, because I got the idea that this was a unique close function somewhere, but I dont remember where I could be wrong, but I save a backup and patched the ntdll, and I did that with a couple other suspect areas, even trying to remove the MOV EAX,29 I forgot that this was also present and used in Vista at the time, but I am a noob. None of the patching mattered however. Even when placed under SysWOW64, the ntdll always looked the same, even where I altered it. The altered file is still intact where I put it, so M mustve pulled another crappy security move on me I understand they want my system to be secure from hackers, but when they start protecting me from me, I get a little upset, I mean I at least know that ntdll is not in use by windows explorer or other permanently running processes because I checked and I have a backup which I shall soon restore.p  pSorry that was so long, I have put quite a bit of effort into this, and from my searches online there are others who would like this issue fixed as much as I do, so if anyone could help us because I intend to help others with the issue if it gets fixed out it would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p  pUpdate Here are the results from WinDBG.p  precodeMicrosoft R Windows Debugger Version 6.3.9600.17298 X86 Copyright c Microsoft Corporation.

Negative 4985 pIt seems that applying functions to data frames is typically wrt series e.g df.applymyfun and so such functions index one row at a time.

Negative 4985 pWe have developed a web application using JSP and Servlet. The server we use is Tomcat 7. We have hired a host Daily Razor with private JVM to launch the application in production level.p  pNow, in our application, user can visit a particular form, browse for a file in his PC and upload it to the server.

Negative 4985 pI have a few forms that allow the user to add multiple documents to a collection at the same time which I want to convert to use AutoForm but I cant work how best to do it.p  pFor example, the user can create a class in a school.  A class can have a name, subject and teacher.  Instead of a form to add just one class at a time I have rows which allow adding many classes at the same time. Heres a simple example how it looks before I add AutoForm.  This gives me three rows with a name, subject and teacher column in each row.p  precodeltform classclassformgt     ltdiv classtablerowgt         ltinput typetext namename[] placeholdernamegt         ltinput typetext namesubject[] placeholdersubjectgt         ltinput typetext nameteacher[] placeholderteachergt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classtablerowgt         ltinput typetext namename[] placeholdernamegt         ltinput typetext namesubject[] placeholdersubjectgt         ltinput typetext nameteacher[] placeholderteachergt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classtablerowgt         ltinput typetext namename[] placeholdernamegt         ltinput typetext namesubject[] placeholdersubjectgt         ltinput typetext nameteacher[] placeholderteachergt     ltdivgt      ltbutton typesubmitgtSaveltbuttongt ltformgt codepre  pI can create a schema for a class and use AutoForm to create a form for one class at a time, but how can I use AutoForm to create multiple documents in one form as abovep  p[The example code  has been simplified a lot here.  It uses Select2 elements to choose subject and teacher and there are more fields and s in the actual code.  Also, as the rows fill up I automatically add more rows.  Im keeping this example simple and will tackle those problems later] p

Negative 4985 pI am attempting to set a custom view for callouts on my map, but I cant seem to get the positioning right. The view is just a series of labels and after setting their text properties, I calculate the dimensions of the custom view and set its frame to be at 0, 0, calculatedWidth, calculatedHeight. It is then set as the callouts customView.p  pOn the first tap on a graphic, it works fine, although there is a slightly visible outline from the callout that isnt too much of an issue since Ive made the colors match. However, on all subsequent taps on any graphic, the callout bubble that ArcGIS generates does not have my view centered in it anymore. It is quite noticeably positioned up and to the left.

Negative 4985 pI wish to write several rules that extract the contents of tar archives to produce a number of files that are then used as input dependencies for other rules.  I wish this to work even with parallel builds.  Im not using recursive make.p  pFirst up, sorry for the marathon question, but I dont think I can explain it well in a shorter form.p  pThink of untarring a collection of source files and then compiling them with rules stored outside of the archive to produce various build artefacts that are then, in turn, used further.  I am not seeking other arrangements that lead to the omission of this problem.  Just take it for granted that I have good reason to do this.   p  pIll demonstrate my issue with a contrived example.  Of course, I started with something basicp  precodeTAR  test.tar.bz2  CONTENTS  addprefix out,filterout ,shell tar tf TAR  out TAR         rm rf out         mkdir out         tar xvf lt C out touch  rm rf out exit 1  CONTENTS out  sums CONTENTS         md5sum  gt   .DELETEONERROR .DEFAULTGOAL  all .PHONY all clean all sums clean         rm rf out sums codepre  pThe thinking here is that since CONTENTS are all of the files in the archive, and they all depend on codeoutcode, then to run the codesumscode target we need to end up extracting the archive.p  pUnfortunately, this doesnt always work if you use a parallel invocation after a previous build when only codetest.tar.bz2code is updated, because codemakecode may decide to check the timestamp of CONTENTS embeforeem running the codeoutcode rule, which means it thinks that each of the sources is older than codesumscode, so there is nothing to dop  precode make clean rm rf out sums   make j6 rm rf out mkdir out tar xvf test.tar.bz2 C out touch  rm rf out exit 1 data.txt file weird.file.name dir diranother.c dirmore md5sum outdata.txt outfile outweird.file.name outdiranother.c outdirmore gt sums   touch test.tar.bz2   make j6 rm rf out mkdir out tar xvf test.tar.bz2 C out touch  rm rf out exit 1 data.txt file weird.file.name dir diranother.c dirmore codepre  pOops  The codesumscode rule didnt runp  pSo, the next attempt was to tell make that the one untar rule actually does make all the CONTENTS directly.  This seems better since were telling make whats really going on, so it knows when to forget any cached timestamps for targets when they are remade through their rule. p  pFirst, lets look at what seems to work, and then Ill get to my problemp  precodeTAR  test.tar.bz2  CONTENTS  addprefix out,filterout ,shell tar tf TAR   Heres the change. addprefix ,patsubst out,,CONTENTS TAR         rm rf out         mkdir out         tar xvf lt C out touch  rm rf out exit 1  sums CONTENTS         md5sum  gt   .DELETEONERROR .DEFAULTGOAL  all .PHONY all clean all sums clean         rm rf out sums codepre  pIn this case, weve effectively got a rule that saysp  precodedata.txt file weird.file.name diranother.c dirmore test.tar.bz2         rm rf out         mkdir out         tar xvf lt C out touch  rm rf out exit 1 codepre  pNow you can see one of the reasons  I forced the output into an codeoutcode directory to give me a place to use the codecode so I could use a pattern rule.  I am forced to use a pattern rule even though there isnt a strong pattern here because it is the only way make can be told that one rule creates multiple output files from a single invocation.  Isnt itp  pThis works if any of the files are touched not important for my use case or if the codetest.tar.bz2code file is touched, even in parallel builds, because make has the information it needs running this recipe makes all these files and will change all their timestamps.p  pFor example, after a previous successful buildp  precode touch test.tar.bz2   make j6 rm rf out mkdir out tar xvf test.tar.bz2 C out touch  rm rf out exit 1 data.txt file weird.file.name dir diranother.c dirmore md5sum outdata.txt outfile outweird.file.name outdiranother.c outdirmore gt sums codepre  pSo, if I have a working solution, whats my problemp  pWell, I have many of these archives to extract, each with their own set of CONTENTS.  I can manage that, but the trouble comes in writing a nice pattern rule.  Since each archive needs its own rule defined, the patterns for each rule must not overlap even if the archives have similar or identical content.  That means the output paths for the extracted files emmustem be made unique for each archive, as inp  precodeTAR  test.tar.bz2  CONTENTS  addprefix out.TAR,filterout ,shell tar tf TAR  patsubst out.TAR,out.,CONTENTS TAR         rm rf out.TAR         mkdir out.TAR         tar xvf lt C out.TAR touch  rm rf out.TAR exit 1  sums CONTENTS         md5sum  gt   .DELETEONERROR .DEFAULTGOAL  all .PHONY all clean all sums clean         rm rf out.TAR sums codepre  pSo, this can be made to work with the right targetspecific variables, but it now means that the extraction points are all ugly in a way that is very specifically tied to how the makefile is constructedp  precode make j6 rm rf out.test.tar.bz2 mkdir out.test.tar.bz2 tar xvf test.tar.bz2 C out.test.tar.bz2 touch  rm rf out.test.tar.bz2 exit 1 data.txt file weird.file.name dir diranother.c dirmore md5sum out.test.tar.bz2data.txt out.test.tar.bz2file out.test.tar.bz2weird.file.name out.test.tar.bz2diranother.c out.test.tar.bz2dirmore gt sums codepre  pThe next natural step I took was to try to combine static pattern rules with the multipletargetsviapatternrule approach.  This would let me keep the patterns very general, but limit their application to a specific set of targetsp  precodeTAR  test.tar.bz2  CONTENTS  addprefix out,filterout ,shell tar tf TAR   Same as second attempt, except CONTENTS static pattern prefix CONTENTS addprefix ,patsubst out,,CONTENTS TAR         rm rf out         mkdir out         tar xvf lt C out touch  rm rf out exit 1  sums CONTENTS         md5sum  gt   .DELETEONERROR .DEFAULTGOAL  all .PHONY all clean all sums clean         rm rf out sums codepre  pGreat  Except it doesnt workp  precode make Makefile5  multiple target patterns.  Stop.  make version GNU Make 4.0 codepre  pSo, is there a way to use multiple target patterns with a static pattern rule  If not, is there another way to achieve what I have in the last working example above, but without the constraint on the output paths to make unique patterns  I basically need to tell make when you unpack this archive, all of the files in this directory which I am willing to enumerate if necessary have new timestamps.  A solution where I can force make to restart if and only if it unpacks an archive would also be acceptable, but less ideal.p

Negative 4985 pI would like to keep a file in each of my git branches called branch.notenote is a file extension I made a custom vim syntax highlighting for, that allows me to write notes in the fashion that I enjoy I want to use this file to write notes about that branch and what I am doing on it. I want this file to be tracked locally so when I switch to a branch I can just open my notes file and see my notes for that branch, however I do not want this file to go to remote when I push to origin. My dilemma is that if I put the file in my .gitignore its not tracked, and wont differ between branches. So really what Im looking for is a way to ignore that file only when Im pushing to remote and track it normally on my local machine. p  pI understand that git has a notes command, but those notes are kept on an individual commit basis, Id like to have notes for the entire branch, that way I can still have them when I commit my work at the end of the day. p

Two of them are static and others are dynamic which is why I need to dynamically change the cell height as soon as any of those labels changes. p  pI dont know how to properly add constraints.

Negative 4985 pI am writing a spark job in scala to be run with spark 1.3.0. My RDD transformation functions use classes from a third party library which are not Serializable. To make closure serialization possible, I wrap these objects in com.twitter.chill.MeatLocker which is itself java.io.Serializable but uses Kryo for the wrapped objects. Then I make an uber jar using assembly.p  pWhen I run my job, the executors tasks fail throwing a ClassNotFoundException for the same classes that I wrapped inside MeatLocker. I know that there was a related bug in spark 1.2.x but googling on this subject suggests me that it has been fixed in 1.3.0. a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSPARK6069 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSPARK6069ap  pI have tried spark configuration property spark.executor.userClassPathFirsttrue but to no effect. I passed this property to sparksubmit script like so codesparksubmit class ltMyClassgt ltMyJargt conf spark.executor.userClassPathFirsttruecodep  pBeyond this I am stuck with no option but to get the source of the third party library and include it in my project after making these classes implement java.io.Serializable. That way I will eliminate the need for Kryo serialization altogether thereby not running into this issue but I hope for a better way.p

In Wicket 1.5 I programmer before me was adding JS and CSS reference in constructor and then component, simmilar to thisp  precode    public abstract class PageTemplate extends WebPage implements IHeaderContributor          public BarePageTemplate              thisnull                   public BarePageTemplatePageParameters params              superparams             addJavascriptPackageResource.getHeaderContributionResourceMarker.class, jsjquery1.4.2.min.js             addJavascriptPackageResource.getHeaderContributionResourceMarker.class, jsjqueryui1.8.4.custom.min.js             [...]             jGrowlMarker  new LabeljGrowlMarker  placeholder for jgrowl messages             jGrowlMarker.setOutputMarkupIdtrue             jGrowlMarker.addnew JGrowlBehavior             addjGrowlMarker               codepre  pIn wicket 1.5 this is no longer possible. According to a hrefhttpscwiki.apache.orgconfluencedisplayWICKETMigrationtoWicket1.5 relnofollowmigration guidea I refactored this code into thisp  precode     public abstract class PageTemplate extends WebPage implements IHeaderContributor          public BarePageTemplate              thisnull               public BarePageTemplatePageParameters params          superparams         jGrowlMarker  new LabeljGrowlMarker  placeholder for jgrowl messages         jGrowlMarker.setOutputMarkupIdtrue         jGrowlMarker.addnew JGrowlBehavior         addjGrowlMarker           Override     public void renderHeadIHeaderResponse response          response.renderJavaScriptReferencenew CommonResourceRefjsjquery1.4.2.min.js         response.renderJavaScriptReferencenew CommonResourceRefjsjqueryui1.8.4.custom.min.js [...]   codepre  pThis piece of code works, what I mean by that is that it includes those codejscode. What causing me an issue is fact that right now my component in this case jGrowlMarker is rendering in page before page includes those jsp  precode jGrowl component  ltscript typetextjavascript src.wicketresourcepl.softq.commons.ui.resource.ResourceMarkerjsjquery1.4.2.minver65B352E1BA79F0E2A3B1E014BC2571AF.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript src.wicketresourcepl.softq.commons.ui.resource.ResourceMarkerjsjqueryui1.8.4.custom.minver88A9784D8E08D25998F239E2D65F03D7.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pBecause of that it doesnt work properly I believe thats an issue. It tries to create jGrowl component but jGrowl.js is added after this component. code[...]code symbolizes rest of my js and css refenreces including jGrowl ones. Ive tried to add  codesuper.renderHeadresponsecode to coderenderHeadcode but it also doesnt work super.renderHead refers to empty one in codeComponent.classcode. p  pSo my question is how to add component after coderenderHeadcode initializes or how to add it inside coderenderHeadcode. Im not an expert in wicket so if you need more piece of code, let me know.p

Negative 4985 pI have been given the daunting task of sifting through a database of over 30,000 registrants and correcting the letter casing of names and addresses where needed.  I am trying to write a program that will search for names and addresses in our database that are either all lowercase or all uppercase and output these mishaps in a webpage for me to review and correct more efficiently.

Negative 4985 pNot sure if the title is properly worded, but what I am trying to ask is how would you signify the end of input for an array using newline. Take the following code for example. Not matter how many numbersmore or less you type during the input for score[6], it must take 6 before you can proceed. Is there a method to change it so that an array can store 6 or 100 variables, but you can decide how many variables actually contain values. The only way I can think of doing this is to somehow incorporate n, so that pressing enter once creates a newline and pressing enter again signifies that you dont want to set any more values. Or is something like this not possiblep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std int main      int i,score[6],max     coutltltEnter the scoresltltendl     cingtgtscore[0]     max  score[0]     fori  1ilt6i              cingtgtscore[i]         ifscore[i]gtmax             max  score[i]          return 0  codepre

I dont know why it is working fine first few days and then suddenly the results are very bad.

If I do so without calling codeshowRunscode function inside my codeaddRunscode function, I wont see the new entry Ive just added, I will have to reload the page to see it.p  p4 If I will call codeshowRunscode function inside my codeaddRunscode function I will see duplicated entries, because function will be called again on each codeaddRuncode call.p  p5 To see new entry after I add it I have to remove all other entries from main page, that have class codecurrentcode and after that I call codeshowRunscode function that will add all entries to the main page again, strongBUTstrong they wont have any event handlers because they were created after page was loaded.p  p6 So now I have to add all the handlers again.p  pI have a feeling there must be a better way to do what I want  to add new elements to the page, without the need to do all the steps Ive described above.p  pIve tried reloading the a hrefhttpsapi.jquerymobile.compagecontainermethodchange relnofollowpagecontainera by using it like thisp  precodebody.pagecontainerchange, home,                  transition  fade,                 reload  true              codepre  pBut If I do so, it has no effect.p  pHere is live Demo a hrefhttprunningtracker.herokuapp.com relnofollowhttprunningtracker.herokuapp.comap

Also, who decides what a size of a short int for example on my machine would be  also is it a language standard, compiler, OS, CPU .. etc p  pThanks in advance p  pEdit  Ok so I understood from here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18195715whyisunsignedintegeroverflowdefinedbehaviorbutsignedintegeroverflowisWhy is unsigned integer overflow defined behavior but signed integer overflow isn39tap  pthat Its the processor who defines what happens in an overflow situation like for example in my machine it started from 32767 all over again, depending on representations for signed values of the processor, ie. is it sign magnitude, ones complement or twos complement ...p  pis that right  and in my case When the result given was like starting from the min value 32767 again.. how do you suppose my CPU is representing the signed values, and how did the value 32767 for example come up again, binary calculations that lead to this, pls   p

work around, while I dont have this fixed.

As such, I have been able to add some debugging messages to see what values were currently used. To my surprise, the Password property is not trickling through and is likely why this fails. The username is correctly applied. Could it be because the Password is not valid in VS2013, or ready from decrypted password If I enter the password directly into the .wpp.targets file it works now  also have to modify the manual delete command so it doesnt use Password.br At this point, Im now trying to identify how to utilize the webdeploy password in the .wpp.targets file as set in the VS Publishing GUIdialog.p

However, I am now just learning how to use arrays. Any advice on how to split this string variable with more efficient code would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 4985 pI have a simple ray tracer that I did some time ago. What I am trying to do now is improving it and transforming it in a distributed ray tracer. The first thing I am doing is shooting a bunch of rays instead of a single ray through each pixel. Each ray of my bunch is slightly jittered from the center of the relative pixel.

Negative 4985 pA Deezer player widget of the kind which can be created over at a hrefhttpdevelopers.deezer.commusicpluginsplayer relnofollowhttpdevelopers.deezer.commusicpluginsplayera has a couple of visual style  layout options, such as theme dark  light and text highlight colour, but it cannot be controlled via Javascript. Using the Deezer JS SDK to create a player enables me to control it, but there dont seem to be any of the visual options except for format, but that doesnt do in my case. Are these options just missing from the SDK docs or are they completely unavailable when creating a player using the SDK If the latter is the case, is there any way I could control an embed created at the Deezer Music Plugins page By control I mean I need to be able to play  pause the player, receive play  paused events and get the currently playing track title.p  pBackground Im trying to achieve a symbiosis of multiple audio and  or video playback services within a single page the goal is to stop any currently active player when a user starts playback in another player and to have an always visible playpause button at the top of the viewport along with the currently playing tracks name. If there is any other way to do this that Im missing, Im all ears  I know I could theoretically build my own player UI, but I wanted to retain the user experience that comes with a given service.p

Negative 4985 pI am trying to optimize my code to speed up calculations and reduce memory consumption. I need to store data for the year and the cost.

Since I have millions of these arrays held in memory and used for calculations, I want to minimize the memory and performance impact.p  pTo clarify, the way I use the data is for charting purposes. Once I assign costs to the years, I sum up the arrays based on the object series they are part of. Then I display them in a stacked bar chart.p  pIs there a better way of storing my data Im considering keyvalue list so I only store the nonzero costs and year but I dont know if that would help much.p

Negative 4985 pI have a codeToolbarcode being used as an codeActionBarcode with two items. I only want to ever display one at a time as they kind of replace each other. The problem is that when i replace a codeFragmentcode, it call codeonCreateOptionsMenucode and will inflate the menu again, meaning that the same action button will be shown, even if the other one was previously in the codeActionBarcode. I have to need to change anything in the codeActionBarcode from my codeFragmentscode or when a new codeFragmentcode is displayedwith codeFragmentManager.FragmentTransaction.replacecode. So my question is how do I not call codeonCreateOptionsMenucode when a new fragment is displayedp  pI cant use a codebooleancode because I will still need it to reinflate on orientation change. And any advice on how to handle orentation change for my situationp  pI can post code, but it seems more conceptual and Im not sure that it would help.p

Negative 4985 pI am facing a problem where I need to a identify whether an OPCAE client has previously connected to the OPCAE server which I am writing. The reason I need this is to make sure the client doesnt miss any alarms while it was disconnected by caching alarms in the server and then as the client reconnects, do a Refresh with the missed alarms if the previous subscriptions included those alarms. There is no such requirement in the OPC AE spec to catch alarms while disconnected.p  pIn the previous version of the OPCAE server it made all subscription handles unique for a client, so client A would say use client handles 1100 and client 2 would use 101200 or something, this only works if the client is a custom one knowing what range they are allowed to use, connecting with say Matrikon OPC AE explorer could potentially reuse some of those handles.p  pIs there some standard way to handle this When regarding the OPC there is the interface codeIOPCCommoncode with a method called codeSetClientNamecode but that seems to be a more of an ad hoc way for a client to identify itself, if you start two OPC clients on the same PC they will get the same name at least with Matrikon Explorer it seems so.p  pClients can also connect remotely to the server via DCOM.p  pIs there maybe some way in the IConnectionPoint to identify a client that previously connectedp

Negative 4985 pUsing KnockoutJS 3.3.0 and the 0.5.6 release of the original Ducksboard gridster repo.  I have an observableArray that is bound to my gridster ul.  Im using the afterAdd and beforeRemove callbacks in the template binding to track when knockout is adding and removing the DOM nodes for the items in my list so that I can inform Gridster.  p  pThe interesting thing is that the li nodes are never returned to the beforeRemove callback for me to appropriately handle them.  For example, when an item in the array is removed the beforeRemove callback fires for the text nodes that are associated with that item, but not for the li itself.  There are ways to work around it, but this is indicative of some incompatibility between how gridsterjquery and knockout are tracking the DOM and is likely at least part of the memory issues that I am tracking.  p  pIn the console output for the fiddle, you can see that the li nodes are added appropriately but when the objects are removed from the knockout array the removeGridster function that is bound to the beforeRemove callback never fires for the li nodes.  Ive dug through the source code for a couple of hours and am not seeing anything that would be causing this.  p  pAny knockoutjquerygridster experts care to chime inp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8u0748sb8 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net8u0748sb8ap  pHTMLp  precodeltbutton databindclick add1gt Add 1 ltbuttongt ltbutton databindclick add20gt Add 20 ltbuttongt ltbuttongt  ltdiv classgridstergt lt The list.

Please guide.p  pI also followed link a hrefhttptechfeasthiranya.blogspot.in201209howtogetcupofcoffeewso2way.html relnofollowhttptechfeasthiranya.blogspot.in201209howtogetcupofcoffeewso2way.htmla, but because of improper or lack of steps its not finding useful.p
Negative 4985 pIm trying to use a xdmf file for Paraview to get data from a hdf5 file.  I have one of the variable in an array that contains 2 values and I need to use the first one. For that I have tried to use a Function but cant figure out how to use it. So if I do that p  precodeltAttribute Namerho CenterCell AttributeTypeScalargt     ltDataItem FormatHDF Precision8 Dimensions2gt         test.h5variablesrhocell     ltDataItemgt ltAttributegt codepre  pParaview gives a warning that I have an array with 2 values while I have only one cell this warning was expected. So I have added a Function like that p  precodeltAttribute Namerho CenterCell AttributeTypeScalargt     ltDataItem ItemTypeFunction Function0[12] Dimensions1gt         ltDataItem FormatHDF Precision8 Dimensions2gt             test.h5variablesrhocell         ltDataItemgt     ltDataItemgt ltAttributegt codepre  pAnd with that Paraview crashes no error message. To be honest Im not even sure if the array indexing is like in python start at 0 and 01 means only the first element... and I cant find any help on that. I have tried almost any combination of parameters but nothing seem to work.p  pTo be sure that my function syntax is not completely wrong I have tried that p  precodeltAttribute Namerho CenterCell AttributeTypeScalargt     ltDataItem ItemTypeFunction Function0  1.5 Dimensions2gt         ltDataItem FormatHDF Precision8 Dimensions2gt             test.h5variablesrhocell         ltDataItemgt     ltDataItemgt ltAttributegt codepre  pAnd it works, but obviously still give the warning about the number of cells.p

On the backend, Ill have rails convert the GeoJSON to a KML file, and use Paperclip to upload it to Amazon S3.  The rest of the data can be saved, and Paperclip will give me a URL to the KML file which I can associate with the activity.p  pIm a Rails noob, and I cant figure out how to do this nor track down anything to get me over this hurdle.  I considered using javascripts FormData.  I was very attracted to this approach, because implementation looks so simple, but apparently it can only really handle keyvalue pairs, not complex nested JSON data.p  pAny suggestions or strategies greatly appreciated.  And greatly appreciated if anyone can give detailed answers because, like I said, Im a few weeks fresh to rails and web development.p

AppAddress mAddressnew AppAddress mAddress.setNameaddress.getName mAddress.setCityaddress.getCity mAddress.setPinCodeaddress.getPinCode mAddress.setPhoneNumberaddress.getNumber mAddress.setAddressaddress.getAddress mAddressList.addmAddress codepre  pOr I forget about my custom object class called AppAddress and use my sublcass called ParseAddress that I have already defined and using to get the data from Address object. In that case code will be like thisp  precodeListltParseAddressgt mListnull In the for loop mListnew ArrayListltgt mList.addaddress codepre  pIN both cases, my recyclerView will change from public codeMyAddressAdapterContext context, ListltAppAddressgt listcode to codepublic MyAddressAdapterContext context, ListltParseAddressgt listcodeand I fill in the data in the onBindViewHolder function. Im able to do both but which one would be better assuming the recyclerView will have buttons to edit and delete these Address class objects.p  pEDIT So I guess I will stick to the first method then. As of now Im defining the getters and setters and moving data by that way. p  pParseObject AppAddress  RecyclerView row  User edits and changes data in AppAddress entity Update associated parse object. This is the flow I will be using. For the last step to work, I will need to make setter and getter for the original ParseObject ParseAddress as well correct p  pEDIT EDIT  Both methods will work but the first one allows more flexibility in the future as the App Address object can now even be a combination of one or more parse objects or have separate properties associated with it. Credits to Andrey Elizarov. Apart from the data, I am passing Parse Objects object id and recreating the object with createWithNoDataAddress, objectIdp

Negative 4985 pIm currently learning about Embers new datadown, actionsup paradigm for components. As discussed a hrefhttpemberjs.comblog20150510runuptotwooh.html relnofollowherea, however, sometimes I want to allow the child component to modify the property explicitly. This is where the emmutem helper comes in it creates a wrapper for the passed in value, containing a readonly value and a function to update it. The example on that page is for a simple button which increments a counter.p  pHow does this concept work if Im using the input helper inside a component For example, lets say Im building a form which consists of a bunch of special form componentsp  precode templatesindex.hbs ltformgt     formcontrol valuemut model.firstValue     formcontrol valuemut model.secondValue ltformgt codepre  pIf the emformcontrolem component just has the task of wrapping the input control, how do we use the passedin emmutem object correctly Is it something likep  precode templatescomponentsformcontrol.hbs input typetext valueattrs.value.value inputattrs.value.update codepre  pMy thinking here the value of the input element is set to the value of the emmutem object, and whenever the input value changes HTML5 input event the update method of the emmutem object is called to set the model property to the new value. It seems theres something wrong with my thinking though, because this doesnt work. What is the standard way of doing this now Im using Ember 1.13.8.p
