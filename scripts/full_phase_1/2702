Positive 2702 pMy team manages a Nexus repository used by many other teams in my company. A team is using it to store large archive files mostly 1.6GB, sometimes 4.5GB and that has been mostly fine, but now they are getting strange behaviour where they get a 504 Gateway Timeout on files that definitely exist. After some time, the files will become available, as if they have been downloaded. It might be recent uploads, or from several days ago, it seems fairly random. p  pI understand this error occurs with proxy repositories if the remote repo is slow, but this is hosted How can it have a timeout error retrieving a file on diskp  pThese errors do not appear in the logs at all, are shown in a box in the GUI, and it seems like its coming from some kind of frontend talking to a backend which is slow. There are no other relevant entries in the log file that explain why hosted files were slow to retrieve. Is there some kind of loading or hashing happening that would cause this, and can we turn it off or at least monitor it p  pThis is causing builds to break frequently in a major project and we cant even monitor when and how often it happens because there is no logs. p  pOur Nexus version is a bit old, 2.6.402, is upgrading likely to fix We need a solution that is either fast or has a good chance of working. p  pThanks in advance. p

I chose it because my server is still under development as well and sometimes it does not react fast enough for the actual timeout.p  pAs of the documentation the default timeout value is 60 seconds. Now, when setting an extremely short timeout, lets say 1 second, it works.p  pBut with my 1hour example, it seems to fall back to a lower value. In this case it results in timeouts being thrown after 75 seconds.p  pNow I wonder if there is any known maximum timeout in iOS 8 or 9.p

Positive 2702 pIm working on a long request to a django app nginx reverse proxy, mysql db, celeryrabbitMQredis set and have some doubts about the solution i should apply p  pstrongFunctionning strong One functionality of the app allows users to migrate thousands of objects from one system to another. Each migration is logged into a db, and the users are provided the possibility to get in a csv format the history of the migration  which objects have been migrated, which status success, errors, ...p  pTo get the history, a get request is sent to a django view, which returns, after serialization and rendering into csv, the download response.p  pstrongProblem strong the serialisation and rendering processes, for a large set of objects e.g. 160 000 are quite long and the request times out.p  pSome solutions I was thinking aboutfound thanks to pervious search are p  ul liIncreasing the amount of time before timeout  easy, but I saw everywhere that this is a global nginx setting and would affect every requests on the server.li liUsing an asynchronous task handled by celery  the concept would be to make an initial request to the server, which would launch the serializing and rendering task with celery, and give a special httpresponse to the client.

Positive 2702 pI really cant solve a problem Ive finished to write a web application during my internship which allows me, after a series of queries to Oracle DBs, to create my own tables on MySQL, then export the results in a custom fancy to XLS or PDF. The server side is in Java, the client side is in Javascript, some JQuery, and obviously HTML5. The server is set up with Apache Tomcat. The method I use to run the queries and then export the results to a directdownload file nothing stays in local, I use OutputStreams is written in a jsp which I call by a button press from index.jsp.  As I was in local on my laptop with my own Tomcat, the browser waited patiently for the Java to end, then returned the generated files. Right now, after the remote deploy in a local server, the browser times out casually giving an errnoresponse code. This happens both in Chrome and Firefox. strongThe queries do take from 2 to 12 minutes to be donestrong, and thats the problem. I tried  both polling with Ajax and websockets, but none of them worked the firewall is in the way and I cant tunnel in a proxy it seems.  Any idea on how to keep the page alive while the server is running Thanks. strongPS I cant edit indexes on the Oracle tables, nor alter them in any waystrong. The queries are already quite optimized.  Also, I know Im doing a lot of mistakes plain Java code in JSPs..., yet this is the best I can do for now. Changing the whole logical structure of the code is hard at this point and I just need a painless solution to make everything work.p

Positive 2702 pI am using Protractor to test my code written in AngularJSp  pProbably there is some timeout running in my AngularJS code which is making Protractor wait too long until it times out and gives error.

Might be some library I am using but not sure.p  pIs there a global way to check in Angular how many timeouts are pending overallp  pI am getting this errorp  blockquote   pUncaught exception Timed out waiting for Protractor to synchronize   with the page after 10 seconds.

Positive 2702 pA PHP script which creates one big file needs a couple of minutes to run through when it is called. On my website, this script is called via jQuerys AJAX function. Some of our clients use an internet connection that uses a proxy server. These clients report that the AJAX call returns a 502 Bad Gateway error, because the proxy servers timeout limit was reached. To avoid this problem, I added buffer output functionality to the PHP script and extended the AJAX call so that it receives the current file creation status several times while the PHP script is running. Unfortunately, the buffer output does also only work when no proxy server is used.p  pWhich is the bestmost common way to avoid thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong I have extended the existing AJAX request which waits for the file to be created, so that it checks the potentially thrown error and  when indicated  provides a link to recheck the files existence.

Negative 2702 pMy employer, a small office supply company, is switching suppliers and I am looking through their electronic content to come up with a robust database schema our previous schema was pretty much just thrown together without any thought at all, and its pretty much led to an unbearable data model with corrupt, inconsistent information.p  pThe new suppliers data is much better than the old ones, but their data is what I would call emhypernormalizedem.  For example, their product category structure has 5 levels  Master Department, Department, Class, Subclass, Product Block.  In addition the product block content has the long description, search terms and image names for products the idea is that a product block contains a product and all variations  e.g. a particular pen might come in black, blue or red ink all of these items are essentially the same thing, so they apply to a single product block.  In the data Ive been given, this is expressed as the products table I say table but its a flat file with the data having a reference to the product blocks unique ID.p  pI am trying to come up with a robust schema to accommodate the data Im provided with, since Ill need to load it relatively soon, and the data theyve given me doesnt seem to match the type of data they provide for demonstration on their sample website a hrefhttpwww.iteminfo.com relnofollowhttpwww.iteminfo.coma.  In any event, Im not looking to reuse their presentation structure so its a moot point, but I was browsing the site to get some ideas of how to structure things.p  pWhat Im unsure of is whether or not I should keep the data in this format, or for example consolidate MasterDepartmentClassSubclass into a single Categories table, using a selfreferencing relationship, and link that to a product block product block should be kept separate as its not a category as such, but a group of related products for a given category.  Currently, the product blocks table references the subclass table, so this would change to categoryid if I consolidate them together.p  pI am probably going to be creating an ecommerce storefront making use of this data with Ruby on Rails or thats my plan, at any rate so Im trying to avoid getting snagged later on or having a bloated application  maybe Im giving it too much thought but Id rather be safe than sorry our previous data was a real mess and cost the company tens of thousands of dollars in lost sales due to inconsistent and inaccurate data.  Also I am going to break from the Rails conventions a little by making sure that my database is robust and enforces constraints I plan on doing it at the application level, too, so thats something I need to consider as well.p  pHow would you tackle a situation like this  Keep in mind that I have the data to be loaded already in flat files that mimic a table structure I have documentation saying which columns are which and what references are set up Im trying to decide if I should keep them as normalized as they currently are, or if I should look to consolidate I need to be aware of how each method will affect the way I program the site using Rails since if I do consolidate, there will be essentially 4 levels of categories in a single table, but that definitely seems more manageable than separate tables for each level, since apart from Subclass which directly links to product blocks they dont strongdostrong anything except show the next level of category under them.  Im always a loss for the best way to handle data like this  I know of the saying Normalize until it hurts, then denormalize until it works but Ive never really had to implement it until now.p

Negative 2702 pCurrently were opening a new aspx page with window.open.  The window.open is in a javascript function openNewWindow in the current aspx page which is called when an asp.net hyperlink control is clicked.p  pThe links are dynamically created on the page by our framework and so Id like to avoid changing that functionality.p  pThe problem seems to be that when this new child window is closed, session state is lost.  I should mention that session is available in the child window just not in the parent window after the child window is closed.p  pFunnily enough, it seems that elsewhere in our application, if an open.window call is added to a page by using a ClientScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript call on the codebehind click event of a hyperlink control rather than it calling a function that is coded in the aspx session is preserved.p  pThe latter solution would be difficult to implement in the current framework code without a significant change and all the regression testing that would entail.p  pAnybody got any ideas how to keep the session state alive after the close of the child window.p  pBTW this is occurring in IE7 and our app is asp.net 2.0 based.p  pThanks in advance for your insightful and elegant solutions to this problem op

Negative 2702 pIm very much a novice at MDX, and have no idea how to approach this problem.  Id appreciate any help, even if just pointers to where relevant functions are explained.p  pI need to be able to calculate the ratio of sums, where the numerator is a trivial SUM measure, but the denominator is the sum of dimensionspecific values.  For those knowledgeable of the insurance industry, this is a per member per month calculation.p  pOur time dimension, at the lowest level month, has an associated number of members numeric.  When viewing the month level, our measure is the simple sum of paid amount  members for that month.  Weve got this one no problem by precalculating the ratios as a column in the fact table, and defining a SUM measure on that column.p  pHowever, when viewing any slice above the monthly level, this sum of ratios no longer is applicable.  Rather we need an average of paid amounts.  So if Im looking at a yearly axis, I need to add up the paid amounts for all months, and divide that sum by the sums of the members for each month.  How can I grab the member count for each unique month and add them up  We have a column in our fact table for holding this monthly value, so the needed value is there.p  pPseudoSQL for calculating this denominator would be something like select summembers as denominator from select members group by month.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2702 pI just got a new development box and am having issues getting my MVC project up and running.  My old box had Server 2003 and IIS6.

My new box is running Vista Business and IIS7.  When I copied my app over and tried to run it, I get an http 404 The resource cannot be found. error.  However, if I create a new MVC app and run that, everything works fine.  I also copied the Nerd Dinner app over from my old box and that works fine as well.p  pIve verified that the app is running in Integrated Mode and have compared the web.config files of the working and nonworking apps but see nothing that is different other than application specific appsettings.  I have tried to run the app in Classic Mode with the wild card mapping set, but that does not work either. I have also tried running the app using Cassini, but got the same results.p

Negative 2702 pWhat is your choice for primary key in tables that represent a person like Client, User, Customer, Employee etc. My first choice would be an SSN number. However, using SSN has been discouraged because of privacy concerns and different regulations. SSN can change during person lifetime, so that is another reason against it.p  pI guess that one of the functions of well chosen natural primary key is to avoid duplication. I do not want a person to be registered twice in the database. Some surrogate or generated primary key does not help in avoiding duplicate entries. What is the best way to approach thisp  pEDITp  pWhat is the best way to guarantee uniqueness in your application for person entity and can this be handled on database level with primary key or uniqueness constraintp

I am hoping to index these items but store their index data against the parent doc in Lucene. This should hopefully speed up the search bit, by saving time sorting through multiple results which all effectively point to the same URL. Below is some basic code for the custom indexer I will implement. p  pCan anyone let me know if this is a possible and b a good idea The main issues I see are that the Lucene doc already looks like it has been created  do I need to delete it Also, if the Lucene doc for the parent item does not exist, do I need to create it And will it be overwrittenlost when the parent item is indexed. Looks like a bit of room of conflict there.p  pAnother option is that I dont index child items, but get their values when I am indexing the parent.

Negative 2702 pIm working with some very large files residing on P2 Panasonic cards.

Negative 2702 pDoes anyone know of a way to compare two .NET assemblies to determine whether they were built from the same source filesp  pI am aware that there are some differencing utilities available, such as the plugin for Reflector, but I am not interested in viewing differences in a GUI, I just want an automated way to compare a collection of binaries to see whether they were built from the same or equivalent source files. I understand that multiple different source files could produce the same IL, and realise that the process would only be sensitive to differences in the IL, not the original source.p  pThe main obstacle to just comparing the byte streams for the two assemblies is that .NET includes a field called MVID Module Version Identifier the assembly. This appears to have  a different value for every compilation, so if you build the same code twice the assembly will be different.p  pA related question is, does anyone know how to force the MVID to be the same for each compilation This would avoid us needing to have a comparison process that is insensitive to differences in the value of the MVID. A consistent MVID would be preferable, as this means that standard checksums could be used.p  pThe background behind this is that a thirdparty company is responsible for independently reviewing and signing off our releases, prior to us being permitted to release to Production. This includes reviewing the source code. They want to independently confirm that the source code we give them matches the binaries that we earlier built, tested and currently plan to deploy. We are looking for a process that allows them to independently build the system from the source we supply them with, and the compare the checksums against the checksums for the binaries we have tested.p  pBTW. Please note that we are using continuous integration, automated builds, source control etc. The issue is not related to an internal lack of control over what source files went into a given build. The issue is that a third party is responsible for verifying that the source we give them produces the same binaries that we have tested and plan to put into Production. They should not be trusting any of our internal systems or controls, including the build server or the source code control system. All they care about is getting the source associated with the build, performing the build themselves, and verifying that the outputs match what we say we are deploying. p  pThe runtime speed of the comparison solution is not particularly important. p  pthanksp

Negative 2702 pUsing an alphabet like 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ Id like to generate 2 to 4 letter codes to identify unique datastore entries. I have a python function capable of doing this when passed an list indicating the letter positions of the last code [7,17,11]  7GA. the next code can be made by incrementing that right most element by one and carrying one up when the alphabet length is exceeded.p  pThis method has the advantage of keeping codes short, sequential, consistent, easy to communicate, and looking how I want them to.p  pIm wondering though if this would work on app engine since the function must hold onto or be passed the last identifier to enforce uniqueness which may not play well with the noncontinuous nature of Googles infrastructure.

Negative 2702 pIm looking for a workitemtrackingbugtracking system or JIRA plugin, or TFS plugin, or... which makes it easy to stackrank work items without having to manually assign priority values to each work item.  p  pInstead, our team wants to be able to see a list of open work items and be able to dragndrop one or a multiple selection of work items until the order matches the teams prioritization.  This would be much easier than arguing about priority numbers and dealing with ties e.g. which of the 5 bugs marked priority2 should I work on today. p  pOur team is considering switching workitemtrackers we use a hrefhttpwww.geminiplatform.com relnofollowGeminia now and availability of a good dragndrop prioritizer is high on our requirements list. p  pI realize dragndrop ranking is nontrivial because no team will stack rank emallem work items. Instead, well want to take a subset e.g. work items for one sprint sprint or iteration, or bugs assigned to one developer and stackrank those, then later look at a different subset and stackrank those, etc.  And Im sure well sometimes need to mix and match different stacks, so thered need to be heuristics ideally configurable about how to show a stack of items previously stacked separately. p  pa hrefhttpswww.pivotaltracker.com relnofollowPivotal Trackera is close to the dragndrop UI Im thinking of from a UI perspective, but Pivotals model of separating user stories from the underlying work items plus a few other issues doesnt match how we want to work.  We dont want to have to deal with different artifacts stories vs. JIRABugZilla work items instead we just want a dragndrop UI to automatically fill out a priority field in the issue tracker, and which we can use later when sorting and filtering.  And we wouldnt want to use Pivotal as our only work item tracker, because it seems to lack common features like bulk editing which are critical for large projects. p  pAnyone know of a tool like what I describe abovep

Had coworker compile the project from her machine and bug is still there in XP only.p  pTake the notifyicon component off the form and everything works again in XP. I tried putting a notifyicon on other .NET 2.0 projects and they work so Im not sure why just this project has issues.p  pOn the XP machine I tried .NET 2.0 SP0 amp .NET 2.0 SP2 with still the same issue. Strange...p

Negative 2702 pThis question maybe not related to Emacs only, but to all development environment that use Console for its debugging process. Here is the problem. I use Eshell to run the application we are being developed. Its a J2ME application. And for debugging, we just use codeSystem.out.printlncode. And now, suppose I want to allow only text that started with codeEkocode to be displayed in the console interactively, is it possiblep  pI installed Cygwin in my Windows environment, and try to codegrepcode the output like this  coderun  grep Ekocode. It surely filtered only output with codeEkocode as the beginning, but its not interactive. The output suppressed until the application quit. Well, thats useless anyway.p  pIs it possible to do it What I mean is, we dont have to touch the application code itselfp  pI tag to linux also, because maybe some guys in Linux know the answer.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 2702 pDuring early development of my game I did not really regard how the game will be paused in case the player gets interrupted.  I figured it shouldnt be anything too difficult so I left it as something I would look into once I got the core of the game finished.p  pIm here now and trying to figure out a way to pause my game is very difficult, from my point of view anyway.p  pAs of now I followed a few tutorials to get to where I am today, mainly tutorials from a hrefhttpasgamer.com relnofollowASGamera.  The preloader and menu screens tutorial that can be found at that site is what I used and so far Ive had a few problems which I will ask later.p  pAnyway I find it difficult to wrap my head around how I would be able to pause or suspend game play when the user presses a designated key.  I guess I should explain how my game functions.p  pI have 3 frames in my main timeline.p  pFirst frame is for the preloader, simple.p  pSecond frame is where the game is.  It has my asset holder and all my scripts run when on that frame.p  pThird frame is stop action.p  pOnce the preloader finishes my the Menu Screens starts, this is the tutorial I followed.  It loads and unloads movieclips with UnLoad and Load.p  pI use Load to load the main menu which happens at the beginning, then use UnLoad to unload the current menu then load the next designated menu, for example Main Menu  the Game I use codeUnloadnew GameMenustagecode The stage is constantly passed back and forth with these menus so it gets confusing sometimes.p  pIn the GameMenu is where I run the game from, I made a class GamePlay that extends MovieClip.  From there it spawns the players and enemies and plays as a normal game, this is where my problem begins.p  pFirst I tried to create a key handler to get key presses from the user.  At one point it worked the key presses were registering but after I made some changes to other scripts the key presses were not recognized any more.  So I moved the key presses to my Main.as which is the main script that my fla uses.  The keyboard events work fine, but now actually stopping the game...how do I even begin  I would have to stop all movieclips and eventlisteners until the user presses the designated pause button again, how would I accomplish thisp  pI read somewhere that using state machines is the best bet for having a pause in any game, but Im not sure how to do this but Im sure there are tutorials and blogs I can read to make a state machine, but if I did add one or make one would I have to redo all my code to accommodate state machinesp

Negative 2702 pI am currently reading Martin Fowlers UML Distilled. I have just covered the section on class diagrams, where he places strong emphasis on the need to sort out ones perspective before modelling class diagrams. However, I am slightly confused as to how this looks practically when actually drawing class diagrams. I understand that the theoretical implications change the meaning of an association from one perspective to the next for example.p  pI guess my main question would be that if for example I was modelling a simple ordering system like he does in the book, would the class diagrams look different and contain different amounts of notation from one perspective to another. For example, from a conceptual perspective would I just show the classes and some vague associations and their multiplicity and then when modelling at the specification perspective include navigability and basic class operations and fields.p  pI would really appreciate some guidance on this as I would really like to have a better grasp of this subject. p

This 2D image needs to be downsampled using bilinear interpolation to a grid of size PxQ P and Q are to be configured as input parameters e.g. lets take PxQ is 8x8. And assume input 2D array image is of size 200x100. i.e 200 columns, 100 rows.p  pNow how while performing downsampling using bilinear interpolation of this 200x100 image, should I first obtain a downsampled image of size 100x50 downsampling by 2 in both dimensions using bilinear interpolation then a 50x25 imageagain by doing downsampling by 2 in both dimensions, then a 25x12 image, then a 12x12this time doing downsampling by linearnot bilinear interpolation only along the rows, and finally drop some pixels to get 8x8. Any pointers to exact algorithm or different ways to achieve this, are appreciated.p  p2.Above question raises another one  how to downsample using bilinear interpolation by a noninteger scale factor, e.g. how to go from a say 8x8 image array to a 6x2 image wherein resamplingscaling factors in both dimensions are not integers.p  p3.Then when I get a 8x8 sized image I need to upsample it by bilinear interpolation to the same original size I started with MxN. If I need to go from 8x8 to say 20x20. How would it interpolate in between points in a row and would it interpolate a full row by some means. Again in case of noninteger scale factors how would bilinear interpolation for upsampling happen. Exact steps.p  pAnd finally I need to implement this in C.p  pI tried visualizing these particular questions by taking different examples, but not got a clear picture of how this bilinear interpolation would happen while downsampling and upsampling. All I have is plenty of paper sheets havingdots and crossed pictures on my desk, but still no clear solution p  pAny detailed reading material, books appreciated. p
Negative 2702 pI have a data flow task within SSIS 2008 that pulls about 2,000,000 rows with an OLE DB source, then goes onebyone through 24 lookup transformations replacing code data with either its predefined equivalent from a dimension table, or an unknown value.  p  pThis onebyone process, with the entire flow running through each transformation has become a major bottleneck in the execution of the package and I need a way to speed up the process.  Any ideasp  pIve tried to multicast the data set to each of the 24 different lookups so that only the necessary column is sent to it but when I then run them all into a union all the task seems to not like the various data types and tends to throw errors no matter how I configure it.  Is there another option Im missingp

Negative 2702 pThe default behaviour for a ListBox used in a WP7 application is for the selected item to be highlighted in the PhoneAccentBrush.  I am finding that with a ListBox that when I handle the SelectionChanged event sets a property and closes popup that contains the ListBox I never see the text color change to the PhoneAccentBrush  so the user never gets any feedback that they have selected the correct item.  Is there a way to work around this and give the user feedback even though it will only be momentary as to which item they have selected.p

All of them are used in strongsomestrong test scenario.li liThis makes it quite hard for a beginner to understand how to configure a test so Im trying to build a test configurator wizard that set up a test scenario without forcing the usertester to edit all config files manually. li liThis wizard will collect the relevant files from a repository and put them in a folder where the Grinder Console can present them to the user.li ulli ol  pSo, the way I use to find out which files are used by Grinder is to use AOP AspectJ to capture all calls to codejava.io.FileInputStreamjava.io.Filecode from any code in the codeorg.python.utilcode and codeorg.python.corecode packages. The advice I apply to these joinpoints is to print the file name to codeSystem.outcode. I use loadtime weaving for this, so I can run the groovyjavajython code with our without  AOP enabled. The codeAttributeErrorcodeproblem occurs regardless if I have AOP enabled or not.p  pI have a vague suspicion that the codeAttributeErrorcode problem could be caused by some classloader mismatch when a groovy class executes the PythonInterpreter methods, but Im far from sure about this.  Im not sure if groovy is doing any kind of strongruntime bytecode editingstrong when it loads classes and if that confuses the PythonInterpreter. p  pThe groovy code itself is precompiled so I use the regular java.exe to launch the process.p
Negative 2702 pI have a few forms in a web2py shopping cart that I built from scratch.  Most of the time the forms are working fine but once in awhile on submission a form will neither submit and redirect to the next page of the cart nor return any form errors as it usually does when there is a form error.p  pInstead it simply refreshes the page and clears the form.  Whats really frustrating about this bug is that the same user will have this bug and when they try again with the same browser and same data it will work fine. p  pIn fact, none of my team has been able to reproduce it but three of our users have reported it so Im inclined to think something is wrong.p  pOne thing the forms all in common is that they all add session as an argument for form.acceptsp  precodeif form.acceptsrequest.vars, session codepre  pPerhaps if something was screwy in my session it might cause this behavior  Although when I looked in the gluonsqlhtml web2py file it didnt seem to use session for much of anything.p  pThe various forms and models are all very long so before posting all of that code, I was wondering if anybody simply had some thoughts on what might be causing this andor could point me in the right direction.p  pIll be happy to post any part of the code that would help shed some light on the matter.    Let me know, thanks.p

Negative 2702 pId like to store the version number of my library in just one place. So I have defined such a variable in the CMakefilep  precode    SETLIBINTERFACEVERSION 1 CACHE INTEGER Version of libInterface codepre  pWith this definition I can generate a version.rc file according to Microsofts definition, which I compile into the library and afterwards shows up correctly in the properties window of my dllfile.p  pNow Id like to use this CMake variable in my c source code too, but I actually dont get to a working solution. Ive tried different things like thisp  precode    ifndef VERSIONLIBINTERFACE       define VERSIONLIBINTERFACE LIBINTERFACEVERSION     endif codepre  por thisp  precode    unsigned int getLibInterfaceVersion              return LIBINTERFACEVERSION      codepre  pBut the compiler wont accept anything. Since my researches in the CMakeDocumentation didnt get any results, I hope that someone could give me the essential advice.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2702 pI code mostly in Java and use Maven for all of my projects. I do really love using Maven since it is easy to download the sources and documentations, and, more importantly, I dont need to keep the copy of the external libraries under my project source code folders.p  pI have started to develop an Android application and I found that the Android plugin for eclipse are terribly good. However, all provided examples are not maven projects so I do not know whether, if I use maven, I would still get all the functionalities from the Android plugin or whether there is any drawback from using Maven.p  pSo the questions arep  ol liDo all features from Android plugin for eclipse still workli liIs it going to be more difficult than using the normal build I believe it is Ant but not certainli liAny other drawbacks, e.g. the file size of the final application Maven tends to bundle a lot of things together or the difficulties of getting the latest libraries on maven repository which is probably differnt for Android.li ol  pPlease do not point to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4015036mavensupportforandroidprojectsmaven support for android projectsap  pI would like an answer from experience developers.

Negative 2702 pIn my current SpringJSF project I need integrate a method to push server side updates Preferably as they happen to the web based GUI to be displayed to the clients.p  pSo to get started with things, I am working on this small application to get a feel of how DWR works.Basically, Ive developed two variations to implement the server side push.p  pIn the first approach, when the find button is pressed the back end updates are properly displayed.This makes a calls the findInstrumentSymbols method in the InstrumentManager and returns the output as a List Objects through DWR.p  pIn the second approach I attempted to implement the reverse ajax approach suggested in the DWR webs site.a hrefhttpdirectwebremoting.orgdwrdemoreverseajaxpeopleTable.html relnofollowhttpdirectwebremoting.orgdwrdemoreverseajaxpeopleTable.htmlap  pHow can make this functionality available as the default functionality every time a page loads without having to specifically activate it through a buttonp  pIn this implementation I was unable to return the output as a List Objects through DWR as in the first approach and had to be sent as a string array.I see that the new results are not populated properly as in the first approach and it tends to looses the new data when the Disable button is pressed.How can this required reverse server push functionality be properly achieved using DWRp  pI have listed the code fragments below.I Would really appreciate any pointers on getting the revers Ajax functionality to operational.p  pI have used polling as as described in earlier DWR releases.What method would be most ideal to implement reverse Ajax functionality if switching to DWR3 is the way forward p  pstrongWeb.xmlstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltwebapp idWebAppID version2.5     xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaee httpjava.sun.comxmlnsjavaeewebapp25.xsdgt      ltdisplaynamegtAdminConsoleltdisplaynamegt     ltcontextparamgt         ltparamnamegtcontextConfigLocationltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtWEBINFapplicationcontext.xml         WEBINFapplicationsecuritycontext.xmlltparamvaluegt     ltcontextparamgt     ltcontextparamgt         ltparamnamegtjavax.faces.DEFAULTSUFFIXltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegt.xhtmlltparamvaluegt     ltcontextparamgt     ltcontextparamgt         ltdescriptiongtState saving method client or server default.

Negative 2702 pIve got a site a hrefhttpabc.comsupport relnofollowhttpabc.comsupporta, which uses an iFrame that has a source pointing to a hrefhttps123.sample.com relnofollowhttps123.sample.coma My objective was to mask the domain and the iFrame accomplishes this successfully. However, I just found out that users are not able to log into the site using IE 9source a hrefhttps123.sample.com relnofollowhttps123.sample.coma when they go through the iFrame.

Negative 2702 pI think Im on the right track using OSGi services  DS together, however, I really feel like abusing it. Either that, or its just pure awesome. Both is still possible.p  pSo lets imagine the following application its a house database. I have two interfaces, House and Window. Lets say I have at least one implementation for each available, configured as a ...well, as a component which requires a configuration to instantiate, and in order to create new instances I just supply this configuration to the right pid. Its not a factory component, nor a service factory either  whats the official name Heres an excellent a hrefhttpnjbartlett.name20100719factorycomponentsinds.html relnofollowpost about ita by Neil.p  pSo far so good, this works like a charm.p  pHouses are just that, houses. Have their own address, each one is different, easy to identify by their street property. However, windows instances are sharable between houses their configuration is basically width and height.p  pNow, these component can also bind to each other in a 0..n cardinality configuration even if you wouldnt want to live in a house with no windows. So each house has a list of windows, and for each window type, we know which house has it a ManytoMany relationship.p  pMy problem is, lets say two houses share the same three windows. How can I describe this I feel like property based filtering is not expressive enough. I also feel like maybe this is not the right way to get the framework to instantiate my objects, but its just so handy.p  pThoughts Am I abusing, or using it as intendedp  pI could also use DS to just get the half of the job done bind either a list of Houses to a Window instance references by it, or vica versa, and then the component instance could call a registerWhatever function on the target instances  but then I still need to describe at least this half somehow.p

Then repeating the same process to generate a CSS file of all classes .V0 to .V99 and all classes .H0 to .H99 .

Negative 2702 pIm doing some automated testing using c, nUnit, Selenium WebDriver amp Firefox.p  pIm running into a problem with the Security Warning Popup Although this page is encrypted, the information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.p  pI want to disable this in Firefox, so that my testing isnt hindered.p  pIm seeing conflicting reports on the internet of whether or not this is possible. I have tried changing Firefox security warning settings using aboutconfig but I still cant get rid of the popup popup still shows when using WebDriver or manually using Firefox.p  pAny solutions to this would be greatly appreciated as Ive lost over 2 hours of my life on this.p  pA solution to stop the popup from happening or closing it automatically from WebDriver would be equally good.p

Negative 2702 pI am writing a program which is used to launch different command line applications. The problem is when I run 1 application, command prompt takes control of the program and will not allow me to access my GUI to launch another. I believe this is because codeSystemcode creates a new process, Then once the command prompt is exited, control is given back to the GUI.p  pIs there any alternatives that will allow me to Launch several command line programs at once  like in a thread for example.p  pAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.p  pDanp

Negative 2702 pI am trying to get a better understanding of the interfaces in C and other OOP languages.  What does an interface do Why is it needed  I know c and Java do not allow multiple inheritance. Most books say interfaces are the one way to get around the single inheritance restriction and allow different classes to have a common functionality. Interfaces just define the methods and forces the classes to implement them. Why not have the class define and implement methods itself without dealing with an interface For examplep  precode4 using System 5 6 public interface IShape 7  8    double Area 9    double Circumference 10   int Sides 11  12 13 public class Circle  IShape 14  15    public int x 16    public int y 17    public double radius 18    private const float PI  3.14159F 19 20 public double Area 21  22    double theArea 23    theArea  PI  radius  radius 24    return theArea 25  . . . codepre  pWhy cant the Circle class define and implement the Area, Circumference and Sides methods itself If a square class inherits the IShape, the Circumference methods will have to be unimplemented. Am I way off in my understanding of interfaces p

Negative 2702 pI was recently tasked with loading a portion of my Rails application within an iframe on another website. The relevant pages should be using a different layout file, but only if theyre being rendered inside of the iframe. There was a solution proposed here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6908813detectiframerequestinarailsappDetect iframe request in a rails appa    that involved passing a query string parameter. p  pFor example the requesting website could call my application through an iframe with the src of codehttpfoo.combariframetruecode. Then in our controller we could simply checkp  precodedef bar   render template gt iframe if params[iframe] end codepre  pThis seems like a good solution, but sadly that only works for the initial request as the original query string is completely static. Assuming we have accessible links to other routes within the iframe is there any way of easily relaying the codeiframetruecode request parameter to maintain the correct iframe layout without having to repeat code Basically I would like to take the DRYest approach possible without breaking any existing functionality. I considered creating another linkto helper which included the logic to relay this parameter if it exists and replacing all of my linkto calls throughout my application I was wondering if anybody had a better approach though.p

Negative 2702 pI am looking for ways to implement filesystem operations using php with transaction support. Like if I am performing operations like move, copy and delete inside a transaction, if one of them fails, the script needs to revert all those operations already performed. I am kind of clueless and am seeking guidance how it can be achieved. And if available libraries or solutions exists I apologize if the question sounds vague.p

Negative 2702 pI have a method to determine the most compatible person for every other person. Basically there are two nested loops over the items of a dict that maps from a person to a list where similar lists determine compatibility, there compat is computed and saved if it is bigger then the previously maximal one for the person of the outer loop. br  So I decided to optimize performance by updating the compatibility for the other person the on in the inner loop as well, because the compatibility is the same, and I wont have to do the same computation when the outer loop reaches person 2 and the inner one person 1 [use symmetrie of compatibility relation].br  Well, I ended up strong20 times slowerstrong. The cprofile logs are strange, because all operations of the improved version have a better or similar totaltime than the ones in the unimproved code. So Im absolutely stuck finding the bottleneck.  br  strongCan anybody give me advice on how to interpret this logs Where is the evil instruction gonestrong p  plog of normal codep  precode      python

Negative 2702 pSorry, struggled a bit thinking up a title.p  pBasically, I have a piece of code which reads a value from a comparator on my embedded board 8051. This will be a value from 0255, where 0 is 0V and 255 is 5V.p  pI need to output these values to a set of eight LEDs, each assigned a bit on variable P1, in human readable fashion IE like a level meter. Hence, the input value must be rounded so that anything from 16 up to 32 is output as 1, 33 to 48 as 2, 49 to 80 as 4, 81 to 112 as 8 etc. p  pMy only solution that I know will work so far is a string of ifelse statements, but I got two layers deep before realising that its just not going to cut it.p  pDoes anyone know how to accomplish this My brain has turned to mush trying to work out how to do it mathematically.p  pThanks Joep  pEDIT Heres a snapshot of my calculations, I hope that makes it a bit clearer. a hrefhttpi.imgur.comr3n8Ila.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comr3n8Ila.pngap

Negative 2702 pIm trying to put together a form and work within the ASP validation framework if possible. Recently it seemed prudent to rethink some of the validation and so I got rid of four validators and replaced them with one codeCustomValidatorcode. Now I have two codeCustomValidatorcodes previously I had one codeCustomValidatorcode and four codeRegulorExpressionValidatorcodes.p  pSo heres the weird thing. One of my custom validators was somehow showing the error messages from the validators I deleted. Ive actually double checked and confirmed that the codestringcode it is displaying is no longer in the project. Nor is it anywhere in the directory Im deploying to. Ive built, cleaned, and rebuilt.p  pFurther, this did not appear to be a browser cache issue as I have the cache turned off FF Web Developer. The problem would also change based on where I placed the validator in the page again verifying that this was not some bizarro cache issue.p  pI was finally able to resolve it by content inside of the validator tag.p  pSo this worksp  precodeltaspCustomValidator         IDvalidateUrl         OnServerValidateValidateWebsiteUrl         ClientValidationFunctionisUrlValid          ControlToValidatewebsiteURLInput         ValidationGroupCommentGroup         runatserver          ForeColor991112 gtPlease enter a valid URLltaspCustomValidatorgt codepre  pBut this failsp  precodeltaspCustomValidator         IDvalidateUrl         OnServerValidateValidateWebsiteUrl         ClientValidationFunctionisUrlValid          ControlToValidatewebsiteURLInput         ValidationGroupCommentGroup         runatserver          ForeColor991112         ErrorMessagePlease enter a valid URL gt codepre  pAs does this no error messagep  precodeltaspCustomValidator         IDvalidateUrl         OnServerValidateValidateWebsiteUrl         ClientValidationFunctionisUrlValid          ControlToValidatewebsiteURLInput         ValidationGroupCommentGroup         runatserver          ForeColor991112 gt codepre

Each table consists of 400 records. So it takes around 60.45 per table to grab the data from the server and add it. Since I have 5 tables it takes around 5 minutes. Is there a better way to achieve efficient syncing for what I am doing After I grab the data from the server, instead of truncating the table Ive tried checking if it exists firsts before adding it but that didnt help with the time.p  pWhat I am currently doing I get the JSON list from the API server and truncate the table and add the rows back.

Negative 2702 pI got a macro that has a table with the first row being the name for that table and all the subsequent rows are print screens pasted. What the macro does is that when a new print screen is pasted the image is resized to a specific size and is added a border of 050pt. p  pI was asked that the border be applied to text For example img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1FXie.png altenter image description herep  pWhat I did on the image was select the whole table with the little cross on the upper left hand corner, right click on the mouse, select Borders amp Shading option and finally format my border like so .5pt Box single line style.

However, the problem occurs when I add one single line of code. I get linker error that the function I added has already been defined in an object file. Im using Visual Studio 2012 Premium as compiler. I have tried to remove any existing function from the header file, and that also goes through the compiler. On the other hand, if I add any new line that may be new to the compiler, it refuses to compile saying it has already been defined. Does anyone have any clue what might be wrong or can I have stumbled upon an error inside the compiler itself which I highly doubt Edit The solution was to declare the function the the header file, but to define it in the CPP file. But the real issue was that when I include a header file for returning an object of the type declared in the header file, it does not compile. It many of the errors Missing  in front of  which was types declared in other header files.p

However, some items have constraints  e.g. there can only be 6 grenades in the inventory.p  pWe arent allowed to use instanceof. So we implemented a visitor pattern which adds the grenade to our Inventory and we used a different list for grenades than for the other items.

Negative 2702 pIn my Wicket application I have a page refresh problem. If a user clicks on f5 on certain pages, the application will act unexpectedly.p  pMost object are refreshed to their original status.

Clicking the button of the previous example would act as a finish button, and not as a send button. p  pWhat I would like, is to refresh everything if a user presses f5 like ctrlf5, so its like the user hasnt done anything on the page yet.

Negative 2702 pI am currently working on a project where we would like to use the a hrefhttpsgithub.comFodyPropertyChanged relnofollowFody PropertyChangeda IL weaver. It appears to work fantastically, but it is doing strange things to our a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb42947628vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowFxCopa analysis built into visual studio. p  pWe have a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms182182.aspx relnofollowCA1062a and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms182331.aspx relnofollowCA2214a enabled The former validates arguments of public methods and the latter checks for calls to overridable methods in constructors.  p  pThe second one, we have figured out is due to the fact that we are also using Caliburn.Micro which supplies a method called codeNotifyOfPropertyChangedcode which is virtual. This is a simple fix of changing the method to not be virtual. p  pThe first issue is much harder and seemingly random. We have been hard core about validating our arguments from the get go and did not have any FxCop analysis errors before Fody, but when I added it through NuGet FxCop was seeing changes in places that shouldnt have any weaved code for property changed. I even looked at a diff of the decompiled source before and after Fody, and there are FxCop conflicts in places where methods werent changed at all.p  pSo my question is whether I can somehow postpone Fody weaving till after the analysis is finished, or if there is some other way to get Fody and FxCop to interact nicely p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2702 pI have a workspace w1, w2, w3 and w4. Using Ruby scripts, i added a workspace admin user to w4. In my spreadsheet, i only had one row for the same. After i ran the scripts, apart from giving permissions as workspace admin to w4, i see that this user is also given a user access to W1 and viewer to the project underneath it.  If i create a No Access entries for this user corresponding to w1, it still behaves the same unless this No Access row is at the end of the spreadsheet.  Once i added the No Access entry for this user corresponding to W1 as the last row in the spreadsheet with the first row being admin corresponding to W4, then running the ruby script creates the permissions as i wanted which is admin to workspace W4 only. Is this the expected behaviour or am i missing anythingp

Negative 2702 pi want to store more than 5mb in the client browser. The Browser can be Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari iOS or Windows Phone 8 Browser. My first thought was about localStorage as it is already implemented in the mentioned browsers.p  pAs a bonus feature it should be possible to save more than 5mb on special browsers. Therefore i first check the browser engine and then select the best saving method. I only need to store key  value pairs.p  pif i try the code below i wrote it never or extremly late on chrome. iPhone works webSQL except iOS 7. In iOS 7 is a known browser bug which crashes the DB.

Negative 2702 pIm currently hosting my files on a local server while i build my site. I have my files organised in a way such as thisp  precodeimages     image1.jpg     image2.jpg about     index.html codepre  pI want the index.html file to be codemywebsite.comaboutcode, but when I click the link to it, it goes to codemywebsite.comaboutcode, with a slash on the end like so.

Negative 2702 pIm trying to implement an open button such that if a user presses it and holds, a menu of applications for the user to choose from will pop up but as soon as the user releases the mouse, the menu should disappear. if the user releases the mouse without choosing an application on the menu, it should open the file with the default application. Im implementing this button as a codeQToolButtoncode and connect the signals as followsp  precodeself.uiopenbtn.pressed.connectself.onOpenBtnPressed self.uiopenbtn.triggered.connectself.onOpenBtnTriggered  def onOpenBtnPressedself     self.uiopenbtn.showMenu  def onOpenBtnTriggeredself, action     applicationname  action.text      code to launch the application codepre  pRight now, when the user presses the button, the menu will pop up. However, the menu is still there when the user release the button, and action on the menu is triggered by clicking on it. I tried under both codeDelayedPopupcode and codeInstantPopupcode mode. As long as the menu has been set for codeself.uiopenbtncode, I can no longer catch any codereleasedcode signal. How can I hide the menu when the user releases the mouse How can the action on the menu be triggered by releasing the mousep  paddedp  pI found another problem about using codeQToolButtoncode the menu always pops up when the button is pressed. Instead, I would like to catch the codepressedcode signal, do some check to determine if the menu should pop up or not. So I changed my approach to write my customized toolbutton by subclassing codeQPushButtoncode and codeQMenucode. Please see my code posed in the answer below.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2702 pI have a security DVR that uses h264 streams.  I have been trying to get this to work with zoneminder.  I have successfully logged into the dvr and recieved some form of data streams.  The data stream is dumped to a fifopipe, and then zoneminder uses ffmpeg to read this in. p  pNote  i know very very little about h.264 streams.  just enough to be stupid.p  pThe video only updates about every 15 seconds in ZM.  I can dump the stream to a file with ffmpeg or avconv avconv i tmpmypipe cam.mp4 but it is still not right.  However, the file created by avconv is WAY WAY better than the one created by ffmpeg.p  pIve included a link to the wireshark dump I did change the PW and login info, etc....  From the data, It appears that the dvr is adding a header to the h264 data streams.  I understand that the h264 stream starts with a 0x00 00 01 67 or 0x00 00 01 61.  Here is an example of the header plus start of streamp  precode0x33, 0x30, 0x64, 0x63, 0x48, 0x32, 0x36, 0x34,  0x3f, 0x55, 0x00, 0x00, 0x08, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00,  0xa2, 0x7a, 0xea, 0xdc, 0xcf, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00,  0x0d, 0x0a, 0x11, 0x07, 0x13, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00,  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x67, 0x42, 0xe0, 0x14,  0xdb, 0x05, 0x87, 0xc4, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01,  0x68, 0xce, 0x30, 0xa4, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  0x01, 0x06, 0xe5, 0x01, 0x51, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00,  0x00, 0x01, 0x65, 0xb8, 0x00, 0x01, 0xa8, 0xac, codepre  pI can see that there are a few frame indicators in this message.  The DVRs header appears to be 32 bytes long in this case, and in some other messages in the dump, it appears to be 24 bytes long.  I am striping the header off before I dump the stream to the pipe. I have verified the output doesnt include the dvrs headers in any way.p  pWhat I would like help with is determining what I should be sending to the pipe.  should I start with the first h.264 key  Is there something out of order  Im very surprised that ffmpeg is only getting 15 second updates, but avconv is much better lots of dropped frames, and playback is sped up.p  pusing ffmpeg to read the pipe produces a file that shows its codec as  H264  MPEG4 AVC part  10 avc1 with a Decoded format  Planar 420 YUV using vlc.  p  pAppreciate any help you can providep  pa hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu7515347MPouttest1chopped.pcap relnofollowWireshark h264 dumpap  pedit on Ubuntu 13.04 ffmpeg version   60.8.61ubuntu2 avconv 0.8.660.8.61ubuntu2p

Negative 2702 pIm working on a simple 2D game, rendering via the Java2D API. Ive noticed that when I try to draw on integrated graphics card the performance crashes.p  pIve tested this game on both my main rig with a newer ATI Radeon and my 5 year old laptop which also has an incredibly antiquated Radeon. On both I get good FPS, but when I try to use my Intel i5s onboard HD 4000 graphics, it crawls at around 20 FPS.p  pIm using Full Screen Exclusive mode.p  pAt any given moment, I am rendering approximately 1000 images at once.p  pAnnoyingly, when I try to getAvailableAcceleratedMemory it just returns 1 for this card, and it seems to refuse to accelerate any images.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas how to fix this issuep  pRendering codep  precode    Graphics g  bufferStrategy.getDrawGraphics     g.drawImageimg, x, y, img.getWidth, img.getHeight, null     g.dispose     bufferStrategy.show codepre  pImage Loading codep  precode    BufferedImage I  null     I  ImageIO.readnew FilecurrentFolderimgPath     imgMap.putimgIdentifier, I codepre  pThe images are stored in a hashmap of BufferedImages identified by strings, so when an entity needs to draw and image it just gets it out of the hashmap and draws it.

Negative 2702 pI am trying to generate some traffic to a server by sending TCP messages to it. For this, I am using a Python script which opens a TCP socket and then sends some data over it. After receiving a reply, the TCP connection gets closed.p  pQuestion I would like to be able to predefine a rate with which the script will be sending the requests to the server, eg 5 messages per second. However, I do not have a clue how to script this via Python .p  pAnyone an idea how to do this a short example would be super   p  pThanks in advance.p  pNote I might need to add an extra difficulty since the server has to reply, I guess I have to make the script working asynchronously ... That way, I can send the requests out without having to wait for a reply on the previous request...p
Negative 2702 pI need to duplicate  a table row  in a RTF file.

In this case ltlt[QL]p  p2  This row has two cells.p  p3  I then search backwards from this to find the trowd control characterp  p4  From this point I search backwards again to find the start of the group i.e. p  p5  Then from my tag ltlt[QL I search for the end of the row. The row control characterp  p6  From this point I search for the closing  of the group p  p7  I then copy this string as the row templatep  p8  I then create another string by appending by duplicating the row template , for each appending I change irowN and irowbandN with the next number i.e. irow1p  p9  I also check if there is a control character lastrow if it is not the last row I remove this.p  p10 I now expect this string to have four rows of data.p  p11 I duplicate these by replacing the row template with 4 of these i.e. appending this row template 4 times p  p12 I then write back the file contents.p  pWhen I open the RTF file I get an error and the repair tool indicates an error of Table endofcellmarkers p  pMy row template looks like this p  precodertlchfcs1 af0 ltrchfcs0

Negative 2702 pI released an Android app a year or so ago.

Negative 2702 pI built a basic web app using Flask, and was able to run it from a virtual machine using its native http server. I quickly realized that with this set up, requests are blocking I couldnt make concurrent requests for resources any new request would wait until earlier requests had finished, and decided to try gunicorn to run the app to solve this problem.

Negative 2702 pI am working on an application wherein I have to connect to different database depending upon an customer id that is passed from the client side. The schema for all the databases is same. It is a kind of multitenant application. Since I dont know how many customers will be there, I cannot use xml configuration to statically create the datasources, hence I have to create datasources manually.p  pWe are using Spring JdbcTemplate for connecting to the databases and the connection parameter comes from another database which holds the configuration for the application. I am able to connect to the databases properly, but the method calls are not happening in a transaction. Following is the code snippet which does the database connectivity for only one database and  I was going to extend it for multiple databasesp  precodeBasicDataSource datasource  new BasicDataSource  set database connection params ....  create jdbcTemplate,  jdbcTemplate  new JdbcTemplatedatasource  create transaction managers PlatformTransactionManager txManager  new DataSourceTransactionManagerdatasource codepre  pMy idea is to create the transaction manager manually and somehow bind it in the spring container so that all the methodsclasses with Transactional annotation can use this transaction manager. I am not able to figure how do I bind the txManager, so that all the methodsclasses with Transactional will use this transaction manager. I am not sure whether this is the right way and should I be creating a transaction manager for every datasource, since, I dont want the transaction to span multiple databases, but I want that every service method call should be in a transaction. Note All my service classes have Component and Transactional annotation.p  pAm I solving the problem in the correct wayp

Negative 2702 pIm having problems understanding how to get an codeNSTextViewcode to limit the width of the page when displayed and printed.

TextEdit.app does essentially what Im looking to achievep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgamro.png alttexteditp  pHowever, with my application, I dont get the behaviour at all, especially in relation to images embedded within the text view. For example, when I embed a large image, the image will simply be cut off if the window is too small, but when the window is resized large enough, it will render in its full size, but the text view does not constrain the content to the width of a pagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9AQdR.png alttext view small img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBEU45.jpg alttext view largep  pThis, of course, results in some strange results when printingfor example, the image is simply cut offp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE3sX4.png altimage cut off printp  pWhen resizing the window, its immediately apparent with both centred, rightaligned or justified text that the text view isnt constraining its width to a certain number of centimetres, as indicated on the ruler.p  pHow would I go about limiting the width of the codeNSTextViewcode when printed I dont care about margins or rendering it as multiple pages in the UI although I would not mind it, but want to make sure the content of the text view is no more than the pages width when printing, according to the size set in the Page Setup panel. To clarify the user interface can have the text view as wide as it wants, I just require that when printed, its horizontally fit to a page so nothing is cut off.p  pI have looked throughout the documentation, and tried several things, such as codeNSTextcodes codemaxSizecode value, but to no avail.p

Negative 2702 pI know you should normally use sharedptrs and weakptrs to make circular references solve themselves, but I found a different approach is working for my usecase and wanted to know if the following is ok or not and if it has any mayor disadvantages.p  pBasically, I implemented a doubly linked tree like sop  h3TreeNode.hh3  precodeclass TreeNode public     TreeNode     TreeNodesharedptrltTreeNodegt parent     void addChildTreeNode private     sharedptrltTreeNodegt parent     vectorltTreeNodegt children  codepre  h3TreeNode.cpph3  precodeTreeNodeTreeNode       parentsharedptrltTreeNodegtnullptr,     childrenvectorltTreeNodegt       TreeNodeTreeNodesharedptrltTreeNodegt parent      parentparent,     childrenvectorltTreeNodegt       TreeNodeaddChildTreeNode child     child.parent  sharedptrltTreeNodegtthis     children.pushbackchild  codepre  h2My thoughsh2  pBecause I know that a codeTreeNodecode always has to have a parent except for the root, of course, the reference counting of codesharedptrcode seems irrelevant to me, as a parent will always outlive the pointer to it its children contain, so I might even use raw pointers at this point. Also, I dont need pointers for the children because templating with incomplete types is allowed.p  h2My questionsh2  pem1.

Negative 2702 pIm using Visual Studio 2013. I had a strongprojectstrong using the strongASP.NET Web Forms Applicationstrong template and published it via filesystem. It worked fine and the pages were displayed the same whether I started it from VS or accessed it on the published server.p  pUnfortunately I was not happy with all the additional files and pages which were created with the template I only need one .aspx and no login or mobile version. Because there were errors when I started deleting the additional files and pages, I decided to create a new project and copyamppaste my written code. This time I created a strongNew Websitestrong from the strongASP.NET Empty Web Sitestrong template.p  pI copyamppasted what I already had and worked on it for quite a while also many css changes. I always tested it via the builtin browser testing from Visual Studio and all looked fine. Now I published the website to the same server from before and out came a page which seems to block every css and javascript and onyl showing plain html.p  pI think that the reason is because the server requires all pages to be accesses by https I cannot turn it off even though it would be a solution.p  pDo I have to somehow configurate my websiteproject to be runnable on a https serverp

The control isnt that big, perhaps it contains 1012 children. Usually, I just type it up directly in the page xaml, as it isnt reused anywhere.

Negative 2702 pIve got a CortexM4 based MCU linked to a FPGA via a 16bit parallel memory bus interface. In essence the FPGA behaves like an external memory mapped to the memory space of the MCU the MCU presents an address followed by either a data word write or reading the word presented by the FPGA read. p  pI want to protect both read and write against transmission errors both during addressing and data writeread. However, I dont expect many bit errors since the distance between both parts is short.p  pI can easily implement checking and generating of either parity, hamming codes or CRC inside the FPGA. However, doing the same checking and generating in the uC seems comparatively harder since I dont want to cripple the throughput. Without error detection, reading and writing of 16bit words takes around 46 processor cycles and is thus rather fast. Consequently I dont want to spend hundred of cycles on protective measures.p  pstrongIn the end I am looking for a moderately efficient error detection method for 16bit data that is implemented in a uC in as few cycles as possible.strongp

Negative 2702 pI have a problem that Task manager on device claims that my app uses incredible amounts of memory. Numbers like 400MB or even 600MB are common. Dont understand why it shows numbers like that as there is nothing in the app that could make it go into such numbers.p  pSo I read Google docs about memory management, I read tons of other tutorials. My app  should be fine, but I went to investigate further by monitoring memory with DDMS. After monitoring the heap there it shows numbers mostly around 40MB allocated with 70MB heap size, so much less that what devices Task manager claims.p  pI also made heap dumps which I analyzed with MAT and again numbers around 40MB are shown there too.p  pSo why do devices claim that much more memory is used than what Eclipse memory tools show to me Am I to believe what Task manager shows Did anyone have problems like this and more importantly what is the cause of thisp

Negative 2702 pI have following problemp  pIn my code, I dynamically create forms as strings and insert them into the DOM using JQuery. Specifically, there are elements that you can right click to customize them using the forms mentioned. After the user inputs his customization options, I serialize and store his inputs as well as the whole string of the elements form. Now, if the user wants to customize the element again, I want the form to show the inputs that the user already saved, e.g. text fields should already hold the value that the user typed in. Is there an easy way to do this For example, is there a way to store the whole html with value attributes set to what the user typed in, a radio button having the checked attribute etc of a formp  pSo far I tried to get this done by using string.replace , but as I create the forms dynamically, I dont know in advance how many radio buttons etc theres gonna be so its hard to get this right.p

Negative 2702 pI have a model class codeProductcode in which I am storing generic things related to a product like name, owner, price, image and type. Here the type attribute represents the category of the product and it is used for determining the other factors associated with this product. p  pNow I have several classes which have attributes related to different categories of a product.  So lets say I have a class codeShoesInfocode which have additional attributes related to shoes like shoe color, show type sports shoes, running shoes, etc. This class contains a foreign key to above class.p  pI have to split the details page in two parts. In the first part it will fill all the generic info the fields in the codeProductcode class and the type. So according to the type he has entered, I have to show the additional fields in the form.p  pMy question is how to do this at runtime. When a user enters a value in type, the additional attribute fields should appear in the django admin form.p
Negative 2702 pI stumbled across polymorphic engines and I dont know anything about them. However, I am curious about how they are written. Every example that Ive looked up writes them in assembly, my assembly is not good at all I know just a few instructions here and there but not that well. On the other hand, I am good in C and C.p  pI am familiar with the concept of polymorphism in C but after reading about polymorphic engines, I am assuming that they are different from the polymorphism in C.p  pHow can techniques such as using codevirtualcode keyword in C be used to obfuscate or encrypt the code in an applicationp
Negative 2702 pI am using codeangularjscode in conjunction with codeuiacecode, a library that has a directive for the popular codeacecode library.p  h2a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularuiuiace relnofollowuiaceah2  h2a hrefhttpace.c9.ionavabout relnofollowace text editorah2  pI have made some modifications to the directive because I need it to work with codestring[]code, instead of normal strings.

Negative 2702 pI have a summing criteria that is based on the length of the reference cell. For example if the data isp  precode     A  B  1 1.1  1    2 1.2  0.5  3 1.21 3    codepre  pI want to sum the column B values if the corresponding cell in column A a text column has a single decimal i.e. length 3. For example LENA13 is true, LENA23 is true, but LENA33 is false, so the sum should be 1.5.p  pSince it seems its not possible to do something like the followingp  precodeSUMIFA1A3,LENA1A33,B1B3 codepre  pI set out to do this with an array formulap  precodeSUMB1B3LENA1A33 codepre  pThis works fine for this simple test case, but the real data has blanks or more specifically, cells that are set to  by another formula. The internet suggests using PRODUCT to multiply while ignoring blanks, but PRODUCT also ignores logicals. I tried casting my logicals to integers, which works finep  precodeSUMPRODUCTB1B3,INTLENA1A33 codepre  pHowever, in my real case, the condition argument to INT is an AND statement. When looking at evaluation of this formula with the formula debugger, it looks like the AND statement receives two arguments, both of which are logical arrays, but collapses them to a single logical rather than an array of logicals.p  p...so now Im stuck. Is there any way to write a formula for a conditional sum where The condition refers back to the reference cell so I cant use SUMIF The condition is complex requires AND, so array formulas are out The data contains blanks requires PRODUCT instead of p

Negative 2702 pWe have a project for windows store app using WinRT and XAML, C.

I have of course DEBUG configuration with full symbols set in Project Properties  Build  Advanced  Debug Info.p  pAt first I thougth that it must be something in our project.

Negative 2702 pI am having a hard time understanding why the following code stops working altogether.  Basically when I try to hide and show an nginclude using ngshow from the parent scope it works fine.

When you hit the Cancel button that is in the nginclude, the variable createItemVisible from the parent scope that controls visibility is somehow corrupted.p  pIve read through many other posts on parent scope but I never saw a mention of where it works once and then not again.p  pThe plnkr is here a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit1tNpTzEBnTRHgvx6o0dcppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedit1tNpTzEBnTRHgvx6o0dcppreviewap  pHere is the index.html codep  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMainCtrlgt lth3gtItemslth3gt  ltbutton typebutton classbtn btnprimary ngclickcreateItemgtCreate New Itemltbuttongt ltbutton typebutton classbtn btnalert ngclickcreateItemVisiblecreateItemVisiblegtToggleltbuttongt ltbutton typebutton classbtn btndanger ngclickcreateItemVisiblefalsegtCancelltbuttongt  ltdiv ngincludeinlineform.html ngshowcreateItemVisiblegtltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pHere is the inlineform.html codep  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerItemDetailCtrlgt   ltbutton typebutton classclose ngclickcancelItemDetailgtamptimesltbuttongt   lth3gtNew Itemlth3gt    ltbutton ngclickcancelItemDetail classbtn btndangergtCancelltbuttongt ltdivgt codepre  pHere is the scriptp  precodevar myApp  angular.modulemyApp, []  myApp.controllerMainCtrl, functionscope     scope.createItemVisible  false    scope.createItem  function      scope.createItemVisible  true       myApp.controllerItemDetailCtrl, functionscope     scope.cancelItemDetail  function      scope.parent.createItemVisible  false      codepre

At that time, if we want to avoid using any ObjC related stuff, should we avoid using optional protocol requirements and protocol checks conformance in our codep  pIf so, whats Swifts idiomatic way of achieving similar patterns without using codeobjccode E.g., a delegate with optional methods.p  hr  pFor example, this simple use case cannot be implemented with noncodeobjccode protocols and codePrintablecode, codeDebugPrintablecode and codeStreamablecode are noncodeobjccodep  precodeimport UIKit  let firstName  John let lastName  Appleseed let age  33 let height  1.74  let values [Any]  [firstName, lastName, age, height] let stringifiedValues  [String]  for value in values      if let pritanbleValue  value as Printable              stringifiedValues.appendvalue.description          else if let debugPrintableValue  value as DebugPrintable              stringifiedValues.appendvalue.debugDescription          else if let streamableValue  value as Streamable              var string           streamableValue.writeToampstring         stringifiedValues.appendstring           etc.         else               stringifiedValues.append[NoStringRepresentation]       codepre
Negative 2702 pI found a similar question for this same assignment but that person was using  a different type of loops. I have been struggling with this assignment and even with the teacher giving me pseudo code to try to explain it further I am still having difficulties with it writing out what its supposed to in the end.p  pWe are supposed to create an array that holds the price of theater tickets, then make a html table that has the different level of tickets and prices that correspond with the numbers in the array. After this we prompt the user for their name and validate that they did enter something. Then we are supposed to create a function named numSeats that prompts the user for the number of  seats that they want to buy and validate that they entered a number and the maximum number of seats they can buy in one transaction is 6.p  pWe are supposed to use a loop to  prompt the user until they enter a valid number, then create a function named seatingChoice that prompts the user for where they would like the seats to be by indicating the correct number from the table.p  pseartingChoice also needs to validate that they entered a number 14 and use a loop to prompt the user until they enter a valid number. If the user at any time hits the cancel button in a prompt we are supposed to  give an alert of Sorry you changed your mind. This is missing from my code because i havent figured out how to do that.p  pWhen the program calculates everything and writes to the screen in the end it is supposed to write like UsersName ordered tickets for a total of dollaramt but instead it writes Null ordered null tickets for a total of null. The following is what i have the the javascript part of the codep  precodevar Prices  [60, 50, 40, 30] var Usersname  promptPlease enter your name whileUsersname  null  Usersname  promptPlease enter your name   function numSeats   var seats  promptPlease enter the number of seats you want to buy parseIntseats whileseats  nullseats gt 6      seats  promptPlease enter a number between 1 and 6      parseIntseats      return seats     var seatswanted  numSeats   function seatingChoice   var choice  promptPlease enter where you would like your seats to be located by indicating     the correct number from the table parseIntchoice whilechoice  nullchoice gt 4      choice  promptPlease enter a number between 1 and 4, corresponding to your section choice     parseIntchoice  return choice  var seating  seatingChoice  var dollaramt  seatswanted  Prices[seating1]    document.writeUsersname   ordered   seatswanted  tickets for a total of      dollaramt  . codepre

Negative 2702 pWe have software written in Python, which uses JPype to call Java, which performs various resource heavy calculations  report building. We originally assigned 800mb of heap space when starting the JVM.

The new machines are Win 7 64bit with 4GB of RAM, whereas the old ones are Win XP 32bit with only 2 GB of ram.p  pThe issue is that JPype causes our application to ungracefully and silently crash if we allocate too much memory. A try catch doesnt even get triggered on the statement above.p  pIm wondering if theres a way to use java from command line to determine how much memory we can allocate on a computer. We can check if its 32bit or 64bit which helps, but we need to make sure they arent running other programs taking up heap space on the JVM. If they are, our application will crash.p  pReaders Digest Wed like to allocate 500mb of heap space when initializing the JVM, but cant be sure of how much space is currently being used.

Negative 2702 pIn Sublime Text 2 or 3 I use both, and the answer is probably the same for both, how do you change the hotkey of an installed pluginpackage on Windows or Linux  Ubuntup  pI already know how to change the key bindings of builtin Sublime commands Preferences  Key Bindings. For instance, one binding I already have isp  precodekeys [ctrlsuperb], command showpanel, args panel output.exec codepre  pBut in the case of a plugin, how do I know what string to use for command Is there an easy way to find out what the command is for an arbitrary function in Sublimep  pI would like a general answer that applies to any plugin one could install. Though as an example, today Im trying to change the hotkey for a plugin called SimpleClone, which has assigned kbdCtrlkbdkbdShiftkbdkbdRightkbd to Split Right. kbdCtrlkbdkbdShiftkbdkbdRightkbd is a rather poor hotkey choice by the maker of the plugin since it already has a use in the operating system when typing it selects the word to the right. Hence I want to change the assigned key binding.p

Negative 2702 pIm getting this very odd behaviour with my strongscroll viewstrong. Its a paging strongscroll viewstrong set up in iOS 8 using auto layout. The screen so far is very simple, just some labels and a strongscroll viewstrong. There are three pages. p  pThe set up is a strongcontainer viewstrong in which a strongscroll viewstrong sits. The strongscroll viewstrong contains a content view which gets it size from the container and its width is 3 times the size of the container view, giving a scroll view with 3 pages of content the size of the container view. p  pBounce is off, paging is on.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0jJgZ.png altenter image description herep  pThe scrolling doesnt seem strongchoppystrong  Ive experienced this with codeUITableViewcode before and I know what scrolling looks like when the phone is struggling to produce a good frame rate, I dont think its like that.p  pIts almost like the whole strongscroll viewstrong is stuck in treacle. Or as if someone added some codeUIDynamicscode or some kind of spring behaviour to the scroll view at the ends of the scrolling as its about to page its unusually slow, no matter the intensity of flick to scroll. p  pIve attached a video to show you what I mean.

Negative 2702 pIm setting up a custom controller to extend MageCoreControllerFrontAction. If a user adds an item to the cart, I want to check the quote lifetime. If it is old enough, then the user should be given a new quote. Nothing needs to be done for younger quotes.

We arent worried about any orphaned quotes, we just want the old quote duplicated into a new one, giving us a brand new quoteId.p  pIn the CartController.php, I can get the current quoteId and the items inside withp  precodecurrentcart  MagegetSingletoncheckoutsession quoteid currentcartgtgetQuoteId  olditems  thisgtgetQuotegtgetAllVisibleItems codepre  pBut I dont know how to check for the quote lifetime i.e. current time minus the last quote update, nor do I now how to initialize a brand new quote.

Negative 2702 pI have a scene Im rendering using OpenGL ES in Android using the Java libs. I want to apply some effects such as depth of field to the scene. I found a nice bokeh shader, and it needs a depth texture to do the job. What I need then, is to generate a depth texture to pass to the shader. Ive been poking around the internet for a day and a half trying to figure this out, and cant seem to find a good example of how to generate a depth texture from an existing scene. It seems I need to do several passes, probably using an off screen render to a frame buffer, then generate a depth texture from that to pass to my bokeh shader to actually render the scene.p  pHow do you generate a depth texture A good working example would be much appreciated.p

Negative 2702 pSo here is my issue. Every month, I get a list of about 3000 names. I take these names, and import them into a db. Although, what is happening, is some of these names have special characters in them. ie, ,. Using the replace function seems extremely tedious, as I have to enter in each line. However, I have used this code in the past, but I can only get it to work with a button. But I need it to work with a macro, so I can just run the macro from the original downloaded names excel sheet.p  precodeFunction removeSpecialsInput As String As String     Dim sSpecialChars As String     Dim i As Long     sSpecialChars  ltgt     For i  1 To LensSpecialChars     sInput  replacesInput, MidsSpecialChars, i, 1,       Next     removeSpecial  sInput End Function codepre  pAs I will need to replace all the accented letters with their corresponding letter  with A, and  with u, this code makes it easy to run all those separate functions, by entering what I need in just 1 entry, instead of making a new entry for each character.p  pAlso, I have been running each batch as a separate function. How would I group them together to run as 1 functionmacrop  pAny way to do this Or is there another code I can use inplace of this one My knowledge is pretty much google. I have spent a few days trying to figure this one out, and eventually said screw it... il ask you guys.p

Negative 2702 pAssalamualikum Everyone I am making a comment panel just like Google plus app does. I am using a drawer layout and a pulltorefreshlibrary  a hrefhttpsgithub.comnaverandroidpulltorefresh relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnaverandroidpulltorefresha  inside that drawer layout to show comments. Then I have added another feature on that listview that is when I swipe in other direction delete button appears with animation to delete any comment.  My problem is that when I swipe to open delete button on any row, drawer layout do not closes unless I swipe on listview items particularly. If i swipe below items of listview it does not closes the drawer layout. I have added touch event on listview and set its height to fill parent in order to fix this issue but touch event is only detected on listview items not below the listview. So I can not close delete button below the listview.p  pThe code snippet below is the code of my comment binder  classp  precode  To animate view slide out from top to bottom     public void

Negative 2702 pIm trying to implement 2opt optimization for finding good enough solutions to the TSP, with no edge crossings.

In some runs with 1000s of cities there remain several crossings.p  pCode notes solution is a List. Rather than creating a new tour and calculating the entire distance the code computes the difference between the two edges removed and the two edges created for speed.

Negative 2702 pI understand the process of memory allocation for C programs. According to what I got from the internet, for C compilers, memory are allocated for the global variables and static variables at compiling time. While dynamically created variables such as newmalloc operations will be given space in the memory only when the executables are actually running. Correct me if I am wrong here. p  pSo is it true that if the executable is never executed, then the part of memory previously allocated at compiling time for global amp static variables will still and always sit there in the memory until the computer is shut down What if we shut down the PC, and reboot it, then reexecute the executables This time, there is no compiling process, when does the OS allocate memory for the global amp static variables of this program Is it in the system booting phase, or when the executable is actually executedp  pNow extending this question to any general program in the PC. For example the Microsoft Word program. We did not code and compiled it by ourselves, we just installed it from its installation package, thus there is no compiling process in this situation or maybe the installation process is actually the compiling process. Suppose these general programs also need space in the memory for staticampglobal variables, when does the OS allocates memory for these programs Is it when we power up and boot the OS, or when we actually execute the executables of these programs If the OS preload all these static variables at boot time, that kind of explained why the OS booting process takes some time, but it seems to be a waste of memory resource if 90 of the programs installed in the system will not be executed each time the user powers up and use his PC.p

What happens is the followingp  pEverything is normal until and including codemidiStreamOutcode. I can hear the midi output. The playback length is correct. However, the event callback is never called when the playback ends.p  pAt this point the value of codeMidiHeader.Flagscode is code0xecode, indicating that the stream is still playing even though the callback has been notified with the message that playback has finished. The value of codeMidiHeader.Flagscode should be code9code, indicating that the stream has finished playing.p  pThe call to codemidiOutUnprepareHeadercode fails with the error code code0x41code Cannot perform this operation while media data is still playing.  Reset the device, or wait until the data is finished playing.. Note that resetting the device, as suggested in the error message, does in fact not fix the problem neither does waiting or trying it multiple times.p  pAnother variant that works correctly is if I use codeIntPtrcode instead of coderef MidiHeadercode in the signatures of the C declarations, and then manually allocate unmanaged memory, copying my codeMidiHeadercode structure onto that memory, and then using the allocated memory to call the functions.p  pFurthermore, I tried decreasing the size Im passing to the codeheaderSizecode argument to 32. Since the fields are reserved and, in fact, didnt exist in previous version of the Windows API, they seemed to have no particular purpose anyway. However, this does not fix the problem, even though Windows should not even know that the array exists, and therefore it should not do anything. Commenting out the array entirely yet again fixes the problem i.e., both the array as well as the 8 codeReservedcode fields are commented out, and the codeheaderSizecode is 32.p  pThis hints to me that the codeIntPtr[] Reserved2code cannot be marshaled correctly, and attempting to do so is corrupting other values.

Negative 2702 pOthers have asked similar questions, but their data structure was a bit different. My data set has multiple columns for both grouping variables and numeric data. I need to sum the numeric data per row and output the sum to a new data column. See example codeDATAcode set and the desired codeRESULTScode tables below. I prefer to find a solution using the codemutatecode function in codedplyrcode. I primary use the codedplyrcode package to manipulate my data sets. I can accomplish this task via codegathercode, codegroupbycode, and codesumarisecode functions in codedplyrcode, but I am working with very large data sets which can cause gathered data tables to be in excess of 2,000,000 rows.

Negative 2702 pI have a table in MySQL which contains both signed and unsigned integer columns. When I created them in phpMyAdmin, I only selected the data type codeINTcode and set the codeUNSIGNEDcode attributes on the unsigned columns. I left the length field empty.p  pHowever, when I view the table in structure view, the unsigned fields are displayed as codeint10code, while the signed fields are displayed as codeint11code, which makes no sense, as unsigned types can store positive numbers which are double the size of the ones that could be stored in a signed type.p  pI tried finding the reason for this, but I was unsuccessful. Is this a bug in MySQL or in phpMyAdmin, or is it intended behaviour If it is, why sop

Negative 2702 pMy program launches a helper program using fork  execvp and Id like to show the helper programs output in my programs GUI. The helpers output should be shown line by line in a listview widget embedded in my programs GUI. Of course, I could just redirect the output to a file, wait until the helper has finished, and then read the whole file and show it. But thats not an optimal solution. Ideally, Id like to show the helpers output as it is sent to stdout, i.e. line by line, while the helper is still working.p  pWhat is the suggested way of doing thisp  pFrom the top of my head, what comes to mind is the following solution but Im not sure whether it will work at all because one process will write to the file while the other is trying to read from itp  p1 Start the helper like this using execvp after a forkp  precode.helper gt tmpfile codepre  p2 After that, my program tries to open tmpfile using open and then uses select to wait until theres something to read from that file.

Heres what I have so far.p  pGame.javap  precodepackage com.game.main  import java.awt.Canvas import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.image.BufferStrategy import java.util.Random import java.util.Random  public class Game extends Canvas implements Runnable      private static final long serialVersionUID  5420209024354289119L      public static final int WIDTH  1000, HEIGHT  WIDTH  12  9      private Thread thread     private boolean running  false      private Random r     private Handler handler      public Game         handler  new Handler         this.addKeyListenernew KeyInputhandler          new WindowWIDTH, HEIGHT, Game, this         final int[][] map  DSAlgorithm.makeHeightMap10, 45, 200          r  new Random           handler.addObjectnew PlayerWIDTH2  32, HEIGHT2  32, ID.Player         handler.addObjectnew World0, 0, ID.World         int squareSize  10         forint y  0 y lt map.length ysquareSize             forint x  0 x lt map.length xsquareSize                 int value  map[x][y]                 handler.addObjectnew TerrianTilex, y, value                                 public synchronized void start         thread  new Threadthis         thread.start         running  true           public synchronized void stop         try              thread.join             running  false          catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace                    public void run         long lastTime  System.nanoTime         double amountOfTicks  60.0         double ns  1000000000  amountOfTicks         double delta  0         long timer  System.currentTimeMillis         int frames  0         while running             long now  System.nanoTime             delta  now  lastTime  ns             lastTime  now             whiledelta gt 1                 tick                 delta                            if running                 render             frames              if System.currentTimeMillis  timer gt 1000                 timer  1000                 System.out.printlnFPS   frames                 frames  0                               stop           private void tick         handler.tick           private void render         BufferStrategy bs  this.getBufferStrategy         if bs  null             this.createBufferStrategy3             return                   Graphics g  bs.getDrawGraphics          g.setColorColor.black         g.fillRect0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT          handler.renderg          g.dispose         bs.show           public static void mainString args[]         new Game           public static int randIntint min, int max         Random rand  new Random         int randomNum  rand.nextIntmax  min  1  min         return randomNum        codepre  pWindow.javap  precodepackage com.game.main  import java.awt.Canvas import java.awt.Dimension  import javax.swing.JFrame  public class Window extends Canvas       private static final long serialVersionUID  1478604005915452565L      public Windowint width, int height, String title, Game game          JFrame frame  new JFrametitle          frame.setPreferredSizenew Dimensionwidth, height         frame.setMaximumSizenew Dimensionwidth, height         frame.setMinimumSizenew Dimensionwidth, height          frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.setResizablefalse         frame.setLocationRelativeTonull         frame.addgame         frame.setVisibletrue         game.start       codepre  pDSAlgorithm.javap  precodepackage com.game.main  public class DSAlgorithm              This method uses the seed value to initialize the four corners of the       map.

Now I am kinda stuck, and couldnt find a solution. Of course thats something I can do iterating the result and removing the results I dont need. But I am trying to figure out if it is possible to achieve this SQL query I mentioned using the Django queryset API.p

Negative 2702 pWhen I try to use SharpDX to dump or display a shared DirectX10 Texture2D created in C, the first line of pixels within the texture appears but the rest of the texture is black. p  pI expect the entire texture to display.

Negative 2702 pThis question is simple, apparently, but I cannot find a solution for hours.p  pI have a Winforms project in C against .NET Framework 4.5 in VS 2012. p  pI have a class that exports to Excel CreateExcelFile from a hrefhttpwww.mikesknowledgebase.com relnofollowhttpwww.mikesknowledgebase.coma.

Negative 2702 pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpmatlabmatlaboopcontrollingthenumberofinstances.html relnofollowMatlab documentationa, for creating the Singleton design pattern you need to set a codepersistentcode variable inside a static function for your singleton object instance, i.e.p  precodeclassdef Sealed SingleInstance lt handle   methods Access  private     function obj  SingleInstance     end   end   methods Static     function singleObj  getInstance       persistent localObj       if isemptylocalObj  isvalidlocalObj         localObj  SingleInstance       end       singleObj  localObj     end   end end codepre  pIt is almost impossible to destruct the singleton instance. Ive tried codeclear SingleInstancecode, codeclear getInstancecode, codeclear SingleInstance.getInstancecode, codeclear functionscode, codeclear variablescode, and other combinations. The only way for the codelocalObjcode persistent variable inside the codegetInstancecode static method of the codeSingleInstancecode class is calling codeclear allcode.p  pIm OK with calling codeclear allcode prior to calling my Matlab OO application. However, Im using Matlab unit test infrastructure, and there are unit tests where I would like to test different ways of instantiating the singleton classes. However, for that I would need to call codeclear allcode, which would make the Matlab unit test infrastructure to stop working.p  pDoes any one knows a way to cleaning persistent variable inside static methods of Matlab classes without calling codeclear allcode Or, in other way, does any one knows how to implement the Singleton design pattern without using codepersitentcode variables Or, at least, how calling codeclear allcode inside unit tests without breaking the unit test infrastructurep
Negative 2702 pI have a DataGridView which allows the user to set a value in multiple rows simultaneously by first selecting several rows and choosing a value from the context menu.  I acheive this by iterating over all the selected row setting the appropriate column of each row to the values specified.

Is it possible to suspend reordering till iterating is complete, or is there another way of ensuring each of the selected rows is modified exactly oncep  pEdit By the way, setting the columns SortMode to NotSortable doesnt seem to help.p  pAs inp  precodeDataGridViewColumnSortMode temp  dgv[currenttab].Columns[column].SortMode dgv[currenttab].Columns[column].SortMode  AataGridViewColumnSortMode.NotSortable  foreach DataGridViewRow row in dgv[currenttab].SelectedRows      row.Cells[column].Value  F   dgv[currenttab].Columns[colour].SortMode  temp codepre  pAs cumbersome as it is it still has the same problem.p

Negative 2702 pI am wondering how I might go about using the codeReactiveCocoacode library to codeRACcodeify codeUIApplicationDelegatecode lifecycle events.p  pSince the most important one is code BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptionscode, that seems like a logical place to start to me.p  pThe basic idea, if I understand correctly, would be to create a codeRACSignalcode that would encapsulate the event application finished launching with these options, send it either serially through a pipeline or in parallel to multiple application start handlers and then merge all of their outputs  if serially, then only continue when each returns codeYEScode, if parallel, codeif handler1  YES ampamp handler2  YES ...code  and then codereturncode the combined response in the actual codeUIApplicationDelegatecode.p  pHowever, I am fuzzy on the precise details of how this would be accomplished  which is probably evident from my line of questioning.p  pAny examples, either in real code or just pseudocode, would be greatly appreciated. It would for me and probably others serve a dual purpose 1 the stated one, and 2 provide an example of how to codeRACcodeify a nonUIdriven event well, thats not even exactly true, but I think you see what I mean.p

Negative 2702 pI work for a middleware company. We would like to integrate Cppcheck into our build system to help preventing errors and issues in our code. Our code is big, and its distributed in several modules each module in a different folder. These modules have many dependencies between them.p  pWhen running cppcheck, we want to run it only once over the whole code to give the whole view to the tool. However, some modules are not related to the core ones, and we want to skip those modules from the analysis. Besides, we have implemented APIs for different languages. So for example, we have some modules for C that we would like to analyze separately from the C modules.p  pWe have basically two options 1 call cppcheck with a list of the modules that we want to analyze, or 2 call cppcheck from the top level folder of the code, and use i options to ignore all the modules that shouldnt be analyzed.p  pBoth approaches worked fine up to the point of creating the XML report. The problem appears when calling cppcheckhtmlreport. We observed that no index.html or stats.html were generated. Besides, only some of the results appearing in the XML were translated into HTML reports. For many results, the HTML pages were not generated. p  pAny memory problem can be discarded. We already verified this. Besides, the tool doesnt start creating HTML reports from the XML results consecutively and then it stops. Actually, what happens is that the HTML reports go jumping. I mean, the HTML report for error number 1 in the XML is created, then maybe next one is number 5, and so on.p  pWe called cppcheckhtmlreport with sourcecode option pointing to the top level folder of the code. I think the problem may be caused by this. I tried to call cppcheck just from the top level folder, with no i options, and then the HTML reports were generated without issues. So it looks like the XML created by using i options cannot be correctly understood by cppcheckhtmlreport. Is there a way to provide i options to cppcheckhtmlreport as well I think this could solve the problem...p  pI have also noticed that the problem only seems to appear when many modules and code is analyzed. When analyzing only a few modules the HTML report was correct, although we still called cppcheckhtmlreport providing the top level folder as sourcedir.p  pIs this a known issue in cppcheck HTML generator Is there any way to solve this  Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks, Soniap
Negative 2702 pSay I have class called MyClass as followp  precodepublic class MyClass       Identifier is alphanumeric.

Negative 2702 pEssentially, I am trying to build a booking system. The booking table shows the bookings for an entire week, and the user can switch between weeks.p  pIn PHP, I have a function getbookingtable which returns the html for the booking table, based on an input which week and booking availabilities from mysqlp  precodeltphp   function getbookingtableweeknumber      retrieve various data from mysql database, return html string    codepre  pI am then loading this html for each week into a JS array, so that the table for each week can be loaded quickly when the user changes week.p  pMy problem is that the HTML string being returned from the PHP function is very long, which I have read is bad practice as well as being clunky for me to handle. The only way I can think of to avoid this is to instead create a 2D array for the booking table for each week, somehow pass this into JS code, and then generate the HTML code from the JS 2D array. However, this seems even more overly complicated. p  pWhat is the correct way to create a dynamic HTML table in PHP and load it into JSp

Negative 2702 pThis might be too vague for SO. I need a simple example of a class that is both an codeIObserverltTgtcode and an codeIOservableltTgtcode. T are actually the same type.p  pcodeOnNextcode will create an codeIOBservableltTgtcode sequence itself. Although, codethiscode should be prevented from observing itself. In essence the observer part is subscribing to multiple observables, and aggregating their values and then in turn serving that aggregation to other subscribers of it.p  pIs it as simple as inheritingimplementing both codeIObserverltTgtcode and codeIOservableltTgtcode Or am I thinking of composability in the wrong way here p  precodepublic struct T    public class ObserverAndObservable  IObserverltTgt, IObservableltTgt   codepre  pWhat I would like to achieve is something like this. Imagine I have a list of oribiting satellites, each are owned by different nations of the world. I would like to subscribe to say, the US onesor whatever combination is useful then compute their average GPS positions. p  precodeSatellites are constantly emiting realtime data ListltSatellitegt satellites IOBserverltSatellitegt observer  satellites.ToObservable  IDisposable observable  observer.Wherex gt string.Equalsx.Name, USSatellite.Subscribe  Now, compute the GPS average of the Satellites.  This is not very fluent. There is probably a way to compose these functions using a lambda at the end to do the computation, which in turn can be subscribed to by other IOBservers... codepre

Negative 2702 pI am creating a line chart to show sales prospecting data.  I have 4 sets of values Monthly Revenue at 100 confidence, Monthly Revenue adjusted to actual confidence , Yearly Revenue at 100 confidence, and Yearly Revenue adjusted to actual confidence .

The RunningValue is working perfectly, but I would like the line to end at the end of the year or series, rather than plateauing through the rest of the graph.

Negative 2702 pI have a Xamarin.Forms xaml page in which I am using a ListView to allow the user to pick a single item out of a list. I have bound the ListViews SelectedItem property to a property on my ViewModel and this works fine. As soon as the user changes the selected item the property in my viewmodel updates as well.p  pHowever, even though I initially set the property in my ViewModel to one of the values from the list, when the page loads the ListViews SelectedItem property is null, which in turn sets the ViewModel property to null as well. What I need is the other direction, I want the ListView to initially select the item that ive set in the VM property.p  pI can hack together a solution by writing extra code in the code behind file to explicitly set the initial selected item, but this introduces additional properties and complexity and is quite ugly.p  pWhat is the correct way to set the initial selected item of a ListView whos selected item is bound to a viewmodel propertyp  pEDITp  pI was asked to provide the code that Im using for my binding.

Negative 2702 pIve got a quite small and straight forward question, Ill would like to get a sure answer for, and thank you guys in advancep  pInside a method  say the main for instance , I can add curly braces  for any section of the code to scope some lines as locals.p  pHeres my examplep  precodepublic static void Main string[] args  int a  1   int b  2 Console.WriteLineb    Console.WriteLinea    codepre  pThe variable int b is obviously nonaccessible in the out side of the curly braces, now my question is about this variables memory position, is it going to be in the same stack frame with the main method in the same stack of memory, or its going to be held in yet a newer stack frame on top of the main methods stack like called methods parameters and local variables inside another methodp

Negative 2702 pFor my list I have a .setOnItemClickListener on an item which takes the user to a different page, and I also have a .setOnItemLongClickListener for the same item which deletes the item from the list. Clicking the item and having it go to a different page works fine, the problem is when I do a long click, it fires up both the .setOnItemClickListener and the .setOnItemLongClickListener which is what I do not want. On a long click I just want it to do what I set it to do under the method NOT also activate the regular click. Ive tried it on an actual devise not just the emulator and I get the same problem. Any help on how to fix the problem is appreciate. p
