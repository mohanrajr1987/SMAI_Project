Positive 794 pIm setting up Vagrant on a university network. I dont want to use a public network as the university network is quite strict about what can connect. Id rather use a private network. p  pThe problem is, when using a private network Vagrant seems to create a network adapter on the machines, something the students dont have permission to do. Is there any way to set up the private network in such a way that it doesnt require administrator privileges on the machinep  pThe machines are running Windows 7, and the vagrant box is using Virtual Box with a Linux guest.p
Positive 794 pIm an amateur web developer thats trying to learn lower level networking concepts, and Python. In order to enhance my skills and knowledge, I want to write a simple Python program that allows me to kick people out of my network.p  pI got the inspiration to try and do such a thing from a program I had on my old Android cellphone, called WifiKill. I found a hrefhttpandroid.stackexchange.comquestions21080howdoeswifikillactuallyworkthis post on SOa, in which the way that it does what it does is explained. p  pSo far, I have a simple script that opens up a GUI and lists the devices and their local IP addresses on my network. I have no idea how to send these devices the ARP packets. Ive read quite a bit on ARP, but so far Im still not fully getting the concepts. p  pMy question is, how do I even get started I want to write all of this on my own, with nothing but the help of native modules. Would the codesocketcode module be of any helpp  pI guess that what I need help with here, specifically, is sending specially crafted raw packets to a device on my network. I have no networking code whatsoever, other than using the Windows codearp acode command to fetch the devices. Im not even sure if thats the next step to take, or if theres even something like being able to send raw packets with Python. I just want a hint in the right direction.p  pIm on Windows, although ideally Id like to make this work on Linux too. But I just want to get started on Windows.p  pThanks.p

Ive found these articlesp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11029129cansquidrunbehindnginxCan squid run behind nginxap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15696908rewritenginxhostandproxypasstosquidRewrite nginx host and proxypass to squidap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19497620nginxdoesntpassrequesturifieldtosquidNginx doesn39t pass RequestURI field to SQUIDap  p...which were helpful, but still couldnt give me a working solution.p  pUp to this point Ive installed a hrefhttpnginx.orgen relnofollowNGINXa and a hrefhttpwww.squidcache.org relnofollowSquida. NGINX is successfully routing my web traffic already. As for Squid, Ive managed to configure my web browser to connect successfully with my server via Squid to handle proxy traffic, and I can browse the web just fine. But I want to do this at the network level via my router so I dont have to do this for all devices multiple computers, tablets, phones, media streamers, etc..p  pCurrently, my NGINX file looks like thisp  precodeupstream squid      server 127.0.0.13128       server        listen xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx80       listen []80       servername sub.example.com       location               proxysetheader XRealIP remoteaddr             proxysetheader Host host             proxypass httpsquidhosturi             proxypass httpxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx3128             proxyredirect off             codepre  pxs represent my actual IP address p  pIve tried to remove the comment hashes for the upstream section, and switching the proxypass statements, but both basically have the same effect.

Positive 794 pI know how to adjust the adapter binding order in Windows so that LAN is preferred over wireless, and remote access connections are preferred over either.

Positive 794 pAs I read in ICDN1 books about Flooding Framesp  pSwitches will flood unknown unicast frames when it can not find MAC address in MAC table. It means it is going to forward the frame out off all interfaces to build a correct MAC table. But I dont understand why switches also forward broadcast frames.p  pThis is the passage in the ICDN1 bookp  pFlooding Framesp  pNow again turn your attention to the forwarding process, using Figure 66. What do you suppose the switch does with Freds first frame in Figure 66, the one that occurred when there were no entries in the MAC address table As it turns out, when there is no matching entry in the table, switches forward the frame out all interfaces except the incoming interface using a process called flooding.p  pSwitches flood unknown unicast frames frames whose destination MAC addresses are not yet in the address table. Flooding means that the switch forwards copies ofthe frame out all ports, except the port on which the frame was received. Ifthe unknown device receives the frame and sends a reply, the reply frames source MAC address will allow the switch to build a correct MAC table entry for that device.p  pstrongSwitches also forward LAN broadcast frames, because this process helps deliver a copy of the frame to all devices in the LAN.strongp  pFor example, Figure 66 shows the first frame, sent to Barneys MAC address, just going to Barney. However, in reality, the switch floods this frame out F02, F03, and F04, even though 0200.2222.2222 Barney is only offF02. The switch does not forward the frame back out F01, because a switch never forwards a frame out the same interface on which it arrived. p  pThank you for reading this.p

Positive 794 pim in a bit confusion out there, i obviously know that P2P peer2peer is used for file sharing. and i have heard that Skype application is using P2P for its communication, i mean like if a host want to do a video chat it goes through P2P protocol in Skype app, i obviously am not sure about that, but i heard of it in YouTube and some website around the web. so my question is that would P2P make a client inside a private network access another network client being private either.  to be precise, i want a host from a private network access a files from another private networks host. like myself access a file from my neighbors network files. am i going to be able to use P2P there hope that do not make any confusion.

Positive 794 pHi i am trying to send packets of 1 kb from client to server using UDP.

Positive 794 pApologizing in advance, I am no 802.11 expert and this is a long winded question... p  pI am working on an iOS voip client, we use the Cocoaasyncsocket library for our TCPUDP connections. The appiDevice is allowed to roam inout of wifi coverage for the purposes of this discussion we will assume the app is using wifi only... no cellular connection. We have the appropriate plist settings for backgroundmode voip, audio as well as requiring persistent wifi.p  pWe are having a problem that seems particular to Cisco APs. With the client app in the foreground and roaming out and in of wifi range, we noticed that eventually the iOS device will eventually not automatically rejoin the network. After a great deal of debug the failure to rejoin was noted to have nothing to do with the app. The failure to rejoin can ultimately be reproduced by forcing the AP via config to deauthenticate the iDevice three times. After the 1st and 2nd deauthentications, the iDevice readily automatically rejoins. But after the 3rd time, iOS does not automatically rejoin the network. p  pThe network will be rejoined if, for example, the iOS email app is put in the foreground.p  pWe were curious if any other VOIP type apps suffered this problem, and ran an experiment with running FaceTime and Skype on the iOS device. p  pSkype behaved much like our voip app, after the 3rd deauth the connection was lost. Trying to initiate another call resulted in a message to the effect of must have an internet connection to make a call.p  pFaceTime did disconnect on the 3rd deauth and failed to automatically rejoin... however, we were able to reinitiate another FaceTime call which caused iOS to rejoin the network and make the call.p  pWe would like to emulate the FaceTime behavior, but so far do not understand what we should be doing differently. To the best of our knowledge, we are properly closing the open sockets when we get disconnected. Is anyone familiar with this issue and have some insight to offerp

Ive tried looking it up on both the pfSense Guide as well as the forums, but since I cant find a related situation to mine, I hereby ask you guys for some help.p  pWhat it looks like now with example WAN IPsp  pWAN1 000.000.000.58 with internal IP addresses on LAN1 192.168.1.1  192.168.1.245 WAN2 000.000.000.61 with internal IP addresses on LAN2 192.168.2.1  192.168.2.245 WAN3 000.000.000.59 with internal IP addresses on LAN3 192.168.3.1  192.168.3.245p  pThe way I have it set up now is as followsp  pFirst I configured all the interfaces, whereas I now have 3 WAN interfaces with Static IPv4 addresses configured. Example WAN1 interace has a static IP of 000.000.000.59 and an IPv4 Upstream Gateway 000.000.000.57 which would be the broadcast address for all WANs.p  pThe problems start right here, because I cant add this address to anymore interfaces, because it already exists, but isnt selectable from the dropdown menu. This is one of the reasons why we want one WAN interface to handle all three of our WAN addresses with one uplink address.p  pSo the question in short is there a way to have one uplinkupstream address for all WANs. And if so, is there also a way to have just one WAN interface and three LAN interfaces in the following wayp  pWAN interface must have an uplinkupstream gateway of 000.000.000.57 for the following WAN addresses 000.000.000.58, 000.000.000.59 and 000.000.000.61 whereasp  pWAN1 000.000.000.58  for LAN1 interface w internal range of 192.168.1.1  192.168.1.245 WAN2 000.000.000.61  for LAN2 interface w internal range of 192.168.2.1  192.168.2.245 WAN3 000.000.000.59  for LAN3 interface w internal range of 192.168.3.1  192.168.3.245p  pWAN interface is not going to get a DHCP function, because it needs to be all three of the WAN addresses. The LAN interfaces are going to get the DHCP function for the ranges listed above.p  pIn other words p  ul liall traffic from the 192.168.1.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.58 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li liall traffic from the 192.168.2.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.61 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li liall traffic from the 192.168.3.x range must go through the WAN interface as 000.000.000.59 and then through the uplink of 000.000.000.57li ul  pCan this be done, yes or nop  pIf you need any more information, feel free to ask and Ill happily elaborate.p  pThank you very much in advancep  pGrtz,p  pJeffp

Negative 794 pIve looked through similar questions but Im still a little perplexed about something that seems to be a simple case in Rails.p  pLets say I have a model class called codeEmployeecode. One attribute of an employee is their codesecurityclearancecode, which is a string that can be codeNonecode, codeSomecode, or codeFullcode. No other values are valid. In other applications Id probably represent this an codeEmployeescode table that has a foreign key to the codeSecurityClearancescode table, which has exactly three rows.

Negative 794 pI am in the process of answering a request for tender on a contract that requires a decent amount of text processing. The main trouble is that the customer wants to be able to run this on any UNIX HPUX, Solaris, AIX, FreeBSD or Linux SLES, RHEL platform, which may constrain what I use to do it. They dont want to make the installation of extra tools a prerequisite.p  pIm torn between Perl and awk. I know that Perl is an ideal tool for processing text and Im reasonably adept at it but, before I put in the RFT response that Perl will be required, Id like to find out if anyone is running on a platform where Perl is not installed by default. p  pItd be handy to list those platforms in the RFT and give the client the option of which way they want to go. I have a vague recollection that its not on FreeBSD in the default install and it may also be that the nonLinux platforms also dont have it.p  pAny other tools can be suggested but, given my familiarity with Perl and awk, theyll probably be the only ones on the shortlist.p

Negative 794 pIve made it a company policy that all data access has to be done via Sprocs.  That includes Selects, Updates, Deletes and Inserts.  Were starting to become overrun by them.  Am I overkilling it  The selects are being executed, and the results dumped into a custom DAL.  p  pI have a feeling that this is a holy war kind of question.  Im leaning to side that the sprocs are overkill for simple selects, but a necessity for updates, inserts, and deletes.  One of the arguments for sprocs is security.  Certain users arent supposed to have access to certain parts of the app.  Who here actually creates more than one user on a db for a website  No handsp  pI also have a need for retrieving stats about a number of tables.

Hanselman.p  pI am building an AJAXpowered site whose input forms are created on the fly.p  pAll the code to accomplish this is done within a script tag or a javascript file. For example the following DOM elements are created when the page loads and are wrapped into an existing div defined in a viewp  pmyform.append myform.appendp  pWhen I click the submit button I need to get the values of the input form whose id is Name Name.val and then I return a Json object  Name name p  pFor this kind of scenario there is no way to use Html.Encode or AntiXss.HtmlEncode on the clientside. The only way to check if the input is not harmful is done on the serverside via a service layer.p  pThis seems a limitation. All is fine if and only if a view has a set of predefined inputs. When it is time to create them on the fly, the situation is different.p  pHave you thought of that situation guys p  pThanks for the attention you have put on this.p  pRoland Brussels, Belgiump

While what I wanted was for all the rows to stay the same is there any way to associate only 1 tbody with 1 thead inside the table so that it will not effect any others. Since this is probably quite confusing is there a better way to actually have multiple tables but the theads of each one stay the same no matter the data put in for the tbody. I know there will be questions but any help would be greatly appreciated and note I am completely open to doing this a different way. However what is required is that data can be hidden that is a table and will have a header for that information. There can be a displayable section that doesnt have to match it could be a div and the data inside each section should keep the same format. p  pPS If interested below is the JQuery I am using for this entire thing.p  precode    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt       document.readyfunction         report thead.childrentrodd.notheader.addClassodd         report thead.childrentrodd.notheader.eachfunctionindexthis.attrid, id  index          report thead.childrentreven.notheader.addClassbodyhead         report theadeven.notfirstchild.eachfunctionindexthis.attrid, bhid  index          report tbody.eachfunctionindexthis.attrid, bid  index         report tbody.eachfunctionindexthis.attrid, id  index         report tbody.childrentrnot.odd.hide         report tbody.hide         report theadeven.notfirstchild.hide          report tbody id0.show         For header of headers.         report thead.childrentrfirstchild.show         report thead.childrentr.notheader.not.bodyhead.clickfunction              report b  this.id.toggle             report bh  this.id.toggle             this.find.arrow.toggleClassup               ltscriptgt   codepre

Negative 794 pIve just written a recursive function and it dawned on me that all the variables I use within the function will remain allocated in memory until recursion breaks.

Negative 794 pI gathered from the much famed scaling rails screencasts that at some point when your  site gets big and bigger, proxy caching is the way to go. Proxy caching uses etag, among other things and since etags can be more specific and strong validator is perhaps the way to go. However, I also hear that in server farm scenarios the etag is not the right solution because it can vary across servers How p  pThis seems contradictory i.e. most likely one is implementing etag based proxy caching if they are running a large load balanced server farms. So if etag fails in this situation how do they do it lastmodified isnt really a great option. p  pIn a rails app lets say if my etags in a post index action is p  precodeetag gt allpostsPost.count. codepre  pwill this vary from server to server if its a load balanced server farm p

Negative 794 pId like to create a workflow that should be a quite common scenario, but Im not sure of the best way to do it. My company has a subsite for every project or team. Each subsite has its own task list. If i.e. the management team wants to delegate a task to another team, how should I set up that workflow If I create copies of the task, Id like changes to them to be synchronized both ways, which I guess might be quite a pain implementing Id need one workflow creating a copy in the assigned teams task list, and then one workflow on each list checking for changes and reflecting them to the other instance of the task. Would be a little bit of a pain implementing, wouldnt it But what are my options I thought of making one big companywide task list and just filter the tasks based on team name or project, so I would not have to copy the task but let the owner team and the assigned team view the same task, but it ocurred that showing tasks from the parent site on a sub site isnt obvious, and when connecting the list to Outlook all the tasks for all the projects are synchronized. Maybe I could create a view for the management team called delegated tasks or something, collecting tasks from all sub sites having the management team as ownerp  pI dont know if Ive misunderstood the main concepts of Sharepoint, cause even if my business cases seam very basic to me, theres never an obvious way to do it in Sharepoint...p  pThanks for any input on this, Sebastianp

Negative 794 pIm currently working on my Computer Engineering final year project.p  pI have to implement a VoIP and text messaging system  similar functionality to Whatsapp, with the addition of voice services consisting of clients and a server i.e. I have to develop the client software as well as the server software.p  pThe client software has to be implemented on Android and the server software has to be implemented on .NET using C and the clientserver connection will be done over WiFi. So ,basically, the setup will consist of a server app running on a PC and a wireless access point allowing the clients Android phones to connect to the server, no PSTN stuff or anything like that. Just the Android phones, a PC hosting the server and a wireless router.p  pFor now Im looking at the server development, specifically the messaging functionality. Some of the functions I will need for the messaging part server sidep  pRegister clients on the server.p  pKeep contact lists for clients.p  pkeep presence information for clients.p  pRoute messages between clients.p  pUpdate clients with presence information of other clients.p  pWhat protocols should I consider for the messaging part My research so far points to XMPP but there doesnt seem to be much out there for C specifically. Most of the stuff I saw was for Java or C, and it was mainly for client development.  The C libraries that I had a look at gloox, txmpp dont seem to be widely used. Would it be a good idea to implement my own mechanisms for the five functions listed above or should I use a standard protocol and standard libraries and if so, which ones I plan to use Visual Studio to develop the server.

Negative 794 pFirstly, I apologise for the sheer size of this question as Im sure what I am proposing is a big deal in terms of implementing and probably could be three or four separate questions in itself. I wouldnt ask if I werent in desperate need of help.p  pI have been given the monumental task of revising my companys risk management procedures in regards to our online work.p  pAs we take no backups, nor protect our data I have decided that, like anyone involved in professional programming should already be doing, we were going to protect our work through source control. I currently do this on a local basis with Git, but others use no source control and ultimately we lose a lot of the benefits that source control offers. Id rather us have a system where everyone uses Git and have it enforce the rule that if its not in source control, it doesnt stay. Obviously, were going to need a backup plan, but as a developer I suppose the first thing to do is to sort out the coding aspect of things before getting a backup solution sorted  obviously, any advice on that too is more than welcome.p  pWe run a ASP.NET website with a SQL Server 2005 backend, running Sitecore as our CMS of choice. In an ideal world I would like to have all the changing parts of this CMS site under source control, including the database.p  pAt the moment, and I know this isnt the greatest idea, I run one solution for ALL sublayouts built in Sitecore. This is under source control and thanks to Git Ive been able to add branches and push new features and fix bugs easily using Gitflow as my workflow solution. Im still quite new to Git though, so Ive not managed anything too complex outside of committing, ignoring certain files, etc.p  pOn top of this, I would also like to use source control to get the database contents under source control. As I understand it, you can serialise Sitecore content items as a huge tree within the file system saved as .item files if I remember correctly. If this is the ideal solution I would also like to add these to source control, although I dont know exactly where they would be saved on the file system. My file system right now is like thisp  precode Data      Logs, indexes, etc  is this needed to be in source control  Source    Helper files, although occasionally modified  Website   Containing all the files I edit, and other essential Sitecore stuff codepre  pAs mentioned already my current repository is only on my system, and it consists of a single solution folder with a bunch of .ascx, .ascx.cs, .ascx.cs.designer and the odd .aspx file or two. This tends to make my life easier when uploading as, like with the p  pWhat I would like input on is an ideal way of managing this for all developers. Despite using a DVCS I would prefer to have the live server viewed as the main repository and for all the other developers to push and pull from it, and each other. Well be using the a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodelgitflow workflow solutiona as it conforms to our way of development nicely. What Im worried about, obviously, is setting this up correctly without destroying whats currently a very expensive, hightraffic site on a server with no backup. p  pTips and advice on how much of the data on the server to stick in the repository, guidance on how to handle the serialised data in Sitecore and potentially how to use the source control itself as a way of backing up to a separate repository would be welcomed. This is the first time Ive had to build a source control systemworkflow for a live website, so any guidance and advice on what would be the best thing for me to do would be much appreciated.p  hr  pEDIT I am going to put a bounty on this to try and get more guides on how people handle Sitecore with Git.p  pTo clarify myself, I am NOT looking for a way to back up my work, rather a way so that a number of developers can work on it and ensure that the code on the website is up to date with a central repository. For example,  I have referenced before that I will be using gitflow to manage my workflow. The origin repo will exist on a shared server which in time will likely be a test environment, and all developers will have clones of that to work on and to push to. From here, I want to be able to push changes from the origin repo on the shared drive to the live server and back again if errors are found. I would also like to include serialised content items in my repo.p

Negative 794 pI have a python list that contains about 700 terms that I would like to use as metadata for some database entries in Django. I would like to match the terms in the list against the entry descriptions to see if any of the terms match but there are a couple of issues. My first issue is that there are some multiword terms within the list that contain words from other list entries. An example isp  precodeIntrusion Intrusion Detection codepre  pI have not gotten very far with re.findall as it will match both Intrusion and Intrusion Detection in the above example. I would only want to match Intrusion Detection and not Intrusion.p  pIs there a better way to do this type of matching I thought maybe maybe about trying NLTK but it didnt look like it could help with this type of matching.p  pEditp  pSo to add a little more clarity, I have a list of 700 terms such as firewall or intrusion detection. I would like to try to match these words in the list against descriptions that I have stored in a database to see if any match, and I will use those terms in metadata. So if I have the following stringp  precodeThere are many types of intrusion detection devices in production today.  codepre  pand if I have a list with the following termsp  precodeIntrusion Intrusion Detection codepre  pI would like to match intrusion detection, but not intrusion.

The idea behind all of this is to take all of the matches and put them in a list, and then process them.p

Negative 794 pMy IDE is Zend Studio 8, which features a relatively basic perspective for JavaScript similar to, if not the same as, the perspective in Eclipse PDT.  In the application Im working on, we extend a base object across multiple files, which has effectively killed the autocomplete functionality.  See below for an example scenario...p  precode global.js var App       objectA          method1 function ,         method2 function      ,     objectB          method1 function ,         method2 function          extend.js App.Extend       anotherMethod function   codepre  pIn this scenario, typing codeApp.code causes autocomplete to appear with codeobjectAcode and codeobjectBcode, but not codeExtendcode.  If I add Extend to the App variable in global.js, it will appear in the autocomplete, but not with anotherMethod.  If I were to use codevar Extend    code  code, autocomplete would work for the codeExtendcode object, so the problem does not seem to be related to the fact that the code is extended across multiple files.  Perhaps it is because a single object is being spread across multiple files...or something else.p  pAnyone have any ideasp

Negative 794 pSo I was playing around with some thought experiments where I imagined what would happen when two functions became mutually recursive.

Compile it with any O switch and it falls into an infinite loop.p  pThoughts Is this potentially a compiler bug, or is this to be expected Id think in the case of O optimizations, it would realize that foox and barx return just x.p  pI didnt expect it to actually optimize away the call and completely ignore printing out The value is to standard input.p  pEdit I compiled this as just g source.cpp O123, under Cygwin using GCC 4.5.0.

The input text is a sequence of n words of lengths l1,l2,...,ln, measured in characters. We want to print this paragraph neatly on a number of lines that hold a maximum of M characters each. Our criterion of neatness is as follows. If a given line contains words i through j and we leave exactly one space between words, the number of extra space characters at the end of the line is the difference between M and the total number of characters in the words plus the spaces between them  .We wish to minimize the sum, over all lines except the last, of the cubes of the numbers of extra space characters at the ends of lines. Give a dynamicprogramming algorithm to print a paragraph of n words neatly on a printer. Analyze the running time and space requirements of your algorithm.p

Neither FileStream nor StreamWriter allows you to set both of those paramters as far as I can tell, based on what Ive seen on MSDN. p  precodeFileStream fs  new FileStreamPermaServerList, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write StreamWriter hiddensw  new StreamWriterEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments, false codepre  pSo, if you look at that, how would I get it to save a file called PermaServerList to the location My Documents, regardless of the version of Windows theyre using I dont want to hard code in a location, I want it to always be whatever My Documents is in their particular version.p  pAlternatively, the idea behind this is that every time the program starts, I want it to load the list they last saved automatically. Is there a simple way to do this Right now, the idea is that Ill just save to their chosen location, and then make a second copy in my predefined location and just load that on program startup.

If anybody could help me shortly how to draw, I will be really appreciated. Or any other suggestion rather than heatmaps are welcome as well.  I know there is plenty of samples about this, but still I cannot manage to draw with my own data.p

Negative 794 pI was Googling around, but couldnt find anything that can help me. We are using SQLServer 2008 R2, and its our policy to use stored procedures for all our database calls.  This works fine, but the problem is now that our list of procedures has grown to over 600, were making duplicates of syntactically matching queries that someone else and sometimes ourselves wrote.  p  pRight now we search for all the procs that contain the same tables and columns as the one we want to create and then see if we can just reuse it, but this is becoming a more and more time consuming activity.  If we try anything more complicated than just searching tableview and column names, then we might miss an existing proc simply due to the syntax it happened to use.p  pAre there any tools which can take a query and tell you which procs are, or at the very least suggest could be, syntactically equal to your query  Or, barring that, what methods do you use to ensure you dont have multiple procs containing the same query written slightly differentlyp

Negative 794 pWell, I am a nonFacebook developer, and a normal .NET programmer who have created a Facebook application for a regular website around one year ago using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFacebookfeaturesFBML relnofollowFBMLa. I have no time to read the roadmap every day and know what will be next. So I had no idea about a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOAuth relnofollowOAutha and HTTPS till yesterday.p  pAll of a sudden I received an email yesterday saying 27 Sep upgrade to OAuth 2.0 and HTTPS, otherwise the application will be disabled from 1st Oct.p  pNow, I read about OAuth 2.0 the whole day yesterday, and think I can get around it now chaining things, but I found that the site which currently host my Facebook application doesnt have SSL HTTPS support or dedicated IP address and I found that I need to invest around 20 to get SSL and another 20 for a dedicated IP address. I am ready to pay  for it, but as you know a response from hosting are not that quick.p  pNow I have emailed my hosting to make arrangement for it, but sadly they have not responded yet, and I now only have one day left I dont know they will respond or not. p  pSo how can I save my application I dont have any server that support HTTPS for now. Even if I get some free SSL I am not able to implement it as I dont have a dedicated IP address.p  pIs there some way I can put a will be back soon kind of message. Or how can I save the application now p  pI think I need to update that HTTPS canvas page in the setting anyhow.p

Negative 794 pIt seems like jQTransform doesnt set the height of UL tag for SELECT properly when its in a fancybox. The height is always 0, which means when you click to open it, the options are not visible. I have tried forcing it to set the height on open, but with that solution, it takes 67 clicks to make it stick i.e. no good. Has anyone figured out how to make them work well together It doesnt even work with default CSS. Other form elements seem to be working fine. Just not SELECT.p  pI have only a couple days to hit the deadline so any help is appreciated.

Negative 794 pI have been using Emacs since version 18. Emacs Lisp isnt my routine programming language, but years ago I invested some time studying it to the point of creating a .emacs thats better for me than any GUI IDE to date.p  pThat was a onetime effort and since then, I forgot completely how to program in lisp.p  pAlas, every time I upgrade my Emacs 18  19  20  21  22  23, something in my .emacs breaks, and I end up spending way too many hours sometimes days fixing these.p  pIn many other languages I program routinely, it is possible to write code that never becomes obsolete. In emacs, on the other hand, I can never predict how things will change. For example code[MTAB]code that used to work up until version 21.4.1, no longer works in version 23 and must be replaced with codeMtcode. Another example is codediredomittogglecode that used to work in version 21 but stopped working in version 22, being replaced by codediredomitmodecode.p  pNow, I know that if a .emacs doesnt do much, its possible to write an almost empty .emacs that can probably stay compatible with future versions.p  pBut my .emacs is huge, designed to run on many different operating systems and their different flavors, editions and versions, including nonGUI systems without a single change. I wish there was a coreAPI or subset that is guaranteed to always work.p  pIs there really such a way to write a .emacs that will always stay upward compatiblep  pIf so, where can I find a cook book or authoritative guidelines for accomplishing thisp

Negative 794 pI have a ARMv5powered nonXScale device the a hrefhttpwww.sharp.co.jpedictionary relnofollowSHARP Braina electronic dictionary with Windows Embedded CE 6.0 installed in NAND flash, and I use TCPMP to play my favorite AAC tunes and MPEG4 movies.p  pBut, when I start TCPMP, sometimes TCPMP freezes. So I looked into TCPMP and I managed to found that the freeze happens when this code is executed.p  precodeCheckARMXScale PROC mov r0,0x1000000 mov r1,0x1000000 mar acc0,r0,r1  lt here mov r0,32 mov r1,32 mra r0,r1,acc0 cmp r0,0x1000000 moveq r0,1 movne r0,0 cmp r1,0x1000000 64bit or just 40bit moveq r0,2 mov pc,lr codepre  pThis code determines whether XScale is present by trying executing XScale instruction, and catching the exception if the Undefined Instruction exception was thrown. p  pThe problem is that somehow the system fails to pass this exception to TCPMP properly, causing TCPMP to freeze. It seems to be not because of Windows CE, but rather because of buggy drivers in this device. Any driver updates are not expected since running TCPMP on this device is not officially supported.p  pI posted this issue to a hrefhttpwww.2ch.net relnofollow title2channel2channela, and some people claimed that this way to determine if XScale is present is not good, but no one even tried to find a better way. So I googled and read through ARMv5 Architecture Reference Manual and so on, but I could find nothing. It appears that almost every program that utilizes XScale instruction set determines if XScale is present in the same way.p  pThe question is that, is it possible to determine if XScale instruction set is present, without making use of any exception or any CPU mode except user mode p

I initially just tried doing it as p  precodeOverride     public void onLocationChangedLocation loc Spits out single location for current disconnect         System.out.printlnlocation equals loc         latitudeDouble.toStringloc.getLatitude         longitudeDouble.toStringloc.getLongitude         writeToDbMyLocListener.this,latitude,longitude                man.removeUpdateslistenerStops location manager from listening for updates         listenernull         mannull       public void writeToDbContext context,String latitude,String longitude     dbnew DbAdaptercontext     db.openToWrite     db.deleteAll     db.insertlatitude     db.insertlongitude     db.close  codepre  pBut that was no use, and would give me a nullPointerException on the db.openToWrite line everytime. getApplicationContext does not work here either.p  pIve now modified it to write to the DB in a thread asp  precodeOverride public void onLocationChangedLocation loc Spits out single location for current disconnect     System.out.printlnlocation equals loc     latitudeDouble.toStringloc.getLatitude     longitudeDouble.toStringloc.getLongitude     Runnable runnernew SaveLocationlatitude,longitude     new Threadrunner.start     man.removeUpdateslistenerStops location manager from listening for updates     listenernull     mannull   public class SaveLocation implements Runnable         String latitude         String longitude       DbAdapter db         public SaveLocationString latitude,String longitude             this.latitudelatitude             this.longitudelongitude                   Override         public void run              db.openToWrite             db.deleteAll             db.insertlatitude             db.insertlongitude             db.close                    codepre  pAnd I initialized the Database in the onCreate method asp  precodepublic class MyLocListener extends Service implements LocationListener      static LocationManager man     static LocationListener listener     static Location location     public DbAdapter db      Override     public void onCreate          super.onCreate            this.dbnew DbAdapterMyLocListener.this      codepre  pBut now, this second attempt keeps giving me a much more condensed error, but it still faults on the line where i attempt to open the database to be writeable.

Negative 794 pIm trying to build a section tag from the ground up using documentFragment. It will include an h1 tag an article tag, which were initially being added with appendChild.  This section tag will also be cloned at some point and adjusted using cloneNode.p  pThen I found out that a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb927917enus relnofollowappendChild is buggy in IEa along with articles from a hrefhttpwww.nczonline.netblog20080317thedreadedoperationabortederror relnofollowNick Zakasa, a hrefhttppaulirish.com2011surefiredomelementinsertion relnofollowPaul Irisha and a hrefhttpwww.stevesouders.comblog20100511appendchildvsinsertbefore relnofollowSteve Soudersa quantifying how much appendChild sucks. I searched through S.O. for an alternative and using insertBefore and firstChild  seems to be the general consensus. As I want to insert nodes inside of other nodes, Im not sure if insertBefore is an option here.p  pTo be fair, this may not be the most efficient code. Its probably faster to code in the section tag with all the child nodes on the page then it is to script everything, then load it onto the page. And when I clone it, it will be easy to just find child nodes with firstChild and then adjust them. But before I do that, I just want to make sure that theres no other way to insert nodes inside of an element other than appendChildp  pThanks in advance...kaidezp

Negative 794 pWe have an application that stores some configuration values from CC in MongoDB and has the   capability to be restarted i.e. it runs for a while, someone interrupts the application, changes the configuration, then runs the app again, and it picks up where it left off. This works like a charm for boolean and string configurations.p  pBut then we have some integers in our current  CC implementation  32 bit values. And when I use the MongoDB console to modify those integer values, Mongo always stores them back as Number which is doulble in the CC implementation. We will change the app to take double values where it expects integers but I was wondering if there is a way to force Mongo to store integers from its JavaScript console.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 794 pIve been looking at high availability solutions such as heartbeat, and keepalived to failover when an haproxy load balancer goes down. I realised that although we would like high availability its not really a requirement at this point in time to do it to the extent of the expenditure on having 2 load balancer instances running at any one time so that we get instant failover particularly as one lb is going to be redundant in our setup.p  pMy alternate solution is to fire up a new load balancer EC2 instance from an AMI if the current load balancer has stopped working and associate it to the elastic ip that our domain name points to. This should ensure that downtime is limited to the time it takes to fire up the new instance and associate the elastic ip, which given our current circumstance seems like a reasonably cost effective solution to high availability, particularly as we can easily do it multiav zone. I am looking to do this using the following steps p  ol liPrepare an AMI of the load balancerli liFire up a single ec2 instance acting as the load balancer and assign the Elastic IP to itli liHave a micro server ping the current load balancer at regular intervals we always have an extra micro server running anywayli liIf the ping times out, fire up a new EC2 instance using the load balancer AMIli liAssociate the elastic ip to the new instanceli liShut down the old load balancer instanceli liRepeat step 3 onwards with the new instanceli ol  pI know how to run the commands in my script to start up and shut down EC2 instances, associate the elastic IP address to an instance, and ping the server.p  pMy question is what would be a suitable ping here Would a standard ping suffice at regular intervals, and what would be a good interval Or is this a rather simplistic approach and there is a smarter health check that I should be doingp  pemAlso if anyone foresees any problems with this approach please feel free to commentemp

Negative 794 pIve been creating unit tests using JUnit in Eclipse and the basic principles of JUnit are clear to me. The tests run as they should and now its time to find a good way to report on the failed tests. Most examples I come accross on the web are using some sort of built system like Ant, Maven or Hudson to run the tests at the same time as when theyre building the project, but dont need this integration in the build process. The tests should be able to run independent from a build system. In the end these systems just take the info they get from JUnit and put it in a nice HTML layout.p  pI learned that its possible to read out the JUnit information by a hrefhttpwww.junit.orgapidocsorgjunitrunnernotificationRunListener.html relnofollowcreating a custom listener via the RunListener class of JUnitCorea and handle the failures as they happen using the testFailure method. When creating my tests, I always provided a custom message for the assertion errors. My problem is that this message does not show up in the failure trace of JUnit. Instead, the failure trace would show java.lang.Exception could not  invoke . When I look at the console, I see the same stack trace but below also folows a line that is preceded by Caused by  and here I do see my custom error message.p  precodeCaused by java.lang.AssertionError ltmy custom error messagegt     at  codepre  pAs Im just getting started with JUnit and I do not know if this is normal behaviour of JUnit or is there something wrong in the way I implemented my tests and should I just see my custom messages in the failure trace I also noticed that when I catch the assertion error in the method where I perform the test, I CAN access the message using error.getMessage. So if necessary, this would be a solution and would also allow me to include additional information in the report that is accessible at the moment I catch the error i.e. url of webpage, etc. but putting a trycatch block around every assertion would defeat its purpose in my opinion.p  pAs I said Im new to unit testing but also java development in general, so its very likely that Im making some stupid mistakes.

Negative 794 pThis one has me quite puzzled.  Basically I am developing a multi window application using transparent shaped windows using a custom Synth LampF.  Parts of the application invoke codeJFramecodecodeJDialogcode components from the parent frame.  Within these components I have pop up menus and comboboxes, the problem is that some people using the applications experience the pop up menus not appearing when invoked.  There are no exceptions and the code executes fine including for popup menus show method.p  pI have tried to nail this down to OS specifics without much joy, apart from there doesnt seem to be an issue on mac OSX.  Some windows users such as myself experience no problems, others do....p  pAlso I have tracked down the offending line of code which sets the window opacityp  precodeAWTUtilities.setWindowOpaquewindow, false  codepre  pIf I remove this LOC then the popup windows appear fine.  In addition replacing this LOC with p  precodewindow.setBackgroundnew Color0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f codepre  pproduces the same issue.  Another thing is that if I use the default LampF the popups render ok.p  pJust to confirm the issue is the same for both codeJFramecode and codeJDialogcode components, and was just wondering if anybody else has either come across this issue or could point me in the direction of the possible cause.p  pCheersp  pTest source to reproducep  precodeimport com.sun.awt.AWTUtilities  import javax.swing. import javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthLookAndFeel import java.awt. import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener  public class TestFrame extends JFrame      public TestFrame         super.setTitleTest Frame          JButton btnDialog  new JButtonOpen Dialog         btnDialog.addActionListenernew ActionListener              Override             public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                  TestDialog dialog  new TestDialogTestFrame.this, true                 dialog.setVisibletrue                                super.addbtnDialog, BorderLayout.CENTER         super.pack         super.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         super.setVisibletrue           public static void mainString[] args         initLookAndFeel         new TestFrame           public static void initLookAndFeel          SynthLookAndFeel lookAndFeel  new SynthLookAndFeel         try              lookAndFeel.loadTestFrame.class.getResourceAsStreamtestskin.xml, TestFrame.class             UIManager.setLookAndFeellookAndFeel                  catch Exception e             e.printStackTrace                    public static class TestDialog extends JDialog          public TestDialogFrame owner, boolean modal              superowner, modal              JComboBox petList  new JComboBoxnew String[]  Bird, Cat, Dog, Rabbit, Pig              super.addpetList, BorderLayout.CENTER              super.setUndecoratedtrue             AWTUtilities.setWindowOpaquethis, false             super.pack                codepre  pand the testskin.xmlp  precodeltsynthgt      ltstyle idbackingStylegt         ltopaque valuetruegt         ltfont nameDialog size14gt     ltstylegt     ltbind stylebackingStyle typeregion key.gt      ltstyle idComboBox List Renderergt         ltopaque valuetruegt         ltstate valueENABLEDgt             ltcolor typeTEXTFOREGROUND value000000gt         ltstategt         ltstate valueDISABLEDgt             ltcolor typeTEXTFOREGROUND value999999gt         ltstategt         ltstate valueSELECTEDgt             ltcolor typeTEXTFOREGROUND valueCC6600gt             ltcolor typeTEXTBACKGROUND valueFFEEDDgt         ltstategt     ltstylegt     ltbind styleComboBox List Renderer typename keyComboBox.listRenderer gt      ltstyle idCombo Boxgt         ltproperty keyComboBox.showPopupOnNavigation typeboolean valuetruegt         ltstategt             ltcolor valueD8D987 typeBACKGROUNDgt         ltstategt     ltstylegt     ltbind styleCombo Box typeregion keyComboBox gt  ltsynthgt codepre  pAs mentioned removingp  precodeAWTUtilities.setWindowOpaquewindow, false  codepre  pmakes the combobox pop up menu render ok, in addition adding a default background to all styles under stylebackingStyle e.g.p  precodeltstategt    ltcolor valueD8D987 typeBACKGROUNDgt ltstategt codepre  pwill at least make the pop menu appear, however it is still not renderd properly.

I myself on windows 7 ultimate 64 bit experience no problems, another user using windows 7 premium 64 bit does experience the same issues.p  hr  pSome progress, The paint method for the pop up menu components fails to invoke ifp  precodeAWTUtilities.setWindowOpaquewindow, false  codepre  pis set.  Manually calling repaint, updateUI, revalidate after calling the show method will make the pop up menu render ok.  For combox elements setting a custom UI and overiding the createPopup method, with a class extending javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicComboPopup that invokes repaintupdateUIrevalidate on show e.g. p  precode public class ComboPopup extends BasicComboPopup       public ComboPopup JComboBox combo           supercombo           Override     public void showComponent invoker, int x, int y          super.showinvoker, x, y         this.updateUI       codepre  pwill make the combox menu render ok.  However I am yet to find a workaround for submneu JMenu items for a popup since the popup is created within a private method.  This seems like a bug, but if I am doing something wrong could someone let me know p  pCheersp  pJonathanp

Negative 794 pI apologize if Im not super clear with my explanation but Ill add to and edit this question for clarity if requested.p  pI am developing an Android app which receives data through an external API and stores data locally using ORMLite. Prior to storing data locally and using ORMLite I had models which retrieved JSON from the server and parsed it viap  precodeGson gson  new Gson  String result  ApiClient.httpPostuserroute  User user  gson.fromJsonresult, User.class codepre  pThe User class was defined p  precodepublic class User    int id   String name   ArrayListltImagegt media  codepre  pAnd the Image classp  precodepublic class Image    int id   int creatorid   String url  codepre  pThis is a simplified representation of the models and methods but I believe Ive kept all the relevant information. BTW, codemediacode is a JSON object which contains the codeImagescode. p  pNow Im trying to also store the data locally. In order to have the relationship between Users and Images using ORMLite it seems you have to employ ForeignCollection class and ForeignCollectionField annotation. I dont believe Gson can directly parse the Json for the codemediacode field in the User class as a ForeignCollection object, so I thought I needed to create two fields codemediaCollectioncode and codemediacode. p  pUsing ORMLite the User class now looks like thisp  precodeDatabaseTabletableName  Users public class User    DatabaseFieldgeneratedId  true   int id    DatabaseField   String name    ForeignCollectionField   ForeignCollectionltImagegt mediaCollection    ArrayListltImagegt media  codepre  pThe Image class with ORMLite looks like thisp  precodeDatabaseTabletableName  Images public class Image     DatabaseFieldgeneratedId  true   int id    DatabaseFieldforeigntrue, foreignAutoCreatetrue, foreignAutoRefreshtrue   private User user    DatabaseField   int creatorid    DatabaseField   String url   codepre  pHow the flow of the app works is first I hit the local database for a User. I perform some logic which then determines if I need to actually hit the server to update or refresh the User data.p  pWhether the data comes locally or from the remote server, I need to display the codeImagecode in the same view. As it stands now, the URL for the codeImagecode is stored in different types of objects depending on whether the data is local or remote. What I would like to do is if the codeImagecode is stored in a codeForeginCollectioncode object, convert that object into an codeArrayListcode and then proceed with the rest of my code which extracts the codeImagecode URL and displays it.p  pI guess there are two questions.p  ol lipIs this a good plan or should I write two completely separate ways of extracting the codeImagecode URL from the data, NOT converting the object from codeForeignCollectioncode to codeArrayListcodepli lipIf it emisem a good plan, how do I convert a codeForeginCollectioncode to an codeArrayListcodepli ol

Negative 794 pWhat I have going on is a ListView.  That ListView uses an adapter to inflate a RelativeLayout that only contains one ViewPager.p  pin the getView for the adapter the custom PagerAdapter is instantiated for the ViewPager and .setAdapter is called for the ViewPager.  RIGHT after setAdapter is called I do a return row or return view  That ends the getView method for that adapter in the ListView.p  pIn the PagerAdapter I have implementedp  precodepublic Object instantiateItemView collection, int position  codepre  pThis is basically what sets up the child views pages for the Pager Adapter.  It does the inflating and setting all the children views and then adds the view to the collection.p  pI think the problem lies in the fact that after the return is done in the row, the PagerAdapter still hasnt finished setting up the children, so the ListView thinks the ViewPager is empty and draws it out to the screen that way.  What I have done is what I think is a hack basically.p  pI try to measure the first child view in instantiateItem using something like thisp  precodeview.measureMeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpecwidthMeasureSpecSize, MeasureSpec.ATMOST, MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpecheightMeasureSpecSize, MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED Pager collection.requestedHeight  view.getMeasuredHeight codepre  pThe values heightMeasureSpecSize actually is a public property that is set by the listView adapter before .setAdapter is called The Pager collection.requestedHeight is another property I made on the ViewPager itself when I extended it. It defaults to 100 before a value is set to it.  I then overrided the onMeasure method like sop  precodeOverride protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec     super.onMeasurewidthMeasureSpec, View.MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpecrequestedHeight, View.MeasureSpec.ATMOST  codepre  pWith all this code, when I run the application, whenever onMeasure gets called on the ViewPager, the ListView seems to add the ViewPager to the list with 100 and then recalculate using onMeasure and redraw the item using the measuredHeight of the first child of the View Pager....p  pAll of this because wrapcontent is broken in ViewPager.  Is there a better way than doing this possibly  It seems terribly inefficient.p

Negative 794 pI am currently attempting to make a codebuttoncode which is in the shape of a trapezoid. I found a method of creating the shape which involved CSS making borders and such. The CSS method worked in the way that it made the shape, but I ran into an issue where the whole element is contained in a rectangle, so when you click in the white spaces outside of the trapezoid it will still register as a click in the element.p  pIn short, I am trying to make the HTML element to be the shape, of a trapezoid, not just the visible shape itself. Thus when a user clicks any area around the button that is outside the visible Trapezoid, but may be within the actual boundaries of a button rectangle, it should ignore the click.

Negative 794 pI have a function created that displays a speechbubble when I hover over the parent object. However the bubble is set to display above the parent object, as calculated by its height.p  pIm trying to work this into a responsive design, and as such the width and height are both dynamic. Ive tried to run the function after the window resize with the following codep  precodewindow.resizefunction      .popup.popup .triggerresize codepre  pThis almost seems to do the trick, but its quite buggy. You can see what I mean by checking out a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnorsewulfjMG4K relnofollowthis jsfiddle I put togethera.p  pThe speech bubble works fine before the window is resized, but once its been resized and you hover over one of the trigger objects the speech bubble animates for what looks like 5 or so repetitions.p  pNo doubt this wasnt originally written for a responsive design and Im not much of a JS developer, so if anyone sees any clear improvements that could be made Id be happy to accept them Dp

Negative 794 pIm writing a noninvasive conservative GC in C and Im having some concerns about the correctness of its stack scanning phase.p  pSpecifically, with no compiler optimizations enabled, it works fine because every local variable which points to an object is predictably allocated on the stack. In codeO3code, the GC misses some valid references, which I believe is due to the fact that the compiler opts to use registers instead of the stack, which the GC scans for some variables and function argument passing and the GC isnt yet programmed to handle that. If you suspect that this still shouldnt be happening and that Im misreading the source of the problem, please let me know.p  pApart from some rudimentary requirements having to use a codeGCmalloccode instead of codemalloccode for GC objects, not pointing to the GC heap from the nonGC heap and, of course, not explicitly calling codefreecode, the GC shouldnt have any more requirements from the client code or the compiler. Therefore, requiring any additional special patterns from the client code is not an option. Similarly, forcing programs that use this GC to be compiled with special compiler flags that suppress stack optimizations should be a last resort option, at best. With these two out of the way, heres the buildup to my question.p  pIm trying to find a way to make the GC handle the codeO3code case with the stack optimizations seamlessly. Heres my train of thoughts assumptions, more preciselyp  ol liNo matter how far GCC or any valid compiler goes with the optimizations, it wouldnt go so far that it would compromise the correctness of the program. li liIf [1] holds, I believe that at least in practical implementations of C if stronga reachablestrong allocated as local at any call level strongvariablestrong is going to remain accessible at all, it stronghas to be either on the stack or in the current register setstrong, but not really anywhere else. li liIf [2] holds, it emshouldem mean that simply dumping all the registers to the stack when the GC cycle starts would guarantee that a subsequent stack scanning would now find the previously missed references as well.li liAdditionally, if [1] and [2] hold, then if the compiler lets any variables be overwritten in the case of registerbased ones, mostly, it means that it has performed some level of code analysis and it has proved that that variable isnt used anywhere else in that function. So, in that sense, if we dont see a variable in the stack or in the register dump, even though its still in scope theoretically, this shouldnt be a cause for alarm for me because the compiler has simply sort of helped out the GC by getting rid of a dead reference.li ol  pstrongQuestion 1strong Are emallem 4 of my assumptions correctp  pstrongQuestion 2strong What is the most portable way to force a register dump Ive found some sources claiming that a simple codesetjmpcode call will have this effect.

Negative 794 pSo ive made my own FPS, graphics and guns and all of that cool stuff When we fire, the bullet should take a random direction inside the crosshair, as defined byp  precode    float randomXfloatMath.random0.08fguns[currentWeapon].currAcc0.04fguns[currentWeapon].currAcc     float randomYfloatMath.random0.08fguns[currentWeapon].currAcc0.04fguns[currentWeapon].currAcc      bulletList.addnew Bulletnew float[]playerXpos, playerYpos, playerZpos, new float[]playerXrotrandomX, playerYrotrandomY, float 0.5 codepre  pWe calculate the randomness in X and Y say you had a crosshair size guns[currentWeapon].currAcc of 10, then the bullet could go 0.4 to any side and it would remain inside the crosshair.  After that is calculated, we send the player position as the starting position of the bullet, along with the direction its meant to take its the players direction with that extra randomness, and finally its speed not important atm, tho.p  pNow, each frame, the bullets have to move, so for each bullet we callp  precodeposition[0]  floatMath.sindirection[1]piover180  floatMath.cosdirection[0]piover180  speed position[2]  floatMath.cosdirection[1]piover180  floatMath.cosdirection[0]piover180  speed  position[1]  floatMath.sindirection[0]piover180  speed codepre  pSo, for X and Z positions, the bullet moves according to the players rotation on the Y and X axis say you were looking horizontally into Z, 0 degrees on X and 0 on Y X would move 01speed and Z would move 11speed.p  pFor Y position, the bullet moves according to the rotation on X axis varies between 90 and 90, meaning it stays at the same height if the players looking horizontally or moves completely up if the player is looking vertically.p  pNow, the problem stands as follows If i shoot horizontally, everything works beautifully. Bullets spread around the cross hair, as seen in a hrefhttpsdl.dropbox.comu16387578horiz.jpg relnofollowhttpsdl.dropbox.comu16387578horiz.jpgap  pThe thing is, if i start looking up, the bullets start concentrating around the center, and make this vertical line the further into the sky i look.  a hrefhttpsdl.dropbox.comu16387578verti.jpg relnofollowhttpsdl.dropbox.comu16387578verti.jpga The 1st image is around 40 in the X axis, the 2nd is a little higher and the last is when i look vertically.p  pWhat am i doing wrong here I designed this solution myself can im pretty sure im messing up somewhere, but i cant figure it out p

Negative 794 pBasically what I am overall trying to do isp  pOne of your professors hears of your emerging programming expertise and asks you to write a SINGLE program that can be used to help them with their grading.

Your program will prompt the user for the students name, entered as Firstname Lastname i.e. Bob Smith, the students 3exam scores and 1final exam score all whole numbers. Class size varies from semester to semester, but 100 is the limit declare as a constant.p  pRead in information for ALL students before doing any calculations or displaying any output.

Negative 794 pOk so Ill start this off by saying Im quite new to programming, never mind this forum, and so if theres any moreless information I should give just let me know.  I hope Im not asking a stupid question Pp  pAnyways, Im attempting to write my first allmyownwork program well except for a simple 2d array program that serves as a multiplication program.  In it Im essentially trying to make a simple model of game theory.  You have 2 people that can make a choice, which is predetermined and I denote as int trait which is 0 or 1. However I scale this up to having 100 people initially, and select 2 people at a time to randomly test, and depending on their traits, theyre allotted different scores to determine how many offspring theyll have to conduct further tests, but that doesnt entirely matter because my issue is before then.p  pI set up my test subjects by making a structp  precodestruct Person  used for testing and reproduction initialization     int trait  0 for normal  1 for phycopath     int score  reproductive score       struct Person id codepre  pand then allocate memory like so codeid  struct Person  mallocn  sizeofstruct Personcodep  pand initialize the struct doingp  precodefori  0 i lt nn i      id[i  sizeofstruct Person].trait  0     id[i  sizeofstruct Person].score  0   fori  nn i lt n i      id[i  sizeofstruct Person].trait  1     id[i  sizeofstruct Person].score  0  codepre  pand before you say Im doing everything wrong and Im not saying that Im not, just some food for thought, I check that it initializes properly immediately afterwards usingp  precodefori  0 i lt n i          printfid[d].trait  dt, i, id[i  sizeofstruct Person].trait         printfid[d].score  dn, i, id[i  sizeofstruct Person].score       codepre  pNow my problem is that somewhere in my code and Ive done a few tests to point out to me about where the issue is, the traits in the test subjects are consistently altered for when i is between and including 26 and 37 yes every time.  This suggests to me that somewhere in the code my variable id[] is being toyed with, yet i dont recall it at all between its initialization and testing. And my tests have shown that the issue lies withinp  precodefori  0 i lt nn i          ifp gt 0          srand timeNULL          randn  rand  p MAKE SURE THIS IS OK         storea  randn         storeaa  randf[randn]         testa  storeaa  sizeofstruct Person codepre  ptesta and also testb later on in the program are used for recalling the test subjects in the exact same fashion that the above testingprint statement is done.p  pThe program compiles and runs just not the way I want it to, and about every ten times I try running it I get an errorp  blockquote   pAssertion oldtop  mbinptr char  ampavbins[1  1    2]  builtinoffsetof struct mallocchunk, fd ampamp oldsize    0  unsigned long oldsize  unsigned   longbuiltinoffsetof struct mallocchunk, fdnextsize2    sizeofsizet  1 amp 2  sizeofsizet  1 ampamp   oldtopsize amp 0x1 ampamp unsigned longoldend amp pagemask  0   failed.p blockquote  pwhich suggests to me that the random number generator could be the fault Or a memory leaksome where Im really clueless at this point to be honest.p  pIm sorry for the drawn out, and hopefully not too confusing explanation.  Ive been working at this problem for a good 2 days and spent many hours researching online to avoid pestering people with my question.  Any ideas of whats going wrong would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 794 pI was just wondering if it was alright to resize or move a presented view controller, like one with UIModalPresentationFormSheet style or if this is against Apple Human Interface Guidelines.p  pAs stated in the HIG document, Form sheet. Has fixed dimensions of 540 x 620 points and is centered in the screen, When the keyboard is visible in landscape, a form sheet view moves up to just below the status bar and This style is good for gathering structured information from the user.p  pSo, would it be a violation of the HIG if I use another dimension, I choose another behavior for when the keyboard shows or if I use an all different paradigm to gather structured information Like, for example, not even using two different view controllers to gather and display informationp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 794 pstrongIs using a generic codeDataEventArgsltTDatagtcode class, rather than declaring and using a custom EventArgs inherited class, in an event declaration, a violation of the .Net Event pattern convention Or considered bad practice in some circumstancesstrongp  pThe emnamingem convention of naming the event args is to use the event name and append the postfix EventArgs. Using codeDataEventArgsltTDatagtcode omits the event name, although it shows you the type of the data transmitted.p  pYou could perhaps argue that the generic DataEventArgs class is kind of closed for extensions, such as adding another property, unless you can modify the class that you use for TData.p  hr  pLonger explanationp  pWhen declaring a standard delegate event that includes some data I understand that the standard event pattern convention is to declare it using the generic EventHandler delegate thuslyp  precodepublic event EventHandlerltSomethingHappendEventArgsgt SomethingHappend codepre  pWhere the specific codeSomethingHappendEventArgscode is declared something along the lines ofp  precodepublic class SomethingHappendEventArgs  EventArgs      public SomeDataType Value  get private set      public SomethingHappendEventArgsSomeDataType data              this.Value  data       codepre  pWhen googling around I noticed that there are several Microsoft namespaces that supplies a generic DataEventArgs class, including Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Events.

Negative 794 pstrongQuick Backgroundstrongbr I received code from a third party contracted software that I have to move onto my servers.

My problem only occurs when I try to run the applicationservices after I move them onto my server.p  pThe services or their respective references are at the heart of whats causing the issues. I created a test client to try to debug the services, and its accessing the service, but erroring when it tries to connect to the SQL Server inside the service.

Negative 794 pI have created a custom calendar, in which im setting the color for a single grid when it is clicked. My requirement is to change the color to some other color on second click. I tried achieving this by placing a onclick listener inside another onclick listener. It worked but its very buggy. sometimes the 2nd color stays in the previous grid or sometimes it doesnt work and sometimes it ll turn to second color when i click on a previously clicked grid.p  pMy requirement is to change the color of a grid to color1 on 1st click and color2 on second click on same grid cell.p

Negative 794 pI am currently stugling to understand just what is wrong with my app. p  pAs I was unable to find a solution more about that here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16440904codeigniterdownloadhelpercorrupts7zandrarfileshelporalternativesoluCodeigniter Download Helper corrupts .7z and .rar files help or alternative solutionsa I decided to take a different approach.p  pSo the question is what causes downloaded files via the HTML request if I said that right to become corrupt even when they are not corrupted when downloaded via FTP. And a follow up is, what causes a specific type of extension to become corrupt. Since I can download zip files fine but 7z and rar files get corrupted.p  pThis is the header list that codeiniters download helper usesp  precode        headerContentType .mime.         headerContentDisposition attachment filename.filename.         headerContentTransferEncoding binary         headerExpires 0         headerPragma nocache         headerContentLength .strlendata codepre  pThe helper uses filegetcontents in order to determine contentlength and send. I tried to use filesize and to send a file via readfile but the result was the same.p  pI also tried different mimes, from the all inclusive applicationoctetstream to the spefic ones depending on the type applicationx7zcompressed etc but it had little effect.p  pSo at this point I have no idea what causes some extensions to work while others do not.p  pAny suggestion is welcome.p  pIs there some php, or apache or any tweak, property I can use to change thisp  pEDITp  pI noticed that for some reason when I open a file there is a added number that represents an ID of the download i have no idea how it got here or how to stop it, but this have put me on the right track. Thanks so very much, i will update this one as I progress.p  pAlso how to prevent php to append something on top of my filep  pEDITp  pFOUND ITp  pIt was an obscure echo that I simply didnt see, I was just so tired. But now that it is gone everything works fine. Ive spend around hours truing to find out what was wrong, I am pissed of at myself, but right now I am glat it is over. Thanks so very much helping me find the problem p

Negative 794 pI have a client model which has many meetings.p  precodeclass Client lt ActiveRecordBase    hasmany meetings  end  class Meeting lt ActiveRecordBase    belongsto client  end codepre  pI want to produce an ActiveRecord query that will return clients sorted by order of the most recent meeting as determined by the meetingtime column, but have no idea how to do this. I obviously need to join the tables somehow but I dont know how to generate a suitable subquery in AR. How do I write a join that only includes 1 meeting for each client, in particular the most recent meeting i.e. the highest value for meetings.meetingtime for a given meetings.clientid. My database is PostgreSQL.p  pIve encountered similar problems to this previously, struggled with them, and obviously havent learned a lot from the process. A pointer to a good resource to learn about these sort of situations would also be appreciated.p
Negative 794 pI am testing a quite big project C, VS2012, and I need to arrange my unit test in test hierarchy eg. now I have 43 test cases. I do really need the hierarchy.p  pI have test categories defined already, and the test explorer shows test cases by traits. I have categories in this way one test have several categoriesp  ul liTestCase01 MainTestType, SubTestType, SubsubTestTypeli li...li liTestCase10 MainTestType, SubTestType, SubsubTestTypeli liTestCase11 MainTestType, SubTestType2, SubsubTestType2li li...li liTestCase15 MainTestType, SubTestType2, SubsubTestType2li ul  pDefined like thisp  precode    [TestMethod]     [TestCategoryMainTestType]     [TestCategorySubTestType]     [TestCategorySubsubTestType]     public void MyTestCase       etc.  codepre  pBut Test Explorer shows the nextp  ul liMainTestType all tests having category MainTestTypeli liSubTestType all tests having category SubTestTypeli lietc...li ul  pSo I really miss the hierarchy. I have tried Cat1Cat2Cat3 or even with . But no hierarchy displayed. Do you know how to do it, or a free addon which can do it for me p  pI also will need these type of categorization, because we run often tests from command line, and mstest.exe can run tests for one category eg all MainTestType, or SubTestType. I stick to mstest because half of the team uses vs2010. But the solution is enough for vs2012.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 794 pIm not sure if this is a addonextension issue but Im having a heck of a time with Visual Studio 2012 on two computers.  I believe it is DevExpress CodeRush causing the problems as it seems to work fine when I uninstall it but Im not 100 sure.p  pI startup VS 2012, answer YES to the Get Latest from TFS 2012 and the solution rightclick the solution node in the Solution Explorer and choose Project Dependencies...  it shows nothing checked.  Of course the build will fail.  I close and restart VS 2012 and then it shows.  I typically do this through the course of the DevExpress option to clear the solution cache which causes the solution to reload.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what may cause the project dependencies to get lost yet after a restart they are fine again  Is there something I need to delete and rebuild to try and resolve thisp

Negative 794 pAs we know, X86 CPU has a 64bit data bus. My understanding is that CPU cant access to arbitrary address. The address that CPU could access to is a integral multiple of the width of its data bus. For the performance, variables should start ataligned to these addresses to avoid extra memory access. 32bit variables aligned to 4Byte boundry will be automatically aligned to 8Byte64bit boundry, which corresponds to x86 64bit data bus. But why compilers align 128bit variables to 16Byte boundry Not the 8Byte boundryp  pThanksp  pLet me make things more specific. Compilers use the length of a variable to align it. For example, if a variable has 256bit length, Complier will align it to 32Byte boundry. I dont think there is any kind of CPU has that long databus. Furthermore, common DDR memories only transfer 64bit data one time, despite of the cache, how could a memory fill up CPUs wider databus or only by means of cachep

This callback method likely will not be executed because this       logout method is going to be called as the browser window is       closing.  Consequently, the RPC call will not return.

Negative 794 pThere are two classes, codeFoocode and codeBarcode, implementing some interface codeBazcode in my codeSeam 2.2.2code powered application. Im trying to establish a component of codeBazcode type conditionally implemented with one of these two classes. For this purpose Ive created a factory component, codeBazFactorycode, instantiating codeBazcode with codeFoocode or codeBarcode depending on a value of codeimplClassNamecode fieldp  precodepublic interface Baz ...  public class Foo implements Baz       In     String injectedValue1      ...   public class Bar implements Baz       In     String injectedValue2      ...

The only workaround Ive devised is to declare codeFoocode and codeBarcode as componentsp  precodeNamefoo ScopeScopeType.CONVERSATION public class Foo implements Baz       In     String injectedValue1      ...   Namebar ScopeScopeType.CONVERSATION public class Bar implements Baz       In     String injectedValue2      ...

For example, how would be scoped a component having codeScopeScopeType.CONVERSATIONcode in its declaration and codescope  ScopeType.SESSIONcode in declaration of a factory method instantiating this component like in the example above Furthermore, the workaround involves creating one more component for each codeBazcode implementation. Therefore this workaround looks ugly for me. Id prefer to use the first way, if there were a solution to the dependency injection problem described above.p  pIs there a way to inject dependencies into a factory instantiated componentp

Negative 794 pIm creating an AAC encoded m4a file from raw PCM samples for streaming purposes. Im using AAC hardware encoding provided in this example.  a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeiPhoneExtAudioFileConvertTestIntroductionIntro.html relnofollowiPhoneExtAudioFileConvertTestap  pNow I would really want to add metadata such as album artwork and titles. As I understand m4a or mp4 containers are MPEG4 Part 14. So the specified metadata format is XMP. However I do not know the good tool for working with XMP metadata. Any ideasp  pIm aware of Adobe XMP SDK, but it seems quite heavyweight, maybe there is a better solution for iOS. I mean, I doubt that its possible to do in AVFoundation, as XMP is Adobe technology, but maybe someone wrote a nice library especially for this purpose.  p

Thats because originally I was just embedding the hardcoded call to the static method inside of the loop. Instead of calling codetests[testIndex].runcode I would call codestaticMethod1quaternioncode explicitly there. That also meant redundantly duplicating this loop code for each method  which led me to creating the abstract base class so that I could essentially create an array of callbacks to test.p  h3Observationsh3  pSo, after switching to using the callback codeTestcode class, instead of calling the static function explicitly, I observed two thingsp  ul liThe execution times of each call increased greatlyli liThe execution times were not nearly as consistent.li ul  h3Static Resultsh3  pHere is a table of output from when I was calling the static methods explicitly all times in nano secondsp  precode1000    10000   100000  1000000  staticMethod1 315358  424208  1451141 14495864     125334  410525  1483797 14657896     125956  412079  1445543 14702681     150837  413012  1473845 14677179     126578  412080  1419419 14415313     126268  413323  1450830 14600361     125645  411457  1437147 14504261     126889  414257  1431548 14402563     129689  420476  1476954 14548734     848417  425453  1471046 14409715      staticMethod2 1528581 1031287 3137712 2180755  228899  303540  218947  2227406  228276  303228  218324  2232071  235118  301362  218324  2174224  226411  317534  218636  2180133  226410  302918  218946  2143434  253779  302606  219879  2116689  226099  349257  219880  2108913  240717  303228  218946  2150899  250358  303228  218946  2159607  codepre  h3Callback Resultsh3  pAnd here is the same code, only executed from my abstract base codeTestcode classp  precode1000    10000   100000  1000000  staticMethod1 360453  454686  1985445 15699447     155191  449400  1639298 15048205     152391  449089  1576165 15128134     175095  451888  1537289 15300429     156746  466816  1600734 15190645     157989  464950  1641476 15483610     157368  452198  1559681 15316290     157990  460285  1572122 15402439     157367  527773  1538222 15078995     878274  454065  1548485 15077439      staticMethod2 1519562 1101263 1674130 8842756  274616  335883  1481309 8728930  285190  339616  1471046 8842135  291721  334950  1280089 8591155  294831  347391  1339491 13402065     332152  343970  1299683 10950426     300429  326553  1252100 7778814  285190  324999  1365615 8569385  297008  341792  1284133 7734030  283324  326554  1327984 11505256 codepre  h2Question Revisitedh2  pThe only conjecture I was able to form was that perhaps this had something to do with the Java stack frame concept.

Negative 794 pI was wondering if you can have an action event in java occur when no action has taken place. What I mean is tricking it into thinking an action has occured when it has not and then running an action event. The reason I ask this is because it would seem like an easy run around to update things that run on the event dispatch thread without an actual event to occur. Let me know if any of you have heard about this. Thanks,p

Then destroy BackboneJS model for Jack at frontend.p  ul liBackboneJS Models for dependants will never know what happened to their corresponding records in the backend.

Negative 794 pThis thread is about 2 questions...p  pA part of my codemakefilecode is as followsp  precodelist       all             while IFS read r f              do                  .analyze f amp              done lt list.txt codepre  pcodelist.txtcode contains a list of filenames, then codemake listcode goes through the list and applies code.analyzecode to each file.p  pI often use codemake list gt output.txtcode to record everything that I print to codestdoutcode. In this case, nothing is shown in the terminal.p  pBut I just realized that I can not interrupt the execution. I tried codeCtrlCcode, codeCtrlDcode, or codeCtrlZcode, then the PC looks crash and nothing can be done.p  pThe reason I just realized that is previously I had a timer around the call of code.analyzecode. The code wasp  precodelist       all             while IFS read f              do                  .analyze f amp                  PID                  sleep 3 kill PID amp                  wait PID              done lt list.txt             sleep 3 codepre  pThen if a call with a file spends more than 3 seconds, it will be stopped, and next file will be carried on. In the terminal, it shows a list of codebinbash line 8 kill 2970  No such processcode for the call less than 3 seconds, and codebinbash line 9  2973 Terminated              .analyze fcode for those more than 3 seconds. The whole run can be interrupted by codeCtrlCcode though several times, and the output can be written to codeoutput.txtcode.p  pNow I realize that the timer is no longer necessary. So my question isp  p1 How could I modify codemakefilecode without timer or my OCaml code for code.analyzecode so that it could be interrupted.p  p2 For codemake list gt output.txtcode, How could I still print some simple information in the terminal while execution which allows me to see it progressesp

Negative 794 pIve created a program that processes images in c. For some reason, Ive made pretty much the most simple double for loop possible, and it refuses to work. This loop ends at x78 and y78, reliably every time. Ive been looking at this forever, and I can not figure it out Codep  precodetry        for int y  0 y lt inputHeight y                for int x  0 x lt inputWidth x                        if x  0 ampamp y  0                  continue              int xpix  x              int ypix  y              Color color  inputImage.GetPixelxpix, ypix              colorBucket[counter]  color.R              if counter lt byteSize  1                  colorBucket[counter  1]  color.G              if counter lt byteSize  2                  colorBucket[counter  2]  color.B              counter  3                         catch Exception e      System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Log1, Error, e.ToString  codepre  pVisual studio specifically tells me that both conditions are true, regardless of the fact that the loop has exited, and they are also true when looping. The size of colorBucket is huge, and the loop exits when count is about a third of the size of colorBucket through itself.

Negative 794 pa little understanding before i explain what this code is about, first the user will open a empty microsoft excel, and then the user will on a macro to open multiple workbook into the current active excel, for example, if the user chose to open book1 and book2 together, the current active excel will open them and split them into a new sheet named after the workbook it was currently named, example sheet book1 and sheet book2. p  pso basically this program enables user to search for a stringin all the sheets, and then after finding out where the string is, it copies the entire row  header to a new sheet named after the searching string.p  pFor example, if i search for apple, it will copy the entire row consists of the word  apple  and paste into a new sheet named apple and the row and header will be copied over there, what i need to do now is to create a new workbook and create a new sheet named after the search string AND the workbook it was previously named.p  pLike i said, ive opened workbook book1 and book2, and if the searched word is from sheet book1, the macro will copy the searched string into a new workbook, a new sheet named book1 with the information.p  pi know i had explained this in a very wordy way, let me know if you need any clarification.p  precode    Private Sub CommandButton5Click    Dim i As Long, nRowsAddePerSheet As Long, nRows As Long,      nRowsMax As Long, nSheets As Long   Dim strSearch, strSearch2   Dim rg As Range, rgF As Range   Dim wks   Dim x    strSearch  Application.InputBoxPlease enter the search string   strSearch2  ReplacestrSearch, ,    If LenstrSearch2 lt 0 Then     MsgBox ABandon Search string must not be empty.

Negative 794 pI have a requirement to read all messages in my Amazon SQS queue in 1 read and then sort it based on created timestamp and do business logic on it.p  pTo make sure all the SQS hosts are checked for messages, I enabled long polling. The way I did that was to set the default wait time for the queue as 10 seconds. Any value more than 0 will enable long polling.p  pHowever when I tried to read the queue, it still did not give me all the messages and I had to do multiple reads to get all the messages. I even enabled long polling through code per receive request, still did not work. Below is the code I am using.p  precodeAmazonSQSClient sqsClient  new AmazonSQSClientnew ClasspathPropertiesFileCredentialsProvider sqsClient.setEndpointsqs.uswest1.amazonaws.com String queueUrl  httpssqs.uswest1.amazonaws.com12345queueName ReceiveMessageRequest receiveRequest  new ReceiveMessageRequest.withQueueUrlqueueUrl.withMaxNumberOfMessages10.withWaitTimeSeconds20 ListltMessagegt messages  sqsClient.receiveMessagereceiveRequest.getMessages codepre  pI have 3 messages in the queue and each time I run the code I get a different result, sometimes I get all 3 messages, sometimes just 1. The visibility timeout I set as 2 seconds, just to eliminate the messages becoming invisible as the reason for not seeing them in the read. This is the expected behavior for short polling. Long polling is supposed to eliminate multiple polls. Is there anything I am doing wrong here p  pThanks    p

Negative 794 pI written a python script that spawns about 10 threads and doesnt waits for them. Whereas a thread is spawned, it creates a bash script and it runs it with subprocess.Popen. Then, the thread stops and exits. So basically, I have 10 threads that terminates in few seconds and then 10 subprocesses that are running. Every process has his code and its indipendent from the others.Once every process has terminated, a run of the script is completed. The script repeats each run for at least 15 times. The problem is that at the third run, the script stops and returns  [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory p  pThe strange thing is that the first two runs do their job perfectly.

Negative 794 pHi i am new to spring JPA . I have a table which has two columns namely activefrom and activeto.Now I would like to get a column which has a dateie.current date which has a value between activefrom and activeto.How to acheive this using spring jpa repositories.p
Negative 794 pIve got a fairly small C solution with about 5 projects in it. I am using Visual Studio 2012 with Update 4, and Resharper 8.1 build 8.1.23.546. Its on an I7 with an SSD and 16GB RAM, with oodles of disk space. Performance on this machine is fantastic for everything else.p  pI have R set to be my unit test runner, and Ive noticed that as soon as I run any unit tests one or many, pass or fail, makes no difference, the Visual Studio text editor becomes almost unusable. Typing into the editor window suffers such extreme lag up to 1 second between keystrokes that it completely breaks down the development flow. Sometimes I actually have to stop typing to let the keystrokes catch up so that I can look up something in Intellisense.p  pThe problem persists until I close down and then reopen VS, at which point everything is fine again. Until I run another unit test. Then its back again.p  pIve run Process Monitor to see if that turned up anything it didnt, and Ive tried various things like cleaning out various caches, temporary asp.net files, resetting settings, all to no effect, in fact basically pretty much all the options presented at a hrefhttpwww.google.com.ausearchqVisual20studio20201220typing20really20slowlyGoogle search results for VS being really slowap  pHowever, process of elimination did eventually narrow everything down to being a problem with Resharper, and specifically the test runner. p  pI then tried the R performance optimisation tips as described a hrefhttpconfluence.jetbrains.comdisplayNETCOMUltimateGuidetoSpeedingUpReSharper28andVisualStudio29here  The Ultimate Guide to speeding up Resharpera, and the only one that worked after many restarts was the disabling the Unit Test Runner.p  pIve since disabled the R test runner, and reverted to the builtin VS one which I hate, and the problem went away immediately. As soon as I reenable the R test runner, the problem comes back.p  pHas anyone else experienced this problem, and found a solutionp  pCheers p

Its in the function codeaddlocation..code under the check image if statement. p  precodeif result  thisgtmysqligtqueryquery      error[result]  thisgtsuccAddLoc  codepre  pI removed unnecessary functions in the filep  precodeltphp      class pongodev          var mysqli           Error handling variables         var errCatName         var errLatitude         var errLongitude         var errImage         var errPhone         var errWebsite         var succAddLoc         var succAddCat         var errEmail         var errPass         var succPass         var succEmail         var succEmailPass         var succResetPass         var errResetPass         var errUsername           Email configuration variables         var emailSubject         var resetMessage         var from         var adminEmail            Connect to database         function constructhost, user, pass, database              Connect to database             thisgtmysqli  new mysqlihost, user, pass, database              ifmysqliconnecterrnothisgtmysqli                 echo Failed to connect to MySQL  . mysqliconnecterror                                  Close database         function closedatabase             thisgtmysqligtclose                    Validate username and password         function validateuserusername, password             ......

Negative 794 pIm having great success so far using Mesos, Marathon, and Docker to manage a fleet of servers, and the containers Im placing on them.  However, Id now like to go a bit further and start doing things like automatically linking an haproxy container to each main docker service that starts, or provide other daemon based and containerized services that are linked and only available to the single parent container.p  pNormally, Id start up the helper service first with some name, then when I started the real service, Id link it to the helper and everything would be fine.  How does this model fit in to Marathon and Mesos though  It seems for now at least that the containerization assumes a single container.p  pI had one idea to start the helper service first, on whatever host it could find, then add a constraint to the real service that the hostname  helper services hostname, but that seems like itd cause issues with resource offers and race conditions for those resources.p  pIve also thought to provide an embed, or deeplink functionality to docker, or to the executor scripts that start the docker containers.p  pBefore I head down any of these paths, I wanted to find out if someone else had solved this problem, or if I was just horribly over thinking things.p  pThanksp

Negative 794 pI inherited a few web services that are WSDLs generated by ColdFusion 9.  The CF9 default is RPCencoded, so thats what they are.  However, its recently come to my attention that newer versions of the .NET framework or maybe its newer versions of Visual Studio dont like RPCencoded WSDLs. In testing in C, I verified that VS 2013 only properly consumed the service when it was in the documentliteral style.p  pIm of course open to changing the style to be more universally usable, but this web service has been in the wild for some time and is used by a number of people, Im sure, so I want to ensure I have a handle on what the possible repercussions might be. Im also wondering if its possible to get ColdFusion to generate two different WSDLs or allow setting of the encoding on the fly. Basically Id appreciate any advice on the best way to make this compatible while maintaining backwards compatibility. Thanks.p

Negative 794 pI wanted to write a little game in Android, since I have good Java experiancas I wrote it first in Java. Now I want to port the game, but unfortunately Android library does not support AffineTransform or Graphics2d.

Negative 794 pLike most people, were pretty impressed with BigQuery.  Were willing to put up with it being based on proprietary Dremel in exchange for not having to configure a ton of servers in our LAN, on EC2, or anywhere else.  p  pThe REST API is excellent, and were incorporating that into our apps, but we still find ourselves using the BQ Browser interface as well.  Wed like to incorporate something like a generic SQL window into our app, without divulging that the backend is BQ or that data is stored in Google at all, for that matter.  strongDoes Google provide a way to use their BQ browser tool in a whitelabel mannerstrong  p  pNote also, that even extending access to the existing browser tool is problematic.  It relies on useraccounts existing in ones own domain  something that cant be done, in our case, with a customers email address.  The REST interface solves this with servicelevel accounts, but that doesnt get you to the SQL windowbrowser tool.p  pIf the folks at Google are listening and I know that you are, consider the benefits of whitelabeling the browser tool  I think youd find a lot of software companies integrating it into their suites of products and, then, running circles around any HadoopCDHEMRImpalaHive combination.  p  pSo, to summarize  How does a software developer import or emulate the BQ browser tool with all its autocompletes, query histories, etc.. in their own webbased appp

Negative 794 pI have an R routine which creates a number of plots from a large set of data. Each plot is labeled with a titles describing the details of the set of points plotted. Unfortunately, I have not been able to use subscripts in the text if I am using paste to combine a complex label. The result is ugly. This is a simplified version of the code using data from R. The title shows the technique I am currently using, without subscripts. The attempt at an improved version is placed either on the x axis or on the plot.p  precodelibraryggplot2 x1  1 x2  2 list lt c14 tle lt pasteVGM  , as.characterlist[1],          V, VDM  , as.characterlist[2],          V, VGF  , as.characterlist[3],          V, VDF  , as.characterlist[4],          V, sep p lt ggplotmtcars, aesxwt, ympg    labstitletle    geompoint p p  xlabexpressionV[DM]  works fine p  xlabexpressionpasteV[DM],  3  works fine   now we would like to use a variable to provide the number  p  xlabexpressionpasteV[DM], , x1  Just displays x1, not value of x1 p  xlabexpressionpasteV[DM], ,                        as.characterx1  NO p  xlabexpressionpasteV[DM], ,                        as.characteras.numberx1  NO my.xlab1 lt bquoteV[DM]  .x1  p  xlabmy.xlab1  We can see the success here   A single variable at the end of the expression works  What if you wanted to display two variables  my.xlab2 lt bquoteV[GM]  .x2 my.xlab3 lt pastemy.xlab1, my.xlab2  p  xlabmy.xlab3  doesnt work   Apparently the expressions cannot be pasted together. Try another approach.  Place the two expressions separately on the plot. They no longer need to be  pasted together. It would look better, anyway. Would it work  p  annotatetext, x4, y30, labelAnnotatetext, parseTRUE   This is the idea  p  annotatetext, x4, y30, labelbquoteV[DM]  .x1, parseTRUE   This is a disaster  RStudio stops the process with a question mark placed on the console. Appears that  more input is being requested p  geomtextx4, y30, labelGeomtext  works p  geomtextx4, y30, labelmy.xlab1  does not accept variables. codepre  pI have included comments which describe the problems raised by each attempt. Ideally, the information should probably be placed as an annotation on the plot rather than as a title, but I cannot find a way to do this. Using a subscript turns a character into an expression, and it seems that there is a long list of functions which handle characters but not expressions.p

Negative 794 pI have three classes that can be combined statically. The lowestlevel class is codeAcode and is a template class with a single parameter. This could be, say, an int. Then I have a higherlevel class, codeBcode, which is dependent on the type codeTcode and codeAcode. Lastly, I have a higherstill class codeCcode which is dependent on codeTcode, codeAcode and codeBcode.p  pI can see two ways to code these relationships, either using template templates or publicscoped typedefsp  precode templatetemplate style template lttypename Tgt struct A    T at   template lttypename T,           template lttypenamegt class Agt struct B    AltTgt ba   T bt   template lttypename T,           template lttypenamegt class A,           template lttypename, template lttypenamegt classgt class Bgt struct C    BltT, Agt cb   AltTgt ca   T ct     publicscoped typedef style template lttypename Tgt struct A2    typedef T TType   T at   template ltclass Agt struct B2    typedef A AType   AType ba   typename ATType bt   template ltclass Bgt struct C2    typedef B BType   B cb   typename BAType ca   typename BATypeTType ct    ...  client code Altintgt MyA Bltint, Agt MyB Cltint, A, Bgt MyC  A2ltintgt myA2 B2ltA2ltintgt gt myB2 C2ltB2ltA2ltintgt gt gt myC2 codepre  pNow consider a new class D that extends the pattern  with the first approach, the template declaration becomes almost completely unmanageablep  precode horrendous to define template lttypename T,           template lttypenamegt class A,           template lttypename,                     template lttypenamegt classgt class B,           template lttypename,                     template lttypenamegt class,                     template lttypename, template lttypenamegt classgt classgt class Cgt struct D    CltT, A, Bgt dc   BltT, Agt db   AltTgt da   T dt    but nice to instantiate Dltint, A, B, Cgt MyD codepre  pThe advantage of the first approach is that each participating class does not need to make provisions for higherlevel classes. They do not need to be aware that they are part of a hierarchy so its possible to reuse existing classes without changing them. This feels scalable in theory, but the class declaration syntax quickly becomes practically impossible to deal with without resorting to horrible preprocessor macros.p  pAlternativelyp  precodetemplate ltclass Cgt struct D2    typedef C CType   lt not required right now, but better put it in justincase...   C dc   typename CBType db   typename CBTypeAType da   typename CBTypeATypeTType ct  codepre  pThis second approach is much more concise, however it requires that participants of the hierarchy make their template parameters available as public typedefd types. They need to cooperate at this compiletime interface so that they can communicate lowerlevel types up to higher levels. This requires widespread changes if they become part of such a hierarchy at a later date. This would seem to imply that it may be best to make strongallstrong template parameters in strongallstrong template classes available as publicscoped typedefs emjust in caseem they end up being used in this sort of hierarchy. This doesnt feel very scalable to me, but I have seen something similar in the Standard Library where the template parameter codevaluetypecode is often provided.p  pMy questions are  what other proscons of each approach have I missed, and which approach is likely to work best when creating a emgrowingem library of classes that tend to be combined statically like this Is one style more widely accepted than the other Are there alternatives not considered herep  pA note about practical applications  I have a realworld application of this already, which involves special types of numerical values that behave in certain ways. These values are wrapped in higherlevel classes that each provide a layer of extra functionality  one per layer. For example, one layer provides a callback mechanism, another provides caching, another provides value validation, another provides a transforming function. Higher layers may need to know about more than the layer directly beneath, hence the need for knowledge of types used to compose lower types. There are several different implementations at each level, hence the need to specify so many types. Various sections of this hierarchy can be used in other code, and in turn that code may find itself part of the hierarchy too. Its a fairly classic composition model that builds up functionality by composing lowerlevel classes, but created statically.p

Negative 794 pI currently am using ActionBars tab feature with multiple fragments each representing a tab.p  pOn my last fragment there is a Submit button that takes all the input that the user has done on all the fragments and submits it.p  pMy problem is that since those other fragments have been detached only the currently showing fragment is attached to the main view their view gets destroyed so cannot be accessed using the fragments findViewById.p  pHow can I access the data the user inputted for these fragments Interestingly, it does store all the inputted values in a bundle and restores them when the fragment is attached again, Im thinking the answer lies somewhere there...p

Negative 794 pI have a large series of git commits made during a pull request for a github project. Ive been asked to squash all of the commits together, however since then I have made an incredible mess of merges, resets and accidentally merging over other commits that Ive pulled to the repo whilst the PR has been underway.p  pWhat id like to be able to do, is simply copy the two files that are actually involved in the pull request to another directory, reset back to the very first commit I made for the PR, repaste my new files with the latest changes and then commit them, so that the PR shows up with a single commit.

Which can be a problem if you have a lot of data.li lisome characters are not supported like chinese characters will be gone after normalization and strippingli liambiguity which you get by stripping accents ie. two words zelo and elo have different meanings but will both turn up when searching.li ul  pHeres the Java code for itp  precode Gets you the ASCII version of unicode title which you insert into different column String titleAsciiName  Normalizer.normalizetitle, Normalizer.Form.NFD     .replaceAll[pASCII],  codepre

Negative 794 pI am trying to get the selected row in a PrimeFaces DataTable, but when the event is called on my bean, the value of the object is null. I have read some articles about this. It seems to be a problem related to the rowKey parameter. When I use the DataTable component without using a composite, I can get the object value normally. As far as I understand, when I use the composite, by default the view is of type Object. This means that the rowKey parameter cannot be assigned to item.id because the type Object does not has an attribute called id. After doing a deeper investigation, I found out that the problem starts on method queueEvent on DataTable class.p  precodeOverride public void queueEventFacesEvent event      FacesContext context  getFacesContext      ifisRequestSourcecontext ampamp event instanceof AjaxBehaviorEvent          setRowIndex1         MapltString,Stringgt params  context.getExternalContext.getRequestParameterMap         String eventName  params.getConstants.RequestParams.PARTIALBEHAVIOREVENTPARAM         String clientId  this.getClientIdcontext         FacesEvent wrapperEvent  null          AjaxBehaviorEvent behaviorEvent  AjaxBehaviorEvent event          ifeventName.equalsrowSelecteventName.equalsrowSelectRadioeventName.equalscontextMenu                 eventName.equalsrowSelectCheckboxeventName.equalsrowDblselect              String rowKey  params.getclientId  instantSelectedRowKey             wrapperEvent  new SelectEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, this.getRowDatarowKey                   else ifeventName.equalsrowUnselecteventName.equalsrowUnselectCheckbox              String rowKey  params.getclientId  instantUnselectedRowKey             wrapperEvent  new UnselectEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, this.getRowDatarowKey                  else ifeventName.equalspage              int rows  this.getRowsToRender             int first  Integer.parseIntparams.getclientId  first             int page  rows gt 0  int first  rows  0              wrapperEvent  new PageEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, page                  else ifeventName.equalssort              SortOrder order             UIColumn sortColumn              ifisMultiSort                  String[] sortDirs  params.getclientId  sortDir.split,                 String[] sortKeys  params.getclientId  sortKey.split,                  order  SortOrder.valueOfsortDirs[sortDirs.length  1]                 sortColumn  findColumnsortKeys[sortKeys.length  1]                           else                  order  SortOrder.valueOfparams.getclientId  sortDir                 sortColumn  findColumnparams.getclientId  sortKey                           wrapperEvent  new SortEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, sortColumn, order                  else ifeventName.equalsfilter              wrapperEvent  new FilterEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, getFilteredValue, getFilters                  else ifeventName.equalsrowEditeventName.equalsrowEditCanceleventName.equalsrowEditInit              int rowIndex  Integer.parseIntparams.getclientId  rowEditIndex             setRowIndexrowIndex             wrapperEvent  new RowEditEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, this.getRowData                  else ifeventName.equalscolResize              String columnId  params.getclientId  columnId             int width  Integer.parseIntparams.getclientId  width             int height  Integer.parseIntparams.getclientId  height              wrapperEvent  new ColumnResizeEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, width, height, findColumncolumnId                  else ifeventName.equalstoggleSelect              boolean checked  Boolean.valueOfparams.getclientId  checked              wrapperEvent  new ToggleSelectEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, checked                  else ifeventName.equalscolReorder              wrapperEvent  behaviorEvent                  else ifeventName.equalsrowToggle              boolean expansion  params.containsKeyclientId  rowExpansion             Visibility visibility  expansion  Visibility.VISIBLE  Visibility.HIDDEN             String rowIndex  expansion  params.getclientId  expandedRowIndex  params.getclientId  collapsedRowIndex             setRowIndexInteger.parseIntrowIndex              wrapperEvent  new ToggleEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, visibility, getRowData                  else ifeventName.equalscellEdit              String[] cellInfo  params.getclientId  cellInfo.split,             int rowIndex  Integer.parseIntcellInfo[0]             int cellIndex  Integer.parseIntcellInfo[1]             int i  1             UIColumn column  null              forUIColumn col  this.getColumns                  ifcol.isRendered                      i                      ifi  cellIndex                          column  col                         break                                                                 wrapperEvent  new CellEditEventthis, behaviorEvent.getBehavior, rowIndex, column                   wrapperEvent.setPhaseIdevent.getPhaseId          super.queueEventwrapperEvent          else          super.queueEventevent       codepre  pIn the following line the rowKey value is not foundp  precodeString rowKey  params.getclientId  instantSelectedRowKey codepre  pInstead of this, I have the id of the selected lines in a key called selection clientId  selection.

Negative 794 pSo I want to hide the navbar when scrolling down and bring it back when scrolling up. Hiding it works perfectly with p  precodeself.navigationController.hidesBarsOnSwipe  true codepre  pBut I expect it to be shown again when scrolling up. I made a test project where the view controller just has a single UICollectionView that covers the whole screen. Then showing the navbar is shown again as expected until I add this line to the viewDidLoad adding cells to the collection viewp  precodeself.collectionView.delegate  self codepre  pAnd this is what the whole view controller looks likep  precodeclass ViewController UIViewController,UICollectionViewDataSource, UICollectionViewDelegate   IBOutlet var collectionView UICollectionView override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad     self.collectionView.dataSource  self     self.collectionView.delegate  self     self.collectionView.registerClassUICollectionViewCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier Test     self.navigationController.hidesBarsOnSwipe  true   func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section Int gt Int      return 3   func numberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView gt Int      return 1   func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UICollectionViewCell      return collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifierTest, forIndexPath indexPath as UICollectionViewCell   func collectionViewcollectionView UICollectionView, layout collectionViewLayout UICollectionViewLayout, sizeForItemAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt CGSize      return CGSizeMake300, 300   codepre  pSo why does showing the navbar stop working when I add cells to my collection viewp

Negative 794 pIm building a small php application which stores calendar events in a database, as well as the googleid for the event generated by the Calendar API. Id like to update the database with the new values of the events as changed by the user directly in the Calendar UI, I therefore try to retrieve the event records by their google IDs. To this, I use the get method of the events class. The problem is if an event is deleted from google altogether, the method throws an exception and the script stops running. Anyone has any idea why there isnt a return value for failure in this method How to work around Thanks in advance.p

Negative 794 pI am trying to program a card game but when I want to show the card going from one players hand to the others, I run into an issue. It seems that since the card is inside of a layout, when I try to translate it to outside of the layouts boarders it disappears. I was hoping to have it be able to translate all the way to the bottom of the screen past the layout the card is contained in, and over 3 layouts.p  pThe card is a Button object, and its inside of a LinearLayout. I was thinking that one solution might be that Id have to reconstruct the project using a RelativeLayout but Im afraid thatll make it more difficult to optimize the application for all android device sizes. I think that sticking with LinearLayouts will significantly reduce the time I need to spend on optimzing for different screen sizes. If this isnt possible to achieve with LinearLayouts, thatd be unfortunate but if it is please let me know p

Negative 794 pI am having a strange problem with a game Im making.  I will apologize in advance, since Im new to AS3, so have patience with me  p  pI will start by explaining how my game worksp  pFirst it adds a main menu screen, on which there is a start button. When you press the start button, the main menu gets removed, and it adds a level screen. So there is 3 buttons on the level screen, each representing its own level, and you can only see button 2 if you have finished the first level, etc.. p  pWhen I press one of the buttons, the game adds the character movieclip and the world movieclip. All the levels are in the world movieclip, so the first level is on frame 1, and the second on frame 2, etc..p  pSo if I press button1 it goessimplifiedp  paddChildworld world.gotoAndStop1p  pBut heres the problem, SOMETIMES it goes to frame 3 instead of frame one. But when I close it down and try again it works fine. It sometimes does this a few times in a row.  When the game goes to frame 1 as its supposed to, there is no problems with the rest of the game.p  pHas anyone experienced this, or know whats causing itp  pRelevant codep  precodepackage        import flash.display.MovieClip     import flash.events.Event     import flash.events.MouseEvent     import flash.geom.Point     import flash.ui.GameInput       public class Main extends MovieClip           public var characterCharacter         public var mainMenuMainMenu         public var backGroundBackGround         private var dangersDangers         public var worldMapWorldMap         public var worldLevelint         public var currentLevelint            public function Main               worldLevel  1              backGround  new BackGround             world  new World             dangers  new Dangers             gameOverScreen  new GameOverScreen             worldMap  new WorldMap              mainMenu  new MainMenu             addChildmainMenu              character  new Character                eventlisteners               addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveWorld              mainMenu.PlayButton.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, gotoWorldMap               world buttons              worldMap.buttonWorld1.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, gotoWorld1             worldMap.buttonWorld2.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, gotoWorld2             worldMap.buttonWorld3.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, gotoWorld3                    function go to world map         function gotoWorldMap mMouseEventvoid                      mainMenu.parent.removeChildmainMenu             addChildworldMap                    function world 1          function gotoWorld1 mMouseEventvoid                      addChildbackGround              addChildworld             world.gotoAndStop1               addChildcharacter             character.x  300             character.y  460             character.gotoAndStop3               worldMap.parent.removeChildworldMap                                       world.worldDangers.gotoAndStop1             world.SafeGround.gotoAndStop1             world.WorldWalls.gotoAndStop1               currentLevel  1              addChildgamePanel                    function world 2          function gotoWorld2 mMouseEventvoid                   same as gotoWorld1, it just goes to frame 2 instead.                    function world 3          function gotoWorld3 mMouseEventvoid                   same again          codepre

Negative 794 pI am facing a big problem with my sessions in a Django project.p  pThe backend is hosted at code.mydomain.orgcode and the frontend consumes the REST API of the backend at code.frontend.comcode. In the future, other frontends on completely different domains might appear.p  pHow do I deal with such a situation when I use the session framework provided by Django It seems like codeSESSIONCOOKIEDOMAINcode only allows session cookies to be set on strongonestrong subdomain. The result is that if I want to be able to login at code.mydomain.orgcode i.e., codeSESSIONCOOKIEDOMAIN  Nonecode then I am not able to receive the session cookie back from code.frontend.comcode when it calls API endpoints. On the other hand, setting codeSESSIONCOOKIEDOMAINcode to code.frontend.comcode would prevent me to connect to the site admin. The situation is also impacted by codeSESSIONCOOKIEPATHcode of course...p  pAny help is more than welcome. I am quite sure Im not the first one who needs a REST API with session authentication to be accessible from external domains.p
Negative 794 pI currently have a webapi which I am trying to implement Dependency Injection with.

Negative 794 pI have a simple EmberCLI addon which provides a few helper Mixins. This addon is meant to be consumed by a set of addons which all want to do userinterface things react to size changes, field validation, etc..p  pSo in essence there is a three step chainp  ol listrongEmber CLI Applicationstrong consumes UI Ember Addonli listrongUI Addonstrong consumes Mixin Addon to gain access to a common features libraryli listrongMixin Addonstrong provides a set of emMixinsem to consumersli ol  pIf I put the emMixinsem implementation into the codeappmixinscode directory than the strongUI Addonstrong can import these mixins with an import to code..mixins[mixinname]code. That works but when I try and move back to the actual Ember App it can no longer resolve the mixins. p  pI guess thats not surprising really and what I want to be able to do instead is reference the mixins directly, like so codeuimixinlibrarymixins[mixinname]code. Unfortunately the resolver is not able to resolve this. p  pIn order to help achieve this goal I have put all the mixins into the codeaddonmixinscode directory  and as the EmberCLI page suggests  I import and then export these in the corresponding codeappmixinscode folder. Doesnt seem to help.

Negative 794 pI am implementing some code from Google the codeSlidingTabLayoutcode and codeSlidingTabStripcode, found easily online and Im trying to use it with codeViewPagercode to get sliding tabs in my codeFragmentcode. The thing is, I am using codePagerAdaptercode as an extension in my main tab fragment class, which is used for my adapter to show the view of whats in the tabs. I am able to get a basic view of the tabs working in my fragment codeCuteCollectionFragment.javacode, but when I click on them, they take usually 2 clicks for the new tab to be highlighted, plus you cannot swipe to get to the new tab. My suspicion is that because the base code, which is normally meant for a main activity, must be put in a codeFragmentcode because of my codeNavigation Drawercode, it is conflicting with my codeNavigation Drawercode, which is already sliding. But thats just a guess. p  pBasically, I must use codeFragmentscode, not activities. But how are they conflicting and how do I fix that All examples online I found want you to use codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode instead of codePagerAdaptercode as the extension for my adapter, but I cant do that because it requires you to use a codeFragmentManagercode that is support v.4. I cant use that in my codeCuteMainActivitycode the one that has my nav drawer code because then I cant click on each nav drawer menu item and go to a codeFragmentcode, I get red errors on my switch statement on the codeFragment fragmentcode part, which says my fragments must all extend codeFragmentActivitycode, but they cant with a nav drawer, they MUST extend codeFragmentcodep  pAnyway, gosh this is so confusing. Mainly I just want to know 2 thingsp  ol lipWhy are my tabs not sliding and why do they require 2 clickspli lipHow do I hook up my inner codeTabsAdaptercode class to show my tab classes which are all codeFragmentscode.

Negative 794 pSo Im at a bit of a loss on how I can set this up. I have a program that i marshal into memory As a anti decompiling measure and run it. Thar works fine. However I now wish to include some code that id like to share, and some that id like not to share.p  pFor instance i have a Settings class that that has a few static variables that gets populated from a init method that takes a argument of SettingClass that handles reading and writing to the file.p  precodePublic Class Settings     Public Shared somesetting As String      Public Shared Sub InitByRef sett As SettingFile        somesetting  sett.ReadValuegroup, somthing     End Sub End Class codepre  pIts a little weird yes, but it makes the code easyer to read from the main program asp  precodeSetting.somesetting codepre  pThat is just an example as there may be a few dozen variables. This too also works fine, up until i started cleaning up the code, as i took this class and a few others and compiled them into a dll. Aslong as the dll is in the same folder, it works fime. Therein lies the problem, when this is deployed i will not be able to have the dll in the folder with the program.p  pWhat i have tried is setting up the settings file to be a list and then just pass along the information as command line arguments and calling somthing likep  precodeSetting.getValSomething codepre  pThat too also worked, but the other person working on the project found it difficult to remember so it had to be removed.p  pThe next thing i have tried is embedding the dll, but that just dosnt seem to work. As soon as i remove the dll from the folder, complains it cant find it even tho it would have been linked in as a resource.p  pMy current idea is to use some form of MarshalingThink thats the right term to load the dlls into memory during initialization by downloaindg them as bytestreams and poping them directly into memory.p  pFor instance in the main.p  precodeSub main     AddHandler AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve, AddressOf ResolveAssemblies     Console.WritelineSettings.something No import of setting classes was made uptop. End Sub  Function ResolveAssembliessender As Object, args As System.ResolveEventArgs As System.Reflection.Assembly     Dim domain As AppDomain  DirectCastsender, AppDomain      Dim rawAssembly As Byte  dlByteArrayFromWebserverCommon.dll     Dim rawSymbolStore As Byte  ldlByteArrayFromWebserverCommon.pdb     Dim myAssembly As System.Reflection.Assembly  domain.LoadrawAssembly, rawSymbolStore      Return myAssembly End Function codepre  pThis would solve my problem, but i cant seem to get it to play nice with Visual Studios, I make the references in the application properties and i can access the data members, however sense i dont copy the dll into the folder with it, it complains it cant find it, even before i can try to load it into memory.p  pAnd the reason for such... Extreme methods is because i know the end users will be malicious. they will try to decompile the code in almost any way they can. Its not a matter of making it impossible to figure out, but just difficult. Not only that but my partner who is also working on this with me only knows vb.net so thats the reason for that.p  pSo my Question is, any idea why this isent working From my understanding the handler should proc as soon as the program tries to load the missing dependency thus retrieving it. As well as ideas for different setups if this is too... terrible of a design.p  pInfop  precodelauncher.exe lt free to give out, and uses the settings.dll in the same folder  privateprogram.exe lt never want it to touch the hdd. knows the location of settings.dll and needs to load it in to run. it also needs private.dll which it gets the bytesteam from the server codepre  pYea i know, its a weird setup. but this is how it needs to be.p

Negative 794 pI have problems saving an ImgView32 layer as a TRANSPARENT PNG. I use the code from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6949094howtosaveapngfilewithtransparencythis questiona to do the saving. However, the image saves with a white background.p  pHere is how I initialize my ImgView32, create a layer on it, and then draw a line on itp  precodeprocedure TputLine.FormCreateSender TObject var   P TPoint   W, H Single   imwidth integer   imheight integer begin   imwidth  Iv1.Width   imheight  Iv1.Height   with iv1 do   begin     Selection  nil     Layers.Clear     Scale  1     Scaled  True     Bitmap.DrawMode  dmTransparent     Bitmap.SetSizeimwidth, imheight     Bitmap.Canvas.Pen.Width  4   end   BL  TBitmapLayer.Createiv1.Layers   try     BL.Bitmap.DrawMode  dmTransparent     BL.Bitmap.SetSizeimwidth,imheight     BL.Bitmap.Canvas.Pen.Width  penwidth     BL.Bitmap.Canvas.Pen.Color  pencolor     BL.Location  GR32.FloatRect0, 0, imwidth, imheight     BL.Scaled  False   except     BL.Free     raise   end end codepre  pSo iv1 is the name of my ImgView32. Then I draw a line on it using this codep  precodevar    bm32TBitmapLayer   ... begin   bm32iv1.Layers[0] as TBitmapLayer.Bitmap   bm32.canvas.pen.colorclwhite   bm32.canvas.brush.colorclwhite   bm32.canvas.rectangle0,0,bm32.width1, bm32.height1    bm32.canvas.Pen.ColorWinColorColorPickerGTK1.SelectedColor   bm32.canvas.brush.colorclWhite   bm32.Canvas.Pen.Width3   bm32.Canvas.MoveTo0,bm32.Height   bm32.Canvas.LineTo0150,bm32.Height250 end codepre  pIf I use the clWhite32 for the above code when drawing the rectangle, then when saving the PNG, the background of the imgView turns black... So I do not understand the problem really.p  pI do the saving like thisp  precodeprocedure TputLine.Button2ClickSender TObject var   myLayTBitmapLayer begin   mylay  iv1.Layers.Items[0] as TBitmapLayer   SavePNGTransparentXmylay.Bitmap end codepre  pand the actual saving code from the link described abovep  precodeprocedure TPutLine.SavePNGTransparentXbm32TBitmap32 var   Y Integer   X Integer   Png TPortableNetworkGraphic32    function IsWhiteColor32 TColor32 Boolean   begin     Result TColor32EntryColor32.B  255 and              TColor32EntryColor32.G  255 and              TColor32EntryColor32.R  255   end  begin     bm32.ResetAlpha     for Y  0 to bm32.Height1 do       for X  0 to bm32.Width1 do       begin         if IsWhitebm32.Pixel[X, Y] then           bm32.Pixel[X,Y]Color32255,255,255,0       end     Png TPortableNetworkGraphic32.Create     Png.Assignbm32     Png.SaveToFileCThisShouldBeTransparent.png     Png.Free end codepre  pI do not understand why it does not save the layer as transparent PNG. How can I fix it Any idea is welcome.p  pYou can replicate my problem using the above code. It uses GR32PNG and GR32PortableNetworkGraphic. You only need to add a TImgView32 control to your form and add the code listed above.p
Negative 794 pHeres a topic that seems a bit hard to find information on.  Do I need to update  futureproof the codecomposer.jsoncode file that comes with Symfony as the approximate versions stray farther and farther away from the actual latest versions  p  pIs this just left to an etiquette or preference thing  I hope not, because as a developer its hard enough to maintain standards. I would like to see some concrete rules in the codecomposer.jsoncode coderequirecode regarding the way versions are read and indicated.p  pe.g. what do I do when my composer.json says p  precoderequire      symfonysymfony 2.4,     doctrineorm 2.2,gt2.2.3, codepre  pbut downloads Doctrine 7.4 and Symfony 4.3 instead  Is this okay  Or do I need need to maintain my composer.json filep  pComposer.lock is for this you say  What is composer.lock Its a file I dont need to adjust, not interested in looking at, and dont want to edit.  Thats the conclusion i hold on composer.lock.  p  pCompatible with symfony Entries like this drive me a bit batty, codeknplabsknpmenubundle 2.0.dev,code  dev  I would love to see that gone. And how do I know which packages are which, i.e. how do I know if I need a name like 2.0.devcodewhich has the version, and a phase tag dev, orcodedevmasterwhich states no version number, I think I like this one the best, but then you will have complicated version mismatch issues, so this might not be a good standard at all, there is no standards there.   p  pMind you, I dont need an explanation as to why the package is only available as dev, I realize its not a completed work yet.  This isnt my point.p  pBack to keeping the composer.json file itself updated, does it really boil down having to Googling every one of these packages, every couple months, looking over at package gist, npm, and git hub repo documentations, just to find that elusive version number, guess at it to take the risk that youre looking at the right website, latest code release, then update your composer.json file with that number, after you verify it is compatible with all other packages  I mean, isnt that what a package manager is supposed to do for me  p  pThe best documentation I have seen for version compat info is the chart here a hrefhttpbootstrap.braincrafted.comgettingstarted.htmlrequirements relnofollowhttpbootstrap.braincrafted.comgettingstarted.htmlrequirementsa.  It would be great if all current mainstream open source packages can adopt this compatibility chart idea like this, at least if they are able to be installed by composer.json who does have an implemented version check system within.   p  pSo shouldnt my attention be to composer.json periodically to make sure it contains the correct version numbers  I mean, its easy to ignore, but I think this will be fatal, and not ignoring it is why I have just created this post. What is the correct way to go about maintaining the composer.json, and what few resources are available for thisp  pAnyway cant I find a default composer.json file anywhere  It would be great to see one for each new Symfony release so I can just update the top default Symfony requires easily at least X.p  h2Further related questionsh2  pPHP, true, I was entirely overlooking the PHP one, thanks for pointing that out. So that states the compatible version. Notice, I removed the PHP portion of the question and revised it to an example using Doctrine and Symfony instead.p  pAs far as declaring 2.4 will not install anything over 2.x, I think is what youre saying, this is what I had hoped to hear. This is great to know for surep  pThe test suite, again, something I havent used in the Symfony package. Thus far i have been relying on web drivers.p  pAhh, codepreferlowestcode What does this verify, that the versions that I do have specified are at least compatible with each otherp  pSo on your next point, you mention below the compat chart comment, about if its a dependency it belongs in required section, if its not dependency it should not be placed in coderequiredcode, rather just add the files directly to codeappresourcescodep  pYou ask what purpose would it have to have a default composer.json file. If I had one to refer to, I would know that the edits that have slowly made their way to my configs over the last two years havent completely caused the breakage that Im experiencing right now. I just want to see some solid ground, and possible even revert my file back, delete vendors, and web, and composer installupdate to see if things start working again, then add one package back at a time. I cant do this right now, because I have no way to reference what I have against what works.  p  pAre you saying I can generate a fresh with composer init I totally forgot about this. Great point.p  pAnother point you made below the codecomposer initcode about semantic versioning major version increment.  I didnt realize that this was a standard practice to jump to the next number block when something goes out of compat. I dont know why I hadnt correlated that in the past.p

Negative 794 pDuring my programming practice I very often become faced with a problem of data duplication between clientside and serverside scripts.  In this context we can talk about Javascript on cleintside and PHP or C ASP.NET on serverside.p  pLets say, I have a JavaScript code that defines a constant or array, or object with specific data. E.g. it can be data that references to app business rules. This data also should be used at backend and I have to define this constant in appropriate script.p  pAnd in this moment, when we defined the second variable, we have violated the principle Dont repeat yourself. For now, when I change this constant on frontend, I have to change this constant on backend too. p  pAnd amount of coupled in this way data can grow up, and my code will be very hard to maintain in future.p  pSo, my question is next is there any ways, or good practices to follow DRY principles in context of clientserver communication For example, is it good practice to keep this kind of data in .settings files and read it both on frontend and backendp

Negative 794 pIve been googling for the better part of 4 hours and nothing Ive tried has had any effect. This is your typical codeJAVAHOMEcode while configuring android studio on a machine for the first time problem it would appear. Ive added literally everything to environment variables and path that I can think of. Ive tried reinstalling JREJDKAndroid Studio many many times. Ive tried deleting code.androidcode and code..LocalTemp itemscode. Ive tried running codeandroid.batcode as admin. Nothing helps.p  pI can run codefindjava64.execode directly and it actually gives me the correct path, but in the batch file it says it cant find that file. The only thing I noticed is that it says code...LocalAndroidsdktoolslibfindjava64.exe scode with two slashes instead of one after lib. That seems strange but not like it should cause it to not find it... and if I copypaste the entire path with executable from the error line into command prompt including the two slashes it DOES show the JDK location correctly. p  pWhy does the script not work if the line works in isolation I cant do anything if this batch file isnt going to work.p  pEdit Ive been trying some more today. The core issue seems to be that when batch files are attempting to run other scriptsexecutables, windows always throws a is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. error. Ive been tracing this through script after script from android.bat to findjava.bat. If I manually execute the command the batch file is trying to execute in command prompt, it works fine, but the batch file says its wrong. Another suspicious thing seems to be that I cannot double click on ANY batch files in the computer. I can only open them as admin or from command prompt. Starting to think this is a very computerspecific problem.p

Negative 794 pI have a struct that contains a slice and I would like to use it as a key to a map. I understand that this is not allowed because equality is not currently defined for slices in Go. I also know that I cant override equality for the struct to do the slice comparison by hand.

Negative 794 pLets say I instantiate multiple crawlers for the same URL. They write URLs that are processed to MySQL database. Before processing URL, they check in database if record for that page exists, so it wouldnt process already processed page again.p  pHere is the catch, there should exist some kind of lock, so that only one of them can read or write from that specific table, if my logic is right. So, I instantiated only one database connection JDBC for them to use. Still, I am unsure if this is right thing to do.p  pSo my question is do statements executed from single database connection run sequentiallyare they queued or does this depend on database engine its configuration.p
Negative 794 pI need a system as such  they have sales, project management and service management. Each different type of employee should be able to see all information from other employees but only be able to modify the specific information for their job example is sales cant modify the project management information but can view it. To twist this up a little more, they have multiple locations and only those locations can access data specific to that location.p  pSince I am most versed in C I will be using this as the language to tie it all in together.p  pI have a few different ideas on how to do this and have no idea what would be the best solution to get this all done.p  pMy current idea is for the database...p  precodeCREATE TABLE Employee    EmployeeID INT, PK   EmployeeRole INT, FK   LocationID INT FK  codepre  pThen, each query in the code would be specific to their EmployeeRole and LocationID. I am assuming I would manually create each user they only have about 15 employees, assign them the values and then have the backend code tie the queries together.p  pDifficulty with this is that these system queries are going to get pretty nasty at least for me, I am not a DBA and have never done something like this. p  pSo for example, if I wanted to display.. lets say ProspectiveClients Table for a specific location I would...and this is roughly my ideap  precodeSELECT  FROM ProspectiveClients     INNER JOIN Employee on ProspectiveClients.LocationID  Employee.LocationID codepre  pOr something to that effect.. And then to update or insert data, the query would contain in insert statements that EmployeeRole has to equal whatever value I assign it. Of course them poses the questions...p  ol lipWould each time an employee insert client information they have to add the locationid as well I imagine I can just have a drop down they can select that the location name will equal the locationID... but then there is room for error on the users parts. Or I suppose I could have it set up in the query that the clients LocationID will equal whatever the employees LocationID is. pli lipAm I going about to right way doing this Is this all needing to be controlled in the backend code Or is there something on the database end that is easier to do this. What I mean by this question is this making sense to anyone the way I am thinking or should I just go find a DBA to hire.pli ol

Negative 794 pI am trying to make a contact form in Blogger. The default contact form widget exists and works like a charm, but it only provides 3 fields. Name, email and message. I needed more fields added. Adding more fields to the widget is impossible, since there are specific tags that the widget accepts, that correspond to the three fields datacontactFormNameMsg for the name, datacontactFormEmailMsg for the email and datacontactFormMessageMsg for the message.p  pSo, the solution was to create my own form. I did not want to use the actionmailto because I dont want windows jumping up, Outlook or Mail starting and tabs getting opened. So, I had to use .php to control the sending of the form. I wrote my .php code. So, since Blogger does not provide the option to host your .php file, I had to look elsewhere for hosting. I googled it. And I was directed to the use of Google Drive as the best option to host a .php file for Blogger. So I tried it. I tried the steps described a hrefhttpssupport.google.comdriveanswer2881970hlen relnofollowherea and everywhere else on the web, but as this page says and it must be a new addition, because all other unofficial and most probably outdatedsites claim to be able to host their .php files on Google Drivep  pGoogle Drive does not support web resources that make use of serverside scripting languages like PHP.p  pI tried Dropbox. But, as answered a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28444897hostphpsiteondropboxherea, Dropbox doesnt support serverside execution of your PHP scripts either. All these must be new, because every blogger suggests Dropbox and Google Drive as the best options for hosting .php files.p  pThen, I tried a hrefhttpwww.000webhost.com relnofollow000webhosta. It worked. My .php script ran and I received the form in my email, BUT big big BUT on clicking the button that triggered the action and the .php, the user is also redirected to the first page of 000webhost.p  pI tried hosting it on another free web hosting service, but the same thing happened. The moment the user clicked the Send button on my form, they were redirected to the first page of the free webhosting service.p  pI thought of adding the php code inline html php code php but I did not know how to refer to it.p  pSo, I have two questionsp  ol lipHow could I refer to an inline part of php code, in my html code Remember, we are on Blogger, that little is allowed. I want to refer to the php code from the form action part.pli lipWhy does the Send button redirects the user to the front page of the free webhosting service Is it the Free webhosting services way of advertising itself I mean, is it implemented in the service Is there something wrong with my codepli ol  pMy php code is thisp  precodeltphp  errors   myemail  mymailmymail.com ifemptyPOST[name]       emptyPOST[email]      emptyPOST[message]      errors . n Error all fields are required   name  POST[name]  emailaddress  POST[email]  message  POST[message]   if pregmatch [az09].[az09][az09].[az09].[az]2,3i,  emailaddress  errors . n Error Invalid email address   if emptyerrors      to  myemail      emailsubject  Contact form submission name     emailbody  You have received a new message. .

Negative 794 pWe currently use a hrefhttpdocs.behat.orgenlatest relnofollowBehat 3a to automate BDD tests for our website.p  pThe current setup uses a hrefhttpsjenkinsci.org relnofollowJenkinsa to run a hrefhttpwww.seleniumhq.org relnofollowSeleniuma which attaches to a hrefhttpswww.mozilla.orgenGBfirefoxnew relnofollowFirefoxa and uses a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXvfb relnofollowXVFBa to render this allows us to save screenshots when anything goes wrong.p  pThis is great for testing that the site including JavaScript works and that a user can perform each documented task successfully.p  pI am looking to expand our testing facilities, and one thing I would like to add is the ability to check multiple browsers. This is very important as we get occasional quirks that can break functionality.p  pSince the tests currently take slightly over an hour to run and we have 4 suites for that site on Jenkins, Id preferably like to run all the browsers at the same time. If I cant find a way to do it concurrently, then I likely will just set up multiple Behat profiles and run each one in series.p  pOne thing Ive been looking at as a possible solution is a hrefhttpvanamco.comghostlab relnofollowGhostlaba. This would allow us to test across, multiple browsers and multiple devices, including mobile, at the same time. The problem is that I cant find a way of joining this to Behat in a meaningful way.p  pI could run one browser connected to Ghostlab, which would cause the same actions to be taken across all connected browsers, however, were a browser other than the one controlled by Selenium to break, I do not know how we would capture that information.p  pTLDR Is there any way for me to run BDD preferable Behat tests across multiple browsers in parallel, and capture information from any browser that failsp

Basically its like I have 2 ballsdivs, one of them is on top 100px and the other ball is on top 500px  not actual values, just random ones , and what I want to achieve is, when I press Space, the ball that is on top 500px, goes up to the top 100px, and the other one does the opposite  goes from top 100px, to top 500px, but with a cycle condition, like having speed, like a for that gives  2px or more to the div until she reaches top 500px, and vice versa.p  pI hope you understand what Im trying to make here, a hand would be really appreciated.p

Negative 794 pI have come into a problem recently when trying to rotate 3D objects. I am building a GUI and I have a separate figure where an object is plotted. In the figure, I allow the user to use MATLABs builtin rotate button to move the object around. However, I am unable to have the light also follow the rotation as it seems to be fixed on one part of the object. To create the light, I am usingp  precodeccamlightright setc,style,infinite codepre  pOne solution I have thought of is to add light whenever the user releases the rotate button, but this is not very nice. I also do not know how to use the rotate callbacks when the button is in a separate figure.p  pDoes anyone know how to make the light track the 3D rotation, so that the current view is illuminatedp  pThanksp
Negative 794 pI am using SQlite and the PK column seems to be autoincrementing. I am a bit concerned about following approach where I want to normalize the codetypecodecolumnp  precodeTable Book id   type  name ...  ...   ... 15    1     Foo 16    2     Bar ...   ...  ...   Table Type id  typename 1   magazine 2   novel codepre  pWhat happens, if I recreate the codeTypecodetable and the PKindex id changes, e.g. that code1code now refers to codenovelcode instead of codemagazinecode. So to be more robust, I am thinking about inserting a custom second column that contains the logical indices that I refer top  precodeTable Book id   type  name 1    3     Foo 2    4     Bar  Table Type id   type  typename 1    3     magazine 2    4     novel codepre  pThis way my custom typeids would be independent from the primary keys. I think another advantage of the last approach is that I would not have to reask the latest new codeidcode of a new row, because I would refer to the codetypecode column that I know before. This way when I insert the row I already know the type id to make references I am using threads for the database, so reading a value from the database within a method is difficult or not possible   so if I would need the id, I would have to ask the db first.p  pIs this a legit approach Or should I directly create a nonincrementing primary key with my custom ids that I manage on my ownp

Negative 794 pI am trying to move data from a file into a hive table. The data in the file looks something like thisp  pStringA StringB StringC StringD StringEp  pwhere each string is separated by a space. The problem is that i want separate columns for StringA, StringB and StringC and one column for StringD onwards i.e. StringD and String E should be part of the same column. If i use  codeROW DELIMITED BY FIELDS TERMINATED BY  code, Hive would produce separate columns for StringD and StringE. StringD and StringE contain space within themselves whereas other strings do not contain spaces within themselvesp  pIs there any special syntax in hive to achieve this or do i need to preprocess my data file in some wayp

Negative 794 pIm having some difficulty with this question because I have a lot of background knowledge with regards to what needs to be done and my practical knowledge for how to implement it is spotty. I feel like I can almost answer my own question but there are random pieces of information missing which lead me to seek out help.p  h2What I want to doh2  pIm planning to start up a web application development business catered towards small businesses real estate, car sales, etc. From the outset I wish to use the best practices for developing and maintaining codep  ul liLocal development environmentli liRemote testing, staging, and production environments all separate machinesli liBest security practices bare minimum software running on the production and staging servers to minimize the risk of security holes, keep everything up to date, proper UNIX permissions configuration, etcli liAbility to utilize whatever tool is right for a given client MySQL vs MongoDB vs something else... or Apache vs nginx... or local storage vs S3li liFull version control on all codeli liAutoscaling to handle increased server load plus load balancingli liProper logging and analytics... on nearly everythingli ul  h2The scope of this questionh2  pI am not looking for best practices for any particular software item. I am not looking for help working with a particular API. Instead I want to know about the sysadmin process. In what order do you need to set things up or install things to be sure that everything works as intendedp  h2What needs to be doneh2  ol liSpinning up serversli ol  pFirst is the matter of spinning up servers.p  pI plan to use a third party server management solution like AmazonAWS or DigitalOcean. This way I have access to APIs for spinning up a server. However in order to utilize these APIs I must access them from strongsomewherestrong, so it seems logical to me that I should have one central control panel server which never gets spun down and houses no development code, then I log into here to monitor the health of my servers, spin up servers, and spin down servers. Is this accurate, or is there a better solutionp  pI also know that in order to manage testing, staging, and production servers for several clients and possibly multiple production servers if a client grows large enough I will need a configuration management tool like Chef or Salt. If I used such a tool, would my control center act as the master and all of the servers I spin up act as slaves Or should I have a second, separate server to act as my chef masterp  pFinally, when it comes to configuration management tools, how do I get them installed on the slaves Should I create a custom snapshot on AmazonAWS  DigitalOcean so that when I spin up a server its automatically installed, or will this run into issues if Chef is updated and my snapshot is not Should I SSH into a new server after spinning it up and install it manually using aptgetp  ol start2 liConfiguring the softwareli ol  pSo lets say I successfully spin up 3 servers testing, staging, and production. In staging and production I want install the latest Apache, MySQL, and PHP according to the best security and performance practices. Or maybe I want to install NGINX, MongoDB, and Node.js.p  pAs the software chosen may differ per client, I need some way to specify what will be installed. Its my understanding that this is trivially done through almost any configuration management tool. I also need a good way to add or update software in the future. Also should be trivial, however it would benefit me to have the actual process explained emHow do I upgrade MySQL on the production server without taking it down for an houremp  pThe real question now is how to properly configure it. Best practices for individual elements of software are beyond the scope of this question, as Im only interested in the process for being a sysadmin. I can look up the best way to install MySQL on my own time. However whats the best practice for doing it via configuration management Do I just update a single config file and every server is updated, or do I update staging then somehow perform a switch to production independent of Chefp  pThe whole switch from staging to production has always seemed like magic to me. How can you upgrade the software in production without at least a few seconds of downtimep  pAlso when it comes to the testing server, should automated testing tools be managed by Chef or should the testing server be managed manually like the local development environment might bep  ol start3 liSetting up version controlli ol  pI plan to use Git. Theres no debating this  I like it, and Ive used it in my job for two years now so Im familiar with it. However a major question remainsp  pHow do I get the code into testing  staging  productionp  pI need to have at the very least two repositories My local one for development and a remote one for tracking and collaboration. However in test I dont really need to clone the entire repository including all deltas. All I really need is the most uptodate files on the master branch.p  pIs it better to automate this process when something is pushed to the remote master it automatically shows up in test or should there be some way to push code into test so that a rogue developer cant screw up the test process by pushing new code in the middle of a test cycle Is this something that is managed by Chef, or something that I have to handle myselfp  ol start4 liSetting up the staging environmentli ol  pThis is really just a continuation of the question from 2. So I use Chef  Salt  Puppet  Whatever to ensure that staging and production have the same software installed, with the same versions, with the same configuration. Staging can clone the production database to be sure that theres no differences between the two environments. Then I somehow question 3 transfer my new code to staging to verify one last time that nothing breaks. Now Im ready to go to production...p  pHow do I do it How do I flip the switch to go from staging to production with absolutely zero downtime Using Chef doesnt seem ideal since it will have to copy over my new code meaning at least a few seconds downtime. Plus if there was an update to Apache  NGINX and I was testing out this update in staging, it could take the site down for several MINUTES while it installs the update.p  pSo how to do thisp

Now consider how often   it is true, that is how often does j  i  0. For each value of i, j ranges from 1 to i2, and j  i  0 only when j is a multiple of i. Therefore j  i    0 only when j  i, 2i, 3i, ..., i2. Thus the if statement is true i times for each value of i. Thus it is true On2 times. Thus the innermost loop is only reached On2 times. Every time it is reached it iterates j  On2 times. Therefore the total number of operations performed is On4.p blockquote

I saw many tutorials for example a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com51127nsurlsessiontutorial relnofollowthisa here. So far, I was not able to replace it. Because Im under time pressure, I cant waste more time to do this. Is here anyone who could help me to replace itp  pMy code looks exactly like thisp  precode voiddownloadItems       Download the json file     NSURL jsonFileUrl  [NSURL URLWithStringhttpmyhost.chtest.php]       Create the request     NSURLRequest urlRequest  [[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURLjsonFileUrl]       Create the NSURLConnection     [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequesturlRequest delegateself]    pragma mark NSURLConnectionDataProtocol Methods   voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didReceiveResponseNSURLResponse response       Initialize the data object     downloadedData  [[NSMutableData alloc] init]    voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection didReceiveDataNSData data       Append the newly downloaded data     [downloadedData appendDatadata]    voidconnectionDidFinishLoadingNSURLConnection connection       Create an array to store the locations     NSMutableArray locations  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]       Parse the JSON that came in     NSError error     NSArray jsonArray  [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithDatadownloadedData optionsNSJSONReadingAllowFragments erroramperror]       Loop through Json objects, create question objects and add them to our questions array     for int i  0 i lt jsonArray.count i              NSDictionary jsonElement  jsonArray[i]           Create a new location object and set its props to JsonElement properties         Location newLocation  [[Location alloc] init]         newLocation.idS  jsonElement[idStatistic]         newLocation.temp  jsonElement[temp]         newLocation.hum  jsonElement[hum]         newLocation.datetime  jsonElement[datetime]           Add this question to the locations array         [locations addObjectnewLocation]            Ready to notify delegate that data is ready and pass back items     if self.delegate              [self.delegate itemsDownloadedlocations]       codepre

Negative 794 pMy website contains a section for users to upload photo albums with up to 1000 photos. Currently, my PHP upload script keeps crashing despite my removing filesize and upload limits from the PHP.ini I have just about removed all restrictions against file uploading. How would you suggest going about uploading this many files I am currently just passing the FILES array then using the moveuploadedfile function. Would FTP allow me to upload smoother without interruptions, or should I use a new language all together These are the errors that I am receiving The connection was resetp  pThe connection to the server was reset while the page was loading. The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments. If you are unable to load any pages, check your computers network connection. If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.p  pandp  pRequest Entity Too Large The requested resource index.htmluploadAnAlbum.php does not allow request data with GET requests, or the amount of data provided in the request exceeds the capacity limit.
