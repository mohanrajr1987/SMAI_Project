Positive 28135 pI created this topic as I could not find the answer even though there are many similar threads.p  pRecently many users reported that the tool created in Visual Studio stopped working. This is a WPF application written in C and its purpose is to pick up Excel spreadsheets and export them to Oracle database for further calculations. p  pThe application crashes when it attempts to create a class codeOracleBulkCopycode which is a member of codeOracle.DataAccesscode library it is added to the project as Reference. The project was distributed among users as installation package and the idea was that they do not need to install anything else. p  pCurrently I am investigating this issue on 3 machinesp  ul li1  my regular laptopli li2  virtual machine set up on my laptopli li3  old laptop delivered by my colleagueli ul  pIt works well only on machine no 3 which has reinstalled Windows 7 64bit and Oracle Client 11g Oracle.DataAccess version 2.112.2.0. The other two also run on Windows 7 64bit, we performed tests on various Oracle libraries. Machine number 1 is a bit messy as I removed or reinstalled many versions of DataAccess and in GAC they are all visible. I tried to setup machine no 2 virtual machine, also fresh Windows 7 the same way as machine no 3 but the application still crashes.p  pHere is the error message and my findings after browsing some forums and StackOverflow questions.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comUarxh.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUarxh.jpg altltphoto1gtap  ol liI found some information about codeInnerExceptioncode which I caught with try...catch.

Negative 28135 pI have a set of staticallycompiled libraries, with fairly deeprunning dependencies between the libraries.

Also, when new dependencies are added anywhere in the dependency tree, the project file of any program that uses A or B would have to be reconfigured.

Negative 28135 pIm starting to build a commercial application that uses an opensource library. Ive been poring over various documents and postings, but Im still having trouble. From what I understand I need to isolate the open source part. One way to do this is to provide a class which communicates with the open source through vanilla links. p  pThe proposed solution is to modify the opensource a command line utility to give it some kind of API. Then develop an wrapper or proxy program that uses the API to communicate with the opensource program. Release the modified source and the wrapper as open source, but keep the rest of the source closed. Note that the opensource piece would be delivered with the code and executed either as a statically or dynamically linked library. p  pDoes this work under GPL p

Negative 28135 pI have a form with some select elements. One of them is configured so that if the user changes the value, the next input may get enabled or disabled, depending on the value. When changing the value with the mouse, everything works fine. However, when using the keyboard, strange things happen. It acts differently from one browser to another.p  pIn Firefox, if I change the value to enable the next input, then press the tab key, the focus skips the input that was just enabled. I can focus it by pressing shifttab, but I think that may be annoying and confusing to users.p  pIn Chrome, if I change the value to enable the next input, then press tab, the focus jumps like in Firefox. If I change the value to disable the next input, then press tab, the next input gets focused despite being disabled. This is strange, but not a big deal because the user can press tab again and focus the input after it.p  pIn Internet Explorer, something very strange happens everything works fine If I change the value to enable the next input, then press tab, the next input gets focused. If I change the value to disable the next input, then press tab, the focus skips the disabled input. It works in IE 6, 7, and 8.p  pI am doing the enabling and disabling with jQuery.

Negative 28135 pOne if the first things I learned when I started with C was the most important one. You can decompile any .NET assembly with Reflector or other tools. Many developers are not aware of this fact and most of them are shocked when I show them their source code.p  pProtection against decompilation is still a difficult task. I am still looking for a fast, easy and secure way to do it. I dont want to obfuscate my code so my method names will be a,b,c or so. Reflector or other tools should be unable to recognize my application as .NET assembly at all. I know about some tools already but they are very expensive. Is there any other way to protect my applicationsp  pEDITp  pThe reason for my question is not to prevent piracy. I only want to stop competitors from reading my code. I know they will and they already did. They even told me so. Maybe I am a bit paranoid but business rivals reading my code doesnt make me feel good. p

We have a unit of work we call Ideal Developer Session IDS, maybe 2 or 3 hours of working together as a pair. Its not perfectly well defined because we know estimation always is inaccurate but from our past shared experience we have a common sense of what an IDS is. If we cant estimate a task because it feels too long for a week we break it down into estimatable smaller tasks. liDuring a short meeting on Wednesday we commit to a workload we feel is well doable in a week. We commit to complete. liIf a team runs out of committed tasks during the week, it can pick new ones from the prioritized queue we have in Jira. li ul  pWhen we started working this way, some of us found that remote pair programming takes a lot of energy because you are so focussed.

Negative 28135 pLets say I have the following table in SQL Server 2008p  precodeProfileID   int          identity index unique, primary key, clustered ClientID    int RegionID    int ProfileName nvarchar50 codepre  pColumns 2 and 3 link to their respective tables via foreign relationships.p  pLets say my most common query is thisp  precodeSELECT ProfileID, ProfileName FROM   Profiles WHERE  ClientID   AND RegionID   ORDER  BY ProfileName codepre  pWhat indexing system is best suitedp  pIf I put a covering index on ProfileID, ProfileName, then that kills the default clustered index since covering indexes have to be nonclustered, but satisfies at least the return part of the query.p  pIf I leave the primary key asis, and independently index ClientID and RegionID, that gives me 3 indexes that have to be maintained by the RDBMS, PLUS a table scan would still be needed to return ProfileName as it isnt covered. This seems heavy.p  pA simple casestudy of how intricate indexing planning can be.p

For example, if there is a column of CHAR14, no of extra spaces in the end are 28.p  pThis is happening in the System Testing environment only. In our local desktops, using the same ojdbc14.jar and same code, we did not get any extra spaces.p  pI think the only thing different in System Testing environment is database. Is it related to some character encoding Do we have some configuration in database to change itp

I dont want to query the db and copy all the properties to the object that is returned from query. In other words, EF should have update method which takes in the entity similar to Add method. If the entitykey already exists in the database, update the entity with the current values. i.e. why should we do Attach and then copy all the properties to the attached object. To me it seems redundant to copy all the properties of entities just to update when the disconnected object already exist.p
Negative 28135 pMy knowledge of Javascript is rudimentary at best Im not a coder by trade, but Im trying to cobble a page together such that there are two divs sitting on top of a jQuery image carousel. a hrefhttpjtroll.comchdwebindex.html relnofollowThis pagea is the example of what Im talking about, with this screen grab showing how it should look in proper fighting form jtroll.comchdwebproperform.png as a firsttime poster, stackoverflow wont let me attach more than one proper link. Sorry.p  pMy first problem was trying to figure out how to do some sort of positioning trickery so that I could throw both the div codectaimgboxlearnmorecode and codeimgboxoutcode on top of the jQuery carousel, codeslideblockcode. I made a silly additional wrapper div, called codebox1homecode, thinking this would help in that effort because when I tried to put those divs inside of codeslideblockcode, it screwed up the image cycle in the carousel.p  pI did some codepositionrelativecode tomfoolery, only to realize it was pushing the entire codeslideblockcode down the page according to the height of codectaimgboxlearnmorecode. Bad news. So of course, I thought giving codeslideblockcode a negative top margin might be a decent way to hack around this.p  pOnce I added the second div codeimgboxoutcode though, it all went to hell. The text Im trying to flow into that div is being pushed to the side, and I had to add even more ridiculous negative margin to the top of codeslideblockcode. Not cool.p  pSo I guess my question is whats a better, cleaner, smarter way to do this, that wont screw up the jQuery carouselp

Negative 28135 pI have a web app built with codeigniter that runs every n amount of time. It will execute a stored procedure that gets a list of recent orders. Part of the task is to use the stored procedure but Im sure if a solution requires another method that shouldnt be a problem.p  pThe records retrieved will each have a unique order id. When the records are pulled out the order data is taken, put together as a pdf, and sent in an email to the order owner.p  pMy question is which is the best way to go about only retrieving records that havent been processed before. My initial thought was to store the last record processed in a file. Each time the applcation is run, look up the file, get the last stored ID, and then pull out records with an id  that that. p  pA while back I wrote a Perl script that did something similar with a log file using the Tail module. It would look up and file and see a new line it hadnt processed then process it, but then again that scipt was constatly running. I know its quite different but is there anything similar I can do in PHP with a dbp  pId prefer not to have to store anything in a DB, only querying via a stored procedure.p  pThanks,p  pBillyp

So the codeUsercode holds the account info, the codeOtherModelcode could be a purchasable item, and codePOJOWithCompositecode is a shopping cart that holds items and quantities, say. My analogy breaks down a little when it comes to the main object, but humour me, and lets say for every session we add the shopping cart the user paid for to the list, which will then be archived, say.p  pFirstly, if the list belongs to each user I could just add it to the codeUsercode model, although I feel that this isnt very modular i.e. the information isnt really user account information. ATM, this map sits in a utilitylike shopping class, which takes care of matching shopping carts with shoppers, to save me from making the codeUsercode model too big. Is there a better pattern to use here perhapsp  pAssuming that I continue down this road, Lets try and map this codeMapcode. Ideally, I would like to be able to map it as is. Although I have had very little luck with that.p  pI happened upon some talk of mapping codeArrayListcode easily because its codeSerializablecode, although didnt manage to implement that here.p  pSo I made a wrapper entityp  precodeEntity public class POJOWithCompositeList extends Model     OneToMany    ListltPOJOWithCompositegt list  new ArrayListltPOJOWithCompositegt  codepre  pThis works.

Negative 28135 pIm using the HTML5 File API to assemble multipart form data for submission by XHR to a web service.

Negative 28135 pI am in my first programming class and I am now reaching the end of the semester.  I have an online portfolio where I share my college accomplishments.  At this point in the semester, I would like to upload some of the simple Applets I have created to my online portfolio.  My portfolio is hosted on Weebly.com.  I tried uploading the files to the host site and using the simple  tags to run the applet within the html.  Im quite sure Im accessing the files using the correct directories.  But before we jump to any conclusions there, I decided I ought to run the applets locally to ensure Im doing everything correctly.  I am on a macbook pro running OS 10.6.6. In Java Preferences, my Java SE versions are Java SE 6 64bit and Java SE 6 32bit.  My plugin version is 1.6.0 found in SystemLibraryJavaJavaVirtualMachines.  These are the only versions I have on my machine.  My research tells me that I may be having version disagreements.  Some forums have suggested going back to plugin version 1.5 although, I have no idea how. Im pretty sure now though that apple has updated Safari to a 64bit version.  I have Eclipse set to 1.6 also.

Negative 28135 pBackground  Normally with basic UIViewControllers Im across how you can create instance variables marked as IBOutlets, and link these to the actual view controls with Interface Builder.  p  pQuestion  If I pass a model object to a UIViewController, is there a way to link the View controls e.g. UILabel, UIPickerView etc directly to the model variables i.e. effectively instance variables in a custom class   p  pThat is this way as soon as the user changes the UI control it would instantly update the model attributes.  Assuming youve passed the model to the controller as passbyreference, therefore youve automatically updated the values for the parent as a result.p  pIm thinking this would avoid having to a at initialisation translate the model values to set the UI components, and b when finishing up with the view having to manually update the model variables from the UI components.p

So is this the correct way to do it Please dont respond that it is OK if you havent read the code carefully, when it comes to shared pointers its easy to make mistakes when doing abuses like thistrust me.

Negative 28135 pThings have changed way too much in the bussines logic for our Flex 3 customer extranet application, so I have received the permision to make a fresh start... with low date pressure I know, you envy me.... Instead choosing the obvious Flex 4 path, it seems that PerlCatalyst fits very, very well in this brand new scenary, but I dont want to lose some goodiesp  pWe have just ONE set of .swf modules, so all clients load the same actual files in a shared path.p  ul liThey are Virtual Hosts.li liEach domain directory has a index.php. It loads a personalization file with passwords AND the real shared index.php that loads the shared .swf.li liNo crossdomain problems because the .swf thinks that its in the true domain, thanks to the Apache virtual link.li liAll personalization inside the .swf bussines data and visual prefs are loaded dinamically from preferences in a databaseli ul  pIt seems that I can do the same with Catalyst, isnt it Even easier, because I can make the perl app to respond globally to the same arguments in different vhosts, so everything can be decide at runtimep  hr  pBut the great advantage of Flex is that I have all the logic and preferences already loaded in the client, so the work in the server and the data transference is really, really low.

Negative 28135 pIm working on an application that encrypts configuration file settings for an ASP.Net web server. The encryption method Im implementing is enveloping data using AES and RSA. Im generating an AES Key, using that AES key to encrypt my data, then encrypting the AES key with the public key from a certificate in my Windows Certificate Store. I then save the data, along with the encrypted AES key, and the certificate serial number used to encrypt it, back to the configuration file. When I want to access this data, I read the serial number of the certificate used to encrypt the AES key, pull out the private key from that certificate, and decrypt the AES key, then decrypt the data using that key. Here is where I am unsure of my level of security. p  pIn order to access the private key associated with the certificate, I must mark the private key as exportable, and give the user my application runs under access to the private key. Since this is an ASP.Net server, that user is Network Services. Im sure you can see why this would be a security issue. Basically if anyone were to break into my ASP.Net server over the web, perhaps through some sort of injection, they would have access to that private key, would they not p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how I could make my model more secure p  pDecrypt Functionp  precode     need an rsa crytpo provider to decrypt the aes key with the private key associated with the certificate         using RSACryptoServiceProvider rsaCSP  RSACryptoServiceProvider decryptionCertificate.PrivateKey                      decrypt the aes key with the certs private key             byte[] aesKey  rsaCSP.DecryptencryptedAESKey, false              decrypt data using the decrypted aes key and the IV passed in             decryptedData  decryptWithAesencryptedData, aesKey, aesIV          codepre  pThanks.p

Negative 28135 pI have a fairly simple system, and for the purposes of this question there are essentially three parts  Models, Repositories, Application Code.p  pAt the core are the models.  Lets use a simple contrived examplep  precodepublic class Person      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set   codepre  pIn that same project is a generic repository interface.  At its simplestp  precodepublic interface IRepositoryltTgt      T SaveT model  codepre  pImplementations of that interface are in a separate project and injected with StructureMap.  For simplicityp  precodepublic class PersonRepository  IRepositoryltPersongt      public Person SavePerson model              throw new NotImplementedExceptionI got to the save method          In the repository methods I would interact with the database, or          potentially with some other service for data persistence.  For          now Im just using LINQ to SQL to a single database, but in the          future there will be more databases, external services, etc. all          abstracted behind here.       codepre  pSo, in application code, if I wanted to save a model I would do thisp  precodevar rep  IoCFactory.Current.Container.GetInstanceltIRepositoryltPersongtgt myPerson  rep.SavemyPerson codepre  pSimple enough, but it feels like it could be automated a lot.  That pattern holds throughout the application code, so what Im looking to do is create a single generic codeSavecode on all models which would just be a shorthand call to the above application code.  That way one would need only callp  precodemyPerson.Save codepre  pBut I cant seem to figure out a way to do it.  Maybe its deceptively simple and Im just not looking at it from the correct angle.  At first I tried creating an empty codeISaveableModelltTgtcode interface and intended to have each saveable model implement it, then for the single generic codeSavecode method I would have an extension on the interfacep  precodepublic static void SaveltTgtthis ISaveableModelltTgt model      var rep  IoCFactory.Current.Container.GetInstanceltIRepositoryltTgtgt     model  rep.Savemodel  codepre  pBut it tells me that coderep.Savemodelcode has invalid arguments.  It seems that its not wiring up the type inference as Id hoped it would.  I tried a similar approach with a codeBaseModelltTgtcode class from which models would inheritp  precodepublic class BaseModelltTgt      public void Save              this  IoCFactory.Current.Container.GetInstanceltIRepositoryltTgtgt.Savethis       codepre  pBut the compiler error is the same.  Is there a way to achieve what Im trying to achieve  Im very flexible on the design, so if Im going about something all wrong on an architectural level then I have room to step back and change the big picture.p

Negative 28135 pI have some question about how GPUs perform synchronizations. As I know, when a warp encounters a barrier assuming it is in OpenCL, and it knows that the other warps of the same group havent been there yet. So it has to wait. But what exactly does that warp do during the waiting time  Is it still an active warp Or will it do some kind of null operations p  pAs I notice, when we have a synchronization in the kernel, the number of instructions increases. I wonder what is the source of this increment. Is the synchronization broken down into that many smaller GPU instructions Or because the idle warps perform some extra instructionsp  pAnd finally, I strongly wonder if the cost added by a synchronization, compared to one without synch, lets say barrierCLKLOCALMEMFENCE is affected by the number of warp in a workgroup or threadblock Thanksp

I will start by describing our current setting and problems.p  pWe have a system that needs to resize and crop a large amount of images from big original images. We handle 50 000 images every day on 2 powerfull servers. Today we use ImageGlue from WebSupergoo but we dont like it at all, it is slow and hangs the service now and then Its in another unanswered stack overflow question. We have a threaded windows service that uses Microsoft ThreadPool to resize as much as possible on the 8 core machines. p  pI have tried AForge and it went very well it was loads faster and never crashed or anything. But I had problems with quality on a few images. This due to what algorithms I used ofc so can be tweaked. But want to widen our eyes to see if thats the right way to go.p  psop  ul liIt needs to be c .net and run in a windows service. Since we wont change the rest of the service only image handlingli liIt needs to handle threaded environment well.li liWe have a great need of it being fast since today its too slow.

Negative 28135 pI am extremely new to PHP and, although I am quite familiar to javascript, I am learning how to use the massive jqGrid plugin right now.

The problem comes in when I add the serializegriddata.  p  pI am looking for any examples of how to use the postData on the client side are the any other functions I need to add to the serializegriddata or can I just return the postData and how to properly parse this in PHP how to POST the data and then how to parse and use this data.  I know this is probably an extremely simple solution, but everything I find just talks about the client and says nothing about the server side.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 28135 pThe stream table contains a comments array  a sampling of the comments, which in turn, has a canremove field. This field is either true or false depending on whether the currently loggedin user can remove comments for that particular stream post, according to the docs a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencefqlstream relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencefqlstreamap  pThe problem is that the canremove field applies to ALL the comments. This is not the correct behavior. Certain comments within the commentlist may be removable by the user while others may not be removable.p  pFor example, if I comment on my friends post, I should be able to remove my comment. However, I should not be able to remove other peoples comments on that post. I dont understand how the value of the canremove field is determined in a case like this. It certainly cannot be applied to every comment because I should not be allowed to remove every comment, yet there is only one canremove field per comments object per stream post. p  pThe correct behavior would be for every comment within the commentlist to have its own canremove field.p

Negative 28135 pI plan on having a SQL fact table involving a text field which I dont expect to index on I will only read out the data and very rarely update it.  I think this table could get quite large, primarily due to this text field.  The rest of the data in my database does make sense to be relational, however I believe I could scale much more easily and cheaply if I instead store pointers to flat files where each pointer is to a different text file stored in something like S3 instead of using the text field.p  pAn alternative that seems to be gaining popularity is a fully NoSQL documentbased solution e.g. CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.  I am wondering what are the tradeoffs scalabilityreliabilitysecurityperformanceease of implementationease of maintenancecost between simply using a SQL text field, having a pointer to flat files, or completely rethinking the entire system in the context of a NoSQL document storep

The first table can be purchases from record company to distributers which each have their own owner ids and multiple accounts for each end user user id. So within their first purchase of an mp3, they have a 30 days subscription service to download unlimited mp3s. The second last table is their billing schedule. So its unfair to charge a full days worth of mp3s if they buy a song 1 day before the billing period ends so it has to be split up into pieces, and the balance charged the following month.p

Negative 28135 pIm interested in representing a sequence of symbols from a finite set in the least number of bytes.p  pFor example, say you had a text string which only contained the characters az. You could encode them as ascii, so 1 byte per symbol character. However, by doing that youre only using 26 of the possible 256 values per byte.p  pIve coded a solution which seems to work well, but Id like to know if anyone knows or can think of a better way.p  pMy method is to treat the sequence as an integer in base n, where n is codethe size of the set of symbols  1code. For example, if your set or symbols, or alphabet was codea, b, ccode length 3 then wed use base 4. The symbols are assigned numerical values so codea gt 1, b gt 2, c gt 3code. Therefore, the sequence code[b, a, c]code is treated as the number 213 in base 4, so 39 in decimal. This integer can be encoded in binary, and decoded back to its base 4 representation to retrieve the sequence code2, 1, 3 gt [b, a, c]code.p  pMy Python implementation of the above a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orghalradixcodecsrc88e87e2397desrcradixcodec.py relnofollowradixcodec.pyap  pSo my question is, is there a more space efficient method of encoding lists of elements from a finite set than the one Ive describedp

The basics are that it take in some variables defined by the GUI, based upon entries by the user. Then, it compiles these into a batch file for the command line tool to interpret. Just getting the GUI to run the command line once you hit the patch button was fairly interesting, but I was unable to read in any errors that may have arisen during the execution, due in no small part to the fact that I was using start in the arguments for runtimeVar.exec. I was able to get a resident Java guy to help me out, but it switched from forking the process to another thread to running the process in the same thread, blocking the GUI from responding to anything else.

Negative 28135 pHi I am having an issue with deciding how to storecalculate a value. The value is this case is dynamically generated by executing a javascript function that is stored in a mysql database. p  pThe company I work for originally did this because other values that are used by the stored javascript function can be changed and because this is done by a AJAX request, the value needs to be calculated on the clients side. Somehow this doesnt feel right, and I think there has to be a better way to store this.p  pNow I am not sure how I should solve this, but I hope some of you can point me in the right direction.p  pI hope I explained the problem clear enough.p  pEDIT An example. There is a value x that needs to be calculated and currently this happens. p  precodefunction example     ify  true        return 0          var result  z  areaM2     ifresult gt 100         return 1          else         return 2       x  example codepre  py, z and areaM2 are actual stored variables.p

Negative 28135 pI set up my Rails application twice. One is working with MongoDB Mongoid as mapper and the other with MySQL and ActiveRecord. Then I wrote a rake task which inserts some testdata to both databases 100.000 entries.  I measured how long it takes for each database with the ruby Benchmark module. I did some testing with 100 and 10.000 entries where mongodb was always faster than mysql about 13. The weird thing is that it takes about 3 times longer in mongodb to insert the 100.000 entries than with mysql. I have no idea why mongodb has this behaviour The only thing that I know is that the cpu time is much lower than the total time. Is it possible that mongodb starts some sort of garbage collection while its inserting the data At the beginning its fast, but as more data mongodb is inserting, it gets slower and slower...any idea on this p  pTo get somehow a read performance of the two databases, I thought about measuring the time when the database gets an search query and respond the result. As I need some precise measurements, I dont want to include the time where Rails is processing my query from the controller to the database.p  pHow do I do the measurement directly at the database and not in the Rails controller Is there any gem  tool which would help mep  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT Updated my question according to my current situationp

Negative 28135 pI have been working on a web project that stores locations for users. The project uses currently MySql 5.5 and JPA 2 for mapping the relation database, together with EJB 3.1 as the middle tier. I store longitude and latitude data in Decimal data types in MySql. p  pI want to expand the project so the user can search for Points GPS coordinates near the location heshe marks out through using Google Map API 3 on the map.p  pI need some hints and suggestions before starting transforming or changing components in my project. If possible with tutorial and how to achieve the changes and what tools library, dev tools, etc. to use. Here are my questions.p  ol liCan I use the Spatial extension in MySql using data types like Point and map this to entities that are supported by JPA 2 like DataNucleus library, if they are supported by JPA 2. That are light weight and can persist them self through the persistent layer.li liIs it better to move to PostGIS and Postgres which seem to have better spatial support with all the pain and effort needed to change database and using hibernate instead. Netbeans has Hibernate support but when trying with the JDBC for PostGis I stumble upon problems. Need a good tutorial to follow to get started if I go down this road.li liUsing the infrastructure that is already inplace and compute the distance from lactation A and B.

For example, some regulatory data and business logic will only have to be used in one country or the other.p  pSince a company can contain only one type of employee in this app that is the employees of a company can only be Canadian or American, I was thinking of just using mixins to add the different functionality at runtime, instead of creating an inheritance hierarchy which has the potential to become extremely cumbersome. The Employee class will not be the only class which has differences between countries, so it seems it would be helpful to dynamically augment all my classes to include regional functionality at runtime. p  pIs this is an effective way to organize my app, or are there some downsides to this p

Negative 28135 pIm using woothemes flexslider on this websitep  pLINK REMOVED had to remove the linkp  pThe sliders are working fine in all browsers. Only Safari seems to have some issues with them. Actually Safari creates the sliders correctly and they work per se, but oftentimes the contents of the sliders are not visible. When you look in the sourcecode or inspect the slides you will see, that all of the sliderelements are there and nothing looks wrong. Anyways the contents dont show. Sometimes, if you wait a while they suddenly show up but sometimes also later disappear again. Also when you interact with the slider some of the slides either also dont display or are kind of halfrendered you see just a part of the content as if it was cut off somewhere in the middle and sometimes they show properly.  All this only happens in Safari I have currently installed Safari 5.1.7.p  pI allready noticed that it could have something to do with the css of the ul.slides holding the slides. When you slide through the Contents flexslider assignsp  precodewebkittransform translate3d[somevalue]px, 0px, 0px codepre  pto the p  precodeltul classslidesgt codepre  pWhen you disable this style in the safari devtools, the contents instantly show up but of course the flexslider as a result wont work properly anymore.p  pThanks for any help.p  pEDITp  pSeems like Safari has some issues with translate3d. Flexslider uses this. I exchanged translate3d for translate in the script. Now it works fine, but the content of the slides dissapear for a short moment while sliding. Seems like, there are some issues with translate3d and translate in combination with overlapping elements with a zindex assigned to them google translate3d bug safari, you will find some similar issues.p  pAny further hints are welcome, thx.p

Negative 28135 h2The systemh2  pI have written a simple message distribution system based on PHP and Apache for a business client. A simplified version of the data flow looks like this A JSON message is sent over HTTP to a a PHP script running on a Apache server which does some processing on it and in turn distributes it, again using HTTP, to a number of clients, approx. 1020. These messages occur at different intervals at up to 5 messages per second, but sometimes as infrequent as one per minute.p  pThe server used is a beefy Ubuntu machine with 8gB memory and a fast network card located in a wellconnected data warehouse.p  pSince the client has very strict requirements regarding the response time for messages expecting a reply, the response time has to be below 200ms, I have implemented my own HttpRequest class to allow for very fine grained control over various timeouts and execution duration. The server uses this class to forward messages to its clients. The interesting part looks something like thisp  precodeclass HttpRequest      private host     private port     private path      private connection  null     private headers  array      [...]      const CONTENTTYPE  applicationjson     const ENCODING  utf8     const TIMEOUT  0.2      const MAXRESPONSESIZE  0xFFFF  64 kB      public function constructurl, callback  null          if emptyurl              throw new HttpExceptionurl cannot be empty                   urlparts  parseurlurl          thisgthost  urlparts[host]         thisgtport  emptyurlparts[port]  80  urlparts[port]         thisgtpath  urlparts[path]          thisgtheaders[Host]  thisgthost         thisgtheaders[Connection]  close         thisgtheaders[CacheControl]  nocache           public function destruct          try              thisgtdisconnect          catch Exception e                     private function connect          if thisgtconnection  null               already connected, simply return             return                   errno           errstr           timeout  selfTIMEOUT          thisgtconnection  fsockopenthisgthost, thisgtport, errno, errstr, timeout          if thisgtconnection  false              throw new HttpExceptionerror during connect errstr, errno  SOCKETETIMEDOUT                   streamsettimeoutthisgtconnection, intfloortimeout, inttimeout  floortimeout  1000000          [variable assignments]           private function disconnect          if thisgtconnection  null               already disconnected, simply return             return                   fclosethisgtconnection         thisgtconnection  null           public function postdata, fetchresponse  true, path  null          if emptydata              throw new HttpExceptionno data given, false                   contenttype  applicationxwwwformurlencoded          if isstringdata              data  urlencodedata          else if isarraydata              data  httpbuildquerydata          else if data instanceof Message              data  jsonencodedata              contenttype  applicationjson                   if isstringdata              throw new HttpExceptionwrong datatype, false                   encoding  mbdetectencodingdata          if encoding  selfENCODING              data  mbconvertencodingdata, selfENCODING, encoding                   if emptypath              path  thisgtpath                    set header values         thisgtheaders[ContentType]  contenttype .  charset . selfENCODING         thisgtheaders[ContentLength]  mbstrlendata           build request         request  POST path HTTP1.1rn          foreach thisgtheaders as header gt value              request . header valuern                   request . rndata           and send it         thisgtsendRequestrequest, fetchresponse          if fetchresponse               fetch and parse response             resp  thisgtreceiveResponse              return resp                    public function getpath  null          [build and execute http query]           private function sendRequestrequest, keepconnected  true           connect the socket         thisgtconnect          [timer1]           write out data         result  fwritethisgtconnection, request          [timer2]          if result  false  result  mbstrlenrequest              thisgtdisconnect             throw new HttpExceptionwrite to socket failed, false                   if keepconnected              thisgtdisconnect                    private function receiveResponse          [fetch response using streamselect and fgets while strictly observing the timeout]           private function parseLinemsg          [process http response, used in receiveResponse]       codepre  pThis class is usually used like thisp  precoderequest  new HttpRequesturl requestgtpostdata codepre  h2The problemh2  pEvery once in a while some messages expire with timeouts of over five seconds being recorded. Just from the code this should be impossible, since every call to IOrelated functions should time out long before this amount of time.p  pProfiling statements indicated in the code as [timer1] and [timer2] have revealed that the call to HttpRequestconnect is where this delay is happening. My best guess would be that fsockopen for some reason ignores the timeout handed to it.p  pInterestingly, whenever there are timeouts that exceed the given limit, they are usually just over 5 seconds, leading me to believe that there is a 5 second delay somewhere in the lower layers of network code eg. exhaustion of socket resources. DNSrelated issues can probably be ruled out, since this behavior also occurs when the host is specified using IP addresses.p  pThe problem usually occurs when a message is to be distributed to many clients, meaning many requests will be sent in rapid succession, but I have also noticed it when sending a single message to only one client. It appears to generally, but not neccessarily, occur when there are multiple simultaneous requests to Apache.p  pHas anyone experienced a similar problem The interwebs have not been very exhaustive, neither has working through the PHP source code. Any pointers on how to approach this issuep
Negative 28135 pSo I have a chart that looks something like this. Assume that the top left value, 1, is in cell A1p  precodex    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8        4    3    2    1    2    3    4    5        9    8    7    6    7    8    9    10        8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1  Sum 21   18   15   12   13   14   15    16 codepre  pThere are x values from 1 to 8, and a three columns of values resulting from using it an equation or something below it. The sum is the sum of the three values below their corresponding xvalue.p  pIm stuck trying to figure something out that will go through the row of sums, find the smallest value, and then assign its corresponding xvalue to a variable. I also need to assign the values to the left and right of that xvalue to other variables.p  pFor this particular chart, 12 is the smallest of the sums, so I would assign codevariable1  4code, since that is that columns corresponding xvalue. Then my second variable, which is called codelowerboundcode, would equal 3, since it is to the left of x  4, and my third variable, which is called codeupperboundcode, would equal 5, since it is to the right of x  4.p  pIf I could get the cell address returned of the xvalue that corresponds to the smallest sum, then I could assign it to a variable, and then simply offset from that cell to assign the other variables. Even if I could make a program that will return me the cell of the minimum sum value, I could offset to the xrow, and go from there.p  pHow would I do something like thatp  pstrongTLDR To ask more clearly, since thats a lot of words What would a program look like that detects the smallest value in the sum row, and returns the cell address of that valuestrongp  pThe length of the rows are an unknown, and vary a lot, but the length of the columns are given. They do change depending on the problem, but they will always be known. So I will always know how many rows are in a column, but I will not know how many columns are in a row.p  pThis is the most confusinglyworded thing Ive ever written in my entire life, but I hope Ive explained it well enough to make some sense.p  pYou guys really are amazing, by the way. Ive gotten so far on this program, and its all because of how helpful you are. I honestly think I would still be stuck at the beginning with you guys Youre willing to tolerate a newbies incessant questions.p

Negative 28135 pIm pretty new to iOS development, and I want to figure out if theres a good way to handle this issue. Basically, Im making a technical calculator that returns some product specifications based on user input parameters. The product in question has specs for some, embut not allem user parameters, so I . In a constants file, I have a bunch of ATTENSPECX variables which are codeconst doublecode or codeconst NSString code. Now, its perfectly okay to be missing a spec, so my plan was to leverage NSArrays ability to hold different types and use introspection later to handle strings vs doubles before I report the returned specs. p  pHeres an incomplete example of one method Im implementing. Its just a big conditional tree that should return a twoelement array of the final values of codespeccode and codenominalcode.p  precode NSArray attenuatorSwitchingdouble attenuator double spec, nominal ...     else if attenuator0         specATTENSPEC3     this atten spec is a string         nominalATTENNOM3      ... return array of spec, nominal not actual objc code codepre  pSo instead of making spec and nominal doubles, can I make them some other general type The really important thing here is that I dont want to use any special handling within this method stronganother coder should be able to go back to the constants file, change ATTENNOM3 to a double, and not have to retool this method at all.strong p  pThanks.p

Negative 28135 pI got .net 4.0 with Entity Framework 4.0 with Visual Studio 2012 and Windows 7, 64bit architecture, 4 cores. p  pIm performing some tests on a console application with the AdventureWorks database. The thing that is bothering me is that the first time I take some products it takes much more time than the second time, I want to know why. p  pI know that there are some tasks that Entity Framework perform during its first query, so I executed some extra query ahead. p  pFor example, my main function contains the following  p  precodeusing var context  new Context     execute context.Clients.ToList    lt this takes something like 300 ms   using var context  new Context     execute context.Products.ToList    lt this takes something like 200 ms   using var context  new Context     execute context.Products.ToList    lt this takes something like 10 ms  codepre  pSo you see that the first query with all the first time execution things is taking 300 ms. p  pThe second takes 200s, and the third one, which is the same like the second takes only 10ms. p  pSo my question is  why is my third query taking such a small amount of time  I do not use autocompile since there is no such in EF 4.0, or the CompiledQuery class. p  pAlso my first invocation to Products is not the first query on the model, so all the work for view generation should be already done. p  pBut still it takes so much time the first time and is so fast the second time I call Products. Does it cache something somewhere p  pAnother thing I noticed is that when I compile it for 64 bit, it takes a ridiculous amount of time, something like one second. And when I compile it for 32 bit, it takes the amount I had given. p  pCan you give me some hints here  p  pThanks p

Negative 28135 pA BAT file I created on my XP Pro SP3 system works perfectly every time.br Installed on another XP [also Pro SP3] system it fails hangs up every time.p  pThe problem turns out to be in a multistep pipe. To isolate it I kept simplifying until I arrived at this minimal [and artificial] test casepre code    echo.  date  find   find   find codeprep  pNote the first two steps are not shortened to codedate tcode because some of the users systems are preXP [and thus lack Command Extensions].  Also careful testing shows that codedatecode is executing the MSDOS internal codeDATEcode command and codefindcode is executing the vanilla FIND.EXE, Aug  4 2004, 9216 found in   CWINDOWSsystem32 [and identical to the safety copy in Ci386].p  pOn the failing system, every command with 4 or more s hangs in the fifth step, even when  as here  the programs are simple and the amount of text they are handling is minuscule.p  pblockquoteI did some further testing on the users system yesterday and discovered a subtlety of which I was unaware.  I entered the simplified command [above] at the command prompt.  It failed [hung] as expected.  However, when I rebooted and tried again before doing anything else [a case which would never occur in the users normal operation], I got a shock  it worked [i.e., the output of the MSDOS DATE command appeared as expected].  It worked again.  Then on the third try the failure mode reappeared, and remained consistent thereafter.  blockquoteblockquoteI confirmed that codefiles40code is in effect on both systems, and gave up.  Im still curious but I cant spend a lot of time on a small project for a strongempro bonoemstrong client analyzing a problem for which I have easy workarounds.blockquotep  blockquoteThank you everyone here for your quick and useful responses.blockquote  pOn the original system, commands with 4 or more s work properly regardless of which programs are invoked and how much text [within reason] they are handling.p  pOnce the limitation is recognized there are many trivial workarounds, so my question is solely one of curiosity  can anyone suggest where the limit comes from and whether there is a setting [in XP] that will raiseeliminate itp  pNote  Neither HKEYLOCALMACHINESoftwareMicrosoftCommand ProcessorAutoRun nor HKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareMicrosoftCommand ProcessorAutoRun exists on either system.p  pAlso  I apologize for answering comments by repeatedly editing my original post but no matter which browser I use to log in, the add comments popup [or whatever it is supposed to be] never appears.  Perhaps my understanding that adding a comment to my own post doesnt require reputation points is mistaken.  However, now I see that show  more comments isnt working either.  p  pFinally  The problem I am having using this site [the primary symptom of which is the javascript console message Uncaught ReferenceError StackExchange is not defined ] is the same one discussed here a hrefhttpmeta.stackexchange.comquestions117730stackoverflowonclickactionsbrokenhttpmeta.stackexchange.comquestions117730stackoverflowonclickactionsbrokena about a year ago.p

Particularly when searching in Javascript I pick up multiple function declarations instead of the one nearest to the callvariable that I am looking for.p  pfor example I am looking for the function that calls the method save data I have learnt, from this excellent site that I can use s to switch . to include newlinesp  precodefunction.s.savedata codepre  phowever, that will find the first instance of the word function and then all the text unto and including savedatap  pif there are multiple procedures then it will start at the next function and repeat until it gets to savedata againp  precodefunctions.savedata does something similar codepre  pI have tried asking it to ignore the second function I believe by using something likep  precodefunctions.function.savedata codepre  pBut that doesnt work.p  pI have done some investigation with look forwards and look backwards but either I am doing it wrong highly possible or they are not the right thing.p  pIn summary I guess, how do I go backwards, from a given word to the nearest occurrence of a different word.p  pAt the moment I am using this to search through some javascript files to try and understand the structurecalls etc but ultimately I am hoping to use on c files and some vb.net filesp  pMany thanks in advancep  pThanks for the swift responses and sorry for not added an example block of code  which I will do now modified but still sufficient to show the issuep  pif I have a simple block of javascript like the followingp  precode    function aCellClickHandlergridName, cellId, button         var stuffhappenshere         var and here         ifsomething or other             if anothertest                   event.returnValuefalse                 event.cancelBubbletrue                 return true                           else                 event.returnValuefalse                 event.cancelBubbletrue                 return true                                  function aDblClickHandlergridName, cellId         var userRow  rowfromsomewhere         var userCell  cellfromsomewhereelse         this will need to save the local data before allowing any inserts to ensure that they are inserted in the correct place         if checkforarangeofthings             if differenttest                  InsSeqNum  insertnumbervalue                 InsRowID  arow.getValue                 blnWasInsert  true                 blnWasDoubleClick  true                 SaveData                                  codepre  prunning the regex against this  including the second one that was identified as should be working Sublime Text 2 will select everything from the first function through to SaveDatap  pI would like to be able to get to just the dblClickHandler in this case  not both.p  pHopefully this code snippet will add some clarity and sorry for not posting originally as I hoped a standard code file would suffice.p
Negative 28135 pIm using a custom scroll bar and the problem Im facing now is that when I have thousands of rows in a datagrid and scroll all the way to the bottom, codedataGrid.VerticalScrollingOffsetcode is about  400 higher thank codecustomScrollbar.Valuecode. Which ends up with dataGrid now showing last few records, because it hasnt scrolled down enough.p  pIt would be perfect if I could set codedataGrid.VerticalScrollingOffsetcode value or get the maximum vertical scrolling value of dataGrid, I couldnt find any information on nether. p  pCurrently Im calculating the maximum value like coderowCountrowHeightcode, which doesnt give exact max value, therefore its not scrolling down all the way.

Negative 28135 pWe need to generate a TFS repository from a Git source code base, we would like to preserve the original commit history, so I tried to use TfGit git tf checkin deep command that is supposed to create a TFS changeset for each Git commit.p  pUnfortunately this step fails because a lot of commits in the Git repo have two parents due to merges, and TFS requires commit history to be linear to be able to import it. So I am getting the following errorp  precodegittf cannot check in  commit 2b15822 has multiple parents, please rebase to form a linear history or use shallow or autosquash codepre  pThis is understandable. But what can be done about it if the existing Git repo has a long chain of such commits I know its possible to spend a day or two revising commit history manually, but thats not what we want to spend our days on. Do I understand correctly that there is no automated way of fixing commit history to become linear, so unless we want to spend many hours on manual work, we should just import the whole history as a single changesetp

Negative 28135 pOk, its been almost 2 days since I started to look for the solution, no hope yet. We are developing a realtime action game using flash. Different players connect to each other with peertopeer connection. So I test this application on my computer, with two or more clients simultaniously. Now as theres a P2P connection between different clients, and all of them are running on my computer, theres almost no latency between them at all 510 ms so when I test it looks ok, and when we test it through the internet with greater latencies up to 100 ms, some synchronisation problems occur. Its impossible for me to test this application through the internet all the time, as I need to see the difference between clients to understand what is to be changed.p  pSince the connection between clients is working seamlessly, I cant find out which ports do these clients use, so I cant actually use all those localhost proxy programs. I found out about a great tool WANem, which can add some latency on all traffic passing through it. So the main problem is  I cant reroute my localhost 127.0.0.1 traffic through anything, a command p  precoderoute add 127.0.0.1 mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.0.15 codepre  pdoesnt work at all. and if Im trying to add a localhost interface to itp  precoderoute add 127.0.0.1 mask 255.255.255.255 192.168.0.15 if 0x1 codepre  pit just prints out some errors. 192.168.0.15 is an IP adress of the WANemp  pEverything except routing my localhost traffic is working just fine.p  pOnce again  I searched almost through the whole internet, and there was nothing about routing localhost traffic on windows. And maybe theres another way of adding some latency to the localhost without knowing the ports.p

I suppose cookies would work here, but we cant guarantee that people wont flush their cookies. How close can we get to unique identifiability What strategies can be used.p

Negative 28135 pThis is a metaquestion. How does one, using the codeINFORMATIONSCHEMAcode provided with each database, discover the return values of a stored procedure With functions, the return value is explicitly declared and shows up in the codeINFORMATIONSCHEMAcode under codeROUTINEScode. p  pHowever, stored procedures seem to be a bizarre grey area as always is the distinction between SPs and functions. They seem to officially have no return value, but yet at the end you can run a SELECT statement such asp  precodeSELECT RowID  RowID codepre  pFor example and in C you read the return value from the column RowID. This makes it clear that stored procedures actually are capable of returning values, albeit not within the context of TSQL code like functions do.p  pHow does one discover these values and their types without having to parse the definition itselfp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIf you are searching for this, the return values of stored procedures are integers implicitly, but also can return data called emresult setsem.p

Negative 28135 pIs this possiblep  pI have a package that needs to be copied to three 3 different servers. Each server is used for a different testing environment.

The only difference amongst the 3 servers would be the content inside the strong.dtsConfigstrong file. The config files contain directories for the excel, log, and SQL server connection for each environment.p  pFor example. Lets say I have a package called strongCars.dtsxstrong. This package is EXACTLY the same amongst all three servers. The package file points to a strong.dtsConfigstrong file that is in the strongConfigFilesstrong folder which is found on all three servers. I want a way for the package to point to the strongConfigFilesCars.dtsConfigstrong file on each server, but I want to do it without having to provide the name of the server in the directory.p  pThe way I tried it is using strongProjectDir..ConfigFilesCars.dtsConfigstrong which seems to work if I run the package through the .sln file rather than the .dtsx file.p  pI hope that wasnt too confusing.

But the problem I have is that it doesnt detect collision with the projectiles correctly, since the lasers position is always 0,0 because its added to the player and not the scene.p  pHeres my code p  pstrongPlayer.mstrongp  precode bool activateSuper bool activated  NO if powerReady      NSLogSuper Activated     activated  YES     state  pSuper      Super sprite which is supposed to collide with projectiles     sprSuper  [CCSprite spriteWithSpriteFrameNameLaser.png]     sprSuper.anchorPoint  ccp0.5, 0.0     sprSuper.position  ccpself.contentSize.width2, self.contentSize.height     [self addChildsprSuper]      Delete     int duration  5     [self runAction[CCSequence actionOne[CCDelayTime actionWithDurationduration]                                       two[CCCallBlock actionWithBlock         [self removeChildsprSuper cleanupYES]         powerReady  NO         curSuper  0         state  pOK     ]]]      Empty super bar     GameScene g  GameScene[self parent]     [g.gameHUD emptyBarduration]   return activated  codepre  pIn strongGameScene.mstrong For collision detectionp  precode void updateccTimedt Projectile pToRemove  nil for Projectile p in projectiles      if player.state  pSuper ampamp CGRectIntersectsRectp.boundingBox, player.sprSuper.boundingBox          pToRemove  p         break        if pToRemove  nil [self destroyProjectilepToRemove]   codepre  pWhat do you think I should focus on Is there an easy way of detecting the collision, or should I add the Laser in the scene and add code to make it move with the playerp  pThank you really much for your answerp

To explain, I need to elaborate a little on the example code above so that it more accurately reflects my context. That context isnt actually console output but rather, unit testing. I want to verify that my code is correctly protecting against XSS attacks, so I had written the unit test using mochasinonchaishouldp  precodev.el.text.should.equalm.escapeattr codepre  pThat test was failing unexpectedly, while the following test was passing and I didnt think it should have beenp  precodev.el.text.should.equalm.getattr codepre  pThe culprit turns out to the be the codetoStringcode method on the element object. That method, which codeconsole.logcode uses, unescapes the content. That method is also indirectly used by jQuery in the codetextcode function.p  pIm not certain that this is universal in all browsers, but in my case using code.innerHTMLcode avoids the codetoStringcode unescape. So the correct way to write my test isp  precodev.el.innerHTML.should.equalm.escapeattr codepre

Negative 28135 pIm learning node.js and interested in is there any difference between following two cases. I.E.

In node.js mans it said that Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded. And I cant understand is this module cached or not.p  pAnother case That codemyvarcode can be passed as parameter to module functions. So code will look likep  psubmodule.jsp  precodefunction funcoption     ...     var something  option     ...  exports.func  func codepre  pmodule1.jsp  precodevar submodule  require.submodule function funcoption     ...     submodule.funcoption     ...     var something  option     ...  exports.func  func codepre  pSo the question is  Is there any difference between this two cases or they are samep

Each thread has to fetch 4 consecutive floats and I thought fetching them all on a single transaction would be better. So I tried to access them as a single float4 ...p  pCompiler doesnt complain, memchecker doesnt get any wrong either. Running it on debug mode seems to work not sure, cant test the results. But on release mode it gives an unknown error. It seems that if I try to access a float4 I have to do it aligned to 128B, is this correct if it is, why memchecker doesnt complain Why it does work on debug and doesnt on releasep  pBTW if I perform 4 transactions for doing the operation one float at time, it works.p

Negative 28135 pI have a situation where a user may have to upload multiple text files, which are then saved on the file system. Instead of asking the user to repeat the same act multiple times I want to give them an option to upload a zip file where files are saved in a particular format.p  pThere are 2 ways to do it.p  ol lipAsk them to upload a zip file. Unzip the file at the server and save the independent files. If I do the whole thing in memory there is a risk of using up too much memory, so the logical thing would be to save the zip file on filesystem. But since we are deployed on Amazon, it will involve saving on S3 which further increase the latency from EC2 to S3 and I dont want the headache of tracking the Zip file as well.pli lipOther option is to unzip the file on the client side itself and then individually upload the files, this way I dont need to keep track of the zip file. But i am unable to understand how can I unzip a file on the client side and iterate through multiple filesfolders in it.pli ol  pIf there is any easierless messier way of doing it with the first approach, I am open to that as well. The backend is in Django.p  pWould sincerely appreciate any help.p

Response.Cookies.AddmyCookie codepre  pSo if I logged in, everything works and the below code evaluates to true       HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticatedp  pHowever, if I wanted to include subkeys to myCookie using either versionsp  precode  myCookie.Values.AdduserName, patrick version 1   myCookie.Values[userName]  patrick  version 2 codepre  pThen you add to the cookies collectionp  precode  Response.Cookies.AddmyCookie codepre  pThen refresh the page after loginp  precode  This always set to false even after successful log on   HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated codepre  pNo clue whyp  pI wanted to do something where I dont have to add the encryption value to the httpcookie immediatelyp  precode IsAuthenticated doesnt work  false  HttpCookie cookie  new HttpCookieFormsAuthentication.FormCookieName  cookie.Values.AddencryptTicket, encTicket codepre  pIts just weird that adding subkeys dont work at all. And that I am forced to encypt a ticket in order to make it work. What I mean, is that IsAuthenticated is false all the time, logged in and authenticated or not. Can anyone try to explain whats going on with this I have a working solution, but any insight would be helpful.p

Negative 28135 pstrongATTENTION This was not a cache problem, nor a server misconfiguration, nor a browser issue. After careful investigation, Ive found the problem was due to a problem in my codestrong Stupidly enough, my select query that populates the fields preceded my update query, causing the form to always show the values before the update. After reloading, of course the newly updated values would appear, causing me to look in the wrong direction. p  pThis question however shows a nice overview of all the possible solutions when facing a caching problem.p  hr  pIm building an application on which there are forms, populated by values from a database. The user can change the input values of the form. After submitting not via AJAX, the new values are saved to the database AND the same form is displayed again, this time containing the new values, loaded straight from the database. However my browser Chrome v27.0.1453.116m on Windows 7 caches the old values.

Negative 28135 pI am making demo videos of my iOS apps, some of which I made with XCode and others of which I made in Unity3D.  I plan to use the Elgato Game Capture HD to capture my demo videos but I am not sure how to show the taps.  I found Touchpose, but when I changed the main.m as suggested by the instructions on the GitHub page I got error messages saying that QAppDelegate and QTouchposeApplication were undefined.  I added import QTouchposeApplication but got an error message suggesting I change QAppDelegate to AppDelegate.  When I did this the build failed.  When I left it as QAppDelegate, added QAppDelegate to the project and imported it into the main.m the error messages went away but the build still failed.  Am I doing something incorrectly  I found no tutorials on Touchpose online and am confused.  Alternatively, is there some other easy solution, for example using the Elgato software or some other software or framework  I also tried Reflector but my wifi is not fast enough to support good frame rates with it.  I am aware that I could use unity and build for OSX or in the case of XCode apps just screen record the simulator but I would prefer a single, foolproof solution for all of my apps.  Thanksp

Negative 28135 pI am currently building an iOS app that allows the user to have multiple accounts logged in at the same time.  I want to use keychain to hold the users account credentials, which is easy if you are dealing with one account. p  pI cant seem to find a good example of dealing with multiple accounts in keychain. Is it just a case of creating a new instance of KeychainItemWrapper with a different identifier every time a new account is added p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 28135 pSo Ive spent a bit of time looking at MySQLi and Im having trouble updating a script with the new functions. This script is used for a dynamic dropdown form, using data sent to it using JS. You can find a live version of the script stronga hrefhttpnew.foxmeter.comfind.php relnofollow titlefind.phphereastrong to check out what Im takling about. Ive looked up and down my code and have compared it to other MySQLi examples and Im just not sure where Im going wrong.p  pNow, the first dropdown doesnt even initiate a query, all the PHP does is return predefined results as its just simpler for the first option. Whats weird, to me, is that even the first drop down is now not working when it does not rely at all on the MySQLi connection. It all worked before updating, just for reference.p  pHeres my scriptp  precodedb  new mysqlidbHost, dbUser, dbPass, dbDatabase  ifdbgtconnecterrno gt 0     dieUnable to connect to database [ . dbgtconnecterror . ]   prevents injections any order issetGET[type]type  urldecodeGET[type] issetGET[source]source  dbgtrealescapestringurldecodeGET[source] issetGET[range]power  dbgtrealescapestringurldecodeGET[range] issetGET[setpoint]setpoint  dbgtrealescapestringurldecodeGET[setpoint]  forms the query depending on what data is recieved through GET first option on the bottom last option on the top to avoid conflicts  if issetGET[setpoint]      query  SELECT DISTINCT stp FROM meters WHERE siorange AND psopower AND stpsetpoint ORDER BY model  elseif issetGET[power]      query  SELECT DISTINCT stp FROM meters WHERE siorange AND psopower ORDER BY model  elseif issetGET[range]      query  SELECT DISTINCT pso FROM meters WHERE siorange ORDER BY model  elseif issetGET[source]      query  SELECT DISTINCT sir FROM meters WHERE sio LIKE source ORDER BY sir   creates a result array from query results issetqueryresult  dbgtqueryquery  outputs dropdown options dependent on what GET variables are set first option on the bottom last option on the top to avoid conflicts if issetGET[setpoint]      while row  resultgtfetchassoc          echo ltoption value . row[stp] . gt . row[stp] . ltoptiongt     resultgtfree       elseif issetGET[power]      echo ltoptiongtPlease Choose Setpoint Optionsltoptiongt     while row  resultgtfetchassoc          rowstp  ucfirstrowstp capitalizes the first letter necessary         echo ltoption value . row[stp] . gt . row[stp] . ltoptiongt     resultgtfree       elseif issetGET[source]      echo ltoptiongtPlease Choose Input Rangeltoptiongt     while row  resultgtfetchassoc          echo ltoption value . row[sir] . gt . row[sir] . ltoptiongt     resultgtfree       elseif issetGET[type] ampamp GET[type]  Digital      echo ltoptiongtPlease Choose Input Sourceltoptiongt     echo ltoption valueRS232CgtRS232Cltoptiongtltoption valueRS422gtRS422ltoptiongtltoption valueRS485gtRS485ltoptiongtltoption valuecurrent loopgtcurrent loopltoptiongt     resultgtfree  elseif issetGET[type] ampamp GET[type]  Analog      echo ltoptiongtPlease Choose Input Sourceltoptiongt     echo ltoption valueDC currentgtDC Currentltoptiongtltoption valueDC voltagegtDC Voltageltoptiongtltoption valueAC currentgtAC Currentltoptiongtltoption valueAC voltagegtAC Voltageltoptiongtltoption valueprocessgtProcessltoptiongtltoption valuethermocouplegtThermocoupleltoptiongtltoption valueRDTgtrdtltoptiongt     resultgtfree  codepre  pedit This is my old code using the deprecated method.p  precodecon  mysqlconnectdbHost, dbUser, dbPass or triggererrorFailed to connect to MySQL Server.

Negative 28135 pRecently Ive been exploring the world of smalltalk dialects and am very impressed from here on in understand that when I write smalltalk Im referencing any of the modern smalltalk dialects  squeakpharoetc. I like the small footprint of the VM and the language itself. p  pAs grad student and often need to write tools that support my research. Typically I use Java because I can easily deploy a tool to my colleagues without worrying too much about what their computer setup is or how tech savvy they are. Its pretty easy to whip up a GUI interface and all the end user has to do is double click on an executable JAR and they are gtg. The problem is that Java has all sorts of security issues and doesnt always run in the same way on every platform. Smalltalk, therefore, is starting to look pretty attractive.  p  pI know that its possible to create a smalltalk program that fires up with one double click of an icon. What Im wondering about is whether or not I can create a sandboxed smalltalk world such that the only thing the user sees and is able to interact with is my application. I dont want them to see any aspect of the smalltalk world. This way, users  cant accidentally muck things up or get confused because they have access to a plethora of options that arent directly relevant to use of the program. Is this possible, and if so, how do I do itp
Negative 28135 pI am new to using armadillo, and could not get the following in spite of trying  searching quite a bit.p  pThere are two huge dynamic arrays not vectors that I need to perform correlation on. I resolved to use armadillo for this. I understand how to initialize armamat using vectors, but can I use arrays to do so I understand not as I dont see any mention in the a hrefhttparma.sourceforge.netdocs.htmlMatdocumentationa. I am trying to avoid the use of vectors for internal design reasons. I tried manually initializing each element using sample arrays as a dumb but starting point. Something like the following code wouldnt work.p  precodeusing namespace std using namespace arma     mat ASIZE, 1, BSIZE, 1  forint i  0 i lt SIZE i      A ltlt v[i] ltlt endr     B ltlt c[i] ltlt endr   cout ltlt A  ltlt endl A.print cout ltlt B  ltlt endl B.print codepre  pFor the input arrays v  1, 2, 0, 1, .9 and c  0, .5, 1, 2, 5. The output will bep  precodeA         0 B   5.0000 codepre  pwhich is understandable. Any work around for initializing armamat or armacolvector with arrays Thanks in advancep

Negative 28135 pI recently deployed my app to heroku and everything is working fine aside from images that are defined in jqueryraty. Basically this gem allows you to easily implement a rating system visually.p  pWhen I push to heroku assets are precompiled and I can see that the images Ive designated to work with jqueryraty are successfully compiled and there names are changed i.e., image.png becomes imagef96e0d1182b422c912116f08ac8f7d78.png. All is well  but Ive found that when deployed to heroku this new name is not reflected. That is, the image is trying to be pulled from a hrefhttpsmyapp.herokuapp.comassetsimage.png relnofollowhttpsmyapp.herokuapp.comassetsimage.pnga instead of a hrefhttpsmyapp.herokuapp.comassetsimagef96e0d1182b422c912116f08ac8f7d78.png relnofollowhttpsmyapp.herokuapp.comassetsimagef96e0d1182b422c912116f08ac8f7d78.pnga. p  pThis is my issue  I have no clue at this point how to get the urls pointing correctly. p  pHas anyone else found a solution to thisp  pThank you.p

Negative 28135 pI wanted to create a system to track the progress of a player in a game. Each player can be a member of multiple groups, which all have other requirements. In order to track his progress, the stats of the player will be saved once he joins a group. Every time he reloads his stats, the current ones should be saved inside the database.p  pAll stats of the player are stored in a jsonformat, which will then be parsed either by PHP or JS. An entry with compare  0 is set once the player joins a group. An entry with compare  1 should be created the first time a player clicks on iUpdate Statsi and from then on it should only be updated, not newly created.p  pNow my question is How to achieve that When reading through the syntax of INSERT INTO I got the followingp  precodeINSERT INTO groups grp, id, json, compare VALUES  grp, id, json, 1 ON DUPLICATE KEY SET json  json codepre  pHowever, since there is no key set, and I dont know if I can set up twothree keys as there can be multiple groups per user, as well as the compare  0 entry in the same group, I dont think I can do it this way.p  precode  grp   id  json     compare     1     1   stats      0       1     1   stats      1       1     2   stats      0       1     2   stats      1       2     2   stats      0       2     3   stats      0       2     3   stats      1       2     4   stats      0       2     5   stats      0      codepre  pcodegrpcode is the group of the player. There is no real limit set to the      number of groups a player can be in.p  pcodeidcode is the ID of the player.p  pcodejsoncode contains the stats of the player in a json      format number of points, etc.p  pcodecomparecode is a boolean. 0 stands for entry stats the number of points a player  already had when he registered and 1 stands for the current stats  Which will  be compared to the entry stats, in order to get the difference  the points a  player made since joining the group.p  pI hope my explanation was understandable and someone can help me out.p

Negative 28135 pIn all the explanations Ive read regarding Digest authentication they talk about password hash being saved already on the server.p  pWhat Im asking about is the registration process how did that hashed password get there in first placep  pDoes that mean the implementation of strongPrestrong digest authentication is open to ones imagination i.e while registration the server would generate a password and send it via email, or use an ssl connection when the user is registering only or what  Is there some kind of standard process which comes with Digest authentication that I missed p  pNote Im not implementing Im only studying I know Digest authentication has weaknesses and there are better ways, I just wanted to have full image of the whole process.p  pNote 2 I notice someone voting to close the question its not programming question, I believe there is tiny misconception when I said Im not implementing I mean in note 1 I mean not implementing in real production project, but I want to understand the concept of Digest authentication is implemented and my question is still as it clear and simple how did the password got in the server in the first place.p

Negative 28135 pWhat Im trying to do with this GUI is having the person browse for a txt file, and then reading it. When the person clicks the Read File button, they should be prompted to choose a file, and then it will read the file and set various values. I am having a few problems with this. First, Im using scanner to try and set the values, though I am not sure that is the best way. Second, Im not sure if the file is even being read. I can get the browse for file dialogue to open, but then it freezes, and I have to restart eclipse. How can I use JFileChooser to read a file and set values by reading itp  precode    import javax.swing.     import java.awt.     import java.awt.event.     import java.io.File     import

Negative 28135 pAlright, there are 2 ways to send a file to Recyle Bin in .net, either use codeMicrosoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.DeleteFilecode or use codeSHFileOperationcode. Both works good but they delete file permanently if it cant fit inside Recycle Bin.  Is it somehow possible that it can throw Exception or return boolean value if file is too big or just simply do not delete it  Do not want default confirm dialogp  pOne way I got was to get the max size of Recycle Bin allowed for the volume then subtract the used size and check if file will get send to RB or deleted permanently, but it may get bad if deleting many files and check again and again.p  pAnything else I can try p

Negative 28135 pIm running into a bit of an issue. I have some asp.net controls wrapped in an update panel, but when I click the submit button it jumps to the top of the page. Ive read a bunch of posts on here, and they either require use of some javascript or say set the MaintainPagePostion to true in the page directive. I tried setting it to true, that did not work. I really dont want to use a javascript script to accomplish this either. I was under the impression that this is one of the benefits to using an update panel. However, the part that I find most confusing, is it used to not do this. I dont remember changing anything on the website that would have caused this. Any help with this problem is appreciated.

Negative 28135 pIm messing around with the cheapest .NET Arvixe server for learning purposes and try to install an application Umbraco in this case in a particular way.p  pArvixe counts subdomains as websites, which means Im currently limited to 6 of them. With some clever URL Rewrite trickery, I managed to setup the following structure.p  precodeFTPfolder gt mydomain.com gtgt wwwroot gtgt subdomains gtgtgt subdomain1 gtgtgt subdomain2 gtgtgt etc. codepre  pcodewwwrootcode is the main website, under which I added Virtual Directories for each subdomain. So if in the browser you would go to a hrefhttpwww.mydomain.comsubdomain1 relnofollowhttpwww.mydomain.comsubdomain1a, youll end up seeing whatever app is installed under codesubdomainssubdomain1code.p  pAfter applying some URL Rewrite, I can go to a hrefhttpsubdomain1.mydomain.com relnofollowhttpsubdomain1.mydomain.coma, and it will show me the same content as if I would go to a hrefhttpwww.mydomain.comsubdomain1 relnofollowhttpwww.mydomain.comsubdomain1ap  pNow this is where the problem Im experiencing begins.p  pWhenever in code I would do a relative path eg. codeBlogTest123.aspxcode, it will resolve to a hrefhttpsubdomain1.mydomain.comsubdomain1BlogTest123.aspx relnofollowhttpsubdomain1.mydomain.comsubdomain1BlogTest123.aspxa. This all still works, as the everything is still under a single website, I just dont want the subdomain1 part in the URL. If I manually remove the subdomain1 part, the page also render fine due to my rewrite rules.p  pAfter some searching I found out that internally, whenever code has to resolve a codecodeurl, it will use codeHttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPathcode for that.p  pHow can I trick ASP.NET into thinking its hosting under the Virtual App Path of  rather than subdomain1p  pI have tried a few things which do not work or I just did it wrong  codeThread.GetDomain.SetData.appVPath, code  Make a codeVirtualPathProvidercodep  pIn all cases, it will throw exceptions.p  pIs hosting under its own website really the only solution which means I have to upgrade the accountp

I dont want to accidently type yes  with a space and have devmode off. p  pSo back to the questionp  phow would I make it so I can just do thisp  precodedef debug     printDebug Mode     while True         global egg         choice  input         if choice  yes or Yes             devdebug  1             break         elif choice  no or No             devdebug  0             break         elif choice  egg             devdebug  0             egg  1             printEaster is Here             break         else             printYes or No  codepre  pThe above code probably isnt the best example, but it at least helps me get my point across when I say I only want one if statement per word. Also, I hope I didnt just solve my own problem here xDp  pSo, how would I do thisp  pAlso, the reason I go here rather than the python forums is because I prefer to ask my question in my own way rather than trying to piece together an answer from a question that was worded differently for someone else.p

Negative 28135 pIm using a codeScheduledExecutorServicecode to close a network connection if it has been open for more than several hours. In most cases however, the network connection is closed before the timeout is reached, so I cancel the codeScheduledFuturecode. In this case, I also want the executor service to terminate and to release its thread pool.p  pTo my surprise, this does not work out of the box Although I have called codeshutdowncode on the executor service after scheduling the task, the executor service does not terminate automatically when its only scheduled task is cancelled.

Negative 28135 pI have seen in many places including Apple Dev Forum that to test async operations some developers recommend grabbing current run loop and let it run for a while to force async blocks to get called. e.g.p  precodeblock id returnedModel  nil BOOL result  [binder fetchAndBind...                       successBlockid model  returnModel  model                          errorBlocknil]  NSDate loopUntil  [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow10.0f]  BOOL isModelReturned  returnedModel  nil  while isModelReturned ampamp [loopUntil timeIntervalSinceNow] gt 0      [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runModeNSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDateloopUntil]     isModelReturned  returnedModel  nil  codepre  pThere are differnet flavors to the above implementation but the concept is the same. Some are using codedispatchgroupcode, etc.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul lipDoes Apple have any documentation about testing async operations I couldnt find anypli lipFrom unofficial sources I have read that unit tests are selfcontained in the run loop they are running. So they are not supposed to be treated as above. Is that true Is this documented by Apple somewherepli lipWith Xcode 5.1 the above implenetation or codedispatchgroupcode result in codeEXCBADACCESS code2, address0xdcode. Is it because of the concept that unit test are selfcontained in their own thread and should not be treated like thispli ul  pI have seen problems and side effects with such approaches, particualrly if one or more objects in that test are mocked. Side effects like causing the app to crash so that unit tests cant be completed. For example a method in codeClass Acode that its public API takes an codeNSArraycode as input crashed because a test mocked an object, let run loop continue, that object then started interacting with codeClass Acode and since it was mocked, it passed in a dictionary  whereas if run loop was not forced to continue, the object would have been unmocked later and every test would be happyp  pI personally think there is no reason to test codeasynccode. There is an operation thats running in an async fashion. It is that strongemoperationfunctionemstrong that needs to be tested not codeasynccode.p  pI am looking for some references or documentation perferrably from Apple to clearly talk about async unit tests, whether the run loop of a unit test can be forced to continue, or what is the recommended approach for testing async operations with XCTests.p  pThanksp  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pIn Xcode 6 the XCTest framework ships with async testing macros.

Negative 28135 pHi I am trying to implement a pause feature in my libgdx game but am having trouble pausing the animations that happen every 5 seconds.  In my render method I restart the animations every 5 seconds.  Once the animation is finished I stop drawing it and they work as expected restarting and drawing every 5 seconds.  However when I hit the pause button the current animation finishes off which is ok but as soon as I unpause the game it would immediately redraw another animation rather than waiting until the next 5 second time slot.  I think this is because TimeUtils.millis is still greater than 5 seconds as soon as I unpause causing it to immediately fire again so how would I reset the timming to prevent this.  Thanks.p  precode ifTimeUtils.millisgtTimePassedtimekeep.timecheckampamp pausedfalse                                 every N seconds and if not paused        System.out.printlnRendering.....       stateTime 0                               reset animation         forint i0ilttimekeep.rndy1i             c.e.geti.alivetrue  set all characters to alive to be drawn             TimePassed  TimeUtils.millis   this is the time passed since last restart       codepre

Negative 28135 h3What I am trying to doh3  pI am developing a web application. Super exciting, I know Users should be offered a file for download when clicking on a specific button.

When clicking the button a second time, I am instructing the browser to simply emfollow the linkem which, because of the presence of the codedownloadcode attribute, should result in the browser prompting the user about whether or not they would like to download the generated content.p  h3The Problemh3  pCurrently, the browser is refusing to follow the link. emTriggeringem the codeclickcode event on the button works, because I can successfully codealertcode or codeconsole.logcode a message before codereturn truecode in the codeelsecode portion of the code.p  h3Additional observationsh3  pThe problem goes away if I remove the asynchronous computation and instead populate the codeBlobcode with some arbitrary data.p  pAlso, if I replace p  precodebutton.attrhref, url button.click codepre  pwithp  precodewindow.location  url codepre  pthe browser emwillem follow the link, but instead of offering to download the file it will display the contents on a new page.p

Negative 28135 pIm using the Haskell FFI with a C library that defines a number of codestructcode types containing members which are pointers to codedoublecodes, intended to be treated as arrays of codedoublecodesp  precodetypedef struct Foo    int length   double values  FooT codepre  pIn my Haskell bindings to this library I have an equivalent data type in which Im trying to use codeData.Vector.Storable.Vector Doublecode for the arrayp  precodedata Foo  Foo    length  Int,   values  Data.Vector.Storable.Vector Double  deriving Show, Eq codepre  pIn order to marshall data between the C library and my Haskell code, of course, I have to write codeStorablecode instances for these types. Im trying to work out a way of using codeData.Vector.Storable.unsafeFromForeignPtrcode to create Haskell codeVectorcodes from the codedoublecode arrays that the C library has allocated and populated on the heap. Im hoping that by doing this I can avoid copying the contents of the codedoublecode arrays and just have the codeVectorcode as a kind of wrapper over the array. Side question would be given that the codedoublecode arrays can be up to 10,000s of codedoublecodes, is it worth pursuing this noncopyingp  pThis is what I have so far.

However, codepeekcode generates code like thisp  precodevaluesField lt  hscptr gt peekByteOff hscptr 16 ptr  IO ForeignPtr Double codepre  pand gets stuck because theres no codeStorablecode instance for codeForeignPtr Doublecode. I think if I tried to implement an instance for codeForeignPtr Doublecode I would just be commuting the problem of how to access the address value of a codestructcode member to the codepeekcode implementation for that instance.p  pSo in summary, how can I access an address value i.e. pointer codestructcode member in such a way that I can use it as an argument to codeunsafeFromForeignPtrcodep

Negative 28135 pVery often, when I program, I use polymorphism because it naturally models the objects that I need. On the other hand I very often use standard containers to store these objects, and I tend to avoid pointers because this either requires me to free up the objects instead of popping them off the stack or requires me to know for sure the objects will stay on the stack while I use the pointer. Of course there are all kinds of pointercontainer objects that sort of do this task for you, but in my experience they are also not ideal or even annoying. That is if such a simple solution existed, it would have been in the c language, right  p  pSo lets have a classic examplep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt  struct foo  struct goo  public foo  struct moo  public foo   int main      stdvectorltfoogt foos     foos.pushbackmoo     foos.pushbackgoo     foos.pushbackgoo     foos.pushbackmoo      return 0  codepre  pSee a hrefhttpideone.comaEVoSi relnofollowhttpideone.comaEVoSia . This works fine, and if the objects have different sizeofs the compiler may apply slicing. However, due to the the fact that c knows no instanceof like Java, and to the best of my knowledge no adequate alternative exists, one cannot access the properties of the inherited classes after fetching them as a foo from the vector.p  pHence one would use virtual function, however this disallows one to allocate a foo, and hence one is not permitted to use them in a vector. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2160920whycantwedeclareastdvectorabstractclassWhy can39t we declare a stdvectorltAbstractClassgta .p  pFor example I may want to be able to print both subclasses, simple feature, rightp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt  struct foo          virtual void print 0         virtual foo    struct goo  public foo      int a     void print  stdcout ltlt goo    struct moo  public foo      int a,b     void print  stdcout ltlt moo    int main      stdvectorltfoogt foos     foos.pushbackmoo     foos.pushbackgoo     foos.pushbackgoo     foos.pushbackmoo      forfooamp f  foos          f.print          return 0  codepre  pSource a hrefhttpideone.comI4rYn9 relnofollowhttpideone.comI4rYn9ap  pThis is a simple addition, as a designer I would never think of wanting this behavior in foresight. I would already be so thrilled by the fact that c was able to slice my objects and hence store objects of different sizes in one vector. Unfortunately it cannot do so anymore when the base class is abstract, as stated here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2160920whycantwedeclareastdvectorabstractclassWhy can39t we declare a stdvectorltAbstractClassgtap  pThe general emgood solutionem seems to be to use pointers. But this 1 forces me to do memory management and 2 Id need to change interfaces and recode a lot of things.

Negative 28135 pIve been able to find how to count duplicates, but I want to take it a step further.  Right now I have a roster of players in a game, I want to count how many Alts each person has.  So for examplep  precodeName  Rank Jim    12 Steve  15 Josh   25 Jim    05 Josh   02 Kim    22 Steve  02 Adam   05 Josh   01 codepre  pSo basic enough, but it gets the point across.  Right now if I try to find duplicates I would get the number 7 because Jim is there 2 times, Josh is there 3 times, and steve is there 2 times.  However, I just want to count how many alts there are, not duplicates.  So the first instance of a person should be excluded from the count.  So jim has 1 alt, josh has 2 alts, steve has 1 alt.  Is there any way to do this  Maybe count how many duplicates there are, then count how many unique instances there are within the duplicates then subtract that from the total number  Anyone know how I could do this  That way, instead of getting 7 alts which isnt true I would  get 4 because 3 of the duplicates are their main characters.

Negative 28135 pI am teaching myself how to use object oriented programming with MATLAB and have a question about access.p  pI have three current classes that need to interact with each other. One class, which Ill call main, is what the user will interface with or the gui if I build one. Main stores all of the pertinent data that the use may want and has a few methods to perform some preprocessing and to construct the main object. Main also calls the constructors for the two other classes.p  pAnother class, Ill call it instruction, loads information about the steps to process the data this is a recursive process and some other information.p  pThe final class, which Ill call core, performs the core operations of the process.p  pHeres what my question is. Within main I have some helper methods that are used in the preprocessing. I want the access to these helper methods to be private so that the user cannot see or use them. Some of these helper functions also need to be used by the processes in core. My question is how do I grant access to the helper functions in main so that only main and core can access them I have tried to understand the information provided here a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpmatlabmatlaboopselectiveaccesstoclassmethods.html relnofollowhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpmatlabmatlaboopselectiveaccesstoclassmethods.htmla, but when I try something like p  pre classlangmatlab prettyprintoverridecodeclassdef main lt handle this is the main class     properties         core  the core object         instruction  the instruction object     end  properties     methods Access  core,main         ... some code     end  methods end  class codepre  pMatlab gives me this errorp  pre classlangmatlab prettyprintoverridecodeIllegal value for attribute Access.

The top bar, 2. the cover art. This I have no Idea on how to do, and if it is even possible. Another way I could imagine the devs did it, is to have two ViewPagers. One for the song info bar and one for the covert art, which would then share the touch event to slideanimate simultaneously.

If the files arent already loaded e.g. the module hasnt been loaded yet, then occasionally I run into a problem where a javascript function is called, but the external .js file hasnt been loaded yet.  Heres the below function responsible for handling thisp  precodefunction loadFilesType,sURI,sCallback   sType    the type of file to load link, script  sURI the URI of the file to load  sCallback    the code to execute after successfully loading the file var ref  document.createElementsType  if sType  script     ref.setAttributetype,textjavascript    ref.setAttributesrc,sURI  else  if sType  link     ref.setAttributerel,stylesheet    ref.setAttributetype,textcss    ref.setAttributehref,sURI   ref.async  true ref.onreadystatechange  ref.onload  function     var state  ref.readyState    if  sCallback.done ampamp  state  loadedcomplete.teststate      sCallback.done  true      if typeofsCallback  function         callback      else         evalsCallback           document.getElementsByTagNamehead[0].appendChildref  codepre  pThere are several other SO articles that were used for the above functionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8586446dynamicallyloadexternaljavascriptfileandwaitforittoloadwithoutusiDynamically load external javascript file, and wait for it to load  without using JQueryap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1042138javascriptcheckiffunctionexists10421541042154Javascript check if function existsap  pSo the above function will be called likep  precodeloadFilelink,module.csscache0, divModule.hide.loadmodule.phpactioninit.fadeInslow loadFilescript,module.jscache0, initModulereq codepre  pThe first call will load the .html file contents via the module.php call for the module after the .css file has downloaded.  The second call will call the modules js init function after the .js file has downloaded.p  pIt doesnt appear to have any issues with the .css file, but sometimes the module will not load correctly meaning that the layout is rendered correctly, but no values populate which is what happens with the modules js init function.  If I check the Web console in FF, there arent any errors that are thrown.  Any thoughtsp  pThanks, Davep

Negative 28135 pWhen trying to develop a Today Extension for iOS 8 I found a weird issue. It would seem that the View Controller Im using is being recreated every time the user opens Notification Center. This means that there is no data retention and hence no way for me to know if the extension needs to update or not.p  pThe main reason for wanting to do this is that I want to preserve the height of the widget Using codepreferredContentSizecode. The problem is that when the view loads this value always gets reset which leads to the widget jumping around in size. The Stocks widget is an example of how its supposed to work and theyve obviously solved it so there has to be some way of retaining the data between different sessions. I can also tell from the debugger that the process continues to run, so its just down to something in Apples code forcing the View Controller to be recreated.p  pMy question is, is this a bug Or is it based on some setting or some property that Im missing Or is it maybe just the way its supposed to work If so, what is the workaroundp

Negative 28135 pI hope this cutdown version of my previous question sounds much better than earlier. I have a .CSV file frequency  weekly whose header contains the yearweek value in two of the columns which keeps changing every week. For an instance please see below.p  precodestore nbr,city,state,region,item nbr,category,201420 sales,201420 sold qty 1001,Kansas City,MO,2,30945232,7,11,1 1003,Kansas City,KS,3,30945742,6,40,4 2004,New York,NY,6,30995232,11,72,12 6003,Sacramento,CA,4,3025742,3,24,6 9003,Cleveland,OH,9,3057432,12,44,11 6009,Los Angeles,CA,4,3098294,42,35,7 codepre  pI have to check if the data is placed under the right column and then proceed loading that data into the datamart. For this reason, I tried to create a standard header to compare it with the header of this file, which would be something like belowp  precodestore nbr,city,state,region,item nbr,category,XXXXXX sales,XXXXXX sold qty codepre  pIf my file that I am about to load is of the format above, my process should proceed loading the data. If the columns are not in their places, lets say as belowp  precodestore nbr,region,city,state,category,item nbr,201420 sold qty,201420 sales 1001,2,Kansas City,MO,7,30945232,1,11 1003,3,Kansas City,KS,6,30945742,4,40 2004,6,New York,NY,11,30995232,12,72 6003,4,Sacramento,CA,3,3025742,6,24 9003,9,Cleveland,OH,12,3057432,11,44 6009,4,Los Angeles,CA,42,3098294,7,35 codepre  pthen the process should fail. My main concern is  due to the dynamic nature of the fields 7 and 8, I am not able to creatematch the data with the standard header every week. There is no date in the field name and I cannot use sysdate as I might have to use old files with very old dates in the 7th and 8th fields. Could you please suggest me how can I achieve this either using strongcodecatawksedcodestrong or by using any wildcards for the Yearweek value in the header p

Negative 28135 pIve carefully worded the subject of my question so it is right on spotp  pin Eclipse CDT I dont see the tooltip that displays the value of a variable. I.e. when I hover over a variable in the Debug perspective then the tooltip thats supposed to display the value of that variable doesnt appear.p  pIve played around with the CC  Editor  Hovers settings and whats confusing is that I can observe that whatever Im changing there does actually have an effect. In particular when I enable either the Combined Hover or the Debugger hover I see that eclipse is talking with gdb when I hover over a variable and see gdbs response in the console with the GDB traces. E.g. hovering over i yieldsp  precode540,068 74dataevaluateexpression thread 1 frame 0 i 540,068 74done,value0 codepre  pSo far so good, but I dont see the corresponding tooltip. I can press F2 and that will open a simple tooltip showing i  0, but thats not quite what I want. And its not like tooltips in general arent working when I enable modifier keys for the Combined Hover and the Debugger hover and leave the Source hover without modifier key then hovering over a variable will display its declaration in a tooltip as expected. But reverting this setting or pressing modifier keys that would trigger the variable value tooltip still has no effect. Other than, as mentioned above, that gdb traces shows me that eclipse is informed what its supposed to display. Oh and by the way I do remember for sure that this worked once. I also have a very faint recollection that this got on my nerves at some point and I have an even fainter recollection that I may have done something to disable those tooltips. But now Id like to have them back.p  pFor the records, this is a list of what Ive done quit the debugger, restarted it, quit eclipse, restarted it, Ive even logged out of kde logged back into gnome, tried it there, logged out of gnome and logged back into kde, tried it again, restore defaults in CC  Editor  Hovers and CC  Debug  GDB. No luck. I think these were all the tips I could find On The Internet that apparently solved similar issues for other people. emsighemp  pAny hints would be immensely appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 28135 pIn my company, I have seen some code that searches Windows Registry for some keys and returns an IEnumerable where T is an object that holds the values and the data of the registry keys that match the find pattern.  The method that does this processing uses yieldreturn pattern.  The registry key is closed after the foreach that contains the yieldreturn completes.p  pMy question is whether it is a safe way to access the Windows registry  Since the key is not closed until the iteration is complete, what would be the impact if, say there is a power failuresystem crash, considering that there might be arbitrary delays before the iteration completes p  pI might also mention that at any point of time, the number of elements returned would only be a handful  say 20 at maximum.p

Negative 28135 pMy goal is to have 2 databases and 2 deployments of rails on the same server. I want to have the regular production server using the production database. Then I want to be able to deploy to a different web address that will use a different database. My goal is to be able to push the backup first and make sure all the migrations etc. work in the full environment. I would then push it to the main server. p  pThe issue I seem to run into is that the database.ml file only lists the 3 database types. The passenger environment will also assume that its running in production and would migrate the main MySQL database even if I deploy the code to a different directory. Whats the best way around this Was wondering if it is simple or if it involves setting lots of variables in lots of places Any suggestions would be greatp
Negative 28135 pIm currently trying to implement a function that deletes a specific struct which is already saved in a binary file. Im a little confused on how to do it. I have a solution that will work but isnt particularly elegant I could read the entire file of structs to a vector of structs, delete the old file, delete the struct I want to remove from the vector, then save the vector of structs as a file again. Im pretty confident this would work but if the file is large it seems like a lengthy and perhaps unnecessary solution. I know how to find the struct I want to delete, and I know how to change the values in it by overwriting it but how exactly can I delete itp  pThis is how I save my structp  precodestdfstream binaryfilefileLocation.cstr, stdiosout  stdiosbinary  stdiosapp binaryfile.writereinterpretcastltchar gtampmyStruct, sizeofmyStruct binaryfile.close codepre  peach struct has an integer with its unique ID, I use that to find the appropriate struct like sop  precodemyStream.openfileLocation.cstr, stdiosin  stdiosout  stdiosbinary     while myStream.eof              myStream.readreinterpretcastltchargtampmyStruct, sizeofmyStruct         if myStruct.ID  givenID                      tempfstream.seekgsizeofmyStruct, stdioscur             delete struct             return               codepre  pIm at a loss at what to do here, is it even possible Ive toyed around with the idea of just flagging the struct as invalid so even though my program will read it it wont use it for anything, but again, seems like a poor idea.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 28135 pHello there fellow iOS programmers. While creating an app Ive ran into a problem I cant seem to find an answer to. Lets lay it outp  pIm creating a UIViewController with a UIScrollView as its only child. Inside this view I have a UIView, and inside of this there is a list of UIViews with UILabels inside them. As you all know you need to specify a contentSize for a UIScrollView. The problem is that the list needs to be dynamic with its content, and I therefore have no way to know the views heights beforehand. Im adding all views with constraints where the height is set to 0. When I later try to set the height of the UIScrollView I need to either get the height of the UIView that the list is inside, or get the origin.y and height of the last view in the list. This of course needs to be ready by the time the view is displayed to the user.p  pIve currently tried view.systemLayoutSizeFittingSizeUILayoutFittingCompressedSize, which returned 0 view.systemLayoutSizeFittingSizeUILayoutFittingExpandedSize, which returned 10000 and view.origin.y  view.frame.height, which also returns 0. It seems to me like the constraints havent taken effect yet.p  pIve tried setting both constraints and UIScollView.contentSize from viewDidLoad. Ive also tried to set constraints in viewDidLoad and setting contentSize in viewWillAppear this yielded the same results. Setting constraints in viewWillAppear and setting contentSize in viewDidLoad only caused a crash.p  pstrongBottomlinestrong When should I set up the UIScrollView.contentSize if I want to get view.height or similar methods to return a correct result, while at the same time be ready by the time the user sees the viewp  pBtw, Im making this app in Swift, so answers in this language is preferred, but Im able to translate from ObjectiveC to Swift post in whatever suits you best.p  pThank you p

I then override the a hrefhttpsgithub.comcoleiferpeeweeblobmasterpeewee.pyL3546L3565 relnofollowpeewee save methoda to not only save the codePersoncode object, but also copy all attributes into a codePersonRevisioncode object and save that as well. Since I will never actually directly interact with the codePersonRevisioncode class I dont need shadowing or any fancy stuff.

Negative 28135 pIm running through some samples on Asp.net Web Api 2 and the project I will eventually be working on is going to utilise AngularJs. A couple of the databinding scenarios Im working on will have angulars codewatchcode implemented and as I understand it, having the codedeepcode flag set to true on this function will notify of new and old values, but not at the property level  only at the array object level. The ultimate goal is to be able to isolate a property change and send this change as a codePATCHcode request to Web Api rather than send the entire object as a PUT request.p  pThe sample I have is currently using knockoutJs and the approach has a model that represents the data where the property values that need to be watched are set as codeobservablepropNamecode. My question is basically whether or not I can convert the following knockoutJs code to something similar in Angularp  precode  self.watchModel  function model, callback      for var key in model        if model.hasOwnPropertykey ampamp ko.isObservablemodel[key]          self.subscribeToPropertymodel, key, function key, val            callbackmodel, key, val                            self.subscribeToProperty  function model, key, callback      model[key].subscribefunction val        callbackkey, val         codepre  pwith the model looking something similar to the followingp  precodevar obsEmployee       Id employee.Id,     Name ko.observableemployee.Name,     Email ko.observableemployee.Email,     Salary ko.observableemployee.Salary,    codepre  pIm sure that theres either an equivalent method available in Angular, or the difference in implementation is significant enough that there is another approach.p

Negative 28135 pIm upgrading our application from 4.1 to 6.1.1 entity framework.  Ive been going in stages. Firstly upgrading the framework which was successful.

Ive reverse engineered the edmx using the entity framework power tools as a starting point.

Ive checked and rechecked the solution against the documentation and cannot get the convention to creating this fk property or force the fluent api to create it using .WillCascadeOnDeletetruep  pI had to move to the 6.1.2 beta2 build because of a bug in 6.1.1 with TPC model which was giving DbContext validation error using multiple levels of inheritance in our entity model.p  pWorst case Ill schema compare against the two db models and script out the FKs for a patch in deployment. edit I attempted this but EF6 gives an error about not having cascade deletes defined.p  pCan I get some suggestions to try to work around and get the db model FKs deployed Question is this bug in EF p

Negative 28135 pI have a Java EE application running on Wildfly 8 in which I want to enable audit logging. Using an InterceptorBinding and Interceptor I am able to catch all relevant API calls.p  pWhat I want to do is to write these audit calls to a separate audit log file. I tried implementing this using logback, and with the help of the second answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21846329overridelogginginwildfly2634222626342226this stackoverflow questiona I finally managed to do this. The first reply, i.e. disabling the system logging, did not work. However, while this solution successfully writes my audit trace to a separate file, all other logging stopped being written to their default files and was only output into the console.p  pWhat I want to achieve is to have all regular logging written to the regular file i.e. server.log as it is by default, but to have my own custom audit log messages in a separate file also rolling on a daily basis, renaming the old file to the date it was written.p  pWhether this is done with Logback, log4j, Wildflys own logging system or even the Wildfly CLI audit log, is irrelevant as long as it achieves the purpose, with minimal overhead. I am at this stage considering writing it into my own file with a simple outputstream, but that feels rather superfluous when there are solutions that should do this much more efficiently.p  pThis is what my logback file looks likep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltconfigurationgt     ltappender nameAUDITFILE classch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppendergt         ltfilegtApplicationswildflystandaloneloglogbackauditaudit.logltfilegt         ltrollingPolicy classch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicygt             ltFileNamePatterngtlogFile.dyyyyMMdd.logltFileNamePatterngt         ltrollingPolicygt         ltencodergt             ltpatterngtdHHmmss.SSS  msgnltpatterngt         ltencodergt     ltappendergt     ltappender nameFILE classch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppendergt         ltFilegtApplicationswildflystandaloneloglogbackserver.logltFilegt         ltrollingPolicy classch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicygt             ltFileNamePatterngtlogFile.dyyyyMMdd.logltFileNamePatterngt         ltrollingPolicygt         ltencodergt             ltPatterngtdHHmmss.SSS 4relative [thread] 5level logger35  msgnltPatterngt         ltencodergt     ltappendergt     ltlogger nameaudit levelINFO additivityfalsegt         ltappenderref refAUDITFILEgt     ltloggergt     ltlogger nameorg.jboss.resteasy.core.ExceptionHandler levelALLgt         ltappenderref refFILE gt     ltloggergt     ltroot levelALLgt         ltappenderref refFILEgt     ltrootgt ltconfigurationgt codepre

Negative 28135 pI have two ASP.NET applications running on the same server and sharing the same database. One is the frontend, developed with MVC, that caches data to avoid database calls to retrieve the same objects. The other is the backend, developed with WebForms, that is used to manage CRUD operations.p  pId like to invalidate the frontend cache when a backend operation occur. I dont need a refined mechanism... backend will be used only sporadically and could invalidate ALL cached objects.p  pIve come across some solutions, but theyre not very clean solutions... like, putting a flag on a db settings table, using a shared configuration file, calling a frontend web service from the backend application. Every solution needs to be applied every time a frontend page is called, so I need it to be less resource consuming as possibile.p  pI dont want to use memcached or AppFabric or similar cause I think theyre overkill for my basic needs.p  pThank you very muchp
Negative 28135 pIm making a 2D tower defense game for learning purposes, and cant make the enemiessprites to face the correct direction when moving. p  pHeres how the map is built for clarificationp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comivO8kWe.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comivO8kWe.pngap  pAnd here is the sprite sheet Im using to testp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.com2h4fSL3.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.com2h4fSL3.pngap  pThe first sprite at the top left is the frame 0, the next on the right is the frame 1 and so on. As you can see the sprite is already looking to the wrong direction. The map have a start pointthe first brown tile on the top and and end pointthe last brown tile in the end, and only the brown tiles are walkable, so with the start point and an end point it will calculate the shortest valid path for the sprites to walk in order to reach the end point.p  pSaid that, every sprite that spawn will have a pre determined path to walk, from that i try to find the direction the sprite is facing by checking the last X or Y position and the X or Y current position, with that i choose which line of the sprite sheet i will use for the walk animation. For example, lets say the sprite is moving south, it should use the sprites at the bottom of the sprite sheetframes 15 to 19, but its not working.p  pThis is the animation class Im using for the enemiesp  precode public class AnimatedSprite  Sprite              public int Lines  get set          public int Columns  get set          protected int currentFrame         protected int totalFrames         protected int timeSinceLastFrame  0         protected int milisecondsPerFrame  50           public AnimatedSpriteTexture2D texture, int lines, int columns, Vector2 position              base  texture, position                      this.texture  texture             this.position  position             Lines  lines             Columns  columns             totalFrames  Lines  Columns                   public override void UpdateGameTime gameTime                      base.UpdategameTime             Here i check if the sprite sheet have more than 1 line because if it have,             it must use a different update method.             if Lines gt 1                               Down                 if lastPostion.Y lt position.Y                                      AnimateDowngameTime                                   Up                 if position.Y lt lastPosition.Y                                      AnimateUpgameTime                                    Right                 if position.X gt lastPosition.X                                      AnimateRightgameTime                                    Left                 if position.X lt lastPosition.X                                      AnimateLeftgameTime                                            if Lines  1              timeSinceLastFrame  gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds             if timeSinceLastFrame gt milisecondsPerFrame                              timeSinceLastFrame  milisecondsPerFrame                 currentFrame                 if currentFrame  totalFrames                                      currentFrame  0                                                                           center  new Vector2position.X  texture.Width  Columns, position.Y  texture.Height  Lines                   public void AnimateUpGameTime gameTime                      timeSinceLastFrame  gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds             if timeSinceLastFrame gt milisecondsPerFrame                              timeSinceLastFrame  milisecondsPerFrame                 currentFrame                 if currentFrame gt 14                     currentFrame  10                                public void AnimateDownGameTime gameTime                      timeSinceLastFrame  gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds             if timeSinceLastFrame gt milisecondsPerFrame                              timeSinceLastFrame  milisecondsPerFrame                 currentFrame                 if currentFrame gt 19                     currentFrame  15                                           public void AnimateLeftGameTime gameTime                      timeSinceLastFrame  gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds                 if timeSinceLastFrame gt milisecondsPerFrame                              timeSinceLastFrame  milisecondsPerFrame                 currentFrame                 if currentFrame gt 4                     currentFrame  0                             public void AnimateRightGameTime gameTime                      timeSinceLastFrame  gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds                 if timeSinceLastFrame gt milisecondsPerFrame                              timeSinceLastFrame  milisecondsPerFrame                 currentFrame                 if currentFrame gt 9                     currentFrame  5                                 public override void DrawSpriteBatch spriteBatch                      int width  texture.Width  Columns             int height  texture.Height  Lines             int line  intfloatcurrentFrame  floatColumns             int column  currentFrame  Columns              Rectangle originRectangle  new Rectanglewidth  column, height  line, width, height             Rectangle destinationRectangle  new Rectangleintposition.X, intposition.Y, width, height                        spriteBatch.Drawtexture, destinationRectangle, originRectangle, Color.White                codepre  pEdit I made a test in a straight line levelstart point at left, it starts facing left frame 0, but when it reaches the third brown tile, it fixes and face the correct directionp  pi.imgur.com3FsGhuY.pngp  pEdit2 I made a test with straight line levels in all four directionsstarting down and going up, start right and going left and vice versa, and in all of them, it starts at frame 0 and when it reaches the third tile it fixes and face the correct direction.p

Negative 28135 pIve been writing a Swing program that uses a setup GUI. It makes the user select options and put information into the fields.

There are a emlotem more initialization things here.p  pMy question is, should I continue to just have the EDT or a worker thread set up these options as they are all just setting variables, or would it be better practice just to have public methods that get the current value of the items, then set the variables on my main threadp  precodepublic boolean isJCBDoSomethingSelected    return JCBDoSomething.isSelected  public String getJTFNameText    return JTFName.getText  Aaaaand more stuff codepre  pI understand the EDT.

Negative 28135 pI am using a Telerik MVC grid that house a list of objects bound to it. One of the standard calls, at least from the code that Ive been cribbing from in the project, is to call codeTryUpdateModelcode on the changed item as followsp  precodeResourceStatusGridUpdateint Id, int resourceId    UnitOfWork uow  new UnitOfWork   ResourceRepository rep  new ResourceRepositoryuow   ResourceStatus item  rep.GetStatusresourceId, true.FirstOrDefaulto gt o.Id  Id    if item  null ampamp TryUpdateModelitem        item.ResourceId  item.ResourceId     item.Type  item.TypeDropdown     item.AlertExpires  item.AlertExpiresPicker     item.AlertSet  item.DateTimePicker.HasValue  item.DateTimePicker.Value  item.AlertSet      rep.SaveStatusitem     codepre  pAs best I understand, that attempts to reconcile the state of the controls inside the grid that have been edited with the datamodel. For example, the item.TypeDropDown is codenullcode until the call. This has worked wonderfully until now. codeTryUpdateModelcode is returning false and I dont know why, or where to look for that information.p  hr  pI figured out that I had a bad data value, specifically a required value that was not filled in. Still, it would have been nice to have been able to have the system say somewhere Hey, this didnt pass because you forgot this required value, so I will leave my question up.p

Negative 28135 pI am currently using Crashlytics in my app and its working well. However, we are thinking of using NewRelic on the backend to better be able to pinpoint issues in our platform.

Negative 28135 pI have setup Shibboleth as an IdP, using its default credentials the certificates bundled with the installer.

Negative 28135 pAfter some fantastic suggestions, and a sleepless night of excitement due to the possibility of finally having a solution to my problem, I realize that Im still not quite at a solution. So, I am here to outline my problem in much more detail in hope that someone knows of the best way to achieve this.p  pTo recap if you havent read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28482648howtostoreobjectbaseddatainadatabasesoitremainsqueryablethe previous postap  ul liI am constructing a PHP OOP framework from scratch I have no choice in this matterli liThe framework is required to handle objectoriented data in the most efficient way possible.

This post is going to be long sorry.p  hr  pTo get started, I need to discuss a terminology that I had to introduce to solve one of the most crucial problems that came with the set of requirements. Ive named this terminology strongpersistencestrong. I understand that this term does have a different meaning when dealing with object databases, and for this reason I am open to suggestions on a different term. But for now, lets move on.p  pstrongPersistencestrongp  pPersistence refers to the independence of an object. I found the need to introduce this terminology when considering the data structure being generated from XML which is something that I had to be able to do. In XML, we see objects that are completely dependent on their parent, while we also see objects that can be independent of a parent object.p  pThe below example is an example of an XML document, that conforms to a certain structure for example, a .wsdl file. Each object resembles a type with a strict structure. strongEvery object has an id propertystrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8deQE.jpg altdata example xmlp  pIn the above example, we see two users. Both have their own Address objects under their address property. However if we look at their favouriteBook property, we can see that they both strongreusestrong the same Book object instance. Also note that the books use the same author.p  pSo we have the Address object which is strongnonpersistentstrong because it is only related to its parent object the User meaning that its instance only needs to exist while the owning User object exists. Then the Book object which is strongpersistentstrong because it can be used in multiple locations and its instance remains persistent.p  pAt first, I felt a bit crazy for coming up with a terminology like this, however, I found it remarkably simple to understand and use practically. It ultimately condenses the the manytomany, onetomany, onetoone, manytoone formula into a simple idea that I felt worked much better with nested data.p  pIve made an image representation of the above data herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtEVa8.jpg altData connections diagramp  pWith my definition of persistence, comes a set of rules to help in understanding it. These rules are as followsp  ul listrongupdatecreatestrongli liPersistent child objects of the base object being stored strongupdatestrong the properties of the persistent object, ultimately updating its instance.li liNonpersistent objects strongalwaysstrong create a new instance of the object to ensure that they always use a nonpersistent instance no two nonpersistent instances exist in more than one place at any given timeli listrongdeletingstrongli liPersistent child objects of the base object do not get deleted recursively. This is because the persistent object may exist in other places. You would always delete a persistent object directly.li liNonpersistent child objects of the base object are removed along with the base object. If they were not removed, they would be left stranded as their design requires that the have a parent.li listrongretrievingstrongli liSince persistent mostly defines how modifications work, retrieval doesnt involve persistence a great deal, aside from how you would expect persistence to effect how a model is stored and therefore how it would be retrieved persistent object instances remaining persistent wherever it is located, nonpersistent objects always having their own instanceli ul  pOne final thing to note before we move on  the persistence of data models is defined by the model itself strongrather than the relationshipstrong. Initially, the persistence was part of the relationship but this was completely unnecessary when the system expects that you know the structure of your models, and how they are used. Ultimately, every model instance of a model is either persistent, or it is not.p  hr  pSo taking a look at some code now, you might start to see the method behind the madness. Although it may seem that the reason for this solution is to be able to build a storage system around objective data conforming to set of conditions, its design actually comes from wanting to be able to store class instances, andor generate class instances from an objective data structure.p  pI have written some pseudoclasses as an example of the functionality that I am trying to produce. I have commented most methods, including type declarations.p  pSo first, this would be the base class that all model classes would extend. The purpose of this class is to create a layer between the model classobject, and the databasestorage enginep  precodeltphp    This is the base class that all models would extend. It contains the functionalities that are useful among all model   objects, such as crud actions, finding, and crud event management.     author Donny Sutherland ltdonnypixelpug.co.ukgt   package Main   subpackage Sub     Class ORMModel   class ORMModel             In order to generate relationships between objects, every object MUST have an id. This functions as the objects       unique identifier. Each object in its model type collection has its own id.             var int           public id            Internal property assigned by the application. This is where the persistence of the model is defined.             var bool           protected internalisPersistent  true            Internal property assigned by the application. This is an array of the models properties, and their PHP type.             For example, a User model might use something like this       array         id gt integer,        username gt string,        password gt string,        address gt object,        favouriteBook gt object,        allBooks gt array                    var array           protected internalpropertyTypes  array            Internal property assigned by the application. This is an array of the models properties which are objects, and       the MODEL CLASS type of the object.             For example, the User model example for the property types might use this       array        address gt Address,         favouriteBook gt Book,        allBooks gt Book                    var array           protected internalobjectTypes  array            I am not 100 sure on the best way to use this yet, I have tried a few different ways and all seem to cause       performance problems. But ultimately, before we attempt to update an object, we cache its currently stored       instance to this property, allowing us to compare old vs new. I find this really useful for detecting whether a       property has changed, I just need to work out the best way to do it.             var this           protected internalold             The lazy way to construct an empty model object all NULL values             return this           final public static function constructEmpty                    This method is used by the other constructFromXXX methods once the data has been converted to a PHP array.       This method is what allows us to build a RESTful interface into the ORM system as it conforms to the following       rules              if the id is set not null, first pull the object from storage.        For each key gt value of the passed array, OVERWRITE the value        For properties that are model objectsarrays, if the property is assiged to the array         if the array value is NULL, we are clearing the object relationship         if the array valus is not null, construct recursively at this point             Ultimately, if you assign a property in the array that you pass to this method, it will overwrite the value. If       you do not, it will use the property value in storage.             param array array             return this           final public static function constructFromArrayarray array                    This method attempts to decode the value of json into a PHP array.

The internal properties are properties that exist only in the classes not in storage. These properties get populated by the framework itself while you use an interface to create models, and add propertyfields to the models.p  pThe idea is, the framework comes with an interface for managing data models. With this interface you create the models, and add propertyfields to the models. In doing so, the system automatically creates the class files for you, updating those internal properties as you modify the persistence and property types.p  pTo keep things developer friendly, the system creates two class files for each model. A base class which extends ORMModel and another class which extends the base class. The base class is manipulated by the system and therefore modifying this file is not recommended. The other class is used by developers to add additional functionality to models and crud events.p  pSo coming back to the example data, here is the User base classp  precode    ltphp class UserBase extends ORMModel      public name     public pass            var Address           public address            var Book           public favouriteBook      protected internalisPersistent  true     protected internalpropertyTypes  array         id gt integer,         name gt string,         pass gt string,         address gt object,         favouriteBook gt object          protected internalobjectTypes  array         address gt Address,         favouriteBook gt Book       codepre  pPretty much self explanatory. Again note that the internal properties get generated by the system, so those arrays would be generated based on the propertyfields that you specify when creatingmodifying the User model in the model management interface. Also note the docblock on the address and codefavouriteBookcode property definitions. Those are also generated by the system making the classes very IDE friendly.p  pThis would be the other class generated for the User modelp  precode    ltphp final class User extends UserBase      public function beforeCreate             public function afterCreate             public function beforeUpdate             public function afterUpdate             public function beforeRemove             public function afterRemove             public function beforeRetrieve             public function afterRetrieve         codepre  pAgain, pretty self explanatory. Weve extended the base class to create another class where developers would add additional methods, and add functionality to the crud events.p  pIll not add in the other objects that make up the rest of the example data. Since the above should explain how they would look.p  pSo you maymay not have noticed that in the ORMModel class, the CRUD methods require an instance of an ORMCrudOptions class. This class is pretty crucial to the whole system, so lets take a quick look at thatp  precode    ltphp     Despite this object being somewhat aggregate, it it quite possibly the most important part of the ORM, in that it   defines how CRUD actions are executed, and outline how the querying is done.     Class ORMCrudOptions   final class ORMCrudOptions             This ultimately makes up the where part of the sql query. However, because we want to be able to make querying       possible at any depth within the hierarchy of a model, this gets quite complicated.             Previously, I developed a system which allowed the user to do something like this             this.customer.address.postcode LIKE XXX OR this.customer.address.line1 LIKE XXX             he this and the . are my extension to basic sql. The this refers to the base model that you are finding,       and each . basically drills down into the hierarchy to make a comparison on a property somewhere within a       contained model object.             I will explain more how I did this in my post, I am most definitely looking at how I could better achieve this       though.             var string           private query            This allows you to build up a list of order by definitions.             Using the orderBy method, you can chain up the order by statements like             gtorderBythis.name,ascgtorderBythis.customer.address.line1,desc             Which would be similar to doing             ORDER BY thisname ASC, thiscustomeraddress.line1 DESC             var array           private orderBy            This allows you to set the limit start and limit values by doing             gtlimit10,10             Which would be similar to doing             LIMIT 10, 10             var           private limit            Depth was added in my later en devours to try and help with performance. It allows you to specify the depth at       which to retrieve data. Although this helped with optimisation a lot, I really disliked having to use       implement this because it seems like a workaround. I would rather be able to increase performance elsewhere so       that objects are always retrieved at their full depth             var integer           private depth            This was another newly added feature. Whenever you execute a crud action on a model, the model instance is stored       in a local cache if this is true, andor retrieved from this cached if this value is true.             I did find this to make a significant increase on performance, although it did bring in complications that make       the system tricky to use at times. You really need to understand how and when to use the cache, otherwise it can       be infuriatingly obtuse.             var bool           private useCache            Built into the ORM system, and tied in with the application I set up a webhook system which fires out webhooks on       crud events. I discovered the need to be able to disable webhooks at times when doing large amounts of crud       actions in one go pretty early on. Setting this to false basically disables webhooks on the crud action             var bool           private fireWebhooks            Also build into the application, and tied into the ORM system is an access system. This works on a seperate       layer to the database, allowing me to use the same access system as I use for everything in the framework as I do       for defining crud action access. However, in some instances I found it useful to disable access checks.             This is always on by default. In the api system that I built to access the data models, you were not able to       modify this property and therefore were always subject to access checks.             var           private ignoreAccessChecks             The lazy way to create a new instance of options.             return ORMCrudOptions           public static function n          return new ORMCrudOptions                  Set the query value             param query             return this           public function queryquery          thisgtquery  query          return this                  Add an orderby field and direction             param field       param string direction             return this       internal param array orderBy                 public function orderByfield,directionasc          thisgtorderBy[]  arrayfield,direction          return this                  Set the limit start and limit.             param limitResults       param null limitStart             return this           public function limitlimitResults,limitStartnull          thisgtlimit  arraylimitResults,limitStart          return this                  Set the depth for retrieval             param depth             return this           public function depthdepth          thisgtdepth  depth          return this                  Set whether to use the model cache             param useCache             return this           public function useCacheuseCache          thisgtuseCache  useCache          return this                  Set whether to fire webhooks on crud actions             param fireWebhooks             return this           public function fireWebhooksfireWebhooks          thisgtfireWebhooks  fireWebhooks          return this                  Set whether to ignore access checks             param ignoreAccessChecks             return this           public function ignoreAccessChecksignoreAccessChecks          thisgtignoreAccessChecks  ignoreAccessChecks          return this       codepre  pThe idea behind this class is to remove the need to have a large number of arguments in the crud methods, and because the majority of those arguments can be reused in all of the crud methods. Take note of the comments on the query property, as that is one is important.p  hr  pSo, that pretty much covers the base psuedocode and ideas behind what it is that I am trying to do. So finally, Ill show some userscenariosp  precodeltphp the most simple way to store a user user  UserconstructEmpty we use auto incrementing on the id value at the database end. So by not specifying the id, we are not updaing, and the id will be auto generated. After the push has been made, the system will assign the id for me usergtname  bob usergtpass  bobpass the system automatically constructs child objects for you if they are not yet constructed, because it knows what type should be constructed. So I dont need to construct the address object, manually usergtaddressgtline1  awesome drive usergtaddressgtzip  90051 save to storage, but dont fire webhooks and ignore access checks. Note that the ORMCrudOptions object is passed to child objects too when recursion happens, meaning that the same options are inherited by child objects usergtpushThisORMCrudOptionsngtfireWebhooksfalsegtignoreAccessCheckstrue echo usergtid this will display the auto generated id echo usergtaddressgtid this will be the audo generated id of the address object.  next lets update something within the object usergtname  bob updated because we know now that the object has an id value, it will update the existing object. Remembering tha the User object is persistent usergtpushThisORMCrudOptionsngtfireWebhooksfalsegtignoreAccessCheckstrue echo usergtid this will be the exact same id as before echo usergtaddressgtid this will be a NEW ID Remember, the address object is NOT persistent meaning that a new instance was created in order to ensure that is is infact nonpersistent. The system does handle cleaning up of loose objects although this is one of the main perforance problems  finding the above object by usergtname user  UserfindOneORMCrudOptionsngtquerythis.name  bob ifuser      echo usergtname provided that a user with name bob exsists, this would output bob   finding the above user by addressgtzip user  UserfindOneORMCrudOptionsngtquerythis.address.zip  90051 ifuser      echo usergtaddressgtzip provided that the user with addressgtzip 90051 exists, this would output 90051   removing the above user user  UserfindById1 assuming that the id of the user id 1 add a favourite book to the user usergtfavouriteBookgtname  awesome book update usergtpushThisORMCrudOptionsngtignoreAccessCheckstrue remove usergtremoveThisORMCrudOptionsngtignoreAccessCheckstrue with how persistence works, this will delete the user, and the users address because the address is nonpersistence but will leave the created book undeleted, because books are persistent and may exist as child objects to other objects  finally, constructing from documentoriented user  UserconstructFromArrayarray     user gt bob,     pass gt passbob,     address gt array         line1 gt awesome drive,         zip gt 90051       this will only CONSTRUCT the object based on the internal properties defined property types and object types. properties that dont exist in the models defined properties, but exist in the array will be ignored, so having more properties in the array than should be there doesnt matter usergtpushThisORMCrudOptionsngtignoreAccessCheckstrue  update only one property of a user object using arrays this is ultimately how the api system of the ORM was built user  UserconstructFromArrayarray     id gt 1,     user gt bob updated  echo usergtpass this would output passbob, because the pass was not specified in the array, it was pulled form storage codepre  pIts not really possible to show here, but one of the things that makes this system a delight to use is how the the generation of the class files makes them incredibly IDE friendly in particular, for autocompletion. Yeah, some of the oldschool developers will be against this newmodernfangledtechnology, but at the end of the day when you are dealing with crazily complex objectoriented data structures, having the IDE help you in spelling your property names correctly and getting the structure correct can be a lifesaverp  pIf you are still with me, thank you for reading. You are probably wondering though, emwhat is it you want againem. p  pIn short, I dont have a huge amount of experience in documentobject storage and already in the past few days Ive been shown that there are technologies out there that could help my achieve what it is that I am trying to do. Im just not 100 certain yet that I have found the right one. Do I create a new ORM, can I efficiently get this functionality out of an existing ORM, do I use a dedicated objectgraph databasep  pI very much welcome any and all suggestionsp

Negative 28135 pDoes the Datapower Secure Connection in Bluemix require the Datapower to be internet facing  If Bluemix starts the connection, the answer is maybe yes. But as the Basic Secure Connection Software, if that one initiates the connection, the server running the Basic Secure Connection only needs to have internet access behind a firewallgatewayetc..., but doesnt need to be internet facing  IP on internet.p

Negative 28135 pIm having a weird problem with timers. As long as I know, the interval property of a timer indicates the delay between loops in which the timerTick event will be fired.p  pI had this problem with the exact signature 15 and 16 milliseconds delay before while programming in Visual Basic. Any timers that I create, fire their tick event with 15 or 16 milliseconds delay. For instance, if I set the interval of my timer to 1 which means its tick event should get fired 1000 times in 1 second, the event instead gets fired 62 to 66 times in 1 second thats 100016 to 100015.p  pIve been developing VB applications since 5 years ago and always had this problem that also means I had this problem on several different systems with both AMD and Intel processors, and now Im having it again with C.p  pId managed to do a workaround and solve this problem by calculating the time difference between each time the tick event gets fired based on TickCount method GetTickCount API in VB and Environment.TickCount in C.p  pTickCount is the amount of milliseconds passed since the time system had started.p  pTo understand the problem better, I created a windows application that counts the seconds since it gets executed like a timer. It relies on both TickCount and ordinary addition on each time the Tick event gets fired. It also calculates the delay of the timer by subtracting the last value of TickCount from the current value of the TickCount if the timer would have been fired 1000 times in 1 second truly, then the difference of the TickCounts would be 1 each time, thus meaning theres no delay, but if the difference is more than 1, then there is some delay between each times the timers tick event gets fired.p  pHeres the codep  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form      int localTime  0, systemTime  0, baseSystemTime  0, lastSystemTime  0     public Form1              InitializeComponent           private void timer1Tickobject sender, EventArgs e               Calculate time based on TickCount         if baseSystemTime  0             baseSystemTime  Environment.TickCount          systemTime  Environment.TickCount  baseSystemTime         label2.Text System Time   systemTime  1000  60.ToString    systemTime  1000  60.ToString           Calculate time based on timer1Tick         localTime         label1.Text  Application Time   localTime  1000  60.ToString    localTime  1000  60.ToString           Calculate the delay         if lastSystemTime gt 0                      label3.Text  Delay   Environment.TickCount  lastSystemTime.ToString   ms                   lastSystemTime  Environment.TickCount       codepre  pIve also uploaded the whole solution here a hrefhttpramt.intestTimerDelay.zip relnofollowhttpramt.intestTimerDelay.zipap  pHeres a screenshot of the application with 15 milliseconds delay and 1 second counted by application while 17 seconds have actually passedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYbYEo.jpg altScreen Shotp  pThe solution is only 50kb, so feel free to download it and run it to see if you get the same result as me.

I have the clicking part working, but I wanted to be able to make several clicks during execution, as if there is a quiz with multiple lists one after another.p  pOne option is to make a while loop with codegetchcode from codemsvcrtcode. The thing is after a click outside the cmd its window is no longer selected, but rather the window where the destination point is located. Therefore, the script stops being active and the user cannot choose another location. A workaround is to click the cmd window to return the focus to it and be able to do any more clicks. To solve this, it would be necessary to create a service or, according to Sanju, a thread.p  pThe other option is to use a keylogger such as PyHook, which seems like the way to go. However, the problem is that the window where I want to use it in, a webpage in flash or another animations engine, causes an error that some users have found using this keylogger for example in Skype and is being described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26156633pythoncomcrashesonkeydownwhenusedhookedtocertainapplicationsherea. In my case, it also happens with this webpage and either when the click is made on the window itself or when the key is pressed with the window selected.p  pMy base code is presented below, where codeclick...code would normally contain the coordinates as argument but they are being omitted for simplicity. In this case, 0 ends the program and there are three options being chosen with the numbers 13.p  precodeimport msvcrt, win32api, win32con  def clickx,y     win32api.SetCursorPosx,y     win32api.mouseeventwin32con.MOUSEEVENTFLEFTDOWN,x,y,0,0     win32api.mouseeventwin32con.MOUSEEVENTFLEFTUP,x,y,0,0  key0  while keyb0     keymsvcrt.getch      if keyb1         click...     elif keyb2         click...     elif keyb3         click... codepre  pThe attempts below try to implement Sanjus suggestion, first with the whole while inside the thread and then with the codequeuecode, both not working as expected...p  precodeimport threading, msvcrt, win32api, win32con  def MyThread     key0      while keyb0         keymsvcrt.getch          if keyb1             ...  def clickx,y     ...  threading.ThreadtargetMyThread,args[].start codepre  p.p  precodeimport queue, threading, msvcrt, win32api, win32con  def MyThreadkey     while key.getb0         key.putmsvcrt.getch          if key.getb1             ...  def clickx,y     ...  keyqueue.Queue key.put0  threading.ThreadtargetMyThread,args[key].start codepre  pThe other attempt uses PyHook, but its still facing the aforementioned issue.p  precodeimport pyHook, pythoncom, win32api, win32con  def OnKeyboardEventevent     if event.KeyNumpad1         ...  def clickx,y     ...  hmpyHook.HookManager hm.KeyDownOnKeyboardEvent hm.HookKeyboard  pythoncom.PumpMessages codepre

Inside it, it is going to have my JS app, which I will eventually be running through NodeJS. p  pWhat changes do I have to make to env.js, world.coffee and mystep definition to be able to test my code I am developing in libmyapp.coffee p  pThank youp
Negative 28135 pAs far as I know, only a single users identity may be specified with git config. I have a situation where Id like to have multiple identities for the same git repository, depending on the UNIX user.p  pThe repository is at varwww. When user jack makes a commit to it, the commit should automatically be jacks identity. When user jill makes a commit, jills identity should be used.p  pThe reason why I want to use the same repository is because its the content of a website, and Apache is looking in varwww. The contents are NOT userspecific, so using Apaches userdir feature is not an option here.p

Negative 28135 pFor those who remember or still use Windows XP, you might remember that you could launch the start bar with your Windows key on your keyboard and then hit the letter of the programfolderfile you wanted and as long as there wasnt another programfolderfile on the start bar starting with the same letter, itd launch right away. e.g. If you wanted to open excel, youd hit the windows key and press the letter e and excel would launch.p  pSo, for those who do remember that feature, Im wondering, is there any way to get that functionality back in Windows 8.1 Right now, what happens is that when you hit the windows key, Metro pops up which is fine but if you type e, for example, windows will automatically start searching instead of just launching Excel or whatever letter youve typed.p  pId rather keep the interface as it is and, if possible, prefer not to install any 3rd party software unless theres no other go. My preference is to be able to utilize the OS to get that option if available, even if that includes going through regedit. p  pJust a note, I am already aware that 8.1 and XP are completely different architectures and I also realize that automatic searching does have its benefits but I prefer that specific XP functionality so itd be great if I could get it back in 8.1.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  hr

Negative 28135 pI thought about this ever since reading this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq91903522007884Abusing the algebra of algebraic data types  why does this workap  hr  pCan the following ideas be made rigorousbr These are my base typesp  ul liProduct codecodeli liConstraint codecodeli liUnion codecodeli liDeletion codecodeli liSingleton codeXcodeli liUnit code1codeli liFunction codecode where codeagtbcode codebacodeli ul  pWith this expanded set I can suddenly define a whole lot more functions.br For instance, I could take a pair of types code236code but then I decide to give one of the two types, say code2code, a specific, fixed value, while leaving the other half generic code623code  Before, I had six possible values. Now, after having constrained one of my types, my choices are down to 3.p  pSimilarly, say I have a type of five values code5code but then I figure out that two of them are irrelevant.br I can safely delete them code523code and am left with three possible values.p  pHere is what happens when you try to apply this to a function type codea gt bcode  codebacodebr Say I want to find a zipper for this. a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocdownloaddoi10.1.1.22.8611ampreprep1amptypepdf relnofollow titleThe Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of OneHole Contexts pdfAs per Conor McBridea, aAll that means is that I need to differentiate the corresponding type variable. In this case I get codeddb ba  aba1  ababcode which in this analogy equivalently means, if I vary codebcode, I need to remember what value codeacode that codebcode came from and then have to construct a function from a type with one less element codea1code to codebcode, or I have to remember what value codeacode that codebcode came from, I can then construct the same function codebacode, but I need to apply a constraint of type codebcode.br Note that this really is equivalent to demanding that codeagtbcode is surjective. My codeacode can be mapped to a new codebcode, any codebcode in fact, but you cannot map a single codeacode to multiple codebcode, so if you want to change a codebcode corresponding to a specific codea0code in codeacode you need to remember codea0code and it has to be removed from the type so you dont reuse it anywhere else.p  pNow lets see what happens if I want to vary codeacode instead codedda ba  balogbcodebr Ok, that looks tougher. Lets see what codelogxcode expands to. Uh oh It does not have an expansion around codex0code. Instead, the nicest expansion happens around codex1code. To avoid having to write that all the time, Ill instead look at codeMaybe xcodecodex1codebr codelogx1xx22x33...codebr So that poses a bit of a problem. Now you could split this up into codelogcode and codelogcode like sobr codelogx1xx33x55...codebr codelogx1x22x44x66...codebr codelogx1logx1logx1codebr In which case all that codelogx1code says is that you can have an codexcode or a triple codex,x,xcode with a constraint of type code3code or a 5tuple with a constraint of type code5code or...br And codelogx1code says the same for even numbers. But then, codelogx1code says that I can have any element codex2n12n1code but I also have to remove something of the form codex2n2ncode. where my codencode is anything larger than code0code  this also means that Im not forced to manipulate code0code here in any way, as I shouldnt be. Any combination of the two seems like it should work.p  pSo lets see if we can make sense of that codedda ba  balogbcode or, to make it simpler, lets pass a codeMaybe bcode insteadbr codedda b1a  b1alogb1codebr So if I want to change my codeacode, I get a pair of a function of the same type codeagtMaybe bcode and a list of constraints codelog Maybe bcode. This list must also keep surjectivity intact.br So lets say I have two values codea1 gt b1code, codea2 gt b2code.br Now if simply replace codea1code with codea2code, Ill immediately violate surjectivitybr codea2 gt b1code, codea2 gt b2code and codea1 gt Nothingcode. Thus, this change has a rippleon effect and I have to delete either codea2 gt b1code or codea2 gt b2code. This, if Im not mistaken, would then be stored in the list of constraints as something like codeb1b1,b22code but Im not entirely sure yet. Higher order terms, I think, would then correspond to values codebcode that come from multiple codeacode, to keep remembering which codeacode we are talking about.p  pLets look at one more example codeex  1xx22x36...codebr This type would essentially be a constrained list. It would contain codeNothingcode or an codexcode or a pair codex,xcode with half the values fixed by the other half, or a triple codex,x,xcode with two thirds of the values fixed by the last third, or...br Furthermore it should have the curious properties that it is isomorphic to its own zipper codeddx ex  excode and that it is the inverse of codelogcode so codelog ex  xcode.p  pAnd finally edge cases. For example, what about the type codex0code  first of all, what about a constraint that is between code0code and code1code If you do that, youll find that, for instance, codex12code  code2xcode  codexxcode so a constraint in that range will essentially become a choice or the removal of a constraint, i.e. constraining a constraint is equivalent to adding more possible values to your type. Now codex0code is essentially saying take an x and have it be constrained by nothing at all which would be equivalent to saying that anything at all goes, which is essentially emex falso sequitur quodlibetem, constraint edition.  Similarly, of course, codexx0code means that if you remove all possible values of a type, you cant return anything anymore, and codexx1code means that if you constrain your type by itself, youll end up with just a single possible value.p  pLess clear is what happens with codexy, ygtxcode. But while having such a negative type in the final result of a program would be weird, given the rough sketch above, it probably still would be valid in the middle of a program. It would simply specify how many values have to be removed from a type that might occur later down the line.p  pIm also unsure about the exact meaning of, say, a type codeabcode where codeacode and codebcode are mutually prime. In the above examples of codelogcode and codeexcode I think that it might not be a problem simply because you have an infinite list of possible values to choose from. codeEithercode, i.e. a sumtype, just says pick one of those. Only one term must actually exist. Not sure if it always would.  But Im not solid about what such terms would mean standalone. In any case it should somehow correspond to collapsing a good number of values in a given type into one.p  pSo to conclude, I dont fully understand these operations yet, but it looks very much like it might actually work out just fine. How far is too far Can this still work out or does one run into problems I.e. are the last two paragraphs above not resolvable If it works, are there implementations of something like this yetp

Negative 28135 pHello there and in advance, thanks a lot for your time.p  pI am in the middle of building my portfolio and require for that some help with the more technical aspect within.p  pWhat I would like to dop  pI would like to let my user ask questions by clicking a chain of divs, depending on each div clicked, possible options connected to that div will then highlight and when the question has been asked, a answer depending on the specific chain would then appear what type of answer is not important. So if I have 5 divsp  precodeltdiv classwhatgtWhatltdivgt ltdiv classwouldgtWouldltdivgt ltdiv classlikegtLikeltdivgt ltdiv classyougtYoultdivgt ltdiv classigtIltdivgt codepre  pAnd my user clicks on the strongWhatstrong div, the strongWouldstrong div would highlight add a class, if then clicked, the strongYoustrong and strongIstrong divs would highlight and so forth. This would enable my user to ask a question based on the original worddiv clicked and which words I then have chosen to connect to that worddiv.p  pI would then like to be able to use the specific string of words to fun a function, append a class or such. So that the question strongWhatstrong, strongWouldstrong, strongYoustrong and strongLikestrong would, as an example show a choice of 3 sentences to choose from, but the question of strongWhatstrong, strongWouldstrong, strongIstrong and strongLikestrong would, as an example show a picture of a hotdog or some sort.p  pI do know a bit of Javascript, but a little more jQuery, so I would prefer to work in that language if possible. I know that the question is a little complex and that I have not included any code, but I really did not know how to go around this.p  pI appreciate any and all help and again would like to thank anyone who takes their time reading this and or answering.p
