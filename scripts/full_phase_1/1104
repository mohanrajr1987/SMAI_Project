Positive 1104 pI have a script working with Python 3.4 and Selenium. The end result is that it clicks on a button labeled CSV so that I can open and save the page search result as a csv file. When this is clicked it opens up the save as dialog in Chrome. I want to be able to change the file name and file location. I have a similar script working for other sites and those download to the default location downloads folder default action in Chrome with a leftclick. From there I rename the file and move it to a different folder on the PC via the script. p  pThis particular site though the button uses Flash to download the file. Im not familiar with the mechanics of how this works but there is no rightclick functionality or anything like that. The only option I have within the web page is to click and then at the save as dialog rename it and select a folder.p  pIm looking for a suggestion for a module or combination of modules I can use to do this. What it needs to be able to do is determine the current open dialog save as window and then change the name and set the folder to save to. Actually, even just being able to click the save button keeping the default name and location would be fine too. I could just rename and move it afterward. I did see win32 but Im not sure if thats the best option. Im on Windows 7.p  pEDIT 1012015p  pTried a few things and I can operate the save button in the save as dialog by sending a keyboard Return using keybdevent. p  precode    win32api.keybdeventwin32con.VKRETURN, 0  codepre  pProblem now is that the default save location is not my Downloads folder when I click the button.

This helps a lot and I no longer experience this issue unless the browser is executing in the background. If the browser is not in foreground, then I hit the overlay issue very frequently. While protractor is waiting based on my wait for angular override, if I bring the browser to foreground, then the test immediately begins continuing to execute and the dom state changes for the overlay.p  pWould love any thoughts from people with insight.p  pI assume the .isDisplayed not working properly seems to be a webdriver issue. And I also assume that the overlay being stuck in a specific dom state in the background to be an angular issue.p

Negative 1104 pI am trying to prevent data races in a multihreaded server. My problem is the following there is a codeListltRServergtcode, the type codeRServercode is a class with several fields. Now, the server has several threads all running at the same time and they can modify both the codeListcode adding more items and the individual codeRServercode instances changing the fields.p  pSo my strategy is to make a codereadonly object RServerLock  new object code in each of the codeRServercode instances and additionally a codereadonly object RServerListLock  new object code and enclose all the code that modifies either the codeListcode or a codeRServercode instance in a codelockcode. Is this safe What happens if a thread tries to lock a codeRServerLockcode emwhileem another one is locking itp

Negative 1104 pIm building a website to display products, and categories of products. The data comes from an external service in the form of a 500k XML file. The website is ASP.NET, C.p  pThe XML is structured as a list of categories. Inside each category might be some products andor some more categories.p  pObviously, we cannot call this external service to get the large XML file each page request, so we call it once every few hours and cache it. I need to do things like thisp  ul liDisplay a product category menu on the left hand side of the pageli liDisplay all products in a selected categoryli liDisplay extended information on a single productli ul  pMy questions are as followsp  pFirstly, on a page that displays all products in DVDs category, lets say I do the following on page loadp  precodeXDocument allCategories  Cache[CategoriesXml]  loop through the XML and find the DVD category  Get all products under it, then display them codepre  pBy bringing the categories XML into a local variable remember, its 500k, is that a drain on the server Remember, Im going to have to do this each time a page is loaded. There might be thousands of people looking at different pages at the same time. If a thousand people load the same page in the space of a few seconds, will I have a thousand instances of this XML file hanging around in memory Or will the garbage collector manage all of that for mep  pIs it better to loop directly over the cached item, or is that less performant andor bad practicep  pSecondly, I said I cache the whole XML file. I get products or categories from that XML by loopiing through it I use LINQ over XML. Would it be better to create a Category type and a Product type, put them into arrays, and cache that Then loop through Category objects and arrays rather than an XDocument What would be more performantp  pThirdly, what would you say is the best practice in terms of how to architect this system. Lets say I have a Data Access Layer, a Business Objects Layer, and the Web Application. Where should I put the reference to the external service, to retrieve the XML Which layer should I Cache it Does this application even have a Data Access layer, in the sense that the DAL part is done by some other system Currently my DAL is only there for accessing our database, and it feels wrong to put a webservice refernce in there  but maybe its not Is it bad practice to use caching in the Business layer i.e. interferes with unit tests, etc I have considered a middle layer between the web and the business layer, solely for caching  is this a good or bad ideap  pI have already finished the bulk of this website, actually  Im simply looking back at it now and wondering if I have done it the best way, so want to compare your suggestions with what I have actually done, and hopefully I will be able to go back and improve it.p  pThanksp

Negative 1104 pAll of this is on a windows xp boxp  pNetbeans managed to accept an existing rails project and allowed me to debug it just fine, but my project has a number of processing scripts that handle nonMVC aspects.  The rails project is just a system for queuing requests for the execution of these scripts.p  pIve attempted to create netbeans projects using existing sources, but it fails for a number of reasons.  p  pFirst, since I have a number of scripts in one place, netbeans complains that I cant add a source directory to the project because it already belongs to another project.  If I put the script into its own, empty, directory and try to add that directory, netbeans stalls while trying to create the project and I have to end the process from the task manager.p  pIf I create a new project for it, remove the default main.rb and replace it with the script I want to debug, the debug session will not start  netbeans complains that it cannnot find the program entry point.p  pIt seems to me that if I can debug rails apps as easily as netbeans allows me to, that running a single standalone script would be trivial.  What on earth am I missingp  pUPDATE Loading the script and doing DebugDebug File isnt possible.  The option is always greyed out, even for hello world.p

But I have never seen any cases where error information error codes, messages, etc gets passed back in this manner, so Im wondering if this might not be the best approach.p  pShould I just add any error data that I wish to pass back to my Custom eventargs class, are there good reasons for or against this or are there other, better ways to accomplish thisp  pHere is my eventargs classp  precodepublic delegate void ItemValidationEventHandlerobject sender, ItemValidationEventArgs e  public class ItemValidationEventArgs  CancelEventArgs      public ItemValidationEventArgsobject item, ObjectAction state, EventArgs e              Item  item         State  state         EventArgs  e           public ItemValidationEventArgsobject item, ObjectAction state  thisitem, state, new EventArgs                public ItemValidationEventArgs  thisnull, ObjectAction.None, new EventArgs                 is there a better way to pass this info     public string ErrorMessage get set     public int ErrorNumber getset      public object Item  get private set      public ObjectAction State  get private set       public EventArgs EventArgs  get private set   codepre  pUPDATE I suppose another other option would be to use something like thisp  precodevirtual bool Validateobject item, ObjectAction action, out string errorMessage codepre  pmethod in the derived classes.

Negative 1104 pI am trying to query the windows desktop search API using SQL.p  pI have to say I really HATE the windows 7 search GUI, and so I decided to write my own. I have a lot of files indexed approx 1.000.000, and I want to do a search for names. Something like Show me every name which contains bunny.p  pBut here i run into a performance problem. Searching forp  precodeSELECT System.ItemPathDisplay FROM SystemIndex WHERE System.FileName LIKE egon codepre  pis really fast. Also the egon alternative. But egon takes forever. I am not sure if it is in the nature of the index I understand that the possibilities increase enormously or if I am doing something wrong...p  pOk, now my actual question Is it correct that the windows index is only a big SQL database. If so, where can I find exact information about the structure of the DB primary keys, indexes. If I have that, its basically just optimizing SQL.p  pAlternative question Does anybody knows a fast SQL statement to find all files with egon somewhere in the name...p  pChrisp  p[Edit why I do not like the search GUI]p  pWell, its just not intuitive, compared to XP. If you disable the dog and use the old XP interface, I could create a search query like All files older than 1 month, bigger than 10 MB, name pattern STARhomeworkSTAR.docx  Try this in Windows 7 without learning the syntax. And hell, I do NOT want to learn another syntax just to find one file...p  pThe other main problem are maybe my search habits. Most of the time I somehow know the file name or parts and simply want the location. And if you use the search this way you ran into several problemp  ul liFirst of all, you always have to prefix it with nameli liThen the folder name layout is stupid it is ordering by parent folder, not full path, I THINK, because.. tada... see next pointli liThen, even more annyoing, if you have a list of results and you try to sort them, it takes forever...li ul  pAnd now I really think my system has a bug. I tried to quickly check it, searched in some average size folder for test and he found some files. Then I tried to sort them for folders to verify my second point and now he is just searching forever... I mean really, while I am typing he tries to find the word hello... oh, finished  he found approx 20 files. So, now, lets try something.... Ok, now it seems like he has recovered.. But still, to slow for my taste...p  pSo, enough cursing about search p

Negative 1104 pIm on an ASP.Net 2.0 project, in C. I have some data that gets stored in session state. For ease of use, it is wrapped in a property, like thisp  precodeprotected IListltStuffgt RelevantSessionData      get              return IListltStuffgt Session[relevantkey]          set              Session[relevantkey]  value       codepre  pGetting and setting the value works exactly as youd expect. If I want to clear the value, I just set it to null, and there are no problems. However, in another developers page, he calls the collections Clear method. I thought this would be a bug, but it seems to work, and I dont understand why. It works like sop  precodeDebug.WriteLineRelevantSessionData.Count    outputs, say, 3 RelevantSessionData.Clear Debug.WriteLineRelevantSessionData.Count    outputs 0 codepre  pWhy does this work My naive expectation would be that the middle line loads the serialized value from session, deserializes into an object, calls codeClearcode on that object, and then lets the unnamed object fall out of scope. That would be a bug, because the value stored in Session would remain unchanged. But apparently, its smart enough to instead call the property setter and serialize the newly changed collection back into session. p  pThis makes me a little nervous, because there are places in our legacy code where property setters have side effects, and I dont want those getting called if its not intended.p  pDoes the property setter always get called in a situation like this Is something else going on Or do I completely misunderstand whats happening herep  p[Added to explain answer]br It turns out did misunderstand. I knew that objects stored in Session must be serializable, and based on that I made too many assumptions about how the collection behaves internally. I was overthinking.p  pThere is only one instance of the stored object my codeIListcode. Each call to the getter returns a reference to that same instance. So the quoted code above works just as it appears, with no special magic required.p  pAnd to answer the title question No, setters are not called implicitly.p

Delphi XE has some new features.

The IDE is also not as stable and fast as Delphi 7 and the tool bar has real problems better dont customize the IDE. There is also a nasty bug where the IDE has 100 CPU utilization see my other posts about all these issues. I hope that in Update 2 and 3 they will fix some of the most stringent issues.p  pAnyway I think I upgraded too soon because now Embarcadero announced the 64 bit compiler so probably I will have to pay again a lot of money to upgrade to the next version of Delphi in order to get that compiler. For those that are still thinking to upgrade to Delphi XE I would recommend to trial Delphi XE before buying it to see if it offers indeed some features that are not available otherwise. I am not saying that Delphi XE is worst than Delphi 7, I am saying that it is not betterp

But recently we discovered that since we are using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusdevlabsee794896.aspxReactive Extensionsa, we actually emdoem have the codeConcurrentcode namespace available to us in System.Threading.dll.p  pNaturally, I figured that since a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd267312.aspxcodeBlockingCollectionltTgtcodea is one of the core classes in the codeConcurrentcode namespace, it would probably offer better performance than anything I or my teammates wrote.p  pSo I tried writing a new implementation that works very simplyp  precodepublic T Borrow      return blockingCollection.Take   public void ReturnT obj      blockingCollection.Addobj  codepre  pTo my surprise, according to some simple tests borrowingreturning to the pool a few thousand times from multiple threads, our original implementation strongsignificantly beats codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode in terms of performancestrong. They both appear to work emcorrectlyem its just that our original implementation seems to be much faster.p  pMy questionp  ol liWhy would this be Is it perhaps because codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode offers greater flexibility I understand it works by wrapping an codeIProducerConsumerCollectionltTgtcode, which necessarily introduces performance overheadli liIs this just a flatout misguided use of the codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode classli liIf this is an appropriate use of codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode, am I just not using properly For example, is the codeTakecodecodeAddcode approach overly simplistic, and theres a far betterperforming way to get the same functionalityli ol  pUnless anyone has some insight to offer in response to that third question, it looks like well be sticking with our original implementation for now.p

Negative 1104 pIve created an applet which has one large panel to display data surrounded by several controls buttons, textfields, etc.. The large panel contains several layers of labels which I render myself.p  pThe controls all have tooltips associated with them, and some of these tooltips overlap the main panel. When they disappear, they leave a hole in the main panel image until the main panel is repainted. p  pNow mind you, this does not always happen. It only occurs when the cursor is in a certain range. If you get far enough to either the left or right no difference noted for changes along the Y axis, the holes are painted over when the tooltip disappears.p  pIm not wellversed on how tooltips and repainting are supposed to work, and if this is a sign that theres something dreadfully wrong with my program, but if I can just call repaint on the main panel whenever the tooltip disappears, I should be fine. Is there something I can override in tooltip to make this happenp  pIm using Swingp  pThanks.p

Negative 1104 pMy application has a master database which has around 50 tables which are used as lookup tables and will provide data to fill the comboboxes and any other controls and also some application settings tables. So I was thinking of creating these master tables context and load the entities and add it to the application life time context object upon user login so that I can access them throughout the application when ever I need. However I am also thinking of a different approach where I download the dataseset of all the tables and save it to the isolated storage and read the tables from that dataset when ever I need to load the combobox. The dataset with all the tables loaded is around the size 1.2MB. I do not know which one should I follow and what will be the shortcomings of these approaches when compared to each other and also is there an elegant way of handling such a case. Can anyone please suggest me p  pThanks, Ajay.p

Negative 1104 pIn Xcode 3 I made a few build configurations, one being Ad Hoc, one being Distribution. In each of them I could put whatever settings I wanted so I could have some settings  or pre build scripts run only for the Ad Hoc or for the Distribution build. p  pIn Xcode 4 however we are stuck with Schemes, and there is only 1 Archive entry where you have to choose which build config it uses. So if I want to archive both Ad Hoc and Distribution builds where both have different settings there is no other way to do this but to go and change the build config archive uses in the Scheme, or create a 2nd scheme just for that.p  pIs there an easy way to accomplish this without using multiple schemesp

Negative 1104 pIve got a situation that keeps cropping up in my system and Im looking for a good codeconfig pattern.  I havent come up with one that makes me happy yet.p  pThe system is springbased and almost all of the beans are lazilyinitialized.  There are a number of different main classes that use the same spring context.  Each one ends up using a different subset of the beans by explicitly initializing a few beans and then spring takes care of initializing all the dependencies. Everything works great except for this one case.p  pThe problem is that some of my beans use a pattern in the spring config where my business bean is declared and then another bean depends on it and provides some peripheral functionality.  However, the natural dependency of other beans is the former, being the business class.p  pHeres an examplep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltbean idcachegt   ... ltbeangt  ltbean idcacheCuller classScheduledJobBeangt   ltproperty namescheduler refschedulergt   ltproperty namejobDetailgt     ltbean classorg.springframework.scheduling.quartz.MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBeangt       ltproperty nametargetObject refcachegt       ltproperty nametargetMethod valueremoveExpiredEntriesgt       ltproperty nameconcurrent valuefalsegt     ltbeangt   ltpropertygt   ltproperty namerepeatInterval value300000 gt ltbeangt codepre  pSo, the second bean above basically registers a trigger with the scheduler that will cause a method on the first bean to be called periodically.  Remember, all these beans are lazy.  I dont want to create cacheCuller and have that initialize cache if there are no active cache client beans.  I want spring to initialize cache when it needs to be injected into a dependency this is easy but I also want it to initialize cacheCuller immediately afterwards this is hard.p  pI know that I can put the scheduling logic into the cache class, but I thought it would be nice to keep it in spring configuration.  Id also like to keep the cache class free of springspecific code.  If other beans naturally depended on cacheCuller this would be easy, but they dont.p  pThe same situation comes up in other areas, like registering the beans with the MBeanServer.  Id like to have a second bean register the business bean, but I dont want that to initialize the business bean itself if its not being used as a dependency of some other third bean.p

Normally I would create a Windows Service for this, but the site will be hosted within a shared hosting environment, and unless I get a virtual server, then this isnt a possibility.p  pMy first thought was to have a thread running in the background that would do this and it would be created on ApplicationStart and destroyed on ApplicationEnd.

Negative 1104 pHere is a good linear solver named a hrefhttpwww.tacc.utexas.edutaccprojectsgotoblas2 relnofollowGotoBLASa. It is available for download and runs on most computing platforms. My question is, is there an easy way to link this solver with the Mathematica kernel, so that we can call it like LinearSolve  One thing most of you may agree on for sure is that if we have a very large Linear system then we better get it solved by some industry standard Linear solver. The inbuilt solver is not meant for really large problems.p  pNow that Mathematica 8 has come up with better compilation and library link capabilities we can expect to use some of those solvers from within Mathematica.  The question is does that require little tuning of the source code, or you need to be an advanced wizard to do it.  Here in this forum we may start linking some excellent open source programs like GotoBLAS with Mathematica and exchange our views. Less experienced people can get some insight from the pro users and at the end we get a much stronger Mathematica. It will be an open project for the ever increasing Mathematica community and a platform where these newly introduced capabilities of Mathematica 8 could be transparently documented for future users. p  pI hope some of you here will give solid ideas on how we can get GotoBLAS running from within Mathematica.  As the newer compilation and library link capabilities are usually not very well documented, they are not used by the common users very often. This question can act as a toy example to document these new capabilities of Mathematica. Help in this direction by the experienced forum members will really lift the motivation of new users like me as well as it will teach us a very useful thing to extend Mathematicas number crunching arsenal.p

Negative 1104 pI have two dependent dropdowns on a JSF page that work fine. I use a valueChangeListener on the first dropdown that populates the List backing the second dropdown.p  pHowever when I try to submit my form its failing JSF validation. From testing I think the problem is that when the page loads my dependent dropdown list is empty, then I populate it after the first dropdown has a selection made. However none of the values now in the dependent list were in the list when the page loaded so its fails validation. I have confirmed this by using a constructor to set up the list with all the possible values when the page loads and it makes my problem go away however this isnt a possible solution as loading up all the values would kill the performance of my page.p  pAny ideas how I can get it workingp  pRegards, Kevin.p

Do both browsers just have bugs, which are exposed when I dont set the AcceptRanges header  This seems unlikely to me.  Can anyone explainp  pThanksp

Negative 1104 pWe have a simple utility app that reads all the time zone data used in a JRE and displays it all in a simple table.

Negative 1104 pI have a bit of a quandry on my hands which hopefully you can help with.p  pIve been developing a Silverlight application for a client in Silverlight 4. However it became apparent that I needed to have a button to allow for full screen mode. This was fine and dandy, but when in full screen mode Silverlight 4 disables most of your keyboard inputs for security reasons....... so the reason of going full screen to make entering data into the ChildWindowForms easier then became pointless.p  pI should point out I cant make this application out of browser due to it having to sit inside Dynamics CRM 2011 to get the context and record id it is sitting on.p  pThus began my forray into silverlight 5. This version allows for applications to run inbrowser in Elevated trust mode. Previously only available as an out of browser mode.p  pAll was going great, i had figured out that I needed to get a certificate to sign my code, add some registry keys and the user to add a certificate to trusted publishers and got it working. Awesome.p  pMy problem arose when i tried to run my application and i got an exception like thisp  precodeThere is an error in XML document 1, 41. gt System.TypeAccessException  Attempt by security transparent method to access security critical type failed. codepre  pAt this point, all that had changed code wise was I had signed my projects with a certificate. p  pIt seems that in Silverlight 5 It doesnt trust the codeXmlSerializercode object Im using to read in some XML configuration and deserialize into a .Net Objectp  pAfter some digging it seems theres a new Serializer in town to do this for Silverlight 5, the codeDataContractSerializercode So i thought, great I can just ammend some of the serialization code and all will be fine. Sadly not the case.p  pIt seems that this version of the Serializer is 33 quicker in this version. The reason it is quicker, is all nodes in the XML must be in alphabetical order. If they are not in this order they are read in as null. If they happen to be in the correct position they will be read in correctly though. p  pSo my question is this. strongDo I have no choice but to reorganize all my XML configuration files into alphabetical order to adapt to this new Serialzer, or is there a way to use the old XML serializer and make Silverlight 5 trust itstrongp

This is working fine.p  pMy question involves replacing instances of 0, 1, 2, etc within the input string with table values.  0 corresponds to the 0th column, 1 for the 1st column, 2 for 2nd, etc. Additionally, it must grab the column value for the current row that is being modified.p  pTo clarify with an example, lets take the tablep  precode1    cat     description 2    dog     description 3    fish    description codepre  pIf I entered Row 0 is for 1 for my input and executed it on the 3rd column, the result would bep  precode1    cat     Row 1 is for cat 2    dog     Row 2 is for dog 3    fish    Row 3 is for fish codepre  pHopefully that is a sufficient explanation p  pSo, here is a sample within the example tablep  precodelttrgt     lttdgtlttdgt     lttdgtltbutton classformat col1gtFormat Colltbuttongtlttdgt     lttdgtltbutton classformat col2 gtFormat Colltbuttongtlttdgt lttrgt  lttrgt     lttdgtltinput typetext col0 row0 value0 size1gtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput typetext col1 row0 valuecat gtlttdgt     lttdgtltinput typetext col2 row0 valuedescription gtlttdgt lttrgt  ... codepre  pand here is the code for the format button at the top of each columnp  precodetd button.format.onclick, function         get formatter variables and column number     string  formatter.attrvalue     column  this.attrcol       regex to globally look for d where d is an integer     var re  new RegExpd, g      td input[col  column  ].eachfunction row           replace string here       codepre  pCurrently, this code structure will capture the 1st columns values and works finep  precodetd input[col  column  ].eachfunction i      this.attrvalue, string.replacere, td input[col1 row  i ].attrvalue  codepre  pBut doing something like this with input, 2 will result in undefined 2.

However, I know the code in general is correct since hardcoding codecol2code will work.p  pAny thoughts on why this is running into trouble. I want to say its a syntax issue, but maybe I am wrong.  p  pSidenote This could all be avoided if I just used the codere.matchcode function and iterated over the returned array.  I know a solution exists, im just seeing if there is a more elegantcleaner way to do it.p  pI know this is long, sorry  I figure more info is better than not enough.

Negative 1104 pFor the code shown below, If I print the addresses, I get the following.p  precodeamptestvar1  0x7fff0067d87c ampbarrier passed argument  0x7fff0067d770 ampi passed argument  0x7fff0067d77c amptestvar2  0x7fff0067d78c codepre  pThere are two things I dont understand here. First is that I read that C pushes arguments from right to left, then how strongampistrong is greater than strongampbarrierstrong. Knowing that stack grows from a higher address to a lower address, strongampistrong should be at a lower address. Moreover, the local variable strongtestvar2strong is at even a greater address.p  pSecondly, one would expect the value of strongampbarrierstrong and strongamptestvar1strong to be close together, but no, you see a big difference of 268 bytes. What is the stack holding in betweenp  pNote that Im using optimization O3. Is this due to that Maybe the compiler has played some tricks here I use volatile to make sure every variable is on the stack here and not cached in some register.p  precodevoid somefunc  .........    volatile int testvar1  0  callfunc i, ampbarrier  ........   void callfunc volatile int i, volatile pthreadbarrier barrier    volatile int testvar2  0  ........  codepre

Negative 1104 pI got a Neurosky Mindwave for Christmas and was immediately unimpressed with the standard software for it.

Negative 1104 pIm using Mercurial to create repositories based on other repositories i.e. merging them together. This is done by a nice little webinterface using PHP on the server.p  pUnfortunately, for some tasks this is extremely slow no wonder, PHP currently has to exec hg about 40 times per request.

Am I allowed to completely disregard the hierarchy and provide photos in combination with queries like thisp  precodephotosowner42 photostagged42 codepre  h2Caching when content differs for different usersh2  pA Web Service should be designed to provide cacheable data so that the client could decide to use the local copy, if it thinks that nothing has been changed, but how does that affect the privacy settings for different users Two users, both logged in, might have the rights to view different information about e.g. user 42. Does that mean that I somehow need to request different URIs for different users accessing the profile information of the same user, or will the caching not be an issue as long as the users provide different credentialsp  h2Providing both HTML and JSONXML from the same resourceh2  pThe book I mentioned specifies the rule that an API should be accessible at a subdomain starting with codeapicode, in their example codehttpapi.soccer.restapi.orgcode. I had planned to use the same controller for both user access and machine access for example a mobile app. The controller would decide on which view to provide codetexthtmlcode, codeapplicationjsoncode or codeapplicationxmlcode through the codeAcceptcode field in the HTTP request header. I take it that that would be a bad idea for some reason since a user would expect to see the subdomain codewwwcode, not codeapicode, but I dont understand why. Can codewwwcode and codeapicode point to the same server, or should I really try to move the HTML view to a different virtual host Whyp  pI believe Ruby on Rails will Convention over Configuration provide both HTML and JSON from the same controller, thus sharing my idea that HTML and JSON are just different representations of the same data.p  pIn other words, my book says that a certain resource should have one and only one URI, and that different representations should be provided based on the codeAcceptcode field. Redirecting the user between different subdomain would violate the rule about providing any representation from the same resource, and duplicating the information i.e. pointing two subdomains to the same virtual host violates the rule about not providing multiple URIs for the same resource. Not providing the codeapicode subdomain violates yet another design rule. How can I solve this without violating any rulep  h2Limiting the data sent backh2  pThe query component should be used for pagination, but am I allowed to refuse to honor listing requests lacking search criteria and limit the number of items, without violating REST I want to both reduce the database load and avoid having someone map the entire directory of users. I wantp  precodeusers codepre  pto be an illegal request, whilep  precodeusersnameleethacker codepre  pwould be valid but only return e.g. 100 items.p  pI also wonder if its legal to return a subset of the database columns and moreall of them only if theyre specifically requested using a query.p  h2Controllers providing redundant datah2  pI believe its legal to provide a controller likep  precodeusersme codepre  pbut should it provide the exact same information as the document URIp  precodeusers42 codepre  por should it redirect to itp  h2Extended rights for some usersh2  pWhich is the RESTful way to provide additional functionality, for example administration rights Im now assuming that an administrator of a photo, of a group of users or of the entire site will be able to see more information about a particular object than other users. Should that information be kept at exactly the same URI and be sent automatically to the administrator but not to anyone else, should it be stored at a different location, should it be requested using a certain administrator query or provided in some other wayp  h2Localization and settings updatesh2  pAlthough the majority of strings visible to the user should be provided by the view, there are some design decisions that might involve the API. The most obvious are names. Social networks sometimes allow the user to enter different names that are to be displayed in different language contexts. Names in some languages, like Russian and Arabic, are not easily transcribed automatically. In other languages, like Chinese, the local and international names can be completely different, with no resemblance or connection at all. What would be the RESTful way of handling this I have a feeling that the answer will be the codeAcceptLanguagecode field, but is anyone seriously considering that for switching languages on the social network they belong to Should all this information be returned to the caller every time, or can I rely on the settings Will that work with a cachep

Negative 1104 pI have a variation of the assignment problem that the usual MunkresHungarian algorithm seems illequipped to solve.p  pIn the traditional assignment problem, there are n workers who need to be assigned to n jobs, and a matrix that contains the cost of assigning each worker to each job.p  pIn this variation, we have only m m lt n workers. As the Munkres algorithm requires an equal number of workers and jobs we create n  m dummy workers who can be assigned to the spare jobs. Additionally, the jobs themselves are organised in a large number of discrete categories.p  pWe would like to impose the constraint that at least 1 job from each category is assigned to a real nondummy worker. This is difficult to do elegantly you can for example pick a random job from each category and artifically deflate each realworker associated cost, but this is a very crude solution that severely compromises the integrity of the final assignment.p  pWhat we do currently is run the algorithm multiple times, each time evaluating the output assignment and then modifying the cost matrix such that the costs for all jobs in any categories that were assigned only dummy workers are reduced slightly. This works adequately, but for moderately large data sets n  500 the process can take a while each Munkres assignment takes perhaps 10 seconds to compute, and with sufficient categories there can be a nontrivial number of iterations.p  pIs there a modified Munkres algorithm, or a different algorithm entirely, that will solve this problem more efficientlyp

Negative 1104 pIn summary, my full screen shader is not outputting anything,p  pI am writing a deferred shader in GLSL and I have gotten to the stage where I am applying lights in screen space. I have an ambient pass where I basically write the diffuse intensity from the GBuffer to the default FBO, this works fine. I then apply another full screen quad to calculate the directional light in the scene, again this samples from the GBUffer and should be blended with the default FBO.p  pThe problem I am having is that the directional light shader does not output anything. I use the same matrices and transformations as I do with the ambient pass but nothing changes.p  pI have tried the followingp  ol liOutput the same colour at every fragment in the ambient pass to ensure it is outputting at all. Worksli liOutput the same colour at every fragment in the directional light pass. Still get nothingli liUse the screen resolution for XY vertex coordinates as opposed to normalised coordinates ul liThis works for the ambient pass as I can see the results changing as expected.li liIt changes nothing for the directional light pass and I get the same output.li ulli liChange the ambient shader to sample from the normal or position buffers to ensure the textures can be sampled from Workingli ol  pHeres the application codep  precodeglBindFramebufferGLREADFRAMEBUFFER, mGeometryBuffergtmName glBindFramebufferGLDRAWFRAMEBUFFER, 0 glDrawBuffers1,drawbuffers glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT  mAmbientShadergtBegin     mAmbientShadergtSetUniformInt1Diffuse,mDiffuseTexturegtmTextureUnit      Draw full screen quad     glBeginGLQUADS         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,0,0         glVertex2i1,1         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,1,0         glVertex2i1,1         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,1,1         glVertex2i1,1         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,0,1         glVertex2i1,1     glEnd mAmbientShadergtEnd  const DirectionalLightamp dl  scene.GetDirectionalLight  glDrawBuffers1, drawbuffers mDirectionalLightShadergtBegin mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformInt1Diffuse,mDiffuseTexturegtmTextureUnit mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformInt1Position,mPositionTexturegtmTextureUnit mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformInt1Normal,mNormalTexturegtmTextureUnit mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformFloat3LightDir,dl.GetDirection mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformFloat3LightAmb,dl.GetAmb mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformFloat3LightDiff,dl.GetDiff mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformFloat3LightSpec,dl.GetSpec mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformFloat3LightAtt,dl.GetAtt mDirectionalLightShadergtSetUniformFloat1LightIntensity,dl.GetIntensity      Draw full screen quad     glBeginGLQUADS         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,0,0         glVertex2i1,1         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,1,0         glVertex2i1,1         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,1,1         glVertex2i1,1         glMultiTexCoord2iGLTEXTURE0,0,1         glVertex2i1,1     glEnd mDirectionalLightShadergtEnd codepre  pPlease excuse me if my math is wrong, I have been messing around with the shaders to try and get any sort of output but here are the shader source filesp  plt directionallight.vert p  precodevarying out vec2 ScreenPos  varying out vec3 VSLightDir  uniform vec3 LightDir uniform vec3 LightAmb uniform vec3 LightDiff uniform vec3 LightSpec uniform float LightIntensity  void main      glPosition  glVertex     ScreenPos  glMultiTexCoord0.st     VSLightDir  normalizeglModelViewMatrix  vec4LightDir,0.0.xyz  codepre  plt directionallight.frag p  precode Gbuffer textures uniform sampler2D Diffuse uniform sampler2D Position uniform sampler2D Normal  in vec2 ScreenPos uniform vec3 LightDir uniform vec3 LightAmb uniform vec3 LightDiff uniform vec3 LightSpec uniform float LightIntensity  in vec3 VSLightDir out vec4 OutColour  void main       Sample from the GBuffer     vec4 Diffuse  texture2DDiffuse, ScreenPos     vec4 VSPos  texture2DPosition, ScreenPos     vec4 MRT2  texture2DNormal, ScreenPos     vec3 VSNormal  normalizeMRT2.xyz     float Shininess  MRT2.w      float LDotN  dotVSNormal, VSLightDir      vec3 View  normalizeVSPos.xyz       Compute ambient contribution     vec3 ambient  LightIntensity  LightAmb  Diffuse.xyz       Compute diffuse contribution     vec3 diffuse  LightIntensity  LightDiff  Diffuse.xyz  max0.0, LDotN       Compute specular contribution     vec3 HalfWay  normalizeLightDir  View     vec3 specular  LDotN lt 0.0                  vec30.0                  LightIntensity  LightSpec  Diffuse.xyz  powmax0.0, dotVSNormal,HalfWay, Shininess      OutColour  vec4ambient  diffuse  specular, Diffuse.a     OutColour  vec40.0,0.0,1.0,1.0 Debug line  codepre  plt ambient.vert p  precodevarying out vec2 ScreenPos  void main      glPosition  glVertex       Used for the position to sample from GBuffer     ScreenPos  glMultiTexCoord0.st  codepre  plt ambient.frag p  precode Gbuffer textures uniform sampler2D Diffuse  in vec2 ScreenPos  out vec4 OutColour  void main      OutColour  texture2DDiffuse, ScreenPos     OutColour  vec40.0,0.0,1.0,1.0  codepre

Negative 1104 pI am new to Oracle and hope someone can clarify this scenario for me.p  pI have written a very large query that returns a set of dates with it Oracle 10g. p  pIn SQL Developer, these dates appear in DDMONYY format ex 12MAY12.

Someone on our offshore team where our QE servers are hosted noticed that the fields value is being converted to an IST offset its converted to XML using GetXml for the DataSet.

Its coming over like thisp  p20120511T0609150530p  pTheres no intrinsic date conversion function used, just the name of the field that pulls out the date. p  pHow can I modify my query so that the offset coming over we do need to preserve the time portion of the Date is not taken into consideration when the query is run I know the question sounds convoluted, but the end result is data being written to another database overseas contains the wrong offset, so its being converted to dates that are off by 1 day.p  pBasically I want the time but not the offset.p

Negative 1104 pThe TLDR version Bulk Insert will tell you how many rows it affected. It will NOT tell you how many rows it TRIED to affect, or how many failed. The problem with this is intuitively obvious, and I want to know if there is a more reliable way of uploading from text files, keeping the code inside the server.p  pThe Full Version I have an application which needs to periodically upload text data files into SQL Server tables. For some wild and crazy reason I thought to put this in a stored procedure to make it part of an abstraction layer rather than have the front end application write directly to the tables.p  pAs with most SQL Server scripting I spent my usual share of time bashing my head against a brick wall to get it to work at all. With no small amount of help from searching past posts on this site and others.p  pWill Bulk Insert read a header row to determine which fields to write to Nope, I have to either use a Format File and hope that the table structure  order never changes or use a staging table containing only the columns in the data file. The staging table receives the data prior to copying it to the real table.p  pWhat if you omit a single column in the target table even one which has a default and dont use a Format File You get the ohsoselfexplanatory error message Cannot fetch a row from OLE DB provider BULK for linked server null. Using the aforementioned staging table, omitting any columns which arent in the data source, gets around this.p  pThats fine, I can live with that. Its not the scary part. This is.p  pIf the staging table still has any fields which are defined as NOT NULL, but a data source row is null for that column, you do not get an error. Based on my tests, if you have say 5 rows of data and row 3 is missing data in a NOT NULL field, then you wont get an error but will get the message 4 rows updated. Which is all fine and dandy if youre expecting 5 rows and do a crosscheck against the number of rows affected to make sure that the expected number is there, but these files will be of varying lengths and Bulk Insert will not tell you how many rows it actually read. Worse, in some cases a missing field in one row will prevent the following valid row from uploading as well.p  pThe obvious solution Remove the NOT NULL constraints from the staging table and handle any null exceptions in the interface between the staging table and the real table. However... my concern is that this piece of cr...ode may do the same thing in other circumstances that I havent come across yet. That is, read a row, fail to write it to the staging table, and not throw an exception so that nobody knows that data is missing until they go looking for it and find that it just aint there. Even Access has better text import options than this.p  pMy question, then, is... is there a better more reliable way of handling uploads of variable row length text files to SQL Server without having to rely on the front end app to do itp  pThanks in advance for any advice.p
Negative 1104 pIm encountering an error sprintf statement. I added a printf command to help investigate, and it seems that maybe one of my doubles isnt being understood printf outputs a string of nonsense numbers where a 3.1f should be. However, the double is interpreted correctly the first time it is called in the printf statement. By increasing the size name from 120 to 320, the segfault does go away. But the double is still not interpreted correctly, i.e. it still outputs a string of nonsense numbers where a simple 3.1f should be. I cant figure out what Im doing wrong.

Negative 1104 pI have a four column design and I am using Bootstrap. The design renders fine in a single column in mobile devices, but in minwidth 768px and maxwidth 979px, I get four columns though there is room for only two. So clearly, the rowsspans setup would need to be rethought for those sizes. p  pThe only way I can imagine of doing this is  to have semantic CSS classes used in the HTML and only including grid classes in the CSS using LESS, and then depending on screen size, including different grid classes to achieve four or two column layout. Not sure if this would work either though.p  pIs this the way to go with, or am I thinking this too complicatedlyp  pThanksp  pEDIT This does NOT work. It only imports the rules that apply directly to .row, none of the more complicated rules .row is involved with.

Negative 1104 pWe have a java service that computes some logical operations on a huge binary matrix 10 000 x 10 000. This matrix is array of bitsets.

Data sparsity is moderate could be many 0 or 1 in a row, bitset size is fixed. p  pThe most important thing for us is fast response times for now its 0.05 sec, so we would like to find ways for further improvements as the matrix and the quantity of requests are growing.

One major issue I have is that all of the elements that should appear, should also be required as well and the others should not be required.  I would prefer to use DataAnnotation validation.  Should I initially render all of the form elements and use javascript to determine which ones to showhide based upon dropdown selection  The issue here seems to be how do I vary the required logic while maintaining the validation logic that makes sure that if anything is entered in any field, it is validated  On the other hand, it seems like overkill to create a partial view for each form that is needed and showhide the partial view based upon dropdown selection, not to mention inefficient due to the rountdrips.p
Negative 1104 pI have a function that looks something like the code below. Its purpose is to take triangle facets one at a time from an array of points where each three points is one facet, and tessellate them, replacing the facet with a list of smaller facets whose side lengths dont exceed nodeSize.p  pNaturally, this function is time consuming for any realistic facet mesh. Id like to refactor it to use some coarse parallelization. However, Parallel.For doesnt appear to have a way to step through indices in an array at intervals while preserving the index number. p  pBearing in mind that the codeSplitTrianglecode function inside the loop is computationally not conducive itself to parallelization, how could I refactor this functionp  precodeProtected Shared Function SplitTrianglesPoints As IEnumerableOf Point3D, nodeSize As Single As ListOf Point3D     Dim resultList As New ListOf Point3D          For i As Integer  0 To Points.Count  1 Step 3             resultList.AddRangeSplitTrianglePointsi, Pointsi  1, Pointsi  2, nodeSize  4         Next      Return resultList End Function codepre

Negative 1104 pI have two lists a source list and a destination list. Both lists consist of all the same items, but the lists are in a different order. Given the two lists, I need to find a series of swap operations on the source list that will swap one item in the list with another, eventually ending up with the source list in the same order as the destination list.p  pI am writing a script that shuffles an MPD playlist by albums, as this functionality is not in MPD by default. The script currently obtains the current playlist the source list, performs a custom shuffle of the list, and end up with a new ordering of songs the destination list. The script then removes all items from the playlist and inserts them back in to the playlist in the order of the new, shuffled playlist. Removing and adding all of the songs is a slow operation. The MPD library provides a much quicker in place swap of two songs in the playlist, but I do not know how to find the correct series of swap operations to transform the source list to the new shuffled list.p  pThis is written in Haskell, but an answer in any languagepseudo code is fine.p

Negative 1104 pOur designers have come up with a nice design that involves the index on the right side of the UITableView to be taller than the UITableView itself.

Negative 1104 pBackground  The company I work for has a regular SharePoint list with a custom ContentType that does not inherit from a calendar list item that it uses for Events.  It then shows these using a calendar view.  Seems simple enough.  We have the need to allow the user to choose a timezone for the event different from their regional setting that they are adding and to add the information to sharepoint such that it will show the correct time for each user looking at it world wide based on their regional setting of course.  I added a list to SharePoint that is used to lookup SystemTimeZones basically a SharePoint List representation of TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZonesp  precode                SPList timeZonesList  thisWeb.Lists.TryGetListSystemTimeZones                  iftimeZonesList  null                                      string title  SystemTimeZones                     string description  SharePoint List representation of TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZones used for lookup.

The forms are direct copies of what SharePoint Designer would create in that they are using the SharePointFormFields they are just in Visual Studio bc I needed codebehind. I wanted to allow the users to see the events in their Regional TimeZone however when they edit them I wanted to show them in the TimeZone they were entered. IE my regional timezone is Central so when I look at a Mountain meeting it will show me 1011am but when I edit that same meeting it will say it is 910am.

Of course Im slightly new to SharePoint  not c  so I may have very much over complicated this, but I have been able to fine little documentation online.  In the end I end up settingp  precode                    addedItem[StartDate]  regionalTimeZone.UTCToLocalTimecorrectedEventStart.ToUniversalTime                     addedItem[EndDate]  regionalTimeZone.UTCToLocalTimecorrectedEventEnd.ToUniversalTime TADA It saves and display perfectly I was so excited Until... I tried to save a recurring event. All of my recurring events save wonderfully, its not the recurring part thats messed up. For some reason, after I change the StartDate and EndDate on a recurring event and call addedItem.Update it is recalculating the Duration as if it is a single even instead of a recurring event.  Example I have an event that happens for a week daily from 910.  When I first enter ItemAdded my Duration is 3600 1 hour as it should be bc Duration is treated differently for recurring events. However after I adjust the times and call Update the duration spans the entire week  If I manually set the Duration                      if isRecurrence                                              addedItem[Duration]  correctedEventEnd.TimeOfDay  correctedEventStart.TimeOfDay.TotalSeconds                        codepre  pIt still gets reset on Update.  So when you view the recurring item in a Calendar View the item spans the entire week instead of showing once a day.p  pI have all but pulled my hair out trying to figure this out.  Any guidance would be wonderful. I understand Duration is a calculated field but I cant understand why calling listItem.Update would ignore the fact that it is indeed properly marked as a recurring event and not calculate the Duration correctly. This honestly seems like a bug with SP 2010.p  pThanks in advancep  pp  h2EDIT Additional info after comments below...h2  p This SharePoint env has a server in pacific time and users across all US TimeZones, London, Tokyo, Abu Dabi, etc.  Users in one timezone need to be able to create events in other timezones.  Since nothing in the users profile for us anyway will tell us what timezone they would like to see everything in, we added code to our master page to look at the local machines timezone and always set their regional setting accordingly.p  pstrongExamplestrong I am in Nashville and I want to create an event that will happen in LAp  pThe data in ItemAdded shows that StartDate is what I entered 9am. So Im creating a date that has PST at the end of itp  precodeDateTime correctedEventStart  DateTime.ParseaddedItem[StartDate]     eventTimeZone.GetUtcOffsetDateTime.UtcNow.Hours    eventTimeZone.GetUtcOffsetDateTime.UtcNow.Minutes DateTime correctedEventEnd  DateTime.ParseaddedItem[EndDate]     eventTimeZone.GetUtcOffsetDateTime.UtcNow.Hours    eventTimeZone.GetUtcOffsetDateTime.UtcNow.Minutes codepre  pThen to trick SharePoint Im converting that PST time into the users regional time so the user doesnt have to know anything about their regional setting nor do they have to think.  So 9am PST is 7am CST bc thats what SharePoint expects the time to be in since thats my regional setting.  Heres the converstion from the correct timetimezone to the user regional timezonep  precodeaddedItem[StartDate]  regionalTimeZone.UTCToLocalTimecorrectedEventStart.ToUniversalTime addedItem[EndDate]  regionalTimeZone.UTCToLocalTimecorrectedEventEnd.ToUniversalTime codepre  pI dont know if this makes sense to anyone outside of my world.  But SharePoint obviously expects the times to be in the users regional or the webs timezone.  Thats obvious my from unit testing.  If there is an OOB way for me to allow a user in Central Time to create a meeting from 910am Pacific Time in a custom list I would LOVE to be able to use that. But I havent been able to find anything.p  pAgain, all of this works great... until you come to Recurring Events.  And actually it works for recurring events until you try to view said event in a Calendar View.  Then it looks like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQxOb6.png altCalendar Viewp  pNotice that Recurring 8 is recurring the way its supposed to, daily for 2 instances. However, the span or duration of the recurrence is 2 days rather than 1 hour.  Where as Recurring 15 shows correctly.  The only difference in field values between the two when output to debug is the Duration field.  Recurring 8 had its start and end dates updated in ItemAdded and Recurring 15 went through ItemAdded but the ListItem.Update was commented out.  Per documentation SharePoint is supposed to calculate Duration differently for recurring items than it does for single items.  The fact that the start and end dates are changed using the object model should not negate that.p

Negative 1104 pWhile debugging why my extension doesnt work in Safari but does for other browsers, noticed that I can send an arbitrary made up HTTP header with XmlHttpRequest in a Safari toolbar extension. But try to do same with header named Cookie with same content as before, it doesnt get sent.p  pSo does Safari restrict sending back cookies with requests or you need to follow an alternate process to do so Seems kind of lame since this blocks functionality of apps that require session state persistence for example.

Negative 1104 pI wrote a small sound playing library with PortAudio on Linux.  Its for a small game, so there are lots of little sounds when various things happen.  I open up a stream for each wav file to play by calling PaOpenStream.  On linux this call takes on average around 10ms.  However on Windows this typically takes 40 to 70ms.  And worse, the first call takes 1.3 seconds. Then after that occasionally it will again take 1.3 seconds. I havent been able to find anything consistent about why it hangs, except that it happens every first call.

Negative 1104 pTrying to figure out a way where I can have portrait and landscape images adjust to viewport size with maxheight and maxwidth scenarios.p  pThe images should keep 100 width as long as the width doesnt exceed 1050px. Another constrainer is that images should be 800px in height at most. So whichever is true first should constrain the size of the image.p  pIf I set codemaxwidth 1050pxcode and codemaxheight 800pxcode then the aspect ratio of the image is messed up. As seen in the demo below. Theres also the problem that the image width will be wider than the actual image the portrait image of 836px width will upscale to 1050px.

Negative 1104 pWhen a GWT ScrollPanel is set to automatically show scrollbars, are there an event to tell when the scrollbars are shown or hiddenp  pI need this in order to update the layout for inner components when they are added or removed. When the toolbars pop into view after content being added, after subcomponents outside of my controls are expanded, I get both horizontal and vertical scrollbars because the content is slightly wider than scrollbar container with scrollbars added.p

Negative 1104 pSo I have this old PowerBuilder MDI application medium enterprise app with about 40 windows, and Im embarking on designing my very first WPF MVVM C application to replace the aging PowerBuilder app. Ive got plenty of C amp .NET experience, but this is my first WPF amp MVVM app. p  pAfter reading many forum postings after searching for WPF amp MDI alternative, Ive come to the conclusion that the MDI isnt supported, and that the most commonly proposed substitute is to use the TabControl and dynamically generate the content of each tab page upon demand using a WPF User Control. I had initially been sold on this, and was actually excited by my initial prototype interface with a tabbed Ribbon bar at the top of the app, and the TabControl with the tabs of the app underneath that. However, I have hit a BIG brick wall.p  pTake a look at the following screen shot of one of the central multitab windows from my old application a hrefhttpwww.creativedatatech.comdownloadsscreenshot.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.creativedatatech.comdownloadsscreenshot.jpgap  pAs you can see, the app has a toolbar across the top and the left side, and the example MDI child window Case Edit Window that is open has a LOT of tab pages 18 of them, and the users really like being able to quickly click on a tab page to get directly to that information to work on it. Moreover, the users have grown accustomed to being able to open multiple Cases at once and either put them side by side large monitors, or flip back and forth, possibly copying amp pasting between them. p  pThe problem here is that I cannot envision how I am going to incorporate all this multitab user experience for the Case Edit Window into a single tab of the top level WPF TabControl. Will the users end up seeing a row of tabs for the WPF TabControl, with one tab for each Case Edit Window that is open, and then inside each Case Edit tab page, a further nested set of 18 tab pages  This seems confusing and a big mess of nested tabs. Add to that the tabs of the Ribbon control at the top of the app, and I think my users will be running after me to lynch mep  pAfter investing two straight weeks reading up on WPF and MVVM, I am left with the sinking feeling that WPF really isnt going to fly well for enterprise apps such as mine. Surely this cant be true Does anyone have any comments on how I should go about shaping this app to accomplish what Im trying to do here br  Ive already looked at WPF pages, but I cant have the users serially navigate through all the individual pages to get to the content that they need to work on, and they need to be able to quickly and visually navigate to the Case Edit Window content that they need. p

Negative 1104 pI have a repo with a master branch and a branch called febupdate. A week ago or so I committed some new files to the febupdate branch and pushed the update to github. Since that time there were three more commits that were pushed to that branch.p  pThen someone came back and said that all those files from the commit a few weeks ago need to be pulled out because they are duplicates of other data. I wasnt sure how to do it so I asked for some advise and was told to codegit rebase HEAD3code. So I did that and I removed the bad commit and everything in my local copy was now the way it should be. But we couldnt figure out how to make the repo on github reflect that. Eventually we did a codegit push forcecode.p  pNow anytime someone does a codegit pullcode of that branch, they get asked to provide a reason for merging something in. And the user ends up with all of the duplicate files too. The only thing weve gotten to work is to blow away the whole folder and do a fresh codegit clonecode.p  pHere are my questionsp  ol liAfter we merge the febupdate branch into master will this behavior continue Will anyone that does a git pull from master get a dialog about merging in data and end up with the extra files that I tried to kill Do we need to tell everyone to blow away their local copy and do a fresh codegit clonecodeli liWhat was the proper way for me to have gotten rid of the files from the previous commit. I should point out that it was like 60some files so its not like I could have just done a git rm on two files.

In other words, Im adding a breakpoint at the codereadcode subroutine and running the code in gdb after the breakpoint is added. The program will continue to run as expected and give the correct outputs when I include write statements in the test program. However, if I use the gdb print options I receive an error of Cannot access memory at address 0x69bb80 for array codeqcode only. All other arrays and variables can be displayed with no problems.p  pAs I would like the codereadcode subroutine to be a stand alone subroutine and not necessarily use any global parameters, I have not used the global module and instead called the variable codekpcode into the subroutine. I decided to test whether using the global module would help, and if I use codejszcode in place of codekpcode, I do indeed remove the error. However, since this isnt my overall goal with the subroutine, I would hopefully like to figure out how to fix this without the use of the global module. I also tried not using the global at all and setting the parameter variable of codekpcode in the codetest.f90code program directly, but this also gives the error.p  pAny insight on possible reasons for this error, or suggestions to try and fix the memory addressing issue would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 1104 pI have a UITableView, where each cell contains a UICollectionView.p  pSo when we scroll, the TableViewCell is reused, but what is the proper way to setreset the UICollectionView p  pMore specifically, When we init the TableViewCell, the collectionView is created and inited with a layout object.  During cell reuse, the collectionView is not realloced, so that layout object is not realloced nor changed either. However, will the same layout object work properly when you reuse it  p

Negative 1104 pSo, Im working on a web services project.p  pBasically, it boils down top  ol liPLSQL side uploads a PDF file, then Base64encodes this file, then sends it to my REST webservice.li liJava webservice receives the file. I save this file before doing anything else just for a test as expected, the file is corrupt its a Base64string, this is normal.li liJava webservice Base64decodes the file and then proceeds to do whatever it needs to do with the file. I save the file once again after this decoding, and once again it works as expected and Im able to open and read the PDF.li liPLSQL now requests to redownload the file. I reencode the file and send it back to the requestor. I save the file after encoding, and as expected its Base64 encoded again it doesnt work corrupt.li liPLSQL receives the file, Base64decodes the file and tries to open it... Bam, corrupt, unable to read the file.li ol  pProbably something is wrong between the communication its Base64encoded in Java, Base64decoded in PLSQL. Youd suspect thered be no difference as its using a standard I guess Base64 is standard, right.p  pWe tried both options after I reencode the PDF in Java, I try to once again redecode it and save it this file is correct and Im able to read the PDF. So wed suppose the encoding in Java is correct. We also tried this in PLSQL  upload a BLOB, encode to Base64, decode it back, download and open. This also works. So wed suppose the encoding and decoding part in PLSQL works, too.p  pWhat is weird is that I can Base64 encode the file in PLSQL, then decode it in Java, then save and read it. It only goes wrong when I reencode the file in Java and try to decode it in PLSQL. So that sounds to me like there cant really be a problem between standards used in PLSQL  Java, because then the first step would fail too.p  pWere using the commons library in Java codeorg.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64code. In PLSQL, weve tried using the UTLpackages as well as a custom method as well as a Java stored procedure as well as the Apexwebservice codeapexwebservice.blob2clobbase64pblobcode and codeapexwebservice.clobbase642blobpclobcode.

However, I am running into a problem and I was really hoping somebody could explain it to me.p  pThe problem seems to be with the repaint inside the isRunning method. Whenever I run the program on Eclipse, I get the DealerPanel panel on my background only half of the times. The other half times that dont show the panel, I have to minimize the JFrame window and bring it back up again and the panel for DealerPanel is somehow displayed again.p  pI did a little search on my own and found out that repaint merely requests the AWT thread to call update which then calls paint and is therefore not a direct call to paint. Also,  repaint can be problematic since repaint only schedules for paint and returns immediately. Could this potentially have anything to do with my problemp  pTo summarize, my panel for background is always showing. However, my panel for Dealer Panel does not always show when I initially run the program. The times that the Dealer panel dont show, I hide and bring up the window and the panel is displayed.

Negative 1104 pget a EXCBADACCESScode2, address0x194d189a2p  pThis is a result of selecting a SKSpriteNode on one SKScene, saving the selection to NSUserDefaults, then reading the NSUserDefaults in the new scene to init the new SKScenes experience  this can happen for any of the provided selections but is not an issue generated consistently. It smells of a framework bug that creates a memory leak, though not verified in Instruments, not being plugged when SKs internal framework calls SKCSpriteremoveSubspriteSKCSprite, which is not a direct call from myself.p  pAt this point Ive not done any formal [SKNode removeFromParent] calls to remove my SKScenes SKSpriteNodes prior to transitioning to the new SKScene, although I have seen a few similar memory leak issues surrounding removeFromParent listed in stackoverflow.p  pAny thoughts An obvious issue  does it merit a radar post or is this just a goof on my part BTW never saw an issue with this before iOS 7.1,p  pBest,p  pHungry Developerp

So client will be able to get the result by requesting with the job id.p  pCurrently I am able to create Job objects from given parameters, added them to a queue using codeJMScode, a consumer process the job and put the result object to a another queue.

In case user opened the link on another device that has the same app installed I dont want the redirect to happen.p  pIs it possible from the context of Safari JavaScript to find out if the page is being open on the same device that a certain instance of app is running The app could be and is likely in background so I dont suppose running an http service in it would be of any goodp  pI could open a special page from the app that would drop a cookie that later can be detected but that wouldnt be nice since user will have to see browser flicker even if for a second before the page redirects him back to the appp  pAre there any good solutions to this problem in the post UDID ios world Is this any easier on androidp

Negative 1104 pI created a custom HtmlHelper to render an address on a webpage. The address needs to be dynamic based on the country the address is in. For this I have a simple interface with multiple implementations. My controller passes the specific implementation to the view which is strongly typed to the interface. When debugging, the view shows the correct implementing type and I pass that model to my custom HtmlHelper as a generic type parameter. This custom HtmlHelper only accepts models of type IAddress or its implementation, but the TModel is always IAddress no matter what type is passed into it. This is an issue due to the attributes on the individual implementations as I use the existing HtmlHelpers such as Html.EditorFor and Html.LabelFor within my own helper to render the fields and labels for the address including proper validation when submitted.p  pI believe the issues is that the View is strongly typed to IAddress and the HtmlHelper ignores the actual model type and goes straight for the view type, how can I get around thisp  pbrp  pInterface and Implementing Classesp  precodepublic interface IAddress       Dumbed down to one property to save space     String City  get set      String State  get set    public class AddressUS  IAddress       Required and displayed on page.

Negative 1104 pImagine a library in OCaml which might need to store its data somewhere. This persistence layer can be implemented with different libraries sqlite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and so on. And depending on the concrete technology of the storage, it may offer different features and performance guarantees.p  pWhat are possible ways to manage external dependencies for such library Lets say if I develop with MySQL I do not want to introduce neither compile time nor runtime dependencies on sqlite.p  pIn C I might use abstract interfaces and put the concrete logic into modules conditionally included into my project depending on configuration switches. I am curious, how anyone would approach the same task in OCaml.p

Negative 1104 pIve been given a project as my final deliverable for my degree working with another dev and am having some real trouble figuring out how to do it. Now firstly I need to avoid too much disclosure of the idea because the IP belongs to the uni, so Ill ask the questions regarding the tech and not the description of the application.p  pI need to make a web application that can support multiple logins to other websites. That is to say, you log in to my site, and are presented with multiple embedded browser windows with which you can log in to multiple other websites and see the changes live in each. Essentially, multiple browser windows in one tab, with a UI managed by our site. If it helps, imagine logging in to facebook as two different people and sending a PM between each other, the messages need to be seen live in both windows.p  pThe obvious difficulty were having with it is the concept of multiple sessions in one. Furthermore, once we manage to sort that out, were yet to figure out how to actually embed such a thing into a web page.p  pWeve experimented with a few technologies, but have come up a little empty.p  pOur first thought was to use some kind of custom serving technology like NodeJS and figure out how to allow for multiple sessions, but either due to lack of documentation, similar projects or just lack of experience on our behalf, that wasnt fruitful.p  pOur next thought was to use a browser extension in combination with a website and essentially use the extension to modify the browser and allow for multiple sessions. Again, as far as we can find, that idea doesnt really seem possible either.p  pAnother idea weve been playing with is using something called Awesomium, which is an opensource variant of Chromium Embedded Framework. Awesomium seems to be really quite good, and its supported for C and .NET. I managed to make a desktop application prototype that worked quite well with multiple sessions, but unfortunately it seems like Awesomium isnt made to work with ASP.NET, because really why would somebody want such a thing p. We were also considering attempting to use CEF ourselves but to be quite honest I didnt even know where to start with that and got nowhere.p  pThe final idea weve been playing with is trying to do something like a proxy site does, again somehow using multiple in one browser. This was kind of the other side of things where we were considering a hardware or networking based approach instead of software based.p  pI would love any kind of advice anyone can give, or even just some ideas or thoughts to discuss. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1104 pI have all my keybindings in a separate minor mode  firstly, to be sure that keybindings that I consider mandatory wouldnt be overridden by some major mode and secondly, to be able to disable all of them in one command in case I need too.p  pUp until now I have been extending prefix keys like sop  precodedefinekey myminormodemap kbd Mg f mygotofilefunc codepre  pBut then I realized that there is such thing as prefix keymap, and for codeMgcode key it is codegotomapcode. So Id rather extend this keymap instead of hardcoding the prefix key, so it would be likep  precodedefinekey gotomap kbd f mygotofilefunc codepre  pBut in this case my minor mode has nothing to do with it, so I lose all my advantages of using it.p  pOne way would be to determine which key is bound to that particular prefix keymap and then use that key in the bindings.

Negative 1104 pI would like to ask some help because I dont know what the problem is in this case.p  pI have a simple MVC5 application where I want to use angular and restangular. When I load the page the angular controller will be executed but the server is not called. It is just a test method nothing else.

According to Fiddler the result is json.p  pWhen I reload the page I got back nothing, only the promise object, I assume. According to Fiddler there is no server call that time. If I dump out the testResult object see the TestService.js file below it contains nothing and I see the there is a property fromServer and the value is false. I assume it indicates whether server communication happened or not.p  pI went through the restangular documentation but I havent found anything in it which helps me to get over this case.

Negative 1104 pive got the following problem.p  pIm using spring data in a Websphere 8 environment with Spring Data repositories created by CDI. The EntityManager is provided by a stateless session bean with a producer method. This works for now but I got a use case to create a timer on server startup. So there is a bean with an Startup annotation. The EJB timer is a singleton bean which is injected into the startup class and used in the postConstruct method of this class. Into that timer, there is a service bean injected EJB and this service has a Spring Data repository injected via CDI to get the timer interval form the DB. p  pSo the problem is. When WAS is starting, the CDI context is not completely initialized at the startup time. So the injection points cannot be satisfied.p  pThere is a WASJVM property to start the CDI context earlier but than the problem is, that the producer method in the EntityManagerProvider is not called and throws a null pointer.p  pIs There anybody who had already a problem close to that use case or with an idea what to do or what to change about this architecture to get it running without exceptions  p

So I need emreturned and matchingem the corresponding variants block that matches the variables submitted.p  pI hope Ive made sense of what Im trying to accomplish.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThis is what I am needing. p  pSo on my site the customers chooses a product, in this case a poster. Before adding it to the cart they are prompted to select a size. Lets say a 12x12. The way the API works is that it has a top item and then has smaller items variants that include the size and color. Each variant is a poster with a different size. The only way to obtain the poster product, is by receiving every variant for the poster. But each variant has a different id to send to the api to order the correct product.p  pSo, I receive the product and its variants in bulk or every color and size as its own variant. p  precodevariants [                      id 4464,             productid 1,             name Poster 1212,             size 1212,             color null,             colorcode null,             image httpsd1yg28hrivmbqm.cloudfront.netproducts14464.jpg,             price 9.00         ,                      id 1349,             productid 1,             name Poster 1216,             size 1216,             color null,             colorcode null,             image httpsd1yg28hrivmbqm.cloudfront.netproducts11349.jpg,             price 11.00         , codepre  pBut remember the customer wanted a poster that was 12x12 We only need to send the demand to print a 12x12 poster. So we need to send to the api the ID for the variant that matches the 12x12 size.p  pI need a way to search through each variant for a product and find the correct variant that matches the productid of the poster, and the size requirements of 12x12.p  precode                     id 4464,             productid 1,             name Poster 1212,             size 1212,             color null,             colorcode null,             image httpsd1yg28hrivmbqm.cloudfront.netproducts14464.jpg,             price 9.00         , codepre  pOnce I find that correct variant, I need to collect all that information into a new array and return it.p  precodeGet the product based on the supplied productid. results Break that array down into just the variants. vars Search the vars array for a block that matches the productid. Search those vars blocks for a single one that matches the size.  If color is supplied, search those vars blocks for a single one that matches the color.  If size and color are supplied, a single block should be returned that matches all three variables productid, size, and color. Sometimes size andor color is null. But a productid is always supplied. codepre  pI hope the clears up what I am needing a little better.p

Negative 1104 pFirst I want to say that Im in a programming school atm, and in the course called project development I received a half finished project from seniors to continue. So needless to say I dont know the project by heart and that paired with my inexperience, I hope you can forgive my possibly stupid questions.p  pIt is a Maven Web Application, the language used is Java. The database is a simpe JAVA DB Derby, the server is Glassfish 4.0. Both are used within the Netbeans 8.0 environment. p  pNow to the actual problem. The App is a online Questionnaire creation tool, so the user can create Questions, answers, upload a picture etc.. And it does work, everything is stored in the DB and persisted, I checked manually and the data is there and stays there after closing the App. However as soon as I relaunch the App, all DB content is lost. Yet not quite entirely, it seems that only the ID gets deleted, since when I upload a picture again, the old ones having the same ID that I uploaded last session appear instead.p  pOfc, my first thought was the persistence.xml and I did set it Table Generation Strategy to none. Here is my persistence.xml EclipseLinkJPA 2.1p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltpersistence version2.1 xmlnshttpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnspersistence xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnspersistence httpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnspersistencepersistence21.xsdgt   ltpersistenceunit nameOnlineTestCreatorPU transactiontypeJTAgt     ltjtadatasourcegtjdbconlinetestcreatordbltjtadatasourcegt     ltpropertiesgt     ltpropertiesgt   ltpersistenceunitgt ltpersistencegt codepre  pThis didnt solve the issue either, so next I went to the glassfishressources.xml and removed the createtrue Properties. This didnt solve it either.p  pI heard from a friend that sometimes the programm doesnt rebuild with the new settings properly and I have to make sure it cleans correctly. So I cleaned the App 10 times succesfully and Build everything again and tried but still no result. I also made sure that the DB name matched up with the entries in my persistence.xml and glassfishressources.xml. I am honestly at the end of my rather limited knowledge.p  pSo what could be causing all my DB content to dissapear everytime I launch the Appp  pIf anything is missing and you need further information just let me know and Ill try to provied it to the best of my ability.p
Negative 1104 pIve been using the HTTPS Test Script Recorder in Jmeter to record some amazon S3 actions. Specifically a file upload PUT. Problem is, the captured HTTP sampler has a body data that has some extra data inserted into it.p  pMy original sample file I uploaded is 25630 bytes. A small image file jpg. The one that gets uploaded with the captured HTTP sampler is 25723 bytes.p  pI performed a hex compare between the original and the one from the sampler. I downloaded normally what the captured sampler uploaded. What I found immediately was a single byte inserted very near the top of the file, which had the effect of offsetting everything else after that by one byte and making it all look different. Since the difference in size is just under 100 bytes, Im guessing this is happening in just under 100 other places in the file as well.p  pLook at the different ContentLength headers below...p  pHere is the headers from when I upload the file manuallyp  precodeUserAgent S3 Browser 461 https3browser.com xamzacl private xamzdate Thu, 23 Oct 2014 172508 GMT ContentType imagejpeg ContentLength 25630 codepre  pHere is the header that Jmeter sends based on the captured samplep  precodeConnection keepalive ContentType imagejpeg xamzdate Thu, 23 Oct 2014 165731 GMT xamzacl private UserAgent S3 Browser 461 https3browser.com ContentLength 25723 codepre  pDoes anyone know why this is and how I might modify my recorder so that it records the file data exactlyp

Negative 1104 pOkay, so Im writing code for a space blaster game, and all seems to be going well, minus these crucial issues.p  pFirst, I added a spaceship with PhysicsBody as a child of self GameScene.p  pThen I added a background layer as a node also as a child of self, behind the spaceship, and simulated movement by moving the background around behind the spaceship via joystick control.p  pI added a node with a boundary physics Edge Loop body so the background wouldnt move beyond the ship, and added that node as a child of the bgLayer. p  pI have objects for the spaceship to shoot at, but I want them to move around as the background does, so I added them as children of the bgLayer. p  pOf course, I needed a laser when the spaceship fires, so I added this as well as a child of the bgLayer.p  hr  precodespaceship.physicsBody  custom physicsBody code [self addChildspaceship]  bgLayer  [SKNode node] [self addChildbgLayer]  bounds  [SKNode node]  bounds.physicsBody  physicsBody edgeLoop code [bgLayer addChildbounds]  otherObjects.physicsBody  custom physicsBody code [bgLayer addChildotherObjects]  laser.physicsBody  custom physicsBody code [bgLayer addChildlaser] codepre  hr  pAll is well, the background doesnt move beyond the spaceship,the other objects move as the background moves, and the laser fires when called upon. p  pMy first big dilemma is when my laser fires, it does not move as the background moves, but the background moves behind it. I could probably make do but it looks funny if the laser always moves in parallel with the ship. This seems odd to me since I added the laser as a child of bgLayer. p  pSecond, my lasers physicsBody doesnt seem to recognize the EdgeLoop body, and sails right on through it. Also, my spaceships physicsBody seems to recognize the EdgeLoop body, but it does not recognize the other objects that are children of bgLayer. p  pDo Physics Bodies that are not children of the same layer recognize each other And why doesnt my laser behave similarly to other children of the same layerp

For example when program reads character C it should write its constant value 9107 to AX.p  pHere is my code p  precodedosIntr         equ     21h retToDos        equ     4ch noError         equ     0h octave C               9107 1193000131 D               8115 1193000147 E               7230 1193000165 F               6817 1193000175 G               6087 1193000196 A               5423 1193000220 B               4830 1193000247 W               1 pause   Progr           segment                 assume  csProgr, dsdata, ssstack start          mov     ax,data                 mov     ds,ax                 mov     ax,stack                 mov     ss,ax                 mov     sp,offset stack                  mov     si,0 index  play   read char from array                    mov     bl,notes[si] ascii code of note                 cmp     bl,X check if end                 je      soundEnd          changing ascii to constant                 mov     ax,bx copies only ascii code                     8253 send note                          out     42h,al                 mov     al,ah                 out     42h,al          8255 sound on                 in      al,61h                 or      al,00000011b                 out     61h,al          int15 timer                 xor     dx,dx dx  0                 mov     cx,8 half note                 mov     ah,86h                 int     15h          8255 sound off                 in      al,61h                 and     al,11111100b                 out     61h,al                  inc     si inc index                 jmp     play   soundEnd       mov     ah,retToDos                 mov     al,noError                 int     dosIntr Progr           ends  data            segment     notes db CWDWEWFWGWAWBWX  data            ends   stack          segment                 dw    100h dup0 top          Label word stack          ends   end start codepre

Negative 1104 pIm using SemanticsUI on my project. The website has a menu bar. Inside the menu bar there is one item that is a dropdown item. Ive managed to get the dropdown item working under normal circumstances. In my case I wanted to the dropdown to expand upon hover over of the mouse, which works properly...p  pHowever after I added the logic of HIGHLIGHTING the chosen menu item in the menu bar by adding active to the class of the item, I have found that the dropdown does not expand anymore but ATLEAST the menu item with the dropdown class is HIGHLIGHTED.p  pI thought to myself...okay...thats okay...what Ill do then is to find the dropdown item by using its id and tell it to remove the class active first and then tell it to expand....and then add back the active class. By doing this, the menu item with the drop down is HIGHLIGHTED at the beginning...I then hover over and now the drop down expands. But when I hover out the menu item with the dropdown is NO LONGER HIGHLIGHTED.  I inspect the element but it does have the active class......but whenever I add the active class in any of the menu item, the item gets HIGHLIGHTED because of it....or atleast that is what I think.p  pWhats going onp  pThis is the JQuery I used to remove active class, tell dropdown to expand, and then add active class back inp  precodeiosdropdown.hoverfunction     console.loghovered over iosdropdown .hover     if iosdropdown .hasClass active             iosdropdown.removeClassactive       iosdropdown.dropdownshow       iosdropdown.addClassactive        , function     console.loghovered out iosdropdown .hover    codepre  pThis is the html with semanticsui and MeteorJS spacebarsp  precode    lta idiosdropdown classui dropdown item activeRouteClass iosJyotish iosTibetanPhonetics               iosChinesePhonetics iosChaldean iosChinese365 iosArtOfWargt                  lti classapple icongtltigt                 lti classdropdown icongtltigt                 iOS Apps                 ltdiv classmenugt                   lta hrefpathFor iosJyotish classitemgtJyotishltagt                   lta hrefpathFor iosTibetanPhonetics classitemgtTibetan Phoneticsltagt                   lta hrefpathFor iosChinesePhonetics classitemgtChinese Phoneticsltagt                   lta hrefpathFor iosChaldean classitemgtChaldeanltagt                   lta hrefpathFor iosChinese365 classitemgtChinese 365ltagt                   lta hrefpathFor iosArtOfWar classitemgtArt Of Warltagt                 ltdivgt     ltagt codepre  pWhat should I do to get that menu item to be highlighted whenever any of its dropdown item is being displayedp  pThank youp

Negative 1104 pI measure the impulse response of a microphone. At beginning of plot i have some delay and then highest value comes at 40 ms and decreases till 45 ms.  When I take fourier transform, I only want to use the part between 3545 ms. when I use different microphones, delay decreases or increases so the peak value is shifting. So, the time range I want also changes. How I can get that range, which contains highest value, automaticaly in MATLABp

Negative 1104 pim writing a script that generates random data. i have two tables, one that stores first names, and second that stores surnames. i want to get e.g. 1000 random pairs of first name and surname. i can achieve it using following codep  precode    with x as      select top 1000 f.firstName from dbo.firstNames f order by newid     , xx as      select x.firstName, rownumber overorder by x.firstName as nameNo from x     , y as      select top 1000 s.surName from dbo.surNames s order by newid     , yy as      select y.surName, rownumber overorder by y.ulica as nameNo from y          select xx.firstName, yy.surName      from xx inner join yy on xx.nameNoyy.nameNo codepre  p...but what if one of my tables contains less than 1000 rows i wondered how to get more than n rows from table where n is less than quantity of rows in tableview and you dont mind repeated results. the only way i could think of is to use temp table and while loop, and fill it with random rows until there is enough rows. But i wonder if its possible to do it with a single select im currently using sql server 2012 on my PC, but i would appreciate it if i could run it under sql server 2008, too.p

Negative 1104 phow can a entity be a strong entity despite having a total relationship to another entity with 11 cardinality . for example , say, Manager entity has a 11 total relationship with Department lets call the relationship as managed by.

But the book i refereed to has stated otherwise, it says the Manager entity isnt weak even it has total relationship with Department entity. What am I missing here. Im confused.   p  poscar but...... that means there could be times where a manager dont manage a department, so then how can we call it a total relationship. p

Negative 1104 pI noticed codejQuerycode has one locale for codeSpanishcode which is codeescode.  When you change your browser to a codespanish localecode which can be codees, esUS, esMX, etccode, since there is only one jQuery spanish file, it only loads the file if the locale is codeescode.  Is there a way to convert between the locales that .NET returns to you using the codeCultureInfocode object to the ones that jQuery expectsp  pHere is scenario to better explain my situation.  If I change my browsers language to codeescode, codeCultureInfo.CurrentCulturecode returns codeesEScode, however, jQuery does not contain the locale codeesEScode, it just has codeescode, but in certain cases it does have something like codeenUScode and codeenGBcode, so what is the best way to go about this. Should I just rename locale files or do some sort of conversionp

Negative 1104 pI have a bash script sitting on a server and a Java app that will run on said server. My goal is to invoke this script, twice, from the Java app such that both will run concurrently.p  pI have the following codep  precodeRuntime runtime  Runtime.getRuntime Process process  runtime.execnew String[]  binbash, c, script.sh amp script.sh amp   codepre  pThis should invoke the script via bash, run it in the background, and then immediately set off another one before the first finishes the script takes about ten seconds to run. This all seems to work perfectly fine.p  pThe problem is, I then want to wait until both background processes have completed before moving on to the next line in my Java program. I tried thisp  precodeint exitValue  process.waitFor  next line of code codepre  pHowever, it seems that next line of code is running before both processes have really finished. I suspect that what is happening is that Java considers the process complete as soon as the second process is kicked off since they are both run in the background. My guess is that process.waitFor is really only good for tracking foreground processes.p  pI suppose one solution would be to make a temporary bash script that kicks off both processes in the background, run emthatem script in the foreground, and track its progress with process.waitFor. But I would really prefer not having to keep creating temporary scripts that call other scripts just so that it can run in the foreground.

Negative 1104 pI have written a log tailer with Powershell, the tailer loads in an xml file which contains configuration information regarding when to report on a word match in the log tail basically if certain patterns occur X amount of times in the tail.p  pAt the moment the tailer is not returning matches for many of the lines that contain matches.p  pFor example we are retrieving a log file with many INFO lines, if I check for the word INFO nothing is detected, however if I look for the work shutdown it returns matches the line with shutdown also contains INFO on the line. p  pThe really strange thing is that using the same log file and same Powershell script seems to produce perfectly accurate results on my own machine but behaves strangely on the server.p  pI suspect that this might be an issue with the version of Powershell that is running on the server, so I was hoping someone here might know of issues that can come up with different versions. I have also noticed that when I print out the number of matches, if nothing is found the output is blank, perhaps this should be 0 and is causing some weird issue to triggerp  precodefunction Main

Negative 1104 pbtlddr Character movement glitches easily, doesnt always seem to register key releases, and is overall poor any suggestions for improvements or bug fixesbp  pHello,br Im still working on making a relatively simple platformer game in SFML with C, and Im struggling with making smooth movement. My map is composed of a grid of x,y pairs, which define the tile that is to be displayed at that point the x and y represent the coordinates of the tile sprite in my level spritesheet.brbrp  pThe problem that Im having is that even though the movement emseemsem to work, it sometimes behaves in an unintended way, and I dont know how to fix it, or even why it might be happening.brbrp  pFor example, spamming rapidly pressing the arrow keys, you can sometimes get the character to slide across the map and lose control of him until he hits something. Other times, usually while coming in at an angle you can get stuck in the floor, and be unable to move unless you first jump to get unstuck.brbrp  pAs of right now, Im doing collision detection through the use of 4 points which represent the rectangle that is the characters hitbox, so that might be part of the issue.p  pemSide note my key presses also only detect the arrow keys and not WASD

Negative 1104 pMy app just got rejected, and the reason was that the Apple Watch Extension was Booting to White Screen on Apple Watch.

Negative 1104 pI have a project that uses wx pubsub heavily to communicate to various parts of the code.  For any given message, it could be of interest to 1 to 5 different subscribers.p  pIn a previous version of the code, I had a very large dictionary of listeners that looked something likep  precodeSENSORFLIP SENSOR FLIPPED,  ALARMTRIGGERED ALARM TRIGGERED,  etc codepre  pand I would subscribe in the various portions in the code that were interested in those events.  The problem started when the code started getting large and there were lists of subscribes in the inits of most objects.  It was unwieldy and became an issue of making it difficult to ever change anything about the messages or knowing what was receiving what.p  pSo then I tried standardizing messages to 3 types TASK, INFORM, and STATUS with an identifier at the beginning to show who sent it a generalized identifier, so it would send sensor STATUS rather than sensor 17 STATUS.  I then subscribed to the general areas I was interested in and let the listener sort through if it was actually interested or not.  The problem arose here with the signal interface TASK  there were a bunch and I had every sensor, station, service, alarm, light, etc in the entire system grabbing them and sorting through.p  pIs there a better way to organize this  All I can think of is going back to specific naming of signals and a group of lists in config that fleshout what each object is interested in, then doing a map subscribe at the init of each object to each thing in its list.p  pAny ideas on how to do it betterp

Negative 1104 pI have added few product features in Prestashop. One is Compatible BrandManufacturer, second is Compatible Series and third is Compatible Model. I associate them to products which are basically parts and each feature tells with which brand, series, and model it is compatible with. p  pWhat I want is a parentchild relation between these features. Brand as parent, series as child, and model as grand child. p  pFor example I am selling parts say RAM which is compatible with HP ProBook 4540s laptops. What I will do is select HP in Compatible Brands, Probook in Series, and 4540s and any other models in Model I already have module to enable multiple feature values. So, if I select HP then it should filter HP related series in Series feature and should not display the series of any other brand like Dell or IBM etc. Similarly if I select ProBook in series it should filter and display only Probook related models in the Model feature not the other ones.p

Negative 1104 pIm implementing in my program the gaussian blur effect. To do the job I need to render the first blur information the one on Y axis in a specific texture lets call it tex1 and use this same information contained in tex1 as input information for a second render pass for the X axis to fill an other texture lets call it tex2 containing the final gaussian blur result.p  pA good practice should be to create 2 frame buffers FBOs with a texture attached for each of them and linked both to GLCOLORATTACHMENT0 for example. But I just wonder one thingp  pIs it possible to fill these 2 textures using the same FBO p  pSo I will have to enable GLCOLORATTACHMENT0 and GLCOLORATTACHMENT1 and bind the desired texture to the correct render pass as follow p  pPseudo codep  precodeFrameBuffergtBind       FrameBuffergtGetTextureGLCOLORATTACHMENT0gtBind tex1                 BIND external texture to blur           DRAW code Y axis blur pass here...             gt Write the result in texture COLORATTACHEMENT0 tex1            FrameBuffergtGetTextureGLCOLORATTACHMENT1gtBind tex2                 BIND here first texture tex1 filled above in the first render pass           Draw code X axis blur pass here...             gt Use this texture in FS to compute the final result             within COLORATTACHEMENT1 tex2 gt The final result        FrameBuffergtUnbind codepre  pBut in my mind there is a problem because I need for each render pass to bind an external texture as an input in my fragment shader. Consequently, the first binding of the texture the colorattachment is lostp  pSo does it exist a way to solve my problem using one FBO or do I need to use 2 separate FBOs p

I have tried reactivating the previously selected cell after every click of the activex control as followsp  precodePrivate Sub checkbox1Click     previousTarget.Application.ActiveCell.Activate End Sub codepre  pand this works fine  I can click any cell and it will be selected. However, I also have an activex textbox control, and the same technique will not work in this case as the textbox needs to retain focus until another item is clicked.p  pIve determined that all this works if not using hyperlinks, so just wondering if there could be any resolution, or I have to abandon my tool tips or accept 2 clicks to select a cell after entering text in the textbox.p

Negative 1104 pPlease explain what is object level locking and class level locking. Please explain m not getting this thing.p  pObject level lockingp  pObject level locking is mechanism when you want to synchronize a nonstatic method or nonstatic code block such that only one thread will be able to execute the code block on given instance of the class. This should always be done to make instance level data thread safe. This can be done as below p  precodepublic class DemoClass      public synchronized void demoMethod   or  public class DemoClass      public void demoMethod         synchronized this                      other thread safe code                 or  public class DemoClass      private final Object lock  new Object     public void demoMethod         synchronized lock                      other thread safe code                codepre  pClass level lockingp  pClass level locking prevents multiple threads to enter in synchronized block in any of all available instances on runtime. This means if in runtime there are 100 instances of  DemoClass, then only one thread will be able to execute demoMethod in any one of instance at a time, and all other instances will be locked for other threads. This should always be done to make static data thread safe.p  precodepublic class DemoClass      public synchronized static void demoMethod   or  public class DemoClass      public void demoMethod         synchronized DemoClass.class                      other thread safe code                 or  public class DemoClass      private final static Object lock  new Object     public void demoMethod         synchronized lock                      other thread safe code                codepre  pPlease explain what is object level locking and class level locking.

Negative 1104 pMy previous question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32583742cefsharpwinformsclosetabbyjavascriptCefSharp.Winforms close tab by javascriptap  pIve implemented the interface ILifeSpanHandler to create a new tab and close it by javascript. However, the tabs opened by javascript can not be closed by javascript, it lead to closing all tabs, programs and throw a null references exception. I tried to create a new tab in another thread, and similar errors have occurred, while the tabs created by the main thread can be normally closed by window.close javascript. I realize that creating a new tab by javascript also be implemented in a particular thread. Thus, the closure by javascript of chromium webbrowser created in another thread will cause errors.

Negative 1104 pI have some relatively simple code that loops through multiple files in a folder, opens each and copies a range of data into a new worksheet.  I wrote the code using Excel 2013.  Some users have 2007 on their box.  If the 2007 users open the file from within Excel i.e FileOpen, and navigate to the directory, it runs fine.  If the 2007 users open the file from Windows Explorer, all the macros run, except the file name variable myFile that I use in the loop is always EMPTY. Its like it wont navigate to the directory.  I do not get any errors, it just executes the code and goes right to the end of the loop which says to stop when myFile is empty  then continues on with the next macro.  With Excel 2013, the program runs fine regardless of how it is opened.

Negative 1104 pI am creating a multi module project with Spring Boot for deploying my application and using gradle as my build tool.p  pNow, I am creating independent deployments for some modules in the project. Some of the project requires Embedded tomcat and some do not.

Negative 1104 pI have significant amount of data stored on my Hadoop HDFS as Parquet files I am using Spark streaming to interactively receive queries from a web server and transform the received queries into SQL to run on my data using SparkSQL.p  pIn this process I need to run several SQL queries and then return some aggregate result by merging or subtracting the results of individual queries.p  pAre there any ways I could optimize and increase the speed of the process by, for example, running queries on already received dataframes rather than the whole databasep  pIs there a better way to interactively query the Parquet stored data and give resultsp  pThank you p
Negative 1104 pI know getting microphone input has been asked many types before, but only for iOS. The Apple docs about AVFoundation only talk about iOS, so Im not sure if its even meant to be used on a mac. I have looked at CoreAudio, and most of it is deprecated, and the only docs are in ObjectiveC. I am looking for a standardlib swift solution of getting microphone samples. Does anybody have anything or is this type of stuff just not done in swiftp
