Positive 48682 hr  pWhile looking at the potential use cases for JQuery Deferred Promises, I came across Caching as one of the potential uses. That brought about the following question While using modern browsers and smart clients Jquery, any modern MVC, etc., do I even have to worry about caching anything myself I am working with MEAN stack and I am under the impression that caching does happen by default.  There is an Etag field in the headers that ensures that the server doesnt send the same information twice. The 2nd time, client will get 304 code with empty response body.  So are there any use cases out there requiring to manually implement caching on the front end  Thanksp

Positive 48682 pI have a question about ASP.NET MVC and partialview rendered by ajax. Assuming I want to write a todo list app,for now I consider 2 partial views as following just for simplicity sakep  ol liTodoListli liEditFormli ol  pHere is what I want to do page loads with an ajax call renders ToDoList partial view. as you know the list will have a  link to edit and delete records tasks. what I want is when user clicks edit an ajax call renders EditForm which is a separate partial view when they finished editing and closed the partial view dialog box the TodoList have to get updated using ajax call.p  pNow my question is how should I handle this correctly  as who is responsible for watching this change and update particular partial viewp  pWhat I was thinking was a javascript module like a controller that sits in the say the page that content all this partial viewsmanages loading of these partial views and it loads the edit partial view when edit clicked by user and waits for a promisecallback to be donewhen edit was done. Then the same module will call update on the ToDoList partial view.p  pThe reason I chose this approach is to have multiple external javascripts each has their own responsibility and less dependency on the view itself. The thing is then I should have callbacks per each event that can happen by any partial views.p  pIf you guys can help me on this or tell me if there is a better way of doing it. I googled a lot but most of the solution have a lot of dependencies between partial views which I want to avoid.p  pAny comment would be appreciated. even if you guys think this is a wrong way to do the jobp

Positive 48682 pI would like to create a promise in R programmatically. I know that the language supports it. But for some reason, there does not seem a way to do this. p  pTo give more detail I would like to have components of a list lazily evaluated. E.g.p  precodex lt listnodei, childrenpromisesomeexpensivefunctioni codepre  pI only want to access the second component of the list for very few values of the list. Prepopulating the list with lazy expressions results in very clear, compact and readable code. The background of this algorithm is a tree search. Essentially, I am trying to emulate coroutine behaviour here. Right now I am using closures for this, but the code lacks elegancy. p  pIs there a thirdparty package that exposes the hidden promise construction mechanism in R Or is this mechanism explicitly tied to environment bindings rather than expressionsp  pP.S. Yes, I am aware of delayedAssign. It does not do what I want. Yes, I can juggle around with intermediate environments, but its also messy. p

Negative 48682 pThis is mostly a theoretical question Im just very curious about. Im not trying to do this by coding it myself or anything, Im not reinventing wheels.p  pMy question is how the uppercaselowercase table of equivalence works for Unicode.p  pFor example, if I had to do this in ASCII, Id take a character, and if it falls withing the [az] range, Id sum the difference between A and a.p  pIf it doesnt fall on that range, Id have a small equivalence table for the 10 or so accented characters plus . Or, I could just have a full equivalence array with 256 entries, most of which would be the same as the inputp  pHowever, Im guessing that theres a better way of specifying the equivalences in Unicode, given that there are hundreds of thousands of characters, and that theoretically, a new language or set of characters can be added and Im expecting that you wouldnt need to patch windows when that happens.p  pDoes Windows have a huge hardcoded equivalence table for each character Or how is this implementedp  pA related question is how SQL Server implements Unicodebased accentinsensitive and caseinsensitive queries. Does it have an internal table that tells it that    E   and  are all equivalent to ep  pThat doesnt sound very fast when it comes to comparing strings.p  pHow does it access Indexes quickly Does it already index values converted to their base characters, corresponding to that fields collationp  pDoes anyone know the internals for these thingsp  pThank youp

Negative 48682 pThere are times when it makes sense to force an end of any edits that are currently being made. For instance, if the user is typing a value in a field on my document, and then clicks to the preview window, or chooses Print or Save from the menu.p  pThe problem is, by forcing an end to editing either by asking the NSWindow to make itself first responder, or by calling endEditingFor on the window, the first responder focus is no longer on the field in question. This is disruptive to the user in some situations, where the action being taken is iterative and does not signify an end to their work on the document.p  pMy first attempt at solving this is to pay attention whatever the current firstResponder is, and then to restore it after ending editing, by using NSWindows makeFirstResponder.  This works OK, but it has the undesired effect e.g. on NSTextFields of resetting the selection in the field editor to the entire length of the string contents.p  pIs there some trick I can use to force the entire system of endEditing methods to be called without disrupting the current field editor at all p  pThanks, Danielp

I am using web deployment projects and msbuild at cmd line to deploy these projects.p  pThe crux of the matter is that VirtualPathProviders are not supported for precompiled applications.  I have found a workaround for regular files a hrefhttpsunali.com20080109virtualpathproviderinprecompiledwebsites relnofollowherea.  However, this does not work for application files such as codeascxcode and codeaspxcode pages.  It throws an exception along the lines of the file has not been precompiled, and cannot be requested.p  pAs a result, I have decided to attempt to abandon precompilation altogether and take the initial request performance hit since our site traffic isnt particularly high.  However, I cant figure out how to do this using Web Deployment Projects, which are already very baked into our build process.p  [update]  pI am looking into customizing the Microsoft.WebDeployment.targets file in order to accomplish this, but I havent had any luck so far.p  [update]  pIn digging around in the Microsoft.WebDeployment.targets file, I have found that there is no straightforward way of decoupling Web Deployment projects from Web Application Precompilation.

Negative 48682 pIve been getting this exception in my code and wondered if anyone could help me out.p  pI have a Repeater Control bound to an ObjectDataSource, and the itemtemplate for the repeater contains a User Control ASCX.  This user control in turn contains several other controls, mainly a GridView that is associated with an ObjectDataSource.p  pOn initial use of the controls in this setup, everything works great  data displays properly.  However, when I change a filter option dropdowns outside of the repeater, and then rebind the Repeater, I get the exceptionp  pThe ObjectDataSource control expDataSource does not have a naming container.

The objectdatasource appears to be properly structured, and as I said, it works the first time only.p  pI noticed in the stack trace for the exception that this is occurring when ASP.NET is calling FindControl after LoadComplete occurs.  If I step through my code, it appears as though all my code is finished executing before this happens, so its all system code.p  pWhy would ASP.NET not be able to find this datasource control in the LoadComplete Handlerp  pThanksp  pOther Notesp  ul lipThis error occurs every other time.  So the first time the data loads properly, then on second refresh fails with this error.

I removed the list of SelectParameters from the bottom of the ObjectDataSource, and all of a sudden, the page does not reject the ObjectDataSource as not having a NamingContainer.

To work round this issue Im just calculating the bytes required myself, reading them, and then running the byte[] through the relevant Encoding.GetString.

Negative 48682 pIve got a slightly tricky problem to solve imagine thisp  pOne of my applications needs to make heavy use of scripting, so my idea was to provide the user a way to write script snippets and organize them in a directorylike tree structure. This is much like a source code directories with subdirectories and source files.p  pstrongData ClassesStoringstrongp  pThe first problem I come across is that I need to find a good way to store the whole tree structure on the disk, and within the application at runtime. For this I had these ideasp  ol liUse a QObject derived class which can represent the tree using QObjects parentchild features. This way I dont have to worry about deleting those objects if they parents get deleted.li liUse a simple class which may contain a QList without pointers of children and a few properties which store the properties of each groupscript.li liUse approach 2, but use pointers instead of static objects  this would avoid useless copying whenver I have to pass a group or part of a tree to a function, etc.li liUse a live backend to a SQLite or similar database, and query it at runtime. This would avoid loading the whole tree at once and keeping it in RAM.li liUse a flat file and directory structure on the file system although I think this introduces more trouble than necessary because there is no way to store meta information about objects.li ol  pstrongEditorstrongp  pThe next problem I come across is the fact that the user probably wants to edit the whole tree structure. He wants to click on a group or script, edit the script code and possibly Drag amp Drop directories and scripts around within the tree thus changing the structure of the whole tree on the way.p  pThis raises the following problemsp  ol liIf the user closes the editor, it might be a good idea to provide him a Do you want to save the changes dialog. Much like a text editor where you accidently typed something into an existing document, but you quit without saving the changes.  This would require that we edit a copy of the whole tree, and overwrite the existing tree within the application when needed.li liAllowing Drag amp Drop could be problematic... ul li... with the emstoring approach 1em currently no good way exists to change the order of children of QObjects. Also moving objects around at runtime while other parts of the program might access them is not a good idea.li li... this is easier with emstoring approach 2em, since the whole tree is handled like a single value and there are no children Id have to move and reparent. Copying a part of the tree automatically copies all children and so on. Unfortunately this would mean a lot of overhead and loss in flexibility Id have to write the whole tree onto the disk again since I cant be sure what exactly changed.li ulli ol  pIll probably update this question a little when more things come to my mind, but Im really curious how other people solve this problem. Any suggestions and ideas are appreciated. p
Negative 48682 pOn my website I have it setup where when someone clicks on one of my items, a modal JQuery dialog box pops up.

But When I go back to my original tab that had the JQuery dialog open, it is now gone How would I go about making sure the Dialog doesnt close unless someone actually clicks the little X thingy to close it p  pI assume since I used the OnClientClick, then all the action would happen userside via javascript, and not create a postback or whatever is happening. p  pEDIT In case you need to see it, the problem can be duplicated by going here a hrefhttpwww.mobiuspc.com relnofollowhttpwww.mobiuspc.coma Then click on the processor tab, then click on the 5th item down which should be AMDZ940XCGIBOX.

Not all of the items have the links, hence why I standardized to this one item for consistent tests.p

Negative 48682 pTLDR What are the proscons of using an inmemory database vs locks and concurrent data structuresp  pI am currently working on an application that has many possibly remote displays that collect live data from multiple data sources and renders them on screen in real time.  One of the other developers have suggested the use of an in memory database instead of doing it the standard way our other systems behaves, which is to use concurrent hashmaps, queues, arrays, and other objects to store the graphical objects and handling them safely with locks if necessary.  His argument is that the DB will lessen the need to worry about concurrency since it will handle readwrite locks automatically, and also the DB will offer an easier way to structure the data into as many tables as we need instead of having create hashmaps of hashmaps of lists, etc and keeping track of it all.p  pI do not have much DB experience myself so I am asking fellow SO users what experiences they have had and what are the pros amp cons of inserting the DB into the systemp

It will take significant amount of time and effort to educate him how to do the proper testing, development and apply some patterns.p  pI am ready to take responsibility for the reimplemnting the application but at the same time I dont want the main developer to be on idle but as he wont be able to significantly contribute to the betterworld project at this stage I am not sure what would the best way to keep productivity high for both of us.p  pCurrently I think following solution is good enough He proceeds doing what he does until I will catch up with him and then start working on a new project together.p  pThe problem is that of course this approach is not very productive as one developer will do betterworld project while the other will proceed with what he did, effectively doing similar tasks.p  pAnother approach would be to pair and try to do things together, but again not sure how productive we will be.p  pCan you suggest how we could better organise the work together in order to be most efficient for the overall projectp  pThanks,br Dmitriy.p
Negative 48682 pOk so Im currently working with a set of classes that I dont have control over in some pretty generic functions using these objects. Instead of writing literally tens of functions that essentially do the same thing for each class I decided to use a generic function instead.p  pNow the classes Im dealing with are a little weird in that the derived classes share many of the same properties but the base class that they are derived from doesnt. One such property example is .Parent which exists on a huge number of derived classes but not on the base class and it is this property that I need to use.p  pFor ease of understanding Ive created a small example as followsp  precodeclass StandardBaseClass   These are simulating the SMO objects  class StandardDerivedClass  StandardBaseClass          public object Parent  get set        static class Extensions                  public static object GetParentthis StandardDerivedClass sdc              return sdc.Parent                   public static object GetParentthis StandardBaseClass sbc                      throw new NotImplementedExceptionStandardBaseClass does not contain a property Parent                    This is the Generic function Im trying to write and need the Parent property.             public static void DoSomethingltTgtT foo where T  StandardBaseClass                      object Parent  Tfoo.GetParent            codepre  pIn the above example calling DoSomething will throw the NotImplemented Exception in the base classs implementation of GetParent, even though Im forcing the cast to T which is a StandardDerivedClass. p  pThis is contrary to other casting behaviour where by downcasting will force the use of the base classs implementation.p  pI see this behaviour as a bug. Has anyone else out there encountered thisp

Negative 48682 pWe have an EF4 EDMX which contains 300 entities which are used in our core product suite entities imported from database.p  pWhen we get new clients, more often than not they want to store extra information and have us develop custom processes which is outside of our business domain and completely custom. E.g. We got a contract with a security company and they wanted to store information about their security levels and have processes that act on these levels.p  pIn every case we need to add custom tables ANDOR add custom fields to existing entities. We had a good way of doing this with previous tech in which the core class libraries were not junked with custom tables etc. We simply inherited from the core entity equivilent to EntityObject in EF in a custom class library and added customisations as required.p  pSimilarly we dont want to add these custom tables and attributes to our core EDMX. We want to essentially Inherit from the core EDMX in a new custom EDMX in a seperate class library where we can add the customisations. The inheritance will allow us to do everything we can in Core EDMX plus a bit more.p  pWe are using a t4 template to generate our repositories based on this blog post We are not using modelfirst approachp  pa hrefhttpgeekswithblogs.netdanemorgridgearchive20100628entityframeworkrepositoryampunitofworkt4templateon.aspx relnofollowhttpgeekswithblogs.netdanemorgridgearchive20100628entityframeworkrepositoryampunitofworkt4templateon.aspxap  pCan we extend an EDMX like we requirep  pWe came up with one hackish solution, a method extension on core entities which returns a custom entity in seperate EDMX as in belowp  precode  public static class CoreEntityExtensions        public static EntityConnection EntityConnection      public static CustomUserEntity CustomUserDetailsthis User coreUser            ICustomUserEntityRepository customUserRepository  new CustomUserEntityRepositoryEntityConnection       return customUserRepository.All.SingleOrDefaultu gt u.id  coreUser.id         codepre  pThis isnt ideal though for a few obvious reasons.p  pAny help is much appreciated. p

Negative 48682 pExample RSS feed link a hrefhttptwitter.comstatusesusertimelinetwitter.rss relnofollowhttptwitter.comstatusesusertimelinetwitter.rssap  pDoes anyone know if Twitter limits calls to a public RSS feed This is not using an API but a simple call to a URL. p  pI am unable to find anything official or even speculative. I know the API has access limits of x requests within y minutes. I am wondering if the public RSS feeds follow a similar pattern. I am seeing behavior in a mobile app that makes me think that this may be the case.p  pDevice 1 receives an empty response while device 2 still gets updates for identical feed. Have also seen it on from my computer running a simulator for a while. Simulator stopped getting updates, then I couldnt pull up the feed in a web browser on same machine that was running the simulator. I am suspicious that Twitter is limiting RSS feed access by device. I think this because in the previous example, all RSS feeds were inaccessible form the web browser while the Twitter site was functioning properly in the same web browser.p  pThe RSS URL is being queried every 10 minutes.p  pAny insight is appreciated.p

Negative 48682 pstrongContextstrong Web app on MobileSafariiPad, both fullscreen and embedded in iframep  pstrongGoalstrong Technique that provides custom event handlers for emPressem and emTapem but strongnotstrong  emPinchem zoom or emDragem scrollpan.  We want to provide custom behavior for Press, but to let Safari handle ScrollPanZoom still.p  pstrongProblemstrong The two goals seem to be mutually exclusive.  To prevent the default behavior for a Press gesture, a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMevent.preventDefaultevent.preventDefaulta must be called in immediate response to a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarysafaridocumentationappleapplicationsreferencesafariwebcontentHandlingEventsHandlingEvents.htmlontouchstarta. However, to let the default behavior proceed on a Drag, we must strongnotstrong call event.preventDefault on the initial ontouchstart.  Once preventDefault is called, there is no way of getting the default behavior back during that gesture sequence i.e. until all fingers come off.  Drag is not recognized until some movement has occurred.p  pDrag is illustrated as the simplest example, but we care about getting the default behavior for Pinch and Doubletap as well.  We never want the default MobileSafari Press behavior of Copy Image or selecting text.p  pAttempts thus farp  ul liSave the ontouchstart event and, after a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMwindow.setTimeouttimeouta, call preventDefault on it later just before Press would be recognized.  No effect.li liListen for a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMwindow.oncontextmenuoncontextmenua.  Nope, the default Press behavior is not being signaled or routed through this event.li liPrevent the default in all of our ontouch handlers, and then when we recognize a DragPinch gesture, simulate new events using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarysafaridocumentationUserExperienceReferenceTouchEventClassReferenceTouchEventTouchEvent.htmlinitTouchEventa andor a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarysafaridocumentationUserExperienceReferenceGestureEventClassReferenceGestureEventGestureEvent.htmlinitGestureEventa.  The programmatically created events hit all of emourem callbacks, but Safari seems to pay no attention to them, triggering no default behavior.li liBreak up Safaris Press recognition with a fake move.  Safari cancels a press on the slightest move, but we allow for a bit of slop.  Simulating a move event as above just after the ontouchstart does not cause Safari to fail to recognize Press if the finger is not moved for real.li ul  pWe have a fully featured set of gesture recognizers implemented in Javascript, ontouch in the style of Apples a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationEventHandlingConceptualEventHandlingiPhoneOSGestureRecognizersGestureRecognizers.htmlnative iOS gesture recognizersa.  We have no problem recognizing any gestures, we just dont know of a good way to replicate the ZoomPanDoubletap behavior that Safari provides for free.p  pWe dont need code were looking for any theoretical solution beyond just implement panzoom yourself too, though if you have a slick way of doing that were interested that leads to reasonable success.  Were also interested in learning about other similar attempts to do this  emsurely we cant have been the first to try thisemp  pstrongAlternate TLDRstrong Is there any way to prevent a default Press also known as tapandhold other than in touchstartp

I am doing the update via an ajax call to a php page.

When i have used an codealertcode inside of the codeupdateUserDatecode function before to verify that i can see the variables and they all have the right data you can see the code i used to do this is commented out.  However, whenever i try and use the variables with jQuery as you see on the 6th line of the code.  It doesnt do anything.

Negative 48682 pI have the need to create a system to store python data structures on a linux system but have concurrent read and write access to the data from multiple programsdaemonsscripts.  My first thought is I would create a unix socket that would listen for connections and serve up requested data as pickled python data structures.

This ensures only a single process reads and writes to the data.p  pThe other idea is to just keep the pickled data structure on disk and only allow a single process access through a lockfile or token...

First time around, it just adds WWWAuthenticate NTLM to the header. The client responsds with NTLM emsome token stringem. At this point Cassini takes this string, and uses it to call the underlying AcceptSecurityContext WinAPI call. That generates another token string, which is in turn sent back to the client. The client then sends back another encrypted token string and Cassini then passes that off to the AcceptSecurityContext method again. At this point in the Cassini app, the authentication succeeds, and were all good.p  pIve tried reproducing this in my Module, but for some reason, on the final handshake, I fail to authenticatep  precodepublic class TestModule  IHttpModule      public void Dispose                public void InitHttpApplication context              context.BeginRequest  new EventHandlercontextBeginRequest           void contextBeginRequestobject sender, EventArgs e              var context  HttpContext.Current         var headers  context.Request.Headers         if String.IsNullOrEmptyheaders.GetAuthorization                      context.Response.StatusCode  401             context.Response.AddHeaderWWWAuthenticate, NTLM                  else                      Step2context                      private void Step2HttpContext httpContext              using var auth  new NtlmAuth                      var header  httpContext.Request.Headers[Authorization].Substring5             var result  auth.Authenticateheader third time around, this returns false.

Negative 48682 pI have a maybe stupid question but I need to ask it p  pMy Friendly URL furl database design approach is fairly summarized in the following diagram strongInnoDBstrong at strongMySQL 5.5strong usedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8OYy2.png altdiagramp  pEach item will generate as many furls as languages available on the website. The furlredirect table represents the controller path for each item. I show you an examplep  precodeitem.id  1000 item.title  Example title furlredirect  item1000 furl.url  enexampletitle1000 furl.url  esexampletitle1000 furl.url  itexampletitle1000 codepre  pWhen you insert a new item, its furlredirect and furls must be also inserted. The problem appears becouse of the necessary unique constraint in the furl table. As you see above, in order to get unique urls, I use the title of the item it is not necessarily unique  the id to create the unique url. That means the order of inserting rows should be as followp  precode1. Insert item  and get the id of the new item inserted ERROR furlredirectid must not be null 2. Insert furlredirect  need the item id to create de path 3. Insert furl  need the item id to create de url codepre  pI would like an strongelegant solutionstrong to this problem, but I can not get itp  pIs there a way of getting the strongnext AutoIncrement valuestrong on an InnoDB Table, and is it recommended to use it Can you think of another way to ensure the stronguniqueness of the friendly urlsstrong that is independent of the items id Am I missing something crucialp  pAny solution is welcomep  pThanksp
Negative 48682 pWe have 2 web servers and 1 app server in our QA environment. Each of them hosts a Membase service. For simplicity lets call the web servers web01 and web02. Both running IIS.p  pTo access Membase we use the .Net client a hrefhttpmemcached.enyim.com relnofollowhttpmemcached.enyim.comap  pThe problem were encountering here is that web01 can access Membase, set and get values without any issues, any and every time. However web02 cant seem to access Membase from our web application.p  pWe wrote a test console app and ran it from the web02 server and it worked just fine.p  pWeve even tried to Telnet into the url and port we have in the web02 config and that worked.p  pThe Membase configuration values are definied in the machine.config file.

Negative 48682 pAlthough tools like codeRUnitcode, codesvUnitcode, and codetestthatcode are good for package developers, I think it would be useful to have some means of uploading test scripts or even just usage examples for particular packages.

Negative 48682 pIve got a table called emusersem.  Two of the fields in that table are emactivationem and emregdateem.  Both are VARCHAR.  The emactivationem field contains the string active if the user has activated the account.  If the user has not activated the account, the field contains a string which is a randomized alphanumerical activation key.  The emregdateem field contains the date and time that the user registered the account, populated by codedatem.d.y Hmscode.p  pWhat I need to do is create a PHP script which will delete all records that do NOT equal active in the activation field and are older than an amount of time that I specify.  I know how to locate records by matching criteria such as selecting records where activation equals active, but I would need it to do the opposite.  I would need it to match all records where activation does not equal active because the randomized string would be impossible to match, would it not.p  pOf course, I would then have to also compare the selected records to the current time based on those records regdate field.p  pSo, in short, Ive got a bunch of records and I want to delete all of the ones that are older than a certain amount of time and have a field that does NOT equal active.p  pI apologize if I did not explain this well enough.

Negative 48682 pIm having an issue with my progress bar. Now I have looked through all of the questions in overflow and Ive been through alot of google searching. I may have overlooked something, but Ill bet you anything this problem is something really simply I keep overlooking. Heres the deal.p  pMy progress bar seems to work just fine. Im using ajax, everything is in the right panel, it fires immediatly when the button is pushed and actually it stops once the process is completed although I have no idea how I did that. Please note, this is as simple as it gets. Its just a GIF, nothing special. Using Visual Studio 2010, SQL Server 2008, Ajax, and C. Im not using a jquery or js, although I may have too. p  pMy application is simple. It sends orders to a different server, so I am on the client side. Once the button is clicked, the orders are in the process of being sent. My Problem is, although the orders are being sent, when the progress bar stops, and the process is done, my labels success or error and order database tables do not fire. Why is this I find this very odd because the application sends the orders, it functions 100, but nothing changes on the user side. p  pHere is some code, if you need more then just say the word.

Negative 48682 pI have a project where I want to show a specific div about the company while a large fullscreen jQuery cycle is loading.

If you use the cycle to move to the next slide the next image is not loaded yet. I deduced that it must not be preloading correctly.p  pHeres my code.

Negative 48682 pWhen running on a touchscreen device iPhone, in my case, but I presume it does this on others, when the virtual keyboard pops up for a form field, there are added navigation buttons at the top of the keyboard previous, next, done. And sometimes autofill.p  pThis is apparently the Mobile Safari form assistant.p  pI find this redundant, superfluous, and confusing. iPhone users arent used to this in native apps, and its unnecessary. Its a touch device. You touch what you want to change. Theres no need for navigation buttonsp  pI suppose users may be familiar with this, IF they use their device often to fill forms on websites. Ive had an iPhone since the 3G, and never noticed this. I dont think Ive ever filled a form on Mobile Safari I would use my desktop...p  pThe form assistant is there for navigating forms on websites, which might not be designed appropriately for a mobile device. So, in that context it serves a useful purpose.p  pBut when using JQuery Mobile, you ARE designing an interface for use on a touchscreen mobile device. There shouldnt be a need for the form assistant. I find it particularly annoying in a local app PhoneGap, Rhodes, etc..p  pIve done some searches, and havent come up with a solution.p  pDoes anybody know how to turn this offp

Negative 48682 pIm feeling a bit lost with my question about HTML5 code generation, and despite having put some efforts into my research I dont really feel much wiser.p  pI use VS2010 for the creation of ASP.NET pages, and I do know that there is an unofficial a hrefhttpwww.hanselman.comblogAnnouncingTheWebStandardsUpdateHTML5SupportForTheVisualStudio2010Editor.aspx relnofollowWeb Standards Updatea for VS2010 SP1. Using this update I can change the settings of the Target Schema for Validation in the ASPX editor window to HTML5. The new elements  tags and semantics are then available via Intellisense, and I can nicely code away manually using all the fancy new stuff.p  pWhat I dont understand is how to get something like the ASP.NET controls to generate HTML5 code where it makes sense. Is this at all possible or am I completely going in the wrong direction here I would have expected that I do not have to hand code HTML5 as long as I use the existing controls which tend to generate a lot of JavaScript in the background when the page is delivered to the clients browser.p  pThanks in advance for a clarifying answerp  pG.p
Negative 48682 pIm about to loose it soon... I have two apps with working background tasks that are updating the live tile.

The first onetwo days both live tiles for my apps are updating every 28 minutes like clockwork. But then they start skipping updates.

Negative 48682 pI just asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8903400whyareunhandledexceptionsthrowninwin32timercallbacksnottreatedasunhathis questiona. In short, when you throw from a win32 timer callback, the exception doesnt appear to go anywhere. It seems to be surreptitiously handled by Windows somewhere.p  pOK well thats a problem. The OTHER side of the problem is that destructors dont seem to be getting called when this exception IS thrown. In the following code, for the codestdvectorcode of CFoo, the only time CFoo is output is when the temporaries in GetFooVect are destructed and when the rValue is copied to fooVect. The contents of fooVect are NOT destructed.p  pThis is my worst nightmare. I use RAII pretty heavily. I lean pretty heavily on my destructors to cleanup appropriately.p  precodeclass CFoo  public     CFoo printfFUNCTION n   stdvectorlt CFoo gt GetFooVect      stdvectorlt CFoo gt rValue     rValue.pushbackCFoo     rValue.pushbackCFoo     rValue.pushbackCFoo     return rValue   VOID CALLBACK TimerHWND hwnd,     UINT uMsg,     UINTPTR idEvent,     DWORD dwTime       My destructors arent called     stdvectorlt CFoogt fooVect  GetFooVect       Im destroyed     CFoo aFoo      throw FooExcept     printfAlso Heren  codepre  pIve tried recreating this by simply throwingcatching C exceptions ie removing the win32 timer callback variable and the vector of CFoos destructs just fine. For some reason, destructors are NOT being called here for things in vectors. What gives Is there a logical explanation for this, or is it just weird, or bothp

Negative 48682 pstrongCan I get a little help with thisstrongp  pIn a test project, I have an codeAUSampler gt MixerUnit gt ioUnitcode and have a render callback set up. It all works. I am using the codeMusicDeviceMIDIEventcode method as defined in codeMusicDevice.hcode to play a midi noteOn amp noteOff. So in the hack test code below, a noteOn occurs for .5 sec. every 2 seconds.p  pcodeMusicDeviceMIDIEventcode below takes a param codeinOffsetSampleFramecode in order to schedule an event at a future time. What I would like to be able to do is play a noteOn and schedule the noteOff at the same time without the hack time check I am doing below. I just dont understand what the codeinOffsetSampleFramecode value should be ex to play a .5 sec or .2 second note. in other words, I dont understand the basics of audio timing....p  pSo, if someone could walk me through the arithmetic to get proper values from the incoming codeAudioTimeStampcode, that would be great Also perhaps correct meclarify any of thesep  ol lipcodeAudioTimeStampgtmSampleTimecode  sampleTime is the time of the current sample slice Is this in millisecondspli lipcodeAudioTimeStampgtmHostTimecode    host is the computer the app is running on and this is  time in milliseconds since computer started This is a strongHUGEstrong number.

Thanks for bearing with mep  blockquote   pstronginOffsetSampleFramestrong                   If you are scheduling the MIDI Event from the audio units render thread, then you can supply a                        sample offset that the audio unit may apply when applying that event in its next audio unit render.                        This allows you to schedule to the sample, the time when a MIDI command is applied and is particularly                        important when starting new notes. If you are not scheduling in the audio units render thread,                        then you should set this value to 0p blockquote  p MusicDeviceMIDIEvent function defp  precodeextern OSStatus MusicDeviceMIDIEvent   MusicDeviceComponent    inUnit,                     UInt32                  inStatus,                     UInt32                  inData1,                     UInt32                  inData2,                     UInt32                  inOffsetSampleFrame codepre  pmy callbackp  precodeOSStatus  MyCallback   void                           inRefCon,                  AudioUnitRenderActionFlags    ioActionFlags,                  const AudioTimeStamp          inTimeStamp,                  UInt32                         inBusNumber,                  UInt32                         inNumberFrames,                  AudioBufferList               ioData   Float64 sampleTime  inTimeStampgtmSampleTime UInt64 hostTime  inTimeStampgtmHostTime  [bridge AudioinRefCon audioEventsampleTime andHostTimehostTime]  return 1    codepre  p OBJC methodp  precode voidaudioEventFloat64 sampleTime andHostTimeUInt64hostTime  OSStatus result  noErr  Float64 nowTime  sampleTimeself.graphSampleRate  sample rate 44100.0 if nowTime  lastTime gt 2       UInt32 noteCommand     kMIDIMessageNoteOn ltlt 4  0     result  MusicDeviceMIDIEvent mySynthUnit, noteCommand, 60, 120, 0      lastTime  sampleTimeself.graphSampleRate   if nowTime  lastTime gt .5      UInt32   noteCommand   kMIDIMessageNoteOff ltlt 4  0     result  MusicDeviceMIDIEvent mySynthUnit, noteCommand, 60, 0, 0   codepre

Being the fact that all the client wants to do is one off calls retrieve a data set, update a data set, delete a data set than once it has finished its call the memory it used to do the action should be relinquished. This is not the case at all I gather there is some caching happening or maybe the calling instance is not being disposed.p  pCan anybody steer me in the right direction so the w3wp is lean and blows the memory away after the call has completed.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 48682 pMy site requires users to input a great deal of mathematical and scientific notation.  Naturally, I need a way to store this serverside for future use.  This is my ideal course of action  a user inputs a chunk of text, potentially with or without mathematical symbols, the input is submitted, it is then turned into a format that is suitable for a database, and finally, on every subsequent viewing of the inputted math, it should get converted to MathML.  The MathML is converted to a readable format by MathJax.p  pI have never worked with storing math in a database before, and the fact that I want to allow users to be able to insert math inline with text creates a few implications.

Negative 48682 pI have developed a small installer target net 3.5 client profile and I have two issues.p  ol liBecause this is done with .Net 3.5 Framework and one of my target systems is XP, I have to check if .Net 3.5 Framework is installed or not before I can run the program. So, I used InnoSetup to check and install the framework if so. Im not sure if this was the best way to go. I wonder if someone will give me some better option in regard to InnoSetup choice. Ive tried windows scripting .vbs but in one of my tests, on XP station, this .vbs file could not run because this type of files were not associated with Wscript.exe so, I give up from this option.li liThere are few assembly files dll that my project uses and, by default, they were dumped to debugrelease folders when I compile the project. However I have used some other assembly files that I load dynamically and invoke methods and properties through reflection. I manually, hard coded those files locations relative to my exe files. So, if I have my exe file in a CD D then my program will look for a folder DBin. For win7 it will look for DBinWin7 and for XP it will look for DBinXP folders etc. My program uses three common assemblies described at the beginning that I loaded through Add References before I compile my project and, as I said, VS dumped them into debugrelease folders. What I actually needed is to have these files in my Bin folder so my setup.exe file will be alone with config.ini file in the root directory of the CD nice and clean. What I needed is to tell somehow to VS that I need my assemblies to be in the Bin folder inside the output folder debugrelease. If this is possible then I can COPY my executable with the Bin folder and make CD which is my final goal.li ol  pAny better ideas on these two issues tnxp

They should be put between the main screen rendering process and the GUI overpainting, this is why I included it in this question.li ul  pI see a problem when I implement the overpainting using a special shader program I cant access the pixels behind the GUI to apply some effects like gaussian blur to make the GUI look like glass. strongI would have to render the scene to another buffer instead of on the QGLView.

My basic goal is to allow for multiple table like objects which will store and control data objects. While each data object will share some things in common, there will be some distinct differences which the table will control and work with. For example, one table might have data objects which have a name parameter, and so the table will provide a function which prints a list of all the names of the data it holds. This way I can have generic code which works with all of these table objects, and specialized code which operates only with one type of table.p

Negative 48682 pSo I had to create a bit of code that would make a list and do various things to it. Specifically print it, sort it, and see if a value were in it. Did that, ran fine. Now Ive got to take those functions and split them up into separate files, then use gcc c which Im not super sure Im using correctly to get .o files, plus a .o for the test program. Then I have to use gcc to link my .o files together into an executable.

The problem could be how to remove the day part 18 from the long format  I tried using the method codeformatDate date, StringBuffer toAppendTo, FieldPosition poscode, but this allows only extracting the number part, not the extra character.p  pThe pattern of the codeDateFormat.getInstanceDateFormat.LONG, Locale.SIMPLIFIEDCHINESEcode is codeyyyyMdcode. Extracting the day part would yield codeyyyyMcode. It seems to me that its not possible to use Javas DateFormat standard to achieve this since the extra characters codecode, codecode and codecode do not seem mapped to the corresponding field, but are simply characters without other semantic for the formatter.p  pI had a look to codeDateFormatSymbolscode and codeLocaleServiceProvidercode, but think it doesnt help. To me, the point of extension would be adding another date style to the codegetInstanceint stylecode method. But it doesnt seem possible without implementing it for all the Locale...p  pIs this analysis correct  How to achieve this formatting in a clean way p

Negative 48682 pIve been searching the past three days for a builtin, hardwareaccelerated way of bluring a bitmap with android. I stumbled upon certain workarounds like shrinking the bitmap and scaling it up again, but this method produced low quality results which were not suitable for my image recognition requirements. I also read that implementing convolution with shaders or JNI is a good way to go, but I cannot believe that there is no builtin solution in the Android framework for this very common purpose. Currently Ive ended up with a selfwritten convolution implementation in Java, but it is awkwardly slow. My question isp  ul liIs there emreally no builtin solutionem in the Android frameworkli liIn case there is none what is the most efficient way of accelerating the convolution with a still reasonable complexity of implementation and maintenance Shall we use JNI, shaders or something completely differentli ul
Negative 48682 pIm reading thinking in c chapter 6 initialization amp cleanup. The author said that p  blockquote   pIts actually more likely that the compiler will follow the practice   in C of allocating all the storage for a scope at the opening brace of   that scope. It doesnt matter because, as a programmer, you cant   access the storage until it has been defined. Although the storage is   allocated at the beginning of the block, the constructor call doesnt   happen until the sequence point where the object is defined because   the identifier isnt available until then. The compiler even checks to   make sure that you dont put the object definition where the sequence   point only conditionally passes through it, such as in a switch   statement or somewhere a goto can jump past it.p blockquote  pAnd then the author gives an example as followingp  precodeclass X  public   X   XX   void fint i    ifi lt 10      goto jump1  Error goto bypasses init      X x1   Constructor called here  jump1   switchi      case 1        X x2   Constructor called here       break    case 2   Error case bypasses init       X x3   Constructor called here       break       int main    f9   f11  codepre  pI dont understand why the above code is OK According to my understanding, codex2code can be bypassed initialization if codeicode is not code1code.p  pemstrongSupplementemstrongp  pThis sentence Ita actually more likely that the compiler will follow the practice in C of allocating all the storage for a scope at the opening brace of that scope. also confused me.p  pAccording to the authors description, at the opening brace of the codeswitchcode, the compiler has already allocated space for codex2code and codex3code.

We will invest time only if its universal even after a year or so as its not  worth time for a single manufacturer.

Negative 48682 pHi I am just learning WCF and I am trying to implement a WCF service on a dummy project I am working on and I wana do this right.p  pMy project contains a DataAccess project that has an entity framework repository that is resposible for accesing data in the database.This is how the model and interface look likep  precodepublic partial class BookModel      public int Id  get set      public string Name  get set      public string Author  get set      public string Description  get set      public DateTime PublicationDate  get set      public int CategoryId  get set      public decimal Price  get set      public string BookUrl  get set    public interface IBookRepository      IEnumerableltBookModelgt GetBooksint pageNumber, int numberOfBooksOnPage     IEnumerableltBookModelgt GetBookByCategoryint categoryId, int pageNumber, int numberOfBooksOnPage     BookModel GetBookByIdint bookId     int CountBooks     int CountBooksByCategoryint categoryId     void AddBookBookModel book     void UpdateBookBookModel book     void DeleteBookint bookId  codepre  pNow when I implement the wcf service I have to define the service contrat and the data contract.The thing is that this two are exact duplicates of my curent model and repository , so I am not really sure what to do.p  pThis is what I have so far but I am not sure this is the right wayp  precode[DataContract] public class Book      [DataMember]     public int Id  get set       [DataMember]     public string Name  get set       [DataMember]     public string Author  get set       [DataMember]     public string Description  get set       [DataMember]     public DateTime PublicationDate  get set       [DataMember]     public int CategoryId  get set       [DataMember]     public decimal Price  get set       [DataMember]     public string BookUrl  get set    [ServiceContract] interface IBookService      [OperationContract]     IEnumerableltBookgt GetBooksint pageNumber, int numberOfBooksOnPage      [OperationContract]     IEnumerableltBookgt GetBookByCategoryint categoryId, int pageNumber, int numberOfBooksOnPage      [OperationContract]     Book GetBookByIdint bookId      [OperationContract]     int CountBooks      [OperationContract]     int CountBooksByCategoryint categoryId      [OperationContract]     void AddBookBook book      [OperationContract]     void UpdateBookBook book      [OperationContract]     void DeleteBookint bookId  codepre  pIs it a good Ideea to move the model and repository into the wcf servicep  pOr should I create duplicates for this two classes in my wcf project that just call the methods from the repositoryp

Negative 48682 pIm working out an implementation of a hrefhttpscode.google.compelmah relnofollowELMAHa in a web application that logs exceptions to a SQL Server. Thats inconsequential, however. My goal is to include the strongapplication namestrong in the log so I can easily identify the offending application at a glance when checking error reports. Ive searched far and wide spending hours trying to find a solution. Ive included codeApplication Name[myApp]code in my SQL Server connection string, but that only helps me to identify the app during a SQL Server trace and not in my actual error logging.p  pHas anyone done this Here is an example of a log record in my database. I would like to see the Application Name listed as well.

Negative 48682 pIm trying to use a Flask application behind an Amazon Load Balancer and the Flask threads keep timing out. It appears that the load balancer is sending a codeConnection keepalivecode header and this is causing the Flask process to never return or takes a long time. With gunicorn in front the processes are killed and new ones started. We also tried using uWSGI and simply exposign the Flask app directly no wrapper. All result in the Flask process just not responding.p  pI see nothing in the Flask docs which would make it ignore this header. Im at a loss as to what else I can do with Flask to fix the problem.p  pemCurl and direct connections to the machine work fine, only those via the load balancer are causing the problem. The load balancer itself doesnt appear to be doing anything wrong and we use it successfully with several other stacks.emp
Negative 48682 pSo I have this function where I am generating and returning my image a .bmp format. I want to put it into a word document. I looked at codeInlineShapes.AddPicturecode but it only takes a codestringcode argument, which requires me to save the picture physically and then give the path of the picture as parameter to the AddPicture, which I dont want.

Negative 48682 pHow does Java deal with GC and Heap Allocation on multiprocessor machinesp  pIn the reading Ive done, there doesnt seem to be any difference in the algorithms used between single and multiprocessor systems. The art amp science of GC tuning is Java seems fairly mature, yet I cant find anything related to this in any of the common JVM implementations. p  pAs a data point, in .Net, the algorithm changes significantly Theres a heap affinitized to each processor, and each processor is responsible for that heap. This is documented in a number of places such as a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinebb985011.aspx relnofollowMSDNap  blockquote   pScalable Collections On a multiprocessor system running the server   version of the execution engine MSCorSvr.dll, the managed heap is   split into several sections, one per CPU. When a collection is   initiated, the collector has one thread per CPU all threads collect   their own sections simultaneously. The workstation version of the   execution engine MSCorWks.dll doesnt support this feature.p blockquote  pAny insight that can be offered into Java GC tuning specifically for multi processor systems is also of interest to me. p

Negative 48682 pI have a list of inlineblock elements that wrap to form several rows. Id like to display a div element between on of the rows, depending on where a specific element is located. For example, the first few rows are numberedp  pimg srchttpi43.tinypic.com2zxw9jt.jpg altnumbered inlineblock elementsp  pIf I wanted to target the third element and display a full length element 100 of the div containing the blocks, then it would look like thisp  pimg srchttpi39.tinypic.comqsr51h.jpg altbetween first and second rowsp  pThe position of the fulllength div would be the same for any of the blocks 15. Or, if another block was targeted, like 7 or 8, it would look likep  pimg srchttpi43.tinypic.comj14lua.jpg altbetween second and third rowsp  pNotice how the rows are shifted down. I understand how to do this with blocklevel elements, but not in between rows of wrapped inlineblock elements. The rows that each of the numbered blocks would be on would change as the browser window width changes, and the fulllength div would know which row to be positioned beneath.p  pHow would someone go about placing the div below that particular row of elements Is it possible with some kind of relative or absolute position with CSS Could the row position change dynamically as the blocks are reordered with window width changesp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Here is a a hrefhttpcdpn.ioAiIzfcodepena that has the blocks and the inserted div. The div is styled to be absolutely positioned, and can be moved to the appropriate position by inserting it after the desired block element tag, but I still cant get the row beneath it to make room and slide down.p

The problem is, that the png files are too small I want to put them into one paper using LaTex and the codeanimategraphicscode command, but it is to pixely not sharp.p  pIf I click on the fullscreen icon in the rgl device, so that the R plot is larger, this does help and everything works. The problem is, that there is too much white space around it. With this white space above, below, left and right to it I cannot include it in LaTex, because it does not fit because of its big size width, height. I have 200 png files, so manually removing the white space with paint is not a nice work.p  pThe small pictures look like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com04Z7H.png altsc11p  pThe following happens, if you zoom in this is, what LaTex does, when I put it into my paper, it increases the picture, screenshot is from my LaTex file.

Also you can already see the problem with the large files with too much white space The small picture with some white space above already destroys my title.p  pSo how could I solve this problem How can I tell R to use the fullscreen plots but without so much white space around it When I click on fullscreen and save those pictures everything is fine, except the white space around it.p  pHere is the png file with too much white space around it in this screenshot there is no white space below, but when I use the correct zoom it is therep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comilOqB.png altsc2p  pOne further note This is the R code I use to save the png filesp  precodeM lt par3duserMatrix movie3d spin3drpm3, duration20,dirCtestmovie, cleanFALSE  play3d spin3drpm3, duration20 codepre

Negative 48682 pI created an android application which connects to a Windows Azure mobile service. I followed the steps as is from the tutorial on the Windows Azure site.

Does chrome developer tools exposes some kind of API that lets me do that In other words Is there some way to control the dev tools debugger from javascript code that is being executed in a normal web pagep  pAny direction on the subject is appreciated, even if I have to write a custom chrome extension to achieve that.p
Negative 48682 pIm working on a mini html5 game and Ive stumbled upon an interesting problem, for me at least. And thats how to write the formulas for spells. For examplep  pcodeSpellOne  baseDmg  leveldmgPerLvl  ratiosomeStatcodep  pthat would be only one formula, but my point is, obviously if I write it like that it will calculate the damage from the start and SpellOne will become just a number, not a formula anymore. I can only think of two ways to do it, please lend me your help and give me any advice you have on this.p  precodeSpellOne.baseDmg  50 SpellOne.dmgPerLvl  30 SpellOne.baseCd  15  cd  spell cooldown SpellOne.CdPerLvl  2  cd decreases by 2 every level SpellOne.baseCost  50  mana or whatever resource SPellOne.CostPerLvl  20  increases by 20 each level codepre  pand then once the player uses the spell it calculates the latest updatep  precodeSpellOneDamage  baseDmg  leveldmgPerLevel  codepre  pThe other method I have is something that came to me recently. I have around 100 heroes, each with like a dozen stats and then several spells that also have their own stats. But only 1 or 2 heroes will be loaded ever at one time, so am I wasting resources or adding to many useless variables to the dom tree Since only 1 of them are being used Which made me think of the following solutionp  pMake each hero one long function, and when a person changes their hero, it runs the function and for example the currentHero variable takes upon itself ALL the stats from the hero, spell stats too. So when the person changes heroes again, all thats really happening is currentHero variable changes its values and thus you wont have to load ALL the hero stats pointlessly It only loads a hero when selected. Any suggestions you guys have are greatly appreciated, thank you in advancep

Yet, I wonder if there is not a way to get it to work.p  pBasically, I would like to randomly draw from a distribution and only keep those who respect a certain condition and fill a predetermined storage matrix and stop once the matrix is full.p  pSince these are draw, I suppose I can harness Matlabs parallel capabilities but since the completion of the storage matrix depends on the sequence of draws, I feel there is an issue there.p  pAlternatively, is there a way to use a timecheck for the problem at hand. For instance, I would use a parfor with a limit absurdely large but include a way to check the size of the storage matrix at frequent interval.p  pIn pseudocode, it would givep  ul licreate size of the storage matrix codeAzeros100,1 Naccepted0Ntried0codeli liinitiate the for loop codeparfor i1100000000000codeli lido the loop codexirandn1,1codeli licheck whether it respects the condition codeif xigt0, NacceptedNaccepted1 NtriedNtried1 Aj,1xi, else NtriedNtried1codeli liCheck with a timer every 5 minutes that I have no clue as to implement it in Matlab if the size of codeAcode has reached 100 or not.

Since codexcode is a lvalue, it can be bound to a lvalue reference of the same type, i.e., a lvalue reference of type codeintampampcode. Such a lvalue reference would be defined asp  precodeintampamp amp refx  x  nonworking code, just for the sake of explanation codepre  pOf course, it is not possible to explicitly define a reference to a reference, and the correct way to perform the binding is as followsp  precodeintamp refx  x codepre  pC Primer reports the following about using references as initializersp  blockquote   pwhen we use a reference as an initializer, we are really using the   object to which the reference is boundp blockquote  pOn the other hand, the lvalue reference must match the type of the lvalue expression. What am I missing Is reference collapsing involved in this casep  pThanks.p

Negative 48682 pI have a table view with static cells. One cell contains a codeUITextViewcode and the codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode is calculated dynamically so that the cell is always tall enough to accomodate the text that part took some work under iOS 7, actually, as its no longer possible to simply ask the textView for its codecontentSizecode.p  pWhen I tap within the text view to start editing, the keyboard animates into place, the contentInsets on the tableView are automatically adjusted to account for this ie, bottom inset of 216px for iPhone portrait orientation, the cursor  caret becomes visible, and then the table view emscrolls to another locationem. It ends up looking like a bounce.p  pHeres a video of this in the simulator a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshtdbb0t7985u6n4textviewbounce.movhttpswww.dropbox.comshtdbb0t7985u6n4textviewbounce.movap  pNotice that for a second the caret is just above the keyboard.

Negative 48682 pI need to capture 192 kHz audio for some bioacoustics experiments using Python 3. I have the hardware, a Sound Devices USBPre 2 sound card, a microphone with good frequency response curve up to 100 kHz, and I have enabled my os ubuntu 13.04 to sample from this card at 192 kHz.p  pI have tried recording with PyAudio. It appears to work, and will give me a wav file with a sampling rate of 192 kHz. However, when I look at the spectra there is no power above 24 kHz, suggesting that PyAudio doesnt really capture at 192 kHz, but rather at 48 kHz. However, when I record using Audacity with input from JACK, I get a nice recording with power up to 96kHz. So, I have the impression that PyAudio doesnt actually sample the sound at 192 kHz even though it should be able to.

I get eth0 as a NAT type inteface that connects to the internet via DHCP and eth1 as a static IP with which I can connect to from the virtualbox host I just need to add a private subnet to the virtualbox settings. However when I package this VM and try to deploy it as a box from vagrant strongI am unable to get eth1 to be brought up automatically as the MAC address gets changed by Vagrantstrong which means the static network configuration wont apply to itp  pBy default on vagrant the first adapter is always set as a NATed interfance. This means I dont need to actually add anything in the vagrantfile for eth0. p  pFor eth1 Ive added the following in the Vagrantfilep  pconfig.vm.network privatenetwork,ip192.168.100.201,mac  080027df863a, adapter  2p  pstrongThe problemstrong when I boot the vm vagrant up a strongnew MAC is assignedstrong for eth1.

If Ive understood it, everytime the factorial function is called, a new stack frame is added to the stack...each frame allocates 8 bytes into the stack and each new frame contains a return address to return to the procedure that called it..If Im understanding that correctly, Im having difficulty seeing it in code.p

Negative 48682 pI have written my own container class whose original internal data structure was the stl list. I then needed to create my own doubly linked list. I have now implemented my own doubly linked list as well as my own iterator for the linked list, but Im having problems getting it to behave like the stl list, particularly with the begin and end.p  pFrom what I understand, begin should point the first node, and end should point one element past the last element. I need to make sure that when I call end that I can decrement back to the valid last element. I also need to make sure that I can do your normal traversals like...p  precodewhile beg  end   do something beg  codepre  pEssentially my linked list just uses nodes that contain a data element, a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node.p  pWhen I first tried to implement my end, I just had the last nodes next pointer be a nullptr.

Negative 48682 pIn my software where template metaprogramming is used a lot, template classes often take class templates as arguments which define certain aspects of their behavior. As a very simple example, suppose we have a class codeFormulaUsercode which needs to use a formula to calculate a number from two other numbers, and the particular formula must be specified as a template parameter. Further, the formula needs to be open in regard to which data type it operates upon float or double. For examplep  precodetemplate lttemplatelttypenamegt class Formula, typename FpTypegt struct FormulaUser     using TheFormula  FormulaltFpTypegt     void somefunction             FpType x  1        FpType y  2        FpType result  TheFormulacalculatex, y       template lttypename FpTypegt struct AddFormula      static FpType calculate FpType x, FpType y  return x  y     composition using TheFormulaUser  FormulaUserltAddFormula, floatgt codepre  pThis is OK, but not so much when a formula itself needs to have parameters defined before being passed to the codeFormulaUsercode. For example, a codeLinearFormulacode lets ignore the fact that floating point types cant be template parametersp  precodetemplate ltfloat A, float B, float Cgt struct LinearFormula      template lttypename FpTypegt     struct Formula          static FpType calculate FpType x, FpType y  return A  Bx  Cy          composition using TheFormulaUser  FormulaUserltLinearFormulalt1.0, 2.0, 3.0gttemplate Formula, floatgt codepre  pWhat I dont like about this code isp  ul liComposition is ugly the codetemplate Formula partcode.li liThe meat of the codeLinearFormulacode is indented twice.li ul  pIs there any way to make it nicerp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe reason I wish to split the formula parameters into two levels the formula constants and the FpType is that those in the first set are part of user configuration, while those in the second set are provided by the class that is making use of the Formula. Well, the FpType  also ends up as user configuration, but it should be the same for all formulas. This more complex composition demonstrates this...p  precodeusing MyProgram  Programlt     float,  FpType     AddFormula,  Formula for something     LinearFormulalt2.0, 5.3, 5.3gt,  Formula for something else     QuadraticFormulalt.....gt,  For something else...     ExponentialAveraginglt  AveragingType         0.6  SmoothingFactor     gt gt codepre  pSo you give the FpType to the root class, and it is propagated to everything else.p  pThese examples are artifical but they should explain the problem. I dont want the configuration to have any more boilerplate than necessary in particular, the float constants cant really be specified as above....p  pFinally, it is a requirement that template metaprogramming be used both for performance reasons as well as consistency with the existing code.p

Negative 48682 pi am trying to find a way to change bitmaps per frame on a surfaceview loop. I am stuck on the resource id.  i cannot find a way to loop through a series of images.p  pI am an artist and animator trying to learn android.  The concepts are completely foreign to me to make a bitmap resource change after a loop.  I dont have any code yet.  I am trying to learn the concept.  i can get an app compiled, running, and onto my phone to display a bitmap on a surfaceview.  are there any examples changing the resource id through a loopframe to display a new frame after each loop.  I want a sequence of ships to animate.  I understand the concepts of canvas, onDraw, onDestoyed, etc.  I just need to grasp the concept of frame through the cycle.  i am new to java and android.  I know there has to be a simple loop that will frame a current frame bitmap to the next in a sequence.  I know it has to do with the resource id, but fitting it all together in my brain is not working.  There are many examples of rotating single bitmaps, changing position x y.  I have searched for a tutorial that can frame a variable in a bitmap array to use as a resource id.  I like programming but my artist brain is not grasping the new concepts very well.  Thanks.  I have since learned that the resource id is a variable.  But, what does that mean to me          Artist in a digital frontierp

Essentially, I want each page to use the same layout, header menu, and footer the only difference between each page will be the stuff inside the contentcontainer. This is a simplified version of what Im working with right now p  precodeltphp content  htmlspecialcharsGET[contenturl]gt  ltbodygt     ltdiv idmaincontainergt         ltphp require header.htmlgt          ltdiv idcontentcontainergt             ltphp include contentgt         ltdivgt          ltphp require header.htmlgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pAll of the sites content is stored in pages about.html, social.html, etc. that should be somehow loaded into the contentcontainer div of the index.php template page. This way, it should be easy to maintain and update the sites content without touching the template at all. Before this, I tried using AJAX to load in content asynchronously but I wasnt able to link directly to individual pages through that method, so using PHP GET seems like a better option. p  pI have a good idea of what I emwant to doem, but my unfamiliarity with web development and the syntax of PHP is kind of a roadblock for me right now. So, how can I use PHP GET to populate my page with content from another file strongEdit 1strong Or, am I going about this problem the wrong way, and what should I be doing insteadp  pstrongEdit 2strong For the mere sake of learning, Id kind of prefer to see how this kind of thing is done using PHP or even JS, if possible.

This is an example how the redirect works it redirects codeHunponyprofile1setingscode to codeHunponydo.phpdoprofileampdata1settingscode. The catch is that I also want to allow dots in the first match, so codeHunponyf.a.qcode would be redirected to codeHunponydo.phpdof.a.qampdatacode.p  pThe problem Im facing is that for some odd reason, the sites favicon codeHunponyfavicon.icocode is returning a 404 error, despite the fact that its linked where its supposed to be.p  pThe only possible explanation I can think of is that Apache rewrites codeHunponyfavicon.icocode to codeHunponydo.phpdofavicon.icoampdatacode, even though the file exists on the server, and since in codedo.phpcode theres no special case for a page named codefavicon.icocode, it defaults to the 404 error page. Other resources of the page are not affected by this, since theyre under subdirectories which have no dots in their name.p

Negative 48682 pI have two apps in Django where one apps model codeScopeItemcode on its instance creation must create an instance of the other apps model as well codeWorkflowcode i.e. the codeScopeItemcode contains its workflow.p  pThis works nicely when tried from the shell. Creating a new codeScopeItemcode creates a codeWorkflowcode and stores it in the codeScopeItemcode. In admin I get an error, that the codeworkflowcode attribute is required. The attribute is not filled in and the model definition requires it to be set. The overwritten codesavecode method though does this. Hence my question is, how to call codesavecode before the check in admin happensp  pIf I pick an existing codeWorkflowcode instance in admin and save successfully then, then I can see that my codesavecode method is called later and a new codeWorkflowcode is created and attached to the codeScopeItemcode instance. It is just called too late.p  pI am aware that I could allow empty codeworkflowcode attributes in a codeScopeItemcode or merge the codeScopeItemcode and the codeWorkflowcode class to avoid the issue with admin. Both would cause trouble later though and I like to avoid such hacks.p  pAlso I do not want to duplicate code in codesaveitemcode.

Negative 48682 pI created an MSI at work using Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 and Wix 3.6. I have this copy of VS from school, but if my company ever wants to edit the msi after Im gone, it will need to be on a freeware tool, so Im migrating the installer project to WixEdit.p  pI finally got the xml to compile into an MSI, and it appeared to be working. However, after testing out a few of the features, I noticed the UI sequence is broken in one particular situationp  pThe installer browses for a file on the clients machine and if the file is found, a dialog called CustomDirDataFound pops up. Otherwise if the file is not found, a CustomDirData dialog is shown. No matter what happens in these dialogs, the next dialog to pop up when next is clicked should be CustomNewInstall.p  pBoth these dialogs move to the correct CustomNewInstall dialog with the MSI I compiled in Visual Studio. However, in the WixEdit MSI, only CustomDirDataFound will go to CustomNewInstall when next is pressed. CustomDirData on the other hand will skip two dialogs and go straight to CustomVerifyReadyDlg.p  pHere is a snippet of my main UI file CustomMundo that defines the CustomDirData next button eventsp  precodeltPublish DialogCustomDirData ControlNext EventSetTargetPath ValueDATALOCATION Order1gt1ltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirData ControlNext EventDoAction ValueWixUIValidatePath Order2gtNOT WIXUIDONTVALIDATEPATHltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirData ControlNext EventSpawnDialog ValueInvalidDirDlg Order3gtlt[CDATA[NOT WIXUIDONTVALIDATEPATH AND WIXUIINSTALLDIRVALIDltgt1]]gtltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirData ControlNext PropertyCOPY ValueYesgtNOTFOUND  0ltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirData ControlNext EventNewDialog ValueCustomNewInstall Order4gtWIXUIDONTVALIDATEPATH OR WIXUIINSTALLDIRVALID1ltPublishgt codepre  pHere are the CustomDirDataFound entries for comparisonp  precodeltPublish DialogCustomDirDataFound ControlNext EventSetTargetPath ValueDATALOCATION Order1gt1ltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirDataFound ControlNext EventDoAction ValueWixUIValidatePath Order2gtNOT WIXUIDONTVALIDATEPATHltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirDataFound ControlNext EventSpawnDialog ValueInvalidDirDlg Order3gtlt[CDATA[NOT WIXUIDONTVALIDATEPATH AND WIXUIINSTALLDIRVALIDltgt1]]gtltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirDataFound ControlNext EventNewDialog ValueCustomNewInstall Order4gtWIXUIDONTVALIDATEPATH OR WIXUIINSTALLDIRVALID1ltPublishgt ltPublish DialogCustomDirDataFound ControlNext PropertyCOPY ValueYesgtFOUND  0ltPublishgt codepre  pAs you can see, CustomNewInstall should clearly be spawned when next is pressed.

If the content does reach 56px from the bottom of the codeltdivgtcode, and goes past that point, I want the footer to be partially or completely hidden, depending on how far the content goes, and to show up with the content with the scroll at the bottom of the page.

Negative 48682 pThis is specific to LightInjects interception. Is it possible to apply interception logic based on PerWebRequest lifetime so that interception logic can be conditionally turned onoff based on user input E.g. something like this.p  precode    public static void Configure              var serviceContainer  new ServiceContainer         serviceContainer.EnablePerWebRequestScope         serviceContainer.RegisterltITraceSwitcher, TraceSwitchergtnew PerScopeLifetime         serviceContainer.RegisterltIMyService, MyServicegtnew PerScopeLifetime         serviceContainer.Interceptx gt x.ServiceType  typeofIMyService, y, z gt DefineProxyTypez, IsTracingEnabled          ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider gt new LightInjectServiceLocatorserviceContainer           private static void DefineProxyTypeProxyDefinition proxyDefinition, Funcltboolgt isTracingEnabled              if isTracingEnabled             proxyDefinition.Implement gt new MyServiceInterceptor, m gt m.Name  SomeMethod           private static bool IsTracingEnabled              var traceSwitcher  ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstanceltITraceSwitchergt         return traceSwitcher.IsTracingEnabled      codepre  pNow because IMyService lifetime is defined as PerWebRequest so it is created for every web request and I was under impression that it would also call Intercept method everytime it creates MyService instance so that it can dynamically decide to apply interception logic depending on whether tracing is enabled or disabled by user. However it looks like that it calls Intercept method only once for the first time when IMyService instance is requested and for all subsequent requests it reuses the same Interception mechanism.p  pI also know I can use ITraceSwitcher logic within MyServiceInterceptor and then decide to use or bypass interception logic there but I want to avoid creation of proxies to begin with if tracing is disabled to avoid overhead of proxy calls through reflection but this is only possible if Intercept method is called for every web request. Please let me know if its doable or there is a better wayp  pThanks,p  pSyed Danish.p

Negative 48682 pIm working in C on 64bit Ubuntu 14.04.p  pI have a number of .txt files, each containing lines of floating point values 1 value per line. The lines represent parts of a complex sample, and theyre stored as reala1 n imaga1 n reala2 n imaga2, if that makes sense.p  pIn a specific scenario there are 4 text files each containing 32768 samples thus 65536 values, but I need to make the final version dynamic to accommodate up to 32 files the maximum samples per file would not exceed 32768 though. Ill only be reading the first 19800 samples depending on other things though, since the entire signal is contained in those 39600 points 19800 samples.p  pA common abstraction is to represent the files  samples as a matrix, where columns represent return signals and rows represent the value of each signal at a sampling instant, up until the maximum duration. p  pWhat Im trying to do is take the first sample from each return signal and move it into an array of doubleprecision floating point values to do some work on, move on to the second sample for each signal which will overwrite the previous array and do some work on them, and so forth, until the last row of samples have been processed.p  pIs there a way in which I can dynamically open files for each signal depending on the number of pulses Im using in that particular instance, read the first sample from each file into a buffer and ship that off to be processed. On the next iteration, the file pointers will all be aligned to the second sample, it would then move those into an array and ship it off again, until the desired amount of samples 19800 in our hypothetical case has been reached.p  pI can read samples just fine from the files using fscanfp  precoderxlength  19800 int x float buf  double rangesamples  callocnumpulses, 2  sizeofrangesamples  for i0 i lt 2  rxlength i     x  fscanfpulsefile, f, ampbuf     rangesamples  buf  codepre  pAll that needs to happen in my mind is that I need to cycle both sample and pulse in that order, so when finished with one pulse it would move on to the next set of samples for the next pulse, and so forth. What I dont know how to do is to somehow declare file pointers for all return signal files, when the number of them can vary inbetween calls e.g. do the whole thing for 4 pulses, and on the next call it can be 16 or 64.p  pIf there are any ideas  comments  suggestions I would love to hear them.p  pThanks.p

Negative 48682 pI am trying to compile a simple C program using g 4.8.2 using CMake 2.8.12.2 which makes use of C11 features and also multithreading. For that, compiler flags stdc11 and pthread must be used. From my understanding, in CMake, setting these flags can be done in various ways, one is to use the set commandp  precodesetCMAKECXXFLAGS CMAKECXXFLAGS stdc11 pthread codepre  pThe other supposedly preferred way is to use addcompileoptions commandp  precodeaddcompileoptionsstdc11 addcompileoptionspthread codepre  pOr in one line codeaddcompileoptionsstdc11 pthreadcodep  pSo, the problem is that in my case, only the first method works  by using the set command. The problem is with using the addcompileoptions which results in crash of the compiled output executable with the following message just like the pthread was not specified at allp  precodeterminate called after throwing an instance of stdsystemerror   what  Enable multithreading to use stdthread Operation not permitted Aborted core dumped codepre  pThe code I test withp  precodeinclude ltfuturegt  int main      auto a  stdasyncstdlaunchasync, []     a.wait     return 0  codepre  pFrom the fact that this program compiles, I can infer that stdc11 was applied. The question is that why pthread is not appliedp

Negative 48682 pLets say you have to return the sum of all the multiples of 2 and 3 in a set of integers from 1100. In Haskell, the code I would write would look something like thisp  precodesum [x2  xlt[1..100], x2 lt 100] union [x3  xlt[1..100], x3 lt 100] codepre  pThis uses 2 list comprehensions with a union. Another solution would be to step through each item in the list and evaluate it using a modulus, then add it to a separate list, which you would later add together.p  pBoth of these solutions come out with the same answer, but which one is more optimized if you had to do the same for, say, a list from 1..1000000p  pThe answer to the original question is 3317 if you want to create your own algorithm.p

The counts currently appear as currency too.  p  pIve used an example I found on here, Iif  Me.Value  Floor  Me.Value  , 0 , 0.00 , but all that did was make everything that showed up in that column, 0.00  I am fairly new to SSRS and have been cramming consistently for the past two weeks, but I just cannot find help on this.  Thank you in advance for anything you can offer.p  pUpdate IIFFieldsLVSWeb.Value0.00, 0, formatFieldsLVSWeb.Value, Pp  pThat worked... to a degree, but now everything is a percent.... thinking ELSE here but I dont know how ELSE goes in, Ive not once seen the word ELSE.p  pUpdate 2 The thing that Ive noticed is that in the statement, where it says, 0.00, 0, that doesnt even really apply.  Ive just put that there because Im new to this and I just needed an argument involved.  I took the 0 and changed it to N under the condition that the number was lt .99, hopeing I would just catch all of the decimals that fell below the value of 1.  Like, .23, which later became 23.45, so I COULD do that, but what I dont udnerstand is it made everything else, N, instead of a number.  Why is that  It doesnt make everything else, Pp  pIm losing my damned mind.p  pThere is also the fact that this is information being pulled from a stored procedure, I dont really know too much about those quite yet, I get assigned simple tasks ever so often as a stepping stool for learning.  I dont really know what the query was, but I couldnt edit it if I wanted to.  This can be done with expression formatting but my expression is too broad, but I get mixed results using Greater or Less than, and its probably not the wisest thing to use since these numbers are not set in stone.  My day is almost done, Ive made very very little progress, but I had a good lunch.  So success.p  pSo I provided my own answer for this problem, and it works. Thanks me.  Thanks to all the tried to help me and did help as well.  I appreciate the effort strangers will put out for each other.p  pIve had a new problem develop, I need to display a time relative to the data being pulled.  I can put NOW in there and get todays date, but if someone is pulling information from FEB, they may be a little offput by the current date.  Ill probably get this figured out soon, but if anyone can help in the meantime, I would appreciate it.p

Negative 48682 pIm developing a video gallery, I have a ScrollView with multiple views inside of it, each view has a single AVPlayer  so far its pretty standard I guess. Note that all of the AVPlayers are preloaded with their video, waiting to be played.p  pThe problem occurs when I have many items videos in the gallery. At any given time  only 16 of them are shown, from start to end, the rest shows a black screen. If Im reversing the order of the items  the other 16 from the new side are shown, and the rest shows a black screen too.p  pAdditionally, if I go to another screen and then come back to the gallery  everything becomes black and nothing shown.p  pIf im replacing the players with a random color background for each view  all of the views are shown. So I assume the problem is with the players and not with the views themselves.p  pAccording to Xcode my app only use 710 CPU and 1011 MB of RAM so it doesnt looks like a performance problem  more like a limitation of concurrent active AVPlayers but I couldnt find any information regarding that.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions this is driving me crazy.p  pThanks in advancep

I think this is the way  First merge [a1, b1, with [a2, b2, and then use the resulting merged range [merged1, merged2 and merge with [a3, b3, and so forth.  So the compiling error is no longer the issue.  Another idea is to copy all the elements from each range into a container and then sort that if that makes any sense even, but that is not the solution I seek though, but I will accept it if that is the only way.p

Negative 48682 pI have a data frameHuc12 with a count field SumCount. I wanted to create a histogram of the SumCount field for values greater than zero. Is it best to make a for loop for Huc12SumCount  0, then is it possible to do a histogram from that If possible it would be nice to not have to subset out the data where SumCOunt0 to another data frame, but if thats the only way then I can go that routep  precodefor i in 1n    if Huc12SumCount gt 0    histHuc12SumCount  codepre

Negative 48682 pstrongUPDATEstrong I have found a workaround. In the parent scope I create an object, then I bind the objects property to the input directive like thatp  precodeParent controller scope.data   Parent directive template template ltcustominput modeldata[test]gtltcustominputgt, codepre  pIn this case, everything works. However, it at least feels unnatural to create an extra object for that. I believe a more elegant solution exists.p  hr  pIn my angularjs 1.2.27 application, I have a directive which is a custom input element, it helps a user to find specific row in the database and then returns the row as a javascript object. I want to expose the selected element to the outer scope, so I use twodirectional binding. However, when a user selects something, parent scope is not notified about the changes, child directives scope is. You can see example code belowp  precodeapp.controllercustomInputController, [scope, functionscope      scope.watchmodel, functionvalue         console.logChild controller model updated          This function is called when a user has selected an object,     scope.select  functionobject          I believe the error is hiding nearby         scope.model  angular.copyobject      ]     app.directivecustomInput, function      return          restrict E,         template ...,         scope              model          ,         controller customInputController       app.controllerparentController, [scope, functionscope      scope.watchtest, functionvalue         console.logParent controller test updated      ] app.directiveparent, function      return          restrict E,         template ltcustominput modeltestgtltcustominputgt,         controller parentController       codepre  pStill, if I add a following line to the parent controllerp  precodescope.test   name test  codepre  pBoth scopes are notified about this change, so it came to my mind that initially, binding takes place, but when in child scope the strongmodelstrong gets reassigned, parent scope loses reference to the variable. p  pThis makes me sort of confused, why does reassigning the variable in child scope breaks everything, is not it the way the binding is intended to be used Obviously, the code provided is not the actual code I have trouble with, it is not possible to post it here, so there is a chance I am missing something that actually causes the error.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 48682 pMy code has changed significantly, so a little updatep  pThe exercise is to read two cpp files to count and compare a predefined list of keywordsint, bool, etc.. The goal is to learn to use the algorithm library and work with data structures beyond basic c or cpp knowledge.p  pThe teacher advises to use transform to load keywords.txt in a map. Then read file1 and with countif increment all the keyword values. Use countif with file2 to decrement the values. At the end there is a check if the files are identical, nearly identical or probably different.

Negative 48682 pThe following code is my attempt at a fairly generic javascript hash code implementation. Im planning to use this code in conjunction with a hash table implementation e.g. jshashtable that utilizes hashCode if its defined for keys. I have attempted to adhere closely to javas hash code implementations for numbers, strings, and arrays.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul liAre there any issues with this implementation regarding correctness or performance  li liAre there any preexisting implementations for hash codes that do the same or roughly the same thing li liAside from jshashtable, are there other hash table implementations that utilizes hashCode and equals in the same way that I should also considerli ul  pNOTE Im aware that the code below could leverage other libs like underscore and jquery but Id prefer not to have any 3rd party deps for my implementation.

If there were an easy and agreed upon way                     of uniquely identifying objects in javascript, a better approach                     may be to use the objects id                     result   multiplyBy31AndAddresult, stringHashCodeobj.toString                                                      return result      Generates a hash code for a 64 bit floating point number, similar to javas hash    code implementation.

Negative 48682 pRelatively new with RoR.  Using Rails 4, Foundation, using AJAX remote true.  Every time I submit an entry, the number of db entries doubles. First submission generates two, second submission generate 4, third, generates 8, and so on.  Form is a Reveal Modal.  It only adds one entry when I remove the remote true tag on the simpleformfor call, so I suspect it has something to do with that.

Negative 48682 pI have an instance in private subnet. I have two more instances in public subnet including a NAT instance. From NAT and another public instance  I am able to pingssh to the instance in private subnet successfully but the reverse case is not working. First I was trying to find out why the private instance is not connecting to the internet but then I realized it is not even connecting to public subnet. Security rules are allowing all trafficinbound and outbound for all the instances and even the routing tables are correct. What is the reason for this Is there anything that is stopping the private subnet from connecting to the public subnet, because as I understood within a VPC all instances can communicate to each other no matter what subnet they belong top

Negative 48682 pMy problem started when I began using the codeISerializationCallbackRecievercode to create a codeSerializable Dictionarycode in Unity, It worked fine for most of my classes but when I nested 2 codeSerializable Dictionariescode I started getting trouble with Enumeration.p  pI believe it was during codeOnBeforeSerializecode where the dictionary had trouble adding codeKeyValue Pairscode after a certain count, I solved this by defining a dictionary property and used it to access the data in my keys and lists, so to be a bit clearer, I was working on a codeCustom Inspectorcode which had to variations of keys, so I thought using a codeSerializable Dictionarycode would work best since I have more than a hundred variations, what my object does is it collects data from my assets and divides that data depending on the key I gave it.p  pthe code for my Scriptable Objectp  precode[System.Serializable] public class LetterDataObject  ScriptableObject      [SerializeField]     public DictionaryOfLettersData lettersData      [SerializeField]     public bool isText  false      [SerializeField]     public bool [] folds   [System.Serializable] public class LetterData      [SerializeField]     public string letterText     [SerializeField]     public Sprite letterSprite     [SerializeField]     public AudioClip letterAudio   [System.Serializable] public class LetterDataDictionary  SerializableDictltint, LetterDatagt     [System.Serializable] public class DictionaryOfLettersData  SerializableDictltint, LetterDataDictionarygt    codepre  pAs you can see every data type is codeSerializablecode, I believe my problem is the dictionary is getting modified during codeOnBeforeSerializecode probably since am accessing a codeSerializable Dictionarycode of another object, so to solve this I used a dictionary property.p  precode[Serializable] public class SerializableDictltTKey, TValuegt  DictionaryltTKey, TValuegt, ISerializationCallbackReceiver       [SerializeField, HideInInspector]     private ListltTKeygt keys  new ListltTKeygt     [SerializeField, HideInInspector]     private ListltTValuegt values  new ListltTValuegt       public DictionaryltTKey, TValuegt serializedDictionary               get         private set           public void OnBeforeSerialize               foreach var item in serializedDictionary                              if keys.Containsitem.Key                     keys.Additem.Key                  if values.Containsitem.Value                     values.Additem.Value                        public void OnAfterDeserialize              serializedDictionary  new DictionaryltTKey, TValuegt             for var i  0 i lt keys.Count i                              serializedDictionary[keys[i]]  values[i]                    codepre  pThis might not be a problem since it is solved now but am curious if someone could give a hint on what is going on  Maybe there is something I did not know about with unitys serialization so I would love it if anyone faced the same problem and could help me understand it further, I can not move on without understanding my little hack.p

Negative 48682 pI have been struggling on this issue for about one wholly day, and I think I really need some help now.p  pThings begins that the codeImageIocode package for java dont support a codewebpcode format image. So I found a hrefhttpsbitbucket.orgluciadwebpimageio relnofollowthis projecta and get things worked in my private lib package. In the meanwhile, since my project solving dependency by using maven, and seems that, that particular project was not hosted by the central maven repository yet, so I upload this jar of that codewebpimageiocode to my private maven repository. So that I can happily involve that dependency in pom.xml and make a whole packageof codeDataDrivercode in order to finally using it in my glassfish project. like thisp  precodeltgroupIdgtcom.foo.serviceltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtDataDriverltartifactIdgt ltversiongt3.7.1ltversiongt ltpackaginggtjarltpackaginggt ...   ltdependencygt       ltgroupIdgtorg.bitbucket.luciadltgroupIdgt       ltartifactIdgtwebpimageioltartifactIdgt       ltversiongt0.4ltversiongt       lttypegtjarlttypegt   ltdependencygt ... codepre  pI do a unit test for the codeDataDrivercode I wrote, and seems work fine. Frankly, I even dont know why I add a jar and the suddenly codeImageIocode package can magically work with codewebpcode now Some Run time loading But now I can deal with a codewebpcode image and I can carry on working with glassfish to deal with a codewebpcode image now.

Negative 48682 pI have a web app that runs PHP, MySQL server side on Amazon EC2, with S3 storage, and in the client  JSAngularJS. With the app, users can send a postcard to the server. A postcard is a form that includes some text and a couple of pictures that the user uploads.  After filling all the details and pushing submit, the postcard is sent    The files are uploaded to a temp folder, and their new temp names are returned to the client.    When this process is completed, another http.post request is sent to    the server with all of the postcards information, including an array    of the images temp names.   The new postcard data is written in the DB, with a STATUS and PERCENT fields.   The images are converted to a smaller format and then saved to S3. The postcard DB entry is updated STATUS  saving photos, PERCENT  40   Images table is updated with the new images IDs. postcard DB entry updated STATUS  last finishes, PERCENT  90.  a JSON response is sent to the client. postcard DB entry updated STATUS  completed, PERCENT  100.p  pThe problem is that between sending submit and receiving the JSON response  that takes a lot of time.  Photos are uploaded to the tmp folder pretty quickly, but the rest of the process takes more than 20 seconds. During that time I present a Loading screen with a progress bar, which is updated by polling the server for the postcards status and percentage fields in the postcards DB. I would like the process to be different  the user uploads the photos and then can go back to navigating the app, while the rest of the process is happening on the server, and a message successfailure will be sent when the process is done...  So how should I approach this How can I return a response from the PHP side after receiving all the necessary information from the user and continue to run the heavier operations on the server how do I send back a response to the user when the process is complete, and how can the client catch it Thanks.p  pThis is the current function on the server Im using code igniter. The function gets the JSON object sent on submit, then sends the data to my postcardmodel where all of the Data savingimage processing takes places. The response is only sent after all of these operations are completed, and that takes 2060 seconds, while the user is waiting and the user interface is not responsive. I would like that changed  getting an immediate response that the data was received, and after a minute getting another message saying that the process is complete.p  precode    public function save      data  thisgtinputgtgetpostpostcard     cleanData  jsondecodedata      try          response  thisgtpostcardmodelgtsavecleanData         thisgtjsongtresponsearray             success gt response,               catch Exception e         thisgtjsongterroregtgetMessage        codepre

Negative 48682 pIn Message Broker v8.0.0.0 we are using the event monitoring framework to drive our flowlevel auditing. Were looking at three types of audit  start, and and rollback and the corresponding transaction.StartEndRollback events as defined by Message Broker are being used for this.p  pFor rollback, within each flow, we have a generic exception handler thats catching the exception terminal from the input node, does some processing, and then throws an exception again. This means we get a rollback event from broker and the original message is backed out to DLQ.p  pHowever, for these cases, we are getting four events instead of the two expected i.e. Start and Rollback. There is an extra Start event and an End event being generated.p  pI looked around and theres a possible duplicate of this issue in the MQSeries forums, where somebody suggested that this is because the message is being backed out.

Negative 48682 pI get this error when trying to access localhost via a browser.p  blockquote   p403 Forbiddenp blockquote  pI use Ubuntu 14.04 LTSp  pHere is my configuration filep  petcapache2.confp  pre       This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the      configuration directives that give the server its instructions.      See httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4 for detailed information about      the directives and usrsharedocapache2README.Debian about Debian specific      hints.                Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian      The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to      upstreams suggested way to configure the web server. This is because DebiansA      default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,      virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in      order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as      possible.       It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined      below, all located in the etcapache2 directory             etcapache2         apache2.conf             ports.conf         modsenabled            .load            .conf         confenabled            .conf         sitesenabled             .conf                 apache2.conf is the main configuration file this file. It puts the pieces        together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the        web server.            ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is        supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be        customized anytime.            Configuration files in the modsenabled, confenabled and sitesenabled        directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,        global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,        respectively.             They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their        respective available counterparts. These should be managed by using our        helpers a2enmoda2dismod, a2ensitea2dissite and a2enconfa2disconf. See        their respective man pages for detailed information.            The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in        the default configuration, apache2 needs to be startedstopped with        etcinit.dapache2 or apache2ctl. Calling usrbinapache2 directly will not        work with the default configuration.        Global configuration                 ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers      configuration, error, and log files are kept.           NOTE  If you intend to place this on an NFS or otherwise network      mounted filesystem then please read the Mutex documentation available      at       you will save yourself a lot of trouble.

KeepAlive On            MaxKeepAliveRequests The maximum number of requests to allow      during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.      We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.          MaxKeepAliveRequests 100            KeepAliveTimeout Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the      same client on the same connection.

The former is used by web applications packaged in Debian,      the latter may be used for local directories served by the web server.

Negative 48682 pI am trying to create a uvn quaternion based camera in opengl, having used a variety of tutorials listed below, and having read up on quaternions and axis angle rotation. I am left with a peculiar bug which I cannot seem to fix.p  pBasically the camera seems to work fine up until the camera is rotated approx 45 degrees from z at this point tilting the camera up or down seems to tilt the camera around its target axis, turning the up vector.p  pBy the time the camera faces along z tilting up or down gives the illusion of the opposite, up tilts down and down tilts up.p  pI have seen other implementations suggesting the use of a non uvn system where quaternions are accumulated into one which describes the current orientation as a delta from some arbitrary start angle. This sounds great however I cant seem to work out exactly how I would implement this, specifically the conversion from  this to a view matrix.p  pElsewhere on SO I read about splitting the rotation into two quaternions that represent the yaw and pitch separately but Im not convinced that this is the cause of the problem since in this context, correct me if I am wrong but my understanding is that the order in which you apply the two rotations does not matter.p  pRelevant Source Code Snippetsp  pQuarternion Operationsp  precodeQuaternionltTValuegt conjugate const             return Quaternion  mvalues[X], mvalues[Y], mvalues[Z], mvalues[W]     QuaternionltTValuegtamp operatorconst QuaternionltTValuegtamp rhs          TValue x, y, z, w             w  rhs[W]  mvalues[W]  rhs[X]  mvalues[X]  rhs[Y]  mvalues[Y]  rhs[Z]  mvalues[Z]             x  rhs[W]  mvalues[X]  rhs[X]  mvalues[W]  rhs[Y]  mvalues[Z]  rhs[Z]  mvalues[Y]             y  rhs[W]  mvalues[Y]  rhs[X]  mvalues[Z]  rhs[Y]  mvalues[W]  rhs[Z]  mvalues[X]             z  rhs[W]  mvalues[Z]  rhs[X]  mvalues[Y]  rhs[Y]  mvalues[X]  rhs[Z]  mvalues[W]                        mvalues[X]  x             mvalues[Y]  y             mvalues[Z]  z             mvalues[W]  w             return this  static QuaternionltTValuegt rotationVectorlt3, TValuegt axis, TValue angle         float x, y, z, w         TValue halfTheta  angle  2.0f         TValue sinHalfTheta  sinhalfTheta         return QuaternionltTValuegt  axis[X]  sinHalfTheta, axis[Y]  sinHalfTheta, axis[Z]  sinHalfTheta, coshalfTheta    codepre  pVector Rotation Operationp  precodeVectorltdimensions, TValuegt rotateconst Vectorlt3, TValuegt axis, float angle         QuaternionltTValuegt R  QuaternionltTValuegtrotationaxis, angle         QuaternionltTValuegt V  this         Vectorltdimensions, TValuegt result  R  V  R.conjugate         return result  codepre  pCamera Methodsp  precodeCameraCameraVectorlt2, intgt windowSize, float fov, float near, float far muvnMatrixlt4, floatgtidentity, mtranslationMatrixlt4, floatgtidentity, marwindowSize[DimensionsX]  floatwindowSize[DimensionsY], mfovfov, mnearnear, mfarfar, mposition, mforward  0, 0, 1  , mup  0, 1, 0        setViewMatrixMatrixlt4, floatgtidentity     setProjectionMatrixMatrixlt4, floatgtperspectivemar, mnear, mfar, mfov   Matrixlt4, floatgt CameragetVPMatrix const     return mvp   const Vectorlt3, floatgt CameraglobalY  Vectorlt3, floatgt  0, 1, 0    void CamerasetProjectionMatrixconst Matrixlt4, floatgt p     mprojection  p     mvp  mprojection  mview   void CamerasetViewMatrixconst Matrixlt4, floatgt v     mview  v     mvp  mprojection  mview   void CamerasetTranslationMatrixconst Matrixlt4, floatgt t     mtranslation  t     setViewMatrixmuvn  mtranslation   void CamerasetPositionVectorlt3, floatgt position     if position  mposition         mposition  position         setTranslationMatrixMatrixlt4, floatgttranslationposition        void CameramoveForwardfloat ammount     setPositionmposition  mforward  ammount   void CameramoveRightfloat ammount     setPositionmposition  getRight  ammount   void CameramoveUpfloat ammount     setPositionmposition  mup  ammount   void CamerasetLookAtVectorlt3, floatgt target, Vectorlt3, floatgt up     Vectorlt3, floatgt newUp  up.normalize     Vectorlt3, floatgt newForward  target.normalize     if newUp  mup  newForward  mforward         mup  newUp         mforward  newForward          Vectorlt3, floatgt newLeft  getLeft         mup  newLeft  mforward          muvn  generateUVN         setViewMatrixmuvn  mtranslation        void CamerarotateXfloat angle     Vectorlt3, floatgt hAxis  globalY  mforward.normalize     mforward  mforward.rotatehAxis, angle.normalize     mup  mforward  hAxis.normalize      muvn  generateUVN     setViewMatrixmtranslation  muvn   void CamerarotateYfloat angle     Vectorlt3, floatgt hAxis  globalY  mforward.normalize     mforward  mforward.rotateglobalY, angle.normalize     mup  mforward  hAxis.normalize      muvn  generateUVN     setViewMatrixmtranslation  muvn   Vectorlt3, floatgt CameragetRight     return mforward  mup.normalize   Vector lt3, floatgt CameragetLeft     return mup  mforward.normalize  codepre  pp  pI am guessing that the problem is in either my implementation of a quaternion or the way I am using it, but due to the complex nature of the system I cannot seem to pin down the problem any further than that.

Negative 48682 pI did some research but a little confused as to how to solve this problem. I have a tableview whose cells have a button in it. When the user clicks the button the background of the cell changes. Now I was to save that background color so when the user starts the app up they are the color they selected. I believe the best way to do this is with nsuserdefaults but not 100 sure. If thats  the case do I set up a dictionary for this If someone can steer me in the right direction I would appreciate it.p

Negative 48682 pNew to iOS development and trying to develop my app with correct practices. My main issue is trying to figure out the best way to store a bunch of simple data globally.p  pThe app connects to a computer adhoc wifi and gathers information about the current state. ex gpu temp, computer name, display resolution, datetime, etc. The various view controllers I have then allow the user to adjust some of these settings so I want to be able to keep track of these changes across all view controllers. p  pI have been wrestling between using a plist, core data, or singleton class to store all the information. Since the user will be connected to one computer for the life of the app I am leaning towards singleton since it seems easiest to get and set data. However, I have read that using a singleton is really not the best practice for various reasons. I have read up on plists and core data a little and seems like a decent amount of work just to get and set values. Should I spend the time using those or would some other method be a better way to accomplish all of this. p  pstrongUpdatestrong After both answers from Aaoli and Swift Rabbit. I wanted to clarify for my use case that the data I am storing did not need to be saved when the app was closed. So if you are coming to this question and need to store your data even if the app closes look at SwiftRabbits answer.p

Negative 48682 pI have a problem with filtering with a search bar. Currently the filter that is in place functions but it has unwanted functionality. Because it is filtering through a JSON it will display table fields that are not based on the actual shown information because its linked to it in parts of the JSON that are unused. p  pAs such I want a filter which only queries against what is shown in the table. I have been trying to utilise searchKeyword like sop  pcodeltinput ngmodelsearchKeyword.c.referencegtcodep  pThis works but this is only one of the table columns. What I want to do is have multiple. However the following is not valid.p  pcodeltinput ngmodelsearchKeyword.c.reference ampamp c.otherStuffgtcodep  pIs there a way to have multiple in the statement from what I can find the answer seems to be no or will I need a custom filter and if so what would be the best approachp  pThanks.p

Im using such large instances in order to maximize flexibility of resource allocation.

Looking through Spark UI, Im not seeing task with input size of more than a few GB. Im steering on the side of caution when giving the driver process so much memory in order to ensure that it isnt memory starved for any intermediate resultaggregation operations.p  pIm trying to keep the number of cores per executor down to 5 as per suggestions in a hrefhttpblog.cloudera.comblog201503howtotuneyourapachesparkjobspart2 relnofollowClouderas How To Tune Your Spark Jobs seriesa according to them, more that 5 cores tends to introduce a HDFS IO bottleneck. Im also making sure that there is enough of spare RAM and CPUs left over for the host OS and Hadoop services.p  h3My findings thus farh3  pMy only clue is Spark UI showing very long Scheduling Delay for a number of tasks at the tailend of execution. I also get the feeling that the stagestasks timeline shown by Spark UI does not account for all of the time that the job takes to finish. I suspect that the driver application is stuck performing some kind of a lengthy operation either at the end of every training iteration, or at the end of the entire training run.p  pIve already done a fair bit of research on tuning Spark applications. Most articles will give great suggestions on using RDD operations which reduce intermediate input size or avoid shuffling of data between stages. In my case Im basically using an outofthebox algorithm, which is written by ML experts and emshouldem already be well tuned in this regard. My own code that outputs GBT model to S3 should take a trivial amount of time to run.p
