Positive 16157 pQuick, probably simple, question. I have a view whose background is animating, and during that time, I want to disable the user from interacting with the view. My view is a FrameLayout, and Im capturing touch events with onTouchEvent. Solutions Ive triedp  p1 First setOnTouchListenernull, then setOnTouchListenerthis. Problem is, my view only calls onTouchEventMotionEvent, and not onTouchView, MotionEvent, so I cant pump through the Events there.p  p2 First setEnabledfalse, then setEnabledtrue. The source code says  A disabled view that is clickable still consumes the touch events, it just doesnt respond to them. Problem is, MotionEvents still get pumped through in onTouchEvent.p  p3 requestDisallowInterceptTouchEventfalse, then true. This only handles touch events from the parent.p  pThe solution I have working is using a boolean variable isAnimating, and checking the value of that in onTouchEvent. Id rather not do this, because it looks ugly to me and Id rather use the API for it than reinvent the wheel, sooo... anyone got any ideas Thanks. p

I believe this applies to all view formats, but I am using Cards view.p  pWhen you scroll down the articles a bit, there is a top bar called codefloatingBarcode that gives you controls on the top for the entire category, such as marking all articles as read.p  pIf you enable touch in chrome and then finger spread to zoom in, that bar will zoom along with the rest of the content, moving the control buttons out of view to the right. I need to defeat this behavior with CSS.p  pIf instead you use codeCtlcodecodecode to zoom in, the bar reformats correctly to keep the control icons visible. So this is a problem specific to chrome touch support.p  pthe width is specified in pixels so I though if I change the codewidthcode for codefloatingBarcode to, for example, code85vwcode, it might work. But it does not if I change the zoom again.p  ol liis there any CSS solution to this problemli liif not, can someone help me poll the visible viewport and find the difference between that and the window width, using jquery to reset the width of codefloatingBarcode as neededli ol

Positive 16157 pWhat I want to do is when I press a certain keyboard button or combination, a touch event should be fired with given screen coordinates.p  pI would like to use a physical keyboard connected to an Android device. I want to write code which runs in the background continuously and listens for a specific combination and then when it is pressed a touch event is created with specific coordinates. The touch event should be received by whatever app which is in foreground.p  pTo be more specific, I find it annoying that the Facebook Messenger app does not send messages when I press enter but inserts a newline in the textbox. Or at least it would be nice to have an option to enable or disable this feature, like the Windows Phone version of the app. But it does not have this option, and it drives me crazy when I type my messages on the physical keyboard and have to touch the little button on the phone itself, moving my hand from the keyboard, or I have to use tabbing navigation to select the button control and then press enter.p  pThis app would primarily be for personal use, and I am asking this question to make sure that it is even possible to write such code and to improve my knowledge.p

When sending 1000 packetssecond 1 ms wait time, it only takes 13 microseconds to call send.  At 1 packetsecond 1000 ms wait time, that time increases to 20 microseconds. p  precodeWait time ms                      us to send 0                                   8.67    1                                   12.97   10                                  13.06   100                                 18.03   1000                                20.82 10000                               57.20 codepre  pWe see this phenomenon from both Java and C and on both Windows and Solaris.

Negative 16157 pI am near the end stages of developing an iPhone application and will be releasing it as both a lite adsupported version and a pro adfree, likely with additional functionality at some point version.p  pIve followed suggestions here and elsewhere about creating multiple targets, etc. and am able to build these without any problems.p  pBut this does bring to mind a question What is the best, most userfriendly, accepted way in which to handle transitioning from a lite version of an app to a pro versionp  pAs I see it  and please correct me if any of my assumptions are wrong  there are potentially two ways to do thisp  ol lipGive each application its own Bundle identifier ie. com.companyname.fooapplite and com.companyname.fooapppro. This will result in both being treated as being completely separate entities. Data is not automatically migrated should a user move from one to the other and both could very well have both installed on the same iPhone at the same time.pli lipGive each application the same Bundle identifier ie. com.companyname.fooapp, so that they are treated as essentially the same application. The lite version of the application will be overwritten by the pro version if they download and install it. Data from the lite version is maintained in the pro version.pli ol  pThe latter seems ideal to me  I cant imagine someone wanting to keep a lite version after theyve just purchased a pro version  but this brings up a few questionsp  ul lipDoes Apple even allow option 2pli lipWill using option 2 result in any goofiness I should be aware of, ie. the two versions stepping on eachother in some way.pli lipIf its not allowed, is there a suggested practice in place to migrate data from what are basically two completely different applications Im aware of StoreKit, but it isnt supported on free applications.pli ul  pAs it is, this current app doesnt really generate data of huge value and the worst thing that will happen is users will have to reenter some authentication credentials upon upgrading to pro. But down the road, if I were to develop a similar app that stores valuable data locally, Id like to know how to best transition users and their data in a seamless manner.p  pThanks,p  ul liJeffli ul

Negative 16157 pA thirdparty supplier is providing me with some XML, that one of my applications is happily processing. For debugging reasons, I want to look at it, but it doesnt display anything in the browser, and I and other members of my team have to viewsource to look at the ugly XML.p  pThis sounds like a classic usecase for XSLT, I thought.

Pop those rules, maybe some Javascript, and a pointer to the XMLs URL into a stronglocalstrong HTML file, and every time I open the file, voila  freshly fetched and formatted HTML.p  pHowever, I am being bitten by the Common Origin Policy XMLHttpRequest. It declines to fetch the XML because it comes from a different server  apparently for security reasons to avoid sending inappropriate cookies.

Negative 16157 pIm trying to do a little bit of HTML parsing in Python which Im horrible at to be quite honest. Ive been up googling ways to do this but cant get anything to work. Here is my situation. I have a web page that has a BUNCH of links to downloads. What I want to do is specify a search string, and if the string I am searching for is there, download the file. But it needs to get the entire file name. For example if I am searching for game1 and the name of the actual game is game1somethingelse, I want it to download game11somethingelse. I have already used the following code to obtain the source of the page precode import urllib2 file  urllib2.urlopenhttpwww.example.commyexampledir dload  file.read precode This grabs the entire source code of the webpage which is just a directory by itself. For example, I have tons of tags. I have codelta hrefcode tags, codelttdgtcode tags, etc. I want to string the tags so all I have is a list of the files in the directory of the web page, then I want to use a regular expression or something simliar to search for what I am searching for, take the entire file name, and download it.p

Negative 16157 pAxum is a language of its own based on subset and superset of C 3.0 and TPL is extentions added to .Net 4.0.

Negative 16157 pIm currently developing an app for iOSdevices. This app downloads data from a wordpress blog, but fetches a noncetoken first. This has been tested, and is showing to take about 23 seconds, which is a lot, considering its a mobile device that should have the data ready in a few seconds. In addition to this, the data has to be downloaded as well, which takes another 45 seconds.p  pIn the datafetchingmethod there are several securitymeasures taken, for example a secret string that needs to match on both the webserver and device of course encrypted, and some sort of simple UDIDvalidation  some header and useragenttests. Is this enough, or do I really need the nonces Its not like there is any sensitive data being passed through, and if it was, Id of course encrypt it further.p  pIs it really necessary for me to use noncesbr Thank you.p

Negative 16157 pTo get a better idea of how matrix transformations work cause Im having a fairly hard time seeing what actually happens, I decided to write some scripts that will take a 3D model and then do some translations, rotations, and scaling, since looking at what actually happens when I play around with different values may be helpful.p  pIve already written the scripts to parse a 3D model, so now I just need to write the transformation functions.p  pI am using the Euclid module, which was amongst several suggestions for working with matrices though this question is not really pythonspecific so I left out that tagp  pSo far Ive been able to successfully translate a model based on the x,y,z values that I provide.p  pNow Im working on the scaling function, and have also managed to scale the model by whatever factor, but Im having a hard time getting it to scale on the spot since the model isnt centered at the origin.p  pHow can I build a transform matrix that will take into account the center of some arbitrary modelp

Negative 16157 pIm very pleased with the various HTML templates available for phpDocs. I was wondering about additional PDF templates for my PHP application which Im writing as a capstone project and would like to include as a supplement to my paper. The default PDF template seems to ignore a few tags, and has a lot of issues with inappropriate whitespace. p  pIf there are no usersubmitted PDF templates elsewhere, where might I look to learn how to edit the default to, for example, adjust the whitespace issues and change the fontfontsize, etc. Or, is there a better alterative to phpDoc that specializes in the PDF format Some of the HTML ones are very nicelooking, but have no options to print as an entire document.p  pThanksp

Negative 16157 pFor a project, I was working with a partner writing a decision tree implementation.  Since both of us are relative newcomers to C and had to work quickly, we basically dumped all the functionality in a single file, which ended up being over 1600 lines.  It was a quick and dirty project to get working, but now the next assignment has us responsible for extending and reimplementing the code.  In its current condition, that isnt going to happen.p  pRight now, Im breaking up the original source based on function responsibility.  Thing is, many of the functions are intertwined, and Im getting major errors with my make file.  More specifically, the other source files are reporting implicit declaration of functions that are declared in a separate file.p  pI really have no experience with multiple file makefiles.

Negative 16157 pIm working on a program using a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagereactivebananareactivebananaa, and Im wondering how to structure my types with the basic FRP building blocks.p  pFor instance, heres a simplified example from my real program say my system is composed primarily of emwidgetsem  in my program, pieces of text that vary over time.p  pI could havep  precodenewtype Widget  Widget  widgetText  Behavior String  codepre  pbut I could also havep  precodenewtype Widget  Widget  widgetText  String  codepre  pand use codeBehavior Widgetcode when I want to talk about timevarying behaviour. This seems to make things simpler, and means I can use codeBehaviorcode operations more directly, rather than having to unpack and repack Widgets to do it.p  pOn the other hand, the former seems to avoid duplication in the code that actually defines widgets, since almost all of the widgets vary over time, and I find myself defining even the few that dont with codeBehaviorcode, since it lets me combine them with the others in a more consistent manner.p  pAs another example, with both representations, it makes sense to have a codeMonoidcode instance and I want to have one in my program, but the implementation for the latter seems more natural since its just a trivial lifting of the list monoid to the newtype.p  pMy actual program uses codeDiscretecode rather than codeBehaviorcode, but I dont think thats relevant.p  pSimilarly, should I use codeBehavior Coord,Coordcode or codeBehavior Coord, Behavior Coordcode to represent a 2D point In this case, the former seems like the obvious choice but when its a fiveelement record representing something like an entity in a game, the choice seems less clear.p  pIn essence, all these problems reduce down top  pstrongWhen using FRP, at what layer should I apply the codeBehaviorcode typestrongp  pThe same question applies to codeEventcode too, although to a lesser degree.p

So far so good, but when I try to check for the saved propertys value with codeif [theObject valueForKeytheBooleanValue]  [NSNumber numberBOOLNO]do somethingcode it never jumps into the if clause. But if I check for code [NSNumber numberWithInt0]code its working... so basically I try to save a bool but its recognized as an int... Any ideas whats going on therep

Negative 16157 pI have an iPad App which includes a Google Map. On that Map I can draw lines and place markers with Google Map API V3. All done with jQuery Mobile and PhoneGap. p  pThe Problem I have is that I need a higher Zoom on the Map, than Google provides me.  I did that with setting CSS scale to the Google Map div. The Zoom is working.p  pThe problem isp  pIf I place Markers on the zoomed Map they are not on the Place, where I click. They appear somewhere else on the map, because of the Div Zoom is changing coordinates.  If I scale the App on iPad, it is working. However I only want to scale the map and not the whole app.p  pThanks for any help or ideas.p

Negative 16157 pI have error handling code that is designed to catch unnhandled exceptions, and then create a dump.p  pNow, ive encountered a few situations where this doesnt work well in the transition between Native and managed code.  p  pFor example if in a codePaintcode event I call some native code, and that native code throws an exception.br The message loop dispatcher will catch the native exception, and then rethrow a .NET codeSEHExceptioncode.br Same thing happens sometimes with DLLS that host COM objects.p  pThe problem with this is that because of the stackroll back and the way it catches and creates an codeSEHExceptioncode from the native exception, the actual Native call stack is destroyed.  p  pCan i get the native call stack somehow, using the codeSEHExceptioncode  note that the call stack in the SEHException is the CLR call stack.p  pOr can i set the application so it will save the call stack somehow p

Things to note, there is no log in so I can direct python right to the link where dropbox pops up but it wont download the file.p  precodeimport urllib  url  httpsthewebsitedownload.com   filename  filetobedownloaded.exe   urllib.urlretrieveurl, filename codepre  pThats the code I use to use and it worked like a charm for direct downloads but now when I try to use it for the site that has the dropbox popup download it just ends up downloading the html code of the site from what I can tell and does not actually download the file. I am still relatively new to python coding in general but I am loving it so far this is just the first brick wall that I have hit that I didnt find any similar resolutions to. Thanks in advance Sample codes help so much thats how I have been learning so far.p

Negative 16157 pstrongGeneral Querystrong  Is there a way to read a variable from another PHP file, without running the file as the variable had been set at another point in time, using a third PHP file, and without the use of a databasep  pstrongSpecific Instancestrong I created a webpage that my boss wants to change daily.  He doesnt want to access the raw HTML and CSS coding, as any mistake will lead to headaches on my end.  So I thought I might create a small portal that will allow him to change the specific string data within the webpage each day, limiting his access to the code.p  pThe framework I conceived would work like thisp  ul liindex.php is the page that is viewable by everyone on the internet.  When it is rendered, Id like it to request the Category variable that was saved previously in another file.li liedit.php is a webpage that displays a simple form with two input boxes  Category and Password.  When the submit button is clicked, it POSTs the data to the file below.li liconfiguration.php is the file that edit.php hands the form information off to.  Once the form information has been handed off, it checks to see if the crypt version of the input password matches, and then stores the Category information in a variable called Category.li ul  pNow, I need a way for index.php to read the previously saved value of Category within the configuration.php file, without running it, and without using a database as I do not have access to one.  I dont think I can use session values, because this value should be the same for all users and all sessions, until it is changed again by my boss.  Is there any way to implement this, or should I be using a different methodp

Negative 16157 pI am trying to update several columns in a MySQL table by using an input form. The code Ive written basically looks up all the values in the MySQL table and prints them back as values in a POST form in HTML. The user can then change the values to whatever, and the POST data is processed in PHP and the tables are updated. Everything seems to work except for one column where its taking the values Im entering in and its replacing them with something else. For example, when I enter in 600, it inputs it as 6.00.

Negative 16157 pI am trying to write some code to help me error handle compiled versions of my software.

Negative 16157 pIm working on a class library project which provides client applications with a lot of useful extension methods. This project is expected to be used on a large variety of platforms versions of the .NET framework.p  pIn order to do that Im going to use several separate Visual Studio projects, each one for its own platform. These projects could have their own outer dependencies though the source code will be shared between them with the use of the add as a reference feature. That approach will allow me to change the implementation for all projects by writing code in just one file without any need to copy it to other projects. Keeping in mind differences in target frameworks, I will need to use codeifcode compiler directives. The result of each project will be published as a NuGet package for a specific version of the .NET framework.p  pstrongHere are two questions I havestrongp  ol liEvery new file has to be added to every project otherwise it wont be compiled and every class defined in it wont be accessible on certain platform. As you can realize its very easy to forget that. Is there any way to avoid this kind of file tracking Is it possible to automate itli liHow can I improve the whole infrastructure What approaches andor solutions do you use in your projectsli ol

Negative 16157 pI am building a simple app built in PhoneGap that uses a REST API to load in data from my website on the server because you cant run PHP inside PhoneGap.p  pAn example for listing some data might bep  precode.ajax     url httpmyserver.compostsindex.json,     dataType jsonp,     success functiondata          for var i0,totaldata.length ilttotal i                       console.logdata.Post.title[i]                codepre  pThis is fine and the returned data can be used in my PhoneGap app. However lets say that the post list requires you to be logged in...p  pHow would I handle this Because unlike a normal authentication request whereby it redirects to the login form, in my JSON world this would not happen. In fact what happens is the strongactual HTML login form gets returned which then causes an error because my JavaScript is expecting JSON and not HTML.strongp  pIs there a best practice for handling this, such as if authentication requested then load the login form view in the PhoneGap app instead of returning the HTML login form from the app as its currently doing Perhaps sending a auth request via JSONp  pAs an example a simple JSONized method looks likep  precodepublic function index      thisgtsetposts, thisgtpaginate     thisgtsetserialize, arrayposts  codepre  pAnd as stated earlier I can protect this method in the codebeforeFiltercode by strongnotstrong passing the method name into the codethisgtAuthgtallowcode. So Im presuming I would need to do something clever in the beforeFilter to know if the request is JSON and if so then check if the method requires authorisation and then if so either send back an error instead of the HTML form as Cake usually does via the AuthComponent in JSON or allow access.p  pstrongUPDATE 13th Jan 2012strongp  pAfter doing some research on this subject more, Ive looked at the Forrst API as they seem to have built effectively what I am looking to build in terms of a RESTful API.p  pFor example they have a call like a hrefhttpsforrst.comapiv2postcommentstinyidHUDhttpsforrst.comapiv2postcommentstinyidHUDa this is basically saying display the comments for post with tiny id of HUD. What you will get returned is the following if you are not authenticatedp  precoderesperrorthis method requires authentication,statfail,in0.0903,authedfalse,authedasfalse,envprod codepre  pNow the interesting part is EVEN if I am logged into Forrst I will still get that error message because its not looking at my session rather its expecting a token of some kind to authenticate the actual request. e.g. codeaccesstoken550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000codep  pstrongSo the main question here I guess, is how do I build this into my Cake App The plan is as followsstrongp  pIn my app it would have redirected you to the login page regardless if you have requested it via AJAX or in the browser. strongForrst handles both and ALWAYS returns JSON errors when calling its API and doesnt return HTML everstrong This is what I want to achieve in my implementation. I have added an accesstoken column to my users table which changes whenever anyone updates their password for security reasons. The next step is to A check for this access token for protected methods and either allow or deny if its correct and then B I need someway of handling when no token exists or is incorrect and sending the correct error status instead of the HTML login form.p

And that random list should be used within the loop with index i to get the pseudorandom value. So within the loop the same random number will be at index i based on the seed. Yet there shouldnt be a single random number same throughout the loop. But the sequence should be the same for each program run. Independent of number of threads or which thread is evaluating a part of the cycle.p  pIt wouldnt be very efficient to create that list nonmultithreaded and use that initialized list within the multithreaded loop.

The background can be different for each instance of the class so it cannot be a static file.

Negative 16157 pI am using a regular Visual Studio Setup Project to deploy my ASP.NET application. I need to handle the case of an existing web.config existing in the target directory. When one is found, it needs to be renamed before the install takes place. If this does not happen, the new web.config will not overwrite the old. How can I get my custom action to rename the old web.config BEFORE the files being installed are copied So far I have tried by deriving from System.Configuration.Install.Installer and overriding the OnBeforeInstall, Install and Commit. It seems that all of these methods take place after the new files are copied into the target directory.p

Negative 16157 pIm in the process of converting a Java EE 6 application to Spring  nonEE Container for example Jetty and Im looking for an alternative to Java EEs Singleton Session Bean usually implemented by using the codeSingletoncode annotation.p  pThe emSingletonem aspect of it is easily handled by Spring. But the codeSingletoncode annotation also implies concurrency guarantees By default, all methods of a Singleton Session Bean are strictly serialized by a writelock. The behavior is can be changed by using the codeLockcodeannotation.p  pIs there any  ideally dropin equivalent in Spring The codeLockcode customization feature is not necessary, Im just looking for a better alternative than manually synchronizing every method of every Singleton Session Bean.p
Negative 16157 pI have few questions to ask for you after some researches and practices in certain area. Firstly, I am wondering is there any implementation to make sure that the SMS send is received before the outgoing call at the receiving android phone. Because i want to display the location of caller as toast in android which needs to be before the call received. Secondly, is it possible to make toast to stay as long as the call finishes. Finally, Can i have BroadcastReceiver of call state and SMS receive in same class. Your help is extremely appreciated.p

Negative 16157 pBased on recent feedback and findings on this problem, Ive rewritten the question to get rid of noise.p  pI have 2 separate code paths, one in Java Android, one and Python which accomplish the following for the purposes of negotiating a pairing between an Android device and a PythonDjango.p  pJavap  ul liGenerate a syncKeyli liHash a concatenated string of various values using the presharedKey including the syncKeyli liEncrypt the syncKey using a presharedKeyli liSend the Hash, encrypted syncKey, DeviceId and arbitrary variables to web serverli ul  pPythonp  ul liGet the presharedKey from the deviceIdli liDecrypt the encrypted syncKeyli liHash a concatenated string of various values using the presharedKey including the decrypted syncKeyli liMake sure the hash matches, which confirms that the syncKey was decrypted successfully, and that the deviceId holds the correct presharedKey.li ul  pNow this process works if I send the syncKey unencrypted. The final hash matches, which proves the deviceId has the correct presharedkey, however as soon as I add the endecryption into the process, the hash no longer matches, despite the fact that both the syncKey and concatenated string appear to match perfectly character for character from the debug output of both JavaPython.p  pOne quirk of the process is that a 256bit key is necessary for the AES256 encryption algorithm, so Im chopping the 512bit presharedKey in half. The alternative of using only a 256bit key across the board was requiring that I pass the key through codeencodeasciicode on the python side, or else it was throwing up errors during hashing with the shorter key.p  pHere is the relevant codep  pJavap  precodeString presharedKey  getKey  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd0c1c8e36fddba501ef92e72c95b47e07f98f7fd9cb63da75c008a3201124ea5d  String deviceId  getDeviceId  1605788742789230  SyncKey syncKey  generateSyncKey  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  String concat  syncKey.hexString  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  String ALGORITHM  HmacSHA256 String hash  null try      SecretKeySpec keySpec  new SecretKeySpec         presharedKey.getBytes,         ALGORITHM     Mac mac  Mac.getInstanceALGORITHM     mac.initkeySpec     byte[] result  mac.doFinalconcat.getBytes     hash  Base64.encodeToStringresult, Base64.DEFAULT      FpDE2JLmCBrrWnjBHH13F8AV80sUM2fQAY2IpRs  catch NoSuchAlgorithmException x   catch InvalidKeyException x    String encKey  presharedKey.substring0, presharedKey.length  2  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd  int len  encKey.length byte[] encKeyBytes  new byte[len  2] for int i  0 i lt len i  2      encKeyBytes[i  2]  byte Character.digitencKey.charAti, 16 ltlt 4              Character.digitencKey.charAti1, 16   String encryptedSyncKey  null try      byte[] iv   0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00      AlgorithmParameterSpec ivSpec  new IvParameterSpeciv     SecretKeySpec encKeySpec  new SecretKeySpecencKeyBytes, AES     Cipher cipher  Cipher.getInstanceAESCBCPKCS5Padding     cipher.initCipher.ENCRYPTMODE, encKeySpec, ivSpec     byte[] encryptedSyncKeyBytes  cipher.doFinalsyncKey.hexString.getBytes     encryptedSyncKey  Base64.encodeToStringencryptedSyncKeyBytes, Base64.DEFAULT              Yrl0SuTUUTC6oJ8o4TCOy65EwO0JzoXfEi9kLq0AOlf6rHnN7BEc0s5uE7TIo1UlJbDvR2Ca         ACmQVXXhgpZUTB4sQ0eSot32lg0EEb9xKI5CZ4l9QO5raw0xBn7rtfIdVm8AIFkN9QCcthS0DF         KH3oWhpwNStfEuibLPgGqPzGTozmido9U9lb4n       catch InvalidAlgorithmParameterException e   catch NoSuchAlgorithmException e   catch NoSuchPaddingException e   catch InvalidKeyException e   catch IllegalBlockSizeException e   catch BadPaddingException e    sendStuffToWebencryptedSyncKey, deviceId, hash codepre  pPythonp  precodehash  getHashrequest  hash from Java FpDE2JLmCBrrWnjBHH13F8AV80sUM2fQAY2IpRs  encryptedsynckey  getEncSyncKeyrequest  encryptedSyncKey from Java  Yrl0SuTUUTC6oJ8o4TCOy65EwO0JzoXfEi9kLq0AOlf6rHnN7BEc0s5uE7TIo1UlJbDvR2Ca  ACmQVXXhgpZUTB4sQ0eSot32lg0EEb9xKI5CZ4l9QO5raw0xBn7rtfIdVm8AIFkN9QCcthS0DF  KH3oWhpwNStfEuibLPgGqPzGTozmido9U9lb4n  deviceid  getDeviceIdrequest  1605788742789230  presharedkey  getPresharedKeyFromDevicedeviceId  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd0c1c8e36fddba501ef92e72c95b47e07f98f7fd9cb63da75c008a3201124ea5d  enckey  presharedkey[lenpresharedkey2]  f8250b0d5960444e4de6ecc3a78900bb941246a1dece7848fc72b90092ab3ecd  aes  AES.newenckey.decodehex, AES.MODECBC, IVx0016 synckey  aes.decryptbase64.b64decodeencryptedsynckey  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  concat  synckey  824C1EE9EF507B52EA28362C71BD4AD512A5F82ACFAE80DEF531F73AC124CA814BA30CE805A157D6ADB9EC04FC99AAE6FDC4238FCD76B87CE22BC2FE33B2E5C9  import hashlib from hmac import new as hmac  verifyhash  hmacpresharedkey, concat, hashlib.sha256.digest.encodebase64  IoSc2w2sQ4fwhJTdUQHwHdyjyranzQ1z3J5LfYbA codepre  pFrom the debug output below you can see the codesyncKeycode is encrypted and decrypted successfully, and the codeconcatcode is identical.

Negative 16157 pI have have a huge graph consisting of well over 100000 keys so efficiency is a huge issue.

I copy [1, 2, 3] into a temporary dict so the changes to it wont affect my final dictionary that i return. Then I remove the key from the [1, 2, 3] and assign the key 1 to it. So Im left with 1  [2, 3] which is what I want but its taking too long because its iterating 100000 times.p  pMy final question is, can I improve this in any way so it runs fasterp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 16157 pI have a distributedfederated database structured as followsp  ol liThe databases are spread across three geographic locations nodesli liMultiple databases are clustered at each nodeli liThe relational databases are a mix of PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and MS SQL Server the nonrelational databases are either MongoDB or Cassandrali liLoose coupling within each node and across the node federation is achieved via RabbitMQ, with each node running a RabbitMQ brokerli ol  pI am implementing a readonly internode aggregation job system for jobs that span the node federation i.e. for jobs that are not local to a node. These jobs only perform get queries  they do not modify the databases.  If the results of the jobs are intended to go into one or more of the databases then this is accomplished by a separate job that is not part of the internode job system I am trying to optimize.  My objective is to minimize the network bandwidth required by these jobs first to minimize the internode  WAN bandwidth, then to minimize the intranode  LAN bandwidth I assume a uniform cost for each WAN link, and another uniform cost for each LAN link.  The jobs are not particularly timesensitive. I perform some CPU loadbalancing within a node but not between nodes.p  pThe amount of data transported across the WANLAN for the aggregation jobs is small relative to the amount of database writes that are local to a cluster or to a specific database, so it would not be practical to fully distribute the databases across the federation.p  pThe basic algorithm I use for minimizing network bandwidth isp  ol liGiven a job that runs on a set of data that is spread across the federation, the manager node sends a message to each the other nodes that contains the relevant database queries.li liEach node runs its set of queries, compresses them with gzip, caches them, and sends their compressed sizes to the manager node.li liThe manager moves to the node containing the plurality of the data specifically, to the machine within the cluster that has the most data and that has idle cores it requests the rest of the data from the other two nodes and from the other machines within the cluster, then it runs the job.li ol  pWhen possible the jobs use a divideandconquer approach to minimize the amount of data colocation that is needed.  For example, if the job needs to compute the sums of all Sales figures across the federation, then each node locally calculates its Sales sums which are then aggregated at the manager node rather than copying all of the unprocessed Sales data to the manager node.  However, sometimes such as when performing a join between two tables that are located at different nodes data colocation is needed.p  pThe first thing I did to optimize this was aggregate the jobs, and to run the aggregated jobs at ten minute epochs the machines are all running NTP, so I can be reasonably certain that every ten minutes means the same thing at each node.  The goal is for two jobs to be able to share the same data, which reduces the overall cost of transporting the data.p  ol liGiven two jobs that query the same table, I generate each jobs resultset, and then I take the intersection of the two resultsets.li liIf both jobs are scheduled to run on the same node, then the network transfer cost is calculated as the sum of the two resultsets minus the intersection of the two resultsets.li liThe two resultsets are stored to PostgreSQL temporary tables in the case of relational data or else to temporary Cassandra columnfamilies  MongoDB collections in the case of nosql data at the node selected to run the jobs the original queries are then performed against the combined resultsets and the data delivered is to the individual jobs. This step is only performed on combined resultsets individual resultset data is simply delivered to its job without first being stored on temporary tablescolumn familiescollections.li ol  pThis results in an improvement to network bandwidth, but Im wondering if theres a frameworklibraryalgorithm that would improve on this.  One option I considered is to cache the resultsets at a node and to account for these cached resultsets when determining network bandwidth i.e. trying to reuse resultsets across jobs in addition to the current set of prescheduled colocated jobs, so that e.g. a job run in one 10minute epoch can use a cached resultset from a previous 10minute resultset, but unless the jobs use the exact same resultsets i.e. unless they use identical where clauses then I dont know of a generalpurpose algorithm that would fill in the gaps in the resultset for example, if the resultset used the clause where N  3 and a different job needs the resultset with the clause where N  0 then what algorithm could I use to determine that I need to take the union of the original resultset and with the resultset with the clause where N  0 AND N lt 3  I could try to write my own algorithm to do this, but the result would be a buggy useless mess.  I would also need to determine when the cached data is stale  the simplest way to do this is to compare the cached datas timestamp with the lastmodified timestamp on the source table and replace all of the data if the timestamp has changed, but ideally Id want to be able to update only the values that have changed with perrow or perchunk timestamps.p

The total number of frames does not need to be set, but when it is set to the correct value, the header does not have to be patched up. It is best to first set all parameters, perhaps possibly the compression type, and then write audio frames using writeframesraw. When all frames have been written, either call writeframes or close to patch up the sizes in the header. The close method is called automatically when the class instance is destroyed.   import builtin  all  [open, openfp, Error]  class ErrorException     pass  WAVEFORMATPCM  0x0001 WAVEFORMATIEEEFLOAT

Negative 16157 pIve created a angularjs app which uses php for handling the database queries and enforcing an authentication schema.p  pWhen the user logs in into the app, he does so in php and php fetches the user data into a session. Then angularjs issues a http post request to a php page to read the fetched data. After that, whenever a user asks for data, angular issues a post to a php page.p  pIm considering using a framework for doing the authentication and the database queries in a better way. My security knowledge is primitive and I fear that I have mistakes in my code.p  pAfter doing a research I found laravel which seems straightforward and easy. Now my questions are p  ol liCan a php framework such as laravel do these things for meli liIs there something else I could use to have people authenticate and making sure that they are doing the CRUD operations they are authorized to do li liWhat are the keywords Im searching about, is it routing, is it php restful Im asking in order to do further research on the matter.li liIs there any other way in which a SPA could work with CRUD operations and Authenticating in a safe manner using phpli ol  pI know that the above questions are not programming questions per se, but I dont know where to ask because I feel I cannot communicate what I want to learn about thats why the keywords question above.p  pThank youp

Negative 16157 pI am developing an application using OpenSSL library. I am new to OpenSSL library. My application was working correctly until I tested it within network namespace. My application hangs at SSLConnect. I am using sockets in the blocking mode. I read somewhere that I should use nonblocking mode instead to solve the issue. So I switched from blocking sockets to nonblocking sockets but my code still gets stuck at SSLConnect method in the client. p  pI just have a simple clientserver program nothing fancy stuff. I have added SSL methods inside them to make them secure. Everything works perfectly when I run them inside terminal but when I switch to network namespace and run inside virtual network, the client code hangs at SSLConnect.

Negative 16157 pI am receiving the following error messagep  precodeServer Error in  Application.

Exception Details System.Security.SecurityException System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission  Source Error   An unhandled exception was generated during the execution of the current web request. Information regarding the origin and location of the exception can be identified using the exception stack trace below.

The site works great locally. I know the version of the .Net connector that my shared hosting environment uses, as that was another issue that I resolved and I was in communication with the hosting provider.p  pThe error is interesting. I can go to the default page, no issues, the very first time. I then go to bring up a popup dialog, which throws another error message box.p  pException has been thrown by the target of an invocation.p  pThe above is everything, except for the okay button.p  pI can bring up the first popup, a sign in dialog, which comes up. That dialog does not invoke MySQL. I bring up the second dialog, a registration dialog, which then throws the Exception has been thrown... message box. After that, I cannot go back into the signin dialog, as I get the Exception has... message box. If I press F5 to refresh the browser IE or Chrome, I get the error from above. The above error indicates MySQL and some permissions.p  pI am suspecting that the Exception has been thrown... error is the result of the same MySQL, just the page has memory. Closing the browser window and launching the browser window again does not help, although on Chrome that works, just the browser window there really has to close down all the way.p  pI am in a shared hosting environment, so I have access to basically nothing, so I do not have access to any logs, at least that I can think of.p  pOne final thought that may or may not be relevant. Yesterday and previous days my development work was done on a system with Windows 7 Professional and Visual Studio 2012 Professional all latest service packs and updates, whereas today I am working at a different computer of mine, which is a system with Windows 8 Professional and Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate all latest service packs and updates on the OS and VS. I was reading some other posts on unrelated issues that people with VS2012 Ultimate had issues, so I am not sure that has anything to do with it, but that is something that changed from yesterday to today.p  pYes, I deleted everything off of the server and uploaded everything anew. I did a clean solution first, built the release, and then published. I still received the same error.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 16157 pIs there a way to make a schedule agent that runs on the specific dates and information that the user entered in a profile document p  pTwo Scenariosp  pA The field being used from the profile document has the properties Can have multiple values activated. I would like the agent to run whatever the values are inside that field. The field contains the specific dates.p  pB There are multiple fields like Schedule Daily or Once a month and the likes which is almost the same as when you create the schedule for the agent that would be used by the agent as the properties for scheduling and running the agent.p  pThis is possible by always running a scheduled agent and checking the data from the profile document then just check if the agent should continue or not but is there another way which would be better than the one mentioned earlier since it required the agent to always run most of the time. I would like to create the setup of the agent based on profile document.p  pThanks a lot in advance.p

Negative 16157 pSome context Im making a chrome extension that will make use of a large list potentially thousands of image urls. The list will have urls for many image types.p  pI want to give users the ability to browse these images by seeing the actual image, and not just seeing the url. Right now I just iterate through the list, and for each url, I attach an  element to a scrollable element. This results in a a scrollable list of images. Some are gifs, some png, some jpeg etc. Im worried that if the list gets very large, there will be a lot of lag and the process will take up a lot of bandwidth. p  pIs there a good way to do something like this efficiently ie. reduce lag and loading timesp  pIdeally I would have a thumbnail for each url.p

Negative 16157 pSometimes I have wanted to place my Mac files on a USB thumb drive or portable external hard drive to share with an MSDOS, Linux, Unix or Microsoft Windows user, or use them on a nonApple product such as a TV or media player.  The problem is that all disk devices including USB sticks that have been attached to my MacOS computer will have innumerable files placed on them by MacOS that are invisible on the MacOS computer. These files are invisible on the Mac because their file names begin with a period . or dot character followed by the name of a regular file on the device e.g. .fileFoo is created in reference to fileFoo.  When I then eject the USB drive from my Mac and attempt to use it with a nonApple product, it will not function correctly.  For example, the device may freeze up or list many files and folders that cannot be used.  This automatic creation of all the extra invisible files can also cause a nearly full external MSDOS, Linux, Windows or Unix drive to act strangely when connected to a Mac computer, because there wont be enough space on the drive for all the MacOS hidden files.p  pI traced these problems to all those invisible dot files. I found some solutions online but none did exactly what I wanted so I created an AppleScript combined with a Shell script to solve this problem. Ill post it as an Answer to this question in case its helpful for anyone else. But my real Question is, would anyone like to improve this script with error handling and comments or post an alternative perhaps all done with a single shell script or AppleScriptp  p[Edit] OK, Im unable to post the Answer I created until 8 hours have passed, so Ill do that tomorrow.

Negative 16157 pIm new to AS3 and still trying wrap my head around it. Im trying to program a very simple platformer. At present, Im trying to make the player appear to be moving by means of moving the background behind him. So, Ive made a separate .as file to contain the simple logic for making the background move. Its title is BG.as and Ive been able to import a file with that exact name before without any issue on that front, but now it is being temperamental with me. Ive gone into my AS3 Prefs in flash and set the file paths for the root folder, the folder containing the root folder, and even the folder holding the documents themselves. Both the .as file and the .fla file are in the same folder, but still I get an Error 5001 declaring that the name of BG does not reflect the file of the location.

Negative 16157 pIm trying to figure out the right pieces to implement a highly available amp failover setup for a java based server application netty. The TCP connections would ideally be up for months if not years they are used in server to server comms and would only ever need to go down if the remote server disconnected or due to a uncontrolled network problem. The goal is to not have any single points of failure. p  pThe data within the socket connections looks very similar to protobuf data structures. Its not HTTP.p  pThus far Ive been looking at keepalived and HAProxy, but neither seem to allow redirectingfailovering a persistent TCP session to a different backend server without disconnecting the front end session. p  pWhat im trying to figure out is what would be running on the FE1 and BE1 systems as in the belowp  precode                VIP                              FE1    ltVRRPgt    FE2                                                                                                                                                                               BE1A       BE1B                                                                                                                                      BE2A       BE2B               codepre  pExternal servers connect via the VIP to the active front end FE system, which then establishes the TCP connection to the active backend 1 BE1 system. Or if a TCP proxy does this connects to both BE1 systems, and sends traffic to one system. p  pThe BE1 servers run a custom java app which handles ensuring the requests and responses end up at the appropriate BE2 system. This can be modified in any way to handle the connectionstream from the FE servers if need be.p  pWhat Im looking for is if one of the BE1 systems goes down intentionally or not is the FE server redirectsreestablishes a connection to the other BE1 system without any disconnect to the connection to the external VIP from the remote server. Ie, transparent failover of persistent TCP connection. p  pAs mentioned before Ive looked at keepalived  HAProxy, and from what I can tell they would not work  unless Ive missed a pluginmod to them that might do the trick. p  pWhat options are there for what can run on the FE layer or is there something that can run on the BE1 layer which can handle the failover and notice to java of the socket being movedresumed on the alternate system ie can LVS or tcpcp be used with java  Ive not found much talk about it. p  pThanksp

Negative 16157 pEditp  pAlright I will edit my question, this time I know now what I really need. My original questions stems for the lack of information that I need to solve my problem. Of course It has something to do with my code, my bad. But just an airplane crashing into the land, I need what info on the plane is doing before the crash and what the pilot is doing before the crash.p  pSimilar to what I need, if I have a main which calls function1 and function1 calls function2 and on function2 causes crash, so on stack function2, function1, main. Of course there is a crash so I need to see like, function1, main. I do know for the fact that function1 work so well and commented out function2 call from function1. Great It works like a charm and by GOD I know there is something wrong with function2 My problem is solved There must be some kind of feature in cb which allows me to see the list of functions being called in order. That very crucial information I need in squashing this runtime error. Is there some kind of black box or I am just delusional Well I could always go back to my backup and just use my smelly code and just finish the project regardless. Damn this just suppose to be a simple refactoring that went so wrong this time. p  pI am using Windows 7, g 4.7.0 and CodeBlocks version 12.p  pAlso note, it is also a project with many files and dependent on library along with its modules. I could use the console thingy and third party apps but I do not understand it and if I do I do not know how to do that for windows. At least I need to see which line was executed last before it crashes, even that small information could give me an insight onto something I overlooked when I refactored this code.p  pEDIT Also if it helps here is what my stack trace looks likep  precode0 0040C638    1 ABABABAB    2 FEEEFEEE    3       codepre  pWhere is the previous call Where is main Where are those functions called during routine All I see this, I cannot solve the error if it is like this.p  pAny help will be great. p

Negative 16157 pI am using a VPTree to optimize some KNearest neighbors algorithms.p  pA VPTree requires that a distance function satisfy the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTriangleinequality relnofollowtriangle inequalitya.p  pThe triangle inequality states that the following must be truep  precodedistancex,z lt distancex,y  distancey,z codepre  pOne of the features used in our distance function is geographic distance, in meters, which is calculated with floating point arithmetic. I found that this feature has been violating the triangle inequality due to inexact floating point calculations.p  pFor Examplep  precodex  90,180 y  90,162 z  81,144 distancex,z  1005162.6564502382 distancex,y  1.2219041408558764E10 distancey,z  1005162.656450238 distancex,y  distancey,z  1005162.6564502381 codepre  pObviously the triangle inequality has failed in this case.p  pI was messing around and found that if I round the distance in meters DOWN to the next integer, ie Math.floor in java, and then add 5, the result seems to all of a sudden satisfy the triangle inequality in all cases I have tested.p  pI have tested every latlong combination that is a multiple of 10, ie 206 combinations.p  pAfter this change we get the following results for the example abovep  precodex  90,180 y  90,162 z  81,144 distancex,z  1005167 distancex,y  5 distancey,z  1005167 distancex,y  distancey,z  1005172 codepre  pObviously the triangle inequality no longer fails in this case.p  pThis seems perfect since 5 meters really isnt significant in our use case.p  pstrongAm I just forcing this to work and am still violating some requirement of the triangle inequality or some requirement of VPTrees Is this something that is known property of floatsstrongp  pNote that simply rounding DOWN without adding 5 does not work.p  pFor Examplep  precodex  90,180 y  81,180 z  72,180 distancex,z  2009836.0 distancex,y  1005162.0 distancey,z  1004673.0 distancex,y  distancey,z  2009835.0 codepre  pAnd adding 5p  precodex  90,180 y  81,180 z  72,180 distancex,z  2009841.0 distancex,y  1005167.0 distancey,z  1004678.0 distancex,y  distancey,z  2009845.0 codepre  pAlso note that I have found that this works for any kind of floating point arithmetic, not just geo distance. For example a distance function that calculates a percentage of some maximum value with a single division operation, as long as you always round to a specific number of digits and add 5 to the last digit.p

Negative 16157 pIm dealing with a fairly largescale C application which occasionally hits a SQL Server deadlock. I cant figure out whats causing it. My bandaid solution for now isp  p1 Catch the SqlException.p  p2 See if the error code is 1205 i.e. deadlock.p  p3 If it is, Sleep for a couple of seconds and retry the entire transaction. You can assume the previously failed transaction was successfully rolled back.p  pThis works. The problem occurs only once or twice per week so the performance penalty is trivial. It still bugs me that its occurring though. How do I figure out emwhyem it is occurringp  pI know a deadlock occurs when two or more SQL Server threads are contending for the same resources. I obviously know which one of my transactions LOSES that battle. Its always the same query. But Id like to know which which transaction is WINNING the battle. Maybe its the same code block. Maybe not. I have no way to tell. Is there some special tool I should use to find the deadlocks sourcep  pMore info The losing transaction isnt doing anything particularly exotic just two large deletes via ExecuteNonQuery followed by two large bulk inserts using the SqlBulkCopy class  all in the same SqlTransaction. Both READERCOMMITTEDSNAPSHOT and ALLOWSNAPSHOTISOLATION are turned on. There are no humans making adhoc queries against the database. My application is the only user.p  pAgain, this works flawlessly 99.99 of the time... the deadlock is quite rare. It manifests  only once or twice per week.p

Module is used to decode codeH.264code file into byte array using codelibavcodeccode, which is in precompiled shared dlls.p  pWhen I played around in plain JNI passing codeStringcode to JNI and return codebyte[]code back, I had no problem loading my DLL module.  But when I added reference to codeavformat.dllcode, my dll wont load causing codeunsatisfied link error Cant find dependant librariescode.p  pI scoped codeavformatcode using codeDependencyWalkercode. It depends on codeadvapi.dllcode which depends on several dlls reporting as missing. On of them is codeAPIMSWINCOREKERNEL32PRIVATEL111.DLLcode. This dll is really missing on my Win installation. p  pSo, now I am confused about 2 things p  p1, Why does MS provided codeadvapi.dllcode depend on dll which is not part of the system. p  p2, When I previously tried using codeavformatcode library in form of standalone Win32 app exe, codeDependencyWalkercode reported the same missing dlls, but it executed decoded frames without any problem. How is this possible if I am missing its dependencyp

Negative 16157 pI have a few Strings like sop  blockquote   ptext TAGAtextTAGBtext text TAGAtextTAGBtext text ...p blockquote  pOrp  blockquote   ptext TAGAtextTAGCtextTAGD TAGAtextTAGDtext text text ...p blockquote  pOr maybe evenp  blockquote   pTAGBtextTAGAtext text TAGDtextTAGBtextTAGAtext text text ...p blockquote  pThere is no fixed pattern to the alternating of the nonbraced and braced groups, and it can start with either sort.p  pA valid braced group in this context implies that the braced group has at least TAGA strongandstrong one of the other TAGs TAGs will always have the same name and uppercase. Only TAGA through TAGD exists. Each TAG must be followed by a colon  and at least one character after that any character. Since each group will require at least 2 TAGs, there will always be at least one pipe  seperating them, and additional pipes for each other TAG included. There is also no order to the TAGs in the brace.p  pThere are 2 things Id need to do here with regex. Firstly, I need a regex that can determine if there are any valid braced groups. Secondly, a regex that can be looped over with Javas Matcher.find for each valid braced group.p  pIm not as concerned with capturing the nonbraced groups, but itd still be nice if thats possible. Just tell me if Ive left something vague, will try to clarify, and thanks in advance for any helpp
Negative 16157 pIm a JavaScript developer who gets weak in the knees when he sees regex. p  pBut right now, Im working on a side project that seems to require it. p  pI want to create an array of important words there are around 250 of them, and then scan through a giant document looking for and storing each occurrence of an important word for analysis and further manipulation. p  pI have no idea where to start or what to Google when it comes to the regex part of this, nor do I know the expertise required for what Im trying to do. p  pIf I can get the important words individually into an array, I know what to do. Its the steps leading up to that that Im confused about.p  pAny basic advice or direction would be much appreciated. p  pThanksp

Negative 16157 pI am looking at a rather large database..  Lets say I have an exported flag on the product records.br If I want an estimate of how many products I have with the flag set to false, I can do a call something like this Product.whereexported  false.count.. .p  pThe problem I have is even the count takes a long time, because the table of 1 million products is being written to.  More specifically exports are happening, and the value Im interested in counting is ever changing. p  pSo Id like to do a dirty read on the table... Not a dirty read always.  And I 100 dont want all subsequent calls to the database on this connection to be dirty.br But for this one call, dirty is what Id like.p  pOh..

I could also import the projects into Eclipse. Now in the chapter Launching and Debugging, I try to create the launch configuration as described. However, I cannot see my bundles. Beside the bundles under Target Platform, there are no other bundles listed. How can I make my bundles visible to the list in the OSGI Framework run configuration  What I want is an easy way to test and debug the bundles from withing Eclipse, i.e. without having to move them to a separate OSGi installation etc. So that tutorial looks exactly like what I need. p  pIm using Eclipse Juno, with Eclipse Plugin Development installed.  Moving the project from some direcory into a subdirectory of the workspace did not help, nor did restarting Eclipse as recommended in the tutorial. The bundles have no dependency on any part of Eclipse. p

Negative 16157 pI have a pojo list within a pojo list that I am trying to use in a dynamic way in a data table with jsf 2.2.6 and primefaces 4.0. I think I am close but I havent been able to make it work.p  pThe idea is to configure multiple rounds of a golf competition. Main list registrations is all players with info like name, handicap factor, etc.  The List within the registration list is tee times, start hole, etc per round where it could be anywhere from 14 rounds and I only want to display one at a time in columns of the pdataTable. The user would click the round they want to see, using the selectOneButton and it would dynamically change to that data. p  pThe key ideas are 1 selectOneButton and ajax to trigger the change of a property identifying the index to the table. 2 JSTL to help make the EL expressions shorter and more readable  3 Typical datatable to walk through the primary list 4 EL putting it all together to try and extract the right round based on the index chosen by the button.

Negative 16157 pMy tomcat application randomly invalidates the session information and the user if forced to log back in again.

Any idea what could be wrong Is there a way to prevent thisp

Blog Posts and Webservice Tags.p  pOur blog posts are populated by a number of webservices from a number of different providers. Test Service, Example Service and Another Service for example. However, these webservices are very inconsistent theyll send over a combination of tags, and no two posts are guaranteed to be the same.p  pSo, weve created a table called Webservice Tags which is designed to log each of these occurrances. This way we can identify that in the examples Blog Title 3 was sent by Another Service, Blog Title 2 was sent by Test Service etc.p  pIm developing reports to show how many posts we get from each of our web services. So for each blog post, I need to identify the web service and get the web service name thats associated with it. We have multiple blogs, each with their own web services some may share a tag, so this report needs to be isolated to each individual blog.p  pHeres the query in Eloquentp  precodequery  DBtableblogposts     gtjoinwebservicetags, functionjoin use blog          joingtonblogposts.tag, , webservicetags.webservicetag         gtwherewebservicetags.blogid, , bloggtid          gtaddSelectwebservicetags.webservicename AS name     gtaddSelectDBrawCOUNTblogposts.id AS count     gtwhereblogposts.blogid, , bloggtid     gtgroupBywebservicetags.webservicename     gtget codepre  pThis query was fine whilst the Webservice sent a consistent tag. Now however there are different tags per web service and this report needs to count them all equally.p  pHeres my amendment, but its not working as expectedp  precodegtjoinwebservicetags, functionjoin use blog      joingtonblogposts.tag, LIKE, DBrawCONCAT, webservicetags.webservicetag,      gtwherewebservicetags.blogid, , bloggtid  codepre  pIm not getting any matches in the query through this method.p  pThe query aims to join any field to the SELECT where the blogposts.tag is within the comma separated list of webservicetags.p  pIs there a way to do this more effectivelyp  pstrongExplanation on the codeblogidcode relationshipstrongp  pThis system manages multiple blogs, as well as the posts within those blogs. A webservice may be applicable to one blog, but not the other, which is why the codeblogidcode is associated witih webservices as well as the individual posts. There are things like commission percentages that are associated with a webservice, and Test Webservice may offer 10 for Blog A, and 12 for Blog B, so they are essentially separate.p
Negative 16157 pIm trying to catch the back keypress hardware so I can prevent it exists my game but shows the game menu.p  pI tried overriding the OnBackPressed in my AndroidGameActivity but it doesnt trigger when pressing back. My game exists .p  pSo I digged a bit deeper and saw that the on the Window member of the Game object you can use SetOnKeyListener.  Im now having a OnKey method in my listener class which get triggered at a keypress. That is nice to react on keypresses but it still exits my app because it didnt really override it, it is only a listener.  It still goes in the the AndroidGameActivity OnKeyDown and checks if its Back and then exits the app.p  pI saw that [a hrefhttpsgithub.comdineshkummarcMonoGame2.5.1.00blobmasterMonoGame.FrameworkAndroidAndroidGameWindow.cs relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdineshkummarcMonoGame2.5.1.00blobmasterMonoGame.FrameworkAndroidAndroidGameWindow.csa already has a OnKeyDown override. You can see there it exits the app if back is pressed.p  pSo how can I prevent it from exiting when clicken the back hardware key Should I override OnDestroy and check the gamestate p  pAny help is welcome.p

Negative 16157 pI am writing a small C code to take some user input, which would be a string. Now I read at a lot of places that using gets will be very unsafe as it may lead to buffer overflow attacks. And in most of the places what I found as an alternative was using fgets instead, which is safer as far as buffer overflows are concerned. p  pNow I have a problem scenario, where in I do not know the buffer size before hand. It just can not be determined. It could be anything. So in this case, will fgets be handy p  pAlso, what is wrong if I make use of gets, as shown below, to solve this problem p  precodechar  tempbuffertoholduserinput  NULL cahr  actualbufferthatstoresuserinput  NULL int lengthofuserinput 0   taking user input, irrespective of its length using gets   getstempbuffertoholduserinput   now finding the length of the user input string and allocating the required number of bytes for proper safe usage   lengthofuserinputlengthtempbuffertoholduserinput actualbufferthatstoresuserinput  charmalloclengthofuserinputsizeofchar strcpyactualbufferthatstoresuserinput, tempbuffertoholduserinput   and now we work with our actual buffer  codepre  pSo does the above usage of gets still have buffer overflow problem  Because, in the above we are not declaring a fixed size buffer at all in the first place... so no buffer overflow is what I am expecting. p  pPlease correct me if I am missing out on something p
Negative 16157 pIt seems to me there are two ways to store an attachment in a NotesDocument.p  pEither as a RichTextField or as a MIME Part.p  pIf they are stored as RichText you can do stuff like p  pdocument.getAttachmentfileNamep  pThat does not seem to work for an attachment stored as a MIME Part.

Not really my intent.p  pWhat happened is I lost some of my Small pictures so I need to rebuild them from the Original pictures that are now stored as MIME Part.  So my ultimate goal is to get it from the NotesDocument into a Java Buffered Image.p  pI think I have the code to do what I want but I just simply cant figure out how to get the attachment off the document and then into a Java Buffered Image.p  pBelow is some rough code Im working with.  My goal is to pass in the document with the original picture.  I already have the fileName because I stored that out in metaData. But I dont know how to get that from the document itself.

Negative 16157 pI have created a basic plugin using a Codepen that I found which allows for sticky elements to be displayed on site. p  pIve not written a plugin before and I seem to be getting confused with variables var varname, var varname etc. and then also when referring back to them.

Negative 16157 pI am in the happy position of replacing a Windows 8 Metro app with a Chrome packaged app. For the time being, it needs to mimic the look and feel of the Metro app. The main page consists of multiple webviews arranged horizontally with a large amount of horizontal scrolling possible. I have run into a problem when attempting to scroll horizontally using a touch device. If the scroll gesture starts on a webview, it is capturing the scroll event and preventing the host from scrolling. Overflow is hidden on all of the webviews. As they form the bulk of the content on the page then the valid scroll targets for the host are limited.p  pThe webview contents are interactive so I cant get away with placing a transparent overlay over the scrollable content to capture the event, at least not without some way to propagate the clickstouches through to the webviews themselves.p  pAny ideas on how this could be achievedp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 16157 pIm using Matplotlib to produce a large batch of plots order of thousands. Ill frequently tweak minor things in the code that produces the plots, but the changes will often only affect a few plots. p  pWhen I push new plots to a common repository, Id like to use something like codersynccode or codediffcode to identify which plots have actually changed. Unfortunately, running codediff newplot.pdf oldplot.pdfcode emalwaysem identifies the files as different, even if emnothingem about the plotting script has changed. p  pWhen I output to code.pngcode the files are identical. When I output to an code.epscode the output is nearly identical, but running diff shows that a few lines have been swapped. I suspect there are two reasons for the differencep  ol liA pdf stores metadata, including a timestamp. li liSome vector graphics may look identical even without the same description i.e. a line could be drawn from right to left or from left to right. Id expect matplotlib to be deterministic, but it clearly does things slightly differently in the code.epscode instance, so I guess not.li ol  pIs there some way to turn off code.pdfcode metadata, and either force a more deterministic drawing method out of matplotlib or feed the files to a diff tool that sees them as identicalp

You can ask IntelliJ IDEA to use the same directory as your NetBeans project is using. IntelliJ IDEA then adds .iml file idea module file and .idea configuration directory.

And, after you can select area to capture and save to the image file.p  pI just wanted to know how this program create that kind of transparent window. Actually, I searched the various way to make window as transparent window. There are about 34 ways to create that.  WSTRANSPARENT, Layered Style, OnColor Message Processing, Etc...p  pHowever, according to my analysis on this program, it doesnt use these technics...p  pI also looked into the resources, but the dialog which cover whole desktop window has WSVISIBLE and WSPOPUP style only. If I add WSBORDER or WSDLGFRAME style, then it cannot create the transparent window. So, I tried to make my own program with a dialog which has same dialog template of the capture program. But it failed.p  pLastly, I monitored the program by APIMonitor. But, Whenever the program create a dialog with createDialogIndirectParam API,  the dialog created and stayed as transparent status from creation moment.p  pDoes anybody has some thought about this program...p  pYou can download the capture program from the link FastCapturep  phttps www.mediafire.comrssbh9bz9wvmybwp

Not as good because there is no guarantee that my widget will be on the home screen page when the display is turned on, so the message may have disappeared by the time the user flicks across to the page where my widget resides.p

Negative 16157 pIve been struggling trying to get a hrefhttpplugins.compzets.comanimatescroll relnofollowRam Swaroops animateScroll.jsa to work with a hrefhttpwww.telerik.comappbuilder relnofollowTeleriks AppBuildera.  p  pI need the nice finegrained control of animateScroll, like pre and post scroll event handling, animation easing and controllable scrolling speed .  However, no matter what I do the scrolling behavior wont actually happen, even though the jquery animate code that does the work line 162  of animateScroll emdoesem seem to fire, at as near as I can tell by instrumenting with console.log.  p  pTo be clear the behavior I am after is the method in animatescroll where you are scrolling emwithinem an existing element as opposed to the default behavior of scrolling the whole page.  Scrolling within an element is achieved referencing the containing element as a parameter. Effectively, this approach turns an arbitrary containing div into a scroller and can be seen in the a hrefhttpsgithub.comramswaroopanimatescroll.js relnofollowdemoa under the parameter section.p  pI have a large appbuilder project, so I made an essentially empty appbuilder project from Teleriks demo templates and I get the same result.  My assumption is this issue would also affect since Phone and Cordova since they are very, very similar.  If anyone is able to help with this Ill do my best to submit the tweaked version under the same MIT license to the various cordovaphonegap plugin directories.  Its a really nice scroller  if I can get it to work in a hybrid mobile app context.p  pAny suggestions or help appreciated.

Negative 16157 pI am trying to save a numpy array of dimensions 128x128 pixels into a grayscale image.

Negative 16157 pHow can I place an overlay over my page, while selecting specific elements to be placed ontop of the overlayp  pFor example, place a dark overlay over your entire page and let a button be on top of it.

But for some reason, my inner div still shows up below the overlay instead of ontop, despite having a higher zindex than the overlay.p  pHow can I position these elements so codeinnercode appears ontop of codeoverlaycodep  pstrongHow introJS seems to work... against the zindex specstrongp  pIntroJS has an overlay with zindex 99998, then the highlighted element has classes applied to it that give it codeposition relative zindex 99999code.

Negative 16157 pSmarty lets you use PHP tags but for some reason sessionstart does not work in Smarty. I could not find out how.p  pI cant pull out a session variable in a PHP file from a smarty template.p  pWhat I need is very simple. Pass data from Smarty TPL to a php file. Same server, same domain, same host. Some people asked this before but exactly the other way around. Notice that I dont want to pass data from PHP to Smarty, but the other way around. p  pUsing get, post or cookies is unsafe and a database would be overkill since all I need is make sure the USER A is still the USER A when he lands on the php page. Sessions are perfect and they are exactly for this, but since I cannot start a php session in Smarty it seems there is no way to connect them together. Using curl with a post command like this was an external page would very overkill, because both pages are in the same server, and both are executing exactly the same php server, so why is this so hard Something like this should be simple but it seems its not. Not at least without exposing this to the user with get or post.p  pDoes someone know a safe way to do this or connect themp

Negative 16157 pI have somewhat of a thought problem, where Im not sure if what I already built can be done a lot more efficiently, so thats why Ill share my problem here. to be clear, everything I have built works, Im just looking to make it more efficient.p  pI have a webapp made with MVC amp SQL which has a login system etc for users. A user has a status, which is an enum, and can be active, blocked etc and is stored in the database along with other userdata.p  pWithin my webapp I have made a custom AuthorizeAttr. for authorizing users on every call made applied as a global filter.p  pHowever, the normal authentication is based on the cookie, which does not change when I would change the userstatus in the database. For instance, users can deactivate another user in the same group when being Admin. These database changes are not taking immediate effect since by default the authorization only verifies the cookie, and the cookie is based on the status when logging in.p  pTo fix this issue, I added some additional logic to my authorizationAttr, which on every request calls the database for the current user status the enum, and then simply does some checks whether the user is allowed to continue, or a redirect is required. p  pCalling the database on every request seems even just for 1 enum seems to be a bit taxing on the serverdb especially when the webapp would grow in popularity  lots of users.p  pOne idea I thought of was to cache the enum in session cache but for short periods of time like 60 seconds, this would save some database calls, but obviously the user can still use the webapp for max 60seconds after being deactivated. p  pI could be wrong in thinking that these database calls are actually that taxing of course.p  pAny ideas for improvement Thanksp

Negative 16157 pI am very new with ASP.NET. I need help understanding the basic procedures of how a developer publishes their site to their hosting server, and then once its compiled and published, how does another developer someone who does not have the original files, edit some of the code behind files.p  pFor example, Developer A creates a site, uploads it to the server and it works great. We hire a new remote developer Developer B and he needs to work on a .cs file, does he need to get a copy of the entire site, to his local machine if so, does he need to reverse the compiling process to get thos .cs files back p  pI am a PHP developer, and since theres no compiling needed, I dont worry about .dlls nor about compiling at all. This would truly help me understand ASP.NET with the hopes that it can also help others like me.p  pPlease help. Thank you in advance.p

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at HampdenSydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum The Extremes of Good and Evil by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml

Negative 16157 pIn a Xamarin project, I set the linker behaviour to Link all references. When doing that, assemblies get optimized by removing unused members. One problem, its not actually aware that we need them for reflection. I know there is the Preserve attribute that we can put to tell the linker to keep all symbols in the class, but what if the assembly is a DLL or just not an iOS project doesnt reference the monotouch assemblies, and cant. Is there a way I can set all classes from a library to preserve, ignore it, or only set certain classes to be optimized reverse PreserveAttribute p

Negative 16157 pIm using the strongKafkaSpoutstrong spout to read from all 6 partitions on a kafka topic. The first bolt in the topology has to convert the byte stream into a struct via IDL definition, lookup a value in a db and pass these values to a second bolt which writes it all into strongcassandrastrong.p  pThere are several issues occurringp  ol liMany strongfailstrongs from the kafka spout. li liThe first bolt reports capacity of  2.0 from the storm ui. li ol  pIve tried to increase the parallelism but it appears that storm will only accept 11 from the strongkafkaspoutstrong to the first bolt. Im guessing that 1 is a result of timeouts from the first bolt.  p  pWhat I want to do have the kafkaspouts limited to 1  kafka partition able to send their bits to a random first bolt so that I can run many more of these than the  of spouts. The first and second bolts would be 11 but the spout to first bolt should be 1many.p  pCurrently Im using the strongLocalOrShuffleGroupingstrong to connect between strongspoutboltboltstrong.p  hr  pEditp  pRereading the storms docs I see this passagep  blockquote   pShuffle grouping Tuples are randomly distributed across the bolts tasks in a way such that each bolt is guaranteed to get an equal number of tuples.p blockquote  pYet when I look at the load on the executors for my first bolt I see everything concentrated on 6 of them  seemingly emignoringem the other 24.p  pIm missing some large clue here.p

Negative 16157 pBoolean in C are 1 byte variables. And because bool are shortcuts for the Boolean class, I would expect that the strongampstrong, strongstrong operations have been overridden to let them work with the boolean types but Im not so sure about it. There is nothing like strongampampstrong or strongstrong to be used.p  pHeres my question, doing something likep  precodebool result  condition result amp condition1 result amp condition2 codepre  pwill work but is it just because the bool will be em00000000em for emfalseem and em00000001em for emtrueem or because underneath the bool class will use something like strongampampstrong and strongstrong when the previous are called Is it actually safe to use the previous notations or is better to usep  precodebool result  condition result  result ampamp condition1 result  result ampamp condition2 codepre  pto avoid any strange behaviorp  pPlease note that conditions could be something like emA  Bem or any other possible check that will return a bool.p
Negative 16157 pI have seen in a few questionsanswers on how to detect the OS version of Win 8.1 and 10.0 using VerifyVersionInfo since GetVersionEx no longer works without manifesting, but this only allows me to check if the OS is a version you pass to the function. It does not return this info to me. For example, with GetVersionEx it would tell me the major, minor, and build versions, but with VerifyVersionInfo I have to essentially ask Is the OS version 6.3 or greater or Is the OS version 10.0 or greater since GetVersionEx now returns 6.2 for the OS version even if it is actually 6.3 or 10.0.p  pThis is fine in that I can easily add this check to my code, but I now have no way of getting the build version since VerifyVersionInfo does not tell me this.

Negative 16157 pI try to test an angular application on which adding data can only be done by files drag and drop from OS explorer. I understand that files drag and drop cant be directly test by webdriver because explorer is not a part of browser.p  pAnyway, I need a way to adding some data to my app to test it. I thought of different approaches.  The first one was to directly call my backend REST API to add the data. I tried this approache by following this blog post a hrefhttpsquirrel.plblog20140115directserverhttpcallsinprotractor relnofollowhttpsquirrel.plblog20140115directserverhttpcallsinprotractora and I can send data to the server. But many checks and transformation on the data are done by my frontend app on drop, before to send data to server, and with this approache I cant use them. These checks and transformations are already tests in Unit Test, but it is a little bit frustrating to have to rewrite these in my test to manage my data files...p  pstrongSo, I thought that it would be great if I can use my validation files directly by calling controller function which handle dropped files. With this approache, I skip only the drag and drop part but I test with e2e all process which are made after drop.strong It would be really nice, but I cant figure out how to do this... I dont even know if its possible to do something like that...p  pAny advice would be great p

Negative 16157 pIm playing around with promises and Im having trouble with an asynchronous recursive promise. p  pThe scenario is an athlete starts running the 100m, I need to periodically check to see if they have finished and once they have finished, print their time.p  pemEdit to clarifyem  p  pIn the real world the athlete is running on a server. codestartRunningcode involves making an ajax call to the server. codecheckIsFinishedcode also involves making an ajax call to the server.

Negative 16157 pim building a stop watch with a digital and analog clock but having trouble with printing the digital clock value mainly because im unsure how to pass the string to the FXML. p  pwhy is it that when i try to us iddigitalText for the textfield in the fxml the program fails but if i were to write it using a text0000 it will work properlyjust with a text with 0000 though so no updating the digital clock of course. i would have hoped giving it the id would print the value inside it.p  pthe controller p  precodepackage tds7xbstopwatchfxml  import java.awt.TextField import java.net.URL import java.util.ResourceBundle import javafx.animation.Animation import javafx.animation.KeyFrame import javafx.animation.Timeline import javafx.event.ActionEvent import javafx.fxml.FXML import javafx.fxml.Initializable import javafx.scene.image.Image import javafx.scene.image.ImageView import javafx.util.Duration  public class FXMLDocumentController implements Initializable    FXML private ImageView clockFace  FXML private ImageView hand  FXML private TextField digitalText          String digital  Double rotation  0.0 Integer ms  00 Integer mm  00  Timeline timeline  new Timeline         new KeyFrameDuration.millis1000, ActionEvent actionEvent gt          updateTimer         updateDigital             FXML private void stopButtonActionEvent event      timeline.stop   FXML private void startButtonActionEvent event    timeline.play    FXML private void resetButtonActionEvent event          rotation  0.0         ms  0         mm  0         hand.setRotate0         digital0000         timeline.stop   public void updateTimer      ms  1000     if ms gt 60000          ms  00         mm           rotation  ms  60000.0  360.0     hand.setRotaterotation   public void updateDigital    ifms1000lt10 ampamp mmlt10        digital0  String.valueOfmm    0   String.valueOfms1000          ifms1000gt10 ampamp mm lt10         digital0  String.valueOfmm       String.valueOfms1000          ifmmgt10 ampamp ms1000lt10        digital  String.valueOfmm    0   String.valueOfms1000                ifmmgt10 ampamp ms1000gt10        digital  String.valueOfmm       String.valueOfms1000                        Override public void initializeURL url, ResourceBundle rb      clockFace.setImagenew Imagethis.getClass.getResourceAsStreamclockface.png     hand.setImagenew Imagethis.getClass.getResourceAsStreamhand.png         timeline.setCycleCountAnimation.INDEFINITE     digitalText.setTextdigital       codepre  pi know there are better ways to implement the code for the digital clock but mainly i want to know about passing a changing string to be printed. the digitalText.setTextdigital will cause it to crashp  pand the fxmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt  ltimport javafx.scene.text.gt ltimport javafx.scene.image.gt ltimport java.lang.gt ltimport java.net.gt ltimport java.util.gt ltimport javafx.scene.gt ltimport javafx.scene.control.gt ltimport javafx.scene.layout.gt  ltAnchorPane idAnchorPane prefHeight600.0 prefWidth600.0 styleClassmainFxmlClass xmlnshttpjavafx.comjavafx8 xmlnsfxhttpjavafx.comfxml1 fxcontrollertds7xbstopwatchfxml.FXMLDocumentControllergt     ltstylesheetsgt         ltURL valuestopwatchui.css gt     ltstylesheetsgt    ltchildrengt       ltStackPane layoutY94.0 prefHeight150.0 prefWidth200.0 AnchorPane.bottomAnchor0.0 AnchorPane.leftAnchor0.0 AnchorPane.rightAnchor0.0 AnchorPane.topAnchor175.0gt          ltchildrengt             ltImageView fxidclockFace fitHeight400.0 fitWidth400.0 pickOnBoundstrue preserveRatiotrue gt             ltImageView fxidhand fitHeight400.0 fitWidth400.0 pickOnBoundstrue preserveRatiotrue gt          ltchildrengt       ltStackPanegt       ltTextField fxiddigitalText alignmentCENTER editablefalse layoutX204.0 layoutY123.0 prefHeight43.0 prefWidth194.0gt          ltfontgt             ltFont nameArial size23.0 gt          ltfontgt       ltTextFieldgt       ltButton fxidstopbutton layoutX280.0 layoutY75.0 onActionstopButton textStop gt       ltButton fxidstartbutton layoutX204.0 layoutY75.0 onActionstartButton textStart gt       ltButton fxidresetbutton layoutX353.0 layoutY75.0 onActionresetButton textReset gt    ltchildrengt ltAnchorPanegt codepre
Negative 16157 pIm doing research on generating planets for a game engine Im planning to code, and I was wondering what would be the best approach to procedurally generate a planet. In terms of performance. So far Ive seen the a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comYP4an.png relnofollowIcospherea and a hrefhttpacko.netfilesmakingworldsplanets1cubemap.png relnofollowCubemapped Spherea pop up the most, but I was wondering which of the two is faster to generate. My question is particularly aimed at LOD, since I hope to have gameplay similar to No Mans Sky.p  pThanks in advance.p
