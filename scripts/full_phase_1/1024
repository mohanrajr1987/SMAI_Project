Positive 1024 pSo I know that the singleton pattern is implemented like thisp  precodepublic class ClassName      private static ClassName instance      public static ClassName getInstance          if instance  null              instance  new ClassName                  return instance           private ClassName   codepre  pWhat I want to ask is why you couldnt just do it like thisp  precodepublic class ClassName      public static final ClassName instance  new ClassName     private ClassName   codepre  pWay fewer lines of code and seems to do exactly the same thing. Minus the lazy initialization of course, but I dont see why lazy initialization would be a significant benefit anyway. Im not very experienced and would appreciate if you would enlighten me with your knowledge, thanks.p

Positive 1024 pContinuing with the answer given a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma167457535323367herea, is there a way to allow MyChildSingleton to be abstract, and then let its subclasses define their own constructors An example of what I would like to dop  precodepublic abstract class SingletonBaseltTgt      where T  SingletonBaseltTgt, new      private static T instance  new LazyltTgt gt new T     public static T Instance              get                                      return instance                    public abstract class DefaultConfigData SingletonBaseltDefaultConfigDatagt       This class wont compile since its abstract, and SingletonBaseltTgt      has a new restriction on T      Also, this class is immutable and doesnt change state     public virtual string SomeData  get   My Default Data String      public virtual double MoreData  get   2.71      public virtual double SomeFunctiondouble num          return num  2MoreData      public DefaultConfigData    nothing to do here         Another 50 or so default valuesfunctions...      enough to be tedious to redefine in multiple places,      and adding a constructor that takes every value would be ridiculous.      It would be possible to encapsulate this data, but Im not      yet sure how this should be done, so I havent gone there yet   public class SpecificConfigData1 DefaultConfigData      public override string SomeData  get   A Different String     public SpecificConfigData1    nothing to do here     public class SpecificConfigData2 DefaultConfigData      public override double MoreData  get   3.14     public SpecificConfigData2    nothing to do here      Downstream developers may need to define additional ConfigData classes  public class Library      public static double doSomethingDefaultConfigData data  return data.MoreData  2.0    public class Program      private readonly DefaultConfigData data     public Programbool choice              data  choice  SpecificConfigData1.Instance  SpecificConfigData2.Instance           public static void Main              Program prog  new Programruntime user input here         Console.PrintLineLibrary.doSomethingprog.data       codepre  pUsing a singleton pattern seemed like a good idea, because for each specific subclass the data only needs to exist in one place, and since its immutable this avoids most of the issues associated with singletons global mutable state, etc.. Providing the singleton functionality in an abstract base class would avoid the boilerplate of putting the private instance and public get property, which is what Im doing now in each subclass. This really isnt too onerous a requirement, Im sure I could live with it.p  pI dont want to make DefaultConfigData and its data static, because then I cant inherit from it and have my library functions know how to interact with it no support for metaclasses in C. Also, I dont want to use an interface, because so much of the functionality is shared, and I couldnt define that in the interface.p  pI would also welcome comments on alternative approaches, if the one Im trying to do cant be accomplished, or if another way is simply easier. I know that a factory pattern could also work here, and thats something I intend to try eventually.p  pLast, why is this even an issue Why wasnt the decision made to let abstract classes satisfy the new requirement, provided that any of their subclasses also satisfy a newp  pNote that my users are other internal developersmy future self.

Positive 1024 pThis is the scenario I have an angular app that allows the users to open details about a product on a modal window. The modal has corresponding url with it productid. A requirement of the app is that the users should be able to open multiple modals of this state on top of each other  for the different products they are viewing. Ex product1, product2...

So now I understand why all modals contents change to the latest modal content, but I dont understand why all previously opened ProductController rerun again.

Afterwards it makes some calls to getters inside of codeDataHandlercodep  precodeWebServiceportName  portName,     serviceName  MyService,     endpointInterface  com.myco.MyPortType,     wsdlLocation  WEBINFwsdlMyWSDL.wsdl,     targetNamespace  targetNamespace public class MyServiceImpl implements MyPortType   EJB private DataHandler dataHandler  Override public ResponseType doStuffRequestType request       code      ....     dataHandler.parseFiles      ....      more code     MapltString, CustomTypegt map  dataHandler.getCustomTypeMap     MapltString, CustomType2gt map2  dataHandler.getCustomType2Map  codepre  pNow I also have messagedriven bean that receives some data on a topic called UpdateTopic, then converts it into another type and stores it inside of codeDataHandlercodep  precodeMessageDrivenactivationConfig       ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  acknowledgeMode, propertyValue  Autoacknowledge,     ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  destinationType, propertyValue  javax.jms.Topic,     ActivationConfigPropertypropertyName  destination, propertyValue  UpdateTopic  public class UpdateTopicMDB implements MessageListener   EJB DataHandler dataHandler  Override public void onMessageMessage message      try          if message instanceof ObjectMessage              ObjectMessage objMessage  ObjectMessage message             Serializable data  objMessage.getObject             if data instanceof UpdateType                  dataHandler.convertAndStoreUpdateType data                            catchException e           log Exception       codepre  pI wanted to synchronize the codeparseFilescode method, the codeconvertAndStorecode method, and the two getters so that all data would be uptodate when accessed.p  pI simply made all four methods codesynchronizedcode to achieve this. My understanding is that if the files were in the middle of being parsed and an update comes into the MDB, then the codeconvertAndStorecode method would be locked until codeparseFilescode is done. Likewise, if an update is being converted and stored and the web service is trying to access one of the two maps, it will wait until codeconvertAndStorecode is finished. Correct me if Im wrong on any of that.p  hr  h2My Questionh2  pWith all of that being said, I just recently read about the codeConcurrencyManagementcode and codeLockcode annotations. Instead of synchronizing these four methods. It now seems as though I should just annotate codeparseFilescode and codeconvertAndStorecode with codeLockLockType.WRITEcode since they are modifying the beans state and the two getters with codeLockLockType.READcode.p  pShould I do this and avoid using the codesynchronizedcode keyword altogether Would there be any use for codesynchronizedcode maybe just for synchronized blocks, or do these annotations replace it nowp
Positive 1024 pIn my iOS app, many ViewControllers will need to sendreceive data from a server based on user input and actions.  I am going to use NSURLSession for all my networking activities.  But I dont want to make every ViewController conform to the NSURLSession delegate  protocol and repeat all the methods.p  pI see two solutionsp  ul lipCreate a class that conforms to the NSURLSession delegate protocol.  Other classes create an instance of this class and use its methods to sendreceive data from the server.  The reuse of the class handling all the networking will be done using singleton design pattern by overloading its init method so that only instance of it is created.p  ul liDisadvantage of this approach seems to be that having singletons make its tough to create unit tests that completely gets functionality of each class isolated form others. I.e.Suppose an error only happens because viewcontroler1 asked shared class to send a particular message followed viewcontroller 2 asked it send some other message.  Then it is not possible to catch this using unit tests.  li ulli lipSubclass of the UIViewController that implements the methods and subclass my ViewControllers of of this.  p  ul liOne issue here is that if I have different kinds of views in app, then I need to create subclass for each type of ViewController with NSURL session delegate methods.  And I have to carefully assign the delegate object from method to method.  When I look at it, I think this approach also has the same unittesting problem as approach 1.li ulli ul  pI would appreciate any comments on 1. Approaches others have used in similar situation 2. Proscons of above approaches including the 2 I have listed above.  I realize this may be a bit subjective, but IMHO getting good advice on design patterns is as important as or even more important than answers to what is wrong with my code or which API to use to solve problem Xp

Im using a codeSingletoncode only 1 instance exists in the whole application to deal with events and manage the game, at activitys codeonDestroycode the codeSingletoncode expects that the game has ended, and it must remove the references to the activity.

Positive 1024 h2Backgroundh2  pFirst of all, I think this question goes beyond the C standard. The standard deals with multiple translation units instantiation units and thus multiple object modules, but does not seem to acknowledge the possibility of having multiple independently compiled and linked binary modules i.e., code.socode files on Linux and code.dllcode files on Windows. After all, the latter more of less enters into the world of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiApplicationbinaryinterface relnofollowapplication binary interface ABIa that the standard leaves to implementations to consider at present.p  pWhen only a single binary module is involved, the following code snippet illustrates an elegant and portable standardcompliant solution to make singletons.p  precodeinline Tamp get    static T var   return var  codepre  pThere are two things to note about this solution. First, the codeinlinecode specifier makes the function a candidate to be included in multiple translation units, which is very convenient. Note that, the standard guarantees there is only a single instance of codegetcode and the local static variable codevarcode in the final binary module see a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcpplanguageinline relnofollowherea.p  pThe second thing to note is that since C11, initialization of static local variables is properly synchronized see the strongStatic local variablesstrong section a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcpplanguagestorageduration relnofollowherea. So, concurrent invocations of codegetcode is fine.p  pNow, I try to extend this solution to the case when multiple binary modules are involved. I find the following variant works with VC on Windows.p  precode dllexport is used in building the library module, and  dllimport is used in using the library in an application module.  Usually controlled by a macro switch. declspecdllexportdllimport inline Tamp get    static T var   return var  codepre  pstrongNote for nonWindows usersstrong codedeclspecdllexportcode specifies that an entity i.e., a function, a class or an object is implemented defined in this module and is to be referenced by other modules. codedeclspecdllimportcode, on the other hand, specifies that an entity is not implemented in this module and is to be found in some other module.p  pSince VC supports exporting and importing template instantiations see a hrefhttpssupport.microsoft.comenuskb168958 relnofollowherea, the above solution can even be templated. For examplep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt inline Tamp get    static T var   return var    EXTERN is defined to be empty in building the library module, and   to extern in using the library module in an application module.  Again, this is usually controlled by a macro switch. EXTERN template declspecdllexportdllimport intamp getltintgt codepre  pAs a side note, the codeinlinecode specifier is not mandatory here. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32879038identityoffunctiontemplateinstantiationinmultipletranslationunitsthisa S.O. question.p  h2The Questionh2  pSince there is no codedeclspecdllexportimportcode equivalents in GCC and clang, is there a way to make a variant of the above solution that works on these two compilersp  pAlso, in Boost.Log, I noticed the codeBOOSTLOGINLINEGLOBALLOGGERDEFAULTcode macro see the strongGlobal logger objectsstrong section a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1590libslogdochtmllogtutorialsources.html relnofollowherea. It is claimed to create singletons emeven if the application consists of multiple modulesem. If someone knows about the inner workings of this macro, explanations are welcome here.p  pFinally, if you know about any better solutions for making singletons, feel free to post it as an answer.p
Positive 1024 pTo exercise my OOP abilities on Scalaspecific features, I have tried to design a game where I have a codePlayercode class. It has an abstract method codeplaycode which decides, given a list of players different from the player the method is called on, what action to take. I wanted to prevent the codeplaycode method to alter the state of this other players. The right way to play is to cast a codeSpellcode and let the system reflect its effect on other players. p  pYet, the codeplaycode method needs read access to the other players to decide a strategy. I have thus created an inner singleton codeReadOnlyPlayercode. I made it a singleton to prevent copying over and over and simply returning this singleton everytime.p  precodeabstract class Playerprivate var health Int  0      Check.isPositivehealth      def health  health      def playplayers List[]  how to denote inner type ReadOnlyPlayer       def hitdamage Int   health  max0, health  damage this       def safeCopy  ReadOnlyPlayer      final object ReadOnlyPlayer extends Player          override def health  health           noop         override def hit damage Int    this         override def playplayers List[]         codepre  pI cant get it to compile because of the line I put a comment on. I am aware of a number of workarounds to this issue p  ul lipif it was a class instead of a singleton, I could use codePlayerReadOnlyPlayercode. I tried, it works fine. However, this requires to create a new copy everytime, so if I wanted to do this it would actually be better to create a separate immutable class. pli lipI could manually implement a singleton pattern and always return the same instance of this class. pli lipI could make the class private and only declare codePlayercode, but I want my clients to know they explicitly know they wont be able to modify the codePlayercode instance. I can do this using an sealed empty trait with a meaningful name.pli ul  pI know how I can handle this in various ways, so my question is more out of curiosity  stronghow can one denote an inner singleton type strongp

Positive 1024 pWhen the Gang of four introduced the singleton pattern, they also had to explain, why not to use static class fields and method instead. The reason was the possibility to inherit. For Java it had sense  we cannot normally inherit the class fields and methods.p  pLater the Effective Java book appeared. And we know now that the existence of reflection destroys the singularity of the singleton class with private constructor. And the only way to make a real SINGLEton is to make it as a single item of an enumeration. Nice. I had done some myself this way.p  pBut a question remains While we cannot inherit from enumeration, what is the use of this singleton Why we dont use these old good staticclass fields and methods p  pEdit. Thanks to the bayou.io I see that in a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.coma20418144104httpprogrammers.stackexchange.coma20418144104a there is a code that can trick the enum, too, and create again two exemplars of the enum singleton. The other problems are mentioned there, too. So, there is no need to use enum instead of the usual singleton class pattern, too BTW, all enum pluses that are mentioned here till now, work for singleton classes, too. p

Negative 1024 pI have two projects, both of which use CMake. Now I want to include one of the projects as a library inside the other, while still maintaining the ability to compile them as standalone projects.p  pWhat I have done so far is Use the version control system to clone a copy of the child project in a subdir of the parent project. Ive used the addsubdirectory to include the CMakeLists.txt of the child project into the parent project. And I have fixed name collisions between targets by renaming some of the targets in the child project.p  pHowever, an issue that I am running into is that the various configuration tests in the child project dont seem to be running. For example, the child project uses the FindThreads module to determine what synchronization primitives are available. The parent project is unaware of threading issues and therefore does not have any tests related to this. Similarly, the child project has various tests for headers and such that are not needed by the parent project. None of these tests appear to be running, and the symbols defined by these tests arent being added to the CMakeCache.txt file.p  pI really dont want to have to hoist all of the child projects tests which mostly deal with platformspecific issues that are not relevant to the parent into the parent projects CMakeLists.txt.p

Negative 1024 pI have what I hope is a simple question pertaining to the Atmel AVR microcontrollers. So I want to use the ATTiny85s Analog Comparator to determine if a signal is above or below a threshold.

Hope this question isnt too hardwareoriented for stackoverflow. Thanksp  pstrongEDITstrong In response to some of the comments below to the effect of why not treat it digitially, its because my signal is generated by a sensor namely an optical IR sensor. I cant be assured that it will pull down hard enough to be interpretted as a zero digitally, so Im going to use the internal 2.56V reference as my switching threshold. Im just trying to pick up the IR event, so this seemed the simplest way to me.p  pAlso, by using the analog comparator, I can detect the event asynchronously using an ISR. Granted some of the pins can invoke an interrupt on a digital edge, but the one dont want to rely on the response to dip below VIL.p

Negative 1024 pDoes anyone have any suggestions for doing this  At the moment, a new row gets added to the database and I call requery.

Id like these to animate somehow so the user can see them immediately.p  pI was thinking of perhaps having a hashmap or some data structure in my Adapter that holds the id of a particular row and a boolean stating whether or not it has been viewed.  In bindView, the boolean for the id of that row is checked and, if true, animates some flashing of some sort, and then updates the data structure.  Does this sound plausiblep  pAlso, when the Cursor is requeried, Id like to scroll the list to where the new row is.  Unfortunately, I dont think I can know its position without brute forcing through the list until I find it.  Any suggestionsp

I also tried ddd, but it was a little frustrating to use since it would not display some complex structures with arrays.

Negative 1024 pI realize there are a ton of questions regarding this issue, but the solution of setting every view in the row.xml to focusablefalse and focusableInTouchModefalse do not work, nor does getting the ListView from the ListActivity and setting setItemsCanFocusfalse.p  pWeirdly, when registered for a context menu, the long tap works. The regular tap though Nope. I tried setting listeners like OnItemClickListener to no avail.p  pI read somewhere that I might be able to remedy this by overriding getView in my Adapter Im not too sure how that works though. Note, I dont want to know what view the user has clicked I just care about the list row being clicked to initiate the corresponding code in onListItemClick.p  pMaybe theres something in my row.xml thats all wrong Or is it affected by the way I set my ListViews adapter placed in onResume instead of onCreate to update informationp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout   xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid   androidlayoutwidthfillparent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidorientationvertical   androidfocusablefalse   androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltTextView styleandroidattrlistSeparatorTextViewStyle   androidididlistSectionHeader   androidlayoutwidth  fillparent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidpaddingTop2dp   androidpaddingBottom2dp   androidpaddingLeft5dp   androidtextColorandroidcolorwhite   androidvisibilitygone   androidfocusablefalse   androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltRelativeLayout   androidorientationhorizontal   androidlayoutwidthfillparent   androidlayoutheight70dp   androidbackgrounddrawablelistbutton   androidfocusablefalse   androidfocusableInTouchModefalse   androidclickabletrue   androidlongClickabletrue   gt ltTextView androidididitemID     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidvisibilitygone     androidtextStylebold     androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidfocusablefalse     androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltCheckBox      androidididreturnedCheckbox     androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue     androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue     androidlayoutmargin10dp     androidcheckedfalse     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidfocusablefalse     androidfocusableInTouchModefalse     gt ltLinearLayout     androidlayouttoRightOfidreturnedCheckbox     androidlayoutmargin5dp     androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidth180dp     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidfocusablefalse     androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt     ltTextView          androidididstuffName         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlines1         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidellipsizeend         androidscrollHorizontallytrue         androidtextHey there         androidtextSize25sp         androidtextColorFFF         androidshadowColor000         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalse     gt     ltRelativeLayout         androidididdetailsLayout         androidorientationhorizontal         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt         ltTextView              androidididdueListItem             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlines1             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidtextSize14sp             androidtextstringdueListing             androidfocusablefalse             androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt         ltTextView             androidididdueDate             androidlayouttoRightOfiddueListItem             androidlayoutmarginLeft2dp             androidlayoutwidth90dp             androidlines1             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidtextSize14sp             androidtextHEHEHE             androidfocusablefalse             androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt         ltImageView             androidididstarMark             androidlayoutalignRightiddetailsLayout             androidlayouttoRightOfiddueDate             androidlayoutmarginLeft10dp             androidlayoutmarginTop2dp             androidlayoutheight15dp             androidlayoutwidth15dp             androidscaleTypefitXY             androidadjustViewBoundstrue             androidsrcdrawableliststarred             androidvisibilityinvisible             androidfocusablefalse             androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt     ltRelativeLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt ltImageView          androidididcontactPic         androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue         androidlayoutheight48dp         androidlayoutwidth48dp         androidbackgroundFFF         androidlayoutmargin10dp         androidlayoutcenterVerticaltrue         androidscaleTypefitCenter         androidpadding3dp         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalse     gt ltImageView          androidididlentArrow         androidvisibilityinvisible         androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidsrcdrawableindicatorlent         androidlayoutmarginTop42dp         androidlayoutmarginRight1dp         androidfocusablefalse         androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt ltRelativeLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 1024 pCurrently all my objects contain save and load methods. These methods are basically creating an xml document. Inner objects are serialized using their respective save methods sometimes its interfaces. Now I want sometimes to do different serialization in some of my objects. So basically I want to be able to go from one version of serialization to another.p  pOne way is to seperate the serialization logic from the class itself into a separate class kind of like microsofts xmlserializer and thus extending functionality, but then I have a problem when an objects type is unknown to me because its a base class or interface.p  pIs there another, better way other than using XmlSerializer or DataContractSerializerp  pThanks, Pavelp

Negative 1024 pI have been the sole developer for a complex application that has grown to the point where I need to begin to build a team of developers. Our system is a 250,000 LOC PHP app with MySQL as the backend DB.p  pI have a staging server which perfectly replicates the production web servers and compute nodes. In the past, I have been committingpushing to staging, run tests, and then push to production when I have debugged everything. This has been very useful and there havent been any issues because I have been extremely careful about testing MySQL alters, inserts, deletes, etc as the staging server hits production DB servers.p  pBeing the sole developer, I havent gone down the path of replicating the MySQL servers into a staging or dev clone. This is because our app deals with several thousand tables sharded across 4 production DB servers using a consistent hashing algorithm for table lookup. I havent figured out how I can clone and keep in sync these DB servers each one is 8 cores with 64GB of RAM. Our total DB size is 300GB. Keeping this much data in sync seems to be nearly impossible with a small dev enviornment. Not to mention that if I did keep them in sync the devstaging environment would be so slow that it might be close to unusable. p  pIve thought about building tons of test data and just keep the schemas in sync, but I would like for devs to see production data to code and debug against. Given the nature of our application, it is important that a developer sees the same data that populates the production DB servers.p  pMy question is what should I do for a dev environment in this scenario I want to give devs the freedom to play around with schema as they code complicated parts of the system, but I dont want them playing with live schemasdata. I should also note, that I keep hourly and daily backups of all the DB servers both onsite and offsite. I can rollback MySQL tables, but it will be painful and might require some downtime. Im thinking the best option is to avoid this need in the first place.p  pWhat has anyone else done successfully I doubt that places like Facebook and Google replicate their entire DB setup to developer machines so there has to be some sort of setupprocess that I am just not aware of.p  pThanks for taking the time to read this lengthy post and I look forward to any advice you may have.p

Negative 1024 pI am trying to edit some existing JavaScript validation code.p  pUsing the codeonkeydowncode event, the code checks that the value in a textbox does not go past a maximum length. I cannot use codeltinput maxlengthvalue gtcode as there may be some formatting characters in the string that I can safely exclude from the maximum length.p  pThe code works fine apart from when the user has pressed the insert key to turn overtype on and they have reached the maximum length. When this occurs if they place the cursor before a character and try to overwrite it the validation thinks that this will go over the limit and doesnt realise that a character will actually be replaced.p  pThis a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1137172determinetheovertypemodeusingjavascript11372081137208answera states that I cannot detect if overtype is on, but doesnt provide any references. So assuming that I cannot detect overtype, is there anyway in the codeonkeydowncode event to detect if a character is going to be replaced. p  pI am happy with an IE only solution.p  pstrongUpdatestrong codeonblurcode is not appropriate as this will let them go many characters over the limit before warning them of the maximum length. I would like to prevent them from going over the limit.p

Negative 1024 pI am relatively new to programming so this may well sound like a stupid question to you seasoned pros out there. Here goes p  pIn C, when I use the delete operator on arrays, I have noticed that the data contained in the released memory locations is preserved. For examplep  precodeint testArraynew int[5] testArray[3]24 coutltlttestArray[3] prints 24 delete [] testArray coutltlttestArray[3]  still prints 24 codepre  pSubsequently, am I right in assuming that since codetestArray[3]code still prints 42 , the data in the deleted memory location is still preserved If so, does this notion hold true for other languages, and is there any particular reason for thisp  pShouldnt freed memory locations have null data, or is free memory just a synonym for memory that can be used by other applications, irrespective of whether the locations contain data or notp  pIve noticed this is not the case when it comes to non array types such as int, double etc. Dereferencing and outputting the deleted variable prints 0 rather than the data. I also have a sneaking suspicion that I might be using wrong syntax to delete codetestArraycode, which will probably make this question all the more stupid. Id love to hear your thoughts nonetheless.p

Negative 1024 pI am working on a project whose focus is the use of term rewriting to solvesimplify fixedsize bitvector arithmetic problems, which is something useful to do as a prior step to some decision procedure such as those based on bitblasting. The term rewriting may solve the problem at all, or otherwise produce a much simpler equivalent problem, so the combination of both can result in a considerable speedup.p  pI am aware that many SMT solvers implement this strategy e.g. Boolector, Beaver, AltErgo or Z3, but it is being hard to find paperstechreportsetc in which these rewriting steps are described in detail. In general, I only found papers in which the authors describe such simplification steps in a few paragraphs. I would like to find some document explaining in detail the use of term rewriting providing examples of rules, discussing the convenience of AC rewriting andor other equational axioms, use of rewriting strategies, etc.p  pFor now, I just have found the technical report a hrefhttphci.stanford.educstrreports200706.pdf relnofollowA Decision Procedure for FixedWidth BitVectorsa which describes normalizationsimplification steps performed by CVC Lite, and I would like to find more technical reports like this one I have also found a poster about a hrefhttpwww.stanford.edusonalmMittalCURISPoster.pdf relnofollowTerm rewriting in STPa but it is just a brief summary.p  pI have already visited the websites of those SMT solvers and I have searched in their emPublicationsem pages... p  pI would appreciate any reference, or any explanation of how term rewriting is being used in current versions of wellknown SMT solvers.

For instance, Z3 3. introduced a new bitvector decision procedure but, unfortunately, I was not able to find any paper describing it.p

Negative 1024 pFor class Im working on my first GUI application. Its just a simple image viewer with four buttons Previous, Next, Stop, Play. Previous and Next work fine, but honestly I dont even know how to begin working on the slideshow part Play amp Stop.

Negative 1024 pI am new to python. I need a data structure to store counts of some objects. For example, I want to store the most visited webpages. Lets say. I have 100 the most visited webpages.

If no dateString is passed, just close the datepicker without                         changing the field value.                          Also, if the page developer has defined a function called datePickerClosed anywhere on                         the page or in an imported library, we will attempt to run that function with the updated                         field as a parameter. This can be used for such things as date validation, setting default                         values for related fields, etc. For example, you might have a function like this to validate

Negative 1024 pI am having this strange issue with the tomcat 5.5 and tomcat 6.0 servers.

In tomcat 7.0 the application is running fine even if the other application failed to initialize.p  pAfter some debugging i came to know there is one jar named crystal.jar which is in the webinflib folder of both applications. I have moved the jar to commonlib folder of tomcat then it started working fine. I want to know why it is working fine in tomcat 7.0 not in tomcat 5.x and tomcat 6.x versions. Is there any change in classloading architecture between these versions p  pThanksp  pbEDIT1b The library was in the location of both the applications WEBINFlib directory and they have no dependency with the external DLLS. Just now i read about tomcat 5.5 classloader architecture and came to know that every web application have its own class loader. The libraries in WEBINFlib folder and classes folder will be loaded into this classloader. The libraries whichever stored under common directory will be placed into a shared classloader. Then this library should be loaded seperately in seperate class loader of web application. There by even if one web application fails to start other web application should work independently. Thats why i felt strange and need to investigate furthur.p

Negative 1024 pIm trying to understand if its a good idea to let an Object cancel a network operation in its dealloc method, when the Object is referenced in the operations completion block.  p  pIll try to explain with an examplep  pI have a codeUsercode object with property codepicturecode, codeUsercode has a code[self fetchPictureFromServer]code  p  precode voidfetchPictureFromServer      NSDictionary cmdParameters  ...  set parameters      block User weakSelf  self        [[AppClient sharedClient] sendCommandgetpicture parameterscmdParameters successAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, id response                   success           UIImage downloadedImage  ...  get image from response            weakSelf.picture  downloadedImage  set image to users picture property             failureAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, NSError error           failed      ] codepre  pThe codesendCommandcode method will create and enqueue to codeNSOperationQueuecode a codeNSOperationcode  that in time will initiate a codeNSURLConnectioncode to download the image. When the operation is successfully finish the success block will be called.    p  pIm  using codeweakSelfcode because I dont want the block to retain my User object and prevent it from being dealloc, I want that the user will be responsible to cancel an existing operation if exists when he gets dealloc.br So the User dealloc method look like this  p  precode voiddealloc          [[AppClient sharedClient] cancelAllCommandsForSenderself]      [super dealloc]  codepre  pBut it seems that although Im canceling the operation in the dealloc method, sometimes the success block is called strongafterstrong the user gets dealloc, and I get codeEXCBADACCESScode in line codeweakSelf.picture  downloadedImagecode.  p  pstrongWhy is it happening Could it be that the operation try to finish the connection even if it was canceledstrong  p  pI know that if Ill use just self and not weakSelf in the block, this will not happen because the block will retain the User. But I do not want this behavior, I want that the user will get dealloc immediately when its released, even if a fetching operation exists.  p  pemstrongUPDATEemstrong I noticed that the operation state isFinished  YES, it seems that with the library I use, when an operation is finished, it doesnt execute the success block immediately, but it dispatchasync the success block with the main queue.    p  pSo what properly happen isbr 1. user fetch image  an operation is createdbr 2. the operation finish  dispatchasync the success block still not executedbr 3. before the success block is executed the user dealloc  cancel all his operations but not the operation from step1, because it is in isFinished statebr 4. now the success block is executed  I get EXCBADACCESS when try to reference user.  p  pStill no idea how to solve this..p

Negative 1024 pHello ladies and gentlemen, we are in process of building conceptual model of webbased audio editor. And the first trouble we met is clientside caching system. In my opinion as serverside programmer having huge cache on client side is perfect idea, because in many cases it takes of server load by excepting multiple loading of the same data. Futhermore such cache could be good candidate for buffer for providing pertrack operations, like filtering. p  pOur flex programmer sais that this is a great trouble and it is impossible in almost any cases. But I am in great doubt, cause I know that actual Google Chrome browser version can simple keep up to 2 Gb in localStorage. Moreover Ive found a hrefhttpadvanced.aviary.comtoolsaudioeditor relnofollowthis examplea of online trackeditor and looks like its caching mechanism working pretty good.p  pSo the question is Is it possible to cache some data smth about 100200mb on the client side using flash and jsp

Negative 1024 pI am writing a program that acts like a private web server that can be launched when a resource CD is autorun.  Once this server is started, it binds itself to an ephemeral TCP port and will then launch a browser to display the resource CD content.  My hope was for this web server to automatically shut down once the process that it launched for the web browser was dismissed by the user.  What I found, however, is that if the browser process was already running I tried this on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE, the process that the web server launched served merely to start a new tab in the browser and then shut down.  I managed to find a workaround for IE by invoking the executable with the noframemerging command line option but I have not been as successful for other browsers.  p  pDoes anyone know if Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera have command line options that will disable this framemerging behaviourp

Negative 1024 pI have recently started to work with Yii and have been quite impressed with it. However, i am facing a strange issue with regards to how Ajax URLs are created for CGridView. What i am trying is searching for the first time, then going some pages ahead in the search results by clicking on the pagination links and then searching again. However the second time my grid is sending request in the following formatp  precodehttp127.0.0.1myappbackendcustomersindexXDEBUGSESSIONSTART1Accounts5BaccountID5DAccounts5Bname5DAccounts5Baddress5Daddress1Accounts5Bbirthday5DAccounts5BclientType5DAccounts5Bemail5DAccounts5Bbalance5DAccounts5BhasAccess5DAccountspage3ajaxyw1ajaxyw1ampAccounts5BaccountID5DampAccounts5Bname5DampAccounts5Baddress5DampAccounts5Bbirthday5DampAccounts5BclientType5DampAccounts5Bemail5DampAccounts5Bbalance5DampAccounts5BhasAccess5DampAccountspage1 codepre  pyou can see half of this URL is Rewritten which is created by CPagination when rendering pagination links. However, Yiis gridview js appends the new query to pagination link ending up with duplication of variables in URL with both previous and new value. As a result of this, when the code execution reaches Line 411 in the CUrlManager.php which isp  precodeREQUEST[name]GET[name]value codepre  pthe value in GET variable are lost value contain old values of the url which are contained in the rewritten part of the URL SEO Friendly.

Negative 1024 pI got a weird problem with one of my Android app. I will explain myself p  ul lipI have a SplashScreen sort of which is an activity. Basically, it stays 1 second and after this time a handler is called. This handler launches my codeHomeActivitycode, which extends codeRoboActivitycode Roboguice API.pli lipDuring this launch, I see in my stack trace that Roboguice is initializing, and my class too. So it takes 12 seconds more to launch the codeHomeActivitycode after the 1 second wait of the SplashScreen.pli lipSo basically, this is here that I got a problem. During this 12 seconds of loading, the SplashScreen is the one showing in front, and the codeHomeActivitycode only appears after this 2 seconds. If the user clicks, during these seconds, on the screen, it will be the codeHomeActivitycode that will trigger the event. It means that if you click on the SplashScreen, and you wait, when the codeHomeActivitycode will show, you will hear a click sound and the button, located where the user clicked, will trigger.pli ul  pI find it very disturbing for the user. So, at the moment, I tried to p  ul lipDeactivate the buttons in the xml layout by adding p  precode            androidenabledfalse             androidclickablefalse codepreli lipReactivate the buttons by adding in the onResume function p  precodebutton.setEnabledtrue button.setClickabletrue codepreli lipI see in the stacktrace that the codeOnClickListenercode is triggered just after the codeonResumecode.

Negative 1024 pIve seen the Google library libphonenumber, and Im thinking of using it to format user entered phone numbers on an international website.  The end result needs to be consistent as the internal CRM is integrated with the phone system to pull up the correct user account details when a customer phones.  The phone system will always contain the international code for that user, even if the call originates from inside the same country as the office.p  pSo, I intend to provide a drop down with international dial codes, then leave the rest of the telephone field as free form, but limited to numerical digits, spaces, brackets and dashes.  The entry would then be cleansed by stripping out everything but the digits.p  pThe libphonenumber would do an initial sanity check to determine whether it appears to be a valid number, then convert it into the correct international format.p  pI presume separating area codes and subscriber numbers separately would be overkill, but my question is whether to store only the final fully international formatted entry, or to store the international code separately to the rest of the number e.g. 2 db fields.  Is there a legitimate technical reason for doing this, or is it purely a business decisionp

By probing the stackframe I could work out when the function has been called recursively and then trigger an exception to return to the decorator code.  However, I cant work out a way of gluing these ideas together to make anything that actually works.p  pAlternatively, I could try accessing the abstract syntax tree for the function and try transforming calls to recursive functions to yield statements, but this seems like its heading in the wrong direction.p  pAny suggestionsp  pEDITp  pIt certainly looks like I am misusing Python, but another approach I have been considering is to use a different thread for each block of, say, 500 stack frames and then insert queues between each consecutive pair of threads  one queue for arguments, and another queue for return values.  Each queue will have at most one entry in it.  I think this probably doesnt work for some reason  but Ill probably only work out why after Ive tried to implement it.p

Negative 1024 pI am using PostSharps [CompositionAspect] capability to dynamically inject an interface to a model object in my WPF application. However, it seems WPF cannot bind display properties corre   ctly unless the relevant interface is explicitly implemented on the model object p  pUsing a custom CompositionAspect ComposeObjectAspect I am able to successfully expose the internal IMyInterface objects properties directly by runtime casting the ModelObject to the introduced interfacep  precode some interface definition, for sample completeness public interface IMyInterface       public string MyProperty  get set      model object, which does NOT implement IMyInterface directly, though the interface is dynamically introduced by PostSharp [ComposeObjectAspecttypeofIMyInterface] public class ModelObject       private IMyInterface actualDataObject   . . .  public class ViewModel      public ObservableCollectionltIMyInterfacegt MyData  get       public void LoadData               concrete IMyInterface dtos are returned here, and put into a VM collection         IListltIMyInterfacegt myData               from IMyInterface o in SomeDataSource.LoadLocalDescriptors               select new ModelObjecto as IMyInterface.ToList         this.MyData  new ObservableCollectionltIMyInterfacegtmyData       codepre  pThis all works fine, and if I inspect any object in the myData list, or cast it to the type IMyInterface which as you can see form the strongclass ModelObjectstrong definition above is not implemented directly, I can see the inner properties from strongactualDataObjectstrong directly.

Negative 1024 pI am using the rather nice javascript library Recline a hrefhttpokfnlabs.orgrecline relnofollowhttpokfnlabs.orgreclinea it is build around Backbone. It also uses SlickGrid. p  pThere are quite a number of examples and of course there is the source code to have a look at too. I have got quite a long way on my own  writing my own backend and showing the data in a slickgrid view. p  pHowever one thing I cannot find in the examples is how to append a record to a dataset. I would like to bind the action to a button, so I can append an empty record on the end of the dataset, so I can then use the slickgrid view to edit the data. p  pThe only way I seem to be able to add a record is to round trip to the server, but I dont want to have to do that, since that would involve having to post valid data since in reality I dont want blank rows in my dataset. I would like to have the possbility to add a few rows on the browser client before actually posting the data via REST to the server. p  pThe code looks like this at the moment.p  precodedocument.readyfunction  var dataset  new recline.Model.Dataset      url restmonitors,      backend restlet,           dataset.fetch.donefunctiondataset              var el  mygrid         var grid  new recline.View.SlickGrid           model dataset,           el el,           state                  gridOptions editable true,enableCellNavigation true,                 columnsEditor [                              column monitoruntil, editor Slick.Editors.Date ,                              column enabled, editor Slick.Editors.Checkbox ,                              column owneremail, editor Slick.Editors.Text,                              column normalinterval, editor Slick.Editors.Text                            ],                 columnsWidth[column owneremail, width 100,column url, width 300,column lastaccessed, width100 ]                                    grid.visible  true         grid.render           Bind Save Button to a function to save the dataset          savebutton.bindclick, function                alertthis.text               dataset.save                        codepre  p p  pWith this code I can only edit and save existing records which have been delivered with the restlet backend.p

Negative 1024 pI have a table view controller that implements UISearchBarDelegate and UISearchDisplayDelegate.  I have a button to toggle edit view for my table view.  When in edit mode, a user can select many rows and copy them, delete them, etc.   If I try to enter something in the search bar, while the table view is in edit mode, the shouldReloadTableForSearchString method fires, and there I refetch my data from core data with an updated predicate, and return YES from the function, indicating that the table view should be reloaded.  When the filtered results are presented, they are not in edit mode, even though in cellForRowAtIndexPath i can see that tableView isEditing is YES.  I can not see the circles for the multiple selection.

Negative 1024 pI have a standard WPF grid with 2 columns defined asp  precodeltGridgt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt         ltColumnDefinition Width MinWidth200 gt         ltColumnDefinition WidthAuto gt     ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt     ... ltGridgt codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is that the second column is automatically sized based on its content and the first column gets all remaining space. However I also want the first column to never have less than 200 pixels. The problem is that with this configuration my auto column will be cut off instead of being resized.p  pWhat I really want is WPF to first assign 200 pixels to the first columns, then take all remaining space and ask the content of the second column to size itself with a maximum size restriction of the remaining width. If the content needs less space, it should assign the remaining space to the first column making it bigger than the 200 pixel.p  pstrongUse casestrong My second column is an image with a fixed aspect ratio, so that for a given height there is an optimal width. I also have a first column with some controls that should always be visible. If there is more space available than needed I would like to assign the space to the first column instead of the second.p  pIs there a way to achieve this with default WPF controls or do I need to write my own Grid for thisp

Quitting amp relaunching correctly restores the radio buttons to the state you left them last, so its definitely correctly getting the selected tag, storing it in NSUser defaults, retrieving it from NSUserDefaults, and setting the selected cell by tag on the NSMatrix.p  h2Heres where it gets screwyh2  pTheres another button that, when clicked, does a bunch of other work and ultimately then sends the codegenerateUserPasswordcode message to itself to generate a password again, this is all in the main controller and running in the main thread. Whats the first thing that it does Calls code[[passwordRadioGroup selectedCell] tag]code. Fine, you can safely do that as much as you want, as illustrated above, rightp  pIf you select one of the radio buttons, therefore changing the selected cell via the GUI and sending the codeselectPasswordTypecode message to my main controller again, yes. You will encounter no issues although, I admit it seems a bit slow and PWODs for a second.p  pIf you emdo notem click on the NSMatrix after launch so not forcing the selectionaction again from the GUI, that code[[passwordRadioGroup selectedCell] tag]code call in codegenerateUserPasswordcode will immediately PWOD. If I hit the pause button in Xcodes debugger to see where its at, its always in codepsychmutexwaitcode called from codeclasslookupMethodAndLoadCachecode in the main thread. If codeselectPasswordTypecode werent called programmatically and able to run code[[passwordRadioGroup selectedCell] tag]code without issue, Id have at least some sanity left.p  h3Helph3  pTo reiterate, Ive followed this through in the debugger and can verify that the memory address amp ivars confirm that codepasswordRadioGroupcode is not being changed out from under me, nor is it being deallocated Ive tried with amp without Zombie Objects enabled. The only references to codepasswordRadioGroupcode in my main controller are those seen above. Googling for all sorts of NSMatrixradiocodeselectCellWithTagcodecodeselectedCellcodecodeselectedTagcodecodeclasslookupMethodAndLoadCachecodemutex termscombinations has not been fruitful.p  pAny solutions, troubleshooting suggestions, or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Id like to receive notifications from the Java side so it needs to call back into the C app. Ive found numerous examples on invoking Java functions from C this is the easy part and calling CC functions from Java that are exported from a DLL.p  pEverything Ive found so far is how to invoke Java callbacks from an external C function within a Java app. I need the opposite.p  pWith straight C this, is of course, easy. Id simply pass a function pointer to the class which would in turn call as a callback when needed. How can I do this when Im instead invoking a Java functionp  pIn case theres a better way altogether than what Im asking for here is the overall applicationp  pMy C application needs to access an external server which will stream data back to my app. The access API is a Java based API. My current plan is to build a Java wrapper that will handle all of the API calls. This wrapper will be invoked from my C app using JNI. When data is received, it will process it as much as possible and then notify my C app with the adjusted data.p  pTo sum up how can I call a C function callback from a Java class which was in turn invoked via JNI from a C application. There is no DLL to load for Java to use. Although I can make one if needed if everything can interface properly.p  pFunction Path C application  Java class library  C callback functionp

Negative 1024 pIve been reading a lot about floatingpoint determinism in .NET, i.e. ensuring that the same code with the same inputs will give the same results across different machines. Since .NET lacks options like Javas fpstrict and MSVCs fpstrict, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma6685966154766the consensus seems to bea that there is no way around this issue using pure managed code. The C game AI Wars has settled on using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma616015154766Fixedpoint matha instead, but this is a cumbersome solution.p  pThe main issue appears to be that the CLR allows intermediate results to live in FPU registers that have higher precision than the types native precision, leading to impredictably higher precision results. An a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combdavidnotarioarchive20050808449092.aspxMSDN article by CLR engineer David Notarioa explains the followingp  blockquote   pNote that with current spec, its still a language choice to give   predictability. strongThe language may insert conv.r4 or conv.r8   instructions after every FP operation to get a predictable behavior.strong   Obviously, this is really expensive, and different languages have   different compromises. C, for example, does nothing, if you want   narrowing, you will have to insert float and double casts by hand.p blockquote  pThis suggests that one may achieve floatingpoint determinism simply by inserting explicit casts for every expression and subexpression that evaluates to float. One might write a wrapper type around float to automate this task. This would be a simple and ideal solutionp  pOther comments however suggest that it isnt so simple. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8795656154766Eric Lippert recently stateda emphasis minep  blockquote   pin some version of the runtime, casting to float explicitly gives a   different result than not doing so. When you explicitly cast to float,   the C compiler stronggives a hint to the runtimestrong to say take this thing   out of extra high precision mode if you happen to be using this   optimization.p blockquote  pJust what is this hint to the runtime Does the C spec stipulate that an explicit cast to float causes the insertion of a conv.r4 in the IL Does the CLR spec stipulate that a conv.r4 instruction causes a value to be narrowed down to its native size Only if both of these are true can we rely on explicit casts to provide floating point predictability as explained by David Notario.p  pFinally, even if we can indeed coerce all intermediate results to the types native size, is this enough to guarantee reproducibility across machines, or are there other factors like FPUSSE runtime settingsp

I created bash script which returns customer usernamep  precodeoldestls tr1 tempdata.detailshead 1 head n1 oldest codepre  pThis finds odest file tempdataxxx.details and returns username, lets say xxx.p  pNow, to the phpp  precodeusername  shellexec.oldestorder.sh name  shellexechead 2 tempdata.username..details  sed n 2p codepre  pI can get username in my php, with the first line its xxx, but second line does not work, However, if I change .username. to xxx, it works, so problem is somewhere around this variable.p  pPlease advice.p
Negative 1024 pI run a forum which has a shoutbox plugin installed where users can talk to each other just like instant messaging. I decided to make what i thought would be a quick app which would just display the shoutbox so users could talk while on the go instead of using there browser. The problem i have found is that it all works great using android webview but when you try and send a shout it comes up with an error saying fail as though it has no communication with the actual shoutbox.p  pMy question is can webview be used like this or can it only be used to display a webpage with out actually interacting with it Below is my code what i am using so you guys can see if i am missing anything and if so please point me in the right direction thanks.p  precodepublic class splash extends Activity           WebView mWebView           Override         public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState                      final Activity mActivity  this             super.onCreatesavedInstanceState               Adds Progrss bar Support             this.getWindow.requestFeatureWindow.FEATUREPROGRESS             setContentViewR.layout.mainx                Makes Progress bar Visible             getWindow.setFeatureInt Window.FEATUREPROGRESS, Window.PROGRESSVISIBILITYON              mWebView  WebView findViewById R.id.webview             mWebView.getSettings.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue                  mWebView.loadUrlhttpwww.myforum.comforumsshoutbox.php               mWebView.setWebChromeClientnew WebChromeClient                               public void onProgressChangedWebView view, int progress                                        Make the bar disappear after URL is loaded, and changes string to Loading...                     mActivity .setTitleLoading...                     mActivity .setProgressprogress  100 Make the bar disappear after URL is loaded                       Return the app name after finish loading                     ifprogress  100                                             setTitleR.string.title                                                                   codepre

Negative 1024 pAs you can see in my output below, the label is displayed on top of my next piece grid. I know why this is happening because my grid bag constraints are at the same location but if I increase the y component of these constraints, my next piece grid is moved the the y coordinate after the larger grid. I would like to have the next piece grid where it is with the label right over top of it. p  pAny suggestionsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrzR0Y.png altenter image description herep
Negative 1024 pemstrongUPDATEDemstrongp  pResolved, with an xmlreader like thisp  precode id  rowid, repeatitems  false, root  responsegtclaimsgtclaimgtunits, row  unithasclaimIdcontains6002950hasunitIdcontains6003606  codepre  pAs it turns out, the solution was to move the dynamic filter to the xmlreader.row level and realize that an AND condition for the has filter chain means NO separators, as opposed to the comma, which means OR.p  pSo, for all of you out there who need to do something similar p  pstrongYESstrong, you can switch an xml, ajaxserverbound grid, to an xmlstring, local bound grid, by keeping the same xml schema for the data, the same column model for the grid, and just changing the xmlreader to apply filtering locally, equivalent to the filter normally sent to the server.p  pThe typical scenario for needing something like this is pointing the same UI to two different, data equivalent web services, but with different speed behavior. Fast web services can be called by an xml ajax bound grid, with server filters that limit the returned xml. Slow web services can be called outside of the grid which is later pointed to and xmlstring cached by the client. Data filters, in the later scenario, become client xmlreader dynamic filters applied to the xmlreader.row level.p  pemstrongINITIAL QUESTIONemstrongp  pMy scenario is thisp  ul liTwo jqgrids, one master, one detailli liInitially fed from fast web service ajax call, datatype xml, with xmlreader like this for the detail gridli ul  pcodeid  rowid,br repeatitems  false,br root  responsegtclaimsgtclaimgtunits,br row  unitcodep  ul liSwitch the same grids to disconnected mode, data type xmlstring basically, client stored xmlstring variable received from web service that takes too long to do multiple ajax callsli liWhen master grid row is clicked, I build dynamically a filter to filter down the detail gridli liBoth grids are fed now, in disconnected xmlstring mode, from copies of the client stored xmlstring javascript variableli ul  pFrom my prior experience with subgrids, I know you can filter the xmlstring grids by applying a selector to the xmlreader root section. So, I attempted first the following dynamic xmlreader complete xmlstring data sample at the bottomp  precodeid  rowid, repeatitems  false, root  responsegtclaimsgtclaimgtunitshasclaimIdcontains6002950,unitIdcontains6003434, row  unit codepre  pThis didnt work, both rows came back and shown in the detail grid.  At this point I looked back at my subgrid example, and saw that there I was going one level deeper with the filter. So I tried a deeper root filterp  precodeid  rowid, repeatitems  false, root  responsegtclaimsgtclaimgtunitsgtunithasclaimIdcontains6002950,unitIdcontains6003434, row  unit codepre  pThis didnt work, either. First, the has filter seems to not work even if I went deeper. Something must be wrong with this chained contains filter. Moreso, now the xmlreader row section didnt make sense anymore to be unit.p  pAt this point, I had spent too much time with the xmlreader selector, and I was thinking to try removing the xml nodes that dont match the filter and leave the xmlreader filterless. Tried a negative match filter on the selector I was trying in the root, by applying not to it.p

Negative 1024 pI have a set of data I am analyzing and I would like some help if you can. My data consist of two columns but my X column is only one point and my Y colunm is about 50 points . So when I plot it of course its just just diff points along the Y axis versus one single point on the x axis. Now those points are really closed to each other and what I would like to do is to label each point to their actual Channel name. But so far I tried to use the text function an it gives me an error saying that my x and y value should be the same. Im not sure which way to do this anymore. Keep in mind that I have the names of each data points in a file also. Can you help Keep in mind using one x value and 50 Y values. Lets say I fix it and now the names are on top of each other. Is there a way I am space them out without affecting the location of the points. Thanks for your help in advancep

Negative 1024 pI want to add a boundary to a specified parcel of land so that it stands out in the map with a colored outlineborder.

Its definitely an option if it supports parcels, but it looks to be very time consuming albeit free. p  pI also found a paid solution price not displayed called a hrefhttpwww.digmap.comproductsParcelBoundaries.htmlParcelStreama, but thinking its expensive and probably just using the above solution in the other SO post.

Negative 1024 pIve been looking around a lot of JavaScript answers but I havent found one that really answers my problem yet. What Im trying to do is load an image, grab the pixel data, perform an analysis, and then load another image to repeat the process.p  pMy problem is that I cant preload all of the images because this script has to be able to work on large amounts of images and preloading could be too resource heavy. So Im stuck trying to load a new image each time through a loop, but Im stuck with a race condition between the image loading and the script drawing it to the canvass context. At least Im pretty sure thats what is happening because the script will work fine with the images precached for example if I refresh after loading the page previously.p  pAs youll see there are several lines of code commented out because Im incredibly new to JavaScript and they werent working the way I thought they would, but I didnt want to forget about them if I needed the functionality later.p  pThis is the snippet of code that I believe is giving rise to the problemp  pEDIT So I got my function to work after following a suggestionp  precode function myFunctionimageURLarray    var canvas  document.getElementByIdimagecanvas   console.logCanvas Grabbed    if canvas  canvas.getContext      return       var context  canvas.getContext2d    if context  context.putImageData      return       window.loadedImageCount  0   loadImagescontext, canvas.width, canvas.height, imageURLarray, 0   function loadImagescontext, width, height, imageURLarray, currentIndex    if imageURLarray.length  0  imageURLarray.length  currentIndex      return false      if typeof currentIndex  undefined      currentIndex  0       var currentimage  new Image   currentimage.src  imageURLarray[currentIndex]    var tempindex  currentIndex   currentimage.onload  functione        Function code here      window.loadedImageCount      if loadedImageCount  imageURLarray.length          Function that happens after all images are loaded here           currentIndex   loadImagescontext, width, height, imageURLarray, currentIndex   return  codepre

Each library has several different configurations i.e. Windows 7 Release, Windows XP Release, MTMD runtime compilation flags for different platforms i.e. x86 and x64.

Without any automatic process to create a software distribution package, its necessary to build all the different configurations for each platform and then copy the created objects to a predefined folder structure and then zip the created folder giving it a release name and version. This process is quite time consuming and error prone.

Negative 1024 pI have a table with about 50,000 records in my Oracle database and there is a date column which shows the date that each record get inserted to the table, for example 04Aug13.p  pIs there any way that I can find out what time each record has been inserted For example 04Aug13 42000 PM.

Negative 1024 pI have an Oracle table in which I tried to insert a huge number of records about 150M. I was using sqldeveloper, and I did not click the commit button after my inserts.p  pNow the table is veeery slow on any operations, but if I do an update or a count, it shows the table has 0 records.  Example, an update on all records took 5 hours and it updates 0 records.p  pSo I figure that the reason why it is slow is because there are uncommitted transactions on it.  How do I commit any on these pending transactions  SqlDeveloper has been closed and opened after the initial inserts.p

Negative 1024 pTo create a better user experience, I would like to cache Images or other files like text files on the HD of the smartphone. Some functions I would implement p  ul liOptions to define size of cache if cache is too big, delete for example oldest files until its below 90 or so of the cache limitli liDelete files which have not been accessed for X daysli liCheck online if the files has been changed. Currently I was thinking to just retrieve the file size of the file online and compare it with the local file if you update a file, I think there is only a small change that the file size is exactly the sameli ul  pNow, I was wonderingp  ul liDoes there already exist a framework which can handle this I cant find anything with google. I do find some things for iOS like AFNetworking, but I prefer cross platform code I also dont know if AFNetworking is able to do something like thatli liI also find something like ASIDownloadCache in this case, they ask the server if the file has been modified since X. I see that I can do something similar in C with myHttpWebResponse.LastModified. Is this reliable for static filesli liHow to map URLs on local File Paths see belowli ul  pFor mapping URLs on local files in the cache, I was just thinking of defining a Cache folder somewhere and add the file in location Cache  URL the URL without the https part. Then checking if the file is already cached is very simple. I could also use a Dictionary and load it in memory, but then I need to serialize it and Im not sure if it will increase or decrease the performance when there are a lot of entries.p  pThanks, Matt p

I have a model like thisp  precodeApp.Event  DS.Model.extend     someAttributes     DS.attrstring,     rel        DS.hasManyrel,      important function           var rel  this.getrel         return rel.filterPropertyreactionType, important     .propertyrel,      whatever function           var rel  this.getrel         return rel.filterPropertyreactionType, whatever     .propertyrel  codepre  pAnd the JSON response from the server looks like thisp  precodeevents     [ someAttributes attr1, rels [1, 2, 4],      someAttributes attr2, rels [3]],  rels     [ id 1, reactionType whatever ,      id 2, reactionType important ,      id 3, reactionType important ,      id 4, reactionType whatever]   codepre  pSo first of all, is that JSON response correct Havent seen an official example yet And second of all how can I get a computed property like this to work It worked in emberdata 0.13. I also tried to move the computed property to the rel model, but that doesnt seem to have any effect. Anyway, hope that makes sense and appreciate any help.p

Negative 1024 pstrongEDITstrong Originally I intended to use AutoMapper to achieve my goal, but I had to learn that AutoMapper is not intended to work that way. It gives you the possibility to create profiles but in my case fully configurable I would need for each parameter combination one profile, so I came up with an own approach, see answers.p  pFrom the AutoMapper wiki I learned to create a simple mapping like p  precode    Mapper.CreateMapltCalendarEvent, CalendarEventFormgt.ForMemberdest gt dest.Title, opt gt opt.MapFromsrc gt src.Title     Mapper.CreateMapltCalendarEvent, CalendarEventFormgt.ForMemberdest gt dest.EventDate, opt gt opt.MapFromsrc gt src.EventDate.Date     Mapper.CreateMapltCalendarEvent, CalendarEventFormgt.ForMemberdest gt dest.EventHour, opt gt opt.MapFromsrc gt src.EventDate.Hour     Mapper.CreateMapltCalendarEvent, CalendarEventFormgt.ForMemberdest gt dest.EventMinute, opt gt opt.MapFromsrc gt src.EventDate.Minute codepre  pFor two classes likep  precodepublic class CalendarEvent      public DateTime EventDate     public string Title   public class CalendarEventForm      public DateTime EventDate  get set      public int EventHour  get set      public int EventMinute  get set      public string Title  get set   codepre  pI was now wondering if there is a possibility to define the mapping externally i.e. in an XML file likep  precodeltObjectMappinggt ltmappinggt     ltsrcgtTitleltsrcgt     ltdestgtTileltdestgt ltmappinggt ltmappinggt     ltsrcgtEventDate.Dateltsrcgt     ltdestgtEventDateltdestgt ltmappinggt ltmappinggt     ltsrcgtEventDate.Hourltsrcgt     ltdestgtEventHourltdestgt ltmappinggt ltmappinggt     ltsrcgtEventDate.Minuteltsrcgt     ltdestgtEventMinuteltdestgt ltmappinggt codepre  pp  pand by that influence the creation of the map XML isnt a reqirement, can be everything else too. For simplicity say types are no issue, so src and dest should be the same otherwise it is ok to fail. The idea behind this is to be very flexible in what should be mapped and where it should be mapped. I was thinking about reflection to get property values based on its name, but this seems to not work. Im also not sure if this makes sense at all or if Im missing something important, so help and ideas are appreciated.p

Everything works in it, except the whole pushing of the broadcast part.

Except when we went to read the message we then got an error that said the message was deleted.p  pWe didnt delete it, so I think maybe it hasnt been 6 hours yet the users phone will get the new broadcast in the future, but they got informed of the alert now. That alert isnt visible yet, so it throws an error. At least thats what I think it hasnt been 6 hours yet so I cant prove that.p  pMy problem is this strongHow do I tell Urban Airship I want an immediate post to go out, without having to add 6 hours to the current time to make it in the present, as well as actually having the phones get it at the correct timestrong p  pI contacted UA but they said to expect a week delay in responding to you No rush, eh and I googled the error code 40700 and came up with nothing. I then emailed the guy who built the original and all he said was the UTC was very important. Thank you for that.p  pIf anybody can help me out I would be very thankful.p  pThank you.p  pOh, and if anybody is wondering, the json Im submitting looks like the followingp  precodeschedulescheduledtime20131012 064600,pushaudienceall,notificationalertMessagernKenton IndustriesrnKenton Test,iossoundpolice.mp3,extraid406,badge1,androidextraid406,blackberrycontenttypetextplain,bodyid406,bodyKenton IndustriesrnKenton Test,typeMessage,devicetypes[ios,android,blackberry] codepre  pThanks p

In some cases i want the tool to just run the excel macro, then after x seconds exit excel and mail the file. This all works fine since i can just wait for fixed period of time. However, in some cases i want the to be able to check and change the data which has been retrieved by the excel macro. When this is the case i want to keep excel open until the used manually closes excel. When i detect excel is no longer opened i want to mail the file.p  pThis last case gives me some trouble. Because i use the excel interlop to open excel, i cannot i am not able to use the WaitForExit like i can with a normal process. When i manually close excel the process also keeps running in the process explorer. p  pI have searched for solutions on the internet but none of them really work. Is there any way i can achieve this in a simple wayp  pemstrongUPDATEemstrong Thanks a lot for your reply, It really helped me. Waiting for excel now works correcly.

Negative 1024 pHow do I convert this JavaScript code to Clojurep  pI am trying to draw a x,y world where the cells are on or off according to the fill property. In the example below I am trying to print the rows then columns but my next step is to move the fill property around up, down, left, right. So, I dont want an answer which wouldnt work if I were not printing the data structure.p  pMy goal is to understand how to think about this problem in a functional way. It was easy for me to solve this problem with mutable state in JavaScript. While working on the solution, I was able to easily reason about how to write the code in JavaScript but when I came to do the same in Clojure, I was at a loss. So, I feel like a good answer to this question would be to help me understand how to think about this kind of problem in a functional way.p  pI have watched many talks and read a bunch of articles about Clojure and functional programming but when it becomes to writing the code, its difficult for me to get started.p    pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodevar world  [     [ x 1, y 4, fill0 ,  x 2, y 4, fill0 ,  x 3, y 4, fill0 ,  x 4, y 4, fill0 ],     [ x 1, y 3, fill0 ,  x 2, y 3, fill0 ,  x 3, y 3, fill0 ,  x 4, y 3, fill0 ],     [ x 1, y 2, fill0 ,  x 2, y 2, fill0 ,  x 3, y 2, fill0 ,  x 4, y 2, fill0 ],     [ x 1, y 1, fill0 ,  x 2, y 1, fill0 ,  x 3, y 1, fill1 ,  x 4, y 1, fill0 ] ]  function printworldworld      var out       forvar row0 rowltworld.length row          forvar col0 colltworld[row].length col              out  [world[row][col].fill]                  out  n          console.logout   printworldworld codepre  pThe output looks likep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode[0][0][0][0] [0][0][0][0] [0][0][0][0] [0][0][1][0] codepre  pEDIT After spending time working through the problems at 4clojure.com, I realized that I was trying to bite off a larger problem ex. a Chess game in Clojure than I was ready to solve.

Negative 1024 pI thought scaling an application in FireMonkey should be easy as it is supposed to work an a RetinaMac too.

It also requires to have a rootTLayout present in all forms for which the scale factor can be set. I dont have such a element in my forms and Im afraid to add one as I cannot be sure if I run in another firemonkey bug than.p  pSo how do I account for different DPISettings using FireMonkeyp  pEdit I tried hacking TPlatFormWin and set CurrentScreenScale to 2 but it didnt work I got black toolbars, but no scaling, but at least it used the HighRes alternative from the provided TImage.MultiResBitmap.p

Negative 1024 pFirst things first, Im brand new here and Im hoping that this adheres to your guidelines for questions. I dont believe other questionsthreads here would be applicable at least they didnt appear to be. p  pAnyways, Im a programming novice taking a C class in college. The assignment Im working on has to do with the Split method. Im supposed to ask the user for names and bowling scores in a textbox, split it into a temporary array, then take the appropriate index values from the temporary Array and place them in Name and Score arrays. It should handle up to 10 players, but it should work for fewer than that partially filled array. p  pIt will calculate and output the high score  who has it, the low score  who has it, and the average score, as well as outputting all the names and scores. I want to reject any entered scores that arent between 0 and 300 before they enter the array, but when I enter a value outside of that range and debug, it says that the greater thanless than equal to is true. Obviously, if I enter 9001 or 3 etc. as a score Id want it to be rejected. Here is that part of the code.p  precode        public void GetSplitstring stg                   string[] tempArray          Split the temp array         tempArray  stg.Split              Professor said a for loop would be unnecessary since its a GUI               LOW  300              ifscore[index] lt LOW ampamp score[index] gt 0             this part here is returning true when it should be false                  1st score is in the 2nd slot in tempArray                 if input is not between 0300 and is NOT an integer, yell at them                 if int.TryParsetempArray[1], out score[index]                                       MessageBox.ShowYELLINT                     return                                   bool status  int.TryParsetempArray[1], out score[index]  true false                 1st name is in 1st slot in tempArray                 name[index]  tempArray[0]                          codepre  pIf anyone has a solution as to how or why this isnt working, as well as an example on how to get it to work even a redirect to another answered question thats similar to the one Im asking that I missed, thatd awesome.

Negative 1024 pIm surprised that i havent found much online concerning the display of ellipsis in a CEdit control in MFC.  We have a control that can show only about 20 characters but the max length of the string that goes into the control is 32 characters.  I am interested in showing a middle or end ellipsis if the string length goes beyond the visible length.  Has anyone tried this  Something that concerns me is whether the string pulled out of that control using GetWindowText will return the actual string or the string with the displayed ellipsisp

Negative 1024 pIm programming state machine and wonder if there is an perfect solution.p  pRight now Ive created an FSM class, which functionality, I believe, you can easily guess from the very declarationp  precodepublic class FSMltEntity, States, Commandsgt   codepre  pStates and Commands are supposed to be enums, Entity is a type which would utilize FSM functionality. FSM will need Entity instance to pass it as a parameter in a transition handler methods. Im pretty happy with the result, but what I still dont like is you have to declare States and Commands enums somewhere and also have to keep in mind where you have declared them. For examplep  precodeclass TheEntity      public FSM fsm     public enum TheStates  ...          public enum TheCommands  ...           public TheEntity              this.fsm  new FSMltTheEntity, TheStates, TheCommandsgt ...        codepre  pWhat I really would like is to 1 Get rid of States and Commands type parameters, instead of them declare corresponding enum stubs right inside FSM class 2 Make user have to extend FSM class instead of just initializing its instance.p  pFor example, what is an FSM class should bep  precodepublic abstract class FSMltEntitygt      public EnumStub States     public EnumStub Commands     ...  codepre  pHow you should use itp  precodepublic class MyFSM  FSMltTheEntitygt      public enum States  ...      public enum Commands  ...      ...   public class TheEntity      public MyFSM fsm      public TheEntity          fsm  new MyFSM ...        codepre  pSo that, at first, you initializing it just by new FSM..., second, all its states and commands are already inside FSM not somewhere else, third, you should be warned and obliged to declare your own States and Commands, while, fourth, FSM methods youve inherited in MyFSM class still must be able to work with your own States and Commands. p  pAny possibilities to do that or the same As Ive found already, I cant declare field that are meant to be overridden, so it looks like the main obstacle for now.p

Negative 1024 pI am having a problem but I am not sure where.p  pI have created a website which uses Angular, this might not be pertinent but then again it might be. Of the many features of this site one of them is the ability to upload a file and then get back a response. The response is a simple amount of JSON. The only browser I have to get this working with at this point in time in IE8. emavoiding incoming thrown objectsem  I have tried everything to change this fact, but it is what it is.p  pI have gotten the site to mimic AJAX uploads by submitting a form and having the response redirected to an iframe. In fact I am using a module that does most of this for me. So far all this works better than you would believe in IE8. I know right Unbelievablep  pBut theres always a butp  pI need to get this page working when running in a Webbrowser control in a winforms project. I get as far as uploading the file which happens successfully. My REST service gets it, saves it, and returns the correct response. When debugging I can even see that the response is available. But for some reason the load method for the iframe is never called. The iframe which I have made visible on the page is never populated with the JSON.p  pAgain this works when running in IE but not when in the webbrowser control. I get no errors and have breakpoints and debugger statements everywhere. Its like the response falls in a crack and is ignored.p  pWould anyone have any suggestions as to why this is happening emcrossing fingersemp

Negative 1024 pIm writing a simple REST client for a C WinForm application. I use a hrefhttprestsharp.org relnofollowRestSharpa to make sending requests and getting responses easier. I have a few questions regarding how I should design my client.p  pThe user interacts with the client only once. He pushes a codeButtoncode and the client is instantiated and passed to codeprivatecode methods to do some logic in the background. It accesses objects from the server and synchronizes them with objects in the users internal database.p  pThe point is that the clients methods are accessed by codeprivatecode methods called following the users single action in the GUI. He does not have any control over which of the clients methods are called, and in which order.p  pSo my questions arep  ul lipCan I ask the server for a token only once when I instantiate my client, and then store it in the client instance for future reference in the clients following requests The token is a hash of the username and password, so it should not change over time. Of course, once I create a new instance of the client, it will again ask the server for a token.pli lipIs it okay to keep a single codeRequestcode object instance in my client I can then set request header only once and all the methods that access the API will only need to change the requests resource URL and HTTP method. It would reduce repetitiveness in my code. pli ul  pFor examplep  precodepublic PriceListItem[] GetPriceListItems     string requestUrl  Resources.PriceListItemsUrl     var request  new RestRequestrequestUrl, Method.GET    request.AddHeaderSecureToken, token     var response  Client.Executerequest as RestResponse     JObject jObject  JObject.Parseresponse.Content    var priceListItems  jObject[Data].ToObjectltPriceListItem[]gt     return priceListItems  codepre  pI have quite a few methods for utilizing different resource URLs, but all have the same header. If I keep only one codeRequestcode instance in my client I can set the header only once. Is this approach okay I would like to avoid any delegates and events.p

The codeCONVERTcode above was able to successfully convert every single column with no errors.p  precodeselect CONVERTdecimal 16,4, Value codepre  pNext I tried wrapping the select in another select and moving the comparison to an outer query.  That didnt work either and also resulted in a lot of memory usage so I scrapped that idea.p  pOne of my coworkers thought maybe there was one row of data that was causing an issue and even though the codeCONVERTcode on the select worked fine it was worth trying just to see.  We tried a codeREPLACEcode inside the codeCONVERTcode, as belowp  precodeISNUMERICValue  e0  1 and CONVERTdecimal 16,4,REPLACEValue, blah,  lt CONVERTdecimal 16,4, 11 codepre  p...and somehow this worked. No matter what we type in the replace it works just fine. It clearly isnt replacing anything. I read that codeREPLACEcode will truncate very large data 8,000 bytes but this is a codevarchar255code and so there isnt any large data in there to truncate.p  pIm mostly curious as to why this works or if there is something else likely going on here and the codeREPLACEcode coincidentally worked It doesnt make any sense to me.p  pEdit Just to be clear, I am stuck with this database design. I cannot change it. I realize this is a terrible way to store data. Trust me.p  pEdit 2 I just found out that codeTRYCONVERTcode will also work. My original question still stands I think.

Negative 1024 pI have a Node  Ember application. I ran into an issue around routes. Both Node and Ember handle routes and I have some routes that I would like Node to handle but some, I want Ember to handle. For instance, when the page loads, Nodes router kicks in so any route I declare in Ember is useless.p  pAssume that I have a route called settings in Ember JS. When I navigate to a hrefhttpmyapp.comsettings relnofollowhttpmyapp.comsettingsa by using the linkto helper from another view in Ember, I can see the page. However, once I am on that page and hit reload, I get a 404 because Nodes router is called and that route is not declared in Node. How do I resolve thisp

Negative 1024 pI am trying to simulate some clicking strongon a flash control on a window belonging to another executablestrong using the AutoIT COM Object.p  pSince it is a longrunning script Id like to keep the system usable by normal read physical means meanwhile. I first taught of a virtual machine, then I remembered that WndProc hooking exists.p  pNow Id like to simulate clicks with fake WM messages instead of using AutoIt because it hijacks the mouse, in order to be able to run the automation in background without the mouse moving by itself and my current active window i.e. notepad losing focus.p  pMy problem is that I have no idea on how to achieve the WndProc hooking in Vb.Net. People says a Dll injection is needed but in my previous Realbasic experience I did it in plain win api. To write messages I dont know, but to read worked.p  pemPs. Ive checked and no similar question seems to address this at least in vb.net.emp

Negative 1024 pI am designing a crossplatform messaging service as a learning exercise.  I have programmed socketbased servers before, but always a clientpollsserver design, like a web server.  I want to be able to target mobile platforms, and I read that polling is a battery drain, so I would like to do push notification.p  pThe server will be TCPbased, written in C.  What Im having trouble getting my head around is how to manage the bidirectional nature of the design.  I need a client to be able to send packets to the server as normal, but also listen for packets.  How do I mitigate situations like,  the client is sending data when the server is trying to send to it, or its blocked listening for data but then needs to send somethingp  pFor example, consider the following crude diagramp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5dLCB.png altcrude diagramp  pSo, lets say client A is in the middle of sending a chunk of data arrow 1.  While this is happening, client B sends a message arrow 2, which causes the server to attempt to send data back to client A arrow 3, but client A hasnt finished sending arrow 1 yet.  What happens in this instance  Should I setup 2 separate ports on each client, one for inbound, one for outbound  Do I need to keep track of the state of each connectionp  pOr is there a better approach to this altogetherp

I need to convert all of them to floating point numbers or rounded integers. The resulting text is an SVG that will be sent to the client and those numbers are part of a path. Can I do it with something built in or should I roll my own functionp  pThe problems with format are that it is a thin wrapper around the java Formatter class. This means that big ints are not handled since clojure has its own implementation.p  pOn the other hand clformat which should be the primary choice actually formats everything well except for rationals  45 is converted to 45.0.

Negative 1024 pPreface Im running a WordPress site in Elastic Beanstalk seated behind a Load Balancer in addition to a memcached node handling caching. Static files are split images are served out of a CDN while JSCSS is still being served out of the EC2s.p  pThe issue Ive been seeing lately is that the EB app has been seeing network in that is beyond a reasonable amount for the traffic thats actually hitting the site. Through GA I can see 200 people on the site but close to 2GB network inminute while at the same time delivering 250mb network outminute. Usually what occurs is Ill see a spike from close to 0 network in up to 2GB in the course of a couple of minutes which will stay sustained for a few hours. Along with the high bandwidth in usually comes high CPU usage which then cripples the site despite auto scaling rules bringing up additional instances. This is odd in that Ive seen this setup and codebase handle 10,000 concurrent users with the RDS being the weakest link it has since been upgraded to a larger instance size but here it is struggling with 200.p  pIm hesitant to believe that its a codebase issue as this started occurring after 23 weeks of no code deployments. However Ive gone through SQL general and slow logs to see what WordPress is doing and as far as I can tell the caching system is working. Get HitMiss ratio on the Elasticache node doesnt look out of the ordinary.p  pIm at a loss as to what would be the best way to go about figuring out where this bandwidth in is coming from. Apache and ELB access logs show what look like normal requests from a wide range of IPs, but I dont have enough expertise to know what a suspect request would look like.p

Negative 1024 pMy customers are developers of blogs and other websites. These websites are hosted on a wide variety of different sites, e.g. wordpress.org, dreamhost, etc.p  pI would like to be able to give them a bit of code eg some javascript andor php that causes a message to be sent to my tracker server whenever one of their pages is visited e.g. an httpgetrequest. The message must include a emsecret unique IDem, that uniquely identifies  confirms that the message is authentically from a visit to that customers website.p  pMy current strategy is to give the customers a snippet of jQuery to put at the top of their template to at the right time perform an httprequest to httprequest a codenotifytrackerserver.phpcode file that is also located on their server. The .php The secret unique ID would be inside that php file, so a visitor to the customers website would never see it.p  pIs this a good way to do thingsp  pMy concerns are p  ol liIn general, do wordpress.org and other popular hosting options allow .php files to be added to their sitesli liIn general, do they allow for httprequests to be made from their server to other serversli ol  pOr more broadly, is there a better way to do this For instance, is it possible to do so without using PHP or any other serverside script, but still keeping the unique ID secret.p

Negative 1024 pMy question is like Delphi compiler generates and assign numerical Identifiers to all the ResourceStrings when application is compiled, There are few documents which says when ever application is recompiled the numerical Identifiers for Resourcestrings are regenerated, and they warn relying on it because it may change after regenerations. There ate so many third party localization tools that use and store this resourcestring numerical identifiers for internal reference and translation. Is there any way to stop compiler regenerating this resourcestring numerical identifiers or force it to use manually generated numerical identifiers p

But my output looks like the following p  precodeObject arjrule3 Object   printing the json object read from file Object arjrule3 Object   locally changed value of accounts console.logsession.accounts  printing global value of accounts   value has not changed.  codepre  pWhat am i doing wrong Why isnt the value for accounts changing for the object session  p  pSomething Funny just happened, if i write the code as the following p  precodevar session  new Session var useraccountpath  adatauseraccounts.json loadJsonFileuseraccountpath    .thenfunctionres       session.setupAccountsres   Change Here     codepre  pOutput p  precodeObject arjrule3 Object Object arjrule3 Object session.accounts Object arjrule3 Object   works Why  codepre  pIt works, why is it so  p

Negative 1024 pI am trying to implement a FlipCard behavior in a ListView for my items and the bug is that my convertView dont update its visibility state according to the visibility I set in the getView method. Its like nobody cares of of my visibility changes.br To reproduce the problem click on an item picture sun, cloud..., it will flip the item and present its backside. Then scroll up or down until the convertView flipped is reused by a View that is not flipped. The not flipped view will not display its content anymore.br The first item should displays its content but it displays nothing because the convertView used the one gave by the getView parameter had

Negative 1024 pI have a class that can be created by passing a list of strings or by passing a file. The file will be parsed, creating a list of strings. So its actually a helper constructor.p  pParsing the file may take a long time however and the resulting list of strings may not be used ever even though the object is created anyways. Therefore I got the idea of lazy parsing the file so that the file is actually only parsed right before some methods of this objects are used.p  pIs there any way to do this in groovy or even a better way to achieve what I wantp

Negative 1024 pI want to fetch multiple messagesbroadcasts from a socket but I dont know how many there are and then continue with the program.  The messages are triggered by a broadcast in the network, so they should appear in a short time window.p  pI figured I want to loop over coderecvfromcode on the socket I set up earlier and want to use a timeout to know that I got them all.

Does it return 1 and sets an codeerrnocode If yes what would be the codeerrnocode So I can fetch it and continue.p  pOr is this better done in another wayp

Negative 1024 pI am trying to work out how to use dependency injection in Play Framework 2.4. I am familiar with general principles, but dont really understand the implications for design. My general reasoning has been, static methods in controller classes are too much like using global variables, and that can easily cause issues with thread safety etc., plus in general encourage bad design. So since Play now encourages switching to dependency injection, I should switch as well.p  pWhat I am confused about is what good practice is in this context. When I read Play official docs, it talks briefly about dependency injection and then promptly mentions a Singleton annotation. And and available example a hrefhttpwww.typesafe.comactivatortemplateplayguice relnofollowhttpwww.typesafe.comactivatortemplateplayguicea talks about a singleton WelcomeTextGenerator class as well.p  pSo I am wondering, should I be using singleton objects as the examples seem to imply If this is the case, what is the advantage compared to the old static methods approach Are there specific object types e.g., controllers that should be singletons, and are there performance implications to not marking objects as singletonsp

Negative 1024 pI am using Armadillo 5.200 with Visual Studio 2013 to solve a system of linear equations xAb.  My code calculates this by solving xAb, and I am using Armadillos solve function to solve the system of linear equations. p  pMy problem is that the solution returned to me is incorrect it is different from both the Eigen and Matlab solutions to the same problem, which match up.  The reason Im not just using Eigen in the first place is that it performs too slowly I have to make the calculation several million times and I want to see if using Armadillo speeds it up at all.  Im also just curious at this point why this error is occurring.p  pHere is a piece of sample code which illustrates the problemp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltiostreamgt include ltarmadillogt include ltEigenDensegt    Matrix operation to find world coordinates.   armamat mrdividearmamat A, armamat B     armamat At  A.t     armamat Bt  B.t       return solveAt, Bt.t   EigenMatrixXd mrdivideEigenMatrixXd A, EigenMatrixXd B     EigenMatrixXd At  A.transpose     EigenMatrixXd Bt  B.transpose         return At.colPivHouseholderQr.solveBt.transpose   int mainint argc, char argv[]       EigenMatrixltdouble, 4, 3gt  Meig     Meig ltlt 761.544, 0, 0,              0, 761.544, 0,              639.5, 399.5, 1.0,              3.762513283904080e06, 1.824431013104484e06, 9.837714402800992e03     armamat Marma     Marma ltlt Meig0, 0 ltlt Meig0, 1 ltlt Meig0, 2 ltlt armaendr         ltlt Meig1, 0 ltlt Meig1, 1 ltlt Meig1, 2 ltlt armaendr         ltlt Meig2, 0 ltlt Meig2, 1 ltlt Meig2, 2 ltlt armaendr         ltlt Meig3, 0 ltlt Meig3, 1 ltlt Meig3, 2 ltlt armaendr      EigenMatrixltdouble, 1, 3gt pixelCoordseig     pixelCoordseig ltlt 457, 520, 1     armamat pixelCoordsarma     pixelCoordsarma ltlt 457 ltlt 520 ltlt 1 ltlt armaendr      EigenMatrixltdouble, 1, 4gt worldCoordseig     armamat worldCoordsarma      worldCoordsarma  mrdivideMarma, pixelCoordsarma     worldCoordseig  mrdivideMeig, pixelCoordseig     stdcout ltlt world coords arma  ltlt worldCoordsarma ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt world coords eig  ltlt worldCoordseig ltlt stdendl      codepre  pMy output isp  precodeworld coords arma 5.3599e002  4.242e001  1.3120e001  8.8313e005 world coors eig .0978826  .439301  0   0.00010165 codepre  pThe eigen solution here is the correct one the one Matlab gives me, and makes logical sense with the calculation Im performing.

One div, is made a source while other two are made target. The HTML page has a button name toggle. p  pThe initial connection between source div and one of the target div is created with the help of drag and drop. When toggle is clicked, it will remove the connection between the source and the target, and will create the new connection between source and the other target.

Negative 1024 pI wrote the following very simple pthread code to test how it scales up. I am running the code on a machine with 8 logical processors and at no time do I create more than 8 threads to avoid context switching.  With increasing number of threads, each thread has to do lesser amount of work. Also, it is evident from the code that there are no shared Data structures between the threads which might be a bottleneck. But still, my performance degrades as I increase the number of threads. Can somebody tell me what am I doing wrong here. p  precodeinclude ltpthread.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include lttime.hgt  int NUMTHREADS  3 unsigned long int COUNTER  10000000000000 unsigned long int LOOPINDEX  void addNumvoid data      unsigned long int sum  0     forunsigned long int i  0 i lt LOOPINDEX i              sum  100          return NULL   int mainint argc, char argv      NUMTHREADS  atoiargv[1]     pthreadt threads  pthreadtmallocsizeofpthreadt  NUMTHREADS     int rc      clockt start, diff      LOOPINDEX  COUNTERNUMTHREADS             start  clock      for int t  0 t lt NUMTHREADS t          rc  pthreadcreatethreads  t, NULL, addNum, NULL         if rc               printfERROR return code from pthreadcreate is d, rc              exit1                    void status     for int t  0 t lt NUMTHREADS t              rc  pthreadjointhreads[t], ampstatus           diff  clock  start     int sec  diff  CLOCKSPERSEC     printfd,sec  codepre  pNote All the answers I found online said that the overhead of creating the threads is more than the work they are doing.

Negative 1024 pIm working on an exploit in a smartphones firmware update function. When rebooted into update mode, the phone will accept commands over USB and execute them as root but with SELinux restrictions. This is quite handy, but its a very limited shell, because the update program just passes the command to codeexecvpcode after forking, and doesnt hook up most of the file descriptors. So stderr is lost, anything interactive like an actual shell just hangs, etc.p  pIm looking for a way to leverage this backdoor to provide a proper shell. So far, heres what I knowp  ul liWhen you send a command over USB, the daemon forks, and the child then passes the command to codeexecvpcode. Im not sure the parsing exactly, but it looks like it just replaces each space in the command with a NULL byte to build the argument list. Redirection doesnt work any characters like codegtcode, codecode, codeampcode, codecode appear to be just passed directly as arguments.li liThe daemon runs as root, but SELinux prevents writing to most places, [re]mounting filesystems, etc. All writable areas are mounted as noexec, so its not possible to push a binary and execute it, as far as I can tell.li liThe processs stdout is sent back over USB, but its stderr and stdin are connected to devnull.li liThere is a binsh which is executable, but without stdin, its impossible to execute anything in it.li liHaving an actual shell probably wouldnt bypass any of these restrictions, but would be more convenient.li ul  pI suspect it might be possible to use some trickery with IFS or such to get binsh to spawn a shell connected to the proper file descriptors so that its actually usable, but Im not sure how to go about it.p
