Positive 2493 pMy apologies if this has been asked and Ive missed finding the answer, but I am trying to do a full text search of a CloudKit database where strongallstrong of the search words match. My example belowp  precodevar searchString  almond salad let predicate  NSPredicateformat self CONTAINS , searchString let query  CKQueryrecordType Recipe, predicate predicate codepre  pIll omit all of the other code to set default cloud database, execute query, etc. It all compiles correctly, but what I want it to do is give me any records that contain almond and contain salad in the same record  ideally I would get Almond Salad recipes. With it the way it is, it will give records such as almond cake and tomato salad where only one of the words match it will also give Almond Salad, but I want to get rid of the others. I guess Im reading the CKQuery documentation incorrectly, because it seems to say that all tokens should match in one record, but it doesnt seem to be doing so.

K. Rowling. The series chronicles the adventures of a young wizard, Harry Potter, the titular character, and his friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harrys quest to defeat the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who aims to become immortal, conquer the wizarding world, subjugate nonmagical people, and destroy all those who stand in his way, especially Harry Potter. Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, on 30 June 1997, the books have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide.[2] The series has also had some share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed. As of May 2015, the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making the series the bestselling book series in history, and have been translated into 73 languages.[3][4] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastestselling books in history, with the final installment selling roughly 11 million copies in the United States within the first 24 hours of its release. A series of many genres, including fantasy, coming of age and the British school story with elements of mystery, thriller, adventureand romance, it has many cultural meanings and references.[5] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[6] There are also many other themes in the series, such as prejudice and corruption.[7] codepre  phr Now bI want to find the Person in the database that is referenced in the documentbp  hr  pI have different ideas on how to do that.

I noticed a few times where this was not done and the amounts did not look correct.  i.e. 10.2 or 10.2546p  pA pro is the Float only takes up 8 bytes on disk where the Decimal would take up 9 bytes Decimal 12,2 p

Negative 2493 pI have just tried implementing a class where numerous lengthcount properties, etc. are codeuintcode instead of codeintcode. However, while doing so I noticed that its actually painful to do so, like as if no one actually wants to do that.p  pNearly everything that hands out an integral type returns an codeintcode, therefore requiring casts in several points. I wanted to construct a codeStringBuffercode with its buffer length defaulted to one of the fields in that class. Requires a cast too.p  pSo I wondered whether I should just revert to codeintcode here. Im certainly not using the entire range anyway.

I saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6301whyisarraylengthanintandnotanuintthis questiona and this at least explains why the framework itself always uses codeintcode but even in own code its actually cumbersome to stick to codeuintcode which makes me think it apparently isnt really wanted.p

Negative 2493 pI have a fair bit of experience working with the iPhone SDK. I have a couple fully developed apps including a utility application for tracking data and a board game. I would consider myself a novice on the iPhone SDK. I also have no issues with reviewing documentation and examples for hours until I understand something, as long as the documentation exists and makes sense. p  pI am not however an expert at XML documents and parsing attributes and creating documents. I have written in the past PHP code to access web services and complete transactions via SOAP XML messaging. I need to do a similar application using iPhone SDK. Here is what I need.p  p1 Create XML messages to send to a SOAP service 2 Receive XML messages from a SOAP service 3 Parse the XML response messages into a custom objectp  pAll of the URL and SOAP part is relatively straight forward. Where I start to get discouraged is the area of creating and parsing the XML messages. Using PHP these tasks are very simple as the language has built in SOAP clients and you can easily class map objects to SOAP messaging and the heavy lifting of the XML processing is just taken care of automatically. I have considered writing a proxy PHP service and simplifying what is needed on the iPhone side but this just complicates what I want and adds a dependency on another app to work in conjunction with the web service Im accessing.p  pIt seems that in the iPhone SDK or objectivec in general you have to be a pro at the construction and the parsing of XML messages on your own. I am really discouraged at the idea of creating tons of custom code to parse each message element by element. Ive taken a small look at TouchXML  KissXML and I am not thinking they are what I need.p  pThe real key objective here is that I want to easily receive an XML message and some how get the elements and their values copied over to an object. How can this be done without hours of writing parsing classes and understanding all of the guts of creating XML documentsp

Negative 2493 pIm using the C framework REBEX to download files from an FTP on Win7 64bit in VS2008.p  pAfter I press F5 to start debugging, I get an error that Access to the path Im downloading to is denied.p  pI believe this may be due to UAC and elevated permissions issues on Win7Vista.

Negative 2493 pIm working on a small program and I would like to save some control states and properties into a configuration file. However I dont want to use the traditional settings file due to several reasons, but rather have it serialized or simply saved into a specific file.p  pFor example get window1s TextBox1.Text and serialize it, so that when I start the app I can reuse the old value. Same would go for some Checkboxes for example.p  pHow can this be done  This is not a schoolwork project, since Im learning C from scratch in my spare time. Ive looked for several methods, but they are simply too complicated by either using a custom serialization class, specifically for that purpouse, or use settings the standard .settings file in Visual Studio. Also, Im working in C and the program uses WPF and not MFC.p
Negative 2493 pThis is something Ive never really understood about source control, specifically Subversion the only source control Ive ever used, which isnt saying much.  Im considering moving to git or Mercurial, so if that affects the answer to my question, please indicate as such.p  pOk.  As I understand it, every time I create a new file, I have to tell SVN about it, so that it knows to add it to the repository and place it under control.  Something likep  precodesvn add newfile codepre  pThats fine if Im the one creating the file I know I created it, I know its name, I know where it lives, so its easy to tell SVN about it.p  pBut now suppose Im using a framework of some kind, like Rails, Django, Symfony, etc., and suppose Ive already done the initial commit.  All of these frameworks create new files programmatically, often many at once, in different directories, etc. etc.  How do I tell the source control about these new files  Do I have to hunt each one of them down individually and add them  Is there an easier way  Or am I possibly misunderstanding something fundamental about source controlp

Negative 2493 pI am a lifelong objectoriented programmer.  My job is primarily java development, but I have experience in a number of languages.  Ruby gave me my first real taste of functional programming. I loved the features Ruby borrowed from the functional paradigm such as closures and continuations.  Eventually, I graduated to Scala.  This has been a great way to gradually learn to approach nontrivial problems in a functional manner.p  pNow I am interested in Clojure.  I know all the sexy features that make it enticing software transactional memory, macros, etc., but I just cant get used to thinking in lisp.  Ive seen Rich Hickeys screencasts aimed at java programmers, but they are geared towards explaining language features and not approaching real world problems.p  pI am looking for any advice or resources which have made this transition easier for others.p

Negative 2493 pI have some functions that are designed to handle 1256 bytes, running on an embedded C platform where passing a byte is much faster and more compact than passing an int one instruction versus three, what is the preferred way of coding itp  ol liAccept an int, earlyexit if zero, and otherwise copy the LSB of the count value to an unsigned char and use that in a do  whilecount loop a parameter value of 256 will get converted to 0, but will run 256 times liAccept an unsigned char, earlyexit if zero, and have a special version of the function for 256 bytes those cases will be known in advance. liAccept an unsigned char, and run 256 times if its zero. liHave a function like the above, but call it via wrappers functions that behave as 0255 and 256 only. liHave a function like the above, but call it via wrapper macros that behave as 0255 and 256 only. ol  pIt is expected that the inner loop of the function will probably represent 1530 of processor execution time when the system is busy it will sometimes be used for small numbers of bytes, and sometimes for large ones.  The memory chip used by the function has a pertransaction overhead, and I prefer to have my memoryaccess function do the starttransactiondostuffendtransaction sequence internally.p  pThe most efficient code would be to simply accept an unsigned char and regard a parameter value of 0 as a request to do 256 bytes, relying on the caller to avoid any accidental attempts to read 0 bytes.  That seems a bit dangerous, though.  Have others dealt with such issues on embedded systems  How were they handledp  pbEDITb The platform is a PIC18Fxx 128K code space 3.5K RAM, connecting to an SPI flash chip reading 256 bytes when fewer are expected would potentially overrun read buffers in the PIC.  Writing 256 bytes instead of 0 would corrupt data in the flash chip.  The PICs SPI port is limited to one byte every 12 instruction times if one doesnt check busy status it will be slower if one does.  A typical write transaction requires sending 4 bytes in addition to the data to be received a read requires an extra byte for SPI turnaround the fastest way to access the SPI port is to read the last byte just before sending the next one.p  pThe compiler is HiTech PICC18std.p  pIve generally liked the HiTechs PICC16 compilers HiTech seems to have diverted their energies away from the PICC18std product toward their PICC18pro line which has even slower compilation times, seems to require the use of 3byte const pointers rather than twobyte pointers, and has its own ideas about memory allocation.  Maybe I should look more at the PICC18pro, but when I tried compiling my project on an eval version of PICC18pro it didnt work and I didnt figure out exactly whyperhaps something about variable layout not agreeing with my asm routinesI just kept using PICC18std.p  pIncidentally, I just discovered that PICC18 particularly likes do  whilebytevar and particularly dislikes do  whileintvar I wonder whats going through the compilers mind when it generates the latterp  pre   do        localtest     lpw    whilelpw    2533                           newflashpic.c 792 do   2534                           newflashpic.c 793    2535  0144A8  2AD9                incf    fsr2l,f,c   2536                           newflashpic.c 795  whilelpw   2537  0144AA  0E00                movlw   low vartest   2538  0144AC  6EE9                movwf   fsr0l,c   2539  0144AE  0E01                movlw   high vartest   2540  0144B0  6EEA                movwf   fsr0h,c   2541  0144B2  06EE                decf    postinc0,f,c   2542  0144B4  0E00                movlw   0   2543  0144B6  5AED                subwfb  postdec0,f,c   2544  0144B8  50EE                movf    postinc0,w,c   2545  0144BA  10ED                iorwf   postdec0,w,c   2546  0144BC  E1F5                bnz l242 pre  pThe compiler loads a pointer to the variable, not even using the LFSR instruction which would take two words but a combination of MOVLWMOVWF taking four.  Then it uses this pointer to do the decrement and compare.  While Ill admit that dowhilewordvar cannot yield as nice code as dowhilewordvar the code is better than what the latter format actually generates.  Doing a separate decrement and whiletest e.g. while lpw,lpw yields sensible code, but it seems a bit ugly.  The postdecrement operator could yield the best code for a downcounting loopp  pre   decf lpw   btfss STATUS,0  Skip next inst if carry i.e. wasnt zero    decf lpw1   bc    loop   Carry will be clear only if lpw was zero pre  pbut it instead generates worse code than lpw.  The best code would be for an upcounting loopp  pre   infsnz  lpw    incfsz lpw1    bra loop pre  pbut the compiler doesnt generate that.p  pbEDIT 2b Another approach I might use allocate a global 16bit variable for the number of bytes, and write the functions so that the counter is always zeroed before exit.  Then if only an 8bit value is required, it would only be necessary to load 8 bits.  Id use macros for stuff so they could be tweaked for best efficiency.  On the PIC, using  on a variable which is known to be zero is never slower than using , and is sometimes faster.  For example, intvar  15 or intvar  0x300 would be two instructions each case only has to bother with one byte of the result and can ignore the other intvar  4 or any power of 2 is one instruction.  Obviously on some other processors, intvar  0x300 would be faster than intvar  0x300 if I use a macro it could be tweaked as appropriate.p

Negative 2493 pI have a simple php code which prints data from a SQLite database. Basically query Select A from B. This all works fine. amp when the sqlite db updates, i can refresh the page amp the new data displays.p  pWant i am aiming to achieve is to refresh this data automatically every 510 seconds without having to reload the entire page. I am also trying to avoid using iframes as there is about 20 of these on the page all displaying different data.p  pThis has been driving me mad the last few days, Does anyone know of a way to do so My thought have been javascript, jquery or AJAXp  pOther than that can you get sqlite data with javascript alone, without php amp then implement something like the below on the element only without the page reloadingp  setTimeoutlocation.reload,5000    pThank you in advance.p

Negative 2493 pIm using codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode with a codeUITableViewcode which displays a list of folders and associated unread counts for each item in that folder. Id like to insertdelete folders w animation from the tableView based on the unread count during a syncrefresh on a background thread utilizing codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode. Folders with no unread items should fade out, and existing folders with new unread items should fade in.p  pCurrently using the codecontrollerdidChangeObjectatIndexPathforChangeTypenewIndexPathcode method does not do this unless the tableView is completely reloaded, or the app is relaunched, which is not ideal.p  pIs codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode not the way to do this My initial idea was to create a separate Core Data entity that only holds the folders with unread items, and addremove folders from that, but that just seems hokey.p  pMy codeNSPredicatecode looks something likep  pcodeANY items.unread  1codep  pstrongUpdatestrong The above NSPredicate works fine and grabs the objects that I expect it to. My problem is that if the app launches and FolderX has 0 unread items, it does not appear. If I then refresh goes out and parses a JSON file in a background thread and FolderX now has 25 unread items, it will strongnotstrong automatically fade in or trigger codeNSFetchedResultsChangeInsertcode and since it wasnt included in the first place, it also doesnt trigger codeNSFetchedResultsChangeUpdatecode which is why I thought the solution was to create a separate Entity that only holds Folders with unread items and addremove from that during sync.p  pI just feel like Im missing something painfully obvious.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Ive simplified the problem as much as I can by removing the influence of my own app, Im able to replicate it in the default Core Data template in Xcode.p  pThe New Problem There is a single Entity named Event with no relationships and two properties, Date and unreadCount. I have NSFetchedResultsController set up with an NSPredicate that looks likep  precodeNSPredicate predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatunreadCount lt 10] codepre  pEvery time a new object is added, it is created with an unreadCount of 15, then all existing objects are decremented by 1. This is done on a separate ManagedObjectContext to replicate background processing, but is all done on the main thread.p  pIve implemented the controllerWillChangeContent and related methods, and what I expected to happen was that after an existing object with unreadCount of 15 is decremented 5 times to now be 10 it should be inserted into the tableView because it now matches the predicate. This is not at all what happens, the object does not appear at all unless the app is restarted.p  pIve attached a sample project, simply run it and click the Add button a few times nothing will happen. Restart the app and you will see a handful of objects now in the tableView, if you click the Add button a few more times those objects will remove themselves, but new objects will not get added.p  pIf NSFetchedResultsController is not the solution to get this behavior to work, then what isp  pSample Project a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu521075BGUpdating.zip relnofollowhttpdl.dropbox.comu521075BGUpdating.zipap

Negative 2493 pConceptually, it seems that a computation that performs output is very different from one that performs input only. The latter is, in one sense, much purer.p  pI, for one, would like to have a way to separate the input only parts of my programme from the ones that might actually write something out.p  pSo, why is there no input only Monadp  pAny reason why it wouldnt work to have an I monad and an O Monad, which could be combined into the IO Monadp  pstrongEditstrong I mostly meant input as reading files, not interacting with the user. This is also my use case, where I can assume that input files do not change during the execution of the programme otherwise, its fine to get undefined behaviour.p

Negative 2493 pOk, Ill do my best to explain the problem herep  pThe scenario is that were trying to keep track of currently on hand inventory for items that are continuously changing in quantity.p  pThe way its set up is that any time an item changes in quantity, a row is written to a MySQL table tracking that records the item SKU, the latest quantity, and a timestamp.p  pFor examplep  precodeDec. 4, 2010  Item 12  200  Dec. 5, 2010  Item 33  150 Dec. 8, 2010  Item 12  50 codepre  pThe problem is that we want to answer the question  how many total items do we have at any point in timep  pThis is harder than it looks because of the sparse data problem.p  pLets say on Dec. 4, 2010, we had 200 of item 12 Then on Dec. 8, 2010, we had 50 of that same item item 12 Meanwhile, on Dec. 5, 2010, we had 150 of item 33p  pOn Dec 4, 5, and 8, how many total items do we have The right answer is 200 total on Dec. 4, 350 on Dec. 5, and 200 on Dec. 8. How do we get those numbers Well, we have to carry forward the quantities of items from one date to the next. Even if we dont specify how much we have of that item on the next day, we have to assume that we had as much as we did the previous day.p  pSo, Dec. 4, we had 200 of Item 12, and so on Dec. 5, we still have 200 of Item 12, on top of which we now have 150 of Item 33. This yields 350 on Dec. 5. Then on Dec. 8, we still have 150 of Item 33, but just 50 of Item 12, yielding just 200 items.p  pThe query should return these results for the above datap  precodeDec. 4, 2010 200 items Dec. 5, 2010 350 items Dec. 8, 2010 200 items codepre  pThe tricky issue is that there might be thousands of items... this significantly complicates the MYSQL and PHP operation.p  pIm looking for an optimal solution here that makes the best use of MYSQL and PHP to solve this problem. Temp tables could work as could jamming data in a big PHP associative array, but I have a feeling theres a better way to do this.p

How could I set up the constructor in the DSLR class, to use the constructor from the main Camera class, and then set fields from the abstract DigitalCamera class Ive tried using the generate constructor option in eclipse, but it doesnt see the constructor from the main class, so I assume it cant be done that way.p  pAny help would be very much appreciated, thanksp

Ive been trying to implement a way of filtering those results dynamically via what the user enters in a related EditView.p  pFor testing purposes my code simply has a button at the top of the list, when i click the button it assigns a FilterQueryProvider and provides a hardcoded constraint string.

The albumSearch gives modifiedartistpickedcode, its good. The getRes gives the value of from the xml somethingarray, the setRes gives its actual id number which the getStringArray requires. The getRes2 gives the same as getRes its just there to check that it works fine. When I comment out the next two lines, the String albums[], and setListAdapter then the program works but it doesnt list the items.p  pThe xml filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltresourcesgt     ltstringarray nameartistsarraygt         ltitemgtcode1 exampleltitemgt         ltitemgtcode2 exampleltitemgt     ltstringarraygt     ltstringarray namecode1arraygt         ltitemgtitem1ltitemgt         ltitemgtitem2ltitemgt         ltitemgtitem3ltitemgt     ltstringarraygt     ltstringarray namecode2arraygt         ltitemgtitem1ltitemgt         ltitemgtitem2ltitemgt         ltitemgtitem3ltitemgt     ltstringarraygt     ltstring namecode1codegtcode1arrayltstringgt     ltstring namecode2codegtcode2arrayltstringgt ltresourcesgt codepre  pI hope I was able to write what I would like to do, and what is the problem p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pMarc Bernstein Because I dont know its code1array.

Negative 2493 pim in the early stages of developing an API for my site so that third party developers can build an iPhone application for it. The API would have a limited subset of the functionality of the full site. The trouble i have is around security and authentication for the user who downloads the application. I have come up with the following optionsp  ol liThe user enters the same credentials they use on the site to authenticate themselves. My API would then take the credentials when accessing information specific to the user. This is my least preferred solution as the third party application could log these details and use them maliciously on the full site.li liEach user generates a unique key on the site which they can then use on the app to login. My API would take the api key as an argument when accessing information specific to the user. The main problem though is that any application can do what they like to the user once they gain access to their key even if the user has not given the application permission to do so.li liTo overcome the above problem the third party developer would have to register their application with the site and then the user would need to generate a unique key per application they wish to use. This would then be used to login. This is my preferred solution as each key is unique per application and user i can tell which application called the api and whether the user approved it.li liMy final option is to implement oAuth. We are currently waiting for the 2.0 version to be finalized and do not have the time to keep updating our code as the spec may change.li ol  pThis is the first API i have had to build and i was wondering if i have understood this correctly Im assuming in option 1 the application could log the user credentials and use them maliciously but how does twitter overcome this issue with their third party applications Or is it simply up to the user to trust the application they are using If this is the case then would option 2 andor 3 be feasible in the meantime until i switch to option 4.p  pId appreciate your feedback.

Negative 2493 pI am doing some loading from an oracle db, using ODP.NET.p  pIn its current implementation the code does something along the lines ofp  precodequery entityIds to load based on criteria       foreach entityId         load attributes          query geometries that exist         foreach geometry that exists             load geometry         next     next codepre  pwhen the DB is on the local network criteria which load 133 entities takes a couple of seconds to load all 133 entities.p  pWhen the db is a remote db hosted on a VM in a data center on the other side of the world this takes about 3.5 mins to load them all.p  pThe particularly slow bit seems to be the querying the geometry.  In initial testing in TOAD  not in the service loading code it seems to take about 2 secs to load the geometry for a single entity using the remote machine.  If we change the query to load all the geometries in a single go, it still seems to take 2 secs.  This sort of implies that it isnt the network overhead as the amount of data being returned is much more for the query which returns all the geometries, but the time is the same.p  pIs this sort of performance overhead for a remote db vs local expected  Why does doing each query separately take so much longer than doing them all in one go  Is there anything we can do to mitigate this apart from do all the queries in one go  p

Negative 2493 pI was reading on session state, application state, cookies, profiles.. and i wondered way would i adapt to my site.p  pI am building a forum, and i need to check whether the user is logged in or not. If he is not logged in, he wont have the choices a logged user has e.g. pressing the replystart threadsubmit messages  buttons.

I looked at the modes of the session configuration that session state has got, and there was one that i liked.. it was modesqlServer, but then i read that it has a disadvantage of being slow, and that i need to install a few more components to make it work.. in other words it looks cumbersome.

Negative 2493 pIve seen a few questions and answers regarding to the endianness of structs, but they were about detecting the endianness of a system, or converting data between the two different endianness.p  pWhat I would like to now, however, if there is ema way to enforce specific endianness of a given structem. Are there some good compiler directives or other simple solutions besides rewriting the whole thing out of a lot of macros manipulating on bitfieldsp  pA general solution would be nice, but I would be happy with a specific gcc solution as well.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThank you for all the comments pointing out why its not a good idea to enforce endianness, but in my case thats exactly what I need.p  pA large amount of data is generated by a specific processor which will never ever change, its an embedded system with a custom hardware, and it has to be read by a program which I am working on running on an unknown processor. Bytewise evaluation of the data would be horribly troublesome because it consists of hundreds of different types of structs, which are huge, and deep most of them have many layers of other huge structs inside.p  pChanging the software for the embedded processor is out of the question. The source is available, this is why I intend to use the structs from that system instead of starting from scratch and evaluating all the data bytewise.p  pemThis is why I need to tell the compiler which endianness it should use, it doesnt matter how efficient or not will it be.em p  pIt does not have to be a strongrealstrong change in endianness. Even if its just an interface, and physically everything is handled in the processors own endianness, its perfectly acceptable to me.p

Negative 2493 pWhen I get coredumpcausing signal, I want to run my own handler to copy the siginfot and ucontextt structures to global variables, so that they may be accessed in the core dump. Currently at the end of my handler I reassign the default handler and call raisethesig. The problem with doing that is that the core dump info registers shows the state of the registers in my handler, and not at the time of the original signal. I realise that since Ive saved ucontextt, I can look in that for the original register values, but that knowledge is likely to get lostforgotten when core dumps are passed around the team.p  pSo my question is is there a way to reraise a signal, and ensure the core dump file holds the register state of the original signal I thought maybe I could use some inline asm to manually restore all the regs at the end of the handler, then return to the instruction that caused the signal instead of calling raise, but Im not sure if we can guarantee that reattempting the instruction will cause the same signalling behaviour as the first attempt.p

Negative 2493 pI made a mysql table with a column called uid that is a primary key but not an auto increment. This is because Im using a php rand00000000,99999999 or whatever to fill the uid with. It worked for a while until I tried to delete rows in the table. They wouldnt delete in phpmyadmin unless I checked them off and used the delete X at the bottom. The X on the same row as the record wouldnt do anything. So... when I finally had them deleted, I tried some more INSERTs from my php script, and now the uids are the same ones that they were before even though the random number being inserted in is different. So, I figured well i guess i dont need to make uid a primary key, so I removed that, and I just have a normal column called uid. But the problem persists. I tried to flush the mysql table. and I tried dropping the table and recreating it to no avail. Any ideas would be very helpful.

Negative 2493 pI have a routine to correctly allocate and deallocate my codeUIViewcode subclass, but when I set a break point in the classs code void dealloccode, I see that it is not called and I that have a huge memory leak.p  pSo I print the coderetainCountcode before the release and it is 2 this could be normal, because other objects can use it. I searched and do not see any other coderetaincode messages. Then I sendp  precode[myObject removeFromSuperview] codepre  pAnd now it is deallocated. Which makes me realize that earlier I sent  p  precode[self.view bringSubviewToFrontmyObject] codepre  pIt is VERY DIFFICULT know that when I use codebringSubviewToFrontcode, I always have to call coderemoveFromSuperviewcode. Do there exist other methods like this that can increase the retain countp  pIf this object werent a subclass, and was only a codeUIViewcode, I wouldve never known that I had created a memory leak.p  pSo, how can I really know that my objects have been released and that the memory is free p  pIt isnt important for me to know what is happening, but I want to know that I am creating and removing the object.

Negative 2493 pI am writing a simple 2d game similar to breakout or pong, where you move a bar along the bottom of the screen by tipping the phone left and right.p  pI am trying to use the Orientation sensor to achieve this movement however ive run into some issues.p  pAfter printing out the orientation sensors values for a while I decided rotation in the Z axis gave me what I wanted, If I hold the screen horizontal and perpendicular to the floor x 0, y 0, z 90 rotation in Z left and right takes away from 90. So the value 90z is fine for usage as an amount of steering value.p  pHowever this perpendicular to the floor position is not very natural to play with, people are much more likely to hold the phone at about 45 degrees in the Z axis, at which point all these values I have been using mess up completely, steering goes weird, people are unhappy..p  pI guess what I really need is to detect rotation in some zaxis even though the XY plane the phone is in is constantly changing. Is there some clever way to do this with Mathsp  pEDIT Just found the OrientationEventListener  Exactly what I neededp

Negative 2493 pI have a VB form that contains controls for interfacing with some hardware video cameras, motors, etc on the machine it is to be deployed on, but Im usually not at the location of said machine its a 3hour drive away.  Im trying to work on the project while on my laptop, but obviously the controls will generate all sorts of errors since they cant talk to the hardware.  p  pI was thinking of replacing the control types with my own mock control classes, then use if directives to control whether Im building for the real machine or my test machine.  Problem is, some of the affected code is in the form designergenerated code section the form designer automatically tries to correct my changes, so Id have to manually put them back all the time, and try to remember not to commit the form designers edits into version control.p  pAny suggestions on how I can get around this problem, or perhaps a different approach so I and my colleagues can work while away from the sitep  pIm working in VB2005.p

Negative 2493 pWeve been using Unity for our ASP.NET MVC3 applications.  The configuration is done solely in the web.config file.  See example below, where we are using singleton.  We are using constructor injection.  For 99 of our classes, we dont use singleton lifetime property.  We are looking at our performance and found out that multiple instances of the same class was being built multiple times for the same request.  We realized that instead of generating 3000 objects per request, we could knock it down to about 200 objects.  We may have a bigger design issue but that is for another day.

Negative 2493 pAs part of the management application were making, Im trying to optimize as much PHP and MySQL code I can, but I have a concern...p  pActually, our data scheme for storing a client order is the followingp  precodeyear gt DATE orderid gt INT11 orderlineid gt INT11 codepre  pWhat we basically do is to reset the orderid field each year legally, and for accountability purposes, you can either reset your ids or just let them grow, although account managers usually prefer the first option rather than the second one, and the same goes for order line ids, so each order has its line ids reset for each consecutive order.p  pAll of this, however, is done by hand. This is far from ideal and I would like to do it in the propersupTMsup way, which would be automating the process and handing reset control over to MySQL.p  pBut the question is... how How do I tell MySQL to automatically reset the AUTOINCREMENT field for strongorderlineidstrong with each new strongorderidstrong and to automatically reset the AUTOINCREMENT field for strongorderidstrong with each new strongyearstrongp

Negative 2493 pSo Ive been working on a problem in my spare time and Im stuck. Here is where Im at. I have a number 40. It represents players. Ive been given other numbers 39, 38, .... 10. These represent the scores of the first 30 players 1 30. The rest of the players 3140 have some unknown score. What I would like to do is  find how many combinations of the scores are consistent with the given data. p  pSo for a simpler example if you have 3 players. One has a score of 1. Then the number of possible combinations of the scores is 3 0,2 2,0 1,1, where a,b stands for the number of wins for player one and player two, respectively. A combination of 3,0 wouldnt work because no person can have 3 wins. Nor would 0,0 work because we need a total of 3 wins and wouldnt get it with 0,0.p  pIve found the total possible number of games. This is the total number of games played, which means it is the total number of wins. There are no ties. Finally, I have a variable for the max wins per player which is one less than the total number of players. No player can have more than that.p  pIve tried finding the number of unique combinations by spreading out N wins to each player and then subtracting combinations that dont fit the criteria. E.g., to figure out many ways to give 10 victories to 5 people with no more than 4 victories to each person, you would use  C14,4  C5,1C9,4  C5,2C4,4  381. C14,4 comes from the formula Cnk1, k1 google bars and strips, I believe. The next is picking off the the ones with the 5 not allowed, but adding in the ones we subtracted twice.p  pYeah, there has got to be an easier way. Lastly, the numbers get so big that Im not sure that my computer can adequately handle them. Were talking about C780, 39, which is 1.15495183  1066. Regardless, there should be a better way of doing this.p  pTo recap, you have 40 people. The scores of the first 30 people are 10  39. The last ten people have unknown scores. How many scores can you generate that are meet the criteria all the scores add up to total possible wins and each player gets no more 39 wins.p  pThoughts p
Negative 2493 pI have a Java program that is supplied a directory name, gets a list of all the file in that directory using codedirName.listFilescode and then iterates through every file parsing information from them.p  pThe files would normally all just be normal text files, but I am using SVN and there seems to be a directory called code.svncode in my codedirNamecode directory which is causing my program to fail because code.svncode is a directory and not a text file.p  pNow, I could implement filters using a codeFileFiltercode object, but I would really only expect text files to be in that directory in the final program. p  pMy question is Is there a way round my issue without using a FileFilter I also think that my program is ignoring the code.svncode directory in other programs that Ive written, so Im not sure why its an issue now.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2493 pWhen doing an orientation change in the emulator ADT v17.0.0, or on a device original Droid, I noticed that the activity will go through more than one createdestroy cycle sometimes. I found this a hrefhttpvikaskanani.wordpress.com20110106androidemulatorbugwhilechangingorientation relnofollowblog posta that mentions the problem, but offers no solution.p  pMy app API 8 currently does a lastchance save of user data in onPause, and retrieves that data in onCreateonStart, which works fine for a single restart, but gets into concurrency issues if the cycles come backtoback. Specifically if a load starts before a save is complete, the lastchance data is lost.p  pI did read the Faster Screen Orientation Change Androiddeveloper article which mentions transferring an Object via onRetainNonConfigurationInstancegetLastNonConfigurationInstance. I tried using onRetaingetLast... like a flag to tell if the activity is restarting, which works, but I still have the main issue of not knowing ifwhen any existing saveload operations are completed.p  pConcurrency amp threadmanagement are not my strongest suits, so Im looking for a solution that does emat least oneem save amp load across any number of backtoback restarts, without memory leaks.

Negative 2493 pWe have a webapp that were trying to use with android and have run into a zindex issue.  We are using asp.net with a lot of custom javascript.  Everything works great in chrome, firefox, ie7, 8, 9 and kindle but android does not seem to respect a particular zindex on a div that we create dynamically.p  pSo we have a modal dialog that has a grid control and when you select a grid item, it shows a menu with buttons.  These are all divs.  So the modal dialog div has a higher zindex than all other page divs and the menu div has the highest zindex.  On android, the menu div appears under the modal dialog div.    p  pIve tried numerous things to get this menu to show on top of the modal dialog such as asking for the zindex after the menu is displayed which is correct, the highest zindex of all absolute items, assigning a new higher zindex after it is displayed, moving the order of the divs around, etc and nothing seems to put it on top of the dialog as it does in all other browsers.p

Negative 2493 pIm losing my mind on this one.

For instance, if I call buildFacetsAge Group,2 I will get a value in that array of 2. However, if I call it again, it will just add another value of 2 to the array instead of removing the 2 that is already there because its comparing to the index, which is 0.p  pI hope Im explaining this right. Please let me know if it needs clarification.p

Negative 2493 pIm currently building a website ASP.net c and were looking at creating a live feed similar to the facebook one for data events on our website. I wanted to know your thoughts on how best to implement this as I am not sure my understanding is correct. p  pWe have events such as new article published, user coming online.p  pUsers will log in to their members area and should then see the live feed. p  pMy current thinking is that Id have a query every few seconds from the users browser which looks for any new events since the last request date. If there are new ones since dateX last request date then show that. p  pId save the last request date along with the userID so when they come back, I know what the last thing theyve seen is.p  pIs this the best way of doing it  or should I be looking at some sort of push methods I need it to be cross browser friendly and supporting older browsers... so the HTML 5 methods Ive looked at arent really an option.p  pThanks for any advice. p

Negative 2493 pMy understanding is that CloudFlare is a CDN that specializes in thwarting DDoS attacks for web apps that is basically creates a readonly cache of your entire app so that, if you are DDoSed, your users can still access portions of your app and not experience a total denial of service.p  pMy understanding of Dynamic DNS is that it is a technology that somehow allows you to immediately change the DNS settings of your web app URL without having to wait the standard 24 hours for DNS changes to ripple out over all the DNS servers in the world and take affect.p  pSo first off, if anything I have said so far is misguided or incorrect, please begin by correcting mep  pAssuming I am more or less correct, Im trying to protect my web app as best as I can against DDoS attacks.p  pFor one, I have decided to host my app with either Google App Engine or Heroku havent made the final decision yet, and I have to imagine that their IT staff is fully prepared to scale uphandle if my app is DDoSed while deployed to their servers.p  pUnfortunately for me, that means theyll emscale up and handleem the attack , which means my billing would soar through the roof and Id be out of business I guess thats called a cash attack.p  pSo I need a solution that handles both of the following scenariosp  ul liThe DDoS is enormous, and even GoogleHeroku say enough is enough, were not supporting this loadli liI specify a billing ceiling which both Google and Heroku provide, and after that ceiling is reached, I somehow redirect traffic to my CloudFlarereadonly web app hosted elsewhereli ul  pI suspect I will need to use Dynamic DNS somehow to handle the 2nd scenario, but without knowing how most web apps fortify themselves against DDoSes i.e. Ive hear of so called bastion hosts Im not even sure if Im heading down the right path or not.

Negative 2493 pDue bad early design I have many controls typeof codeMyControlcode which are filled with data by calling constructor functionality for filling is written in constructor not in separated method. Now I need to update data in these controls, but I dont wanna dispose current instance of control and then create it again only for filling with new data. Due many controls I also dont wanna add any abstract method FillWithData into MyControl and then implement it in each child control. My goal is to dynamically create method which will have the same body as Constructormaybe without InitializeComponents method  but it doesnt matter and also the same parameters  then I will add this new method into running instance of MyControl and fill this control with new data using this new method not with constructor. It would be best, if its possible to make something likep  precodeMyControlTextBox mct  new MyControlTextBox    MethodBuilder newMethod  new MethodBuildernewMethod newMethod.SetParametersconstructorParameters newMethod.CreateBodymct.getType.GetMethodBody  mct.AddMethodnewMethod codepre  pORp  precodemct.getType.GetMethodmethodWhichBodyIWannaChange  newMethod codepre  pand thenp  precodemct.getType.GetMethodnewMethod.InvokenewData... codepre  pis it possible to achieve something like this I can easily add any new virtual method or delegate into MyType and then if its possible change it with my new method and its more real to do it than adding new method into running instance.

Negative 2493 pIm writing a simple web application, using tomcat server, servlets and jsp pages. Ideally, I would like my website to be only one page into which I load content jsp files on user actions. p  pHowever it is also important that users will be able to bookmark certain urls to get straight to the content they need to get to.p  pFor example, lets say I have a page that details all of the registered users of my site and then each user has a profile page. I want that users who navigate to someones profile will see the following urlp  precodehttpmywebsite.comuserssomeusername codepre  pand that when they enter this url they will get to the profile of someusername. p  pThe problem is that all of the content was generated using ajax, and I manually changed the urls displayed using  history.pushState   so that when you enter the example url you simply get 404 page.p  pA simple solution I had in mind was to have a servlet mapped to the users pattern which responds with the correct jsp page. Is this is a reasonable solution or there are other better and acceptable ways to handle this kind of a problemp  pThanks p

Negative 2493 pInitially, I wrote a class lets call it codeRangeSetcode that operated on an codeArrayListcode of intervals the interval class defined by me as two Long values. The list was a collection of intervals, there was a codevoid addRange rangecode method which checked whether there was an overlap, overwriting, containment or adjacency with intervals already on the list. The point was to hold the list of nonoverlaping intervals.p  pI designed and wrote extensive tests for that class, checking the wide variety of cases that may occur. Its a lot of code is what Im saying.p  pNow it turns out that for whatever reason I had to split that class into two seperate classes  codeRangeSetcode will be an abstract class with a couple of useful methods and inherited from it  codeArrayRangeSetcode holding the collection of intervals in codeArrayListcode and codeTreeRangeSetcode holding the collection of intervals in a codeTreeSetcode. The implementation of codeaddRange rangecode method differs a lot between those two.p  pHow shall I inherit tests to avoid redundancy in defining test datap  pAn example test looks like thisp  precodeTest void testCase4     RangeSet set  new RangeSet     Range r1  new Range4, 5     Range r2  new Range13, 15     Range r3  new Range19, 22     set.addr1     set.addr2     set.addr3      Range testRange  new Range11,100     set.addtestRange      assertEquals2,set.iterator.size     assertEqualsnew Range4,5,set.iterator.getAt0     assertEqualsnew Range11,100,set.iterator.getAt1  codepre  pI dont know whether Im being clear Theres a lot of test data defining and tests for those two classes would look the same. How do I solve thatp  pEDIT Is there a way to pass those assert statements to inherited test classes Afterall, those codeaddcode methods are supposed to achieve the same goal, albeit by different operations.p

Negative 2493 pWhen i snmpWalk an ip, it takes 5 second. But if i send the snmpWalk request in a for loop, walk time goes up. Is there any good practice about using snmp in a multithread way or just use ExecutorService I used ExecutorService and it also slows down the snmp requests when the thread count is more. May be there is something wrong with my approach, i dont know. I will appricate it if there will be any other idea.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 2493 pI am using IOS 5.1 with Phonegap 1.3 and it seems, by default phonegap looks into ..LibraryCaches folder for a database. I want to upgrade to a suitable higher version like 1.8 or 2.0. Do these new versions support finding the db by default in ..Documents dir because this is a preferable location and not caches dir since IOS can anytime delete data from Cache when encountering low memory problems.p  pWhich is a suitable version of phonegap considering the above mentioned point plus I have android platform also using the same phonegap code. Any suggestions are most welcome. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 2493 peveryone here. Because OpenCL can run kernels on a CPU in a similar fashion as on a GPU. In a GPU, there are private memoryregisters and shared memory physically, but if I choose a CPU as the OpenCL device, how are private memory and shared memory implemented p  pI mean, are they emulated by DRAM or something elseL1, L2 even L3 cache I am not sure. Besides, the performance of using shared memory on CPU will be limited comparing with GPU, rightp

Negative 2493 pIm updating an app to use the latest Facebook SDK in order to gain access to the iOS6 native Facebook support.  It currently uses a pretty old version of the Facebook SDK.p  pThe app requires the publishactions permission from Facebook for the only thing it does with Facebook.p  pI initially thought I could use code[FBSession openActiveSessionWithPublishPermissions ...]code but this fails on iOS6 when the user has Facebook configured in iOS6 settings.  It fails because of this requirement, a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocshowtosios6 relnofollowfrom the Facebook docsap  blockquote   pNote, to use iOS 6 native auth, apps need change the way they request   permissions from users  apps must separate their requests for read   and write permissions. The Facebook SDK for iOS supports these   features and helps developers use them to build apps that work on   multiple iOS versions and device configurations.p blockquote  pThis is a big PITA, IMO.  Our preference would be to prompt the user once for permission and be done with it, but the new ideal per AppleFacebook is to prompt for specific permissions incontext when theyre needed but not yet granted.  p  pThe plan at the moment is to retain our old behavior for iOS5 users and iOS6 users who dont have Facebook configured in Settings.  And conform to the new doubleprompt for iOS6 users who are using nativeaccess.p  pstrongThe question is, whats the best way to do thisstrong  How should I go about detecting if the Facebook SDK will select the iOS6 native login vs the fallback mechanisms  Am I overlooking something obviousp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pgerraldWilliam put me onto the right track.  His solution would almost work except that ACAccountTypeIdentifierFacebook isnt available in iOS5.  Also that if the user blocks FB access in Settings to the app then the accountsWithAccountType call will return an empty array.p  pIts possible to get around the first problem by asking for the account type matching identifier com.apple.facebook  this will return nil on iOS5, and a real account type object on iOS6.p  pBut the second problem is unsolvable.  My new plan is to always open the initial session on iOS6 with readonly permissions and prompt later, in context, for publish permission if required.  On iOS5 Ill still open the initial session specifying the desired publishactions permission.  Heres the codep  precodeACAccountStore as  [[ACAccountStore new] autorelease]  ACAccountType at  [as accountTypeWithAccountTypeIdentifier com.apple.facebook]  if  at  nil        iOS6, call  [FBSession openActiveSessionWithReadPermissions ...]   else        iOS5, call [FBSession openActiveSessionWithPublishPermissions ...]   codepre

Negative 2493 pDelphis VCL has a very useful class, CustomControl. This class is a direct base class of Control, which is equivalent to C WFs UserControl.p  pFor those, who are not familiar with VCL, CustomControl differs very little from Control the main difference is that most of properties are protected when implementing the new control, developer may decide, which ones does he want to publish and which ones shall remain hidden.p  pIm developing my own control for Windows Forms and I want to hide some properties and events. For instance, I dont want to expose the MouseDown event  instead I allow capturing clicking on controls elements.p  pIs there an equivalent of VCLs CustomControl in Windows Forms If not, how can I hide unwanted public properties and events in my controlp  hr   pbIn response to answersbp  pThis is not a matter of security, but rather a matter of code ielegancei. In Delphi I can derive from CustomControl, leave the OnMouseDown event protected as in Cs protected and say to the controls userp  blockquoteYou cannot use OnMouseDown, because there is none. If you want to react to user clicking on control, simply use OnElementClicked  youll even get detailed information about which element was clicked and what was its state.blockquote  pI may disable calling the MouseDown event as Hans Passant suggested, but then I would have to include the following in the controls users manualp  blockquotePlease ido noti use the MouseDown event, because Ive overridden the OnMouseDown method, such that it wont call the MouseDown event. This is because the controls logic is designed in such way, that you should use OnElementClicked rather than OnMouseDown. Please idonti criticize the control because of MouseDown not working. Please idonti report it as a bug, because it is by design. Please idonti post messages in forums or create blog entries explaining how to fix the MouseDown problem by inheriting the class and manually calling the MouseDown event, because it would break the controls logic. Pleas idonti... damnit, told you soblockquote  pIf someone actually inherits from my control  I assume then, that he knows, what hes doing also because one would then gain access to my controls internal logic as well. But if someone just uses my control, I would give him only these properties, events and methods, that Im sure will work as designed.p  pI hope it explains my motives p

Negative 2493 pMy question is relevant to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq123360471815825thisa question, but Ive somehow moved a step further and implemented a test framework using nunit.p  pWhen I run the test framework addin inside Revit, the testing framework somehow locks the test assemblies making it impossible to recompile the test assemblies. To get around it, I tried making a shadow copy so the nunit test runner runs on the copied assemblies. But once I run the tests for the first time, the strongsubsequentstrong test runs does not work on updated copies. It is like the test runner caches the dlls and always tries to run tests on cached copy. p  pSo each time the test assembly is updated, I need to closereopen Revit to run the tests which is a real pain.

However,    if you change any configuration or code from libraries loaded here, youll    need to restart spork for it take effect.  end  Spork.eachrun do    This code will be run each time you run your specs.  end    Instructions   Sort the contents of this file into a Spork.prefork and a Spork.eachrun  block.   The Spork.prefork block is run only once when the spork server is started.  You typically want to place most of your slow initializer code in here, in  particular, requireing any 3rdparty gems that you dont normally modify  during development.   The Spork.eachrun block is run each time you run your specs.  In case you  need to load files that tend to change during development, require them here.  With Rails, your application modules are loaded automatically, so sometimes  this block can remain empty.   Note You can modify files loaded from the Spork.eachrun block without  restarting the spork server.  However, this file itself will not be reloaded,  so if you change any of the code inside the eachrun block, you still need to  restart the server.  In general, if you have nontrivial code in this file,  its advisable to move it into a separate file so you can easily edit it  without restarting spork.  For example, with RSpec, you could move  nontrivial code into a file specsupportmyhelper.rb, making sure that the  specsupport files are required from inside the eachrun block.   Any code that is left outside the two blocks will be run during preforking  and during eachrun  thats probably not what you want.   These instructions should selfdestruct in 10 seconds.

Negative 2493 pIve searched through google, but there doesnt seem to be anything on this. In almost every user interface, you can resize parts of it in order to make it more custom from the users perspective. For instants, in eclipse, one can resize the consul relative to the area with the code by clicking on the spot inbetween the two panelsparts and dragging. One can also click and drag the area in between the Package Explorer and the rest of the parts in order to resize that. How would I do this By this, I mean allow users to resize the amount of space given to each part of the layout How do I get the little divisionsignlike curser to show up What layout should I usep

Negative 2493 pI have a point in my mind which I cant figure out about new operator overloading. Suppose that, I have a class MyClass yet MyClass.h MyClass.cpp and main.cpp files are likep  precodeMyClass.h  class MyClass     public      Some member functions      void operator new sizet size      void operator delete void ptr      ...   MyClass.cpp  void MyClassoperator newsizet size     return mallocsize   void MyClassoperator deletevoid ptr     freeptr   main.cpp  Include files ...  int main     MyClass cPtr  new MyClass    delete cPtr   codepre  prespectively. This program is running just fine. However, the thing I cant manage to understand is, how come new operator can be called without any parameter while in its definition it has a function parameter like sizet size. Is there a point that I am missing here Thanks.p

I have not tested IE.p  pTesting in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari I noticed that this behaves differently for CSS codehovercode and JavaScript codeonmousedowncode when the cursor is just outside the area of the circle but inside the area of the rectangle that would be visible if codeborderradiuscode was not set. p  pHeres the results when the cursor is in that spotp  ul liChrome codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode affected outside the circleli liFirefox codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode only affected inside the circleli liOpera codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode affected outside the circleli liSafari codehovercode and codeonmousedowncode affected outside the circleli ul  pThe behavior Firefox has is the one Id like to consistently use, is there a way to make this possiblep  pstrongEditstrong If you find a solution please explain what browser you are using.p

Negative 2493 pI am implementing a program that uses the Python Numpy package. I am trying to modify the elements of an array so that I simply take elem[i][j] and set it to elem[i][j]10. However, I keep getting some sort of truncation where the elements are set to 0 after the operation. Here is my codep  precodefor  word in allwords     for x in xrangewordarrays[word].shape[0]         for y in xrangewordarrays[word].shape[1]             wordarrays[word][x][y]wordarrays[word][x][y]10 codepre  pIn my code wordarrays is a dictionary from strings to arrays. When I simply print wordarrays[word][x][y]10 truncation is not a problem and the float division proceeds as expected. I have checked and the arrays all have dtypefloat64 so that shouldnt be the problem. I also tried modifying the array through the method presented here using nditer  a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocnumpyreferencearrays.nditer.html relnofollowhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocnumpyreferencearrays.nditer.htmlap  pWhat is causing this truncation Thanks for the helpp  pEditp  pTo give some more detail regarding my unusual output. Before the division, the entries of wordarray[chen] are as followsp  precode[[2. 3.]  [4. 1.]] codepre  pAfter the division by 10 or 10.0 I get this for the same arrayp  precode[[1.01000000e04   1.20000000e05] [1.11001000e01   1.00000000e06]] codepre  pWhich doesnt seem to make any sense. I recognize that the double forloops arent that pythonic but this was what I thought to try when iterating with np.nditer didnt work. To address some of the comments, I did try dividing by both 10 and 10.0. The outcome was the same.p  pAlso, when I perform the same operation without replacing the entries of the array and just print the division, i.e.p  precodefor  word in allwords   for x in xrangewordarrays[word].shape[0]      for y in xrangewordarrays[word].shape[1]             print wordarrays[word][x][y]10 codepre  pI get what is expected, namelyp  precode[[0.2 0.3]  [0.4 0.1]] codepre
Negative 2493 pIm building an app thats kind of a canvaspaint art generator. The details arent important  what is important is ensuring that the same image is never saved twice.p  pIts fine if the same image is generated more than once, but before it gets saved I need to check all images todate for an identical copy. Eventually there are going to be thousands  even millions  of these images, so its pretty unreasonable to store the raw files and check every single one against the active. Is there a way to reduce an image file to a unique key or stringp  pI considered some kind of SHA conversion  it would be really easy to check an images hash against a table of logged hashes  but there is a distressing lack of information on the topic, and SHA has a small possibility of duplicates.

Negative 2493 pI am using titanium appcelerator for android to write my app.p  pOn my main screen i have a tableView, full of listings that are rows, that paginates 15 at a time. So once u scroll down to 15th row another 15 rows will be added to the table. A screen usually shows 3 to 10 of the rows at a time depending on screen height samsung mini vs nexus 7p  pEach row contains a view which contains several child Views and imageViews. This cause very slow performance when scrolling up and down the list. To solve this i turned the parent view which is added to the row into an image, which increased performance massively when scrolling.p  pHere is a general snippetp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode    Turn the entire view postview into an image. postview consists of many child views         var blob  postview.toImagenull, true      Create the Image view of entire postview, the parent of all child views     var tempImage  Ti.UI.createImageView     height  auto,     width  auto,     top  0,     zindex  3,     image  blob                      adding the ImageView created from the parent view which all child ies have      been added to    row.addtempImage      This is the array of rows to be added to the tableView      tabData[i]  row       ........      tableView.appendRowtabData codepre  pHowever, especially on larger screens when u scroll the app crashes, which using DDMS shows as OutOfMemory error. Which unfortunately i cant post the specific error right now because i dont have access to a larger device now. Also the memory error does also occur when i dont use the method of changing the entire view to an image, but gives less detail on the errors themselves in DDMS.p  pSo im not sure if its related to the toImage method, or im not freeing memory properly in javascript, or if its a titanium or java issue or what.p  pAnyone any ideas. This has been a problem im trying to fix for a few weeks. I wish i had the specific java errors on hand. But they mostly refer to OutOfMemoryp

Negative 2493 h3Basic Questionh3  pI want to be able to locally build with maven a patched fork of some Java github code using Jenkins and then publish it to Artifactory or some equivalent repository manager. Is there a pattern for doing this Is there a way for me to build a project and publish it using someone elses POM but patching the version number and SCM details p  h3Backgroundh3  pMy company has a Java project which depends on an external Java module. We use Artifactory to manage our dependencies to do this. No problem here.p  pHowever, occasionally we want to make code changes bug fixes or enhancements to the external Java module lets call it CoolFramework 1.0 and say that its source is freely available on GitHub. So I fork the repository, make the code change and issue a pull request. Sometime later, the owner of the CoolFramework project decides to release version 1.1 of the project with my bug fix or shiny new feature.p  pThe question I have relates to the time in between. Clearly, I want to be able to have the bug fixes or enhancements in my project as soon as Ive developed them. Id like to push them into Artifactory as a kind of snapshot release perhaps versioned as coolframework1.0MYCOMPANY1 where the 1 at the end represents the Jenkins build number or some other unique reference. However, all of the release management stuff that maven does seems to relate to either publishing a SNAPSHOT or pushing the final release and doesnt deal with this intermediate process understandably.p  pIs there a common process for doing this Mr Google didnt find one for me but then I may not be asking him the right questions.p

Negative 2493 pI am learning and loving Java and Android but have a long way to go. This is a best practice question, I think. In my Android Activity I have 6 classes. Several of them are calling methods that I have duplicated from another class. It seems redundant to duplicate the methods when I could just call them from another class. I also think it would be easier to maintain them all in one class. Main activity, maybe My question is What is the best practice for calling the same method from more than one class For example, say my classes arep  pMain Activity GameSelector Game1Home Game1p  pI have a few methods which are the same in every class. Lets call them getPrefs and setPrefs. I am not passing anything into them or out of them. Which class should they go in, and how do I call them from another classp  pstrongEdit  Thanks to some very helpful answersstrong I have a fully functioning Configurations class and my other 6 classes look much cleaner This will be very easy to maintain and I learn a few great pointers while making it.

Negative 2493 piterate through a 3d matrixp  pi need to check every possible solution to a certain predicament.p  pi have a matrix[x][y][z] that represents possible nodes to travel through. I already finished a method that should give me a set of solutions it disables a single path every iteration and recalculates the entire solution, disable priority is based on travel capacity of the last solution but i need to see how effective my method is in terms of total time taken to calculate a set. For this i require a method calculate the solution on every permutation of these paths. p  pcurrently it only has a single layer in between 2 main layers L1 where 0 is a free path and 1 is a non accessible path. This here is the starting layout where i can toggle the values on layer L1 from 0 to 1 to disable a path and the basis of my shortest path search algorithm.p  precodeL0 0 0 0 0 0  L1  0 1 0 1 0  L2  0 0 0 0 0    0 1 0 1 0      1 1 1 1 1      0 1 0 1 0    0 0 0 0 0      0 1 0 1 0      0 0 0 0 0     0 1 0 1 0      1 1 1 1 1      0 1 0 1 0     0 0 0 0 0      0 1 0 1 0      0 0 0 0 0  codepre  phow can i iterate through every possible combination of disabling the free paths when the dimensions of the matrix are non constant meaning they are already user defined on compile time and can be changed whenever there are 2n solutions where n is the number of free path on all mediary layers. a quick explanation in C or C would be best, even pseudo code is good since there currently 9 free path to make combinations with there should be about 29 solutions which i need to test with.

Negative 2493 pI was working on a project in Android Studio and was regularly compiling the code running it on my device to make sure everything was in working order. Suddenly the main activity crashes, several times after compiling several separate times. I checked the logcat and the error was reported as being due to failure to recognize the layout. I didnt understand why, as I hadnt changed any of the code in the main activity.p  pIn fact the only thing that had changed over the course of those few days was that I had added a bunch of new layouts into the large, xlarge and landscape layout folders. I deleted the codesetContentViewR.layout.mainscreencode and rewrote it verbatim and the code worked. I proceeded to the second activity and again a crash, this time due to a null pointer exception again I had made no changes. I tried copying the code, deleted the Activity, created a new one with the same name, and pasted the code. Suddenly it worked fine. This happened in almost EVERY activity, crashes and errors for seemingly random reasons all of which were fixed by simply copying the code and pasting it verbatim.p  pHas anyone run into something similar or does anyone have any idea why something like this may have happenedp

Negative 2493 pIm building a Joomla template and as you may now the main body of the content is the component similar to the loop in wordpress and there can only be 1 component on a page and there must be a component. So my template has 3 columns which as standard are...p  precodesidebarmodule  maincomponent  sidebarmodule codepre  pHowever, I am using some conditional code in with my html to only show the html for the sidebars if the sidebar has been set like this...p  precodeltLEFT Sidebar1 gt         ltphp if thisgtcountModulessidebar1  gt         ltaside classspanltphp echo spanSidebar1gt idsidebar1gt             ltjdocinclude typemodules namesidebar1 stylehtml5 gt         ltasidegt         ltphp endif gt codepre  pSo, this gives me the option to have all 3 columns, just the main column or the main column and 1 sidebar columns depending on whether content has been assigned to the modules or not. As you can see I have also included a variable for setting the width of these sidebar columns in span sizes to give a flexible layout from the admin panel. This all works fine.p  pHowever, I would also like to add some logic that allows me, again by setting parameters in the backend, to choose to either have both sidebars to the right or to the left giving me these options sb1  sidebar1 etc...p  precodesb1  sb2  main  sb2  sb1  main  sb1  main  sb2  main  sb1  sb2  main  sb2  sb1 codepre  pHowever, it is all getting rather complex and messy. I would then have to have 5 different html layout options shown or not shown based on whether sb1, sb2 and main were set as first, second or third respectively and due to restriction in the admin panel I cant prevent somebody from assigning them all as first or whatever.p  pBasically, I am fairly new to PHP and programming and this is doing my head in. Does anybody with experience know of a better or simpler way  I mean I feel that I am overlooking some kind of simpler and more elegant solution  it feels like it is staring me in the face but I cant see it.p

Negative 2493 pI am creating a c library that uses service references. I dont want the entire service to be accessible outside the library. So I first used AutoMapper to copy the service classes that I needed in to similar classes in my library. The second step was to make the service references internal. My main problem now is that there doesnt seem to be any auto mapping libraries that support internal access. Ive tried a hrefhttpautomapper.org relnofollowAutoMappera, a hrefhttpemitmapper.codeplex.com relnofollowEmitMappera, and a hrefhttpvalueinjecter.codeplex.com relnofollowValueInjectera libraries and all my copied objects have nulldefault values. AutoMapper has a a hrefhttpsgithub.comAutoMapperAutoMapperissues218 relnofollowgithub issuea related to supporting internal, but there is no indication of when we will see it.p  pIve decided to try something oddball which was to Serialize the service class using a hrefhttpjames.newtonking.comjson relnofollowJSON.NETa and then to Deserialize it in to the library class. This works pretty well but I wonder how this compares to libraries like AutoMapper in terms of performance. I know that EmitMapper is king as far as performance.p  pHas anyone found an auto mapping solution that works for internalsp
Negative 2493 pWe have really big rails application and currently we are switching from TestUnitfixtures to RspecFactoryGirl. Our database has a lot of system tables where data is either constant or updated rarely. For examplep  precodeusertypes ID  NAME                       ... 1   System Adminisrator        ... 2   Organization Administrator ... .... 9   Mega Administrator         ... codepre  pIn additional we have a lot of configuration tables and long references between them. For examplep  precodemasterorganizations manytomany organizations hasmany  planyears hasmany products hasmany plans  organizations hasmany employees ... and so on codepre  pAnd we need all system tables and at least one organization configured before all the specs run. And then each suite will be able to add additional data to db if needed.p  pSo strongthe question isstrong how to build a nice, complex and flexible structure which is readable for a developer Today the closest solution for us is to move db structure creation into separate files create there sharedcontexts for system tables, configuration tables and so on. And then include it if necessary. But not sure if this approach is good.p

Negative 2493 pSolaris 10 SPARCBR Sun Studio C compiler 12.3p  pOn SPARC64 machines if you access a variable which isnt correctly aligned on the relevant 4 or 8 byte boundary, you will get a core dump.

I want to be able to store information like time of registration unique for every registered key, therefore I will most probably use a MySQL database.p  pMy biggest concern is how to generate and verify the codes themselvesp  ol liGenerate all of the product keys randomly still unique and insert them into the MySQL database.li liDesign some sort of key that would be easily checked if valid. For example a salted hash as last few symbols in the key.li ol  pI feel that the first option is a bit simpler and secure, but I am worried about the performance, as some products would be registered at the same time as a new bunch of keys are provisioned to the packaging factory.p  pIs there any other information I should give Would using language, other than PHP save benefit the performance as wellp  pstrongEDIT I will probably use some chippers or other algorithms to convert from ID number to code and back on my end.strongp

Negative 2493 pI am not able to understand one important aspect of Android software design which I am just starting out with, from what I know codeFragmentcode design has been adopted in order to decouple the code, where the intuition is that the codeActivitycode remains as is and codeFragmentcode can be emreusedem else where, maybe even in a different activity, or maybe along side other fragments, in something like a MasterDetail flow or landscape UI.p  pOkay so I have seen quite a handful of questions on SO asking as to why codeFragmentscode are placed as static inner classes within an codeActivitycode and the answer there is that if we do not make them static, the codeFragmentcode may hold a reference to the activity and something like a screen rotation or a redraw might leak the activity or something.p  pThis brings me back to square one and I have the question that, well, if the Fragment design has been adopted in order to decouple the code, then why are we marrying the codeFragmentcode to the codeActivitycode by putting it eminsideem the activity class and not putting them as standalone public classes Isnt that totally contradicting to the very existence of Fragmentsp  pWhat is the down side of having a project structure as such Where each codeFragmentcode is a separate class of its own Given that my Fragment code can grow to like a 1000 lines especially when trying to do animations I am seeing this as far more neater, decoupled and reusable within activities other than its intended parent Activity. p  ul liDo we still suffer from the memory leak issue mentioned aboveli liAm I missing something about the design logic Please educate me.li liIs there a way where the Fragments stay as an inner class and still be used elsewhere I might be missing something here as well... so do inform me.li ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZEvmr.png altProject structurep  pAny other project design methods, concepts, corrections to my intuition are more than welcome since I am just starting out here, I would love to know all my options.p  pThank you p

So lets say I have this URL OwnedQuoteAircraftRegNumberCreate that I got to using RedirectToAction in a controller omitting the http localhost portion of the URL due to stack overflow requirements.  If you look at the properties of the image in this case the url for the image is Imagesdigitalbluestd.jpg which is what I want.  However, when is use an actionlink from that page to another page in the same area, the url for the same image is OwnedQuoteImagesdigitalbluestd.jpg.  Notice the addition of the area now which is a problem because the image does not exist in this location.  My action link command is just p  precodeHtml.ActionLinkReferral to UW, ReferToUW, Referral, New With .id  Model.Aircraft.ID, Nothing codepre  pEverything else from the layout page and the body section is correct. So Im not sure why the image URL is different when using Html.ActionLink vs RedirectToAction.  I need it to act the same as RedirectToAction.  p

Negative 2493 pAre there any real pitfalls in using single process mode in production The official statement seems to discourage this, but so far the application has been stable.

Or is that not truep  pAlso, is CEF3 single process not equivalent to CEF1 The new Battle.net launcher is using CEFl 1453.

Negative 2493 pMy title is a bit complex, but I will break down really simply what I am doing here. p  pI have an existing database with about 20 tables. I have a project that my partner has decided that we should use the old Simple Membership over Identity. This is no longer an option on the table, we have finalized that decision. WE will be creating the project in Web Forms using Visual Studio 2012 because that is what we have licenses for.p  pstrongStep 1strong I started a new project in VS 2012 using Web Forms and I pointed the Default Connection String at my current database and registered a few users. This created the tables I needed for membership in my SQL Server 2012 database.p  pstrongStep 2strong I did some relational mapping in my database connecting existing tables to the new membership UserIDs where needed so that my existing tables are now related to the membership stuff. p  pstrongStep 3strong Here is where I am a bit lost because normally I have used SqlDataSources with Web Forms in the past. I have some experience with MVC so I would like to do things differently in this web forms project and start from Database First and import my database tables into a Data Access Layer, Im thinking of using a Class Library for this.p  pMY QUESTION strongWhen importing my EDMX for database first. Should Ibr A Bring in all of the tables Existing Tables  New Membership Tablesbr B Just bring in the Tables that are NOT part of Membershipbr C Bring in my Existing Tables and only the User and Membership table or D Do you have any other ideastrong    p  pMy reasoning for this question is that I know that I can access the Membership stuff in the Web Forms Project but will it possibly be needed in the Class Library since my application will eventually be very User centric. Lots of tracking of user time and logins, assigning tasks and projects, permissions to that user etc.. I was leaning toward strongAstrongp  pI know this is a very complex question or maybe I should say it may have many answers all due to things that I may not know yet or I have not explained fully.

Negative 2493 pIve got a few questions here regarding Node, IRC bots, and Meteor.p  pIm part of a gaming community thats starting to deal with Twitch.TV streaming, and as such have been asked due to my love of programming to write a custom bot to moderate community streaming channels.p  pMy questions are thesep  p1 What would be the best way to link an IRC bot which will be written using the IRC library in Node.JS and a webbased administration system which will be built using Meteor.p  pI was told that I could probably use the MongoDB instance used by Meteor as a connection point between the two halves of the project, and that makes perfect sense, using DDP, or whatever.p  pFor the transmission of data, that seems fine, but what if I wanted to be able to actually CONTROL the bot using the interface, in ways such as allowing a user to control joiningparting of his channel via his control panelp  p2 My other inquiry is regarding the bot Node and being able to detect new users, and the ability to automatically join their channels when accounts are created.  I know that Meteor is reactive, and can instantly deal with changes to the MongoDB instance, but wasnt sure if you could do that with regular Node, or if so...how difficult it would be.p  pMaybe I should just forego the automatic thing, and have the user manually have the bot join their channel after theyve logged into their new account, allowing them to configure the bot to their liking custom commands, etc. before being used for the first time.p  pThanks to everyone in advance for their time in reading this novella of information, its really appreciated.p

Negative 2493 pSay I would like to remove rows or add rows to a table. Is it smarter for me to modify the data source and let the table do updates or use UITableViews insertRowsAtIndexPathswithAnimation and deleteRowsAtIndexPathswithAnimation selectors Whenever I try to modify the actual data source array, whose size is also used to determine in the the data sources tableViewnumberOfCellsInSection protocol method, I am thrown an error saying that the table must have the same number of cells per section before and after a table update. The data source array itself is an NSMutableArray does this array get automatically updated when I use the deleteRowsAtIndexPaths and insertRowsAtIndexPaths selectors I would assume not. But how do I add or remove rows while also updating the data source arrayp
Negative 2493 pHave a very werid issue. My machine is Windows7 64bit. My listbox scrolls properly on all our 64bit computers at work. However, on the 32bit systems the listbox does not scroll properly. When a user clicks the down arrow to navigte down the listbox list, it goes down but then jumps right back up to the top. It does not matter if it was done by arrows, mousewheel, or clicking in the scrollbar area. Has anyone come across this werid issue before, and figured out a way to resolve it I have tried releasing with cpu x86 and All cpu and still same issue either way.p  pAnother note Another issue I encountered betweeen 64it and 32bit OS was binding a datagrid to a datatable. On my system if the datatable had zero rows in it, it still bound with no issues, but on the 32bit systems we get a binding error trying to bind to a datatable with a row count of zero.

However, I would of course prefer to not have to write out each instance and then write out each call. I would prefer to run for loops in both cases.p  pI could of course, use lists, but when I tried it did not work because I could not iterate through lists of objects in the function fnwithargs. args however, can be iterated through. So my question presently is how can I pass args into the runloop call so I can simply call it oncep  pOr if there is a way I can iterate over the list of objects I suppose that is an option too however I would prefer to not do this because it requires many more lines of code and a fair bit of restructuring.p  pAny and all input appreciated, let me know if I need explain more,p  pThanksp  pPS I realize also that I could simply pass the elements of the object into a list but this presents different problems for the program and seems counter to oop structure.p  pEDIT Examplep  precodenumber  5 clas2ob1   Clas2arg for i in rangenumber     clas1ob1  Clas1arg1, arg2     clas2ob1.runloopclas1ob1, none This is the structure I want but this will obviously just overwrite 5 times The arguments in this case also become incorrect codepre

Negative 2493 pIts a weird senario. We use a x86 soc as the host and a stm8s MCU as client. They are connected with 2 wires between the GPIOssOC side and RST and SWIMMCU side. So in this way we can reflash the MCU firmware by the SWIM protocol.p  pHere is the problem. After we enter the SWIM modeenter sequence is easily UPDOWN by gpio operations on low frequency, we need to send data to MCU. But the protocol need to send data with a high frequency16M clock. I have try with a simple gpio operation with no delayp  precodefori0 ilt10 i      gpiosetvalueSWIM, 0     gpiosetvalueSWIM, 1  codepre  pBut on the oscilloscope the pulse will delay 2ns for both UPDOWN. I think it maybe the io speed limit or some other system reason. As the SWIM protocol said, to send data the minimal delay is about 0.25ns.p  pAre there any ways to speed up the GPIO operations or do we have some special method to apply this requestp  pBTW We are using linux on the soc.p

Negative 2493 pIm running into quite a strange behaviour using Linq to Entity code first. p  pAll my entities, context, databases are working fine, its an ongoing project that is developped, updated and online for two years. Im using .NET 4.5, EF 5. For that specific query, LazyLoading is disabled not that activating it changes anything.p  pI have the following tables Im only mentionning what is related to the issue  p  ul liGames, which holds the gamesli liPress, which holds press articles about gamesli liPressTypes, which holds the categories for a press articleli liPressGames, which defines a one to many between Press to Games one article can be about many gamesli ul  pAbout the tables and their matching entity  p  ul liGames has many fields, but lets say that it just holds two  ID guid and Name, the games name. li liPress also has many fields, amongst which we have  ID guid, CategoryID guid and UpdateDate DateTime that represents the last time the article has been updated.li liPress Entity has a Category Object, and an IEnumerable Games.li liGame Entity does NOT have a Press navigation property intended and needed this wayli liPressTypes is the list of the press article categories, and has an ID guidli liPressGames has two fields, GameID guid and PressID guidli ul  pI need to get the list of the 5 games that are linked to the latest press articles of a specific category. I retrieve them through the following query  p  precodeContext.Press     .Wherepress gt press.Category.ID  MagicValues.ReviewGuid  MagicValues.ReviewGuid returns a Guid     .OrderByDescendingpress gt press.UpdateDate     .SelectManypress gt press.Games     .Take5 codepre  pThe resulting list get a list of games, but not the one matching the expected chronological articles order. Using LINQPad I noticed that the generated query is the following  p  precodeSELECT TOP 5  [Join1].[ID] AS [ID],  [Join1].[Name] AS [Name],  FROM  [dbo].[Press] AS [Extent1] INNER JOIN  SELECT [Extent2].[PressID] AS [PressID], [Extent3].[ID] AS [ID]  lots of selected fields      FROM  [dbo].[PressGames] AS [Extent2]     INNER JOIN [dbo].[Games] AS [Extent3] ON [Extent3].[ID]  [Extent2].[GameID]  AS [Join1] ON [Extent1].[ID]  [Join1].[PressID] WHERE castb5c1818314e24bf2b4e1641b56694c55 as uniqueidentifier  [Extent1].[CategoryID] codepre  pNo ORDER BY. If I alter slightly the query to select the articles instead of the games, I get the proper list of articles, and their games, in the expected order  p  precodeContext.Press     .Includepress gt press.Games     .Wherepress gt press.Category.ID  MagicValues.ReviewGuid  MagicValues.ReviewGuid returns a Guid     .OrderByDescendingpress gt press.UpdateDate     .Take25 codepre  pThe generated SQL query becomes  p  precodeSELECT  [Project2].[C1] AS [C1],  [Project2].[ID] AS [ID],  [Project2].[Name] AS [Name],  FROM        Lots of irrelevant stuff with JOINs and SELECTs    AS [Project2] ORDER BY [Project2].[UpdateDate] DESC, [Project2].[ID] ASC, [Project2].[C2] ASC codepre  pI get the ORDER BY back which was more or less expected as its working. p  pstrongSo finaly my question is  is this behavior expected or is it a bug strong p  pIm thinking that since Im using SelectMany, EF seems to think that only the Games table is required and thus ignore the OrderBy on Press. It could make sense, but seems a bit counterintuitive. p  pIll find a way to circumvent the issue unless there is actually a clean fix for this but Im mostly curious about the behavior and the explanation. p

Negative 2493 pFrom Android Studio, I have made a new Android Module apply plugin com.android.library which contains some java classes,  a res folder with some resources, and an AndroidManifest.xml file which holds some exported elements, such as a BroadcastReceiver, which I would like the projects to have merged inside their AndroidManifest. This library module works great when I export it as an AAR, or publish it to a maven repo, and other applications can use it properly any way they like.p  pI would like this library to be available for android applications which use Eclipse as their dev environment, and there still seems to be some people which still use Eclipse probably for historical reasons. So, my question is do Eclipse android applications have a way to import AAR libs If not, should I consider making a JAR lib Inside this JAR lib, should I include resources What about the manifest file If I dont include it inside the JAR, should I guide users to modify their manifest when using this JARp  pThanks for any help.p

After having a similar problem I updated my JDBC driver mysqlconnectorjava5.1.26bin.jar. The error then changed from      User does not have access to metadata required to determine stored procedure parameter types. If rights can not be granted, configure connection with noAccessToProcedureBodiestrue to have driver generate parameters that represent INOUT strings irregardless of actual parameter types.  to      No access to parameters by name when connection has been configured not to access procedure bodies  I changed my Callable Statement to reference parameters by index instead of name, and hey presto it works.  Updating the driver may not be necessary, just knowing to use indexes instead of names when you dont have metadata access or routine body access.

Negative 2493 pI have a question and hope you can help me with it. Ive been busy making a game with xna and have recently started getting into shaders hlsl. Theres this shader that i like, use, and would like to improve. p  pThe shader creates an outline by drawing the back faces of a model in black, and translating the vertex along its normal. Now, for a smoothshaded model, this is fine. I, however, am using flatshaded models Im posting this from my phone, but if anyone is confused about what that means, I can upload a picture later. This means that the vertices are translated along the normal of its corresponding face, resulting in visible gaps between the faces. p  pNow, the question is is there a way to calculate either in the shader or in xna, how i should translate each vertex, or is the only viable option just making a copy of the 3d model, but with smooth shadingp  pThanks in advance, hope you can educate mep  pEDIT Alternatively, I could load only a smoothshaded model, and try to flatshade it in the shader. That would, however, mean that I have to be able to find the normals of all vertices of the corresponding face, add their normals, and normalize the result. Is there a way to do this p  pEDIT2 So far, Ive found a few options that dont seem to work in the end setting shademode in hlsl is now deprecated. Setting the fillmode to wireframe would be neat while culling front faces, if only I would be able to set the line thickness. p  pIm working on a new idea here.

Negative 2493 pI have a fairly simple Rails app running on Heroku where end users can upload two photos and receive a link to the photo via email and SMS.p  pThe app was originally running Paperclip in realtime and timing out sometimes because of Herokus 30second limit.

This works perfectly  except it continues to time out upon create, and when I look in the lower left of my browser it says Uploading XX as though it is uploading the alreadyuploaded files upon create. I am pulling my hair out.p  pAgain, the photos load fine to S3. On a fast connection, this does not time out, and everything works fine.

Negative 2493 pI have a C Visual Studio object in my project.p  pI have numerous forms and classes that use X to call CLR methods out of the C project.  These all worked fine until 2012R3 came out.  p  pA standard compile of anything touching the CLR objects fails, saying the CLR method does not exist.  And if I do a CIL compile to catch the C objects, it says that failed because the standard methods did not successfully compilethe same ones that couldnt compile due to missing CLR objects.  It appears to be a neverending circle.p  pI can take the exact same model file and install in a 2012 R2 system, and everything compiles perfectly.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 2493 pSometimes stupid things come to mind but Im wondering if you could share some insight on this situation.p  pLets say I want to create a sort of service which is able to connect to a remote server via FTP or something else. If someone would create an account for the service they would need to store their login credentials. Naturally you want to save the data secure and many topics on password hashing exist. But what if you need to use that password later In this case to connect to the remote host.p  pA real life example Im using the services of CodeAnywhere in case I dont have access to a computer with development software. This situation applies there as well.p  pThe connection then goes from server A to server B. On server A stuff files are managed using server B. On server B an account is created to use the service from server B and a connection is made to server A, storing the authorisation data for server A.p  pAre people creating their own hashing rules to be able to store something like codemypasswordcode as codedrowsappymcode. In this example the password is reverted. But other things come to mind as well use unicode points for each character,  or create a mapping schema for each character for example codeai,bQ,c, and so on..code. Of course you dont want to only secure the password, but all authorisation data.p  pLooking forward to the replies. p

Negative 2493 pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netswoq9g3f1 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netswoq9g3f1ap  pI am having a problem where a simple SVG is drawn incorrectly in Internet Explorer v11.0.9600.17728 after I change a codexlinkhrefcode with javascript.p  pIf you render just the SVG in IE you get two concentric circles. The javascript sets the codexlinkhrefcode value for a codeltusegtcode element to codedef1code, which is the value it was previously. After this IE renders only the larger circle, with the smaller circle hidden behind it. The smaller circle is later in the svg document meaning that it should always render on top of the larger circle. I also included some calls to codeforceRedrawcode, but they fail to correct the issue.p  pThis problem does not happen in Chrome or Firefox.

Negative 2493 pIm fairly new to Javascript promises, and running into an issue that I cant hunt down anything about via Google or Stack Exchange. When I refer to a function in a .then chained off a promise, I sometimes have to wrap that function in an anonymous function in order to stop it from automatically executing before the original promise is resolved. For example, if my code isp  precodefunction deleteAdvertiseradvertiser      dialogService.Confirmnull, Delete         .thenadvertiserService.deleteAdvertiseradvertiser         .thengetAdvertisers  codepre  pthe call to advertiserService.deleteAdvertiser will automatically fire before I resolve the promise from the dialogService.Confirm. However, if I write it asp  precodefunction deleteAdvertiseradvertiser      dialogService.Confirmnull, Delete         .thenfunction               advertiserService.deleteAdvertiseradvertiser                 .thengetAdvertisers               codepre  pit behaves as expected the advertiserService.deleteAdvertiser call doesnt happen until I resolve the dialogService.Confirm promise in this case by clicking the Delete button inside my confirmation dialog.p  pThe dialogService uses ngDialogs .openConfirm method, which returns a promise. Ive verified that this promise is returning correctly. My best guess as to why this is happening is that my need to pass along an advertiser object from the UI the function is initially called via an ngclick on a trash can button means that I have to call advertiserService.deleteAdvertiseradvertiser that is to say, with an argument passed in which in turn means that JS is executing that function call as soon as it reads it, rather than just storing the reference to use later when the initial promise is resolved.p  pAm I correct in my understanding of why the first code block doesnt work Why does wrapping it in an anonymous function make the difference And is there a correct or at least better way to chain these promisesp  pThank youp

Because when I put the path directly as, code         ltimg src uploadspictureimage987thumbimages.jpg gtcode it works fine. But pictures are dynamic.

Negative 2493 pWhat is the best way to achieve DB consistency in microservicebased systemsp  pAt the a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvwgdBVIX9ifAGOTO in Berlina, Martin Fowler was talking about microservices and one rule he mentioned was to keep perservice databases, which means that services cannot directly connect to a DB owned by another service.p  pThis is supernice and elegant but in practice it becomes a bit tricky. Suppose that you have a few servicesp  ul lia frontendli lian ordermanagement serviceli lia loyaltyprogram serviceli ul  pNow, a customer make a purchase on your frontend, which will call the order management service, which will save everything in the DB  no problem. At this point, there will also be a call to the loyaltyprogram service so that it credits  debits points from your account.p  pNow, when everything is on the same DB  DB server it all becomes easy since you can run everything in one transaction if the loyalty program service fails to write to the DB we can roll the whole thing back.p  pWhen we do DB operations throughout multiple services this isnt possible, as we dont rely on one connection  take advantage of running a single transaction. What are the best patterns to keep things consistent and live a happy lifep  pIm quite eager to hear your suggestions..and thanks in advancep

The PS script results the the times as I expected, quite different on almost every DC not all differs from the others but most of them. The .Net program however returns the same time from all DC instances and in addition it returns a time that do not displays in the PS scriptp  pNow Im quite confused. I believe the PS script is the correct one, but then I really do not know what did I missed in the .Net version.p  pI did some debug on the program but the found user contains only the time that the program displays, and even the filetime value different from the PS version. I even thought on datetime conversion issue, but then the structure of the result should be the same with different values, but they arent.p  pThx in advance for any sort of help.  p

Negative 2493 pIve recently started using Robolectric for unit testing some of my android applications and have stumbled across a problem. In a few places I use AsyncTasks to do some background computations, and then update the UI depending on the outcome of these calculations. If I use codeexecutecode to exectue the AsyncTask, when I run my tests to check if the UI has been correctly update it passes. However, for various reasons, I am actually using codeexectueOnExecutorcode with the codeTHREADPOOLEXECUTORcode parameter. When I run the tests with this the tests fail with it thinking that the UI has not been updated. Similarly if I do this from a thread and post back to the UI thread I have the same issue. Is there any way around thisp
Negative 2493 pI have a problem with my ckeditor, if I add a image with caption without use before enter or other character I cant use backspace for delete character on image caption, but if I press other character from a to z I see this is put on caption. This is happened only on mozila firefox, and I see a codebrcode with codemozeditorbogusnodeTRUEcode. After press enter and add a new paragraph this codebrcode is removed and never see it, and more then that I can edit image caption I can delete character from caption after first paragraph insertion.p

Negative 2493 pIm developing an app that is basically an infinite mural for users to draw pixel art a hrefhttppixelmural.com relnofollowhttppixelmural.coma. Users should be able to move around the mural freely, but every time they move, I have to update the pixels they see, and that requires a request to the server to get the pixel data. At first I was transmitting the data as JSON, and it was super slow. Then I switched to PNG, and things got much faster. Now Im wondering if there is some way to transmit the data even faster, so that moving around would be smoother. I think my problem is similar to that of data transmission when moving around in maps, but unlike maps my info isnt vectors but pixels.p  pOne thing I could still do to improve performance is to only load the new pixels, rather than the whole screen as Im currently doing. However before I code that, I wanted to ask if there is a better approach altogether. I feel I may be doing it all wrong.p

Negative 2493 pI am trying to wrap my head around the concepts of codeThreadcode, codeLoopercode and codeHandlercode architecture in Android. So as of my understanding at the moment, we can associate a thread with a looper and handler.

Negative 2493 pIs there a catchall for incoming Socket.io eventsp  pMaybe this is a trivial question, but Im drawing a blank. I was just working on a client side message handler to handle messages incoming from local functions and also messages incoming from the socket, so I want to feed any incoming socket events to the message handler. p  pObviously codesocket.oneventName, functiondata ... code will handle specific events, but how do I detect any potential incoming event rather than a specific one p  pIm basically trying to do something like thisp  precodevar messengerBlueprint       guest continue function name          console.logGuest Continue message handler triggered Message   name         localStorage.setItemname, name         MySession.triggerclick     ,         create session function name          console.logCreate Session message handler triggered Message   name         socket.emitcreate session, name     ,   function handleMessagetype, message      if messengerBlueprint[type]          messengerBlueprint[type]message      else          console.logMessage discarded No matching Message Type was found.        App.Messenger       input function messageObj          handleMessagemessageObj.type, messageObj.message       codepre  pAnd then to handle socket events with my message handling function, theoretically something likep  precodesocket.eventApp.Messenger.inputdata codepre  pI know could cycle through my blueprint and use codesocket.oncode for each socket event but this would be a lot of extra code when it seems I should be able to just use a catch all and handle nonaccepted incoming events in my own way. p
