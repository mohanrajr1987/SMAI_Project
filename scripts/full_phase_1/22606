Positive 22606 pI have a UIWebView that opens and directs to Twitters OauthAuthorize webpage.

What happens now is when the WebView detects a hrefhttpstwitter.comoauthauthorizeoauthtoken relnofollowhttpstwitter.comoauthauthorizeoauthtokena instead of staying in the WebView it opens the native Twitter application and dies.

Negative 22606 pDoes anyone know of an algorithm to find if a linked list loops on itself using only two variables to traverse the list.  Say you have a linked list of objects, it doesnt matter what type of object.  I have a pointer to the head of the linked list in one variable and I am only given one other variable to traverse the list with.  p  pSo my plan is to compare pointer values to see if any pointers are the same.  The list is of finite size but may be huge.  I can set both variable to the head and then traverse the list with the other variable, always checking if it is equal to the other variable, but, if I do hit a loop I will never get out of it.  Im thinking it has to do with different rates of traversing the list and comparing pointer values.  Any thoughtsp

Negative 22606 pIve been trying to encapsulate the object mapping in a projects data repository. Perhaps EF will provide the level of abstraction required but for a range of reasons I am using Linq to SQL at the moment. The following code aims to return the users in the database as a list of ModUser objects, where ModUser is POCO that the repository exposesp  precodepublic ListltModUsergt GetUsers      Users.SelectMapUser.ToList   public ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt MapUser      get          return u gt new ModUser              UserId  u.UserId,             UserResources  u.ResourcesMapResource                 public ExpressionltFuncltResource, ModResourcegtgt MapResource  ... codepre  pThe code will fail as I cant call the MapResource expression since I am trying to call it from inside another expression. I have managed to get around this by replacing MapResource with u  new ModResource, then using the ExpressionVisitor to find this placeholder node and replace it with the MapResource expression. p  pI also have similar issues when I try to assign a property of ModUser with an expression involving a single property, i.e. UserResource  MapResource. I have managed to get around this second issue by manually combining the expressions required using the methods on the Expression class.p  pI do realise that I could change the code above to p  precodeUserResources  u.Resourcesr gt MapResource.Compile.Invoker codepre  pBut then the final SQL query produced will need to obtain all the attributes of r, not just the ones needed by MapResouce, since we are now dealing with a function. Also, should MapResouce require access to further tables on r it wont be possible since it is being used as a function not an expression. I could set DeferredLoadingEnabled to true but that would spawn off a multitude of individual queries rather than modifying the main query to join with whatever tables are required.p  pDoes anyone know if these operations are going to become easier in future versions of .NET or am I going about this the wrong way I really like the Linq and Expression features, I just wish I could employ them using more readable code.p  pstrongUpdatedstrongp  pThought I might add some examples of how I have made the expressions more composable. They arent concise, but they get the job done.p  precodepublic ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt MapUser      get          ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt mapUser  u gt new ModUser              UserId  u.UserId,             UserResources  u.Resourcesr gt new ModResource                  return mapUser.MapResourcesthis        public ExpressionltFuncltResource, ModResourcegtgt MapResource  ...    public static ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1gtgt MapResourcesltT0, T1gtthis ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1gtgt exp, DataContext dc      return exp.VisitltMethodCallExpression, ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1gtgtgtm gt          ifm.Arguments.Count gt 1 ampamp m.Arguments[1].Type  typeofFuncltDataContext.Resource, ModResourcegt  Find a select statement that has the sub expression as an argument             The resource mapping expression will require the Resource object, which is obtained here             ParameterExpression resourceParam   LambdaExpressionm.Arguments[1].Parameters[0]             return Expression.Callm.Method, m.Arguments[0], The first argument is the record selection for the select method                 Expression.LambdaltFuncltDataContext.Resource, ModResourcegtgtProvide the proper mapping expression as the projection for the select method                      Expression.Invokedc.MapResource, resourceParam,                      resourceParam                                   return m       codepre  pSo what am I doing here Note that in this version of MapUser I dont create the ModResource object correctly, I just create a dummy version. I then call an expression visitor method that looks for the dummy call and replaces it with the one I originally wanted in there. To me it seems like the expression syntax is lacking as I am able to essentially construct the expression tree I originally wanted, but I have to actually vist the tree to do it. Below is another workaround Ive found that deals with the singular casep  precodepublic ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModUsergtgt MapUser      get          ExpressionltFuncltUser, ModResource, ModUsergtgt mapUser  u, resource gt new ModUser              UserId  u.UserId,             UserResource  resource                   return mapUser.CollapseArgumentMapResource, user gt user.MainResource        public ExpressionltFuncltResource, ModResourcegtgt MapResource  ...   public static ExpressionltFuncltT0, T3gtgt CollapseArgumentltT0, T1, T2, T3gtthis ExpressionltFuncltT0, T1, T3gtgt exp, ExpressionltFuncltT2, T1gtgt exp0, ExpressionltFuncltT0, T2gtgt exp1      var param0  Expression.ParametertypeofT0, p0     var argExp  Expression.Invokeexp0, Expression.Invokeexp1, param0     return Expression.LambdaltFuncltT0, T3gtgt          Expression.Invokeexp, param0, argExp,          param0  codepre  pIn this second example I know that I can obtain the Resource data from the User data but I cant inline an expression to show how to do this and map the Resource data to a resource POCO. But I can manually create an expression tree that is given an already mapped resource POCO and use it. I can then create another expression that shows how to obtain the resource raw data from the user and a final expression that shows how to map the raw resource data into a resource POCO. It is now conceivable that I can combine all of this information into a single expression tree in a way that collapses out the resource specific parameter since I can obtain it from the primary user parameter. This is what the code above does.p  pSo Ive found ways to make expressions highly composable... It just doesnt feel clean.p

I believe its usually related to a linq statement referencing something with no elements but am not sure where the error is occurring or why. But am also wondering why this error appears to be being caught and not displayed look good old fashioned exceptions  p  pSo not sure if its an updatepanel issue or a scriptmanager related quirk.  I imagine Im using the wrong keywords to google as I cant find anyone else really complaining about the same thing  p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 22606 ol liIf a method fails to do what it says it will do e.g. if codeSendEmailcode fails to send an email, it should throw an exception.

And since we have a lot of content that will have to be imported, the ability of either CMS to facilitate this will be a major factor in the decision.p  pId like to know if anyone has any experience trying to import a lot of content into either Umbraco or Sharepoint, or if you have any idea how I might go about doing that. Is it easy for either Are there plugins I can find, or scripts I can write Or will I pretty much have to import each existing file manually with either CMSp  pIf you have experience with Umbraco or Sharepoint and have any ideas about this, I would value your input andor recommendations.p

Negative 22606 pEvery single example of jsGrid usage that Ive foundseen shows data being loaded through an Ajax request. Id like to load the grid based on data thats already available a separate request is completely unnecessary unless its a technical requirement.p  pId really like my controller to pull the data required for display in the grid, pass it along to my view and let jqGrid do its thing based on that local data rather than initiating another request.

Negative 22606 pIm working on an installer for our application. The installer makes some changes to the HKEYCURRENTUSERSoftwareCompanyAppName registry key, which the application then looks for the first time it runs. The application then does different things based on the registry keys it finds.p  pThis works great, until you try to install the application as a user account i.e. nonadministrator on windows 7 and maybe Vista, I havent tested that yet.p  pWhen the user tries to install the application, Windows elevates to the administrator accounts credentials. This means that any changes to HKCU in the registry are made to the administrators registry, not the launching users registry. Thus, the keys are not visible to the application when it launches for the first time under the users account.p  pWe cant be the only people whose installer needs to communicate with the app it installs. Is there no way to reliably use the registry to do thisp  pWe cant rely on the user launching the app after he installs it, so passing the information as a commandline parameter isnt a viable solution. The only way I can see to do it is to have the installer invoke a utility as the original user, which gets or sets the registry key itself this seems to be a bit of a silly hoop to have to jump through.p  pEdit The application needs to delete the keys after its used them, so I cant just put them in HKEYLOCALMACHINE.p

Negative 22606 pIm working on a plan of action at my job for migrating our source control from SourceSafe 6.0 ugh to a DVCS like git or Mercurial preferably git ATM.  Right now I am working on the future repository design, i.e. branch layout and how to configure the centralblessed repos.p  pNow, insofar I have only really used git as a means to push hobby open source code to a hrefhttpsgithub.com relnofollowGitHuba and more recently for keeping my own private repo at work so that I have more finegrained control over my code revisions than SourceSafe allows.  Unfortunately I have yet to experience a wide gamut of branchingmerging scenarios or other semicomplex git usage in my repos besides using simple feature branches.  In other words, I dont have a lot of overall experience with DVCS, so I dont think I can predict the typical workflow we will use here and therefore am unable to create a matching repository design on my own.p  pSo instead, I have spent a lot of time reading other peoples git workflows and trying to best apply those strategies to how we release code at my job.  I figure its a place to start anyway, and we can change it as we go along.p  pNow, after looking at many git workflows, I am really liking a particular one a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodel relnofollowoutlined by Vincent Driessena, which seems to have a very clean branch layout that is a nearfit for how we do deployments at work or should, anywayp  h2Separate DevStable Using Branchesh2  hr  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPJQaE.png altSeparate DevStable Using Branchesp  pHowever, I admit to being a little confused after seeing a little different example on a hrefhttphginit.com05.html relnofollowJoel Spolskys HgInit sitea, which seems to focus more on separate repositories rather than branches for separating dev and stable codep  h2Separate DevStable Using Reposh2  hr  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comma1TX.png altSeparate DevStable Using Reposp  h2Questionsh2  hr  pIs this repositoryfocused separation layer simply a Mercurial thing that isnt used much with git  If not, then what are the advantagesdisadvantages to using this method over the use of branches for separating devstable code  Or am I simply completely misunderstanding what is going on here p  pAny input would be appreciated I apologize in advance if this question is a waste of time due to my being steeped in ignorance.p

Negative 22606 pI work in an development group in an enterprise, where we strive to seperate business units and their responsibilities.  So for example, I am in the development group and we are responsible for all tasks related to developing applications.  We have other roles such as dbas, or operational roles that are outside of our group and are responsible for things like deployment, server maintenance, etc.  p  pIm looking at features in VS such as the publish web app feature and the web.config transform feature and reading about them in blogs and various other places.  Based on the majority of what I read it always seems that the writer is assuming that the developer is managing things like connection strings, user names, passwords for the different environments in web config transforms, then publishing to a remove server in some kind of production environment be it live, or test or staging, etc.p  pAn example is a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20100729vs2010webdeployment.aspx relnofollowherea.  In our environment, and I assume others too, the scenario is somewhat more complex than is usually portrayed.  The development group may not know where any of what theyve developed is deployed.  And administrators may move servers,databases etc and update configuration as characteristics of the environment dictate.  So in these cases, how does web.config transforms help  Publish can still potentially be used locally to build artifacts for a deployment package but even youd probably want to use some automated build manager instead.p  pSo is publish and transforms really more suited for more rudimentary development processes where the barrier between development and operations is very grey  Or am I missing something  It just seems that a lot of things Ive reading about this kind of thing have good intentions but are somewhat superficial in the context of a more defined development process.p  pInterested to know others opinions and experiences on this. p

I assumed that that meant a directory returned by codeURLForDirectoryinDomainappropriateForURLcreateerrorcode using codeNSItemReplacementDirectorycode as the search path.p  pThat didnt work either  I ended up falling back to implementing the replacement logic using separate operations, but this is nonatomic and unsafe and all that bad stuff.p  pDoes anyone have a working snippet of code that runs on iOS that either return YES from a call to codereplaceItemAtURLcode or actually puts error information into the error pointerp  pAny help much appreciated.p  pEDIT  Test code included below.

Negative 22606 pHey all, I have two databases. One with 145000 rows and approx. 12 columns. I have another database with around 40000 rows and 5 columns. I am trying to compare based on two columns values. For example if in CSV1 column 1 says 100199 and column two says Main Stmeaning that this row is contained within the 100 block of main street, how would I go about comparing that with a similar two columns in CSV2. I need to compare every row in CSV1 to each single row in CSV2. If there is a match I need to append the 5 columns of each matching row to the end of the row of CSV2. Thus CSV2s number of columns will grow significantly and have repeat entries, doesnt matter how the columns are ordered. Any advice on how to compare two columns with another two columns in a separate database and then iterate across all rows. Ive been using python and the import csv so far with the rest of the work, but this part of the problem has me stumped. p  pThanks in advance Johnp

Its also data heavy  lots of files, images, audio, messaging, personal news feed etc.p  pI like the look on strongmongodbstrong a lot, I like the way it works, and I like how it scales  but cant get my head around how this would work for a site such as I describe. Would all interactions for a specific user have to be stored in a single documentp  pI am however very comfortable using strongmysqlstrong and like the relational aspect of it. I am just worried without a lot of work there will be scalability issues with this project  although perhaps with memcached and sharding this wont be an issuep  pId like to know from those with experience with the two databases on large projects, out of strongmysqlstrong and strongmongodbstrong which is the right tool for this particular jobp

Negative 22606 pProblem I have a simple QStringListModel that I want to display in a view.  However, I want each item in the view to be a custom QWidget that I have created.  I do not understand why this is such a difficult problem  I have scoured the internet for solutions and, although I find bits and pieces here and there, no good solution fits all my needs.p  pThe basic code for setting up my modelviewp  pre code QStringList strings  add some strings to the model  QStringListModel model  new QStringListModelstrings QListView view  new QListView  viewsetModelmodel  code pre  pI have tried various attempts at doing this to no avail.p  pbAttempt 1bp  pI tried subclassing a new QItemDelegate object.  Inside this object, I overrode the methods for creating an editor.  I followed all the steps for setting up that delegate.  The problem is that when the view is populated with the model, it grabs each item in the model in QtDisplayRole when I need it to grab each item in QtEditRole.p  pbAttempt 2bp  pAnother method I tried was to subclass a QListView, and override the setModel method to call setIndexWidget for each item in the model.  My code looks something thisp  pre code void CustomListViewsetModelQAbstractItemModel model      QListViewsetModelmodel      for int i  0 i rowCount i              QModelIndex index  modelindexi, 0          CustomWidget widget  new CustomWidget         setIndexWidgetindex, widget       code pre  pThis worked as far as adding my CustomWidget object to each row in the list view.  In order to ensure that the regular model data was not also shown beneath my CustomWidget objects, I also overrode CustomListViewpaintEventQPaintEvent event to do nothing.  Again, this worked.  p  pBut my major issue now is that when the list is displayed, although my CustomWidgets are displayed on it properly, the background of the list is a solid white color.  I tried calling setAutoFillBackgroundfalse on the CustomListView but that did nothing. I want my list view to have a transparent background.p  pAny feedback on this problem would be igreatlyi appreciated.  I have spent a lot of time trying to get this to work  Thanksp

Negative 22606 pfirst question here. I am trying to learn python by stepping through project euler, and Ive run into a roadblock. The following method returns a list of prime factors works fine for a single callp  precodedef findPrimeFactorsnum, primeFactors  []     Find the prime factors of an arbitrary positive integer          input num to factorize         returns a list containing the prime factors of the number          pIndex  2      while num gt pIndex         if num  pIndex  0             num  pIndex             primeFactors.appendpIndex             return FindPrimes.findPrimeFactorsnum, primeFactors          else             pIndex  1      return primeFactors codepre  pHowever when I use it in a loop, like so this method may not be complete yet, currently results in infinite loop since more primes cannot be foundp  precodedef countPrimesn  1001     find n amount of unique primes ascending          input number of primes to find         returns list of n primes starting from 2         primes  []     i  2      while lenprimes lt n         primeFactors  FindPrimes.findPrimeFactorsi         printprimeFactors verify method behavior          if lenprimeFactors is 1             primes.appendprimeFactors[0]            i  1      return primes codepre  pThe result is that the first loop returns [2], the next returns [2, 3], and so on, appending the new results to the list that I Wanted to have been empty on the first recursive call. It seems that my list is persisting, but Im not sure exactly why I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3153017pythonclassscopelistsPython Class scope amp listsa as well which gives me some clues but the recursion complicates it more.p  pRecursive also means I cannot simply assign an empty set to it either.

The problem is that the array contains duplicates and I dont want duplicates in the presentation on the homepage.p  pI have googled like a freak and I have found out that the way to remove duplicates is to convert the array to a set, since a set cant contain duplicates. Fair enough. I have checked different pages describing how to go about it but I dont understand p  pIts probably very simple but from what I can make of it the sets contain strings and that wont do it for me as my items have a lot of data attached to them item.name, item.type etc.p  pThe code I use isp  precodeltcforEach itemsresults.searchResults varfoundItem varStatusstatusgt     ltcset varcurItem valuefoundItem.item gt     lt get item details gt     ltxmlfeedgetItemXML itemcurItem gt ltcforEachgt codepre  pAnd what I want to do is make sure that all curItems are unique.

Negative 22606 pWhen developing my website at a hrefhttpfilmblurb.org relnofollowhttpfilmblurb.orga, Im having trouble with my footer.

In each of the 63 cases all eight tests worked correctly.p  pSecond, the HTMLFormElement necessitates this works because it retrieves in its elements using shorthand notation.  If codeltinput nametypeof valuescalar gtcode is an element of a form, then codeform.typeofcode  scalar.p  pFrom my experience, reserved words are usually data inflicted eg, a column named private, not program inflicted.  As such they contaminate JSON objects, and from there INPUT, and from there the HTMLFormElement.  Simply put, without a huge amount of imho unnecessary work, its impossible to keep reserved words emnotem being forced to work correctly in shorthand.p  pIt seems to me these real problemsp  ul lipcare needs to be taken not to conflict with existent strongpropertiesstrong, not reserved wordspli lipmany if not all strongvariablesstrong cannot be reserved wordspli lipuse of reserved words as properties can be but are not necessarily confusingpli ul  pIs this conclusion correct then, that reserved words as property names, and accessing them either as strings or shorthand, is just fine  as long as a little common sense is applied to the situationp

Negative 22606 pAs a consultant, I am responsible for designing the architecture of an application for an external company. The requirements for this application are rather simple and the whole thing could easily be solved with a basic web application, one or two incoming web services and a few outgoing document channels.p  pThings get more complicated because of two nonfunctional requirementsp  ol liSaid company mandates that all internal applications be offered through an enterprise portal for UI, security and technical uniformityli liSaid company mandates that all applications be built using SOA principles so that services may be eventually published on an ESB and reused.li ol  pArchitecture can be adapted to the portal requirement easily. Presentation will be built using portlets and integrate within the portal theme, and portal security will be reused. No big deal.p  pThe SOA requirement is another story. Reusable services have not yet been identified. The way I see it, there are a few optionsp  ol liBusiness logic is deployed on the portal and colocated with the presentation layer. No services are exposed and this decision is deferred.li liBusiness logic is deployed on a separate server. An API is designed and all services are exposed using a closed protocol e.g. RMI or Hessian. For services that need to be eventually reused, a SOAP API may be added on top of these services.li liBusiness logic is deployed on a separate server. A SOAP API is designed and all services are exposed using this mechanism.li ol  pI want to avoid building something too complicated. I have lived through projects with business delegates, remote facades and DTOs where every single change required modifying several layers. Yet, it feels as if this SOA requirement forcibly pushes me in that direction.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The more I think about it, the more I realize that complexity arises from the need to design a remoting API. Of course this requires creating interfaces for services, but what about the exchanged entities Either I go the DTO way and end up with two parallels object hierarchies one for DTOs and one for the actual entities or I go the interface way and declare interfaces for all entities that need to transit across servers. Either way, this brings up a whole new set of problems and we will end up writing lots of boilerplate code. And I thought we were through with that era...p  pWhat would be the best or least worse way to design thisp  pThanks all.p

A click in an entry loads another HTML page in the right frame and should also update the hash in the location of the browser window so the user can bookmark pages.p  pHow can I make this workp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN        httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtLeftlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt  ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8gt   function go        window.document.writefoo   replace document with foo     window.parent.location.hash  foo    ltscriptgt  lth1gtLeftlth1gt ltpgt   lta href onclickjavascriptgo return falsegtGoltagt ltpgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 22606 pI have a custom drawn Path control with some texblocks inside making up a DataTemplate in Silverlight 4. I used the Animation window in Expression Blend to create a simple animation that I can play and see work OK within Blend.p  pI want this animation to fire off on the MouseEnter event VB.NET I want to issue a .Begin method on the animation. Seems straight forward enough.p  pHowever at runtime nothing happens. I place a breakpoint on the MouseEnter event and surely enough it goes into the event upon the mouse entering the control, it runs the line of code to begin animation but nothing happens. No exception, no animation, nothing.p  pCan anyone tell me what I am missing here since I know the actual animation emdoesem work, it just is not running at runtime XAML and event are below removed some styling properties on Texblocks, etc. to make easier to readp  precode    ltDataTemplate xKeyMyItemTemplategt         ltGrid Width50  Height80 Opacity0.9             RenderTransformOrigin0.5,0.5              ToolTipService.ToolTipBinding ItemNamegt                          ltGrid.Resourcesgt                 ltStoryboard xNameMyItemTemplateAnimategt                     ltDoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames Storyboard.TargetPropertyShape.Fill.GradientBrush.GradientStops[4].GradientStop.Offset                              Storyboard.TargetNamepathgt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime000.3 Value0.296gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime000.4 Value0.384gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime000.5 Value0.475gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime000.6 Value0.529gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime000.7 Value0.587gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime000.8 Value0.652gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime000.9 Value0.582gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime001 Value0.523gt                                 ltEasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime001.1 Value0.5gt                     DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFramesgt                 ltStoryboardgt             ltGrid.Resourcesgt              ltGrid.RenderTransformgt                 ltCompositeTransform Rotation180gt             ltGrid.RenderTransformgt              ltPath xNamepath DataM 0,0 L 50,0 50,50 25,80 0,50 0,0 StrokeWheat StrokeThickness2gt                 ltPath.Fillgt                     ltLinearGradientBrush EndPoint0.419,0.662 MappingModeRelativeToBoundingBox StartPoint1.051,0.137gt                         ltGradientStop ColorFF250A0A Offset1gt                         ltGradientStop ColorFF250A0Agt                         ltGradientStop ColorFF501616 Offset0.725gt                         ltGradientStop ColorFF501616 Offset0.275gt                         ltGradientStop ColorFF9F4C4C Offset0.5gt                     ltLinearGradientBrushgt                 ltPath.Fillgt             ltPathgt              ltTextBlock xNameTextBlock1                                           ltTextBlockgt             ltTextBlock xNameTextBlock2             ltTextBlockgt                                             ltGridgt      ltDataTemplategt codepre  pThe code that uses the DataTemplatep  precodeltmMapItemsControl xNameMyItems ItemTemplateStaticResource MyItemTemplategt codepre  pAnd here is the VB.NET eventp  precodePrivate Sub MyItemsMouseEntersender As Object, e As System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs Handles MyItems.MouseEnter                          MyItemTemplateAnimate.Begin End Sub codepre

Negative 22606 pI have a situation where a user is attaching files within an application, these files are then persisted to Azure Blob storage, there is a reasonable likelihood that there are going to be duplicates and I want to put in place a solution where duplicate blobs are avoided.p  pMy first thought is to just name the blob as filenamehash but that only captures a subset of duplicates, then filesizehash was then next thought.p  pIn doing this though it seems like I am losing some of the flexibility of the blob storage to represent the position in a hierarchy of the file, see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2619007windowsazurehowtocreatesubdirectoryinablobcontainerWindows Azure How to create sub directory in a blob containerap  pSo I was looking to see if there was a way to create a blob that referenced the blob data i.e. some for of symbolic link but couldnt find what I wanted.p  pAm I missing something or should I just go with filesizehash method and store my hierarchy using an alternative method.p

Negative 22606 pAs most of you know, .Net framework 4.0Visual Studio 2010 supports implicit line continuation in VB, which was not available in previous versions at least not to my knowledge. p  pI have a situation where I am working on an ASP.Net 3.5 application that is targeting a machine that does not currently have .Net 4.0 installed and from what I understand it wont be installed for some time yet on that machine. Obviously, my development machine does have .net 4.0 installed.p  pWith the implicit line continuation feature in VS2010, I sometimes find myself forgetting to add the continuation, and VS2010 does not have an issue with that even when I am targeting a previous version. Additionally, I know that if I actually compile the code business objects and such, issues with line continuation are not a problem, as the compiled dll works fine as a 3.5 .net file.p  pMy concern is this. There are areas where I am doing VB.Net coding in the code behindbeside for the asp.net pages. These would only be compiled on the server when they are first used, but since the server doesnt have the .net 4.0 framework or even if it did, does anyone know if this would this cause the compilation to fail if I missed a line continuation If so, is there a way to enforce using line continuation characters in VS2010p  pI realize that some best practices might not be getting followed here, but Im not about to change all the development dynamics around here just yet. Also, Im not in an environment where I could easily test this out on my own.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 22606 pOkay my initial problem was to move an element from left to right. My framework of choice, is jQuery so I used animate.p  pHere is a simple example. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net7NYwY3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net7NYwY3ap  pIn firefox, there is about 3 pauses at the same place during the animation.

Negative 22606 pIm trying to override a specific function in kernel32.dll. Is it somehow possible to redefine that function in a static library and force the executable to use the one in the static library I guess the different linkage could become a problem.p  pIt would be possible to override it with my own custom DLL. However the problem is that the DLL itself needs to link to kernel32.dll, so it ignores my definition of that function.p  pEDIT I got it working with my own DLL.

If I include an image beneath my header a hrefhttpwww.reversl.netbefore relnofollowhttpwww.reversl.netbeforea everything sits exactly where I want. But if I remove the image my header gives itself a margin from the top of the page as shown here a hrefhttpwww.reversl.netafter relnofollowhttpwww.reversl.netaftera Im guessing its related to my floated header and its floated contents not being cleared. But Ive included the clearfix hack and that doesnt seem to have changed things.

Negative 22606 pI have an embedded Youtube video, and I want to capture events when the user pauses the video, skips around, etc. Following the examples at Googles documentation httpdevelopers.google.comyoutubejsapireference, I do the followingp  precodevar video  my video ID here var params   allowScriptAccess always  var atts   id youtubeplayer  var x  854 var y  480 swfobject.embedSWFhttpwww.youtube.comv  video  enablejsapi1ampplayerapiidytplayerampversion3, bobina, x, y, 8, null, null, params, atts  function onYouTubePlayerReadyplayerId        youtubeplayer  document.getElementByIdyoutubeplayer       youtubeplayer.addEventListeneronStateChange, onytplayerStateChange       youtubeplayer.setPlaybackQualitylarge         function onytplayerStateChangenewState      Make it autoplay on page load     if newState  1          youtubeplayer.playVideo               var tiempoyoutubeplayer.getCurrentTime     Rounds to 2 decimals     var tiempo  Math.roundtiempo100100     alerttiempo      codepre  pNow, all this works perfectly in Firefox and Safari, but theres no way to make it work in IE8 by which I mean the video loads, but events arent captured the event handler never gets called. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2885500javascriptaddeventlisteneronstatechangenotworkinginiejavascript addEventListener onStateChange not working in IEa , IE doesnt support addEventListener, so I tried replacing that line withp  precodeyoutubeplayer.attachEventonStateChange, onytplayerStateChange codepre  pBut it doesnt work either. The author of that question says that he finally solved it by putting onComplete in my colorbox and put the swfobject in that, but Im not using a colorbox here I dont even know what that is, so I dont understand what he means.p  pUsing alerts to debug, I see that the first function onYoutubePlayerReady is indeed called, but I cant even tell whether the event listener isnt being registered or whether its the getElementById that isnt working I tried debugging by adding ap  precodealerttypeof youtubeplayer codepre  pRight after it, but it doesnt even pop up.p  pOh, and one more thing the video starts automatically in Firefox and Safari, but in IE it doesnt either. And yes, Im running this on a server, not on a local page.p  pAnyone has any ideas I dont really know what else to try.p
Negative 22606 pI have the following problemsp  p1. I want to use a contenditable div or a textarea  preferrably a contenteditable div because I can also use there html tags, not just text , as a writing pad. However I want the writing to STOP once the cursor reaches the BOTTOM RIGHT corner of the divtextarea. This seems hard to implement. I have managed with maxheight and overflowhidden to make the element  div  textarea  to not expand, however the user can still type, it will just be invisible, something unwanted. What I want is the writing to stop when the cursor reaches the bottom right corner and then go on, on a new empty page.p  pMy first idea was to use some monospace font and calculate the max chars allowed but the issue is that 1st not all browsers show the same number of monospace characters of the same font, per line and 2nd the div can be variable in size, not constant.p  pThe ideal would be a div so that i can enter html tags  bold, italic, etc.  and the div that shows the content can be of a different size, depending on the screen resolution. p  p2. Given a div which represents a page which gets filled with a texthtml from the database, how can I show only the content that fills the div, and when the user presses a next page button, show the next content. This seems undoable to me, figuring out via javascript how much content can fill into the div.p  pAny ideas on these two correlated problems would be greatly appreciatedp  pNo flash, no java, no plugins. only html,css,javascriptp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 22606 pPlease pardon me if this question has been already asked before ...p  pI would like to create a clientserver application preferrably using Java which requires the client program to invoke certain controller in the server program to encapsulate a single class originally resides in the server and deliver to the client side. The client will then decapsulate the class and create a new class object and perform certain task.p  pHowever, I am not sure how it would be possible to encapsulate a whole class in the server side and transfer back to the client side for object creattion, instantiation and perform required tasks.p  pFor example, similar kind of application may be like client side JavaScript or Flash program execution for server side code. But I am not sure either JavaScript or Flash programs are operating like this way or not.p  pPlease suggest me the possible ways of writing such kind of app in a very simplistic way to express this conceptidea or any possible linksexamples to get a grip into.p  pThanks a tlo...p

Negative 22606 pSo I am only a few days into learning about wcf services, specifically duplex, and I am starting with a test app.  The goal is to have a Service that has an internal static class which stores variables, and a Client that fetches for those variables.  p  pCurrently I have two variables in the Storage class, one which is a list of Subscribers codeObservableCollectionltIMyContractCallBackgtcode and one which is an codeObservableCollectionltstringgtcode, where each string gets sent in the callback method to the client.  p  pI would like to be able to have the client codeFetchcode which first Subscribes if not already, by adding its context to the collection on the server side the strings in the collection on the server side.  That part works as expected.  However, I would also like to codePushcode a string from the server to every client in the subscription list, as well as codeAddcode strings to the collection of strings.  Thats where my issues crop up.  p  pAnytime I codeFetchcode, it adds to string list test1... and test2... and sends them, then the client updates a textblock UI wpa so if I fetch twice Ill have codetest1...,test2...,test1...,test2...code because right now theres no checking for duplicates.  That proves that the collection can get updated and remembered on the server side from codeFetchcode to codeFetchcode. However, when I try to codeAddcode or codeSendcode a given text, all variables are forgotten, so the subscriber list is null, and the listtoaddto is empty.  Yet when I then codeFetchcode again, the old list is back now with 6 things, codetest1...,test2... etc...codep  pI have this before the classp  precode[ServiceBehaviorInstanceContextMode InstanceContextMode.PerSession, ConcurrencyMode  ConcurrencyMode.Single] codepre  pand I also tried a Singleton context mode to no avail.

Negative 22606 pI am making my first gui in C and I have watchedread a ton of tutorials about WPF and MVVMthats the approach Im using, but I am stuck on something that intuitively should be rather simple to accomplish. I have a listbox, and above it I would like to display a textblock or label that would say Please select item from list and then disappear once an item is selected. p  pHow can I accomplish this Would it require writing in the codebehind Most tutorials I have read discourage ever using the codebehind so I would prefer a different solution.

It can read domaincategory, domaincategorythisarticleaboutx, all redirecting to domainindex.php and working well.p  pHowever, I quickly learned that whenever I used a relative path such as .include, the relative path was taking in account the current URL, and not the actual url where the php file is at.p  pI have 2 questions that I couldnt answer when browsing the internet for a long timep  p1 If domainindex.php is trying to show an image with .thumbnailsscienceimage.jpg, it wont work if the actual url is domaincategory, but it WILL work if its just domaincategoryno slash at the end. Why this inconsistency The HTML code is showing the src to the image is the same on both cases.p  p2 My header has a dropdown menu with categories. Once its submitted, it will call itself header.php, see which category the user chose and redirect to domaincategory. All works well. You can then rechange the dropdown menu to another category and everything loads again. But again, if you access directly domaincateory with the slash at the end, the CSS wont load, the images wont load as said on question 1, and submitting the form will cause a problem because it will look for header.php on domaincategory, and not just on domain where the header.php file actually is.p  pI have successfully used dirnamestrongFILEstrong to make sure my includes all work as far as my testing has gone, no errors. But I could not use dirnamestrongFILEstrong to generate links or images img src that will always point to the images regardless of the URL. p  pOn localhost, the HTML is coming as img srccpathhtdocsthumbnailsimg, which is right, but the image does not display anyway. Same with the a href links. Trying to create links with dirnamestrongFILEstrong created links on localhost as ccorrectpath, but clicking on them did absolutely nothing. Also, using header with dirnamestrongFILEstrong to handle the redirection from the dropdown menu caused it to cease working as well but if I used . . dropDownMenuValue, it would again correctly change the url to domaincategoryChosenp  pHow can I use a consistent method for relative urls that allow me to work on localhost and then upload to my web host without the need make changes to the files, AND that works with dynamic websites that have pretty name urls through htaccessp  pThank you,p  pThis is all very puzzling for me how getting a relative path from the current file path is being so hard and generating so many different issues, and why only include statements seem to work well with dirnamestrongFILEstrongp  pEdit a hrefhttpboard.phpbuilder.comshowthread.php10374336RESOLVEDmodrewriteforSEOFriendlyURLsandrelativepathissuefixes relnofollowhttpboard.phpbuilder.comshowthread.php10374336RESOLVEDmodrewriteforSEOFriendlyURLsandrelativepathissuefixesap  pIve found this on other sites, but it requires you to change the base everytime you want to go from localhost to the web.

Negative 22606 pTake the scenario where you have the following applicationp  ul liAn MVC 4 Web Appli liThe application talks to an existing database via Entity Framework 5 with no plans to change to another ORM or database platform.li liThe application talks to an external SOAP Web Service the webservice may change to WCF.li ul  pWould youp  ol lipCreate a generic repository for all the EF entities e.g. MyDBRepository, and a repository for the SOAP Web Services calls E.g.

Then have the repositories injected into the service class, and finally the service class injected into the MVC controller.pli lipOr would you have one service class that handles the db queries and business logic using the EF generated DBContext and the generated table entities  e.g. MyDBService, and another service class that handles the business logic and SOAP web service calls e.g. MySOAPWebService.

Negative 22606 pIm currently hosted on a virtual dedicated server from GoDaddy. I know, I know, but its inexpensive and Im poor. I switched to it from shared hosting a couple months ago. It recently came to my attention that my onsite contact form isnt working, and then I realized that various emails I should have received from my phpBB forum never reached me either. Long and short of it is, Im no longer receiving emails sent to memydomain.com from any script on my server.p  pI have several different scripts that should be sending automatic emails to me including phpBB and the contact form that I coded myself and none are working. All are written in PHP.p  pI did a lot of testing, and Ive confirmed that I can send emails to other email addresses using scripts. If I write a script that sends emails to my Gmail account, my Yahoo account, and two different accounts at my domain, the Gmail and Yahoo emails go through and the other two just disappear. They arent going into spamI checked. p  pAlso, I can upload the exact same file to another domain I own this one still on shared hosting and it sends all four emails properly, to Gmail, Yahoo, and the two accounts on my domain. p  pIt appears that its the combination of a script on mydomain.com sending email to anyaddressmydomain.com that is causing the problem, and it appears that those emails are simply evaporating. p  pOne other piece of information When I switched to the virtual dedicated server, I left my email asis through GoDaddys email service, so they arent actually mapped to the same IP as my domain. GoDaddy staff said that would be fine and I am still able to receive other email at those addresses. p  pIm not particularly knowledgeable about email, but my tentative guess is that perhaps GoDaddy employs some sort of shortcut for email coming from a script within a domain that is going to an email address for that domain, and that shortcut is simply losing the email since the email address isnt actually based in the same server. p  pHelp p  pstrongUpdate 103012 In fairness to GoDaddy, it is worth noting that they got this fixed for me the day after I emailed them about it.strongp

A Redhat guest on the same VM stays lock step with other computers that use the same domain time server.  Ive looked around and found people recommending both using the VMWare synch tool and others suggesting using the guest Windows synch tool.  Drift this large seems rediculous and is causing issues with software running on various machines.p  pWhat Im asking is, does anyone know what could be causing this and what I might do to mitigate it  I have a suspicion that VMWare is slewing the clock somehow, but the fact that a different guest OS isnt experiencing it makes me doubt that suspicion.p  pThanks.p

Negative 22606 pAs part of updating the toolchain for a legacy codebase, we would like to move from the Borland C 5.02 compiler to the Microsoft compiler VS2008 or later.

What I dont understand is why the compiler allocates additional space for each possible case in the switch. It seems that space for one temporary would be sufficient. This is, in fact, how gcc handles the same code.  Borland, on the other hand, appears to use RVO, passing the pointer all the way down and avoiding use of a temporary. The MS C compiler is the only one of the three that reserves space for each case in the switch.p  pI know that its difficult to suggest refactoring options when you dont know which portions of the test code can change  thats why my first question is emwhyem does the compiler behave this way emin the test caseem. Im hoping that if I can understand that, I can choose the best refactoringpragmacommandline option to fix it.p

What is the reason for the relative directories being interpreted in different ways I would not like to have two separate scripts for running in Pythonshell.p  pThe original python script is in the directory codeblahblahDEMOdemo.pycode, and the the shell script that runs it is in codeblahblahDEMOdemoautotestautotestlogger.shcodep  pI have confirmed that this problem occurs for any script I try to run. I shouldnt have to change the original Python code to make it work with the shell script. I already accounted for it in the shell script, and it successfully runs the file. p  pThanks.p
Negative 22606 pIm working with a very large project that usesp  ol liLegacy JSP pages that includes javascript files with script tagsli liBackbone models and views that uses other javascript modules without RequireJSli ol  pWe now want to start using RequireJS with jQuery, BackboneJS and UnderscoreJS for everything we develop from now on, but we dont have the resources to rewrite all the legacy JSP pages. We may have time to rewrite the Backbone models and views we have already developed.p  pThe problem is that for our legacy code both 1 and 2 above we include all our javascript files in a huge file and ship to the browsers. This huge file must be able to coexist with our new RequireJS templates, but how can I e.g. separate certain parts of the huge file, so I can use them with the templates using RequireJS Without having to rewrite all pages that uses this part of the file, or having duplicate code.p  pThanksp

Because events are under Window, the instance needed to be passed to an anonymous function along with the i value. p  pThis therefore assigns a very unique function to the event, and because the delete method will be destroying the element containing the listener I would like to remove it first from what Ive read it could cause leaks otherwise.

Negative 22606 pI am having some trouble understanding how pointers work in a particular situation.

know that buffer is really an array of pointers, which in this case are just three consecutive memory addresses that contain the addresses of the first element of three consecutive byte arrays that are not null terminated.p  pI visualize this as literally 24 memory addresses in a row containing the binary values of ABCDEFGHijklmnopQRSTUVWX without a 0 at the end.p  pThe address of buffer[0] points to an address that points to A, the address of buffer[1] points to an address that points to i, the address of buffer[2] points to an address that points to Q.p  pI see the fread to ampbuffer[1] as reading the 8 bytes into the location at the address stored in buffer[1].p  pI have tried various attempts at this fread using ampbuffer1, buffer1, buffer1 and so on, but most have given me segmentation faults ampbuffer[1] seems to almost do what I want.p  pAttempting to do a printfbuffer[1] as s is sn, buffer[1] near the end before fclose I get a segmentation fault.p  pI am

Negative 22606 pI have recently downloaded the latest version of the spring framework springframework4.0.0.M1dist.zipsha1, but I only wanted the JDBC libraries that came with it, which consisted of 3 jars, as far as I could tell. I have tried to include these jars in my project in Eclipse by configuring my build path for them. Whenever I do this, and try to extend a class from one of these libraries, it says it is unrecognized, and as a solution, to import the appropriate package okay, fine. So I import it, and it still throws me an error saying The type org.springframework.dao.support.DaoSupport cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files whenever I hover over the class being extended.p  pI would provide a screenshot, but I need to have at least a 10 reputation, and I am new to this website, so I apologize.p  pI have tried using the default unzipping tool which is already on Windows 7, I have used 7Zip, and have tried to include external jars without creating a folder in Eclipse to place the jars in, and I have tried to make a folder and include them, and have also tried deleting and redownloading the entire spring framework. Still the same error.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

The codetouchmovecode listening event in particular caught my attention, and I figured I could try and make my script run with itp  precodedocument.ontouchmove, function         stickySubnav       codepre  pWhat this does is run the script when the user scrolls emwhile keeping their finger on the screenem. It doesnt work when they launch the scroll with inertia, but still, it is enough to make the effect smoother, as the content of the page makes it so that the user is less likely to scroll quickly. p  pThe problem is running that script this way makes the scrolling a little choppy on older phones. I found that A5class processors can handle it just fine, but anything less powerful wouldnt be able to deal with it while maintaining a perfectly smooth scrolling experience.p  pMy question is is there any way I could tell that script to only run once every X milliseconds, or any other way to make the whole experience less frustratingp  pThanksp

While not an effective solution on a large scale, for the sake of setting up a demo to show people, I want to change the signalling method over from WebSocket to Ajax so that I can show off the WebRTC video chat service I made.p  pTo that end, Ive been trying to code something for the past few days, but have had no success in getting the WebRTC peers to capture each others video.p  pAt the moment, when one client connects to the script, I am using Ajax to send a request to a PHP script that checks whether there are any other active users in the DB. If not, the script then creates an offer, and places the offer in the DB. After that, the client polls a separate PHP script every second to check for an answer from another client connecting to the script.p  pAfter that, I then connect to the script from another client, which queries the same PHP script and DB, which then realizes that an active user the first connection has already posted an offer, which the second client acquires and sets for the remote description. The second client then creates an answer, which is placed in the DB.p  pAt this point, the first client which is polling the DB every second detects that an answer is present and sets that answer as the remote description for the first client. Unfortunately, even after successfully doing all of this, the other clients video isnt popping up.p  pSo heres where Im confused and have three multipart questionsp  p1 I thought that after both clients set their local description and then sent that local description to the other client and the other client set that received description as the remote description that the onaddstream event was supposed to fire, thus allowing me to display the remote video. However, this isnt happening. This worked fine before when I used WebSocket, but its not working at all with pure Ajax. Is there something in particular Im missing Has the WebRTC spec changed radically in the past six months Ive tried looking at the WebRTC specs, but I dont see any major changes.p  p2 After getting frustrated with not getting things to work with Ajax, I went back to my WebSocket version and loaded it on my local host. I havent changed the code at all since last using it which worked fine six months ago, but now, when I try to use it, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt. Sometimes I get errors related to not being able to set the local andor remote descriptions. Whats up with this Have there been changes to the specs that would cause this to happen Related to this, even though I cant get the remote videos to pop up with the Ajax version, I have been echoing a lot of stuff out to the console, and it seems like with the Ajax version as well, sometimes the local and remote descriptions for both clients are successfully set up, and sometimes errors occurs when trying to set the localremote descriptions for whatever reason, even though Im running the exact same script each time without any changes. Im using the latest version of Chrome, and Im starting to wonder if theres a bug it in or something.p  p3 Is the onicecandidate event handler required to establish a connection My assumption was that peers could establish a connection with simply a valid offer and answer, and that the onicecandidate event was use to provide alternate routes, etc., which could lead to a better connection but arent required. Am I wrong If the onicecandidate info is required, how do you recommend I handle this with Ajax as the signalling methodp  pI know thats a lot of info and a lot of questions, but any informationinsight that anyone can offer would be very much appreciated. Ive been banging my head against my desk for the past couple of days trying to figure this out, and nothing is making sense.p

Negative 22606 pForgive me if this question is silly, but Im starting to learn about consistent hashing and after reading Tom White blog post on it a hrefhttpwww.tomewhite.com200711consistenthashing.htmlherea and realizing that most default hash functions are NOT well mixed I had a thought on ensuring that an arbitrary hash function is minimally wellmixed. p  pMy thought is best explained using an example like thisp  precodeBucket 1 11000110 Bucket 2 11001110 Bucket 3 11010110 Bucket 4 11011110 codepre  pUnder a standard hash ring implementation for consistent caching across these buckets, you would be get terribly performance, and nearly every entry would be lumped into Bucket 1. However, if we use bits 4amp5 as the MSBs in each case then these buckets are suddenly excellently mixed, and assigning a new object to a cache becomes trivial and only requires examining 2 bits.p  pIn my mind this concept could very easily be extended when building distributed networks across multiple nodes. In my particular case I would be using this to determine which cache to place a given piece of data into. The increased placement speed isnt a real concern, but ensuring that my caches are wellmixed is and I was considering just choosing a few bits that are optimally mixed for my given caches. Any information later indexed would be indexed on the basis of the same bits.p  pIn my naive mind this is a much simpler solution than introducing virtual nodes or building a better hash function. That said, I cant see any mention of an approach like this and Im concerned that in my hashing ignorance Im doing something wrong here and I might be introducing unintended consequences.p  pIs this approach safe Should I use it Has this approach been used before and are there any established algorithms for determining the minimum unique group of bitsp

Negative 22606 pAfter having some recent issues with codegettextcode, Ive got a couple of questions regarding how it works, and how I can avoid these issues in the future.br My issue was that I was trying to set the locale to codedecode, rather than codedeDEcode, which was not available on the server. My local copy was using the codephpgettextcode package is package the right term, and so was happy using a locale that wasnt on the system. This has spawned 2 questions  p  ol liWhy does the locale code codedeDEcode work, when the directory structure is codelocalesdeLCMESSAGESfile.pocodeli liHow can I check that a locale is installed e.g. If I want to use codedeDE.utf8code, but thats not available so I must fallback to codedeDEcode, or codezhHKcode is unavailable so I want to fallback to codezhCNcode. I know these are edge cases, but Id like to make the code as robust as possible. To clarify, this is if the locale is available on the system as shown using the codelocale acode command, not if the file is available in the system.  li ol  pAlso, whats best practice for making this work on multiple platforms My current code is p  precodelocaleCode  deDE  Example, would be generated putenvLANG . localeCode putenvLANGUAGE . localeCode setlocaleLCALL, localeCode  domain  mydomain  Again, example  Dont load the locale from the cache bindtextdomaindomain, ..localesnocache bindtextdomaindomain, ..locales bindtextdomaincodesetdomain, UTF8  textdomaindomain codepre

Negative 22606 pI wonder if it is possible to use spray to build a response based on the stream, not the array of bytesp  pI would like to get a file from specific URLusing codeSource.fromURLcodeand post it as codeoctetstreamcode to the specific URL e.g. get the file from Nexus and deploy it to Tomcat.p  pcodeHttpEntitycodes buffer method is codeArray[Byte]code, so I can read entire file into memory and build a codePOSTcode request, and it should work just fine for smaller files, though it would consume enormous amounts of memory in case of huge files.p
Negative 22606 pMy goal is to inspect a body of the POST request and compare it to some list of keyvalue pairs on nginx. In my situation POST requests will always be in JSON format. Each request will contain a codekeyvaluecode pair like this codetransaction12345code or codetransaction098765code. Mean the key transaction will always be there and value will change some time.  I was thinking to use a hrefhttpwiki.nginx.orgHttpLuaModule relnofollowluanginxmodulea to inspect a post body and than compare it with keyvalue from lets say codememcachedcode. I dont have any code to show yet, but I will try to update a question, some time soon. I was wondering if someone could help me get started, with this or show how it can be done.p

Negative 22606 pMany Cocoa methods take an optional codeNSError code argument that they use to report errors. Frequently, I find myself using such methods even in circumstances where the only way that an error could occur is through programming error on my part, rather than unexpected runtime conditions. As such, I dont want to write any errorhandling code that will do any uservisible things. All I really want to do upon error is log the error and perhaps crash, while keeping my code as concise and readable as possible.p  pThe trouble is that the keep the code concise and log the error objectives are in tension with each other. I frequently have a choice between these two approaches, both of which I dislikep  pstrong1. Pass NULL for the error pointer argument.strongp  precode[managedObjectContext saveNULL] codepre  ul liAdvantages Succinct, readable, and makes clear that errors are not expected. Perfectly fine as long as I was correct in my belief that an error here is logically impossible.li liDisadvantages If Ive screwed up and an error emdoesem happen, it wont be logged and my debugging will be harder. In some circumstances, I might not even notice the error happened.li ul  pstrong2. Pass an codeNSError code and log the resulting error, with the same boilerplate code, every single time.strongp  precodeNSError error [managedObjectContext saveamperror] if error      NSLogError while saving , error  codepre  ul liAdvantages Error dont pass silently  Im alerted to them and given debugging information.li liDisadvantages Its horribly verbose. Its slower to write, slower to read, and when its nested within some levels of indentation already, I feel that it makes the code less readable. Routinely doing this just for logging errors, and getting used to skipping over the boilerplate while reading, also makes me sometimes fail to notice when some code Im reading actually has significant error handling blocks for errors that are expected to happen at runtime.li ul  pComing from a background of languages like Python, Java, PHP and Javascript, I find it kind of cumbersome to have to write 4 extra lines of boilerplate to get notified of the kind of errors that, in the languages Im used to, Id find out about through an exception or warning without ever having to write any code that explicitly checks for errors.p  pWhat Id ideally like is some cunning hack that I can use to automatically log the errors created by these methods without needing to write the boilerplate on every method call, thus giving me the benefits of both the lazy NULLpassing approach and the errorlogging boilerplate. In other words, Id like to write thisp  precode[managedObjectContext saveampmagicAutologgingError] codepre  pand know that if the method created an codeNSErrorcode, it would somehow, magically, be logged.p  pIm not too sure how to go about this. I considered using an codeNSErrorcode subclass that logs itself upon codedealloccode, but realised that since Im not responsible for instantiating the error objects that Cocoas methods create, my subclass wouldnt be used anyway. I considered using method swizzling to make emallem codeNSErrorcodes log themselves on codedealloccode like this, but Im not sure if that would actually be desirable. I thought about using some sort of observer class that watches a given constant space in memory that I could use for the codeNSErrorcode pointers that I want to log, but as far as I know theres no way to do anything like KVO for observing arbitrary spaces in memory, so I cant see an approach for implementing this other than having a thread that repeatedly checks for errors to log.p  pCan anyone see a way to achieve thisp

Negative 22606 pGood Day All, p  pI apologise in advance for what is probably a pretty simple problem for many of you. p  pBasically a file is saved down every hour into a certain folder file ext .AMA, and I would like to create an SSIS package that runs every hour and imports only the last modified file into a SQL Server database. p  pI realise I need to use the script component to do this, but I have zero working knowledge of vb.net Im stuck with VS 2005. Also, Im not sure if this needs to be done within a Foreach Loop Container or if its possible to go directly from the scrip component to the OLE DB Destination p  pWould anyone be kind enough to give me a sample script that I can work off, and explain to me how to incorporate it into an SSIS package I cant make head nor tale of script solutions Ive seen from Googling, and many of them seem to be using C anyway. p  pGoing by the last modified datetime should be okay, but there is a datetime in the filename in the following format YYMMDDHHMM, Im not sure how useful that would be though. p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 22606 pI am developing a project using codeigniter that has common header and footer. By using pjax I am able to dynamically change the content alone without disturbing the header and the footer. Also the url changes with respect to the controller. Below is my concern over the url and SEO analogy.p  pMy default home page controller loads the header, index page and the footer as shown below.p  precodepublic function index     thisgtloadgtmodeldbmodel     data[about]  thisgtdbmodelgtabout     thisgtloadgtviewtemplatesheader,data     thisgtloadgtviewincludesindex,data     thisgtloadgtviewtemplatesfooter  codepre  pSuppose I click on a menu item, it loads the corresonding controller path in the url say  a hrefhttpdomain.commainbandDirectory relnofollowhttpdomain.commainbandDirectorya and the pjax content div alone is replacedupdated with the content while header and footer remaining the same. p  precodepublic function bandDirectory     thisgtloadgtmodeldbmodel     data[content]  thisgtdbmodelgtband     thisgtloadgtviewincludesbandDirectory,data  codepre  pThis works fine when the menu items are navigated from the home page as it loads the header and footer initially. But what if we directly hit the url say a hrefhttpdomain.commainbandDirectory relnofollowhttpdomain.commainbandDirectorya. This controller does not contain header and footer and it loads only the content which breaks the page apart This would become a serious issue if search engines indexes these urls. How to overcome this issue   p  pP.S  Since I am implementing a player in the header, I do not want to include header and footer in all the controllers as this would stop the player from playing when header refreshes.p

Negative 22606 pI am using Elasticsearch to index documents that have an owner which is stored in a userId property of the source object.

Negative 22606 pIm writing an LALR parser generator as a pet project.p  pIm using the purple dragon book to help me with the design, and what I gather from it is that  there are four methods of error recovery in a parserp  ul liPanic mode Start dumping input symbols until a symbol preselected by the compiler designer is foundli liPhraselevel recovery Modify the input string into something that allows the current production to reduceli liError productions Anticipate errors by incorporating them into the grammarli liGlobal correction Way more complicated version of phraselevel recovery as I understand itli ul  pTwo of these require modifying the input string which Id like to avoid, and the other two require the compiler designer to anticipate errors and design the error recovery based on their knowledge of the language. But the parser generator also has knowledge about the language, so Im curious if theres a better way to recover from parsing errors without preselecting synchronizing tokens or filling up the grammar with error productions.p  pInstead of picking synchronizing tokens, cant the parser just treat symbols in the follow of all the nonterminals the current production can reduce to as synchronizing tokens I havent really worked out how well that would work  I visualize the parser being down a chain of inprogress productions but of course thats not how bottomup parsers work. Would it produce too many irrelevant errors trying to find a workable state Would it attempt to resume the parser in an invalid state Is there a good way to prefill the parser table with valid error actions so the actual parsing program doesnt have to reason about where to go next when an error is encounteredp

Negative 22606 pemstrongPreliminary Infoemstrong I am writing a program that has 2 groups of threads. Group 1 threads each have a string that they take in and compute a SHA256 hash and stick that hash into a shared object. Group 2 threads each have a username and hashed password associated with them.

Negative 22606 pBased on the article a hrefhttpworldmodscode.wordpress.com20121214thejavabytebufferacrashcourse relnofollowherea, compareTo method on the ByteBuffers might not work correctly when dealing with negative numbersp  precodebytes in Java are signed, contrary to what one typically expects. What is easy to miss though, is the fact that this affects ByteBuffer.compareTo as well. The Java API documentation for that method reads  Two byte buffers are compared by comparing their sequences of remaining elements  lexicographically, without regard to the starting position of each sequence within its corresponding buffer.  A quick reading might lead one to believe the result is what you would typically expect,  but of course given the definition of a byte in Java, this is not the case. The result  is that the order of byte buffers that contains values with the highest order bit set,    will diverge from what you may be expecting. codepre  pI tried a couple of examples of putting negative values into the buffer, and comparing with positives, it was always OK. Is the article speaking of the case when we e.g. read in binary data, when an integer code1code was stored as code100000...001code and that would cause issuesp

Negative 22606 pI have a Solution divided into 3 projects.br Two of them are MVC 5 web apps which use ASP.Net Identity provider.br One is a class library which is referenced by the other projects. All the CRUD actions take place in here.   p  pAll the projects point to same DB and operate via EF.   p  pAll the business logic happens in the class library but is user agnostic. User validation happens in web apps only. Problems here are user validation code is repeated across all web projects and the class library has no idea of the user invoking an API.br This kind of architecture will bring maintenance nightmares very soon so I would like only the class library to talk to db for business logic or user validation.br Now, since ASP.Net Identity provider doesnt work in class libraries, anybody found a way around it p

Negative 22606 pI am currently trying to create a header file that takes information from a user and displays information in a form.p  pFor the most part, I have had no problem, however, I need the user to input their date of birth in the format MMDDYYYY, and then convert it to MMDDYYYY and display it in the form.p  pMy problem is that if the user inputs the month 0109, what displayed was nowhere near correct. I still need to display the month the exact way the user input it, so it has to be displayed as i.e. 01011967.p  pThe variable for the patients date of birth is called codeint patientDateOfBirthcode.  This data type cannot be changed, it has to be an int.p  pThe method in the header file that I am using is as followsp  precodevoid PatientDemographicInformationprintPatientDateOfBirth       int userMonth, userDay, userYear     String birthDate  StringitoapatientDateOfBirth       Calculation to determine month, day, and year from the MMDDYYYY format.     userMonth  scanf d, ampuserMonth      this was another method I used, however the leading zero messed it up.      userMonth  patientDateOfBirth  1000000     userDay    patientDateOfBirth  10000  100     userYear   patientDateOfBirth  10000       cout ltlt userMonth ltlt       cout ltlt setfill0 ltlt setw2 ltlt userDay   ltlt       cout ltlt userYear  codepre  pAlso, this is the first time I am using this forum, so if my formatting is off, please forgive me.  I also have little experience with this language, so if the answer is simple, please go easy on mep  pThank you.p  pEDIT Ive just noticed that there is the variable codeString birthDatecode that is not used in the calculation.  I was not sure if converting the int into a String would work, but I gave it a shot regardless, but it did not work and I forgot to remove that variable.  If that could work, however, please let me know.p  pEDIT Sorry if I wasnt as clear as I had hoped to be.  I want the user to input a date of birth in the format MMDDYYYY and output it as MMDDYYYY, meaning I have to separate the month, day, and year into seperate variables and then put them into a cout statement. The problem that I am having is if the user puts a 01 thru 09 as the month codei.e. 01141967code, When the method tries to do the calculation, I get some strange number in the output codei.e. 112230056000048145599932code or the like.  I am completely stumped by this dilemma.  Ive searched forever trying to find some kind of answer and I have tried several methods, all not working.p

Negative 22606 pMy iBook has a clickampjump feature. A simple codelocation.href.hashidcode results in a pageturning effect even if the element in question is already being shown on the screen. So I want to detect if the element in question is already being displayed. My logic to do this works fine on other ereaders and iBooks for iPad, just not iPhone. p  pIn iBooks on the iPhone, it appears that multiple pages into which a file is paginated are organized in lefttoright fashion on the coordinate system. The problem is that if I am on the second page of a file, codegetBoundingClientRectcode returns an xcoordinate of, say, 250 for an element falling on that second page so far so good, since the element is indeed one page over to the right from the left side of the page. The problem is that the left coordinate of the window, whether I access it with codewindow.scrollXcode, or codewindow.pageXOffsetcode, or codedocument.body.scrollLeftcode, or codedocument.documentElement.scrollLeftcode, is always returned as zero, whereas it should be a positive number indicating that the screen is displaying a portion of the page scrolled to the right. Since it is zero, it appears that the element in question is emnotem visible off to the right, and I need to set codelocation.hrefcode, which causes the undesirable pageturning effect.p  pI have a vague suspicion that they may be playing with CSS transforms which are not reflected in the results of the codegetBoundingClientRectcode call.

Negative 22606 pIn the scope of a project that Im currently working, I use binary data stored in arrays of 10 bytes, and Im trying to find a fast way to compare them.

Negative 22606 pI have a problem after refactoring code of Test Application backend. Test has questions and answers, each question has multiple answers and only one of them is correct.p  pAfter some debugging everything seems to work fine, but all questions and answers managing logic was located in one controller. I moved answers logic to separate nested controller and after that stuck with this problem. Tried different methods but none of them helped.p  pThe goal is to combine Angular UI Tree Example 4  Groups amp Categories with Angular UI Bootstrap Modal.p  pBy design adding and editing questions and answers are happening in modal window. The template is located separately so its not repeated with each question and answer. When provided data is not valid, validation errors are shown, otherwise the success alert is shown and all fields clear and back to default state all that happens inside the modal window, its stay opened and can be closed only by hitting Cancel, X button or keyboard Esc button.p  pI need to update codeQuestionsCtrl scope.questionscode from modal window trigger button is located inside template of modal window. After hitting Add button codescope.questionscode will become updated in scope and the ui.tree is also updated in background. The success alert or validation errors doesnt shown, form fields doesnt clear.

Negative 22606 pI only see one unanswered question related to a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions22254997refreshlistviewwithcheckeditemsthisa, so I thought I would try asking again.p  pI have a codeListViewcode that populates from a codestringcode array.  The reason I need to repopulate the codeListViewcode is because I set the foreground color on some items depending on the current time, and the only way Ive found to set the foreground color is when the item is added to the codeListViewcode. If theres a way to change the color of existing items that would be great, but I cant find a way. Its frustrating that codeListViewcode is different in the Windows Store than in Windows desktop WPF apps.p  pAnyway, when items are selected the selections checkmarks disappear once the list is repopulated.  Ive found a way to find which items are currently selected before the refresh I think by using codevar selecteditems  myListView.SelectedItemscode but trying to use that to recheck the items after the refresh seems futile.  Any help is greatly appreciated as Ive been racking my brains for weeks over this.  It seems it should be so simple so Im really frustrated.p  pAnother way I was thinking would be to do a codeforeachcode on each item and checking if code.IsSelectedcode is true, but I cant seem to associate each separate item that way.p  pIn my mind Im thinking do something likep  precodeforeach ListViewItem Item in ListView.Items        if Item.isselected          do something so to remember which items are selected  codepre  pThen at some point after the new codeListViewcode is populated, do another codeforeachcode and if it matches the previous selected item, select it again. However, just programmatically selecting items seems difficult in Windows 8.1 Store Apps VS2013.  It even seems codeArrayListcode is no longer available now.

Negative 22606 pSo I have a PHP application running well on my local server, powered by Zend Server. After I uploaded it to the ubuntu server, it stops working, except for two php file, the index.php and register.php, which handles the user registration part. When I say working, it means I can view the page as in my local server but the internal process is not functioning. For example, when I try to register a user, it should tell me whether it is successful or not. Instead, it is a just a blank page. p  pI rule out the directory problem. All the path are relative and they are working fine. I also rule out the MySQL database problem as I can access the database and do everything with it.

Negative 22606 pI have a network a graph of 50 vertices and 70 edges.

I am trying to implement a search algorithm in order to find the networks best combination of iterative changes by looking ahead n steps into the futures.p  pThis algorithm should evaluate the fitness difference between the network at iteration t and the network at iteration tn, pick the first step of the path that leads to the best fitness improvement, and once again look n steps ahead, repeat until I reach a good enough overall network fitness.p  pAlas, Im having a lot of difficulties wrapping my head around this problem.

Negative 22606 pIve essentially implemented a feature in my app which is very similar to the way Gmail works in the sense than you can enter emails into an EditText and after clicking an ADD button it wraps it into a bubble a TextView with a BitmapDrawable for the background. p  pOn many devices when you click backspace on the keyboard the email TextView is deleted perfectly and works exactly like Gmail. However, on the Nexus 7 and a few other devices you have to hold down the backspace for a while until it deletes the email. You essentially have to hold the backspace down to delete as many characters are in the TextView i.e. if there is 9 characters, press the backspace 9 times until the TextView is gone.p  pIs there anyway I can register it to say something like.. if backspace hits a TextView delete it Im struggling to get around this issues because its only on a few devices.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 22606 pIm trying to plot large numbers of points that have varying appearance shape, edge color, face, color, etc. and am finding that plotting the obvious way using codeplotcode for each point takes a very long time. I see various ways to improve performance, but find that these either reduce flexibility in point appearance, or end up being far more low level than seems correct to me.p  pFor example, if I havep  precodefig, ax  matplotlib.pyplot.subplots rands  numpy.random.randomsamplen, codepre  pwhere codencode is some large number, then using codeplotcode to plot each pointp  precodefor x in rangen     ax.plotx, rands[x], o, colorstrrands[x], mecstr1rands[x] codepre  ptakes a very long time and seems very inefficient. Much faster results can be achieved with by plotting many points at oncep  precodeax.plotrangen, rands, o, colorb, mecr codepre  pbut with a loss of control over many features of the individual points here, for example neither codecolorcode nor codemeccode can be a list, and many other aspects suffer the same limitation. Using convenience methods like codescattercode p  precodeax.scatterrangen, rands, markero, color[stry for y in rands] codepre  palso produces fast results but again at the loss of considerable flexibility though points can be colored individually, codeplotcodes remaining options for setting features of individual points are not supported and of some automatic axis limiting use of codesetxlimcode and codesetylimcode seem necessary to accomplish what codeplotcode does automatically.p  pFinally, I see many examples that use graphic elements like circles in conjunction with a hrefhttpmatplotlib.orgapicollectionsapi.html relnofollowcollectionsa which, while fast for common use cases, result in code that looks to low level to mep  precodepatches  [] colors   []  for x in rangen     circ  matplotlib.patches.Circlexfloatn, rands[x], .01     colors.append[rands[x],rands[x],rands[x]]     patches.appendcirc  collection  matplotlib.collections.PatchCollectionpatches collection.setfacecolorcolors collection.setedgecolor[[1h for h in c] for c in colors] ax.addcollectioncollection codepre  psince it not only embreaks the abstraction of plotting pointsem, but also requires considerable scaling and adjustment to restore even partially the appearance provided automatically by codeplotcode here for example codematplotlib.pyplot.axisequalcode is necessary to avoid distorted points. p  pThis is frustrating because codeplotcode seems the natural method to use as it provides all the right customization of individual points, and results in figures that are nicely scaled and with axes that are naturally bounded its just too slow when used a point at a time, and doesnt accept lists as arguments for most properties.p  pWhat is the correct Pythonic way to plot large numbers of points where features of each point marker, edge color, face color, alpha, size, etc. must potentially be customized Is using circles or other shapes and collections followed by scaling and other tweaking of the figure really the preferred or at least necessary approachp

Negative 22606 pMy issue is that I have created a working CodePen that demonstrates my idea perfectly. When implementing the code on the web server it stops working correctly.p  pSpecifically, my checkboxes should only allow one checkbox to be checked at a time. When the user attempts to check more than one, it unchecks the most recent, and gives an alert. It does this by checking for the checked property when the function is called. Depending on the property, a point is added or subtracted from the checkbox counter. Following, the checkbox counter is checked to ensure only one is selected  otherwise, it subtracts a point and unchecks the most reset checkbox.  p  pWhen demonstrating on the web server, clicking each box subtracts from the checkbox counter. This in turn only allows for a constantly downward counting counter  no check really going on.p  pSo my question Why does the checkbox seem to ignore the fact that it is checkedp  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idcontainergt   ltinput idthisone classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthisonegtHaltlabelgt   ltinput idthatone classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthatonegtMwahaltlabelgt   ltinput idthishere classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthisheregtHiltlabelgt   ltinput idthatthere classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthattheregtHelloltlabelgt   ltdivgt lth3gtlth3gt codepre  pstrongJSstrongp  precodevar DATA     incomeChecks 0     function incomeChecke    h3.textincome check, launched.

Negative 22606 pIm trying to do something very specific in the fractal program a hrefhttpapophysis7x.org relnofollowApophysis 7Xa, the scripting language in use is Pascal the project is a hrefhttpssvn.code.sf.netpapophysis7xsvntrunk relnofollowwritten in Delphia.p  pWhat I want to do Write a script that can dynamically address certain variables.

Negative 22606 pIm having a weird issue. Im writing a function to delete a line from a list of names created elsewhere, which, after some research, seems like it should be fairly simple. I write the current list of names into a list, display the list, have the user input the name they want to delete, remove the userinputted name from the list, then display the updated list to the user.p  pUp to here, everything works perfectly, but when I write the list back into the file, the last name gets a random amount of characters chopped off of it, ranging from a couple of characters to the entire line. Now, this is where it gets strange. If I open the file and look at it without exiting the program, the last line of the file is messed up and continues to be whenever I display it later in the program. But, if I exit the program and then open the file, the last line is back to how it was originally written That file is not written to again by the program after the list is written  in, so I cannot imagine why this is happening.p  pI almost decided that since the file ultimately comes out of the program correct, I could just ignore the issue, but I want the user to be able to view the list of names after the deletion for various reasons, which is made impossible while the last list item prints incorrectly.p  pI am still fairly beginner with C, so Im kind of hoping that this is just an issue of me not fully understanding lists or something. Regardless, dumbed down explanations would be ace.p  pI included the function below, any help is much appreciated.p  precodechar act, charname[50] string namestr list ltstringgt c1 list ltstringgtiterator c1Iter  write the names from the file into a list ifstream namesList of Names.txt while stdgetlinenames, namestr      c1.pushbacknamestr   print the current names cout ltlt Registered names for c1Iter  c1.begin c1Iter  c1.end c1Iter     cout ltlt n ltlt setw5 ltlt   ltlt c1Iter  choose which names to delete and confirm cout ltlt nnEnter the name you would like to delete  cin.getlinecharname, 50 cin.getlinecharname, 50 cout ltlt nAre you sure Enter y to permanently delete  ltlt charname ltlt , and any other key to return to the start screen. cin gtgt act  if act  y  act  Y      delete a file associated with each name     string strnamecharname     strname.append.txt     if removestrname.cstr lt 0         perrorError deleting file      else              delete name from the file only if that persons individual file is successfully deleted         c1.removecharname         cout ltlt n ltlt charname ltlt  successfully deletedn          print the updated list of names         cout ltlt nUpdated list of registered namesn         for c1Iter  c1.begin c1Iter  c1.end c1Iter             cout ltlt c1Iter ltlt endl          write updated list of names over List of Names to update the file         ofstream newNamesList of Names.txt         for c1Iter  c1.begin c1Iter  c1.end c1Iter             newNames ltlt c1Iter ltlt endl         newNames.close       codepre
Negative 22606 pIve seen that a hrefhttpwww.medium.com relnofollowMedium.coma as well as a hrefhttpdrive.google.com relnofollowGoogle Drivea docssheetsetc. all use draft content saving so your editing doesnt get lost. Well Googles version is used for content versioning, but thats just an additional side effect as theyre apparently not updating the same content but rather saving all of them getting content history records.p  pstrongIm interested in the way these two internally work.strongp  pIf you observe Ajax calls being exchanged between the client and server one can see that both of them send some sort of partial content or user action saves. These kind of draft saving is very quick because even lengthy content can utilize tiny requests making draft saving a quick process. The problem is of course because these partial saves are now stateful, so they heavily rely on existing content state.p  pIm also working on a web app that would benefit from such feature of tiny and quick saves, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel and jumping over all the hurdles. Im not sure whether I should be p  ol liprecording keystrokes and send them immediately which would then have to be emreplayedem on the server to actually generate matching content state there.pli lipshould it work in any other way like recording keystrokes and sending them in predefined intervals pli lipnot recording keystrokes at all but rather calculating content diffs in some way. Content diffs are done in CVSs like GitHub and I suppose this algorithm is very well defined by now and correctly shows removed as well as added content. If this process is not too complex for clientside processing I may go down this route and send small diffspli ol  pThese are just three ways from the top of my head although the first two are similar in nature but there may be others that I havent thought about.p  pIm sure some of you may have done this before and have some experience as well as pros and cons of different techniques and if theres maybe an existing open source lib that can help simplify this without doing it all from scratch.p  pstrongHow should this be donestrongp

Negative 22606 pI am wondering if there are any way in laravel to send a variable to the layout master and keep it there while the user is logged in. I know how I can do it, like this p  precodethisgtlayoutgtwithcatalog.categories, data codepre  pBut the problem of this is that I will have to be sending the variable on all the controllers and through all the class. And to get the variable I will need seven or eight lines of code on top of that.p  pI will give you an easy example. Imagine I have a messenger center in my web. And I want to show the user all the messages he did not read on the top bar. It has to be on the layout master and stay there until he read the messages. Do I have to pass this variable every single time the user changes the routep

Negative 22606 pA few days ago I read the following article about the C Memory Model a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinejj863136.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinejj863136.aspxap  pThis article states that the JIT compiler is allowed to reorder memory operations when ordinary that is, nonvolatile fields are being used.p  pFigure 9 demonstrates an example of a polling loop that is supposed to be brokenp  precodeclass PollingLoopExample    private bool loop  true   public static void Main        PollingLoopExample test1  new PollingLoopExample      Set loop to false on another thread     new Thread gt  test1.loop  false.Start      Poll the loop field until it is set to false     while test1.loop       The previous loop may never terminate     codepre  pThe text states that on x86 and x64 archtectures, the polling loop example will typically hang.

This method is overwritten by codeBarcode and codeBazcode which extends the general loading of the codetitlecode property in codeFoocode class with their own properties which have to be loaded.p  pSo in code this would look something like thisp  pstrongClass Foostrongp  precodeabstract class Foo      protected ID     protected title      public static function loadID, PDO pdo              result  null           SQL query for getting title property into result          return result            getters and setters  codepre  pIn the class strongBarstrong I do thisp  precodeclass Bar extends Foo      protected text      public function constructstdClass data              thisgtID  datagtID         thisgttext  datagttext           public static function loadID, pdo              generalInfo  parentloadID, pdo          result  null           PDO query for getting text property into result          generalInfogttext  result          return generalInfo            getters and setters  codepre  pSo this let me call codedataToCreateInstance  Barload4, pdoInstancecode and returns the needed information to instanciate the specific codeBarcode object with ID 4.p  pThe probleme here is as you can see my classes are bound to PDO also its really ugly to implement a codeloadcode method for each data source so its not generic at all.p  h2What I want to achieveh2  pIm looking now for a pattern which let me load those classes from any source. I thought about a codeLoadercode class which looks like thisp  precodeclass LoaderManager             var Loader[]           protected loaders  array      public function registerLoaderclassName, loaderClass              thisgtloaders[className]  loaderClass           public function loadClassclass, ID              return thisgtloaders[class]gtloadID       codepre  pand with an abstract Loader classp  precodeabstract class Loader      public abstract function loadID  codepre  pSo now I have decoupled the thing. The problem with this attempt is that I have always to provide an additional codeLoadercode for the class itselfs. So for the class codeBarcode I have to provide at least one of codeBarLoaderPDOcode or codeBarLoaderJSONcode. Which is somehow not that elegant and feels a bit wrong.p  pAlso there is the problem that I have to store somewhere the mapping which class in the current application has to use which loader.p  pBut it is the only attempt I can think of which leads me to that what I want to achieve.p  pstrongI like now to discuss and hear if there are other better attempts and how to realize them.strongp

Negative 22606 pMy application currently extracts data from an excel document, putting the data into a listview.  I then am able to open each of the stringsitems within the listview which are pdf files in a given directory.  However the pdf files within the given directory have revision letters at the end of their file names, starting with A for the first revision and B for the second revision...and so on. So I am trying to approach it like comparing the string to the files in the directory and then once its found, check what the latest rev letter is if any. So if there is 07010302A.pdf file in the directory and theres also a 07010302B.pdf in the directory, I want to store that file name 07010302B.pdf to a new string in my vb application.

Negative 22606 pSo I am making a physics engine that only uses rectangles axisaligned bounding boxes as shapes. I have implemented a method from christer ericsons book that returns the collision time and normal of two moving aabbs. I also have made another method that takes two aabbs velocities, positions and a normal that responds to the collision and give the aabbs new velocities. p  pThe actual problem now is is that I dont know how the loop, that checks the collisions between all aabbs and responds to them, should look like. Simply I dont understand how to order the collisions by the time of impact, and which collision I should respond to. p  pA loop written in pseudo code that shows how to order all collisions would be really helpful. p  pAnother thing Ive mentioned is that its possible thata moving box could bounce between two static boxes hundreds of times in a single frame if its velocity is really high, how do you handle thatp

Negative 22606 pContext I am using an codeUICollectionViewcode for a photoview. Every picture is a cell with one codeUIImagecode. Images can have different sizes and I want them to fill the whole screen. So I wrote a class who determines the frame of every single codeUICollectionCellcode and let a subclass of codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutcode ask that class for the right frame for every item.p  pMy implementation of the codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutClasscodep  precodeoverride func layoutAttributesForElementsInRectrect CGRect gt [AnyObject]      let attributesToReturn  super.layoutAttributesForElementsInRectrect as [UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes]     for attributes in attributesToReturn  []          if attributes.representedElementCategory  .Cell              let frame  self.layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPathattributes.indexPath.frame             attributes.size  frame.size             attributes.frame  frame                   return attributesToReturn   override func layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPathindexPath NSIndexPath gt UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes      let curAttributes  super.layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPathindexPath     let frame  mazeManager.sizeForItemAtIndexindexPath, collectionView collectionView     curAttributes.size  frame.size     curAttributes.frame  frame     return curAttributes  codepre  pSo the frame asks my MazeManager to give back a frame. The returned frames seem to be correct and they all fit in the UICollectionView.p  pWhen I open my app everything looks fine, even when I scroll. But when I scroll to a specific position this position feels random because it depends on the images I test with, but with the same set of images the positions are the same cells disappear from my view. When I scroll back they return.p  pIve checked if the cells where not hidden, but they never are.p  pOn some other threads with similar issues the answer is to implement the codecollectionViewContentSizecode so I didp  precodeoverride func collectionViewContentSize gt CGSize      let size  mazeManager.collectionViewContentSize     return size.height lt collectionView.frame.size.height  collectionView.frame.size  size  codepre  pThe number of items is not static and it grows while reaching the end of the view. So what happens here is The manager determines the Origin.y  the Size.Height of the last item  10 points to be sure, the width is the width of the UICollectionView.p  pStill all the frames of the cells are within the sizes returned by this method. But still some cell disappear or never appear at all.p  pWhen I scroll further through the UICollectionView I see other cells which are positioned on the right place. So there are gaps in my view, but the flow continues. When a gap appears there are no calls for the items at the missing idexpaths in the collectionViewDelegate. For example the CollectionView asks for items 1,2,3,4,5,6, 12,13,14.p  pThe console prints nothing about wrong positioning, Ive checked and everything is within the ContentSize. So Im almost out of options. Can anybody explain whats happening in my casep  pThank you.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pWhile I was looking for a solution, I already found the mentioned post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13360975uicollectionviewscelldisappearingUICollectionView39s cell disappearinga and I already did 3 of the 4 steps.p  precodeoverride func shouldInvalidateLayoutForBoundsChangenewBounds CGRect gt Bool      return true  codepre  pAnd I just added the scroll direction in the initializerp  precodeoverride init     super.init     scrollDirection  .Vertical   required initcoder aDecoder NSCoder      super.initcoder aDecoder     self.scrollDirection  .Vertical  codepre  pUnfortunately this doesnt fix my issue, so it doesnt seem a duplicate to me.p

I am able to make the request, append the information and make the favorited GISTs appear in another section HOWEVER, the lists only appear for a moment and then disappear after I click on the favorite button.

Negative 22606 pI am currently working with a set of textboxes in a grid that represent days of the week. There is also a drop down list with its selected index that also shows the dates for the week. Also there is a text area that represents specific comments for each day of the chosen week as well.p  pWhen focusing, either with clicks or TAB, my Javascript function calls out the server side method C for the selected index change method of the data drop down. Each day passes its index back to the function, then runs the SelectedIndexChanged method. p  pThis way when I click on a week day, I can show the comments and change the date drop down, rather than have to resort to using the drop down.p  pI did this by adding the attributes like so p  precodegridTextBox.Attributes.Addonfocus, changeSelectedDayComments  index.ToString   codepre  pAll that said, the issue Im facing is when I try to enter text in a cell, flicker occurs and deletes my text. Is there a corresponding way of adding attribute for onBlur after using onFocus to call to a method, using Javascript only Thanks in advancep

Negative 22606 pI have written a class using ITK in CPP which reads all files in a directory and then averages them.

Negative 22606 pI cant compile my project when I include codeltboostnumericodeintintegrateintegrate.hppgtcode in a precompiled header and compile using Mingw4.9.232bit from Qt 5.4.

But Why is this file so large Is there a way to reduce the compiled header file size p  pWhen I compile the code using MSVC 2013 I dont get this problem and the precompiled headers are about 40 MB reasonable. When I compile in the MacOS 10.10 using clang I also dont get this problem.p  pIn essence what I am trying to do is to speed up the compilation time when I use Odeint.

Maybe a 64bit version of Mingw would work better BTW, yesterday I tried the compilation process with the precompiled headers using clang on the Mac and the compilation succeeded as expected and the time of execution was fantastic lest than 10 seconds for the first compile and then after the PCH was done it took less than 1 second to recompile for every iteration, on Windows with MSVC I get about 20 seconds for the first time and 10 seconds for recompilation, and of course on Mingw I cant even compile.p

Negative 22606 pSorry if it sounds like a basic or dumb question but Im stronger in PHPampMysql programmming than cssampjquery animation yet. I am building a mostly css3 based menu for an application. The menu is positioned on the left side of the screen and has a small width 31px showing an image only that is not included in the fiddle. When you hover one of the element in the list a css3 animation will make that element 187px larger showing some text. Some elements of this list contains a second level menu. What I have now can be seen on the fourth element named Incassi amp Spese. What I am trying to achieve is on the second item Dati di base. The sublevel menu is on a wrapperinside div that is absolute positioned under the relevant menu item and should slideDown when hovering the relevant text dati di base in this example. I have set up this javascript to do the animation but it is not workingp  precodedocument.readyfunction     .wrapperinside.slideUpnormal     .menu gt li gt a.hover         function                setTimeoutthis.next.wrapperinside.slideDownnormal,1000         ,function             this.next.wrapperinside.slideUpnormal                  codepre  pNot working means that when I hover the item the wrapperinside is not sliding down. The timeout function is made to wait for the animation on the first level menu to end before sliding down. I have set up a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netleliofa29jmhs052 relnofollowfiddlea that display the full situation and can be found here.  strongThe best would be to get rid of the js at all and complete the slide down with css3 transition but I have to admit I dont know how to trigger a transition on one element while hovering anotherstrongp  pEDIT I fixed the syntax error and the hover now works. But I cannot keep it open while hovering the wrapperinside. How to do itp

Negative 22606 pAs far as I know, you can only initialize static const members in the same line of their declaration a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma35311055302415if they are integral types a. However, I was still able to initialize and use some static const doublesp  precode compiles and works, values are indeed doubles struct Foo1      static const double A2.5     static const double B3.2     static const double C1.7    compiles, but values are cast to int struct Foo2     static const int A2     static const int B3     static const double CBA becomes 1    does not compile, Foo3B cannot appear in a constantexpression struct Foo3      static const int A2     static const double B3     static const double CAB     does not compile, a cast to a type other than an integral or enumeration  cannot appear in a constantexpression struct Foo4      static const int A2     static const int B3     static const double CdoubleAB   codepre  pFoo2 compiles but Foo2C becomes 1, so maybe it is treated as an int as it is numerically one. Foo3 and Foo4 dont even compile, as expected. However, I dont understand why Foo1 both compiles and works correctly. Is this specific usage accepted Is it because of some optimization  Ive tried using O1 and O0 p  pNote using GNU 5.2.0 with cmake and setting the standard to C98. Switching to C11 works fine  that is, does not compile and asks to switch those members to constexpr. p
