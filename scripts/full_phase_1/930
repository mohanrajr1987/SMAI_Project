Also on the search form, I have a subreport that is bound to the query.p  pMy plan is to have the user filter though the data using the controls on the form. As the user filters out components, the report should update to display what components pass the new query. They would then select the component they are interested in by clicking on a record in the report, and that component ID would be passed into VBA to do more stuff.p  pMy problem is that the report bound to the query will not update as the query does.  I have tried using DoCmd.Requery and Me.Form.Refresh on the button click event, but havent gotten anywhere. It only works if I close the form, then reopen it. p  pstrongHow do I get my bound report to change dynamically as the user modifies the SQL of its source querystrong p  pHeres my click event codep  precodePrivate Sub cmdApplyFiltersClick Call updateSearchFilters Me.Requery Me.Form.Refresh End Sub codepre  pHeres my sub to update the queryp  precodePublic Sub updateSearchFilters Dim strSQL As String Dim searchQryDef As DAO.QueryDef  strSQL  searchSQLstrBuilderFormsfrmSearch.tboCompID, FormsfrmSearch.tboDesc, FormsfrmSearch.cboType, FormsfrmSearch.cboVendor, FormsfrmSearch.tboVendPN Set searchQryDef  CurrentDb.QueryDefsqrySearchRes searchQryDef.SQL  strSQL End Sub codepre  pHeres my SQL string builderp  precodePublic Function searchSQLstrBuildertboCompID As TextBox, tboDesc As TextBox, cboType As ComboBox, cboVend As ComboBox, tboVPN As TextBox As String searchSQLstrBuilder  SELECT tblDocs.compID, tblComponents.Desc, tblComponents.type, tblComponents.vend, tblComponents.vendorPN  searchSQLstrBuilder  searchSQLstrBuilder amp FROM tblComponents INNER JOIN tblDocs ON tblComponents.numComp  tblDocs.numComp   Dim strCompID, strDesc, strType, strVend, strVPN As String strCompID  tboCompID.Value strDesc  tboDesc.Value strType  cboType.Value strVend  cboVend.Value If IsNulltboVPN.Value Then     strVPN       searchSQLstrBuilder  searchSQLstrBuilder amp WHERE tblDocs.compID Like  amp strCompID amp  AND tblComponents.Desc Like  amp strDesc amp  AND tblComponents.type Like  amp strType amp  AND tblComponents.vend Like  amp strVend amp  AND [vendorPN] Is Null Or tblComponents.vendorPN Like  amp strVPN amp  Else     strVPN  tboVPN.Value     searchSQLstrBuilder  searchSQLstrBuilder amp WHERE tblDocs.compID Like  amp strCompID amp  AND tblComponents.Desc Like  amp strDesc amp  AND tblComponents.type Like  amp strType amp  AND tblComponents.vend Like  amp strVend amp  AND tblComponents.vendorPN Like  amp strVPN amp  End If  End Function codepre  pThanks in advance  Let me know if theres more information I can provide.p
Positive 930 pUsing Access 2013 I have a calculated a column in a query that is the codedatediffcode from a clients intake date to codenowcode, the formula is p  precodeDateDiffd,[table1][intakedate],Now codepre  pSo the column will give the total number of days the client has been our client. This works great. Each client has a total number of days populated. Now what I want to do is add those numbers up to find the total number days from that column. What I cant figure out is how to get a sum of that column to populate in a textbox. I have a form with a textbox that I want to sum to show in. The formula I assumed would work is p  precodeSum[queryname][columnname]  codepre  pbut that is not working. p
Positive 930 pI have a database built by total morons. They did not use any relationships at all and put everything into one table. They asked me if I could extract some useful informations out of it and clean it up. p  pSay I have a table called MEMBERS, one of the columns in that table is Email addresses. p  pIn this column all the emailadresses are split by semicolons, so a possible input could be p  pemlalalalaland.com ronnyronnywebs.com tomatopulpketch.upem p  pwhilst another could be just p  pemiruletheworld.comemp  pWhat I want to do now is make a new table EMAILS and a table EMAILMEMBERS, as I need a manytomany relation members can have the same parents, so the same email adresses, members also can have 4 emails.p  pThe only data I got is the messed up email column. I have to do this not only for emails, but for phone numbers aswell, but I guess that doesnt really matter as the method will be the same.p  pAnyone got an idea about how to create a custom query or macro which emsplitsem a column into multiple new records in another table, whilst creating new ones to indicate the relation and with the EMAILS table having a unique email column so no insert if the email already exists Manual is also not an option. Its a member database containing about 4000 records. Hell no.p  pThanksp
Positive 930 pIm taking the max value and min value of a table composed of Date, Time, and Load.

See SQL codep  precodeSELECT Table1.Date, Table1.Time, MinTable1.Temp AS MinLoad FROM Table1 GROUP BY Table1.Date, Table1.Time codepre  pI tried using DMin and DMax functions but instead of getting a value I got a null of the values.  I tried the syntaxp  precodeDMin[Temp], [Table1], [Time] Between 0900 And 1500 codepre  pIm fairly new to Access so any help would be appreciated.p  pThanksp
Positive 930 pUsing MS Access 2010, I need to generate the NavigationButtons of a Navigation Control at FormLoad time or similar.  To be clear, this isnt a tab control nor a ribbon nor a menu.  The use case is, there are a variable number of forms and reports that need to be added to the Navigation Control at run time.  We wont know how exactly many, or which, forms will need to be added, so they need to be added dynamically in code.  Is this possible with a Navigation Control  I can find no reference to achieving this.p  pMy instinct was something likep  precodeMe.NavigationControl0.AddButtonReport X codepre  pBut no such AddButton method exists... or any other combination of machinations or configurations that will do the job.p

Positive 930 pAlright. This is my first post ever so Ill try to be as detailed as I can.  I have a PersonAfterUpdate event on a Form named frmContactInfo, that is supposed to check a table, named tblContactInfo, for an existing record.  If the record exists, then a message pops up stating that the record already exists, and to check the name.  Then it asks if I am creating a new record with the existing name, or if the record that is returned is the same person. The problem I am having is that the DLookup shows the correct name, but does not return the correct phone number or address to my form.p  pHere is my code.  Im not super skilled at programming, but I tried to make it as understandable as possible.  If you want screen shots, let me know. This is the first time Ive actually tried to build a database, and I know my skills are not as great as some of yours.  Ive tried to research as much as I could to find the answer to this, but everything Ive tried so far brings me back to this problem where the DLOOKUP is returning the correct NewPerson, but not the correct phone number or email address.

Negative 930 pIm working on a Silverlight application where I want to take advantage of the Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX Client library. Im calling the library using the HTML Bridge that is part of Silverlight 2. Silverlight got great support for passing types between JavaScript and Managed Code, but now Ive bumped against a problem.p  pMicrosoft ASP.NET AJAX Client Libraries includes a type system, and one of the things the framework does is validating that the parameters is of correct type. The specific function Im calling is the Sys.Application.addHistoryPoint, and the validation code looks like thisp  precodevar e  Function.validateParamsarguments, [     name state, type Object,     name title, type String, mayBeNull true, optional true ] codepre  pIve tried passing all kinds of CLR types as the state parameter C structs, [ScriptableTypes], Dictionary types etc. And every time I get the error Sys.ArgumentTypeException Object of type Function cannot be converted to type Object.p  pThis error is obviously coming from the parameter validation... But WHY does ASP.NET AJAX think my types are Functions Does anyone understand the type validation in MS AJAXp  pI know I can do workarounds like calling HtmlPage.Window.Eval... and pass my JS integration as strings, but I dont want to do that. I want to pass a real .NET type as the state parameter.p

Negative 930 pI want to run a background task that reads input from a TextReader and processes it a line at a time. I want the background task to block until the user types some text into a field and clicks the submit button. Is there some flavour of TextReader that will block until text is available and lets you somehow add more text to the underlying sourcep  pI thought that a StreamReader and StreamWriter pointing to the same MemoryStream might work, but it doesnt seem to. The StreamReader sees that the MemoryStream is empty at the start, and never checks again.p  pI realize that it would be easier to write a ProcessLine method and call it whenever the user clicks the submit button. However, Im trying to design a plugin architecture, and Id like the plug ins to look like oldfashioned console apps with an input stream and an output stream. I want the plug ins input stream to just block until the user clicks the submit button with some input text.p

Negative 930 pIm working with Via Builder, from Inscriber Technology. This app merges a TGA sequence animation into one single .via file, making it much better to load large sequences, as this file is optimized.

Using their VIACODECLibTLB library, I have the following functionp  precodefunction GetFrameBitmapFrame Integer Integer codepre  pfrom tha IViaFile interface.

The following code could workp  precodeviaObject IViaFile bmp TBitmap index Integer  bmp.Handle  ViaObject.GetFrameBitmapindex codepre  pBut the resulting bitmap is the original frame with no alpha channel. Actually, its alpha channel is zero for the entire image.p  pAssuming I was doing something wrong, I tried using the GetDIBits function, to be sure there was an alpha channel somewhere. So I allocated memory long enough to store the bitmap assuming it had 4 channels and used the GetDIBits function. I got the same result as before normal frame, alpha channel zero for the entire image.p  pJust to note, Inscriber whose forums are dead, claims that its Via Builder has full alpha support. I know someone who managed to load the frames correctly, on C, using the GetDIBits function, but translating the code to Delphi didnt work.p  pAny help would be much appreciated. p  pThank you.p

Negative 930 pThe system that I am working on is an Intranet System only accessible within the company network to our staff. This is a primary system for storing data of all our customers. The system is entirely web based. There is a lot of data to be captured and held for each customer. At the moment opening up a customer record brings up all the information is input boxes, etc so that users can change them and click on the save button to update. There are about 40 to 50 pages organised with fields all over the page. There is a single top level navigation bar with a side navigation bar as well.p  pWe have decided to work on the design and layout of the pages. The first step will be to create a Detail View and an Edit View. At the moment there is no Detail View, everything is shown within the same Edit fields. p  pDo you have any good ideas on improving usability on an intranet database system web basedp
Negative 930 pI have a flex application which collects data entered by the user and posts it off to a web service I have running on a back end server.  The flex application does not authenticate users its available for anyone to use without setting up an account and communicates to the web service using HTTPS.p  pThere is an XML firewall in place for preventing certain malformed requests, DoS attacks etc and the web service validates all data received from the client.p  pIf I was to sign the content then I could use the XML firewall to verify the signature but I assume that any certificate type data I embed in the client could be extracted out of the flex app through some means of decompilation. p  pMy question is, is there any way of limiting calls to the web service to only those from my flex client  I understand that a user could input bad information but Im really trying to prevent another client or bot.p  pIf I were to introduce having user accounts to take advantage of a session based solution then presumably I still face the same issue when Im trying to set up the account in the first place would have to still be done in the flex app  p

Negative 930 pIn my Xcode project I put all my images, audio files, ect... in the resources folder. When I opened the project folder in finder all of my resources are not in a resources folder instead they are just scattered in the main folder I have a good number of files. p  pI already submitted the binary to Apple on Friday so will they care if the resources were in the main project folder Everything works, Im just paranoid, and since its only been a day should I just resubmit a fixed binary or not worry p  pI noticed when creating a project in Xcode from one of the preset templates no designated resources folder is created within the project folder. So Im figuring its okay, just want to be safe and not sorry. p
Negative 930 pI am trying to resize and rotate an image over the iPhone. i picked the image and displayed it using UIImageViewp  pand rotation of the image is done by two buttons for clockwise amp counterclockwisep  presizing of image works fine while rotation button not pressed but when i pressed to rotate image into clockwise direction and the resize the image, width of the image increases rapidly even i am trying to decrease the width.p  pand when i pressed to rotate image into counterclockwise direction and the resize the image, height of the image increases rapidly even i am trying to decrease it.p  pi found that there is some sign changed while rotating the image along with the value, coz once press the clockwise button and then counterclockwise button, and then resizing works fine.p  pi used the following code for rotating the image.p  precodeCGAffineTransform transformRotate  CGAffineTransformMakeRotationmovingAngle imageViewRotation.transform  transformRotate codepre  pwhere movingAngle is in Radians and imageViewRotation is the UIImageView which contains the image.p  pwaiting for your replyp
Negative 930 pIm not an expert in programming in general. I can find my way around ObjectiveC and Xcode and build working apps with no huge problems but when BUGs arise Im often lost as to where to begin. p  pMy app works fine on the sim but more emoftenthaniscomfortableem it crashes on the device. I looked at the crash log to see if there was any clue to start from, but, the stuff is way over my head. How can I start making use of THIS and future crash logs in debugging crash log belowp  precodeIncident Identifier D7E575E38447C2B30BD4 CrashReporter Key   8b86c9231c06465f682da95e93b4542 Process

Negative 930 pIm using the Google maps API to place a map onto a web page, just like millions of other sites have done.p  pHowever, once I click on the map and let go, the map then acts if the mouse button is still being held and drags the map all over the page. The only way to get free of this drag action is to hit F5 and reload the page.p  pIve spent several hours scouring Google to find a remedy to this but cant find any mention of this issue from anyone else.p  pThe problem can be seen at the bottom of the following page a hrefhttpwww.efdeutschland.demasterlt2010default.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.efdeutschland.demasterlt2010default.aspxap  pDoes anyone have any idea why this is occurringp
Negative 930 pCore company data is held and managed in physically separate, thirdparty, lineofbusiness applications Finance, Transport Management. Customers are created in the Finance app SQL Server, delivery information is held in the Transport Management app Oracle. Communication between the two is pointtopoint.p  pWe need to build a new application well upgrade the old one, but essentially from scratch to process customer claims for damaged or short deliveries. Claims, customer and delivery data is currently manually entered in to MS Access. This will be migrated to a SQL server DB. The app development platform is VS2008 C.p  pI would like to avoid having all of the customer and delivery data in the claims database, since we already hold it elsewhere, so I plan to produce WCF based  feeds from the LOB systems and possibly the claims db which can then be used as the data sources for the customer claims app. There will be claimspecific data entry but the core customer and delivery data would not need to be updated in the LOB apps.p  pSo far I have in mind p  blockquote   pdatabaseORMWCF br   databaseORMWCF  nbspnbspBLLUIbr   databaseORMWCF  p blockquote  pbut it feels wrong as I will be creating separate service feeds for Customers, Deliveries and Claims objectoriented services. What I also cant quite grasp is how and where I join and work across data sources within the app to produce, say, a report showing claims against deliveries per customer i.e. where I would traditionally write a query or view to get all of this from multiple tables in one DB.p  pAm I on the right track or I am missing the big picture here  should I just run regular extracts in to a claims db and work with traditional ntier  nlayer architecturep

Negative 930 pIve got a couple trees that I allow a user to drag and drop from one to another, works great except one apparent limitation. Im picking up where they drop it in the list and adding it to the dataProvider manually. The user can drop it everywhere except after the last child of any particular node it seems, since it reads that position as being between the node and its next sibling. p  pIt seems the best way to deal with this is to add something like a dummy leaf so the user has something to drop the item in front of. I dont want this leaf in the dataProvider, so is it possible to add a leaf or a folder to the tree without adding it to the dataProvider if so howp

Negative 930 pIn Evans DDD book he speaks of segregating concepts in the domain with modules. The term module can translate to a number of different things in software development, both conceptual and concrete, so Im wondering how would this concept of DDD modules be expressed in a C.NET system and if there is any direct correlation to other uses of the term module in software development For example Evans mentions that some developers express DDD modules as Java packages which I think would be analogous to .NET assemblies.p  pIm thinking that you could probably express this concept literally with separate .NET assemblies or perhaps with namespaces Which is kind of what were doing now. We are planning on reducing the number of projects within our solution to improve build times so Im really interested in how this concept could be applied in a single assembly.p  pThanksp  pmp

For example, if this is all happening using a AJAX technique, what prevents the user from being able to access the IDPass the client is using to handshake with the service p  pIt seems like this is the only stumbling block to this approach and Im stumped.p

Negative 930 pTo integrate with the current system for continuous integration, we want to use NUnit for testing non UI Silverlight code. Doing this means executing Silverlight code using the runtime of the full .NET framework which usually works just fine as long as not actually using Silverlight specific classes such as the visual elements or DependencyObject. However, some general purpose libraries such as the Reactive Extensions for Silverlight also appears to have a dependency on the Silverlight runtime agcore.p  pIs there a way of tricking the runtime into redirecting Silverlight runtime dependencies into some mock version of them Or is it possible to redirect assembly references such as Reactive Extensions at runtime altogether when running unit tests only and load their corresponding counterpart for the full .NET framework insteadp

After we ran a buildall and such a few errors popped up i.e. Widget sort not found etc. We figured out we needed to rebuild the models. So we can a symfony doctrinebuildmodels course Course Course was the table name...course the models. This worked great and fixed the broken links within Symfony.p  pThe downside is all custom code in the actions.class.php file was lost as were customizations to the form.php page.p  pMy question on this is, how do we store our own actions so they are not lost if you update a models schema Similarly templates and such are regenerated to but do not hold any customizations.p  pThere surely must be a simple solution to updating a models schema in symfonyp

Negative 930 pIm working on a source filter which feeds videoaudio captured by our software through a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDirectShow relnofollowDirectShowa graph. I got the video working relatively painlessly, but I am now trying to add an audio output pin is proving to be quite a challenge. The specific question I have is Does a audio renderer modify the actual reference clock as it is playing soundp  pIm seeing very jerky video playback. Attached below is a chunk of a log file, and it looks like once in a while the reference clock just stops while the system time keeps ticking. Does that make sensep  pOne thing I should mention is that audio samples are uLaw 8nbspkHz 8bit and each packet is exactly 120nbspms. Heres the complication When we receive audio data from the network, it doesnt come with time information, so our software assigns a sample timestamp at the time that the packet was received. Video samples get stamped by the original source, so they are accurate. If I ignore audio sample times and simply assign sample timestamps 120nbspms apart, video will play smoothly. The problem is that Im still not fully understanding the complete relationship between the reference clock and audiovideo renderers and what really puzzles me is that we have another similar source filter which plays the same data without jerking video it doesnt have logging, and I didnt get a chance to add any to see if reference clock is also modified in that case.p  pThis is that piece of the logp  precodeSys Clock    delta  StreamTime  delta   Drift between clocks  155440.755 0.005  1.838       0.005   0.000 155440.761 0.006  1.844       0.006   0.000 155440.889 0.128  1.972       0.128   0.000 155440.894 0.005  1.977       0.005   0.000 155440.899 0.005  1.982       0.005   0.000 155440.903 0.004  1.986       0.004   0.000 155440.931 0.028  2.014       0.028   0.000 155440.936 0.005  2.019       0.005   0.000 155441.019 0.083  2.080       0.061   0.022 155441.175 0.156  2.080       0.000   0.178 155441.181 0.006  2.080       0.000   0.184 155441.190 0.009  2.080       0.000   0.193 155441.197 0.007  2.080       0.000   0.200 155441.202 0.005  2.080       0.000   0.205 155441.210 0.008  2.080       0.000   0.213 155441.216 0.006  2.080       0.000   0.219 155441.220 0.004  2.080       0.000   0.223 155441.313 0.093  2.080       0.000   0.316 155441.317 0.004  2.080       0.000   0.320 155441.408 0.091  2.116       0.036   0.375 155441.412 0.004  2.120       0.004   0.375 155441.432 0.020  2.140       0.020   0.375 155441.436 0.004  2.144       0.004   0.375 155441.439 0.003  2.147       0.003   0.375 codepre

Negative 930 pI have a variety of rich data structures primarily trees that I would like to persist to disk, meaning I not only want to write them to disk but I want a guarantee that the data has been fully written and will survive a powerdown.p  pOthers seem to design ways to encode rich data structures in flat database tables as lookup tables from parent to child nodes. This facilitates running SQL queries against the data but I have no need for that I just want to save and load my trees.p  pThe obvious solution is to store everything as a blob in the data base a single entry perhaps containing a long string. Is that an abuse of the database or a recommended practice Another solution might be to use an XML database Are there any alternatives to databases that I should be consideringp  pFinally, Im doing this from F so a turnkey solution for persisting data from .NET would be ideal...p  pstrongEDITstrong Please note that formatting e.g. serialization is irrelevant as I can trivially convert between formats with F. This is about getting an acknowledgement that a write has been completed all the way down to the nonvolatile store i.e. the disk platter and no part of the written data is still being held in volatile store e.g. an RAM cache so that I can continue safe in that knowledge e.g. by deleting the old version of the data from disk.p

For editing purposes, Ive used the LinqDataSource control, enabled the EditDelete operations in the process, and I have a nice editable grid bound to some or all of the tables fields.p  pNow I have a situation where I want to edit a few fields in table A, but there are various values in linked table B that I want to display in that grid too no editing of those.  So my query looks like the below.  The fields in tblDupes cleared, notes are what I want to edit, but Id like to display those tblVoucher ones.p  precodevar theDupes  from d in db.tblDupes                            where d.dupeGroup  Ref                            select new                                                            Ref  d.dupeGroup,                                InvoiceNum  d.tblVoucher.invoiceRef,                                Value  d.tblVoucher.invoiceAmtDecimal,                                VendorNum  d.tblVoucher.vendorID,                                VendorName  d.tblVoucher.vendorName,                                Cleared  d.Cleared                                Notes  d.Notes                             codepre  pA similar but different question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2838886linqdatasourcequerymultipletablesLINQDataSource  Query Multiple Tablesa sent me looking at scott Guthries blog entry a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20070907linqtosqlpart9usingacustomlinqexpressionwiththeltasplinqdatasourcegtcontrol.aspx relnofollowhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20070907linqtosqlpart9usingacustomlinqexpressionwiththeltasplinqdatasourcegtcontrol.aspxa, where he handles various events to have a LinqDataSource with a custom query across tables.  This still seems aimed at explicitly designed classes though, even if the class has only a subset of the fields.  p  pSo my question is is there an easy way to allow committing of the changes made to the anonymous collection a changes.Submit type action, or just an easy way to display fields from another table while not involving them in the updatingp  pEDIT Thinking more, it doesnt emhaveem to be anonymous really.  Id be happy to define a class to contain the elements in that query, since it wont change often.  But, those elements would be across two tables, even though only one needs updating.  Not sure if that suggests entity framework would be more suitable  I get the feeling it wouldnt  I dont want the whole model always grouping the fields in this way.p  pThanksp

Negative 930 pWe have a customer who is running a proprietary application, that they want to extract some data from so they can display it on a Web site. The application has an export capability that writes the needed data to a MS Access .MDB file.p  pWe wrote a simple program, using MSs JET drivers, that simply copied the relevant tables to a SqlServer database, where another program would run queries against them to collect what was needed.  This worked fine for a number of years.p  pThen the vendor updated their proprietary application, and while the .MDB files look the same, and display the correct data when viewed in MS Access, what we are getting in our program when we pull records with the JET drivers is corrupt.  It sometimes looks like the field alignments are wrong  a numeric field that should contain 23.40 will contain .23, Im getting dates in the 2150s, etc.p  pMy program, running on my machine, processing the same file works correctly.  The same program, running on the servers where it needs to run, reads corrupt data.p  pI noticed that the version of the JET driver  msjetoledb40.dll  is higher, and the date newer, on my Windows 7 box, than on any of the servers weve tried it on. so I thought it might be a problem with an outofdate driver.  Unfortunately, the latest version of the JET drivers that is available is SP 8.0, which is the version we had installed, and which isnt working.  Later versions are only available with OS installs.p  pSop  pIs there any way of getting and installing more current JET driversp  pAre we being mislead by the version differences in the JET drivers  Is there something else that could be causing the problem, that we should be looking atp  pIs there some other means or tool of extracting data from a MS Access .MDB file  Note  this is a passwordprotected file, so wed need a tool that could handle that.p

Negative 930 pI have a WPF Charting application. Basically, the user enters data from files and the application charts the data. When the number of points in the chart becomes very large I get a ContextSwitchDeadlock error that saysp  pcodeThe CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x23cda8 to COM context 0x23cf18 for 60 seconds. The thread that owns the destination contextapartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment STA threads should use pumping wait primitives such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles and routinely pump messages during long running operations.codep  pNow, I realize this is because the UI thread is not supposed to be busy for that long but Im not clear on what my options are because the entire time is spent adding components to the UI.

Negative 930 pI am writing an extremely simple Android application.  In doing so, Ive found its quite difficult for me to emulate the button UI elements that are found on the Droid X application selector screen.  For those not familiar, they are an icon with white text beneath them.  The text has a black rounded rectangle behind it and when the button is clicked, the background beneath the icon and text turns red.p  pMy current solution involves StateListDrawables, but then the rounded rectangle has a fixed width, and has to be edited into every button icon.  Localization is an eventual goal, so my solution is temporary at best.  I assume theres a less stupid way to do thisp

I would now provide a button in the GUI by which the user can load further 100 records. br The goal would be to load the next 100 records by integrating them with the existing data, rather than load the 400 3000  100 most updated records.p  pOne solution would be to get the data via webMethod and Ajax call and then build 100 table cells lt td and append them at the bottom of the table.p  pBut I found this approach less than optimal. brI use the DataTables Jquery plugin to provide some nice feature like ordering and columns reordering.p  pstrongHow could I add the new records in an incremental way, without post backstrongp
Negative 930 pI have to run a pretty heavy task on PHP once a week script that curls to various locations websites, APIs, gathers, sorts data and inserts it into a db. The whole script takes about 10 to 15 mintues to run on my mac localhost  guessing itll run a bit faster on a server. Nevertheless  Im currently looping through with AJAX, so when each task is finished, next one is launched. Now I need to run it weekly, automatically. So I think I cant do it with AJAX Anymore.p  pDo I have to just set the php.ini to let a script run for 30 mintues or there is a better way to do it p

Now I want to remove codeb1code from, and add codeb4code to the relationship, so that codea.bs  [b2, b3, b4]code, and codeb1.a  nullcode.p  pIve tried codeem.mergeacode after doing codea.setBsb2, b3, b4code, but that will result in codea.bs  [b1, b2, b3, b4]code, unless I do an explicit codeb1.setAnullcode. However, this can lead to complexity if codea.bscode changes a lot, and if codeAcode has more onetomany relationships to other entity classes. Setting codeorphanRemoval  truecode is also not the solution, because I simply want to set codeb1.a  nullcode instead of removing codeb1code.p  pThis problem has been perplexing me for quit a long time, anybody that helps me out is greatly appreciatedp
Negative 930 pI have some DataTables that I want to export to a file and then look at. I can use DataTable.WriteXml to output the contents of the DataTables to XML but whats an easy way to display this data in tabular form p  pOne suggested way is to transform the XML using XSLT or similar into something readable. I dont have any idea if thats easy or not but thatd be a fine solution if its easy to use. p  pAn example of the XML I get from WriteXml for a single DataTable is below. This is for a table named RecentMatter with 10 columns and 3 rows of data. Id like to have it displayed like a table of data. Im less concerned about formatting of data values, e.g. converting DateTime values to more readable values. I used the XmlWriteMode.WriteSchema parameter when generating this.

I have made a prototype based on HTML5, but when the mobile browser goes in the background, javascript execution is suspended.p  pI looked into creating native apps for iOS and Android. On iOS this can be done by asking for a limited amount of processing time when the application enters background mode. On Android I guess I would have to make a service that is started and stopped from the application.p  pHowever, I see that in Safari on iOS5, web workers support is back, and that this has already been supported in the Android browser for a while.

Negative 930 pI have a situation where I need to use Guice 3.0 to instantiate my object but one of the values will change potentially with each instance.

The value isnt scopespecific e.g. RequestScope either.p  pThe whole reason I want this object fully instantiated by Guice is because I need method interception. In Guice, manually constructed instances do not participate in AOP.p  pIve tried to do this with codeProviderltFoogtcode but that only allows me codepublic Foo get  ... code.p  pIt would be a configuration nightmare to have to create a provider for every possible value of codeBazcode, so I cant simply have codeBazcode be defined in FooProviders constructor.p  pI feel like Im missing something fundamental here.

Negative 930 pIve searched the site a bit for help understanding this, but havent found anything super clear, so I thought Id post my use case and see if anybody could shed some light.p  pI have a question about the scalaing of jvm threads vs os threads when used in akka for io operations.  From the akka sitep  blockquote   pAkka supports dispatchers for both eventdriven lightweight threads, allowing creation of millions threads on a single workstation, and threadbased Actors, where each dispatcher is bound to a dedicated OS thread.p      pThe eventbased Actors currently consume 600 bytes per Actor which means that you can create more than 6.5 million Actors on 4 G RAM.p blockquote  pIn this context, can you all help me understand how that matters on a workstation with only 1 processor for simplicity.  So, for my example use case, I want to take a list of say 1000 Users and then go query a database or several for various information about each user.  So if I were to dispatch each of these get tasks to an actor, and that actor is going to do IO, wouldnt that actor block based on the os thread limit for the workstationp  pHow does the akka actor model give me lift in a scenario like this  I know that I am probably missing something as I am not wildly knowledgeble on the interworkings of vm threads vs os threads, so if one of the smart folks here could spell it out for me, that would be great.p  pIf I use Futures, dont I need to use await or get to block and wait for the replyp  pIn my use case, regardless of actors, would it end up just feeling like Im making 1000 sequential database requestsp  pIf code snips are useful in helping me understand this, Java would be prefered as I am still coming up to speed on scala syntax  but a nice clear textual explanation of how these millions of threads can interoperate on a single processor machine while doing database IO would be fine too.p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 930 pHey there programming peps I have a question re jQuery. We have a software application that is producing a very large HTML report... large on the order of 5002000 printed pages. It can take Google Chrome between 1220 seconds to load it from the hard drive. p  pThere is a some JavaScript in use which serves only to give the HTML version of the report some additional functionality. Right now, all of the events are fired off from inline HTML codeonclickcodes and so on. p  pIf I convert to jQuery and use selectors to bind the events, the selectors could easily be matching 10s of thousands of elements. Plus, the typical way to use jQuery eg., codedocument.readycode would cause the click event not to fire until the document was fully loaded. p  pstrongSo the questions arestrong  Is jQuery up to this task Or am I better suited leaving inline script If it is, are there certain techniques I need to use to make it work well  And is there a way to circumvent the no events until document load scenariop  pstrongAnd a secondary questionstrong emthis one just occurred to me as I was writing thisem This report is being sold to a client. What are my license obligations if jQuery is included as apart of the reportp  pemstrongEditemstrongp  pjfriend00  Ive been at a bit of a loss on how to do this split the report up. The report is issued in 2 formats HTML and PDF. The clients want to have a digital manual available from which they can print sections. They also want the HTML version because it provides anchors which link key parts. The JavaScript allows for a popup that provides a view into the underlying data that the report was based on. What has happened is that weve run into a scaling problem. The data being analyzed has increased greatly and so has the size of the resulting report. p  pFor confidentially reasons, the report cannot be live online nor on an internal intranet. It has to be a deliverable that will run on an individuals local machine. p  pIf anyone has tips on how to handle this gracefully, I would love to hear your ideas.

Negative 930 pIm using VS2010,C to develop my ASP.NET web app, sometimes I need to declare public or even public static variable at start of my codebehind files, so that I can access them globally in the file and also they preserve their value between postbacks, everything works fine on my local server as Im the only person who runs the code. But I dont know exactly what happens when this page and therefor its codebehind are run by several web site visitors at the same time, I want my program to run the same for all users, but I think in this way something will cause problems, I can remember from my previous ASP.NET experience that using variable public or public static in codebehind can cause misunderstanding for different users of web site, for instance user A runs program, public static int myint that had the value of 1 at startup has taken value of 100, and at this time user B runs the same page, so myint is 100 and it will cause problems, also suppose that user A leaves the page while myint has value of 100, then user B will visit the page myint would be initially 100 while that should be 1 so I think unexpected behaviors would occurp  pis it right will this happen at all if so, how can I prevent it should I use session instead of variables how can I have a better understanding about the whole situationp  pthanks friendsp

Negative 930 pThe Zen of Python states that there should only be one way to do things yet frequently I run into the problem of deciding when to use a function versus when to use a method.p  pLets take a trivial example a ChessBoard object. Lets say we need some way to get all the legal King moves available on the board. Do we write ChessBoard.getkingmoves or getkingmoveschessboardp  pHere are some related questions I looked atp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq2657627577199Why does python use 39magic methods39ali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq237128577199Is there a reason Python strings don39t have a string length methodali ul  pThe answers I got were largely inconclusivep  blockquote   h3Why does Python use methods for some functionality e.g. list.index but functions for other e.g. lenlisth3      pThe major reason is history. Functions were used for those operations that were generic for a group of types and which were   intended to work even for objects that didnt have methods at all   e.g. tuples. It is also convenient to have a function that can   readily be applied to an amorphous collection of objects when you use   the functional features of Python map, apply et al.p      pIn fact, implementing len, max, min as a builtin function is actually less code than implementing them as methods for each type.   One can quibble about individual cases but its a part of Python, and   its too late to make such fundamental changes now. The functions have   to remain to avoid massive code breakage.p blockquote  pWhile interesting, the above doesnt really say much as to what strategy to adopt.p  blockquote   pThis is one of the reasons  with custom methods, developers would be   free to choose a different method name, like getLength, length,   getlength or whatsoever. Python enforces strict naming so that the   common function len can be used.p blockquote  pSlightly more interesting. My take is that functions are in a sense, the Pythonic version of interfaces.p  pLastly, a hrefhttpmail.python.orgpipermailpythondev2008January076612.htmlfrom Guido himselfap  blockquote   blockquote     pemTalking about the AbilitiesInterfaces made me think about some of our     rogue special method names.  In the Language Reference, it says, A     class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special     syntax such as arithmetic operations or subscripting and slicing by     defining methods with special names.  But there are all these methods     with special names like codelencode or codeunicodecode which seem to be     provided for the benefit of builtin functions, rather than for     support of syntax.  Presumably in an interfacebased Python, these     methods would turn into regularlynamed methods on an ABC, so that     codelencode would becomeemp  precodeclass container   ...   def lenself     raise NotImplemented codepre          pemThough, thinking about it some more, I dont see whyem all emsyntactic     operations wouldnt just invoke the appropriate normallynamed method     on a specific ABC.  codeltcode, for instance, would presumably invoke     codeobject.lessthancode or perhaps codecomparable.lessthancode.  So another     benefit would be the ability to wean Python away from this     mangledname oddness, which seems to me an HCI improvementem.p   blockquote      pHm. Im not sure I agree figure that .p      pThere are two bits of Python rationale that Id like to explain   first.p      pFirst of all, I chose lenx over x.len for HCI reasons codedef   lencode came much later. There are two intertwined reasons actually, both HCIp      pa For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than   postfix  prefix and infix operations have a long tradition in   mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the   mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which we   rewrite a formula like codexabcode into codexa  xbcode to the clumsiness of   doing the same thing using a raw OO notation.p      pb When I read code that says codelenxcode I emknowem that it is asking for   the length of something. This tells me two things the result is an   integer, and the argument is some kind of container. To the contrary,   when I read codex.lencode, I have to already know that codexcode is some kind of   container implementing an interface or inheriting from a class that   has a standard codelencode. Witness the confusion we occasionally have when   a class that is not implementing a mapping has a codegetcode or codekeyscode   method, or something that isnt a file has a codewritecode method.p      pSaying the same thing in another way, I see len as a builtin   emoperationem. Id hate to lose that. I cant say for sure whether you meant that or not, but def lenself ... certainly sounds like you   want to demote it to an ordinary method. Im strongly 1 on that.p      pThe second bit of Python rationale I promised to explain is the reason   why I chose special methods to look codespecialcode and not merely   codespecialcode. I was anticipating lots of operations that classes might want   to override, some standard e.g. codeaddcode or codegetitemcode, some not so   standard e.g. pickles codereducecode for a long time had no support in C   code at all. I didnt want these special operations to use ordinary   method names, because then preexisting classes, or classes written by   users without an encyclopedic memory for all the special methods,   would be liable to accidentally define operations they didnt mean to   implement, with possibly disastrous consequences. Ivan Krsti   explained this more concise in his message, which arrived after Id   written all this up.p      p    Guido van Rossum home page a hrefhttpwww.python.orgguidohttpwww.python.orgguidoap blockquote  pMy understanding of this is that in certain cases, prefix notation just makes more sense ie, Duck.quack makes more sense than quackDuck from a linguistic standpoint. and again, the functions allow for interfaces.p  pIn such a case, my guess would be to implement getkingmoves based solely on Guidos first point. But that still leaves a lot of open questions regarding say, implementing a stack and queue class with similar push and pop methods should they be functions or methods here I would guess functions, because I really want to signal a pushpop interfacep  pTLDR Can someone explain what the strategy for deciding when to use functions vs. methods should bep

Negative 930 pIve been looking for this question and couldnt find any, sorry if its duplicated.p  pIm building some kind of ecommerce site, similar to ebay. The problem i have arise when im trying to browse through categories and filters. For example. You can browse the Monitor category. That will show you lots of monitors, and some filters exactly the same as ebay to apply them. So, you go to monitors, then you have filters likep  ul liType LCD  LED  CRTli liBrand ViewSonic  LG  Samsungli liMax Resolution 800x600  1024x768li ul  pAnd those filters will be appended to the URL, following with the example, when you browse monitors the URL could be something likep  precodestore.commonitors codepre  pIf you apply the Type filterp  precodestore.commonitorsLCD codepre  pBrandp  precodestore.commonitorsLCDLG codepre  pMax Resolutionp  precodestore.commonitorsLCDLG1024x768 codepre  pSo, summarizing, the URL structure would be something likep  precodecategoryfilter1filter2filter3 codepre  pI cant figure out how to do it really. The problem is that filters can be variable. I think in the view will need to use codekwargscode but im not really sure.p  pDo you have any idea how to capture that kind of parametersp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 930 pI am having trouble with a query on a form I am working on in a development environment with Windows 7, WAMP 2.2, MySQL 5.5.16, Apache 2.2.21, amp PHP 5.3.8.

Thank you all very much.p  pQuestion 1  The database.php contains the only object class MySQLDataBase I refer to in this form and when I try to submit the form data it inserts it into the database, however the mysqlquery function returns false instead of true, which is what it should be doing.  Ive been doing a TON of research on this and cannot figure out where my syntax is bad nor any other thing that could be wrong.  Any help would be greatly appreciated and any tips as well.  Im a moderatelevel PHP programmer and have a lot more to learn.  I was told to come here for advice.p  pQuestion 2  If you take care to notice in the database.php, under class MySQLDatabase, there is an instance function called query.  When I try to use that with the static function registeruser in user.php it says MySQL Query failed No Database Selected, when it is obviously selected because the constructor is run in the datbase.php file that declares it.  So if I write Userregisteruserusername, password, email, it will return the MySQL Query Failed No Database Selected error.  If anyone would be graceful enough to help me out I would appreciate it very much so.p  pHere is the form, register.php, that is causing issuesp  precodeltphp requireonce....includesinitialize.php  fissetPOST[register] username  POST[username] password  POST[password] email  POST[email] message   errors  0  ifemptyusername     errors     message  Please enter your username. . ltbr gt  if emptypassword     errors     message .

Negative 930 pIm writing a php application that will store STUDENT data in a MySQL relational database. Im trying to find the best waydatatype to store a month and year together without the day.

Ideally, I do not want to store a day, because the day will not always be the same and would require changing php source code if the day changed in the future.p  pJust for more background info, Im storing a STUDENTs INTENTTOGRAD. The client seems to only want this information as a reference or a visual for a report as opposed to using it for data manipulation.

I want to know why....I uinderstand your answers but then I saw thisp  precodepublic abstract class RequestHandlerltTRequest, TResponsegt  RequestHandler, IRequestHandlerltTRequestgt, IRequestHandler, IDisposable, ITypedRequestHandler     where TRequest  globalAgatha.Common.Request     where TResponse  globalAgatha.Common.Response, new      protected RequestHandler      public virtual void AfterHandleTRequest request     public virtual void BeforeHandleTRequest request     public override Response CreateDefaultResponse     public TResponse CreateTypedResponse     public override Response HandleRequest request     public abstract Response HandleTRequest request  codepre  pThe above doesnt cause the compiler to complain...p

Negative 930 pIm developing a client and a server file transfer application with C sockets over UDP SOCKDGRAM. For a PUT method, I have the following execution after handshaking p  pcodeclientcodep  precodeSend a packet if timeout     send the packet again else  ack received     send a new packet codepre  pcodeservercodep  precodewait for the first packet send acknowledge whileEOF     Get a packet     Send an ack codepre  pWhere EOF is basically checking if Ive received the whole file by comparing to a file size that I send during handshake. p  pPackets can be lost at any point during this exchange. The client can send a data packet that gets lost. Itll time out waiting for an ACK and will resend the packet. The server receives a data packet and sends an ACK. That ACK can be lost, at which point the client times out and resends his data packet. Since these packets have a numbered sequence, we can just disregard packet weve received multiple times. p  pMy confusion occurs at the end of the file transfer. The client just sent the packet containing the last bits of the file. The server successfully receives it and sends his ACK. This packet gets lost. The server application is now outside of the while loop because hes written the last bits to the file and, from his point of view the file transfer was successful. However, the client never received the ACK and so times out and resends the data packet. What should happen here The server is not listening or is listening for a new request, not data. At which point should the client or server consider the transfer complete and stop trying to communicate p

In the solution below we use two semaphores, fillCount and emptyCount, to solve the problem. fillCount is the number of items to be read in the buffer, and emptyCount is the number of available spaces in the buffer where items could be written. fillCount is incremented and emptyCount decremented when a new item has been put into the buffer. If the producer tries to decrement emptyCount while its value is zero, the producer is put to sleep. The next time an item is consumed, emptyCount is incremented and the producer wakes up. The consumer works analogously.p

So by adding the codecheckCountercode I was hoping this would skip past the toggle function on page load.p  pOn page load I am using another web service call to call the values of the checkbox at present, for intsance if in the database the value is  to 1, then the checkbox should be checked on the form p  precodevoid SettingsLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      cosainWebService.Service1SoapClient     client.callFlagsCompleted  new EventHandlerltcallFlagsCompletedEventArgsgtclientcallFlagsCompleted     client.callFlagsAsync  codepre  pSo I then take the result of callFlags and use it herep  precodevoid clientcallFlagsCompletedobject sender, callFlagsCompletedEventArgs e                  string flag  System.Convert.ToStringe.Result      foreach string x in e.Result              string[] array  x.Split,          if array[1]  Checkbox Name                        if array[0]  1 this is the value in the database                              checkBox1.IsChecked  true                          else                                           codepre  pThe checkbox XAML looks likep  precodeltCheckBox ContentCheckBox Name Height16 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin12,42,0,0 NamecheckBox1 VerticalAlignmentTop CheckedcheckBox1Checked UncheckedcheckBox1Uncheckedgt codepre  pSo when debugging, clicking the checkbox is toggling the value in the database, so when a user has checked the box, the value should be stored as 1, I should then be able to close the window, load it up again, and the box should be ticked, but for some reason this is not working, and when the window opens, it is toggling the value.

Negative 930 pI want to have clipped drawing on my codeCGContextcode but I need it just the other way round, i.e. I want to add several rectangles to my clipping path using codeCGContextAddRectcode and the clipping should be done in the way that all the rectangles that I have added to my clipping path stay unaffected by any drawing operations. Normally, its just the other way round, i.e. drawing functions draw to the rectangles that have been added to the clipping path and leave the areas that havent been added to the clipping path unaffected. So I guess what I need is just a way to reverse the clipping path before calling codeCGContextClipcode. Back in the QuickDraw days, this could by easily done by using regions and then calling codeXorRgncode for every rectangle. But with Quartz it seems to be more complicated. Does anyone have an easy solution for achieving this or do I need to do all these path reversing calculations on my own   p

Negative 930 pUsing visual studio C 2010. p  pCurrently in a window in MFC code I have a grid. I want the grid to become smaller if I resize the window drag the corners manually, but as I resize the window the grid actually is completely static, so e.g. resizing the window to a very small size will cause the edges of the grid to become outside of the windows visibility. p  pI noticed that the other objects within this window notably, the MFC buttons I have such as cancel do scale with the window and dont go out of sight when I resize the window to a smaller size. They follow the windows edges as if they were given smart relative coordinates instead of absolute coordinates that my grid follows. p  pCurrently I am using the grid here a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles8MFCGridcontrol227 relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles8MFCGridcontrol227a although I highly suspect it is not the source of the problem there is an example code that uses it, and the resize behaves as expected I cannot compile it but I ran the exe example.

Needless to say the view calling a method on the controller is rather smelly.p  precodesettings.Columns.Addcolumn gt                                                      column.Caption                               column.SetDataItemTemplateContentc gt                                                                                                                                              ViewContext.Writer.Write                                                                             Html.ActionLinkEdit, Edit, new id  DataBinder.Evalc.DataItem, Id  ampnbsp                                                                              Html.ActionLinkDelete, Delete, new id  DataBinder.Evalc.DataItem, Id,                                                                                             new onclick  return confirmDo you really want to delete this record [Just say no]                                                                                                                                                                               column.SetHeaderTemplateContentc gt ViewContext.Writer.WriteHtml.ActionLinkNew, Create                             column.Settings.AllowDragDrop  DefaultBoolean.False                             column.Settings.AllowSort  DefaultBoolean.False                             column.Width  70                          settings.Columns.AddRefNum, Emp.

Negative 930 pI am working on a Tower Defense game and am running into a huge problem when it comes to fixating the health of stronger mobs as levels increase.

Negative 930 pIve run into a specific problem and thought of an solution. But since the solution is pretty involved, I was wondering if others have encountered something similar and could comment on best practises or propose alternatives.p  pThe problem is as follows I have a webapp written in Django which has some screen in which data from multiple tables is collected, grouped and aggregated in time intervals. Its basically a big excel like matrix where we have data aggregated in time intervals on one axis, against resources for the aggregated data per interval on the other axis. It involves many inner and left joins to gather all data, and because of the report like character of the presented data, I use raw sql to query everything together.p  pThe problem is that multiple users can concurrently view amp edit data in these intervals. They can also edit data on finer or coarser granularities than other users working with the same data, but in suboverlapping intervals. Currently, when a user edits some data, a django request is fired, the data is altered, the affected intervals are aggregated amp grouped again and presented back. But because of the volatile nature of this data, other users might have changed something before them. Also groupingaggregating and rerendering the table each time is a very heavy operation depending on amount of data and range of the intervals. This gets worse with concurrent users editting..p  pMy proposed solution Its clear a http requestresponse mechanism is not really ideal for this kind of thing The groupingaggregation is pretty heavyweight, not ideal to do this per request, the concurrency would ideally be channeled amongst users, and feedback should be realtime like googledocs instead of full page refreshes.p  pI was thinking about making a daemon process which reads in emflatem data of interestfrom the dbms on request and caches this in memory. All changes to the data would then occur in memory with a writethrough to the dbms. This daemon channels access to the data through a lock, so the daemon can handle which users can overwrite others changes.p  pThe flat data is aggregated and grouped using python code and only the slices required by the user are returned userdaemon communication would run over websockets. The daemon would provide a subscriberpublisher channel, where users interested in specific slices of data are notified when something changes. This daemon could be implemented using a framework like twisted. But Im not sure an event driven approach would work here, as we want to channel all incomming requests... Maybe these should be put in a queue and be run in a seperate thread Would it be better to have twisted run in a thread next to my scheduler, or should the twisted main loop spin off a thread that works on this queue My understanding is that threading works best for IO, and python heavy code basically blocks other threads. I have both websocketsdbms and processing data, would that workp  pHas anyone done something similar beforep  pThanks in advancep  pKarlp

Negative 930 pIve implemented something similar to consumerproducer problem using a unbounded linked blocking queue. I have the producer putting objects to the queue and consumers taking it. When I tested the program, doubling the amound of thread each trial while still processing the same amount of objects, the time for all trials seems to be constant. Is it suppose to be constant Or more thread means faster processing Not sure if it is my code that is causing the slowness or the synchonization for the shared resource. Any ideasp

Negative 930 pIm trying to write my first crawler by using PHP with cURL library. My aim is to fetch data from one site systematically, which means that the code doesnt follow all hyperlinks on the given site but only specific links.p  pLogic of my code is to go to the main page and get links for several categories and store those in an array. Once its done the crawler goes to those category sites on the page and looks if the category has more than one pages. If so, it stores subpages also in another array. Finally I merge the arrays to get all the links for sites that needs to be crawled and start to fetch required data.p  pI call the below function to start a cURL session and fetch data to a variable, which I pass to a DOM object later and parse it with Xpath. I store cURL totaltime and httpcode in a log file.p  pThe problem is that the crawler runs for 56 minutes then stops and doesnt fetch all required links for subpages. I print content of arrays to check result. I cant see any http error in my log, all sites give a http 200 status code. I cant see any PHP related error even if I turn on PHP debug on my localhost.p  pI assume that the site blocks my crawler after few minutes because of too many requests but Im not sure. Is there any way to get a more detailed debug Do you think that PHP is adequate for this type of activity because I want to use the same mechanism to fetch content from more than 100 other sites later onp  pMy cURL code is as followsp  precodefunction geturlurl      ch  curlinit     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHEADER, 0     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, 1     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCONNECTTIMEOUT, 30     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, url     data  curlexecch     info  curlgetinfoch       logfile  fopencrawler.log,a     echo fwritelogfile,Page  . info[url] .  fetched in  . info[totaltime] .  seconds.

Yes, Sergey, Im having problems accessing the values in the JSON dict.  I have gone through that tutorial prior to posting my query.

Im trying to set each pair as variables for use in the code and cant find the syntax to do that. I want to do something like p  pvar1  request.jsonbodyindex0, var2  request.jsonbodyindex1, and so on.  p  pIn the simplified version above Im sending the string test as JSON data. I can then set a string in my Python code to that string, but how do I parse the parts of the JSON body  variablez  request.jsonbody is the tutorial example equivalent.  Since the tuples contain name and value pairs I thought variables might already be declared in the body and I could use them in my code and send some of the values off to my database.p  pThe reason Im not using a simple submit button is that there are several buttons on the form mentioned each of which will take different pieces of information from the form and activate different pieces of code on the server side for immediate hardware action sending serial commands in this case. Were you trying to suggest that pressing enter in a field will automatically submit the form  Not true, at least not on the system Im using which I have control over in this offline application.   p

Negative 930 pI do a research on Linear Programming and I need to solve a complicated hundreds of variables and constraints problem. There are a lot of ways how to solve LP thats not the problem in a selfstanding solver. However, I need to solve it from C application.  I tried my best to find any way how to solve LP inside C code but the only thing I found and was usable was CPLEX and its .NET Concert library. This looks quite well and actually I use it right now and it works good but the formulation of some large complicated problem is a real nightmare What can be written in AMPL in 10 rows and is understandable for anyone, needs about 200 rows in C.p  pDo you know any library for C that would allow providing the problem model definition in some efficient friendly way  CPLEX accepts LP format, but it can grow to hundreds of megabytes when you try to solve a problem with a lot of variables and then the algorithm runs for ages Or I heard about a possibility to convert AMPL to LP format and then solve it by CPLEX C library but it doesnt sound efficient p  pIn short, I have C project. I need to solve LP problem. I need to solve it very efficiently... All this in some reasonably simple way not hundreds of chaotic lines adding variables and constraints in forcycles etc.p

Negative 930 pim trying to create a module that will be referenced in a simple ASP site, using the Autofac Web Form Integration that has a particular requirement. It should return a string created using a specific set of rules. Those rules are defined by a strategy, different for each Actor. The Actor will be choosed at runtime depending on a value coming from the request. To make things harder, some Actor can have a different and specific implementation of this strategy based on, for example, the country of the request.p  pI have already solved this problem using an abstract and a concrete factory the first to understand which Actor concrete factory use, the second one to determine if i need a specific or a generic actors strategy. The problem is that, having adopted a strongly modular design, i need to use reflection in order to get an indirect reference to the specific actors strategy classotherwise i should have a reference to all the dlls containing all the specific strategy implementations. p  pI would love to avoid this approach, mostly because i would like to use a unique way to dynamically load the required components.p  pIve looked at some of the Autofac possibilities and from what ive understood, i can register different implementations of the same interface and resolve them using a key as explained here a hrefhttpscode.google.compautofacwikiTypedNamedAndKeyedServices relnofollowhttpscode.google.compautofacwikiTypedNamedAndKeyedServicesa. The problem is that i dont know how to resolve them inside my abstract and concrete factories i dont have a reference to the resolver there...and i think that i should avoid it.   p  pSo my questions arep  p1 How can i use Autofac in that scenario What is the best practice surely im missing something HUGEp  p2 Do i have to reconsider all the design of this module I mean, do i still need to use an abstract and a concrete factory p  p3 Can anyone point me to some example or tutorial maybe related to my problemp  pMany thanks for your help, and sorry for the long and notsoclear question.p

Negative 930 pI have a Context object.  Its a complex little character that composes an Auth object, a CurrentNode object, a Graph object, and some others.  The Context object has numerous simple methods such as codeisLoggedIncode and codeisAdmincode, and many more complex ones such as codehasPathToNodecode and codenetPathsToNodecode.  Mostly these methods simply proxy to the attached objects.p  pThe Context object is in my Domain layer, ie. the bottom of my application stack.  It is used by all layer super types including Controller, View and Services.  This seems to be working quite well.p  pSo far I have not needed to make other domain objects dependent on the Context.  My controllers or services have been able to decide if a requested action should go ahead.  Now, however, I have a domain object that is particularly complex and heavily reliant on the logic encapsulated within the Context.p  pI emcanem go ahead and let this domain object depend on its Context, but my question is emshould Iem  The object is in the same layer as the Context, which is good.  The Context is a singleton, but is resettable, so therefore easy enough to test.p  pAccording to Martin Fowlers POEAA discussion on the Service Layer Pattern, logic which is domain logic as opposed to application logicworkflow logic belongs in the domain objects, so that encourages me to go ahead and let the dependency take place.p  pI realise that coupling in general is a something to avoid.  In this case, however, I would be replacing interlayer coupling with intralayer coupling, which I think is an improvement in itself.  Eventually I would make the dependencies injectable, which would further reduce the downside of coupling.p  pIts a reasonably significant departure from my approach so far so I want find out what you think before I make the change.  If I do go ahead with this dependency, I would probably refactor all the work I have done to date and let other domain objects depend on their Context too.p

Negative 930 pI am mapping a legacy database, one table of which maps naturally to an inheritance hierarchy using the codeSINGLETABLEcode mapping using a discriminator column. The problem is that there are a huge number of discriminator values Also, new ones are occasionally added and the app should automatically pick them up in polymorphic queries. From the point of view of my app, I would like to treat the vast majority of these different types identically i.e., just map them to the base class in the inheritance hierarchy. However, for a handful, I would like to map to a specific subclass. The problem is that JPA seems to require that I provide a single specific codeDiscriminatorValuecode on the base class or otherwise it generates a default one.p  pTo be concretep  precodeEntity Tableproducts Inheritancestrategy  InheritanceType.SINGLETABLE DiscriminatorColumnname  producttype DiscriminatorValue anything not specified elsewhere  public class Product      ...     public double calculateMarkup  ... default impl ...

And the selected Tab would be the one influencing displayTextArea.  p  pWhen there are two TabPanes I would want the Tab whos Content Node currently has focus, say a TextField or form where the user is entering data that will affect the text of displayTextArea. The way it would look from a users perspective is they will be clicking through the open Tabs in both the TabPanes and the last one they clicked on would be influencing displayTextArea. But that is where I am running into a wall.  p  pAttempted and Failed Approaches  p  ol lipSetup some kind of listener to be notified of a change in focus from one of the Tabs content Node into another Tabs content Node, regardless of which TabPane they are in, then update the displayTextArea accordingly.  There is no AddFocusListener method and I am unsure how to work with the available focus oriented methods and functionality to achieve this behavior.  pli lipForce only 1 Tab to be selected at any one time between multiple TabPanes and stick with the aforementioned OnSelectionChanged EventHandler approach.  I dont know where to start on this one and I have not been able to find anything on it.  pli ol  pIn this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15646724javafxsetfocusaftertabpainechangequestiona there is the topic of changing focus into a TextField object in the Tabs Content Node but I was unable to grab anything useful for my purpose from that post.  p  pI am lost here and dont know how to implement the necessary functionality for this display.p

Negative 930 pI work for a workers comp insurance provider.  About 10 years ago, the company probably had 2030 employees.  Around that time, they built a bunch of databases using ms access because it was quick and easy.  Today, the company has close to 200 employees and were still using ms access for all of our frontends.  We have switched the back ends to sql server.  Needless to say, we frequently experience difficulties with so many people using the access front ends at the same time.p  pMy question is, whats a better frontend entry system for our company  Should I learn ASP.net and build web based front endsp
Negative 930 pIm newbie to jbehave, and I plan to use it with thucydidesselenium. Among the tests Id like to design, there is a step, that will have no input parameter, but will return some value, to be used in further parameterized steps. However, i dont see the way to obtain the parameter from one of steps and use it as input parameter in others. p  pI know, that in the class where the steps are defined I can define a variable that will be accessible for all Step methods and use it in all steps I want. But it will not be seen by the business people when they will work with textual scenarios.p  pSo, what is the way to do itp  pUpd.p  pSay, in the first test or step Im getting some random value, say, some token. Since the token is random, I cant assert it with someting, but Id like to make this key obtaining as separate step or test due to business requirements.p  pIn the next test or step Id like to use the value of this random token obtained from he first step or test. Id like my business users to see that this value, that is an input data to the second step or test was an output from the second step or test, and here it is. p

Negative 930 pIm currently trying to serialize data that Ive previously loaded via Hibernate. To recover type information I enabled default typing like thisp  pcodeobjectMapper.enableDefaultTypingDefaultTyping.NONCONCRETEANDARRAYS,As.PROPERTYcodep  pI also added identityinfo to my entities via this anotationp  pcodeJsonIdentityInfogenerator  ObjectIdGenerators.IntSequenceGenerator.class, property  idcodep  pHowever when I deserialize codeOneToManycoderelations that I have, deserialization fails because the PersistentBag does not have a session at this point. Because my programm is running without a container I can not fix this issue easily. Im also aware of the fact that there is this hibernatedatatype module for jackson but this doesnt solve the problem I guess that module is primaliry used for respecting the LAZYLOADINGhibernateproperty. p  pSo my idea to fix this was to not serialize a codePersistentBagcode but an codeArrayListcode instead. Is there an easy way to do this or do I have to write my own serializer which I tried but without beeing successfulp

Negative 930 pI want to implement some URL rewriting using a Servlet Filter, similar to what the well known Tuckeys URLrewritefilter.

In case of a forward, all the below filters are not processed, because they have the default dispatchers mapping codeDispatcherType.REQUESTcode only. And this is correct, they dont need to run on each and every forward to all of my JSP, etc. I just want them to process an incoming request once. I know I could just add codeltdispatchergtREQUESTltdispatchergtltdispatchergtFORWARDltdispatchergtcode to every of the 20 following filters, but that doesnt feel right.p  pI tried to trick the container, by wrapping the request and overwriting the codegetDispatcherTypecode method to return codeDispatcherType.REQUESTcode instead of codeFORWARDcode. But that doesnt work.p  pI bet Tuckeys implementation has the same problem, because its also using forwards.p  pIs there any nice way around this Any ideasp

Negative 930 pI am currently working on watermarking audio files in Matlab for a mathematics research project. So far I have been able to read wav files using wavread in Matlab. However, because wav files are very large, the resulting data is also large. Therefore, in order to simplify this I would like to know how I would be able to read an mp3 file in Matlab. So far I have only tried to read an mp3 by using dsp.AudioFileReader. However, the resulting data only contains 0s and a few other numbers, which is clearly not the correct data. Would someone please be able to help me Thank you so muchp

Negative 930 pFirst of all, I am very new to web programming in general.  Ive read lots of tutorials online and its a little confusing since some of them are outdated.  So if Im heading down a path that is fundamentally wrong, Id love suggestions about The Right Way.  Having said that, this is just a forfun project, so if there is a simple lt10 lines way to get what I want, Id love to see quick results today even if longterm I end up fundamentally changing things.p  pSo anyway, Im using Google App Engine Python 2.7 to do a simple calculation.  I show a form, the user fills in values, clicks a button at the bottom, and some result text is displayed with the result of the calculation.  This part is working fine.p  pFor my own testing, its annoying to always retype the input values, and some of the fields arent totally obvious to users, so Id like to be able to send a link to someone off the form a hrefhttpbuggyapp.appspot.comcalculationinput1100ampinput2200 relnofollowhttpbuggyapp.appspot.comcalculationinput1100ampinput2200a and have it fill in those two parameters.  This part works, too.p  pThe problem is when the user loads that sort of link, changes one of the values in the form, and then clicks the button.  Instead of using the changed form value, it uses the value in the URL.  Id like to fix that, and ideally Id like the URL bar to not even show the URL Params after the page loads.p  pIm not sure what info is necessary to help you find what Im doing wrong.p  pHeres a section from the HTML, which is a Jinja2 templatep  precodeltform methodpostgt   ltinput value input1  nameinput1gt   ltinput value input2  nameinput2gt   ltbutton classsubmit typesubmitgtCalculateltbuttongt ltformgt ltpgt result ltpgt codepre  pHeres the python codep  precodedef getself   input1  request.getinput1   input2  request.getinput2     some irrelevant code to set default values on the initial load if there are no URL Params    result  strinput1input2 actual calculation slightly more complicated than this   template  JINJAENVIRONMENT.gettemplatecalculation.html   self.response.writetemplate.rendervars codepre  pIt seems to behave the same no matter whether I put the calculation in the get handler or post handler.  At the moment, Im simply calling one from the otherp  precodedef postself   input1  request.getinput1   print input1  even this shows the URL value if one exists, not form value   return self.get codepre  pSo, emmyem next step to make it work would be to change the names of the form inputs so they are different from the URL Params, and add extra code to merge the potential input sources.  But that wont really get me what I want, which is for the URL Params to disappear once they have populated the input forms.  It also complicates the part of the code that generates those sorts of links.p  pId prefer a Pythononly solution, but Im open to using javascript.  There are other stack overflow questionsanswers that imply a javascript mechanism will do what I want, but I dont understand any of them well enough to apply them to my problem.p  pIm sure Im doing lots of other things wrong, and I may have oversimplified things or not posted enough info.  Im here to learn, so fire away.  And thanks in advance for the help.p  ptldr How do I use the URL Params once and then remove them from the URL so they dont override form inputs on subsequent postsp

Negative 930 pIm adding a Navigation Drawer to this app that I am developing and I have scoured the internet forums, stackoverflow, android developer documentation, and still have not found a great answer for this. p  pI know that it is possible to do this without using either of these things. What I am wondering is how. The NsMenuAdapter model uses a title, and then there are these functions p  precodegetActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue getActionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue codepre  pWhich are clearly looking for an action bar. I tried a couple of models that didnt work, the big one I just got done trying is located here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16874826howtoaddiconsadjacenttotitlesforandroidnavigationdrawerHow to Add icons adjacent to titles for Android Navigation Drawera which is related to the link I have below, the project is from gitHub here a hrefhttpsgithub.comgabrielemariottiandroiddevtreemasterNavigationDrawer relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgabrielemariottiandroiddevtreemasterNavigationDrawera. Now the key thing is, I am using a custom layout i.e. Relative Layouts mixed in with Linear Layouts and Im really lost on what my next step should be in order to get this to work. p  pSidenote When I only have the ListView in my mainactivity.xml the implementation for the Navigation Drawer it does properly slide out like it is suppose to. But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to populate it with data. I basically need 3 headers with that will have clickable navigation elements in them, with icons next to the elements. p  pI turned to this model for most of my insight on how to do this via Relative Layouts a hrefhttpgmariotti.blogspot.com201305creatingnavigationdrawer.html relnofollowhttpgmariotti.blogspot.com201305creatingnavigationdrawer.htmla But they use actiontitle bars which is what is really throwing me for a loop. p

Negative 930 pIm developing an application with a menu which contains a list of buttons, when you click one of these buttons, another activity the same activity with different image for each button is opened showing an imageview. The problem is that when i click several times in different buttons opening new images the app crashes and im not able to solve it. Any help Thanks.p
Negative 930 pIs there a way to receive if a key has just been pressed not held in SFML, or a way to mimic such an effectp  pI poll my event here,p  precodewhile window.pollEventevent codepre  pAnd then later in the loop, out of scope but with the same event, I readp  precodeif event.type  sfEventKeyPressed      if event.key.code  sfKeyboardUp              decision         if decision lt 0         decision  CHARACTERMAX  1       codepre  pThis makes codedecisioncode decrement continuously when the up arrow is held down. Using codesfeventcodes, can I read the first time it is pressed and not when it is held downp  pAlso, if its not possible or youre not familiar with sfml, what would be the best way to mimic such with little or no globalized variables such as codeisalreadyheldcode, e.g. a hrefhttpgamedev.stackexchange.comquestions30826actionbuttononlytrueonceperpresshttpgamedev.stackexchange.comquestions30826actionbuttononlytrueonceperpressap  pI realize that such may be the only way declaring a variable in a wider scope but I would prefer not to, because I exit the scope continuously and try to steer clear from global variables as often as possible.p
Negative 930 pIm in the process of programming a java rpg game, and have reached an impass. My code currently has sprite animation, a random map generation with perlin noise and collision detection. The map is tiled base, so im currently trying to convert the perlin noise to tiles. The perlin functions generate a array, and im each number of that array to a tile png. This is where the problem comes RUNTIME ERROR Java.Lang.NullPointerException. The probleme is my compiler netbeans does not show me where the error occurs, but instead only gives me this error code. With a process of exclusion I managed to locate the error, which occurs at line 364. If this site doesnt support lines, it is at the loadTile method, at ifperlinIsland[x][y] lt 0.05blockImg[x][y]  TILE[0]. I believe all the variables are correctly initialized, but I cant manage to find a solution. Please excuse the long code, but I included everything for the sake of information.

Negative 930 pWe are using MySQL .NET Connector 6.7.4 to access a MySQL database using Entity Framework 5.0 in .NET. After upgrading to version 6.7.4 we have started to run into problems with a timestamp column where NULL is allowed. We can save values without problems i.e. the column gets updated properly in the db but whenever we retrieve the entity corresponding to the row in the database the property corresponding to that column always returns null. We have tried to change the precision of the column in the edmxfile but that didnt change the behavior at all. Has anyone else experienced this issue Is there any known workaround, besides downgrading to an older version of MySQL .NET Connectorp

Negative 930 pAlright I have a application where users can create collections and once they create a collection they can create products to that collection. So each collection has many products and each product belongs to a collection. On the Collections view and on the Products view the links work great. For clarifying the products are getting associated through a collectionid that is tied to them to tell them which collection they belong to. My usual method which works for the products controller and collections controller is thisp  precodedef show   collection  Collection.findparams[collectionid]   design  collection.designs.all end codepre  pThe problem Im having is on a static page...lets call it the home page. On this page Im listing ALL of the products. if you click on a product it takes you to the corresponding product page through the collections ie localhostcollections2products5....those numbers relate to the ids of the collections and products.p  pIm using the same links I use in the Collection and Product views which isp  precodelinkto collectiondesignpathcollection, design codepre  pLike I mentioned these links work great for the collection and product views. Here is my staticpagescontroller for the home pagep  precodedef home   design  Design.all end codepre  pIt shows all of the designs but the links look like this p  precodelocalhostcollectionsdesigns3  codepre  pIts skipping over the collections id. Does anyone have a solution to this Ive asked this question before but the answers were all incorrect unfortunately. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pDesigns and Products are the same thing. I scaffolded with the name designs so im using that but they are basically products...in case that confuses anyone readingp  pstrongEDITstrong Here is the routes filep  precoderesources collections do   resources designs do     member do       post like       post unlike     end   end end codepre  pyou can ignore the like and unlike..thats just for liking and unliking productsdesigns..the routes file shows you how the designs are nested in the collection linkp

Negative 930 pIm developing a system which consists of a few componentsp  ol listrongRESTful servicesstrong  public API that has to be accessible from mobile devices. ASP.NET Web API li listrongASP.NET MVC 4 Web sitestrong, that also uses the services. li listrongMobile appstrong.li ol  pSiteapp users should be able to login there using their Facebook account. My current understanding of the process is the followingp  ol lipThe siteapp makes request to Facebook to get access token. Once user confirms to pass hisher details to my application my siteapp receives the authentication token.pli lipThe siteapp passes the token to my RESTful APIpli lipAPI validates the token by sending a request to facebook with the secret. Then the user can be createdauthenticated, api generates access token for the user. I do not see any reason to make requests each time user tries to access API.pli ol  pIm thinking about best way to implement this. ASP.NET MVC 4 has OAuth support outofthe box, but it works only if you do everything inside MVC application. DotNetOpenAuth has built in FacebookClient class, but it assumes the same think.

Negative 930 pIm writing a web app that uses the Leap Motion as a controller through javascript.  My problem is that when I go to do selenium testing, even if the Leap device is disconnected, the controller keeps grabbing empty frames.  This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to simulate leap pointables and gestures properly because half the time its reading no pointables herep  pI really dont want to add a testing scenario or iftesting to the application  the point is to test the code that will run at release, not a special case.  If I could just disable the leap controller from selenium, feed in fakegenerated frames, and then only run my own functions, that would be best.  Ive been combing through the leap documentation, and I havent found anything that legitimately stops the controller from reading frames.  Anyone have any ideasp

Negative 930 pI have been automating my C code with Doxygen for a long time, and find the HTML output great for understanding the code.  However, I have a new requirement to generate Word .docx files containing the same information, but with very particular formatting requirements.p  pUsing the pythondocx package, writing a .docx file, and configuring the styles to match my requirements is pretty straightforward, parsing Doxygens XML outputs with LXML.  However, for the more complex fields e.g. detailed description of files and functions, there is fairly complex documentstyle XML markup.p  pMy understanding is there can be an arbitrary nesting of codeltparagtcode, codeltitemizedlistgtcode, codeltxrefsectgtcode and other tags with freestanding text tails trailing them at the same level.  My approach to converting from nested XML to flat .docx paragraphs and bulleted lists has been to employ a statemachine, but this seems fragile since there could be an arbitrary number of nesting levels.p  pMy current strategy is a hrefhttpsgist.github.comsuperlou6990947 relnofollowin a gist herea.  I was wondering if there is a more general way of understanding documents with complex nesting. Is there a less fragile tactic than my statemachine  Im not sure if Im trying to reinvent the wheel, but the more cases I add to the statemachine, the less it feels like a robust solution.p

Negative 930 pIm using a UIKit dynamics for animating a UIView. As the codeUIViewcode is dragged responding to physics and whatnot, the background view its superview needs to fade out and some codeUILabelcode needs to fade in. So far, Ive gotten away with doing this by adding a block to the appropriate codeUIDynamicBehaviorcode and manually go about decreasing the superviews alpha and increasing the codeUILabelscode alpha. This works fine as long as I want a linear crossfade, that is superview1  a  labela. But actually, my animation needs to be a bit more involved. Something along the lines ofp  ol liThe superview starts fading out, say up to .2 alphali liAt this point the label starts fading in at a greater pace different timing function if you will.li liAt the end of the animation, the superview is at alpha  0 and the label at alpha  1.li ol  pSure, I could just compute this into a formula and manually update the alpha values according to that. But I was wondering if there is a way I could create a CA animation group or CATransaction with a few animations, apply this to the appropriate layers and then step thru the frames in the action block of the dynamic behavior. p  pFor instance, the codeCAMediaTimingcode protocol has codetimeOffsetcode which can be used to start the animation offset in time. Im thinking something similar but that would essentially keep the animation paused at all times and I could just tell it to jump to interpolate a specific point in time. Im not sure, however, if there is any such property like codetimeOffsetcode or way to do it.p

Negative 930 pMy program is designed to search Amazon and extract bits of data from the results  such as product name and price.p  pSo far, my program pastes what the user has typed into codetxtSearchcode and presses Go on the page. Here is the code so farp  precode    Private Sub btnSearchClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnSearch.Click     Dim SearchTerm As String      Set SearchTerm as text input     SearchTerm  txtSearch.Text      Identify the search text box     Dim AmazonElementCollection As HtmlElementCollection  webBrowser.Document.GetElementsByTagNameInput     For Each curElement As HtmlElement In AmazonElementCollection         Dim searchtextbox As String  curElement.GetAttributeid.ToString         If searchtextbox  twotabsearchtextbox Then             Populate the search text box             curElement.SetAttributeValue, searchterm         End If     Next      BUTTON CLICK Search button     ltinput typesubmit valueGo classnavsubmitinput titleGogt     For Each curElement As HtmlElement In AmazonElementCollection         Find the Go button         If curElement.GetAttributevalue.EqualsGo Then             Function to click the button             curElement.InvokeMemberclick         End If     Next codepre  pSo this all works fine as it does all this on a web browser object called codewebBrowsercode. But how do I take the text off the web page for the first result for example and put it into a textbox. I would like the title of the first result to be put into a textbox called codetxtTitlecode. Thank you.p

The problem Im running in to is that I had to rewrite a lot of the same lines of code over and over. I understand functions somewhat but not OOP. Im thinking there is a better OOP way of writing this code but I cant get my head around it. Any pointers will be greatly appreciated.

Negative 930 pIt is possible to call an Android Cfunction from Delphi via a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20982789wheredoesdelphiandroidsearchforanativelanguagelibraryJNI and NDKa.

Examining the adb output see below it appears that the file codelibDLLTestProject.socode is expected.

That did not help. p  pDoes anyone understand why the Delphi generated app tries to load a library of itself And better any suggestion how I should call an Android Cfunction via Delphip  precode  IInputReader  608 Reconfiguring input devices.  changes0x00000010   Ddalvikvm  799 GCFORALLOC freed 2003K, 15 free 14582K16964K, paused 29ms, total 29ms   IPCKeyboard  799 Loaded dictionary, len841005   IHKLatinKeyboardBaseView  799 onMeasure width1200   IHKLatinKeyboardBaseView  799 onMeasure width1200   DDocuments 3358 Used cached roots for com.android.providers.downloads.documents   DDocuments 3358 Used cached roots for com.android.externalstorage.documents   DDocuments 3358 Used cached roots for com.android.providers.media.documents   DDocuments 3358 Used cached roots for com.google.android.apps.docs.storage   DDocuments 3358 Update found 7 roots in 28ms   DBackupManagerService  608 Received broadcast Intent  actandroid.intent.action.PACKAGEADDED datpackagecom.embarcadero.DLLTestProject flg0x4000010 has extras    VBackupManagerService  608 addPackageParticipantsLocked 1   DSystemBroadcastService  987 Received broadcast actionandroid.intent.action.PACKAGEADDED and uri   WContextImpl  987 Implicit intents with startService are not safe Intent  actcom.google.android.gms.games.service.INTENT  android.content.ContextWrapper.startService494 com.google.android.gms.games.service.GamesIntentService.a101 com.google.android.gms.games.service.GamesIntentService.b368   IActivityManager  608 Delay finish com.android.vendingcom.google.android.finsky.receivers.PackageMonitorReceiverRegisteredReceiver   IActivityManager  608 Resuming delayed broadcast   IActivityManager  608 Delay finish com.google.android.apps.plus.service.PackagesMediaMonitor   IActivityManager  608 Resuming delayed broadcast   VGelStubAppWatcher 3631 onReceive android.intent.action.PACKAGEADDED   IIcing.InternalIcingCorporaProvider 3631 Updating corpora A com.embarcadero.DLLTestProject, C MAYBE   IActivityManager  608 START u0 flg0x10800000 cmpcom.estrongs.android.pop.app.InstallMonitorActivity has extras from pid 3466   Ddalvikvm  608 GCEXPLICIT freed 1385K, 11 free 19671K22028K, paused 3ms8ms, total 194ms   Ddalvikvm  608 WAITFORCONCURRENTGC blocked 24ms   DAndroidRuntime 4437 Shutting down VM   Ddalvikvm 4437 GCCONCURRENT freed 95K, 16 free 560K660K, paused 0ms0ms, total 2ms   WInputMethodManagerService  608 Window already focused, ignoring focus gain of com.android.internal.view.IInputMethodClientStubProxy42c98f48 attributenull, token  android.os.BinderProxy42b91f10   Ddalvikvm 3631 GCCONCURRENT freed 560K, 6 free 10268K10860K, paused 2ms2ms, total 23ms   DAndroidRuntime 4476   DAndroidRuntime 4476 gtgtgtgtgtgt AndroidRuntime START com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit ltltltltltlt   DAndroidRuntime 4476 CheckJNI is OFF   Ddalvikvm 4476 Trying to load lib libjavacore.so 0x0   Ddalvikvm 4476 Added shared lib libjavacore.so 0x0   Ddalvikvm 4476 Trying to load lib libnativehelper.so 0x0   Ddalvikvm 4476 Added shared lib libnativehelper.so 0x0   Ddalvikvm 4476 No JNIOnLoad found in libnativehelper.so 0x0, skipping init   Ddalvikvm 4476 Note class LandroidappActivityManagerNative has 179 unimplemented abstract methods   DAndroidRuntime 4476 Calling main entry com.android.commands.am.Am   IActivityManager  608 START u0 flg0x10000000 cmpcom.embarcadero.DLLTestProjectcom.embarcadero.firemonkey.FMXNativeActivity has extras from pid 4476   Ddalvikvm  608 GCFORALLOC freed 807K, 12 free 19517K22028K, paused 63ms, total 63ms   DAndroidRuntime 4476 Shutting down VM   Ddalvikvm 4476 GCCONCURRENT freed 96K, 15 free 586K684K, paused 0ms0ms, total 2ms   Ddalvikvm 4507 Lateenabling CheckJNI   IActivityManager  608 Start proc com.embarcadero.DLLTestProject for activity com.embarcadero.DLLTestProjectcom.embarcadero.firemonkey.FMXNativeActivity pid4507 uid10113 gids50113, 3003, 1028, 1015   Idalvikvm 4507 Enabling JNI app bug workarounds for target SDK version 9...

Is my understanding rightp  pIf i implement WCF Service   Web Api how the approach will be I read articles and forums thread about this, but i didnt got it clearly.p  pMostly said web api is the best combination and simply include in the controller. But then how the layer is seperated as presentation and service layer Here the service layer Web api  is specifically for the MVC application  web UI only. Not getting generally. p  pI used WCF like Service Layer as one application and Business Layer and Data Layer as class libariries. Here i can host the service in iis and access from anywherer.

When I increase the number of messages, however, it hangs and htop shows VIRT of 138G for the process.p  pHeres the code in questionp  precodepackage main  import nethttp import fmt import time  const      SUCCESS    iota     TOTAL  iota     TIMEOUT  iota     ERROR  iota   type Result struct      successful    int     total         int     timeouts      int     errors        int     duration      time.Duration   func makeRequestsurl string, messages int, resultChan chanlt http.Response      for i  0 i lt messages i          resp,   http.Geturl         if resp  nil              resultChan lt resp                 func deployRequestsurl string, threads int, messages int Result      results  new Result     resultChan  makechan http.Response     start  time.Now     defer func          fmt.Printfsn, time.Sincestart          for i  0 i lt threads i          go makeRequestsurl, messagesthreads  1, resultChan           for response  range resultChan          if response.StatusCode  200              results.errors  1          else              results.successful  1                  results.total  1         if results.total  messages              return results                   return results   func main       results  deployRequestshttpwww.google.com, 10, 1000     fmt.PrintfTotal dn, results.total     fmt.PrintfSuccessful dn, results.successful     fmt.PrintfError dn, results.errors     fmt.PrintfTimeouts dn, results.timeouts     fmt.Printfs, results.duration  codepre  pThere are obviously some things missing or stupidly done no timeout checking, channel is synchronous, etc but I wanted to get the basic case working before fixing those. What is it about the program as written that causes so much memory allocation p  pAs far as I can tell, there are just 10 goroutines. If one is created per HTTP request, which would make sense, how does one perform operations that would create many goroutines in a loop Or is the issue totally unrelated. p
Negative 930 pIve been looking at several different solutions to my table concurrency problems in codeMySQLPHPInnoDBcodep  pI really want Process 2 to wait for Process 1 to commit before starting its own transaction and codeSELECTcodeing data to work on and then trying to INSERT a codeUNIQUE INDEXcode. So, Process 1 locks the table and Process 2 checks for the lock, and waits if a codeWRITE lockcode already exists with something like codesleepcode...  I cannot use semaphores.p  ol lipIs that it  1b. That simple  1c. Should I also still check for a duplicate entry when codeINSERTcodeingpli lipAlso, do I need to check for this single codeWRITE lockcode bEVERYWHERE ELSEb that there are codeUPDATEScode andor codeINSERTScode to the table, or will this be handled automatically by making the codeUPDATEINSERTcode wait This is only done once, so making all other queries wait is the single biggest downside if this is the case.pli ol  pSOLUTION BONUS THOUGHT it would seem simpler to check for a duplicate key error when inserting, and if true, then recodeSELECTcode and recalculate a new value and try again until the codeDUPLICATE KEYcode error is no longer.p

Negative 930 pIm working on an Android NDK app, which uses a number of static libraries.

So far I have worked around this issue by adding the dependency include directories manually to the LOCALCINCLUDES variable, but it feels kind of messy to run up and down the relative paths to the other modules.p  pIt seems like there must be a better way to do this.  I know that the LOCALEXPORTCINCLUDES does work when referencing a static library from my primary shared library  the one loaded by the NativeActivity , but it just doesnt seem to work from static library to static library.p  pAm I just setting this up wrong somehow  Should these modules be able to import each other and get the includes automaticallyp

Negative 930 pEDIT Seriously, whats with the downvotes I thought I described my issue with adequate details and researched this fairly well before posting even if I wasnt able to find the answer on my own.p  pThere is a builtin Arrays class in Java that has some useful methods for arrays, like binarysearch and sort, but for some reason I cant figure out how to call its methods correctly. Im trying to search inside an array for a specific string, and I want to return the index if found, so I tried thisp  precodeint rankID  Arrays.binarysearchcardRanks, myRank codepre  pWhere cardRanks is my array and myRank is my passed in string parameter that I want to search for. I also tried this although I suspect this returns a boolean rather than an integerp  precodeint rankID  Arrays.asListcardRanks.containsmyRank codepre  pWhenever I try any of these I get this same error at compilep  precodeError cannot find symbol symbol   variable Arrays codepre  pThis error is basically telling me that the compiler doesnt recognize Arrays as the class and is treating it like a variable.p  pFrom what I understand there isnt any include type statement in Java, which was my first guess, and so Im assuming that the builtin classes are just included although this would be the source of my trouble if my assumption is wrong. Ive looked up several tutorials on arrays and questions on forums about binarysearch and the Arrays class which is how I found out about the aslist.contains part but  I havent been able to find this answer.p  pWhat am I doing wrong What is the proper way to call the Arrays class methods Is there another way to tell the compiler that I want to use the java.util.Arrays libraryp  pThis is the rest of the code Im using in this particular class, in case the error lies elsewhere in my codep  precodeclass PlayingCards      private static String[] cardRanks  Ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King     private static String[] cardSuits  spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds     private String rank     private String suit      public PlayingCards String myRank, String mySuit          rank  myRank         suit  mySuit         int rankID  Arrays.binarysearchcardRanks, myRank         System.out.printlnRank found and is index   rankID         rank  cardRanks[rankID]         System.out.printlnAssociated rank is   rank            public PlayingCards int myRank, int mySuit          rank  this.cardRanks[myRank]         suit  PlayingCards.cardSuits[mySuit]           public PlayingCards           rank  Ace         suit  spades           public static void mainString[] args          System.out.printlnDraw some cards         PlayingCards card1  new PlayingCardsKing,diamonds         PlayingCards card2  new PlayingCards5,monkeys         PlayingCards card3  new PlayingCards1,0         PlayingCards card4  new PlayingCards          System.out.printlnYour 1st card is a   card1.rank   of   card1.suit  .

System.out.printlnYour 4th card is a   card4.rank   of   card4.suit  .       codepre  pWhen I run this code with the offending lines commented out and just accepting the given rank and suit strings without checking against the array, everything works fine, so I dont think I did anything wrong in my array declarations because I can pull out the correct entry when I use the constructor that looks up rank and suit by array index. Any tips or help would be greatly appreciatedp  pIm actually stepping through the official Java trail tutorials and Ive been looking all over for some kind of examples or indepth explanation of working with arrays but there is almost no information. Maybe this is just a much more advanced topic that isnt intended for beginnersp
Negative 930 pOkay, Im unsure how to word the question, but basically I want to repeat my div containers that have a class of blocks using only javascript, no HTML other than the HTML needed to start a page.

Also as a sidenote if you have a better way as to how I should have worded the question, let me know. Thanks p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTbCYH1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTbCYH1ap

Negative 930 pI have a script that I am writing which relies on functions in an imported module.  This script takes a while due to IO web requests and I would like to parallize it for hundreds of thousands of iterations of a script block.  p  pAfter attempting several different methods with little success due to restrictions with codeStartJobcode and other things the current implementation relies on precreating a pool of powershell shells created via codeshell  [Powershell]Createcode.p  pOne of the module methods I have to call to bootstrap the shell so its in a correct state has a call to codeWriteHostcode in it.  When I call codeshell.Invokecode the following error occursp  blockquote   pWriteHost  A command that prompts the user failed because the host program or the command type does not support user   interaction. Try a host program that supports user interaction, such as the Windows PowerShell Console or Windows   PowerShell ISE, and remove promptrelated commands from command types that do not support user interaction, such as   Windows PowerShell workflows.p blockquote  pNow, since the module is custom I can remove the codeWriteHostcode calls, but that reduces user friendliness when it is run directly by end users.  I can create a codeswitchcode parameter that does not execute WriteHost if the parameter is true, but to do that down the line is a good bit of work feasible, but Id rather not.p  pIs there any way I can get codeWriteHostcode to not error out in this scenario  I dont actually care about the input in this scenario, I just dont want the errors.p

Negative 930 pYesterday I decided I wanted to install PerlMagick to do some scripting on my images. I seem to have broken ImageMagicks delegates and created multiple versions. Im not entirely sure... Im fairly new to linux. I traced back my command paths as best as I could and I will try to guide you along what I did.p  pBefore deciding to install PerlMagick from source, I had version 6.7.7 of ImageMagick and it worked great.  I pretty much followed the instructions here to install PerlMagick.p  pa hrefhttpwww.imagemagick.orgscriptperlmagick.php relnofollowhttpwww.imagemagick.orgscriptperlmagick.phpap  precode        tar xczf ImageMagick.tar.gz         .configure withperl         make         sudo make install codepre  pThe make had an error, stating that I was missing lbperl I think thats what it was. I dont have any output logs. So for whatever reason I thought moving to the imagemagick directory and trying again might fix it.p  precode        cd ImageMagick6.8.95         .configure withperl         make         sudo make install codepre  pMake failed again so I thought moving the imagemagick directory to another directory might fix it.p  precode        mv ImageMagick6.8.95 usrshare         sudo su         perl e use ImageMagick print ImageMagickgtQuantumDepth codepre  pThe test command didnt work. Tried messing around a bit more.p  precode        sudo ldconfig usrlocallib         .configure withperl          sudo make install         cd PerlMagick codepre  pAt this point I realized that there were some errors when I tried to convert a PNG. I think the primary error being that the delegate code for PNG was no longer there.  Tried a bunch of ways to get rid of it so I could reinstall it clean.p  precode        sudo aptget install reinstall imagemagick         sudo aptget remove imagemagick         rm rf ImageMagick6.8.95         sudo aptget install reinstall imagemagick         sudo ldconfig usrlocallib         sudo aptget purge remove imagemagick         sudo aptget install imagemagick         sudo aptget purge remove imagemagick         sudo aptget install imagemagick         sudo aptget install reinstall imagemagick codepre  pAt this point I was pretty frustrated so I asked a senior programmer if he could help me figure it out. He suggested doing the make again with a make uninstall.p  precode        tar xczf ImageMagick.tar.gz         .configure withperl         sudo make uninstall codepre  pDiscovered that PerlMagick doesnt support uninstall. How the heck am I supposed to remove itp  precode        sudo make install          sudo aptget install libperldev         sudo make install codepre  pThe core of the issue for my work purposes comes down to the fact that I cant do anything with PNGs.. so I got the png lib and extracted the tar.

Negative 930 pIm using EF6 with an SQL Server Compact database, CodeFirst approach and MigrateToLatestVersionInitializers. I also have two DbContextderived classes which use the same database. Programming language is C, IDE is Visual Studio 2013.p  pOn application startup, I want to check wether a given databasefile is valid or not. First I check if the file exists, but then I also would like to check if the file is a valid database. p  pMy first approach was to create an instance of each of my DbContextclasses. But as this doesnt access the Database, I cant catch any exceptions that would imply an invalid file.p  pBut also when i call a function that accesses the Database, like codeSomeContextEntities.ToListcode, I Dont get any exceptions, even if the file I check is a simple textdocument. I guess the Initializer simply overwrites the invalid textfile and creates a new database. p  pThen I tried codeSomeContext.Database.Connection.Opencode, hoping that method would throw an exception when the databasefile is invalid, but it doesnt and the ConnectionState simply changes to open. As a matter of fact, when I call codeSomeContext.Database.Connection.Closecode, the formerly textfile has been transformed into an empty databasefile.p  pAlso codeSomeContext.Database.Existscode apparently just checks for fileexistance.p  pIs there a preferably lowcost way to check for a valid databasefilep

Negative 930 pSorry for my bad english, Im doing a project for school where i have to move a vehicle via WiFi with an Android App. I achieved my goal but I got surprised to see that, most of the times when I pressed any button, my vehicle took some time to actually do something. On the other hand, when I press any button a few times quickly, the events stack, and after, even when Im not pressing any button, the vehicle moves. Needless to say, both are several problems. Is there any way to fix them. The Android App conects via REST API to an Arduino Yun. With each touch on a button im making an HTTP Request in order to move the vehicle Forward, Backwards, Left or Right.

Negative 930 pI am trying to write an app that sends a string to a specified IP address and Port number. The destination already has a server that accepts strings, but for some reason, the app cannot establish a socket with the server, it keeps timing out. I have only written code, so if I have to do something else like port forward on either the client or server end, please let me know.p  pThe goal of this app is to take in a string for an IP address, a string for the Port number, and a String for the message to send to the destination. After pressing the Send button, the app will send the message to the IP and Port number defined, and display a response from the server.p  pThis also will be used in two applications once between the Android App and a Python server, and other between the Android App and custom hardware. Hopefully there is a solution to fit both cases.p  pClient Codep  precodepublic static class PlaceholderFragment extends Fragment           TextView recieve         EditText addressText, portText,

Negative 930 pIm using ehcache 2.8.2 migrated from 1.6.2 on a large reporting application. Due to out of memory errors, Im changing the configuration from being bounded by the number of elements maxElementsInMemory to being bounded to heap memory maxBytesLocalHeapmaxBytesLocalDisk on the cacheManager level . Unfortunately, this is not working very well.p  pThe application has around 100 caches one for each report. This makes it convenient to manage the caches separately. However, when using a maxBytes configuration to pool the heap space between the caches, each cache only takes 1100 of the pool. The application would have around 5 or 6 caches in use at a given moment, so this constraint is massively inefficient in our case.p  pWhat we would like to do is to have maxBytesLocalHeap as the limit size of all caches, but each cache could take the amount of memory it needs, without being bounded to 1100 of the size of the pool Perhaps using LRU across caches. Of course, the sum of the size of all caches should be smaller than the pool.p  pIs this possible to do with ehcache What alternatives would you suggest in this casep

Negative 930 pThought I was getting a handle on codeConfigureAwaitcode, then I tried an experiment.p  pMy understanding is that codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode will only make a difference if there is a synchronization context.p  pASP, WPF, etc. should have a context, but console apps and service apps should not.p  pTo see how it works I made a Web API app and included the following methodp  precode GET apivalues5 public async Taskltstringgt Get int id      var syncCtx  SynchronizationContext.Current      int startThreadId  Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId      await Task.DelayTimeSpan.FromSeconds3.ConfigureAwaittrue      int endThreadId  Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId      return Start Thread ID   startThreadId.ToString                End Thread ID   endThreadId.ToString  codepre  pMy prediction was that with no codeConfigureAwaitcode or codeConfigureAwaitcode set to codetruecode, I should see the same thread ID before and after the await.p  pMy first few tests showed exactly that with the true set as above.p  pLater runs of the code started and ended on different thread ids regardless of codeConfigureAwaitcode.p  pI added codesyncCtxcode to convince myself I have a context.p  pThe one caveat I have read is that if the task has completed, you wont be guaranteed the same ID. Is that the case here  If so, why is that the casep  pHave I set up a naive or flawed test If so, what would be a proper testp  pI started down this path in a consoleservice app and realized I was not getting the same thread ID.

Negative 930 pI am working on creating a bash script to automatically place videos in a Plex Library. For shows that ive seen so far, the following regex works fine to detect the show name, season, and episode number.p  precodeTV Show Name sed n s..S[09]1,.1p TV Show Season sed n s.S[09]1,.1p TV Show Episode sed n s.S[09]E[09].1p codepre  pThe real trouble comes when moving the videos to the Plex Library. All the videos that are being placed in folder to be processed by the script use periods . as spaces.p  pFor example, Once.Upon.A.Time.S01E01.avi, Marvels.Agents.Of.S.H.I.E.L.D.S01E01.avi, etcp  pSince the Plex Library format uses underscores  to represent spaces this is on a Linux server, I just use sed to replace the periods in the TV Show name with underscores. I then use grep i to match it with the correct folder containing the TV Show in the Plex Library folder and use the rest of the showepisode number to put the file in the right place. Funny enough, one of the shows Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in fact happens to come with periods in its name.p  pIs there an easy way to match together the file name and the plex folder name without having the underscore problem described abovep  pOr should I simply set an exception for this particular showp

The problem is, codegroupgtmemberscode looks like its supposed to hold all members of that group, however if the group has about 10000 members, this may take up some space, with every member having their unique data like names, ids, about mes and such. And to take it one step further it is unspeakable for a browser to display that many results at once, or even at all. How can pagination be done in this scenario If I pass codegetMemberscode a variable then codegroupgtmemberscode becomes kind of nonsense because it is going to hold a very small portion of the groups members and what good is thatp  pAlso this goes not for just this example, what ever it may be, groups, news, feeds  everything that may return too many rows at once, how is it done in OOPp

Negative 930 pI have a classic ASP application with SQL Server Express that includes a couple of maintenance scripts that take potentially a few minutes to run. On the old Windows Server 2003 and 2008 installations, SQL Server Express would be capped at 50 of CPU during a longrunning script, which was fine.p  pRecently I got a new machine with Windows 2012 Server, and on this one, SQL Server Express is capped at only 10 of CPU in longrunning scripts. As a result, the new machine is marginally slower at running the scripts, despite being much more powerful. Is there a way to control and increase the CPU quota for SQL Server Express in this situation, to perhaps 25p  pI realize that SQL Server Express is limited to using 4 cores, but my new machine is only six cores, and the theoretical limit would seem to be 67 from this factor.p  pWhere would this parameter be managed Would it be a Windows setting, or a SQL Server Express setting, or an IIS setting that governs the CPU quota for a single scriptp  pA couple of possibilities I think I have ruled outp  ul liIIS allows setting a limit on the CPU usage by an application pool, but this is not enabled by default, and was not enabled on my server.li liWindows has a utility called Windows Server Resource Manager but this also is not installed on my server.  In any case, it would only act when total CPU usage was above 70, and I notice the apparent limitation on SQL Server Express even when the CPU is otherwise idle.li ul

Negative 930 pIve read through the doc and spec of JSONLD and JSONLDAPI and might as well have missed something.p  pI found that the local context of an object node may be composed by defining context [.., .., ...] as an array of multiple context definitions some of which may be inlined, others may be external references. I also found that referencing an external context assumes the corresponding IRI reference resolves to a JSONLD document with an expected context definition in its root object node, which is to be used in place of the original reference to the external context.p  pMy question is Is it valid or reasonable, or implied, that the referenced context in the remote JSONLD document may also be composite just like an ordinary local context, or is a referenced external context restricted to being a emdefiniteem context entity i.e. either a local XOR external definition, i.e. NOT an emarrayem of many context definitionsp  pThis question is probably directed towards the authors of the JSONLD standard.p

Negative 930 pI am using pyodbc version 3.0.7 to access an Oracle version 11g database.  We are writing stored procedures to handle the insertions.  The primary keys for inserted objects are assigned with triggers, so we want to get the newlyinserted objects primary key into python after the stored procedure is called by the python script. Due to client requirements, we dont have the flexibility of changing database, libraries, etc.p  pAccording to the pyodbc documentation, return OUT parameters in stored procedures are not supported.  Neither are stored functions.  The documentation suggests to add a SELECT statement to the end of a stored procedure to get results out.  However, we are new to SQL scripting, and Google searching for the last two days has turned up a lot of information for SQLServer and other databases, but next to nothing for Oracle.  Trying the SQLServer examples on the Oracle db has not been tremendously helpful, as the Oracle SQL Developer shows various errors with the syntax DECLARE where one shouldnt be, INTO required for SELECT statements, etc..p  pUltimately, we want the stored procedure to insert a new object, and then we want to somehow get the newlycreated primary key for that object.p  pHere is an example of a stored procedure that correctly inserts an object note that if objid is given as None in python, then the object is assigned a new primary key by a triggerp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE insertanobj anobjid NUMBER AS   newprimarykey NUMBER BEGIN   INSERT INTO OBJS OBJID VALUES anobjid RETURNING OBJID INTO newprimarykey     A SELECT statement should go here in order to get the new value for newprimarykey. END insertanobj codepre  pSupposedly, a SELECT statement at the end of the stored procedure will make it so the next time my script calls codecursor.fetchallcode, the script would get a list of whatever was selected.  However, I have been unable to get this to work.  Some failed SELECT examples one of which might go in the stored procedure above in place of the SELECT comment include the followingp  precode These fail to compile because SQL Developer doesnt like them though various sources online said that they work on SQLServer SELECT  FROM OBJS WHERE OBJIDnewprimarykey SELECT OBJID FROM OBJS WHERE OBJIDnewprimarykey codepre  pLike I said, Im new to SQL, and likely I just need to know the proper syntax to get the SELECT statement working nicely in Oracle.  Any suggestions  Or is there something that Im misunderstanding p

Negative 930 pI am using the Bootstrap carousel on my website, instead of using the usual circle indicators I am using thumbnail images of each picture. I am planning on doing this dynamically later so at the moment have just added sample images. p  pI want my right and left glyphicons to line up next to the first and last thumbnail however I cant see to get it right.

Negative 930 pI have a pretty big index.php fileabout 500kB in which lots of logic and database query are presentand the index.php which goes to the client is about 200kB. brWhat Id like to do is first of all compress the file using gzip, which I do by simply adding codeSendOutputFiltercode in my code.htaccesscode file. Now, since the file is pretty big to process for the server, TTFB can take a while and therefore Id like to send to the user the header of the file before even looking at the query so that the browser will discover images, css and jswhich are also pretty big and will start downloading instead of being idle waiting for the whole index.php being processed on the server Id like something like Google search does. It starts download pngs before the whole page is loadedand the page is compressed.br I made some query and I couldnt find any straightforward solution. All I found is that either I disable gzip and use flush or use gzip but not flush.br But as you can see in my case I need both, and I know this can be done somehow. Possibly with some workarounds.br This is how huge modern websites already do, so Id like to know how.p

The tool is helping us populate a product carousel on the front page of our eCommerce site and we want to determine the revenue generated when the following funnel is completedp  ol liUser clicks an item from the carousel taking them to the product pageli liUser adds that item to their cartli liUser completes a checkout with that item in their cartli ol  pCurrently, we have the products in the carousel tagged with a cmsp Coremetrics Site Promotion tag but that is not sufficient to our needs currently. The Site Promotion captures all revenue for any session that clicks the SP link regardless of whether that item was added to cart.p  pWe do have Shop Action 5 tags on the PDPs Product Display Pages that fire when the product is added to cart and Shop Action 9 tags when the user completes their checkout process. Is there any way we can build a report that will put all of that data together e.g. a report that will capture all Shop Action 5 tags that fired on pages with the cmsp link Is there a cleaner way to capture this datap

Negative 930 pI have an Web application publishing a webservice and deployed on cluster having two instances. LB forwards traffic to each active instance. When I want to deploy new Application into both instances I am following the steps.p  p1 stop instanceA, deploy new applicationp  p2 start instanceA with new loadp  p3 stop instanceB, deploy new applicationp  p4 start instanceB with new loadp  pwith this model there is operation loosing since when I kill the instanceA ,tasks in its queue are not processed.

Negative 930 pWe use the ShuntingYard algorithm to evaluate expressions.  We can validate the expression by simply applying the algorithm.  It fails if there are missing operands, missmatched parenthesis, and other things.  The ShuntingYard algorithm however has a larger supported syntax than just human readable infix.  For example,p  precode1  2  1 2 1 2  codepre  pare all acceptable ways to provide 12 as input to the ShuntingYard algorithm.   1 2 and 1 2  are not valid infix, but the standard ShuntingYard algorithm can handle them.  The algorithm does not really care about the order, it applies operators by order of precedence grabbing the nearest operands.p  pWe would like to restrict our input to valid human readable infix.  I am looking for a way to either modify the ShuntingYard algorithm to fail with nonvalid infix or provide an infix validation prior to using ShuntingYard.p  pIs anyone aware of any published techniques to do this  We must support both basic operator, custom operators, brackets, and functions with multiple arguments.  I havent seen anything that works with more than the basic operators online.p  pThanksp

Negative 930 pIm about to write an application for Android, and it will use Mysql. I know that access to DB is really expensive in terms of time, and would like to know how often do applications like instant messaging, online gaming access to databases For example in a game, we would like to save the positions of a player in the world, when hes moving all the time.p  pIs the database access actually not expensive, and there is a way to be connected to it all the time and just do request that are actually not expensivep  pOr is IT really expensive in anyway, and there are techniques to access to it for example every X interval of time, and saving it locally in the meantimep  pI Know that my question is really general, and it depends always on what we need and want.

Negative 930 pIve got an app successfully using the AWS SDK framework, and now Im trying to import a static library as a homemade framework, sharing code with several of my other projects.p  pThe problem is in order to import my static library, I a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma26154071418688need to adda the codeObjCcode linker flag in order to import the library, but whenever I add that linker flag, AWS emfreaks outem and gives me 40 red compile errors.p  pIm entirely new to linker flags and library importing, so I honestly dont really know where to start.  Ive done some research, but the best lead I can find is the suggestion that I could use codeforceloadcode instead of codeObjCcode, but that seems to require manually adding every .m file in the Build Phases section, and my library includes hundreds of such files.p  pIs there a simpler solution to this problem than adding every one of those files so I can use codeforceloadcode  How can I get the AWK SDK and the needs of importing my library to play nicely togetherp  pstrongEDITstrong From a suggestion in the comments, here is the error Im getting when I add the codeObjCcode linker flag.  Without that flag and without adding the static library, the app compiles successfully with the codeAWSiOSSDKv2code framework.  But adding that linker flag which, as I understand it, is needed for the static library, but even before adding that library immediately results in thisp  pem[code removed to fit within character limit]emp  pstrongEDIT 2strong Based on Yosuke Matsudas answer, I added codelibsqlite3.dylibcode, which I was missing.  Now the previous errors have disappeared, but I have dozens hundreds of duplicate symbol lines, ending in a single red Linker command failed with exit code 1 error.  I would include them all but, hilariously, they put my post at 73,111 characters, well over the 30,000 character limit.  p  pFunny thing is, they seem to be from conflicts caused by requirements of the frameworks themselves for example, codeAWSCorecode in the AWS Framework requires the codeBoltscode framework, but they seem to conflict with a bunch of duplicate symbols.p  pAnd, as before, simply removing codeObjCcode from the Linker Flags allows the app to compile normally and successfully.p  precodeduplicate symbol OBJCMETACLASSPodsDummyPodsReachability in

Negative 930 pI am using AngularJS in a mobile application. Users are able to add products to an order. But I am using different tabs so that the user can switch between categories and for each category the products get shown who belong to that category. These products can be added to hisher order. If a user clicks on the  the product gets added and de  changes into a 1. If the user clicks again the 1 changes in a 2 etc... This works great BUT when the user clicks another tab to view products of another category and after that comes back to the previous tab the amounts of all products are back to  but should be 1 or 2 or 3 or ... if the the user already added this product to his order.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYzGr8.jpg altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhp2G0.jpg altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comm4Dvr.jpg altenter image description herep  pSo after adding some products of category Frappes the user changes to category Ice tea and after returning to Frappes the products that he added before should still be marked but this isnt the case as you can see...p  pstrongAngularJSstrongp  precodeCOMPOSE ORDER ADDREMOVEUPDATE      scope.productRemove  functionevent, pid         scope.productid  pid         ifscope.order.length gt 0                      forvar b  0 bltscope.order.lengthb                ifscope.order[b].prodid  pid                                    ifscope.order[b].aantal gt 1                                           scope.order[b].aantal                       document.getElementByIdaantal.innerHTML  document.getElementByIdaantal.innerHTML  1                                        else                                            scope.order.spliceb,1                        document.getElementByIdaantal.innerHTML                          update quantity in app UI                                                                    scope.productAdd  functionevent,pname, pid, pprice          scope.pzelfdeid  1         scope.pzelfde  1         scope.prodname  pname         scope.prodid  pid         scope.price  pprice         ifscope.order.length  0             scope.order.pushprodid scope.prodid, prodname scope.prodname, aantal 1, price scope.price, size M, extras              event.currentTarget.innerHTML  1                          else ifscope.order.length gt 0             forvar b  0 bltscope.order.lengthb                              ifscope.order[b].prodid  pid                                      scope.pzelfdeid  scope.order[b].prodid                        scope.pzelfde  b                                           ifscope.pzelfde gt 1                              scope.order[scope.pzelfde].aantal                 event.currentTarget.innerHTML  scope.order[scope.pzelfde].aantal                                       else                              scope.order.pushprodid scope.prodid, prodname scope.prodname, aantal 1, price scope.price, size M, extras                  event.currentTarget.innerHTML  1                                            codepre  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precode  ltonstemplate typetextonstemplate idlattes.htmlgt       ltonscarousel swipeable overscrollable autoscroll styleheight 100 width 100gt         ltonscarouselitemgt             ltonslistgt               ltonslistitem ngrepeatproduct in products  filtersearch  orderBy categorygt                 ltulgt                  ltligtlta href idaantal ngclickproductAddevent,product.name, product.id, product.pricegtltagtltligt                  ltligt                     ltonscol width100gt                         ltdiv classnamegt                           product.name                         ltdivgt                     ltdiv classdescgt                         product.description                         ltdivgt                     ltonscolgt                  ltligt                  ltligtlta href idaantal  ngclickproductRemoveevent, product.idgtltagtltligt                                     ltulgt             ltonslistitemgt           ltonslistgt       ltonscarouselitemgt         ltonscarouselgt     ltonstemplategt codepre  pSo any ideas to solve this properlyp

Negative 930 pSay we have a base interface defined in C like sop  precodeinterface IBase      int Prop1  get set      string Prop2  get set   codepre  pThen we have a derived interface as followsp  precodeinterface ISub1 IBase      int Prop3  get set   codepre  pThese interfaces are defined in an API assembly against which custom applications compile and run. The assembly also includes nonexposed classes which implement these interfaces and public factory methods for obtaining instances. All extant code uses codeISub1code, there is no existing code which directly references codeIBasecode. It was done this way in anticipation that we might eventually want to introduce a second derived interface codeISub2code, as a peer of codeISub1code, and that has now come to pass. Unfortunately though we find that codeISub2code should not contain codeProp2code only Prop1 and some additional unique properties, hence we want to demote that property down into codeISub1code, resulting in the following revised interfacesp  precodeinterface IBase      int Prop1  get set    interface ISub1 IBase      string Prop2  get set      int Prop3  get set    interface ISub2 IBase      string Prop4  get set   codepre  pGiven that there are no consumers of codeIBasecode it seems like we should be able to do this with impunity and Im fairly sure we could do that in Java, but when attempting to do so we have run into a binary compatibility problem with code compiled against the old interface definitions. Specificallyp  precodeISub1 s1  ...  get an instance s1.Prop2  help codepre  pThis code, when run against the new interface definition, fails with an exception as followsp  blockquote   pSystem.MissingMethodException  Method not found Void   MyNamespace.IBase.setProp2System.String.p blockquote  pNote the reference to codeIBasecode. I presume this to be because the seeming call to codeISub1.setProp2code has been compiled with a tight binding to where codeProp2code is actually introduced, in codeIBasecode.p  pCan anyone help me with a way out of this conundrum I.e. is there a way to refactor the interfaces so that the definition of ISub2 is clean does not include the extraneous Prop2 Asking all existing applications to recompile is out of the question.p

Negative 930 pI wonder if someone have some experience with searching a lot of documents eg. 5000  20000 with tons of filters lets say about 40 different parameters in modxp  pIve tried AdvSearch, but using TVs as parameters is bad idea  search took too many time.p  pToday i read about SOLR, and i found implementation of this engine to modx with Simple Search addon. So it is good idea to use addons like this, or maybe try to design my own system Main problem with second option is that, i have no experience with searchingfilteringsorting design. Modx API is not a problem, but searching and filtering so much documents is.p

Negative 930 pstrongPlease notestrong I was originally going to title this question emWhen to use registers in Cem, however it seems like someone a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2068721whentouseregistersincalready beat me to the puncha. strongHoweverstrong, the way that question was asked when compared to the title is a bit misleading, and I believe this question is unique and emnotem a dupe of it.p  pWhereas, that question really ought to have been titled emAre coderegistercode variables really fasterem, I actually want to know emwhenem one should be using coderegisterscode. Its obvious to me that they are in fact faster, but obviously your CPU only has so many register on chip, and so you are limited by what you can store on them.p  pSo I ask How do I select which variables should be qualified with coderegistercode Variables that are used with a certain frequency Variables of a particular size or type Variables that are used in computebound problems Something elsep  pI look at it like this to every product owner or stakeholder, emeveryem single bug or feature is top priority and critical. But if you really analyse their needs, you will see that some features are in deed more top priority than others. With code, you want it to run as fast as possible, and so Im sure emeveryem variable is a candidate for optimizationperformance tuning. But I would emimagineem that if you really analyse a program or the C compiler for that matter, lets assume codegcccode, Im sure theres a way to determine which variables are best suited for use with coderegistercode.p

On all other posts its off to the rightabove where it should be. Can anyone explain how to fix this The theme is live a hrefhttpleahsthememaker.tumblr.com relnofollowherea.

Negative 930 pI have some CT images for some rock, and I want to build a 3D image out of these images.

Negative 930 pIm using a base model for all models, where Im using a logical delete function overriding default delete function, and at the same time Im overriding find method also, to only show records that are logically not deleted. Now I have a rule in one of my models, to check if the combination of the two values are already taken or not. It seems this uses also the find method. If there is a combination already, but logically deleted, I wont get the error message that this was already taken in the past. Because if the user would once more create the record with the same values, I would like rather to unlock it or delete the logical deleted state of it. Is there a workaround for this Maybe with scenarios I have no clue how can I customize find method further to search not only for logically not deleted records, only when validating for insert. Otherwise I would have to delete p  precode...findgtwhere[softDeleteTimestamp gt NULL] codepre  pfrom my base model and add it to all search models, what would be not really nice. Thanks.p

Specifically, a 90 degree clockwise turn, and an 180 degree clockwise turn. p  pThe actual problem is much bigger, but I think theres a rule against getting straight up answers to problems, so I cut it down to what I need.p  pThe problem is this    After I run method one, the original array becomes modified, so its corrupted before I run method two.p  pFor instance, Original before method Onep  precode1111 0000 0000 0000 codepre  pOriginal after method Onep  precode0001 0001 0001 0001 codepre  pThese changes happens right after I run transposematrix and reverseRowmatrix. Note that in java debug mode, I can see original being changed when I step over these methods. I DIDNT EVEN MENTION ORIGINAL. I modified a passed of a passed version of Original.p  pSo, 3 questionsp  ol lipI thought that objects passed to methods dont get changed unless you return the changed object and then set the original to the changed in main or the original method Im not talking about transpose, or reverseRow, because those were supposed to change matrix inside method One.pli lipI tested this out with a method using strings. My belief above held true. Are int[][]s differentpli lipHow can I fix it so that original doesnt get changed Or am I missing something really simplepli ol
Negative 930 pI have a program with two processes that communicate with shared memory. On ctrlc I want both processes to exit. Im using a codeatomicboolcode variable called stop to inform the processes to keep looping or exit when set to true. However when the codeatomicboolcode variable stop is set to true the other process does not see the change. Meaning it still prints out 0 instead of 1, but the process that made the change shows 1. So why doesnt the second process see the change from false to truep  pControlc wont work for killing the process so use codekillallcode instead.p  precodeinclude ltstring.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltsignal.hgt include ltstdbool.hgt include ltstdatomic.hgt include ltsysmman.hgt include ltsyswait.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include lterrno.hgt  struct sharedmap       atomicbool stop    struct sharedmap map  int compareandswaploopatomicbool target, int value       Loop until we can succesfully update the the value.      while1               Grab a snapshot of the value that need to be updated.          bool snapshot  atomicloadamptarget          ifatomiccompareexchangeweakamptarget, ampsnapshot, value  true                       We succesfully updated the value lets exit this loop and return.              break                   printfresult dn, atomicloadamptarget      return 0   static void ctrlchandlerint sig      compareandswaploopampmapgtstop, true      return   void setupsignalhandlervoid      void signalSIGINT, ctrlchandler      return   static int createsharedvoid pointer, int size      pointer  mmapNULL, size, PROTREAD  PROTWRITE, MAPANON  MAPSHARED, 1, 0     ifpointer  MAPFAILED              printfmmap sn, strerrorerrno         return 1           return 0   static void loopvoid       Set up signal handler.      setupsignalhandler       Check if we should stop or continue running.      whileatomicloadampmapgtstop  false              sleep2          printfmapgtstop dn, atomicloadampmapgtstop           return   int mainvoid      int rtrn     pidt pid      rtrn  createsharedvoid ampmap, sizeofstruct sharedmap     ifrtrn lt 0              printfCant create shared memoryn         return 1           atomicinitampmapgtstop, false      pid  fork     ifpid  0              loop          exit0          else ifpid gt 0              int status          waitpidpid, ampstatus, 0          return 0          else              printffork sn, strerrorerrno         return 1           return 0  codepre

Negative 930 pIm building a simple site using bootstrap and I was trying to modify the style of a alert box. p  pIn the head Im linking to the Bootstrap CSS, the Bootstrap optional theme, and then my custom style sheet in this order.

However I dont fully understand why. I have been looking at the optional theme CSS which states for this alert boxp  precodealertsuccess    backgroundimage webkitlineargradienttop, dff0d8 0, c8e5bc 100   backgroundimage      olineargradienttop, dff0d8 0, c8e5bc 100   backgroundimage webkitgradientlinear, left top, left bottom, fromdff0d8, toc8e5bc   backgroundimage         lineargradientto bottom, dff0d8 0, c8e5bc 100   filter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradientstartColorstrffdff0d8, endColorstrffc8e5bc, GradientType0   backgroundrepeat repeatx   bordercolor b2dba1  codepre  pI see that the color that insists on not changing to black the green dff0d8 is mentioned several times here. I think that the reason that I cant change the background color of the alertsuccess box when using the optional CSS theme is because when using this theme the background is no longer a solid color as in backgroundcolor black but becomes a webkit gradient whatever that is. Am I understanding this correctly Is there an easy way to override this or turn of this gradient for this particular alert box in my custom CSS sheet.p  pIm new to this and I dont yet fully understand the webkit rules in CSS sheets. Thanks in advance.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThanks to the help of everyone below I was able to understand the problem and correct it. Here it isp  pThe optional bootstrap theme that Im using creates the background through backgroundimage and not backgroundcolor like I was trying to do. So even though I am correctly changing the backgroundcolor, a backgroundimage is being created on top of it. There are to ways to do what I want here   Adding backgroundimage none in the custom CSS   Changing backgroundcolor black to background black in the custom CSS rulep  pThanks everyone.p

Negative 930 pIve been working with the RequireJS optimizer to create multiple optimized JS files for my project and have come across a problem that Ive found mentioned in other posts but have not found a solution for.p  pWhen using r.js to optimized a single file, it pulls all the JS dependency into  single file and drops it into the file specified by the out property in the build file.  However, when trying to create two optimized files i.e. multipage project using the modules property, r.js creates two nicely optimized files but then drops ALL folders and files from the appDir into the output directory.   That is, it pulls together and minifies all JS dependencies but then copies the individual files into the output directory.p  pI realize that r.js is not intended to be a deployment tool so is this by design or is there a way to tell r.js to not copy dependent files and directories into the output directory.p

Negative 930 pLets say I have the following code in javap  precodebyte t  byte 0b10001000 byte z  0b00000000 z  byte tz codepre  pYoud think the output would be 10001000, however it ends up being 1111000 in String representation, the  sign being the first 1 of course, making it 11111000. If I do the same code but with the last bit in z as a 1, e.g. 00000001, and I perform the same operation, I get 1110111, or 11110111. I figure this is due to some conversion issue with the negatively signed byte t. Is there any way to avoid this Is there any way to have 10000000 work the same in an OR operation as 01000000p

Negative 930 pI am working on an application where I send a post request to my rails server with parameters stored in JSON format. Lets say my application routes the request to the create function on my catscontroller. The cat model has three fields name, hunger, mood. Now each cat hasmany kittens. My Kitten model has two fields catid referring to which cat owns it, because my kitten belongsto a cat and cute. Now every time i create a cat on my application I want to do it with a single call, so I call cats.json from my app with a POST request. The parameters are stored in JSON format and they include the following fields name,hunger, mood,cute. Now the controller takes these params creates a new cat, and then creates a new kitten assigned to this cat using cat.kittens.build. The kitten then just needs to use the last parameter I sent mood to get created properly. p  pNow the question is this, when I print the params variable from this controller I get the following hash name, hunger, mood, cute, catname, hunger, mood.

get the behavior I want with angular model bindingp
Negative 930 pI have a CSS animation which goes from Visible to hidden and solid to transparent at the same time. My problem is, this is an animation which I need to display when a button is clicked. How do I trigger the event on click, when the actual hiding and fading is performed by CSS and not jQuery For example, when Div One is clicked, I want the overlay to play once. Same when the other divs are clicked. I cant seem to work it out, and help would be greatp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecode.btn.clickfunction                var el      .overlay,        newone  el.clonetrue              el.beforenewone           .  el.attrclass  last.remove  codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode.overlay      position fixed     top 0     left 0     height 100     width 100      display table     backgroundcolorrgb39, 174, 96     zindex 10  h1.thankyoumessage  fontsize12.0remdisplay tablecell colorfff textalign center     verticalalign middlewebkitperspective 1000webkitfontsmoothing antialiased  .animatedthankyou       webkitanimationduration 1s      animationduration 1s      webkitanimationfillmode both      animationfillmode both      webkitanimationtimingfunction easeout      animationtimingfunction easeout     webkitkeyframes fadeOutScale       0 visibilityvisible opacity 1transform scale1  CSS3   moztransform    scale1  Firefox   webkittransform scale1  Webkit   otransform      scale1  Opera   mstransform     scale1  IE 9       40 opacity 1transform transform         scale0.75  CSS3   moztransform    scale0.75  Firefox   webkittransform scale0.75  Webkit   otransform      scale0.75  Opera   mstransform     scale0.75  IE 9       60 opacity 1transform transform         scale0.75  CSS3   moztransform    scale0.75  Firefox   webkittransform scale0.75  Webkit   otransform      scale0.75  Opera   mstransform     scale0.75  IE 9       100 visibilityhidden opacity 0  transform  moztransform    scale0.5  Firefox   webkittransform scale0.5  Webkit   otransform      scale0.5  Opera   mstransform     scale0.5  IE 9     keyframes fadeOutScale       0 visibilityvisible opacity 1 transform scale1      40 opacity 1transform scale0.75      60 opacity 1transform scale0.75      100 visibilityhiddenopacity 0 transform scale0.5    .fadeOutScale       webkitanimationname fadeOutScale      animationname fadeOutScale    .animatedfadeout       webkitanimationduration 1s      animationduration 1s      webkitanimationfillmode both      animationfillmode both      webkitanimationtimingfunction easeout      animationtimingfunction easeout     webkitkeyframes fadeOut       0 visibilityvisible opacity 1      40 opacity 1      60 opacity 1      100 visibilityhiddenopacity 0    keyframes fadeOut       0 visibilityvisible opacity 1      40 opacity 1      60 opacity 1      100 visibilityhiddenopacity 0    .fadeOut       webkitanimationname fadeOut      animationname fadeOut  codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classoverlay animatedfadeout fadeOutgtlth1 classthankyoumessage animatedthankyou fadeOutScalegtThank Youlth1gtltdivgt   ltdiv classbtn styleheight20pxgtONEltdivgt ltdiv classbtn styleheight20pxgttwoltdivgt ltdiv classbtn styleheight20pxgtthreeltdivgtcodepre div div p
