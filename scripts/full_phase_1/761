For example, you would emnotem require that general computer users learn python in order to write an email filter.   Similarly, rule emlanguagesem, such as a hrefhttpherzberg.ca.sandia.govJESSa, are only a partial solution, since some simpler user interface needs to be built ontop of the rule language so nonprogrammers can make use of it.  This interface invariably involves removing some features, or making those features more difficult to use, and that a hrefhttpherzberg.ca.sandia.govprocessa poses the same problems described above.p  pemEditem To clarify, the question is about emdesigningem a rule engine, Im not looking for a prebuilt rule engine.

Negative 761 pIt seems like something like this emshouldem exist, but I have never heard of it and would find such a utility to be incredibly useful. Many times, I develop applications that have a database backed  SQL Server or Oracle. During development, end users of the app are encouraged to test the site  I can verify this by looking for entries in the database...if there are entries, they have been testing...if not, they havent.p  pWhat I would like is a toolutility that would do this checking for me. I would specify the Database and connection parameters and the tool would pool the database periodically based on values that I specify and alert me if there was any new activity in the database perhaps it would pop up a notification in the system tray. I could also specify multiple database scenarios to monitor in the tool. If such an app existed, I wouldnt have to manually run queries against databases for new activity. Im aware of SQL Profiler, but when I reviewed it, it seemed like overkill for what I wanted to do and it also wouldnt do the Oracle DB monitoring. Also, to use SQL Profiler, you have to be an admin of the database. I would need to monitor databases where I only have a readonly account.p  pDoes someone know if such a tool existsp

Each row has the background colour set based on that priority, so for example the highest priority has a light red background.p  pThe row selection color is not so easy to change. I can set it using codetreeview.modifybasegtk.STATESELECTED, C4C4C4code, but no colours work well with the colours used to enhance the concept of priority.p  pI had the idea to change the selection colour to be a slightly darker version of the colour used as the normal row background, so in the example above, that would be a darker red. I tried calling the function above in response to the treeselections codechangedcode signal, and it works, but with heavy flickering.p  pAnother idea was to change the selection to transparent and put a border around it instead, but as far as I can tell, this isnt possible.p  ol liHow can I change the selection colour in the way described above without the flickeringli liCan I change show the selection by having only a border around the rowli ol  pstrongNote Im aware that this violates the theme selected by the user. I feel I have a good reason for it. Having the priority indicated by colour makes it instantly recognisable. The selection colour hides this. If you have alternative suggestions, I am open to them, but it needs to retain the ease at which a user can identify the priority.strongp

Negative 761 pWell I was developing an application usin Symfony 1.4 and Doctrine when I realized a major drawback on my Zend Lucene implementation.p  pI have a model called Publication that is related via foreign key relations with a few other models subjects, genres, languages, authors, etc. and Im getting theyre names when adding a new document to the index using the Jobeet tutorial way so that I can search for publications with a given subject, genre, language, author, etc... The problem is if for some reason I decide to alter the name of one of those related models the Zend Lucene index will not get updated.p  pThe only two solutions I could come up with werep  ol lipReindex all the publications regularly to guarantee that any changes made to the related models gets updated on the index however this solution doesnt allow the index to be updated in real timepli lipGet all the publications that are related with a given model and reindex them after it gets updated using the save, postSave, postUpdate or whatever you can come up with on Doctrine.   This solution seemed great... It will only rebuild the index for the publications that are linked to the updated model right Well, if you have something like a thousand 1000 publications linked to it will take a few minutes to update yeah I tested it and on a user form it will timeout because it takes over 30 seconds and even if it dont it would be bad to have a user looking at the screen for a few minutes awaiting for the page to finish to load.pli ol  pSo what I want to know is if theres another solution Is there a way to update an index on the fly based on a change on a related model without hanging the whole pahe Maybe putting the task to run on the background or something Is there such a wayp  pIf theres no way to do this with Lucene is there any way to use FullText Search with MySQL with InnoDB tables without using Zend Lucene that doesnt have such a drawback If theres such a tool Id glady refactor my code to accommodate a different library.p  pCould you please help me with this Thanks in advancep

Negative 761 pZend Framework has a great component called ZendLocale.

Also there are languages   and regions which are not only   abbreviated with 2 characters.   Therefor you should NOT strip the   region and language yourself, but use   ZendLocale when you want to strip   language or region from a locale   string. Otherwise you could have   unexpected behaviour within your code   when you do this yourself.p blockquote  pPerfect. Except Ive been testing out various language translations. Assuming you browse with Firefox, change your settings and add some languageregion profiles...change the default order. Youll see that Zend only pulls the default. The docs even say sop  blockquote   pIf a user provides more than one   locale within his browser, ZendLocale   will use the first found locale. If   the user does not provide a locale or   the script is being called from the   command line the automatic locale   environment will automatically be   used and returned.p blockquote  pThis is unfortunate. If you have 5 languages defined, you want to go through all the locales the user defined in the browser and use a language that matches...p  pSo my question is, what approach would you take to parse the full list and pull out any matchesp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Theres a ZendLocalegetBrowser method which returns the full list. Great Not sure why ZendTranslate only seems to pull the first one then. Ill come back after checking how that works... will probably need to build the array of langs you have translations for and compare it to the results of getBrowser and pull the first match.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I did implement a solution, but its still kind of hacky, because ZendTranslate and ZendLocale are not small little classes. Internationalization is a large topic, obviously. Theres a fair bit to research.p  pBut in essence it boils down to checking each language for matches against the browser preference list.p
Negative 761 pHow do codeServicescode and codeRepositoriescode relate to each other in DDD I mean, Ive been reading up on DDD for the past 2 days and everywhere I go, theres always a codeServicecode layer and theres always a codeRepositorycode layer.

Negative 761 pHeres a scenariop  pI have an autocomplete plugin custom that keeps a hidden field of JSON objects using a specific struct.p  pIve created an Html helper that helps me easily bind to a specific custom model basically, it has a JSON property that is for twoway binding and a property that lets me deserialize the JSON into the appropriate structp  precodepublic class AutoCompleteModel      public string JSON  get set      public IEnumerableltPersongt People          get              return new JavaScriptSerializer.DeserializeltPersongtthis.JSON                  set              this.JSON  new JavaScriptSerializer.Serializevalue                  codepre  pThis works great and I can model bind using the default binder codeHtml.AutocompleteviewModel gt viewModel.AutoCompleteModelTestcode. The HTML helper generates HTML likep  precodeltinput typetext idAutoCompleteModelTestac nameAutoCompleteModelTestac value gt ltinput typehidden idAutoCompleteModelTestJSON nameAutoCompleteModelTest.JSON valueJSON gt codepre  pThe problem is this is not the best way for consumers. They have to manually set the People property to an array of Person structs. In my data layer, my domain objects probably will not be storing the full struct, only the persons ID a corporate ID. The autocomplete will take care of looking up the person itself if only given an ID.p  pThe best scenario will be to call it like thisp  pcodeHtml.AutocompletedomainObject gt domainObject.PersonIDcode or codeHtml.AutocompletedomainObject gt domainObject.ListOfPersonIDscodep  pI would like it to work against the string property AND against the custom AutoCompleteModel. The autocompleter only updates a single hidden field, and that field name is passed back on postback the value looks like code[ Id12345, FullNameA Name, Id12347, FullNameAnother Name ]code.p  pThe problem is, of course, that those domain object properties only have an ID or array of IDs, not a full Person struct so cannot be directly serialized into JSON. In the HTML helper, I can transform those property values into a struct, but I dont know how to transform it back into a simple type on POST. The solution I need would transform an ID into a new Person struct on page load, serializing it into the hidden field. On POST, it would deserialize the generated JSON back into a simple array of IDs.p  pIs a custom model binder the solution I need How can I tell it to work both with a custom model AND simple types because I dont want it applied to EVERY string property, just need it to deal with the values given by the HTML helper.p

Finally, updates are sent to all connected users of the website via a websocket.p  pNow, Im trying to have this scalable to handle over 10,000 connected users at once, all connected via websocket and sent updates approximately once every 3 seconds. Given that each user can then interact with the web app during this, its to result in many requests back and forth.p  pNow, apart from the high level basic idea I have, with the decision to have Ruby on Rails as the website framework and node js to handle the liveness of it all  Im a little stuck. I dont know what kind of database to use I imagine itll be a non relational database for quick storage and I dont know the specifics of how to architect such a set up, along with how to implement the logic.p  pSo my question is strongGiven my goal, how do I go about structuring such an application and what do I need to know in order to have it scalable and realtime to the level I desirestrongp  pThanks greatly for any help.p

Negative 761 pDoes the standard define precisely what I can do with an object once it has been moved from I used to think that all you can do with a movedfrom object is do destruct it, but that would not be sufficient.p  pFor example, take the function template codeswapcode as defined in the standard libraryp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void swapTamp a, Tamp b      T c  stdmovea  line 1     a  stdmoveb    line 2 assignment to movedfrom object     b  stdmovec    line 3 assignment to movedfrom object  codepre  pObviously, it must be possible to assign to movedfrom objects, otherwise lines 2 and 3 would fail.

Negative 761 pI have a multitenant MySQL database.  For most things I use a tenantid column in tables to discriminate but for a few purposes, it is much better to have a view that is already filtered by tenant id.  So for example, I might have a view called quarterlysalesview but for tenant 30 I would have quarterlysalesview30 and for tenant 51 I would have quarterlysalesview51.  I create these views dynamically and everything is working great but we have just a few tenants right now and I realize this would never work for millions of tenants.p  pMy question is, am I going to run into either performance problems or just hard limits with a few thousand, few hundred, or few dozen custom viewsp  pstrongADDITIONAL INFOstrong p  pI am using a 3rd party tool immature that requires a table name or view name, since its readonly and operates on that. In the context its working, I cant let it have access to the entire view, so I create another view that is simply defined as SELECT  FROM MasterView WHERE TenantId  30. I recognize this as a workaround for a poor limitation of having to have the tool work on the table directly. Luckily this tool is open source, so I can tweak it to use a different approach. I just wanted to have an idea of how long I had before the current approach blew up.p

Negative 761 pI am trying to create a custom control that has the following features p1. A horizontal listbox backed by a listcollectionview and ultimately an ObservableCollection. P2. Each of the listbox items has several properties usable for filtering and sorting e.g. name, datetime, etc. P3. A filter or sort rule could be applied either instantaneously or continuously. pa. Continuously the rule is enforced as items are edited, added or removed. pb. Instantaneously the rule is enforced once but that ordering is preserved as items or edited. This means items that are added could be at an index of the users choosing. In the continuous case they would obviously have the index determined by the sortfilter rules. P4. When a continuous filter is not applied the items should be reorderable using drag and drop.p  pThis initially seemed like a job for the collectionview as it allows the filtering parts to be done easily for the continuous case using IEditableObject.p  pI have a behaviour for drag and drop reordering which works fine when I edit the underlying collection at drop. I cant edit the collectionview by placing an element at index so its not quite the behavior I need. Also I dont really want to edit the underlying collection as the ordering is purely UI and the underlying collection could be used in multiple collectionviews.p  pSo its point 4 Im really stuck on. I have enough questions, posts and blogs about this to make my head spin and I am sure that I am either missing something obvious or its just not possible without inheriting from collectionview or similar.p  pAny kick in the right direction appreciated. p  pThanksp

Negative 761 pFor years Ive been following a great pattern called TargetAction which goes like thisp  pAn object calls a specified selector on a specified target object when the time comes to call. This is very useful in lots of different cases where you need a simple callback to an arbitrary method.p  pHeres an examplep  precode voiditemLoaded      [specifiedReceiver performSelectorspecifiedSelector]  codepre  pUnder ARC it now turns out that doing something like this all of a sudden became dangerous.p  pXcode throws a warning that goes like thisp  blockquote   pPerformSelector may cause a leak because its selector is unknownp blockquote  pOf course the selector is unknown since as part of the TargetAction design pattern you can specify whatever selector you want in order to get a call when something interesting happens.p  pWhat bugs me most about this warning is that it says there can be a potential memory leak. From my understanding ARC doesnt bend the memory management rules but instead simply automates the insertion of retainreleaseautorelease messages at the right locations.p  pAnother thing to note here performSelector does have an codeidcode return value. ARC analyzes method signatures to figure out through application of naming conventions if the method returns a 1 retain count object or not. In this case ARC doesnt know if the selector is a codenewFooBarcode factory or simply calling an unsuspicious worker method which is almost always the case with TargetAction anyways. Actually ARC should have recognized that I dont expect a return value, and therefore forget about any potential 1 retain counted return value. Looking at it from that point of view I can see where ARC is coming from, but still there is too much uncertainty about what this really means in practice. p  pDoes that now mean under ARC something can go wrong which would never happen without ARC I dont see how this could produce a memory leak. Can someone give examples of situations in which this is dangerous to do, and how exactly a leak is created in that casep  pI really googled the hell out of the internet but didnt find any site explaining emwhyem.p

Negative 761 pI came across this question from interviewstreet.comp  blockquote   pMachines have once again attacked the kingdom of Xions.  The kingdom   of Xions has N cities and N1 bidirectional roads. The road network is   such that there is a unique path between any pair of cities.p      pMorpheus has the news that K Machines are planning to destroy the   whole kingdom. These Machines are initially living in K different   cities of the kingdom and anytime from now they can plan and launch an   attack. So he has asked Neo to destroy some of the roads to disrupt   the connection among Machines i.e after destroying those roads there   should not be any path between any two Machines.p      pSince the attack can be at any time from now, Neo has to do this task   as fast as possible. Each road in the kingdom takes certain time to   get destroyed and they can be destroyed only one at a time. p      pYou need to write a program that tells Neo the minimum amount of time   he will require to disrupt the connection among machines.p      pSample Input First line of the input contains two, spaceseparated   integers, N and K. Cities are numbered 0 to N1. Then follow N1   lines, each containing three, spaceseparated integers, x y z, which   means there is a bidirectional road connecting city x and city y, and   to destroy this road it takes z units of time. Then follow K lines   each containing an integer. Ith integer is the id of city in which ith   Machine is currently located.p      pOutput Format Print in a single line the minimum time required to   disrupt the connection among Machines.p      pstrongSample Inputstrong p  precode5 3 2 1 8 1 0 5 2 4 5 1 3 4 2 4 0 codepre      pstrongSample Outputstrong p  precode10 codepre      pExplanation Neo can destroy the road connecting city 2 and city 4 of   weight 5 , and the road connecting city 0 and city 1 of weight 5.

Negative 761 pI created a Python commandline application. One of the features is that it prints a list of items taken from database when you call it with emlem switch.

I cant use mouse position which would be more comfortable because its commandline application. Another thing is, where is the most suitable place to print a description, to be able to repeatedly remove it and print description for another item, so the screen is not cluttered with uninteresting information The user should display only the information that interests him in a particular moment.p  pThe length of the list is unlimited.

Negative 761 pI was debugging some C code in GDB and I found out that some calls were making use of a socalled synthetic pointer. Googling around did not produce any meaningful result. Searching here on SO, most questions with synthetic in their title refer to some Java feature even if they suggest me that synthetic, in this context, could mean something generated artificially by the compiler.p  pE.g., look at this backtrace, took from one operation, performed in the constructor of codeMyClasscode, over one class member called codemcode this code has been compiled with codeO2codep  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode0  MyClass arg..., thisltsynthetic pointergt at somefile.h144 144     mgtlock gdb print this 1  MyClass  const ltsynthetic pointergt gdb print this 2  ltoptimized outgt codepre  pThe stack trace above clearly states that codethiscode is a pointer to an object that has been optimized out, but how is it possible that a method i.e., its constructor has been called on it My wild guess is that, even if the enclosed object codemcode is actively used in the code, some optimizations let the compiler decide that the enclosing object codethiscode is not really necessary. Since the method call codemgtlockcode, that cannot be optimized out, must be emitted somewhere, the compiler creates a fake synthetic object, located nowhere in memory, just to wrap codemcode.p  pI do not have a strong compiler experience, so I do not know if this conclusion really makes sense. Could someone please shed some light on thisp  pThank you.p

But it seems things stop there.p  pBut if the base class virtual function is pure, that forces the derived classes to implement the function. Hence, a pure public virtual function is merely an interface. I can see a benefit here.p  pOn the other hand, by making a base class virtual function private, only gives the derived class the ability to override the function, but I see no benefit of this. Its as if that private virtual function is not even there. The derived class obviously does not know about the existence of that virtual function in base class because its private, so is there any benefit of declaring a base class private function virtual, in term of inheritance or polymorphismp  pAlso, is there any situation where a base class would declare a function pure virtual and privatep  pThank you.p

reset codepre  pbr If you observe the logcat, first it iterates through 49 values of acceleration and their respective time stamps in milliseconds. Then there is a avg, sum, max, min etc. bR Then if you see there is a codestartpos3code and codeendpos8code. This is the iteration number range, I am using to calculate the distance .i.e I am using the values of acceleration and timestamp only from iteration 3 to 8. brThis is because, I detect the start of distance calculation from a strongrise in accelerationstrong to a strongsudden changestrong in the opposite direction. You can see that the values from 38 fit into the logic. From 3 there is a considerable rise in acceleration and after 8 there is a sudden decrease.p

However, that seems overly verbose, as I would think it could go without saying. Also, it doesnt seem to me like codeToNumbercode can even throw an error. Could someone confirm or help me to understand the real meaningp

Negative 761 pSo Ive been looking around for a good answer to this question, but havent really found anything useful. Hopefully someone can shed some light on this for me.p  pBasically, I have a repeater that is backed by a database table. Inside the ItemTemplate for this repeater, I have some HTML elements that are populated with properties from each item in the list. Pretty standard stuff. However, there is a possibility that one of the items could be null. In that case, it would make sense for me to put some sort of codeif blah  nullcode logic around the offending code. The only problem is, when Ive tried to do so, ASP throws up on me, telling me that I cant use an if statement inside of codelt gtcode. p  pMy question to the masses is this if you cant use an if statement inside of codelt gtcode, then how are you supposed to do conditional logic based on the values of each itemp  pI know that you can call your own methods inside the repeater, but that wont work for what Im trying to do. p  pBelow is what Im trying to accomplish, to better illustrate my point.p  precodeltaspRepeater runatserver IDrepeatergt     ltItemTemplategt         ltdiv classitemwrapgt             lt ifEvalimageUrl  null  gt             ltdiv classplanimggt                 ltaspImage runatserver ImageUrllt EvalimageUrl gtgt             ltdivgt             lt  gt         ltdivgt     ltItemTemplategt ltaspRepeatergt codepre

We have agreed to issue SAML2 tokens for our users, with a set of claims used by the 3rdparty site to query an present a personalized view to our usersp  pSomething important in our scenario is that users are already authenticated in our web site when they decide to access the 3rdpart web site.p  pWhat is the best way to implement all this I am thinking on implementing a customSTS using the WIF SDK to generated those SAML2 tokens and pass then using HTTP POST cookie to the 3rd party site. If this is the right approach, then any pointers, tips Will ADFS make any differencep  pThanks for any helpp
Negative 761 pI am trying to partition my application into modules by features packaged into separate jars such as featurea.jar, featureb.jar, ... etc. p  pIndividual feature jars such as featurea.jar should contain all the code for a feature a including jpa entities, business logic, rest apis, unit tests, integration test ... etc. p  pThe problem I am running into is that bidirectional relationships between JPA entities cause circular references between the jar files. For example Customer entity should be in customer.jar and the Order should be in order.jar but Customer references order and order references customer making it hard to split them into separate jars  eclipse projects.p  pstrongOptions I see for dealing with the circular dependencies in JPA entitiesstrong p  ul liOption 1 Put all the entities into one jar  one project li liOption 2 Dont map certain bidirectianl relationships to avoid circular dependencies across projects. li ul  pstrongQuestionsstrong p  ul liWhat rules  principles have you used to decide when to do bidirectional mapping vs. not li liHave you been able to break jpa entities into their own projects  jar by features if so how did you avoid the circular dependencies issues li ul
Negative 761 pI have been messing around with using smart pointers in my latest C endeavor for memory management. Part of this is that I am using a series of maps to tie a string to a class called an IBlockInput and the class to its current value inside a context. I see two options, but both have the same problemp  pstrongOption 1strong The classs current value is stored inside the class, sorted by contextp  pstrongOption 2strong The classs current value is stored inside the context, sorted by classp  pThe problem here is that either object may die before the other. A Context may be destroyed while all the inputs remain or an input may be destroyed while the context remains. When one dies, the resources need to be released for it. What I have so far is using option 2p  precodestdmapltstdstring, boostweakptrltIBlockInputgt gt inputs stdmapltboostweakptrltIBlockInputgt, boostsharedptrltstdvectorltdoublegt gt gt inputValues codepre  pThe reason they need to be separate like this is that other classes IOutputBlocks need to access and set the values for the IInputBlocks based on their pointer.p  pThere are a few questions I have about thisp  pstrongQuestion 1strong Can I access the inputValues map like a normal map and just pass in the pointer not the boostsharedptrboostweakptr...the T to access it I can use weakptrs or sharedptrs as well if that is the actual way to do itp  pstrongQuestion 2strong I am using weak pointers to let the objects die if needed If I was doing option 1 above, I would have to weak pointers pointing to the context. What happens if the weak pointer expires and I try to access it in the map Is the data it points to lost to the ages or does it still work with the raw pointerp  pstrongQuestion 3strong Perhaps a better way to do this is to use the raw pointers as the keysvalues and then have a supplementary map with the weak pointers for a live check of sorts like sop  precodestdmapltstdstring, IBlockInputgt inputs stdmapltIBlockInput, boostsharedptrltstdvectorltdoublegt gt inputValues stdmapltIBlockInput, boostweakptrltIBlockInputgt gt pointerCache codepre  pThen I could do a live check using the codepointerCachecode to see if I should keep the vector of doubles alive and manage the memory that way. emNOTEem The inputs vector is refreshed relatively often.p  pstrongWhat is the recommended practice for thisstrong I am very new to boost and using smart pointers in general Ive been pampered by C at work for the past several months and not had to worry about this kind of thing.p

Negative 761 pI have two color values in HSI Hue Saturation and Intensity and I want a number which represents the visual difference between the two colors. Hue is a number between 0 and 360 inclusive. Saturation is 0 to 1 and Intensity is 0 to 1.p  pLets consider for example Red and Blue at Saturation of 100 and Intensity of 100. a hrefhttpbgrins.github.comTinyColorAt this website is a way to display the color by entering in the following text.ap  pred is hsv 0, 100, 100p  pblue is hsv 240, 100, 100p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMPrES.png altenter image description herep  pClearly these are two very different colors, and so a simple way I could try to calculate the difference between colors is to use the Hue component and calculate the absolute difference in hue which would be 120 360240 since 360 is also equal to 0 in hue.p  pThe problem arises where the Saturation or Intensity is very dark or light, consider a very dark red and blue.p  pdark red is hsv 0, 100, 20p  pdark blue is hsv 240, 100 20p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWCZ3s.png altenter image description herep  pObviously the visual difference between these two colors is less than the bright red and blue colors, as a human would state if asked to compare the differences. What I mean here is, ask a friend Which pair of colors is most different they will likely say the top bright red blue.p  pI am trying to calculate the difference between two colors as a human would notice. If a human being looked at two colors a and b, then two colors c and d, he could notice which ones are the most different. Firstly if the colors are bright but not too bright then the difference is hue based. If the colors are too bright such as white or too dark such as black or too grey then the differences are smaller.p  pIt should be possible to have a function diff where xdiffa,b and ydiffc,d yields x and y, and I can use x and y to compare the differences to find the most different color or least different color.p

Negative 761 h2Contexth2  pIn an interactive prototyping development on the notebook connected to a cluster, I would like to define a class that is both available in the client codemaincode session and interactively update on the cluster engine nodes to be able to move instances of that class around by passing such instances a argument to a LoadBalanced view. The following demonstrates the typical user sessionp  pFirst setup the parallel clustering environmentp  precodegtgtgt from IPython.parallel import Client gtgtgt rc  Client gtgtgt lview  rc.loadbalancedview gtgtgt rc[] ltDirectView [0, 1, 2]gt codepre  pIn a notebook cell lets define the code snippet of the component we are interactively editing p  precodegtgtgt class MyClassobject ...     def initself, parameter ...         self.parameter  parameter ... ...     def updatesomethingself, somedata ...          do something smart here with somedata amp internal state ... ...     def computesomethingself, otherdata ...          do something smart here with other data amp internal state ...         return something ... codepre  pIn the next cell, lets create a script that builds instances of this class and then use the load balanced view of the cluster environment to evaluate our component on a wide range of input parametersp  precodegtgtgt def processobj, somedata, otherdata ...     obj.updatesomethingsomedata ...     return obj.computesomethingotherdata ... gtgtgt tasks  [] gtgtgt someinstances  [MyClassi for i in range10] gtgtgt for obj in someinstances ...    for somedata in datasource1 ...         for otherdata in datasource2 ...             ar  lview.applyasyncprocess, obj, somedata, otherdata ...             tasks.appendar ... gtgtgt  wait for computation to end gtgtgt results  [ar.get for ar in tasks]  codepre  h2Problemh2  pThat will obviously not work as the engines of the load balanced view will be unable to unpickle the instances passed as first argument to the codeprocesscode function. The process function definition itself is passed successfully as I assume that codeapplyasynccode does bytecode instrospection to pickle it by accessing the code.codecode attribute of the function and then just does a simple pickle for the remaining arguments.p  h2Possible solutions that dont work for meh2  ul lipOne alternative solution would be to use the codepxcode cell magic on the cell holding the definition of the class codeMyClasscode. However that would prevent me to build the class instances in the client script that also do the scheduling. I would need to copy and paste the cell content in an other cell without the codepxcode magic or execute the cell twice once with magic and another time without the magic but this is tedious when I am still editing the methods of the class in an iterative development amp evaluation setting.pli lipAn alternative solution would be to embed the class definition inside the codeprocesscode function but I find this not practical as I would like to reuse that class definition in other functions later in my notebook.pli lipAlternatively I could just stop using a class and only work with functions that can be shipped over to the engines by passing then as first argument to the codeapplyasynccode. However I dont like that either as I would like to prototype my code in an object oriented way for later extraction from the notebook and including the resulting class in an object oriented library. The notebook session serving as a collaborative prototyping tool using for exchanging ideas between developers using the a hrefhttpnbviewer.ipython.orghttpnbviewer.ipython.orga publisher.pli lipThe final alternative would be to write my class in a python module on a file on the filesystem and ship that file to the engines PYTHONPATH using NFS for instance. That works but prevent me to work only in the notebook environment which defeats the whole purpose of interactive prototyping in the notebook.pli ul  pSo basically, is there a way to define a class interactively and then ship its definition around to the enginesp  pIt should be possible to pickle a class definition using the codeinspect.getsourcecode in the client then send the source to the engines and use the codeevalcode builtin but unfortunately source inspection does not work for classes defined inside the codeDummyModcode builtin modulep  pcode TypeError ltIPython.core.interactiveshell.DummyMod object at 0x10c2c4e50gt is a builtin class codep  pIs there a way to inspect the bytecode of a class definition insteadp  pOr is it possible to use the codepxcode magic so as to both execute the content of the cell locally on the client and on each enginep

Negative 761 pI have a Rails application, and Im using Ember on the frontend.

However, I would like to move the emberapp file and all ember javascript code down one level, and when I do so, the templates do not render.

The documentation mentions adding a templatesroot option to the application configuration block, and Im wondering if this is the key. Ive played around a bit, no luck yet.p  pAny ideasp  hr  pUPDATEp  pAfraid Im not having any luck with the templatesroot option.

Negative 761 pI am wondering if there might be a good way to determine if a mobile device is powered on and located on a flying airplane.  Could a solution be generalized for both iOS and Android platforms  Could position, altitude, and speed be determined at a minimum altitude  Would gps be required  Would localization via cel tower info be adequatep  pSomething likep  precodeif altitude gt 100ft off ground ampamp speed gt 200 mph then flying  true codepre  pWould not be perfect, but might be acceptably accurate.p  pWhy  I wonder if aggregate data representing whether a mobile device was powered on during takeoff or landing an airplane could be gathered.  p  pRequirement If a solution provided data for even a small percentage of mobile devices, the aggregate information might be considered significant in terms of determining if having such devices powered on during flight poses an aviation risk.  This would remove hearsay and anecdotal experience from the discussion.  Might help to make an argument that changes policy.p  pPlease try to focus your response towards the technical considerations that would be in play here.  Would device owners have to necessarily download an app and opt in for this information to be known  Would cel tower data somehow be enough  Might more than one approach work p

Negative 761 pWhats the conventional way to update a UI from within a threadp  pFor example I have a method within a class that handles a users login.

Update label on UI  codepre  pI dont want to include the code to update the UI within the method because the class itself is used in other projects, and by other team members on different projects.

Negative 761 pI have an HTML5 canvas that allows user to draw various shapes and a brush feature allowing the user to freehand. I am using the command pattern for these implementations. The problem I am facing is the undo functionality. It works perfectly fine for all the other commands however when it comes to the brush there seems to be an issue with it. p  pThe way the brush works is it stores points with each drag of the mouse, once a new point is added the entire array of points are redrawn on the screen. Only when the user releases the mouse does the drawing stop. You can probably see the problem immediately, the older the points the more they get redrawn on the screen. This causes the line to look much darker in color than it actually is. p  pMy solution is to only connect the last point n1 with point n2 however that literally only redraws the last 2 points. I do not understand fully how the canvas is working and why this method does not work YET redrawing overtop points seems to work...p  pHere is some code outlining the key parts. p  precodeBrushStrat.prototype.mousemovefunctionevent     ifthis.commandnull             add this point to the list         this.command.addPointxevent.canvasX, yevent.canvasY             redraw all points         this.command.drawthis.paint.context        BrushCommand.prototype.drawfunctioncontext     ifthis.points.length0         return           context.beginPath      context.strokeStyle  this.strokeStyle     context.lineWidththis.lineWidth     start from the first point     context.moveTothis.points[0].x,this.points[0].y     redraw all subsequent points     forvar i1iltthis.points.lengthi         context.lineTothis.points[i].x, this.points[i].y          context.stroke  codepre

If so, how can I correct thisp  pstrongEDIT 2strong According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1385181751634this SO questiona In other words, if I write my own BeanPostProcessor, and that class directly references other beans in the context, then those referenced beans will not be eligible for autoproxying, and a message is logged to that effect. I just checked codeShiroFilterFactoryBeancode and it is in fact a BeanPostProcessor. And the problem is it requires a codeSecurityManagercode instance that in turn requires a codeMainRealmcode instance. So both beans are autowired and are thus ineligible for proxying. I feel like Im closer to the solution but I still cant resolve it.p

Negative 761 pIm using OpenGL 2.0 and an FBO to copy some data from an RGBA texture to an RGB texture, and I ran into an issue where sometimes it corrupts the first few lowest order bits of some of the pixel components during the copy.p  pThe texture copy is broken up into several steps, and Im resizing the FBO.p  pAt first I thought perhaps it was a problem related to the way that I was resizing the FBO, or with the way the the texture is being sampled, but the problem doesnt always occur, and when it does, it never occurs for every pixel copied nor does it ever occur for all of the components of each problematic pixel. In other words, it seems nearly random, except that it is indeed deterministic insomuch that the same errors occur if the same input float values are used during each run of the program.p  pAlso, the problem never, ever occurs if I always use an FBO size of 1x1 which is kind of misleading to know, because it made me think that it was a sampling issue, but, again, that is probably not the case since not every component of every problematic pixel is corrupted. Unfortunately, using an FBO size of 1x1 is absolutely useless in the real world where Im going to be copying a texture containing anything more than a few pixels.p  pThe problem happens on Windows 7 and Ubuntu, and the problem happens when I use MSVC or gs std rand or Mersenne Twister to generate the input texture values  not that how I generate the values should matter, since copy operations are by definition independent of how the data to be copied was generated beforehand ..p  pI wrote a test program see code below where nothing changes between runs of the program other than the input texture values.p  pDoes anyone have an AMD 6310 or any other kind of hardware, really that they can run this test program on Youll have to run it a few times, as sometimes it produces an error, and sometimes it does not. Im just curious if it ever produces the error on your hardware. I just cant spot the pattern, and my naive thinking is that this should either work all of the time, or never  not so sporadically.p  pIm also totally wiling to accept that it might, in the end, have something to do with the way that Im using OpenGL to do the copy. This would be relieving actually, since it would mean that theres an easy and reliable solution. I hope this is the case.p  pI probably have some extraneous calls to glTexParameteri in there somewhere, but I was trying the better safe than sorry method while working on this test program.p  pIn any case, the problem results in some of the pixel components having error thats on the order of like 1e8. Yes, thats a very small error, but its totally unacceptable for what Im doing.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using stdcout using stdendl  include ltiomanipgt using stdiosbase using stdsetprecision using stdfixed  include ltvectorgt using stdvector  include ltstringgt using stdstring  include ltutilitygt using stdpair  include ltcstdlibgt  MSVC chokes if you dont include this before glut.h include ltctimegt  include ltGLglew.hgt include ltGLglut.hgt   Automatically link in the GLUT and GLEW libraries if compiling on MSVC ifdef MSCVER     pragma commentlib, glew32     pragma commentlib, glut32 endif    float distfloat a, float b bool initializefragmentshaderconst string ampfragmentshadercode, GLint ampshader, string amperror void getchunksizesconst sizet numpixels, vectorlt pairltsizet, sizetgt gt ampchunksizes, const bool force1x1chunks, const bool forcesquarechunks  false  string floatbitsstringconst float f      long long unsigned int bitmask  1     long long unsigned int intval  long unsigned intampf      string bits      forsizet i  0 i lt 32 i, bitmask ltlt 1              ifintval amp bitmask             bits  1         else             bits  0           bits  stringbits.rbegin, bits.rend      return bits    int mainint argc, char argv       This program uses an FBO and a fragment shader to copy RGBA pixels from an input array into an RGB output array.      It breaks up the entire pixel copy process into many smaller chunks of a varying number of pixels per chunk.      See line 165 to change the number of pixels in the array right now its hardcoded to be 7 pixels total.       If the chunk sizes are forced to be 1x1 pixels, then there are never any problems with the copy.      See line 186 to change whether the chunks are forced to be 1x1 pixels or not right not they are not being forced as such.           If the chunk sizes are not forced to be 1x1 pixels, then almost all of the time but not quite always      there is a small problem with at least one component of one of the pixels during the copy            The copy is off by a small, nonzero value of practically constant magnitude on the order of 1e8.             Since the values of the pixel components are the only thing that change between runs of the program,      the problem seems to be entirely dependent on the values of the pixel components themselves. This is totally      unexpected  it should always work or always fail to the same degree, regardless of the pixel component values.      While looking at the bit patterns of the problematic pixel component values, it seems that it is always only the      first three to five lowest order bits that do not get copied successfully.            Note that if the values of the pixel components do not change between runs, then the same errors occur,      and so the problem seems to be entirely deterministic. Right now the components are set via PRNG, and are done in a way      so that all of the bits of precision are used see lines 173  176.      See line 86 to alter the PRNG seed.     1 Initialize pseudorandom number generator.     srandtime0  srand0     2 Initialize OpenGL and related objects.     glutInitampargc, argv

Negative 761 pso recently I asked a question to see if a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15956947canmultiplewtapplicationsrunonsameportCan multiple WT applications run on same porta and the answer was a yes, 1 to Jorge Nez for that awesome answer. However, now I am trying to take his solution a step further to see if multiple WT applications can be run on the same page, by embedding them in a kind of host WT application. What I have done is created a host WT application that has an accessor for its root and has a WTabWidget. Then in the CreateHostApplication function I created tabs for the 2 test applications, which also have accessors for their root, and added their root to the tab that belongs to my host application, then after all the apps were added to their individual tabs, I returned the host.p  pThe cool part is that the widgets from the test applications showed up in their tabs as I expected, what I didnt expect is that the connect calls to connect buttons to functions failed. So the widgets are functional as far as clicking them and editing text in boxes goes, but they do nothing else as they are not connected to any custom functions.p  pAfter debugging this for a bit, am pretty sure the connect calls failed on the test apps because they are not actually hosted by the browser, which brings me here. I have not been able to find a solution to this problem, is there a way to get the connect calls functional with this setupp  pThe code below is the solution by Jorge Nez, with the above mentioned modifications. I am using visual studio2010 for development.

Negative 761 pI just wrote an answer to a question p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16639970longestcommonsubsequencewhyisthiswrong1664091316640913longest common subsequence why is this wrongap  pThis function is supposed to find the longest substring between two strings, but when I tried to figure out the worstcase runtime and the input that would cause that, I realized I didnt know.  Consider the code to be C pseudocode. p  precode assume the shorter string is passed in as A int lcschar  A, char  B    int lengtha  strlenA   int lengthb  strlenB     This holds the length of the longest common substring found so far   int longestlengthfound  0     for each character in one string doesnt matter which, look for       incrementally larger strings in the other    once a longer substring can no longer be found, stop   for int aindex  0 aindex lt lengtha  longestlengthfound aindex      for int bindex  0 bindex lt lengthb  longestlengthfound bindex          check the next letter until a mismatch is found or one of the strings ends.       for int offset  0             A[aindexoffset]  0 ampamp               B[bindexoffset]  0 ampamp               A[aindexoffset]  B[bindexoffset]             offset                    longestlengthfound  longestlengthfound gt offset  longestlengthfound  offset                  return longestfoundlength  codepre  pHeres my thinking so farp  pBelow, Ill be assuming A and B are roughly equivalent size as to not have to say ABA, Ill just say n3.  If this is terribly bad, I can update the question.p  pWithout some of the optimizations in the code, I believe the runtime is ABA for a N3 runtime.p  pHowever, if the strings are dissimilar and a long substring is never found, the innermost for loop would drop out to a constant leaving us with AB, rightp  pIf the strings are exactly the same, the algorithm takes linear time, as there is only one simultaneous pass through each of the strings.p  pIf the strings are similar, but not identical, then the longestlengthfound would become a significant fraction of the smaller of A or B, which would divide out one of the factors in the N3 leaving us with N2, right   strongemIm just trying to understand what happens when they are remarkably similar but not identical.emstrongp  pThinking out loud, what if on the first letter, you find a substring with a length around half of the length of A.  This would mean that you would run A2 iterations of the first loop, BA2 iterations of the second loop, and then up to A2 iterations in the third loop assuming the strings were very similar without finding a longer substring.  Assuming roughly even length strings, thats N2  N2  N2  ON3.p  pSample strings which could show this behaviorp  precodeA A A B A A A B A A A B A A A B  A A A A B A A A A B A A A A B A codepre  pAm I close or am I missing something or misapplying somethingp  pIm pretty sure I could do better using a trieprefix tree, but again, Im just really interested in understanding the behavior of this specific code.p

Some of you may heard about a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWeepingAngel relnofollowWeeping Angelsa from Doctor Who.

Problem is, I have no idea about how to do that.p  pAside from the actual question, any tips regarding the effect is appreciated.p  pThank you.p

Currently all player eventscallbacks from each jni player are returned to the java thread running that native player.p  pPlease share your thoughts. Thanks.p

Negative 761 pI have a php page which shows several links as options i.e. a simple menu, but I need to validate the logged in user andor its assigned group to see if they have access to each option.p  pLet me explain with an example.p  pmy menu.php page has a simple html listing of links, e.g.p  precodeoption1.php option2.php option3.php ... optionN.php codepre  p[i am obviating the html code, just showing the logic]p  pNow, each option should be only visible to certain groups and or users. For example, group 1 has access to options 1,2,5, group 2, to options 2,4,5, group 3 to options 1 and 6, userA to options 3,4, userB to options 4,6 and so on.p  pI only need to have permission to either the single user or to their group to give access,  IN other words, its an OR condition, either the group OR the user, not necesarily both.p  pI receive both the user and the group via the SESSION variable, so i can validate it directly.p  pNow, what is the best way to structure the script to validate each options permisionp  pI currently dont have the option to use databases to store the permisions, so i need to do it all within the code hard coded.p  pAn idea I have is to create several arrays, both for each option, and in each to store the ids of each group and user that have access to it, for example.p  precodeoption1Users[1,2,4,5] option1Groups[3,5] option2Users[2,5,7] option2Groups[1,6,12] ... codepre  p... and so on, and then just nest every link with a validation, something likep  precodeif inarrayloggeduser,option1Users  inarrayloggedgroup,option1Groups echo option1.php the html for the option 1 link  codepre  pThat way, each time an option is going to be echoed, i verify if the usergroup has access to it.p  pAlthough it would work this way, I think it is very dirty and with lots of arrays twice for each option. Is there a better way to do all this Is there a common or standard way to achieve it What else besides arrays and plain ifs could i usep  pNotes Each user can belong to several groups and each group can have several users many to many relationship, but this is irrelevant, because I can validate either in the script.p  pthe main menu.php already HAS database validation to access to it, based on the Group of the user if the group doesnt have permissions, the user simply cannot enter the menu, but currently it only works to allow access to the menu itself, but within it, i need to validate again what specific options that usergroup can see.p  pI currently need the solution to be hardcoded i know, dirty, but i need the script to validate everything on its own, not depending on databases to know the permissions, but if you have a solution involving databases and storing the permissions there, feel free to mention it , and how to implement it.p  pthanks.p

Negative 761 h2Situationh2  pAs you can see in the screenshot below, I have an area of my site which makes use of tabs to split up the user dashboard.

However, when I go back to reedit, the selected option continues to be the first option in the dropdown.p  pI stepped through the code and verified that the data is properly retrieved from the database.  Ive even gone so far as converting the strongHtml.DropDownListForstrong to strongHtml.EditorForstrong and confirmed that the value stored in the database is making it to the view as expected.p  pIve used strongHtml.DropDownListForstrong when the property associated with it was an integer value but never when its an integer value thats part of a collection of objects.  I would be apprehensive about what Ive done so far, but everything appears to be working with this one key issue.p  pSo far, Ive tried moving the SelectList in PreviewImageEdit into GridDetailEdit and initializing them separately where Ive programmatically set the Selected value for the appropriate SelectedListItem.  That didnt work... same result.p  pHas anyone come across this issue  Any suggestions on the best way to resolve thisp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pBelow is the snippet of code that populates GridDetailTypesListp  precodevar gridDetailTypes  db.GridDetailTypes.OrderByg gt g.DisplayOrder.ToList return new SelectListgridDetailTypes, GridDetailTypeId, Name codepre  pIts pretty straightforward.  The second parameter of the SelectList constructor represents the field whose values should be used in the value attribute.  I dont believe the issue is related to the fact that the value field is an integer as I have similar code on the same page and that dropdown is functioning properly.  The only difference is that my problem dropdowns are within a collection of my ViewModel.p

Negative 761 pI written a Kiosk style C application using visual studio that is run on startup and should expand to fullscreen and cover the taskbar.p  pI am doing the usual setting boarder style to none, and fill extents and it works perfectly if I just launch the application manually.p  pWhen the application launches on startup by way of a shortcut in the startup folder in the start menu, the taskbar ends up on top of the program and clicking somewhere on the form does not bring the form back to the top.p  pHas anyone encountered this problem before, or know of possible workarounds.p
Negative 761 pI have an array of activities stored as codescope.activitiescode. Im iterating over these in an ngrepeat, accessing nested values and objects along the way.p  pSome of these nested objects have actions associated with them, such as liking and rsvping, when then makes a call to my backend and should update the value within the ngrepeat. That logic looks like thisp  precodescope.rsvpToEvent  functioneventId              eventService.rsvpeventId, rootScope.user.id.thenfunction data                  for var i  0 i lt scope.activities.length i                      ifscope.activities[i].event                          ifscope.activities[i].event.id  data.id                              scope.activities[i].event  data                             break                                                                            ,             function errorMessage                        codepre  pIve also tried passing codeindexcode to the function and accessing that activity directly, rather than having the for loop.p  pThis executes successfully and updates the value if I console.log it, but its not updating the dom or the values of the ngrepeat. Im using similar logic on another page and its working fine, so Im assuming its due to the fact that Im trying to update a nested object like this the other pages logic isnt on nested objects.p  pOther similar questions have said its a problem with the scope not getting updated. However, if I wrap this in codescope.applycode or call it afterwards, I get the digest already in progress error. If I try to do a safe scope apply by checking the phase, it just doesnt get called at all since a digest is already in progress. Is there another approach to this to ensure that the domngrepeat will get updatedp
Negative 761 pIm looking for a datatype which will be used as an Index, it should be 16 bits in 32bit os and 32bits in 64bit OS.

And either Im braindead right now, or I actually observed stronga nonsequential behavior in sequential code executionstrong. p  pstrongCodesstrong p  precodeLINE6851     ifselfgtgarbage  0  LINE6852            spenvlistfreechildrenselfgtgarbage LINE6853            spenvlistdelselfgtgarbage LINE6854            spenvfreeselfgtgarbage, sizeofspenvlistt LINE6855     End of if LINE6856   End of an outer if structure LINE6857 End of the function call containing the if structure codepre  pIll explain the free and del funcs after the debugging trace.p  pstrongDebugging Tracestrongp  precode6851   if selfgtgarbage  0  gdb step 6852   spenvlistfreechildrenselfgtgarbage gdb print selfgtgarbage  1  spenvlistt  0x649080 gdb step 6853   spenvlistdelselfgtgarbage  gdb print selfgtgarbage  2  spenvlistt  0x649080 gdb step 6854      spenvfreeselfgtgarbage, sizeofspenvlistt   gdb print selfgtgarbage  3  spenvlistt  0x649080 gdb step 6857    gdb print selfgtgarbage  4  spenvlistt  0x649080 gdb step spprivate11del selfltvalue optimized outgt at spmoddftint32.c6854 6854      spenvfreeselfgtgarbage, sizeofspenvlistt   gdb print selfgtgarbage  Cannot access memory at address 0x18 gdb step Single stepping until exit from function spenvfree,  which has no line number information.

Since selfgarbage has been freed completely, this should be where the strongdouble free or corruptionstrong happens. However, the entire function is sequential with no loops.

I hope someone can at least confirm my observation of the nonsequential behavior is accurate. Thanks so muchp

Negative 761   pIve been wondering about memory usage and garbage collection in JavaScript when returning new temporary objects. Say I have a function that returns multiple valuesp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction foo      return  a 0, b 1, c 2   codepre  pThis creates a new Object every time the function is called. Now, if Im only interested in the return values, I dont really need that object, so I thought of a different patternp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodefunction barresult      result.a  0     result.b  1     result.c  2  codepre  pIn theory, bar should save some memory over foo. In fact I saw this pattern a few times in real world applications, e.g. in three.js there are optionalTarget parameters in the Ray class so the functions dont have to create new vectors inside and instead set the result on the target a hrefhttpsgithub.commrdoobthree.jsblobmastersrcmathRay.jsL56 relnofollowRay.js sourcea.p  pHowever, after fiddling around with custom benchmarks, I cannot find any differences in practice. Im a total novice in benchmarking Javascript, so the question is Can you create a convincing benchmark to show the difference, if any If there is none, does this mean the garbage collector is smart enough to throw away the object immediatelyp
Negative 761 pWhen I open my HTML file by double clicking the file then it open in Chrome, theres nothing wrong with it a hrefhttpprntscr.com2aayyt relnofollowherea but when I access it with localhost url using Chrome the checkboxes changed like a hrefhttpprntscr.com2aaz01 relnofollowthisa and when I access it with localhost url using Firefox it looks normal. I tried to remove all the CSS and Javascript but it still the same. Anyone knows why Thanks Ive been stressed about it. Anyway Im using XAMPP on my local server.p

Negative 761 pFirst, some background on this question Today, I was looking for an explanation of how test works in assembly. Unfortunately, I cant seem to find an answer in google, because test, assembly, etc. are all common words that are too often used in other cases. Eventually I found some information by searching for conditional branch, which isnt quite what Im looking for, but is a good enough starting place.p  pMy question for you is, where do I go for information on low level computer operations e.g. if I want to find out how a branch statement works, or how the cpu cache functions, or what happens to the extra bit when you shift a register How do I search for thesep

Negative 761 pIm trying to make simple WPF app with c and I have following problem in my app Im using class Macierz to represent and work with array of BigInteger objects. Now I need to graphically represent this array, using DataGrid or something different if there is a better way to do this and I have no idea how can I bound this DataGrid to my class. I had tried to do this by Data Sources window VS 2013 but when I added my class to it my array didnt display. Here is some code of my classp  precodepublic class Macierz      public Macierzulong A, ulong B              a  A         b  B         M  new BigInteger[A, B]            private ulong a, b     public ulong A              get                      return a                    public ulong B              get                      return b                    private BigInteger[,] M      public BigInteger this[ulong A, ulong B]              get                      return M[A, B]                  set                      M[A, B]  value               codepre  pI need to represent in array with cells of textBoxes or something like that, so a user can easily change value of specific cell.p  pEdit Now, thanks to user3148019 answer I added this method in my classp  precode public DataTable ToDataTable              DataTable table  new DataTable         DataRow tmp         for ulong i  0 i lt b i             table.Columns.Addi.ToString, typeofBigInteger          for ulong i  0 i lt a i                      tmp  table.NewRow             for ulong j  0 j lt b j                 tmp[j.ToString]  M[i, j]              table.Rows.Addtmp                  return table      codepre  pso now I can show my array using DataGrid but this requires twice more memory and user cant change any values in original array. I tried to change my class replacing simple BigInteger[a, b] array with DataTable object but I have problem with accessing specific cells. For examplep  precodepublic BigInteger tmp  0 for ulong i  0 i lt a i              for ulong j  0 j lt b j                              tmp  table.Rows[i].ItemArray[j]              codepre  pThis generate errorsp  blockquote   pError 1   The best overloaded method match for System.Data.DataRowCollection.this[int] has some invalid argumentsbr   Error  2   Argument 1 cannot convert from ulong to intp blockquote  pIs number of rows and columns in DataTable object limited to max of int or there is another way to access DataTable membersp  pEdit2br I should say it earlier, that Macierz will never change any value inside array, so only user can change values of cell witch means I dont need INotifyCollectionChange or maybe am I wrong. Also now I think that showing full array is not always necessary. I dont want Macierz to derive from DependencyObject because I want to use it in other console application. I want to achieve my goal in simplest way. This is what I have now in Macierzp  precode public DataTable ToDataTableulong AStart, ulong ACount, ulong BStart, ulong BCount              if AStart gt a             AStart  a  1         if BStart gt b             BStart  b  1          ulong AStop  AStart  ACount         ulong BStop  BStart  BCount          if AStop gt a             AStop  a         if BStop gt b             BStop  b          DataTable table  new DataTable         DataRow tmp         BigInteger BItmp          for ulong i  BStart i lt BStop i             table.Columns.Addi.ToString, typeofBigInteger         table.Columns.AddSuma, typeofBigInteger          for ulong i  AStart i lt AStop i                      tmp  table.NewRow             for ulong j  BStart j lt BStop j                 tmp[j.ToString]  M[i, j]              BItmp  0             for ulong j  0 j lt B j                 BItmp  M[i, j]             tmp[Suma]  BItmp               table.Rows.Addtmp                  return table      codepre  pand in MainWindow.xaml.csp  precodeprivate void PokazButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              this.Cursor  Cursors.Wait          if czyCala.IsChecked  true             GridTabela  M.ToDataTable0, M.A, 0, M.B         else             GridTabela  M.ToDataTableVA, VACount, VB, VBCount          TabelaDataGrid.DataContext  this         TabelaDataGrid.ItemsSource  GridTabela.DefaultView          this.Cursor  null      codepre  pThis is working very well, allowing me to display array to user in easy way, but I dont now how to allow user change values in original array.

Negative 761 pWe found when moving from Jetty in development to Tomcat in production that our Swagger documentation stopped working  no operations would show up in the Swagger docs until after the first call to the servlet providing the operation.p  pAfter some work in the debugger we traced the problem to the servlets codeinitcode method not getting called. I assume that Jetty was treating all servlets as loadonstartup, whereas Tomcat isnt, unless you explicitly tell it to in the web.xml.p  pUnfortunately, in the web.xml, the only things you can set as loadonstartup are servlets, and there are no actual servlets in our Scalatra web.xml, only listeners and servletmappings.p  pHow can we get Scalatra to initialize our various codeScalatraServletscode on startupp  hr  pstrongNotestrong Were on Scalatra 2.2.2.

Negative 761 pI have a project idea which is suggested by my lecturer to create an adhoc mobile network using WiFidirect available in android mobile phones. the purpose of this network is to send data over a long distance from one android device to another using several other android devices as intermediate nodes and also to use a MANET routing protocol for path selection when theres more than one path available to reach the destination.  I have looked into some of the questions related to this where some have asked how to implement a similar type of network but most of those answers were pretty old at which time WiFidirect was not available widely, as I assume.  Im pretty much new to android and Im learning it now for this purpose. so I would like to know weather this can be done using an android app, some guidelines to start if possible and any sample codes i can refer to get this done.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 761 pI have an array in c and I need to perform some operation only if the elements in an array have changed. However the time and memory taken for this is very important. I realized that an efficient way to do this would probably be to hash all the elements of the array and compare the result with the previous result. If they match that means the elements dont change. I would however like to know if this is the most efficient way of doing things. Also since the array is only 8 bytes long1 byte for each element which hashing function would be least time consumingp  pThe elements in an array are actually being received from another microcontroller. So they may or may not change depending on whether what the other microcontroller measured is the same or not p

Negative 761 pI have a ASP.Net MVC controller and it calls a method that will post a purchase order.  However I want the purchase order posting to take place in the background, I dont want the controller to wait for the purchase order to post before returning.  The posting takes a long time and there really is nothing the user of the website can do if there is a error, somebody else needs to be alerted.p  pIt seemed like a good case for using the C await and async functionality, but I am struggling to get it to work.  I tried to setup the method that posts the purchase order as a asynchronous method.  However I am running into the following problemsp  ul liThe class that has the method that post the purchase order implements a interface.  The controller is using the interface and you cannot put async on a method in a interface.

Negative 761 pWe have a product made of two components. A WEB API site hosted under IIS 8 which I call it API. This site provides services to multiple sites however at the moment only one web site is using it. The other component of this site is a ASP.NET MVC .NET 4 site that is at the moment the only client of the API site. Lets call it WEB. p  pWhen we deployed the API and WEB to a single server with production capacity everything was fine until when the number of concurrent users exceeded 16 Then the site became unresponsive which means that we did not get a Timeout or any other errors and the browser was waiting for a response for good. p  pWe reproduced the same issue in our staging environment using an online load test web site. Again the site becomes unresponsive when the number of concurrent users exceeds 12 or 16 or higher.p  pWhen this happens the site kind of dies for like 10 minutes and then becomes responsive. I guess this is because the App Poll gets recycled p  pThe question is that how can I know if the problem resides in the API or in WEB  Then what could be the possible issue  WEB totally relies on API and does not connect to any databases directly but API is using MySql on AWS.p

Negative 761 pI have two sets of data. One set of data is a matrix containing different samples in each row and information regarding each sample in the columns, one of these columns contains longitude data and another one contains latitude data for the sample. The other dataset consists of three grids. One grid contains the latitude of the data, the second grid contains the longitude of the data and the third grid, the data for the 1 latitude longitude grid. p  pWhat I would like is to find out which data in the second dataset corresponds with the data in the second dataset. What I mean by this, is if a sample falls into a particular grid of the second dataset, the data in this grid needs to be extracted and it needs to be known for what sample the data applies.p  pSo just say in the grid between latitudes 60 and 59, and longitudes 100 and 101 sample x falls. Just say the data in the gridded dataset is 10 for this particular grid. I would like to know that 10 the data in the grid applies to sample x.p  pIn the end I would like to have the grid data that corresponds to a sample in a new matrix that could act as a partner to the sample dataset ie. if sample x is in row 40 then in the matrix 10 is in row 40, or alternatively added to the same dataset as a new column. Keeping in mind that some samples will fall into the same grid.p  pIm fairly inexperienced in matlab, I have tried the brushing tool but this does not work for this example. All I could think of that could potentially work is round each long and lat in the sample data to an even number and then find which samples overlap in long and lat and then intersect the long in the sample data with the long grid and then do the same for the lat grid finding the row and column each sample falls into and then find the data for each sample. This seems like a long way to go about it and Im not too sure how well it would work as well.p  pI have completed this method and it has worked to an extent.... I have the rows and columns in which the data is for each sample ie. sample x can be found in row 8 column 100. However when I try and extract this data from the grid it is not a matrix containing one column but many columns, the answer is still in the sample place of the matrix. How do I go about taking one data point from each row of a grid and ending up with a matrix of only one column or one row in which I can turn into a columnp  pThank youp
Negative 761 pI am using the plugin linked below as a portfolio. You click a thumbnail and it expands a div to reveal content, which pushes down any thumbnails below it.

Needless to say, the service runs fine locally, but throws an exception when installed and run on the server.p  pI need my project to reference version 14. p  pMy question is, is it possible to download the appropriate Interop dll without upgrading to Office 2013 on the server, or downgrading to Office 2010 on my machinep

Negative 761 pHi iam creating an android application.

Only way i know is send parameters through codeListltNameValuePairgtcode so im trying to convert JSONObject to codeListltNameValuePairgtcode. Can anybody provide a method which can directly convert my JSONObject to codeListltNameValuePairgtcode. Is there any predefined method for doing this. Or can any one provide solution where i can directly send by JSONObject to PHP and retrieve there.p

Negative 761 pIf I take a photo of a white block that reads RGB of 255,255,255 and an HSV of 0,0,100.p  pNow I take a second photo of a purple block inside of different lighting conditions the RGB turns out to be 79, 40, 145 and an HSV of 262,72,56.

Should the property have the type ContentControl I couldnt really find an answer to this. And by changing this to DataBinding, would the error with the thread ownage be solvedp  pEDIT 2 The project structure is as following Main View is entry point, in the constructor the data context is set to the mainviewmodel, which is created at that time. the main view has a contentcontrol, where I swap between my usercontrols, in this case my views.p  pfrom my mainviewmodel I set the content of the contentcontrol in the beginning at the usercontrol login, which creates a viewmodel in its contructors and sets it as datacontext.p  pThe code snippets are from my loginviewmodel. Hope this helps.p  pEDIT 3 I thougt I found a workaround, but it still does not work. I forgot, how the timer works in the background, so it can be solved that way either.p

If I make edits using Python but NOT with BeautifulSoup i.e. string operations it also works fine. it seems that writing the output string with BeautifulSoup causes the problem.p  pIs this some kind of encoding issue Whats the difference between a string obtained from the BeautifulSoup object and a normal string read straight from a filep

Negative 761 pI am building a cross platform app using PhoneGap Build, version 3.3.0. The app is a news app, so requires updating of the DOM as different views are loaded. Every time this happens the old page is removed and replaced by the new view render. The app is built around backbone.js , using jQuery and Twig to render the views. p  pI am using the inAppBrowser to handle links to external sites, and have successfully set these up, usingp  precodeltgapplugin nameorg.apache.cordova.inappbrowser gt codepre  pin the config, and a link to p  precodeltscript srcphonegap.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pin the index.html file. I am then launching the inAppBroswer using p  precodewindow.openmyURL, blank, locationyes codepre  pand this works fine the first time I use it in a session. Even if the browser is then closed and another link on the same view is selected, the browser still works.p  pHowever, in iOS 6, if the view is then replaced by another view, then the links in the new view do not fire. The onclick event attached to the link is definitely firing I can tell by using alerts, but the inAppBroswer does not open. However, if I exit the app and then return to it, the inAppBroswer has opened. It is as if losing the focus on the app fires off the queued event.p  pI have confirmed this behaviour by placing an alert in the loadstart event handler, this does not fire until exiting the app and returning to it.p  pI have tried keeping a persistent reference to the the inAppBrowser and destroying the instance after it has has closed. I have also tried calling the code.showcode method after creating the inAppBroswer instance, but none of this seems to make any difference.p  pIs this an issue that anyone else has come across I could not find another question about this specific issue. This only seems to happen in iOS 6 and 7, not in Android.p  pThanksp

Negative 761 pI am working on image processing in R. I have written a function in R which reads a text file and generates a color map using the coordinate information and intensity values for each coordiante within that file. To represent these images I am using the rainbow color scheme at the moment. However, I want to represent the images using a plus minus color scheme. Meaning, I need a color scheme with neutral central color black, diverging either side to warm colors red for positive values, and cold colours for negative ones blue. I tried to do this using the colorRamp package but somehow I am unable to get this color scheme.

Negative 761 pI waw wondering what could be some of the common pitfalls that a novice go programmer could fall in when writing unintentionally slow go code.p  p1 First, I know that in python doing string concatenation can be or used to be expensive, is that the same in go when trying to add one element to a string As in helloWorld.p  p2 The other issue is that I find myself very often having to extend my slice with a list of more bytes rather than 1 byte at a time. I have a dirty way of appending it by doing the followingp  pcodenewStr  stringarrayOfBytes  stringnewBytesToAppendcodep  pIs that way slower than just doing something likep  precodefor , b  range newBytesToAppend     arrayOfBytes  appendarrayOfBytes, b  codepre  pOr is there a better way to append whole slices to other slices or maybe a built in way It just seems to me a little odd that I would even have to write my own extend function or even benchmark itp  pAlso, sometimes I end up having to loop through every element of the byte slice and for readability, I change the type of that current byte to a string. As inp  precodefor , b  range newBytesToAppend     c  stringb     some more logic on c     logicc logic  codepre  p3 I was wondering, if strongconverting typesstrong in go is expensive specially between string to arrays and if that might be one of the factors that might be making the code slow. Btw, sometimes I change types to strings strongverystrong often, nearly every iteration.p  pBut more generally, I was trying to search for the web a list of hints of what often are things that makes go code slow and was trying to change it so that it wouldnt but didnt have that much luck. I am very much aware that this depends from application to application, but was wondering if there are any expert advice on what usually makes novice go code slow.p  p4 The last thing I can think of is, that sometimes I do know in advance the length of the slice, so I could just use arrays with fixed length. Could that change anything p  p5 I have also made my own types as inp  precodetype Num int codepre  por p  precodetype Name string codepre  pDo those hinder performancep  p6 Is there a general list of heuristic to watch out in go for code optimization For example, is dereferencing a problem as it can be in Cp

Negative 761 pI have a preview that is WpxHp, I want to take HxW pictures, thus I want the user to see a preview window that has the same aspect ratio of the picture Ill take, not the one of the preview.  How can I crop the preview using the TextureView  p  p editp  pwhat I thought is to use a scale Matrix to distort the image so as to cmpensate for the TextureView resize, let me explain betterbr I have a target preview image size that is W,H. Therefore I need to resize the TextureView to W,H. This implies a distortion that simply is a non uniform linear scaling representable by the matrix S. Therefore if I scale the image with invS before resizing the view I should obtain the same original dimensions of the Preview thus the same aspect ratio but with the TextureView resized and this is equivalent to a crop.  I tried and it seems to work, but Im looking for an alternative wayp
Negative 761 pIm faced with performance issues when calling an onFocus function within an html tag. I normally dont call functions in this manner, but I am not working with my own code. p  pUsing jQuery 1.4.2p  pI have two questionsp  p1. Does calling functions within html tags really decrease performance For examplep  precode    ltinput typetext onFocusjavascriptmoveCursorToEndthis.id gt codepre  p2.  What I would like to do is move the cursor to the end of an input when the user focuses on the input field. However, the target device does not react properlyiPad 2 using Safari. The cursor still moves to the position that is clicked and it takes approx. 15 seconds for the function to finish.p  pI have not really found any clean, cross browser compatible ways to move the cursor to the end of an input field.p  precode    function moveCursorToEndid       var currentElementid       var currentValuecurrentElement.val       currentElement.focus.valString.fromCharCode35.valcurrentValue        codepre  pThen I call the function like thisp  precode    ltinput typetext onFocusjavascriptmoveCursorToEndthis.id gt codepre  pIs there a better way to do this, while sitll calling the function from an html tagp

Negative 761 pOk, there appears to be few approaches to destroying a users session and there may be subtleties between them and how the app handles user sessions. p  pFirst, why is it most examples dont use codesession.deletecurrentuseridcode to delete the codecurrentuseridcode value and its hash key A typical example looks like the below I added deleting codereturntocode since if signing out, why would there by a need to track a returnto value. p  precode  def signout     self.currentuser  nil     session[currentuserid]  nil     session.deletereturnto   end codepre  pIf the app needs to delete all session variables and values, isnt it safer to simply use codesession  nilcode or codesession.destroycode This will destroy the hash entirely. It would make sense to keep codecurrentuseridcode in your session hash if your app supports... say tracking of anonymous users p  pThoughts p
Negative 761 pI am using Cordova 2.2.0 and Eclipse to create an Android app that uses HTML5 localStorage. Ive noticed a strange problem that I havent seen asked on this website before. The app consists of 2 pages with a button on each. When one of the buttons is pressed it should increment the locally stored variable window.localStorage.count by 1 and alert me to its new value. p  pFor instance when I first open the app and press the button on page1 twice, the variable should be equal to 2. Then when I navigate to the second page and press the button there twice again the variable is equal to 4. So far this works correctly the very first time I use the app after running it from Eclipse on my device, however the problem occurs when I go back to the first page again. If I press the button once on page1 the variable is now 3 only incremented from the value set on its page and ignoring page2 and if I navigate to the second page once again and press the button a single time I get a value of 5 as if ignoring what happens on the other page1. It seems the variable is being stored separately on each page and acts as 2 separate variables despite both pages being linked to the same javascript file.p  pThis works perfectly using PhoneGap in iOS even if I quit the app and on web browsers that Ive tested like Chrome and Safari. Can anyone describe why this behaviour is occurring Ive tried removing window. from the localStorage part but this has not had an effect.p  pIm using a Samsung Galaxy s3 mini with Android version 4.1.2. Im also using regular jQuery in the app.p  pJavascript filep  precodewindow.localStorage.count iftypeof window.localStorage.count  undefined window.localStorage.count  0  function incrementCount      window.localStorage.count     alertwindow.localStorage.count  codepre  pPage1 HTMLp  precodeltbutton onClickincrementCountgtAdd to Countltbuttongt ltbutton onClicklocation.hrefpage2.htmlgtGo to Page 2ltbuttongt codepre  pPage2 HTMLp  precodeltbutton onClickincrementCountgtAdd to Countltbuttongt codepre  pIn case it helps I only use one permission in the AndroidManifest.xml which isp  precodeltusespermission androidnameandroid.permissions.ACCESSNETWORKSTATE gt codepre  pOnce again I cant explain why this is happening.

It is much more beneficial to receive a detailed explanation than simply a line of code saying here you go I fixed it. I will be linking this post in my submission, and we do have very strict rules about academic integrity and what is copying vs helping, and Id really appreciate if that were kept in mind.p  pThe purpose of this project is to create a vigenere cipher. Below are the instructions my teacher providedp  pYour final challenge this week is to write, in vigenere.c, a program that encrypts messages using Vigenres cipher. This program must accept a single commandline argument a keyword, k, composed entirely of alphabetical characters. If your program is executed without any commandline arguments, with more than one commandline argument, or with one commandline argument that contains any nonalphabetical character, your program should complain and exit immediately, with main returning 1 thereby signifying an error that our own tests can detect. Otherwise, your program must proceed to prompt the user for a string of plaintext, p, which it must then encrypt according to Vigenres cipher with k, ultimately printing the result and exiting, with main returning 0.p  pAs for the characters in k, you must treat A and a as 0, B and b as 1,  , and Z and z as 25. In addition, your program must only apply Vigenres cipher to a character in p if that character is a letter. All other characters numbers, symbols, spaces, punctuation marks, etc. must be outputted unchanged. Moreover, if your code is about to apply the jth character of k to the ith character of p, but the latter proves to be a nonalphabetical character, you must wait to apply that jth character of k to the next alphabetical character in p you must not yet advance to the next character in k. Finally, your program must preserve the case of each letter in p.p  pIm pretty sure I hit the requirements for iterating through the code, making sure the key loops if its shorter than the phrase being encrypted, and making sure that Im not applying the key to nonalpha characters. However, I get a segmentation default before prompted to enter a string to encrypt, so Im pretty sure the problem lies in the top half of the code. Ive looked over the code quite a bit and I still cant figure out why it keeps segfaulting.p

Negative 761 pPlease be kind when critiquing my db structure, as this started out as pure curiosity and grew beyond my scope quickly. I am using MS Access front end to MySQL back end, replicated in a MASTER2MASTER set up. Server 1 autoincrements by even numbers and Server 2 by odd. There are three users on separate machines, all with their own installation of the front end, all querying the database at the same time. I have three Innodb tables whereby table1 has a foreign key in the other two tables.

Once I commit the transaction in Ms Access, a report prints the new rows from the three tables on one report. p  pThe issue is that roughly 2 out of every 100 entries gets lost andor overwritten, even though Ms Access prints out the information correctly. What I means is that User1 and USer2 may process simultaneous inserts on table1. Both print out a report with the same tbl1IDseq but different tbl2ID and tbl3IDs. However, only one process is actually saved to the database and no error is thrown for the second unsuccessful set of inserts. I reviewed the bin log file and there is but one insert, and SHOW SLAVE STATUS shows no errors. If MS Access is able to commit both transactions with no errors for both users and then print out a report from the newly updated database, how can this be Any ideasp

Negative 761 pI have an application that uses RabbitMQ as the message queue to sendreceive message between two components sender and receiver. The sender sends message in a very fast way. The receiver receives the message and then does some very timeconsuming task mainly database writing for very large data size. Since the receiver takes a very long time to finish the task and then retrieve the next message in the queue, the sender will keep filling up the queue quickly. So my question is Will this cause the message queue to overflow p  pThe message consumer looks like the followingp  precodepublic void onMessage throws IOException, InterruptedException      channel.exchangeDeclareEXCHANGENAME, fanout     String queueName  channel.queueDeclareallDataCase, true, false, false, null.getQueue     channel.queueBindqueueName, EXCHANGENAME,       QueueingConsumer consumer  new QueueingConsumerchannel     channel.basicConsumequeueName, true, consumer      while true          QueueingConsumer.Delivery delivery  consumer.nextDelivery         String message  new Stringdelivery.getBody         System.out.println [x] Received   message            JSONObject json  new JSONObjectmessage         String caseID  json.getStringcaseID         following takes very long time                     dao.saveToDBcaseID       codepre  pEach message received by the consumer contains a caseID. For each caseID, it will save large amount of data to the database, which takes very long time. Currently only one consumer is set up for the RabbitMQ since producerconsumer use the same queue for the publishsubscribe of caseID. So how can I speed up the consumer throughput so that the consumer can catch up with the producer and avoid the message overflow in the queue Should I use multithreading in the consumer part to speed up the consumption rate Or should I use multiple consumers to consume the incoming message simutaneously Or is there any asynchronous way to let the consumer consume the message asynchronously without waiting it to finish Any suggestions are welcome. p

Negative 761 pIm working on a TCPIP stack for a networks course, and am currently working on implementing a rudimentary TCP system. With IP and UDP you get fields in the header that allow you to know the number of bytes in the payload, but as far as I can see, there is nothing like this in TCP. The client will send a value in the window size field during the opening handshake to indicate the maximum number of bytes it will accept, but there is no field that actually says how many bytes of data come after the header in a given packet.p  pSequence and acknowledgment numbers are used to give the offset of bytes being sent and the next expected offset, but they cannot tell you how many bytes have come in the current packet.p  pIm assuming I can just pass the length from the IP header down to the TCP handler, but Id just like to verify that thats the proper way to do it.p

Negative 761 pI need to find if a given string matches strings in a list without having the strings in the list basically I need to hash the strings and match only against the list of hashes. The problem is being sure that there are no false positives so that only exact matches will be found and any other set of characters is not found. This is of course easy with an actual list of strings, even a simple binary search will work, but I want an algorithm that works without the actual characters present i.e. precalculated. A bloom filter doesnt have a guarantee that some arbitrary set of characters might not be matched.p  pUpdate this is similar to storing only password hashes and then hashing an entered password which is then compared to the hash list to see if the password is one of them admittedly not the usual use of a password. The reason for this requirement is to no have to ship the actual text, just the hashes.p  pUpdate 2 Is there another way to do this without a perfect hash function I have hundreds of thousands of entries, finding a perfect hash is hard. Maybe something like a bloom filter but with a better guaranteep

Negative 761 pIn a project where for instance a parser is involved, some source code is the product of a program. For instance codeyacccode generates  based on a code.yycode file, a source code file that implements the parser.p  pSince small modifications in the code.yycode file can lead to large changes in the corresponding source code file after compilation and since  the resulting source code is almost never altered after it is generated. Such source code files are perfect candidates for the code.gitignorecode list.p  pNow one can of course write such files manually to the listp  precodelexer1.cpp parser1.cpp lexer2.cpp parser2.cpp codepre  pBut it is likely when one builds a new parser, heshe will forget to add the file to the list.p  pIs there a way to emspecifyem a pattern that acts as followsp  blockquote   pGiven a file codefoo.ext1code exists, ignore codefoo.ext2code.p blockquote  pWhere one thus provides codeext1code and codeext2code.

Negative 761 pI have a serious problem with android request to local host Asmx .net service. I have written an asmx service and have deployed on the local IIS server. I generated classes from the wsdl document using WSDL2Code for android to call actions on the server from my android application. Now I receive a complex parameter on the server side but nested collection in the parameter object has zero items. The remaining properties in the parameter are fine. Actually I am saving a survey object and sending it to the asmx service as a parameter. The Survey class contains Survey name, Introduction and a collection of questions where every question is a complex object in it self. When I send survey object to the service I get it at the server side and it contains survey name and introduction but the questions collection has zero items. I am sending request from eclips emulator.

Negative 761 pI have a use case is to host a hrefhttpsgithub.comnandananandana.github.iotreemasterfoaf relnofollowa set of filesa same RDF content with different serialization formats such as RDFXML, Turtle, and JSONLD in Github pages and use a hrefhttpsw3id.org relnofollowa w3id URLa as a permanent identifier. p  pFurther, I want to have content negotiation on that permanent URL. This would be trivial if I hosted my files in an Apache server but unfortunately Github pages dont support content negotiation. So I am trying to see to which extent I can do that with URL rewriting rules. p  pSo the idea is similar to the following. p  precodeGET httpw3id.orgfoo   redirect to gt httpfoo.git.iocontent.ttl Accept textturtle  GET httpw3id.orgfoo   redirect to gt httpfoo.git.iocontent.jsonld Accept applicationldjson codepre  pCurrently my rules look like the following.p  precodeOptions FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine on RewriteCond HTTPACCEPT .applicationrdfxml.  RewriteRule foaf httpnandana.github.iofoafcard.rdf [R303,L] RewriteCond HTTPACCEPT .textturtle.  RewriteRule foaf httpnandana.github.iofoafcard.ttl [R303,L] RewriteCond HTTPACCEPT .applicationldjson.  RewriteRule foaf httpnandana.github.iofoafcard.jsonld [R303,L] RewriteRule foaf httpnandana.github.iofoafcard.html [R303,L] codepre  pThough this works for majority of the cases, it would break for some corner cases. For example, if there is an accept header like the following p  precodeAccept applicationrdfxmlq0.9,textturtle codepre  pThis will return applicationrdfxml because the first rule matches though according to the content negotiation it should return turtle. Does anyone know a way to improve the rules to handle this corner casep

Negative 761 pIm at a performance bottleneck in my program where I need to access elements from an array millions of times in a tight loop.p  pI looked around and the general consensus seems to be that even though multidimensional arrays emshouldem be faster, their underlying implementation is inefficient so just use jagged arrays instead. I profiled it and sure enough, jagged arrays are 50 faster. Fine.p  pHowever, I also tried just doing manual indexing as in, simulating the behavior of a multidimensional array by just doing something like this codeobject value  array[i  24  j] where 24 is an array sizecode and accessing it through a singledimension array with multiplication to simulate multidimensional arrays.p  pSurprisingly, this was also faster than a jagged array by around 15 for accesses all I care about. This saddens me because for one, it seems silly that manually recreating multidimensional arrays is this much faster than Cs builtin implementation and two, the math involved to get to indicies is uglier compared to just indexing with jaggedmultidimensional arrays.p  pIs there anything I can do to recoup the speed benefits without having to use my own manual indexing Surely there is some sort of optimization that can be set or checked to simulate this behavior Why is the C implementation of arrays so inefficientp
Negative 761 pThe objective of the following scripts are to send an Asynchronous PHPCurl Request to a Server. Ive been using the strongfire and forgetstrong technique in where a CURL request is sent to the server itself with a strongTIMEOUTMS set to 100strong. The mainProcess.php will proceed as is with a delay of only 100 milliseconds and the sendMe.php will send a Curl to server C without delaying the execution of the mainProcess.php script. p  pI used another script benchMarking.php to print the execution time of firing the overall procedures.p  pbenchMarking.phpp  precodetimestart  microtimetrue PHPCurl Post to Server B mainProcess.php timeend  microtimetrue time  timeend  timestart echo time codepre  pInitially, the strongtimestrong is low. But as I continuously fire the benchMarking.php the time strongincreasesstrong. Resetting the Apache Server Server B is the only option in order to decrease the time variable again. Hence, it must have something to do with the resources or connection handling of PHP.

Negative 761 pSelenium has a convenient mechanism for pulling dozens or hundreds of elements from the DOM fairly efficiently and in a single fast roundtripp  precodebuttons  driver.findelementsbycssselectorbutton codepre  pThe result codebuttonscode can be a list of dozens or hundreds of elements without any problem.p  pBut things slow to a crawl if you want to filter the elements using codeisdisplayedcode or as Java calls it, codeisElementDisplayedcode because every call to the method involves a roundtrip back to the browser. Even on my fastest development machine each such call takes about 0.1s, which means that the following filter across 100 elements takes 10 seconds p  precode[b.isdisplayed for b in buttons] codepre  pThe same problem happens if you want to look for a button with particular text, because each lookup of the code.textcode attribute in fact invokes a property with its own roundtrip back to the browserp  precode[Subscribe in b.text for b in buttons] codepre  pThis makes it difficult to write robust Selenium tests which pay attention to the two things that are really userfacing about the DOM whether an element is visible, and what text it contains. While pivoting entirely away from visibility and text content  say, to unique IDs or combinations of classes or document location  would make our tests run faster, it would be creating an invisible link between our Selenium tests and the button it was looking for, instead of letting our tests keep their eye on the user experience and what users can see and read on the screen.p  pMy questionp  ul lipIs there any way to either apply codeisdisplayedcode or a codetextcode test to elements over on the browser during the initial fetch of elementspli lipOr else is there some way to do a batch codeisdisplayedcode call that asks about lots of elements instead of just onepli lipOr is a 0.1s roundtrip time from a Python test to Selenium under Firefox just completely unreasonable and it runs faster for everyone else and thats why obvious batch versions of these common operations do not existpli ul  pI had thought that I could just pivot to running codeexecutescriptcode from Python Java name codeexecuteScriptcode and from inside my JavaScript code somehow execute Seleniums logic that lies behind the complicated idea of is this element visible.  Unfortunately codeexecuteScriptcode does not seem to give scripts access to any of the util functions that Selenium itself finds essential, so to get access to an isvisible function we would have to pull either jQuery or a random Selenium code fragment into pages that otherwise lack them, interfering with the whole concept of a test that it tests the page asis without changing its JS profile merely in order to run our test.p  pThanks for any ideas I am rather surprised that Selenium expects callers to codeexecuteScriptcode to be rebuilding capability like codeisdisplayedcode that, as a glance at the code suggests, is a major feature of Selenium that looks like it took a lot of work to get correct and that one would want to access from all the code that possibly could, to avoid reinventing such an important wheel.p
Negative 761 pHas there been any work on supporting vectorstyle recycling for general data in Haskell For example runningp  precodemain  do   let ls  [1..1000000]   print ls codepre  pwith codepcode states that it allocates a total of 425mb. Runningp  precodemain  do   let ls  [1..1000000]   print ls   print ls  [1] codepre  pwith codepcode states that it allocates twice that, at 820mb.p  pI understand why this is happening, but Im wondering why GHC does not perform this optimization. I suppose one reason is that it doesnt show up much in real code so the benefits are slight, if anything but maybe a general way to recycle any inductive structure could give some benefit. Usually people are told to use other data structures anyways e.g. Data.Seq.p  pps  Ive seen links to the Recycle Your Arrays paper by Roman Leshchinskiy, however all links on the web are now dead and I dont want to pay to read it via Springerp  peditp  pWhen I use a hrefhttpshackage.haskell.orgpackagedeepseq relnofollowdeepseqa instead of print, I get similar but less extreme results. Without the append I get 80mb and with the append is 136mb. Not as extreme but its still a bit of memory that, in theory, could be saved.p

A Sample MIF File will have the following shapep  precodeDEPTH  32                    The size of data in bits WIDTH  8                     The size of memory in words ADDRESSRADIX  HEX           The radix for address values DATARADIX  BIN              The radix for data values CONTENT                        start of address  data pairs BEGIN  00  00000000                 memory address  data 01  00000001 02  00000010 03  00000011 04  00000100 05  00000101 06  00000110 07  00000111 08  00001000 09  00001001 0A  00001010 0B  00001011 0C  00001100  END codepre  pI havent found any software that will enable me to transform my own images into the format above. However, Ive found a C code that does it. Since I am not acquainted with C, I was wondering if anyone could help me understand the code, the library imports etc... so that I can transform it into JAVA. It would also be great if someone explains to me how to extract the MIF format from a photo and I could write my own code from scratch. The C Code is below.

Negative 761 pI have a view View1 that is initially laid out on the right side of the screen with a tableview to its left, both pinned to the outer edges of a content view.  I am trying to support animating View 1 fullscreen while also overlaying another view on top of it to provide some controls like exiting fullscreen.p  pI am able to programmatically store off the constraints and frame of the content view associated with View1, add View1 to Windows view, and then add the overlay view on top of it without a problem.  I am also able to support exiting fullscreen, which removes the overlay view, adds View1 back to the original content view, and restores the stored off View1 frame and constraints to the content view.  That works great.  Trying to go fullscreen a second time, however, does not work.  View1 is not visible and the overlay view is only partially visible.p  pThese views all have the proper size anytime I can think to print them out, including viewDidLayoutSubviews.  Inspecting the views after everything is laid out, I see View1 has a zeroheight, and the overlay view is collapsed to only fit its child subviews. p  pI suspect autolayout at play and hoping Im just missing something on the exitfullscreen.

I then set constraints on the black and green boxs keeping there top and out side edges the same distance from the superview and there bottom edges the same distance from the red box. p  pThe aim is that the red box stays the same height and changes width with the device size and orientation, With the green and black changing height and width to fill half of the rest of the screen each and meet in the middle.p  pNow i have set constraints to keep the black and green the same distance from each other, and it worked as i wanted however i get warnings that the black and green boxes have ambiguous positions and widths.p  pThe only way i have come up with to get rid of the warnings is to place a label alpha set to 0 so it cant be seen that is constrained to the centre of the screen then set the black and green boxs contains based on the label. This works and is warning free but i am sure that this is not the best way around the issue.p  pSo the question is how do i do this with out errors and with out placing an unnecessary hidden label.p

Ive tried updating the tablevals list in the update function which didnt update the displayed table, Ive tried putting the plotting code into the update equation which works for a few timesteps before it slows to a crawl since its trying to draw 20 tables overtop each other, I tried using the plt.clf command and it wipes out the entire plot instead of just the table subplot. p  pIve also tried setting .setanimatedTrue after creating my table but that just results in a blank subplot, and I cant seem to find documentation on how to use this feature. p  pIn any case, my question is how should I code this if I want to update the subplot table each time step using FuncAnimation. Im not including a code snippet since I dont know how to approach this problem yet. p
Negative 761 pthis is my first time posting a question and I hope not to waste any of your time.  Thanks in advance for any help.p  pI am attempting to calculate the distance between every zipcode in the United States and a list of 495 buildings 384 unique.  I already have the latitudelongitude and an approximation for the distance.  My problem comes in the form of not being sure how to update the rows in the table individually.

Negative 761 pI have the situation where a service running in the background makes itself available for ASCIIbased commands via a socket SOCKDGRAM placed on the file system. I am able to successfully send commands to this interface but cannot receive any response generated by the background service. p  pAs I understand it, the reason I am not receiving the services response is because the underlying IPC is not technically between two emprocessesem, but is rather between to emaddressesem.

However, the problem is that I do not want to pollute the directory space with too many additional socket files. p  pThat is to say, I can make this work by simply doing something like p  precodestruct sockaddrun local int len  s  socketAFUNIX, SOCKDGRAM, 0 local.sunfamily  AFUNIX strcpylocal.sunpath, pathtosomedirmySocketFile len  strlenlocal.sunpath  sizeoflocal.sunfamily binds, struct sockaddr amplocal, len Send commands to control interface of background service codepre  pAnd all is well, because by embindeming to emmySocketFileem the service has an address to which is will respond.p  pIn short, is there a way to communicate to the service through its available socket interface emandem receive the response without binding the local endpoint such that it creates another emsocketemtype file on the file system i.e. some kind of a emnamelessem socket, of sorts p  pOf course, if anyone spots any misconceptions or misunderstandings in my logic please point them out.p

Negative 761 pSo something interesting is happening  unfortunately, I cannot post a url or something you guys can access, so maybe someone just has an idea of what the cause could be.  Id assume it would be something in development.  Either way...p  pI have a test that logs in to an application, which will then load up a dashboard and search for some data.  In Firefox, everything works fine.  However, IE11 is having an issue once it logs in.  So, Selenium works fine up until it loads the dashboard, where it will then find NOTHING.  Not even html.  It gives the basic element not found error.  Im assuming the developers have written something that prevents access, but the one I talked to wasnt sure.  p  pAny idea of what could be causing this so that I could go suggest something to the developers  Again, this doesnt happen in Firefox, which could also suggest somethings up with IE11 though Selenium works fine on other applications and up until the Dashboard screen on this one.  If you need more information, let me know  just be aware that I might not have much to give.p  pA couple things to notep  precode1.  it is https protocol, but so is the login page 2.  at the end of the url bar, it says there is a certificate error that will not go away  no matter what I do I have added the supposedly correct certificates. codepre  pWhat Im usingp  precodeSelenium 2.4.5 32 bit IEDriverServer Python 2.7.8 IE11 other IE versions are not supported, so I cannot compare Windows 7 codepre  pEDITp  pI talked with a developer, and the best thing he could think of was the fact that the dashboard heavily uses polyfills, and that maybe that is the reason that Selenium isnt finding anything.  With that being said, is there a way to find elements using Selenium when polyfills are involved  Or is Selenium just not going to work for it.p  pMOREp  pHere is some code that equivalent to what my test would do.

Negative 761 pI am working on HTML Emails and facing one issue, I have style tags defined in the  section.  Outlook displays this email message with the required styling but Gmail doesnt. This is because Gmails Preprocessor removes the styles contained in  section.  Seems Inline styling is the only option to work with Gmail but it is not affordable because I require css styles applied to  and  and I have about 9000 table rows, 67 columns. So bunch of extra text will get generated if I go for inline styling with might exceed the size limit of email clients. Is there a way to figure out how can we achieve both i.e. not exceeding the size as well as proper rendering of message in Gmail.p

Negative 761 pIm writing a WinJS app for Windows Phone 8.1 using AngularJS and angularwinjs adapter and have a FlipFiew control in it using the winflipview directive. p  pThe model behind the flipview lives in the controller as an array of objects in scope.items. The content of the array can get updated externally so, when that happens, I get notified with the new array and then I replace scope.items with the new array inside a apply so Angular processes it properly.p  pSometimes, the only change is in the content of the last item, so there are no changes to the length of the array neither to the rest of the items. Then, when the scope.items changes, I see the last item is removed with a fadeoutlike animation and a new item is created in its place, which is not a good experience if it happens the user is having that item in the screen.p  pIonic Framework has an option to control wherer or not removing an item from a list triggers the fadeout animation itemremoveanimate but in WinJSangularwinjs it looks like the animation is on by default.p  pHow can I disable that animation on removeandinsert so the user just sees the content of the item changing instead of the item being removed and a new item created a second laterp
