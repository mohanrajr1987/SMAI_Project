Positive 20194 pI attempting to use the Cucumber Gherkin process of using Automation to handle some of my testing.  In evaluating any new system, I prefer to find similar competitors.p  pAre there any other systems like Cucumberp
Positive 20194 pBasically I want to check an error message when submitting a form with an empty required field.p  precodedef usertabfieldvalidation session.buttonclass, btnprimary.click session.text.include Giant Gerbils of the world unite end codepre  pThis step passes. I want to check for the text Please fill out this field but any text I look for will pass. Im fairly new to ruby and watirwebdriver so wondering where Ive gone wrong p  pThanks in advance.p
Positive 20194 pI have a step definition file that I want to use in my test project.  When my step definition file is placed inside an included project, all work fine.  But if instead of include the project, I include the jar that correspond to the include project, cucumber dont find step definition class.p  pthis is my annotation glue  p  precodeCucumberOptionsfeatures  scenariiconnexion, glue           cucumber.tests, org.includeProject.cucumber  codepre  pThe Step definition classes in cucumber.tests are finds by cucumber, but those in org.includeProject.cucumber are not.p  pAny Ideap
Positive 20194 pIm using Cucumber with Ruby and I want to execute some code after each step of the scenario. I have implemented the AfterStep hook, but I have found that it is not running after every step.p  precodeAfterStep do step   puts After step end codepre  pIs there any reason why Cucumber wouldnt run this hook after a particular step in the scenariop
Positive 20194 pIm experimenting with codeCucumberWebdriverIO UIcode tests using Webstorm NodeJs platform. At certain steps I would really love to stop it in strongdebugstrong mode, check the retrieved element and see what can I do with it.p  pBut unfortunately the strongDebugstrong button is disabled and I couldnt find anything specific in codeWebstormcode documentation as well.p  pIf I can achieve my original goal stopping a step and experimenting with the elements without using Webstorms strongDebugstrong mode, thats totally fine for me.p
Positive 20194 pI am new in using Geb and Cucumber for grails and I am following this tutorial a hrefhttpsgithub.comhaunergrailscucumberwikiTestingGrailswithCucumberandGeb relnofollowhttpsgithub.comhaunergrailscucumberwikiTestingGrailswithCucumberandGebap  pEverything has been fine up until I made a Page class and used it in my step definition.

Positive 20194 pRecently I try to move the model layer and dbmigration into rails engine, and I remove unnecessary things in engine, such as controller, view and dummyapp. It did work properly except running cucumber test. When I run the testin parent app it will drop the test database and rerun migration. Here is my env config in cucumber and engine.rb.p  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comwellsonjain790f40a6b299f09776ce relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comwellsonjain790f40a6b299f09776ceap  pI just made it like kind of namespace under my rails app, its really weird that it will drop the database. I think the root cause would be the appendmigration in engine.rb. When I put back the migration and remove the snippet code in engine.rb, it worked But the reason i use engine is encapsulate the model and db schema and mount to different rails app. if i cant append the migration, its meaningless. Thus, is there anyone encounter this kind of problem beforep
Positive 20194 pI have a page that has elements that become visible as you scroll down.  I am trying to execute a test to make sure the elements are not there until the scroll is to the bottom of the elements, but I cant seem to figure out how to pass the size from one call codeelementIdSizecode to the scroll offset of the next call codescrollcode.  Admittedly my brain does not yet get the concept of promises past simple call chaining.p  pI tried something like thisp  precodethis.browser     .setViewportSizewidth 1000, height 600     .elementselector     .thenfunctione           console.logthen element , e         element  e           .elementIdSizeelement.id     .thenfunctionsize          console.logSize , size          .callcallback codepre  pWhich I was hoping would use the passedin selector to get the element, set the element in the codethencode, then call codeelementIdSizecode on the elements ID, but the codevar elementcode is never set from the codeelementcode call, and the objects I am getting back dont seem to be what I am trying to get anyway.

Positive 20194 pIn my project, I have to current Maven modules setup p  precode Application   application code, using Spring Boot 1.2.6   E2Etesting has a dependency to Application  src      main          java              AbstractCucumberTest.java codepre  pBefore, this used to be a Spring 3 application serving JSP pages, so no Boot included. I refactored it to be a Boot application. p  pThe E2E testing setup basically built a WAR file of the application code, and the E2E module booted a Jetty server, running that WAR. All was well.  Now, after the refactor, not so much. p  pThe Jetty setup no longer works asis. When I boot the WAR, Im getting class loading exceptions, which are related to Jetty itself. Now, Im not hung up on Jetty, its just a testing container for me. So I started digging around in the Boot documentation, because I was convinced there had to be a way to make it all Bootiful, meaning I could simply boot the application when launching the tests. And there is, of course, so I ended up with these annotations on my AbstractCucumberTest p  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ContextConfigurationclasses  ApplicationConfig.class, loader  SpringApplicationContextLoader.class WebIntegrationTestspring.profiles.activelocal public abstract class AbstractCucumberTest extends SeleniumTest  codepre  pSo, basically, Im loading the application config of the application, and launching the Tomcat server from the test. And all rejoiced, because now the application was successfully booting upon launching a Cucumber test. The application boots, it reads the classpath, Liquibase boots, everything is working alright. I can call the Actuator endpoints, which all work fine. Even the REST endpoints of the application are all working, so Spring MVC is doing its thing. p  pHowever, 1 thing is not, and thats serving JSPs  and thats of course a deal breaker for E2E tests. Every time I surf to a page, I get the same unnerving 404 error. Before you ask yes, strongtomcatembedjasperstrong and strongjstlstrong are present. They are present in the application, I even added them to the E2E pom, no luck. In fact, these are the things I tried, but they all failed p  ul lipExcluding the tomcatembedjasper and jstl dependency from the applicationpli lipCopying over the JSPs from the application to the resources of the E2E modulepli lipSetting up my own CucumberConfig, which basically contained the same configuration as the ApplicationConfigpli ul  pIt just seems to me that the application cannot find the JSPs. Everything else is working just fine, just the JSPs are not foundserved. p  pDoes anyone have any thoughtsp  pOh, on a side note, I tried using the springbootmavenplugin, to try and boot the application that way. Problem is, though, that it cannot be forked. In the 1.2.6 release, the fork simply ... does not fork. When I say fork, I mean it in the Jetty way it boots the application, and gives control back to Maven. It instantiates a stop command, which Maven can call after all tests have run.  In the a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringbootdocscurrentSNAPSHOTmavenpluginexamplesitrandomport.html relnofollow1.3.0.BUILDSNAPSHOT versiona, it should be present using the start goal, but thats still not working for me. p  pstrong[EDIT]strong For what its worth, the Application module is configured to build a WAR file.

Positive 20194 pI am trying out cucumber for browser testing and am learning about BDD testing for the first time  so i am quite a beginner to BDD. I have encountered a problem and would like to know the bestpractice way of solving it.p  pemI am using it for a node.js webapp, so it is cucumber.js and selenium WebDriverJS, but the platform should not matter for this questionemp  pstrongDESCRIPTIONstrongp  pIn tutorials for the Gherkin syntax, you often see examples on clicking a button at a specific page, like for example p  precodeGiven something When I click the submit button Then something codepre  pImplementing the stepdefinition for this step is quite simple  just make selenium locate the element with whatever cssselector happens to match the button and then make selenium click on it.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pBut what if you have different buttons on different pages with the same human readable name i.e. the same name in the cucumber steptext, but which must be located by different cssselectorsp  pIt seems that you cant have stepdefinitions which are local to features, but that all stepdefinitions are shared among all features. This means that if you create a step I click the submit button, as above, the stepdefinition must work for testing all pages in the entire webapp which has a submit button. I am not really sure what is the proper way to do this.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pWhat is the best practice for handling thisp  hr  pstrongEXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEMstrongp  pLets say we have 3 pages which all have a next button, which does something completely different on each page and are located completely differently in the DOM. Lets say we have one feature for each of these pages. In each feature, the scenarios involving the next button looks like this p  precodeGiven I am on page xyz And ... And I click the next button And ... When ... Then ... codepre  pThe problem is that on the first page, the next button is perhaps located by .nextbutton, on the second page it could be someContainer .btn.btnprimary and on the third pageassetButtons linthchild3. If we had a stepdefinition local to each feature, they could simply look like p  precodethis.GivenI click the next button, functioncallback      this.driver.findElementthis.webdriver.By.css.nextbutton.click     callback   this.GivenI click the next button, functioncallback      this.driver.findElementthis.webdriver.By.csssomeContainer .btn.btnprimary.click     callback   this.GivenI click the next button, functioncallback      this.driver.findElementthis.webdriver.By.cssassetButtons linthchild3.click     callback  codepre  pBut since the stepdefinitions are global to all features, and you naturally cant create two stepdefinitions for the same regex, the stepdefinition for I click the next button need to know which page we are on or which next button the scenario is referring to.p  hr  pstrongSome of my own thoughtsstrong emoptional readingemp  ul liCould make the stepnames less generic and make them also refer to  which page the button is on I click the next button on the front page.  The problem with this is that we already wrote in the scenario that we are  on that page, so it is redundant.li liCould make up different names for the next button on the different pages  like front page next and search page next. li liCould make the stepdefinition detect which page you are currently on and use different cssselectors depending on the page. It could query selenium for the current URL, for example, and lookup which cssselector to use, based on both the buttonname from the step and the current page.li liCould include the cssselector in the steptext itself. But that is not quite human readable and doesnt seem like the BDD way.li liChoose a higher abstraction level, where you dont talk about buttons, etc, but the higher level action, such as I go to the next page in the search results. does not seem like a good approach in general  often the exact steps are important, since the same action can often be done in different ways, and all of those paths should of course be exercised by the test. For example, if you could also go to the next page by pressing N or swiping, this would only test 1 of these cases but could of course include that in the steptext too.li ul  pBut what is the RIGHT way to do itp

Negative 20194 pIm building a listinggrid control in a Flex application and using it in a .NET web application.  To make a really long story short I am getting XML from a webservice of serialized objects.  I have a page limit of how many things can be on a page.  Ive taken a data grid and made it page, sort across pages, and handle some basic filtering.  p  pIn regards to paging Im using a Dictionary keyed on the page and storing the XML for that page.  This way whenever a user comes back to a page that Ive saved into this dictionary I can grab the XML from local memory instead of hitting the webservice.  Basically, Im caching the data retrieved from each call to the webservice for a page of data.p  pThere are several things that can expire my cache.  Filtering and sorting are the main reason.  However, a user may edit a row of data in the grid by opening an editor.  The data they edit could cause the data displayed in the row to be stale.  I could easily go to the webservice and get the whole page of data, but since the page size is set at runtime I could be looking at a large amount of records to retrieve.p  pSo let me now get to the heart of the issue that I am experiencing.  In order to prevent getting the whole page of data back I make a call to the webservice asking for the completely updated record the editor handles saving its data.p  pSince Im using custom objects I need to serialize them on the server to XML this is handled already for other portions of our software.  All data is handled through XML in e4x.  The cache in the Dictionary is stored as an XMLList.p  pNow let me show you my code...p  precodevar idOfReplaceeString  this.WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.[0].[0].Id var xmlToReplaceXMLList  this.DataPages[this.Options.PageIndex].Data.Id  idOfReplacee  ifxmlToReplace.length gt 0      delete this.DataPages[this.Options.PageIndex].Data.Id  idOfReplacee[0]     this.DataPages[this.Options.PageIndex].Data  this.WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.[0].[0]  codepre  pBasically, I get the id of the node I want to replace.  Then I find it in the caches Data property XMLList.  I make sure it exists since the filter on the second line returns the XMLList.p  pThe problem I have is with the delete line.  I cannot make that line delete that node from the list.  The line following the delete line works.  Ive added the node to the list.p  pHow do I replace or delete that node meaning the node that I find from the filter statement out of the .Data property of the cachep  pHopefully the underscores for all of my variables do not stay escaped when this is posted otherwise this.amp95  this.p

I was looking at say transferTo in Java which sounds like it would be a decently optimized function to send files.

I need this to work on both Windows and Linux.  Also, other than transferTo, would there be some way to be more efficient, especially by taking advantage of the fact that many clients will usually need the same files  Im not sure how to do say multicast etc.  Also, Im using applicationlevel security rather than a VPN, and on the Java server, encrypting with AES and using MAC digital signing, so Im also looking for a crossplatform library recommendation to deal with the crypto on the C side with minimal pain.

Negative 20194 pApple says in the NSFetchedPropertyDescription class referencep  blockquote   pNote, however, that unlike a playlist   a fetched property is staticit does   not dynamically update itself as   objects in the destination entity   change.p blockquote  pNice, but what exactly does that mean static property Not dynamically updating in the destination entity changep  pCan someone explain thatp  pWhat I get in my head is that a fetched property is for weak references. Like A playlist may reference songs, but the playlist doesnt own them. If the playlist gets deleted, the songs never get deleted as a consequence of that. Also, the songs have no backreference to the playlist, they dont have to know that it even exists.p  pOk, so if a song gets deleted, the playlist isnt notified in any way Or what is Apple trying to tell mep

Negative 20194 pI am trying to replicate the functionality that users see when they go into edit mode for a contact for which they have already selected a photo, and then click that contacts photo.  An action sheet slides up, with options including Take Photo, Choose Photo, and Edit Photo.

Ideally, the person will be able to select this payroll date from the dropdown provided by the report parameter, which will then be used in the dataset to pull data from a table.  I would like the logic to be stored on the SQL server if possible, as this is something that will most likely be used on a few other reports.p  pThe logic to create the list of dates is rather simple.  It starts with the oldest payroll date that is need by the system sometime in 2007 and simply goes every two weeks from there.  The procedure or function should return a table that contains all these dates up to and including the nearest upcoming payroll date.p  pIt seems to me that the way to go about this would be a procedure or function that creates a temporary table, adds to it the list of dates, and then returns this table so that the report parameter can read it.  Is this an acceptable way to go about itp  pAny ideas, examples, or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 20194 pIm writing an app that is a power meter of sorts where I show a list of locations in the navigation that have a power rating associated with them, and a gauge that aggregates this information.

We must be able to find contacts of the lists base on the groups theyre in and the values of user defined values. We must provise up to 30 user defined fields. I see now three ways of solving this problemp  ol lipUsing kind of EAV we try to do it like this but it looks rather   complex. We have a table lists  lists of tenants, a related tables customfields, a related tables   subscribers that stored   emailaddreses of   subscribers of the  list, table subscriberscustomdata   which is related with subscribers and customfields tables stored values of the custom fields of the subscribers.pli lipField tables pattern. The descriptions of it is here a hrefhttpblog.springsource.comarjenarchives20080124storingcustomfieldsinthedatabasehttpblog.springsource.comarjenarchives20080124storingcustomfieldsinthedatabasea. In thise case wed use a field related to custom fields, that would store in columns all custom fields for example have 30 columns to store values of each possible custom fields and a table that stored mapping of columns name and name of the user defined field. It looks complex too. Wed have to have at least 30 indexes at least to search by the values of custom fields, there other problems too,pli lipTo use some sort of NoSQL database at least for storing of user defined fields and maybe groups of the list.  Do you think such databases can help here and if so how to design for storing custom fields and groups. I try to look at different types NoSQL, for example, document oriented like MongoDb, but right away I cant see how it can help solve this problem. We can store arbitrary attributes here but to search for the values of the custom fields we need to index them in advance so we have to know what custom fields well have.pli ol  pThank you for any information about it.p
Negative 20194 pguys  Im developing an iOS application which like any other requires a certain amount of free memory to run correctly. In my case  at least 4MB, I cannot use any less than that. Its a fairly small amount, but a few times on my device at least I got only 2MB free and the program crashed. What do you think is the best way to tell users how much memory you need. I know the code to get the currently available memory, but even if I tell the user like in a UIAlertView when the user starts the program that he is running low, what can I suggest him to do to free more memory except turning off and on the device. Any ideas Thank you p

Negative 20194 pI am new to programming. I am trying to learn Python using CH Swaroops Byte of Python. One example is to create a program which will backup some files from one directory to another and compress them into a .zip format.

Negative 20194 pI am seeing a problem with reusing my httpclient after an HttpPosts execute fails.  It can be a timeout or service not available maybe others.  The request might throw a sockettimeout and when i later use the client with a new HttpPost object it will throw an illegal state exception.  My research indicates that this occurs when the socket is not marked for reuse as in the case that naturally occurs if you have two threads and one is in the middle of processing its request before the second thread tries to use the httpclient hence its socket.p  pI think there is a bug in the httpclient code, but there could be either some best practises that I am not following correctly or some known work around.p  pAny help on this would be appreciated.p

I would like to replace that with a standard view that keeps in line with being the root of the navigation tree.  p  pI have the view I want laid out in the header of the table view, so I could technically turn off scrolling and just make the header fill the screen, but obviously Id rather do it right. p  pEvery way I have tried so far as seemed to break the application. Any suggestionsp

Ive been working in games for many many years and I dont like any game engine Ive worked on. This one is meant to be simple to use and easy to extend.

The System object initializes Windows and the platform specific renderer. In this case its openGL.

For example to add a new trade I would call codeDBUtil.InsertTradeltparamsgtcode, to add an order codeDBUtil.InsertOrderltparamsgtcode, to update a trade, codeDBUtil.UpdateTradeltparamsgtcode, etc. I was wondering if it would be better to create a Trade class, an Order class, a Broker class, etc. Would that improve the elegance, quality and maintainability of the program It seems like adding a lot more code for no benefit, well, I cant see the benefits right now of taking such an approach.p  pAs far as I can see adding a codeTradecode class would simply create an extra layer of code, because I would have to call codeDBUtil.InsertTradecode from the Trade class anyway when adding a trade, for example.p

Negative 20194 pConsider the functionprocess,p  pcodevoid taskfunvoid  while1  code If this process were to run on a normal PC OS, it would happily run forever. But on a mobile phone, it would surely crash the entire phone in a matter of minutes as the HW watchdog expires and resets the system. On a PC, this process, after it expires its stipulated time slice would be scheduled out and a new runnable process would be scheduled to run. p  pMy doubt is why cant we apply the same strategy on an RTOS What is the performance limitation involved if such a scheduling policy is implemeted on an RTOSp  pOne more doubt is that I checked the codeschedulecode function of both my PC OS  Ubuntu  and my phone which also runs Linux Kernel.

Negative 20194 pThe exact question is  why Convert is used instead of ConvertBack, and why really ConvertBack is needed here in the first placep  h2Problemh2  pBelow is EXAMPLE of my problem, I tried to simplify things. This is plain WPF, no 3rd party libraries, the problem itself is classic masterdetail with a little twist.p  pI have listbox list of cities and datagrid which lists all my friends  telephones. When I select listbox, datagrid should refresh and show the guys from the selected city. The datagrid looks like thisp  precodeName  Phone  PhoneType Mark  76447  cellphone ... codepre  pThe key issue here is PhoneType column. Each cell should be a combobox filled with predefined phone types fetched from database. And the twist lies with the db structure. It is something like thisp  precodetypeID  PhoneType  PhoneDescription 1       cellphone  NULL 2       neighbour  call only in case of emergency codepre  pIn my datagrid combobox PhoneType should be displayed strongBUTstrong if PhoneDescription is present, it should be used instead of plain PhoneType.p  pEnd of the problem. You with mep  h2Implementationh2  pIn order to have combobox in datagrid I have to use template column with combobox inside, instead of combobox datagrid column here is why a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4120027wpfdatagridcomboboxdatabindingWPF Datagrid ComboBox DataBindinga. So here it is my comboboxp  precodeltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding PathPhoneTypesList,            RelativeSourceRelativeSource AncestorTypexType Window   codepre  pOk, here above I define what should be listed in Combobox dropdown list.

This way WPF knows which record of phone types should be used as current value.p  pIf you are not 100 familiar with this binding, here is nice explanation a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4902039differencebetweenselecteditemselectedvalueandselectedvaluepathDifference between SelectedItem, SelectedValue and SelectedValuePatha p  pemBtw. typeID is used twice because in general I prefer using exactly the same name for related fields foreign key fields in database.emp  pI have the list, I have the matching done, now  for displaying I cannot use just a DisplayMemberPath because I need something more dynamic. p  precode  ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt     ltDataTemplategt       ltTextBlock TextBinding ConverterStaticResource PhoneTypeConvertergt     ltDataTemplategt   ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt ltComboBoxgt codepre  pSo to display PhoneType, I get entire record and choose appropriate string.p  precode[ValueConversiontypeofPhoneTypeRecord, typeofstring] public class PhoneTypeConverter  IValueConverter      public object Convertobject value, Type targetType,         object parameter, CultureInfo culture              if value  null             return null          var record  PhoneTypeRecordvalue  crash         return record.PhoneDescription  record.PhoneType            we dont do any conversion back     public object ConvertBackobject value, Type targetType,         object parameter, CultureInfo culture                  return null       codepre  h2Errorh2  pI compile entire application, I run it, I click on any city.

Negative 20194 pIm using C WinForms and GDI to do something I hoped wouldnt be too much problem but...p  pIm basically trying to draw a string within a rectangle that has highlighted sections within the string. This all works fine when printing on one line, but I have issues when trying to wrap the text onto the next line within the rectangle.p  pThe algorithm used is as follows p  pSplit strings into a collection of highlight and not highlight.p  precodeDo    If Highlightedtext Then      DrawStringHighLightedText     Move X position forward to next character space    Else      DrawStringNormalText     Move X position forward to next character space    End If  Loop codepre  pI would put the code in, but its messy and long im maintaining it. Itll print out find if the text is one string of either highlighting or not, as itll wrap it within the bounds of the rectangle without issue if its too long. If its multiple highlighting and the string is bigger than the rectangle, itll write outside of it... this is because the move X position forward... just moves the rectangle on which is a problemp  pI want to essentially move the point the text is printed within the original rectangle and print it on the next line if wrapping is required.

Each old application will become a subfunction of the new one the new one is fundamentally a wrapper.p  pObviously, each of these applications which have been developed by different people in different times work in different way, with different protocols, with radically different syntax for the messages i.e. some protocols use binary messages, some other use HTTP like messages, some other use XML and different message order strategies pipelining, stop and wait, etc....p  pFortunately, they are all TCP.p  pThe wrapper application should work opening something like 67 different sockets at different ports, and this is not good for our network administrators. They only want one socket on one port. So all the protocols have to crush on the same pipe.p  pIs there any pure Java, outofthebox solution to strongmultiplex and demultiplex many independent fullduplex streams on the very same TCP socketstrong, in a transparent and hasslefree mannerp  pOr is there a simpler solution Im forgetting aboutp  pEDIT the substreams are independent, i.e. theres no deadlock possibility caused by one substream waiting for some stuff coming from another.p

I have researched codesetChildIndexcode, but I dont think I am using it correctly.p  pAnother issue Im having is when the user clicks the clickbtn named for testing only to build the deck it takes a while to build it, can that be sped up anyp  pThen once the user clicks the first card to drag it there is another long waitp  pDocument Class CardGame.asp  precodepackage library  import flash.display. import flash.events. import flash.net.  public class CardGame extends Sprite              variables          private var xmlXML     private var loaderURLLoader     private var cardArrayArray     private var activityActivity             constructor          public function CardGamevoid              loader  new URLLoader                      loader.addEventListeneEvent.COMPLETE,buildArray                      loader.loadnew URLRequestlibrarycard.xml         clickbtn.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK,buildDeck                  metohods          public function buildArrayeEventArray              cardArray  new Array           xml  new XMLloader.data         forvar i0iltxml.card.lengthi                      ifxml.card.face[i]activity                              cardArray.pushidxml.card.id[i],facexml.card.face[i],categoryxml.card.category[i],pointxml.card.point[i],valuexml.card.value[i]                          else ifxml.card.face[i]event                              cardArray.pushidxml.card.id[i],facexml.card.face[i],categoryxml.card.category[i],pointxml.card.point[i],valuexml.card.value[i]                          else                              traceno card found                               return cardArray          public function buildDeckeEventvoid              forvar i0iltcardArray.lengthi                      ifcardArray[i].face  activity                              activity  new Activity                 activity.x  200                 activity.y  150                 activity.id  i                 activity.name  bi                 activity.buttonMode  true                 stage.addChildactivity                 activity.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN,dragStart                 activity.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP,dragStop                                public function dragStarteEventvoid              activity.parent.setChildIndexactivity, numChildren  1         activity.startDrag          public function dragStopeEventvoid              this.stopDrag        codepre  pcard.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingiso88591gt ltcardgamegt     ltcardgt              ltidgt1ltidgt                ltfacegtactivityltfacegt        ltcatagorygtTaskltcatagorygt             ltpointgt2ltpointgt                  ltvaluegtChange the rule.ltvaluegt     ltcardgt     ltcardgt              ltidgt21ltidgt                ltfacegteventltfacegt        ltcatagorygtInjuryltcatagorygt             ltpointgt2ltpointgt                  ltvaluegtInjury due to animalsnakeinsect bitecount 3.ltvaluegt     ltcardgt ltcardgamegt codepre  pThe xml file actually has 64 activity card entries and 41 event card entries, but I trimmed it down to make it easier.p

Negative 20194 pI have a UIImage view that I want to flip to being flat like a flip clock does. This is the first part to the horizontal plane where I will change the image or add a new view or something. My problem is getting the view to flip on the bottom axis. its 100px square. How can I get it to rotate by the bottom axis. I have read many many stack problems and answers, googled it and what ever answers I have dont work.

Negative 20194 pI am creating a website of floating width. The users use screens from full HD resolution to some 600px on smart phones it seems a pretty good idea. This brings up a very interesting problem.p  pWhen user uses a smaller resolution than is an optimum the page gets a lot more height. This means it might be useful to change order of some elements for example some image, search box or navigation to make the page more readable without much need of scrooling. p  pSo I need to be able to access DOM and change order of some page elements swap them.p  pLets say I have an list and need to swap item 1 and 2.p  precodeltulgt   ltligt1ltligt   ltligt2ltligt ltulgt codepre  pI found a solution based on appending already items elements to codeltulgtcode by using function codeappendChildcode.

Negative 20194 pI recently started looking into CakePHP  which Im so far loving. However, I need to ask a fairly simply questionp  pIts about model association. I got 2 models User and Group. A User can have multiple Groups and a Group can only have one User. So Ive made it like thisp  precodeltphp class Group extends AppModel      var name  Group     var belongsTo  User   gt  ltphp class User extends AppModel      var name  User     var hasMany  Group   gt codepre  pAnd then on the addgroup page I want it to be possible to select the user from a dropdown. My Group add view is as followsp  precodelth1gtAdd Grouplth1gt ltphp echo thisgtFormgtcreateGroup echo thisgtFormgtinputuserid echo thisgtFormgtinputname echo thisgtFormgtinputpincode echo thisgtFormgtinputprivate echo thisgtFormgtendCreate group gt codepre  pThe userid automatically transforms to a dropdown  however without any options. What do I need to do I assume I need to put somewhere that it should get the name from the User table.p

Negative 20194 pAs a selfdevelopment exercise, I want to develop a simple classification algorithm that, given a particular cell of a Dilbert cartoon, is able to identify which characters are present in the cartoon Dilbert, PHB, Ratbert etc.. p  pI assume the best way to do this is to 1 apply some algorithm to the image, which converts it into a set of features, and 2 use a training set and one of many possible machine learning algorithms to correlate the presenceabsence of certain features with a particular character being present in the cell.p  pSo my questions are  a is this the correct approach, b since theres a number of classification algorithms and ML algorithms to test, what is a good methodology for finding the right one, and c which algorithms would you start with, given that were essentially conducting a classification exercise on a cartoon.p
Negative 20194 pIm getting codeActiveRecordConnectionTimeoutErrorcode in a daemon that runs independently from the rails app. Im using Passenger with Apache and MySQL as the database.p  pPassengers default pool size is 6 at least thats what the documentation tells me, so it shouldnt use more than 6 connections.p  pIve set codeActiveRecordcodes pool size to 10, even though I thought that my daemon should only need one connection. My daemon is one process with multiple threads that calls codeActiveRecordcode here and there to save stuff to the database that it shares with the rails app.p  pWhat I need to figure out is whether the threads simply cant share one connection or if they just keep asking for new connections without releasing their old connections. I know I could just increase the pool size and postpone the problem, but the daemon can have hundreds of threads and sooner or later the pool will run out of connections.p  pThe first thing I would like to know is that Passenger is indeed just using 6 connections and that the problem lies with the daemon. How do I test thatp  pSecond I would like to figure out if every thread need their own connection or if they just need to be told to reuse the connection they already have. If they do need their own connections, maybe they just need to be told to not hold on to them when theyre not using them The threads are after all sleeping most of the time.p

Negative 20194 pMy model consists of a single main object that the user can add various other objects too. The added objects are stored in codeListltobjectgtcode contained within the main object and its associated child objects.p  pSo if the project is a house. The user can add a number of codeRoomcode objects to the house which are stored in codeListltRoomgt RoomListcode. Then each codeRoomcode can have a number of codeFurnishingscode added again stored in each Room codeListltFurnishinggt FurnishingsListcodep  pThe question is how to implement this in the MVVM approach When the user adds a new object do i add it to the codeObservableCollectioncode in the ViewModel so the view is updated and at the same time add it to the model which is hooked into the VM Or do i store it in the VM until a save or commit commmand and then pass it to the Modelp  pIn my example i have various editors each is a user control. So the user can edit the house at a high level, using one editor to add, edit and remove rooms from the house. And, at a lower level, using a different editor to edit each room, adding and removing codeFurnishingscode.p  pSo when the user Edits a room say. I produce an codeEditRoomModelViewcode containing said codeRoomcode. The user adds, edits and otherwise manipulates the furnishings in that room.p  pAt each command is it best to sync the data in the Model and the ModelViee as above. Or do i shove the changes straight into the Model and have the ViewModel provide only getters on the injected Model properties. This way however adding objects to the Model Lists does not update the view. i would really have to add the data to both the ModelView and the Model at the same time so everything is at the same state.p  pAppologies for rambling, struggling to find a nice approach to this, anyone uderstand what im getting atp

So I am calling a file through ajax which returns the new rep number for that user.

Negative 20194 pSo I am trying to redirect all image requests from my server to use a custom PHP script.  The PHP script is built into a framework which can be accessed through a hrefhttpwww.domain.comimagesimageNameHere.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.domain.comimagesimageNameHere.jpga  The user obviously doesnt know that the image is being served to them.  So now the problem is that this method is currently working for the top level of it, but for the backend its causing a lot of issues.

Found this out by using header detection tools online and then seeing in the errorlog that every image loaded comes up with a 404 not found error  Needless to say I cant have this, and I need all the requests to be 200s.

Negative 20194 pall I thank you for your time and attention today  . I currently use Dreamweaver and do some design work, however I have been unable to find an answer to this question. Im happy to pursue any knowledge necessary to accomplish this such as learning php or javascript, etc.... Heres is my problem... I want to make a webpage have this type of layout  this would be a homepage, broken into components in three columns there would be a header above, that I left out of the illustration because that would be full width of website and not produce a problem, I dont think... the left is full height. the center would have three rows and the right would have three rows  offset from the center column p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comKkEiR.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comKkEiR.jpgap  pI can place a div as a wrapper around the entire thing as I normally need to do when making a three column wide section, and using css... float the left column, left. Add a left margin to the center one whatever the width of the left div is. And float the right one, right... However, while that does allow me to have three columns across, I cannot have the multiple rows downward in the center, or right column because it outputs at the height of the largest column for the wrap. In these smaller sections I would like to use some php scripts I have a php news script and a shoutbox script, so its not like its a static picture or text that I could carefully slice, making numerous div wraps and divs within them down the page... p  pIn my research Ive seen things such as php includes and requires Im not sure if that would allow for the multiple rows in the center and right colums though, I just know it can be used to insert a php script or document into a div. Ive also read that isnt the best practice and that Ajaxjquery should be considered for better security. However, Im still not sure if either of those would allow me to create this layout. Im sure that joomla or drupal or any number of other CMS probably allow for this, but I want to know the hands on way to do it Ive always found that makes configuration, troubleshooting and design much easier and much better quality down the line.p  pI respectfully ask that answers stay on topic as much as possible, without questions such as, why do you normally do or use this etc... I would greatly appreciate constructive information on what I CAN do to accomplish this  D... I thank you all again for your time and attention p

Negative 20194 pI implemented multitouching buttons in my app, by definyng and attaching my version of OnTouchListener and onTouch method to all my buttons. All works perfectly, except for one thing which seems to belong to standard behaviour of the listener. I hope to be able to explain it without posting code since its long.p  pIf I click and hold a button, the onTouch method is called, as expected, and application sees button clicked. If I click and hold a second one, the onTouch method related to first button is called, as expected, and application sees button clicked.p  pIf I release only second one, if my finger on the first button stays ABSOLUTELY motionless, the onTouch event is not called and the second button is not logically released. The onTouch method gets called only if I move at least a pixel first finger, and only in that moment the second button gets released.p  pI know that its very difficult to keep a finger exactly in the same position for more than one millisecond ,  but sometimes it happens..I had to spend some time in order to understand the reason for this behaviour, and I didnt find a solution, have you got any suggests to workaround this problem Thank you very much.p

However if I directly call the method from codeviewDidLoadcode, the database gets updated but the view doesnt show up. On the other hand if i implement the creation of the spinner inside codefetchQueuecode, it works vice versa. Allright from codeviewDidLoadcode but not from the buttontarget action.p  pIm probably doing it all wrong using a block that I dont really need. Actually I dont want the user to be able to touch anything during the update of the DB. But I found this snipped and, since it worked on the test I kept it.p  pAny suggestions on how to do it in a more proper wayp  pThanksp

Negative 20194 pIm reading up on protocols and thinking I might be able to rewrite some code using them but I seem to be getting stuck on what exactly makes it different than a classp  pFor example, if I have a class ColorControllerp  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt  interface ColorController  NSObject    UIColor colorToReturn      UIColor  setColor  float red  float green  float blue   end codepre  pand the .mp  precodeimport ColorController.h  implementation ColorController     UIColor  setColor  float red  float green  float blue    float newRed  red255 float newGreen  green255 float newBlue  blue255  colorToReturn  [UIColor colorWithRednewRed greennewGreen bluenewBlue alpha1.0]  return colorToReturn  end codepre  pand then import it into another class p  precodeColorController colorManager  [ColorController new]   UIColor newColor  [colorManager setColor66.066.066.0] codepre  pthis seems to make perfect sense to convert into a protocol, since a lot of other classes could use the setColor method. But I am not sure if my understanding of protocols is off, I thought that once a protocol was declared it would be available to other classes, but since you have to still include it in the .h files, the only discernible difference to me was that with a protocol the setColor method could be called directly in whatever class I have imported the protocol to, whereas with importing a class I would have to call back to the class and method [colorManager setColor66.066.066.0] What exactly would be the gain here p  pNow my view is probably because Im a newbieinexperienced with protocols and have a limited view on them and their usage so if someone could give me a brief other than go read the docs  D  reply on the benefits of protocols and maybe an example of use Id really appreciate it. p

Negative 20194 pFirst Ill explain what exactly I want to do here. I have a dialog box in which I am showing a frame. Using menu from this dialog, I open another Dialog box which shows me macrogrid block information from the first dialog. So to show 2nd dialog box I am using function  DialogBoxhInst, MAKEINTRESOURCEIDDDIALOG1, NULL, DialogProc But this transfers the execution of the program to the new dialog box and I cant process further messages in the 1st dialog unless I close the new dialog box. p  pCan someone please tell me a way to solve this problem Is it the same thing as modal vs modeless dialogboxesp  pSomeone suggested me to use BackgroundWorker thread for this purpose. But when I tried to research about it, I read at many places that it doesnt work with win32 programming. Instead in some forums I read about using PostMessage function for the same purpose. Can someone help me deciding what would be the best approach to handle this problem I would really be grateful if someone could explain it in detail. p  pThanks a lot.p

I unset the codedatacode variable after sending the data to the header then recreated it when I wanted to send some data to the main view  but still the problem is not fixed.  p  pstrongI made a simple example for this bugunexpected behaviorstrong  p  pConsider this view, named codetestcode  p  precodeltphp  echo somedata   codepre  pAnd this controllerp  precodeclass Test extends CIController       function index       data[somedata]  Some data.     thisgtloadgtviewtest, data             Output       Some data.           unsetdata     unsetdata[somedata]Just to make sure its not PHPs fault.     thisgtloadgtviewtest            Output       Some data.              Even though the data variable is unsetted AND not passed            differentdata  array      thisgtloadgtviewtest, differentdata                 Output       Some Data.              Still outputs the same thing, even though       Im sending different arrayand the data array is unstted.                        codepre  pstrongNote The whole code will output codeSome data.code three times.strongp  pThe only way to solve this issue is sending a different array and setting the array keywhich is codesomedatacode to something else which will override the old one. p  pSo, is this a bug or something made by CodeIgniters dudesp

Negative 20194 pI have a Silverlight application that is designed for a certain minimum resolution with layout growing gracefully if more space is available. What I want to do now is easily add some crude support for lower resolutions. p  pTo do that, I introduced ScrollViewer as the layout root  the idea was to show appropriate scrollbars when screen is lower then the fixed minimum so the user can scroll the main layout. The problem is, now the whole layout grows without any bounds and scrollbars appear regardless of screen size.p  pOne solution is to set the contents fixed size equal to the minimum supported size. This, however, kills the graceful growing if screen is larger. Or, I imagine, I could programmatically set the maximum size to what I determine is screen resolution.p  pIs there any way to do this elegantly in XAMLp

Negative 20194 pIs there a way to change the codePLONESITEIDcode from its default at codeplone.app.testing.interfacescode without modifying the source codep  pIm using Plone 4 with several custom products, and codeplone.app.testingcode 4.0.2 with relative success. In my custom products, there are several instances where there are hardcoded physical paths to locate objects when performing catalog searches e.g., my site root is mySiteID, so several custom queries use codepathmySiteIDfolder1etc..code to do catalog searches.p  pThe problem is that the site root in the Plone instance that codeplone.app.testingcode configures codePLONEFIXTUREcode is codePLONESITEID  plonecode.

Negative 20194 pConsider following example. Lets say we have an app in which professional writers write stories from a web based UI. And then these stories become available for user of the iOS app as in app purchase items.p  pAs you may know we need to create in app purchase products in advance. But in our situations it means that for each of the story created by the writers we will have to create a new IAP product and wait for Apple to approve it.p  pTo circumvent this, I am planning to create generic consumable products in IAP like story worth 1.99, story worth 2.99, so on, so forth. Then in the Application UI I will show the list of stories of created by the writers and show corresponding prices for the stories as specified by the authors when they created the story. Once the user taps on the buy button, I will show the purchase for the generic consumable product of the same price and complete the in app purchase process. p  pNow the question is will Apple approve of such implementation Does it fit with their IAP policy I am asking as I couldnt find a guideline for a workflow such as this. p  pAnother approach to implement this is by implementing an in app creditcurrency system, like games use. Where people buy creditscoins and then they purchase items with coins. This is a tried and tested approach but it doesnt fit in my analogy of the app, hence the question.p

Since it is a long task, I use codetmuxcode to keep my coderails consolecode alive when my codesshcode connection is disconnected.p  pI know that using codetmuxcode is actually emulating me using the coderails consolecode. So my question is, is there a real difference between running a codedelayedjobcode and doing the task in coderails consolecodep  pDoes running long task in coderails consolecode eat up more resources on the machine, compared to a codedelayedjobcode, because it is running at foregroundp  pIs running coderails consolecode on codetmuxcode become a background service Since I can leave it running on its own.p  pThanks.p

Negative 20194 pstrongUpdate 2strong G. Grothendieck posted two approaches. The second one is changing the function environment inside a function. This solves my problem of too many coding replicates. I am not sure if this is a good method to pass through the CRAN check when making my scripts into a package. I will update again when I have some conclusions.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI am trying to pass a lot of input argument variables to codef2code and do not want to index every variable inside the function as codeenvc, envd, envcallscode, that is why I tried to use codewithcode in codef5code and codef6codea modified codef2code. However, codeassigncode does not work with codewithcode inside the codecode, moving codeassigncode outside codewithcode will do the job but in my real case I have a few codeassigncodes inside the codewithcode expressions which I do not know how to move them out of the codewithcode function easily.p  pHere is an examplep  precode In the ltenvironment RGlobalEnvgt a lt 1 b lt 2 f1 lt function     c lt 3 d lt 4 f2 lt functionP     assigncalls, calls1, inheritsTRUE     printcalls     returnPcd   calls lt 0 v lt vector fori in 110     v[i] lt f2P0     c lt c1     d lt d1     returnv  f1 codepre  pFunction codef2code is inside codef1code, when codef2code is called, it looks for variables codecalls,c,dcode in the environment codeenvironmentf1code. This is what I wanted.p  pHowever, when I want to use codef2code also in the other functions, I will define this function in the Global environment instead, call it codef4code.p  precodef4 lt functionP   assigncalls, calls1, inheritsTRUE   printcalls   returnPcd  codepre  pThis wont work, because it will look for codecalls,c,dcode in the Global environment instead of inside a function where the function is called. For examplep  precodef3 lt function   c lt 3   d lt 4   calls lt 0   v lt vector   fori in 110     v[i] lt f4P0  or replace here with f5P0     c lt c1     d lt d1      returnv  f3 codepre  pThe safe way should be define codecalls,c,dcode in the input arguments of codef4code and then pass these parameters into codef4code. However, in my case, there are too many variables to be passed into this function codef4code and it would be better that I can pass it as an environment and tell codef4code do not look in the Global environmentcodeenvironmentf4code, only look inside the codeenvironmentcode when codef3code is called. p  pThe way I solve it now is to use the environment as a list and use the codewithcode function. p  precodef5 lt functionP,liste   withliste,      assigncalls, calls1, inheritsTRUE      printcalls      returnPcd           f3 lt function   c lt 3   d lt 4   calls lt 0   v lt vector   fori in 110     v[i] lt f5P0,as.listenvironment  or replace here with f5P0     c lt c1     d lt d1      returnv  f3 codepre  pHowever, now codeassigncalls, calls1, inheritsTRUEcode does not work as it should be since codeassigncode does not modify the original object. The variable codecallscode is connected to an optimization function where the objective function is codef5code. That is the reason I use codeassigncode instead of passing codecallscode as an input arguments. Using codeattachcode is also not clear to me. Here is my way to correct the codeassigncode issuep  precodef7 lt functionP,calls,liste   calls ltlt calls1   browser   assigncalls, calls1, inheritsTRUE,envir  sys.frame1   printcalls   withliste,     printpastewith the listed envrionment, calls,calls     returnPcd          f8 lt function   c lt 3   d lt 4   calls lt 0   v lt vector   fori in 110     browser     v[i] lt f4P0  or replace here with f5P0     v[i] lt f7P0,calls,listeas.listenvironment     c lt c1     d lt d1      f7P0,calls,listeas.listenvironment   printpastefinal call number,calls   returnv  f8 codepre  pI am not sure how this should be done in R.

Negative 20194 pI initiated a multidimensional arrayp  precodeprivate byte[,] grid  new byte[9, 9] codepre  pI want to hold a byte List with some values, for each cell withing the existing grid. p  pI know a 3 dimensional array would be handy here. But since the list with invalid values is dynamical, I would like to use a List instead of an array.p  pstrongEditstrong To give some context here. Im making a sudoku, which is represented by a multidimensional array. Since I would like to solve the sudoku programmatically and Im using the backtrack algorithm, I need to remember the digits that where invalid for each cell.p  pSo each cell should consist of a value and a List. I could probably just put the actual field as first value in the list. But never know if there is an actual clean solution p
Negative 20194 pI have an array of JSON objects being returned from a server that looks something like the followingp  p[State Finished, JobID 1234, Owner John, State Finished, JobID 5678, Owner Joe, State Active, JobID 8765, Owner Jane, State Active, JobID 4321, Owner Jill]p  pI would like to put this in a hierarchy Kendo UI grid NOT groupable but rather as shown at a hrefhttpdemos.kendoui.comwebgridhierarchy.html relnofollowhttpdemos.kendoui.comwebgridhierarchy.htmla with the master record being State Finished, Active and the detail records being the rest of the JSON object each State is associated with. Since there are no masterdetail relationships like the typical CustomerIDOrderID, etc., per se, I dont think the grids detailInit function can work here unless I create my own pseudo masterdetail relationship for this purpose, but please correct me if Im wrong. In any event, let me know if what Im is even possible without jumping through too many hoops to get to the end to get there. Having a small working example here or in JSFiddle would be phenomenal too.  Thanks.p

Its just the authenticating bit.p  pIs there a chance the crm has blocked this log in somehow it still works for logging into the crm itself, just not with this soap log in p  pIs there a way of white listing a usernamep  pHere is the xml i am sending to get the security tokensp  precodeltsEnvelope xmlnsshttpwww.w3.org200305soapenvelope                 xmlnsahttpwww.w3.org200508addressing                 xmlnsuhttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsswssecurityutility1.0.xsdgt                   ltsHeadergt                     ltaAction smustUnderstand1gt                     httpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502trustRSTIssueltaActiongt                     ltaMessageIDgt                     urnuuid88dea52e97a3422282cd3c4cde5e3e2fltaMessageIDgt                     ltaReplyTogt                       ltaAddressgt                       httpwww.w3.org200508addressinganonymousltaAddressgt                     ltaReplyTogt                     ltVsDebuggerCausalityData xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comvstudiodiagnosticsservicemodelsinkgt                     uIDPozBEzPwJdOhoN2XNauvYcAAAAAK0Y6fOjvMEqbgs9ivCmFPaZlxcAnCJ1GiXRpi09nSYACQAAltVsDebuggerCausalityDatagt                     ltaTo smustUnderstand1gt                     httpslogin.live.comextSTS.srfltaTogt                     ltoSecurity smustUnderstand1                     xmlnsohttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsswssecuritysecext1.0.xsdgt                       ltuTimestamp uId0gt                         ltuCreatedgt20130419T124125.256ZltuCreatedgt                         ltuExpiresgt20130419T124625.256ZltuExpiresgt                       ltuTimestampgt                       ltoUsernameToken uIdusergt                         ltoUsernamegtUSERNAME REMOVED FOR POSTltoUsernamegt                         ltoPassword Typehttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wssusernametokenprofile1.0PasswordTextgt                         PASSWORD REMOVED FOR POSTltoPasswordgt                       ltoUsernameTokengt                       ltwsseBinarySecurityToken ValueTypeurnliveiddevice                       xmlnswssehttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsswssecuritysecext1.0.xsdgt                         ltEncryptedData IdBinaryDAToken0                         Typehttpwww.w3.org200104xmlencElement                         xmlnshttpwww.w3.org200104xmlencgt                           ltEncryptionMethod Algorithmhttpwww.w3.org200104xmlenctripledescbcgt                           ltEncryptionMethodgt                           ltdsKeyInfo xmlnsdshttpwww.w3.org200009xmldsiggt                             ltdsKeyNamegthttpPassport.NETSTSltdsKeyNamegt                           ltdsKeyInfogt                           ltCipherDatagt                             ltCipherValuegt                                 LONG CYPHER VALUE REMOVED FOR POST                             ltCipherValuegt                           ltCipherDatagt                         ltEncryptedDatagt                       ltwsseBinarySecurityTokengt                     ltoSecuritygt                   ltsHeadergt                   ltsBodygt                     lttRequestSecurityToken xmlnsthttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502trustgt                       ltwspAppliesTo xmlnswsphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200409policygt                         ltaEndpointReferencegt                           ltaAddressgturncrmemeadynamics.comltaAddressgt                         ltaEndpointReferencegt                       ltwspAppliesTogt                       ltwspPolicyReference URIMBIFEDSSL                       xmlnswsphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200409policy gt                       lttRequestTypegt                       httpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502trustIssuelttRequestTypegt                     lttRequestSecurityTokengt                   ltsBodygt                 ltsEnvelopegt codepre  pThis is the response i getp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt ltSEnvelope xmlnsShttpwww.w3.org200305soapenvelope xmlnswssehttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsswssecuritysecext1.0.xsd xmlnswsuhttpdocs.oasisopen.orgwss200401oasis200401wsswssecurityutility1.0.xsd xmlnswsthttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgws200502trust xmlnspsfhttpschemas.microsoft.comPassportSoapServicesSOAPFaultgt ltSBodygt ltSFaultgt ltSCodegt ltSValuegt SSenderltSValuegt ltSSubcodegt ltSValuegt wstFailedAuthenticationltSValuegt ltSSubcodegt ltSCodegt ltSReasongt ltSText xmllangenUSgt Authentication FailureltSTextgt ltSReasongt ltSDetailgt ltpsferrorgt ltpsfvaluegt 0x80048823ltpsfvaluegt ltpsfinternalerrorgt ltpsfcodegt 0x80041010ltpsfcodegt ltpsftextgt The credential is blocked.ampx000Dampx000Altpsftextgt ltpsfinternalerrorgt ltpsferrorgt ltSDetailgt ltSFaultgt ltSBodygt ltSEnvelopegt codepre

Negative 20194 pIm attempting to learn python and I thought trying to develop my own prime sieve would be an interesting problem for the afternoon. When required thus far, I would just import a version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes that I found online  its this that I used as my benchmark. p  pAfter trying several different optimizations, I thought I had written a pretty decent sieve p  precodedef sieve3n top  n1 sieved  dict.fromkeysxrange3,top,2, True for si in sieved     if si  si gt top         break     if sieved[si]         for j in xrangesi2  si, top, si2       []             sieved[j]  False return [2]  [pr for pr in sieved if sieved[pr]] codepre  pUsing the first 1,000,000 integers as my range, this code would generate the correct number of primes and was only about 35x slower than my benchmark. I was about to give up and pat myself on the back when I tried it on a larger range, but it no longer workedp  precoden  1,000  Benchmark  168 in 0.00010 seconds n  1,000  Sieve3  168 in 0.00022 seconds  n  4,194,304  Benchmark  295,947 in 0.288 seconds n  4,194,304  Sieve3  295,947 in 1.443 seconds  n  4,194,305  Benchmark  295,947 in 3.154 seconds n  4,194,305  Sieve3  2,097,153 in 0.8465 seconds codepre  pI think the problem comes from the line with code[]code, but I cant figure out why its so broken. Its supposed to mark each odd multiple of j as False and it works most of the time, but for anything above 4,194,304 the sieve is broken. To be fair, it breaks on random other numbers too, like 10,000 for instance. p  pI made a change and it significantly slowed my code down, but it would actually work for all values. This version includes all numbers not just odds but is otherwise identical. p  precodedef sieve2n top  n1 sieved  dict.fromkeysxrange2,top, True for si in sieved     if si  si gt top         break     if sieved[si]         for j in xrangesi2, top, si             sieved[j]  False return [pr for pr in sieved if sieved[pr]] codepre  pCan anyone help me figure out why my original function sieve3 doesnt work consistentlyp  pEdit I forgot to mention, that when Sieve3 breaks, sieve3n returns n2. p
Negative 20194 pI currently use SMF as my forum software but im currently building a my own customized forum software and i would need to import the entries from my SMF database into my new database. I noticed that Mysql uses a sha1  way of encoding passwords which i also incorporated into my own database table password field. I came across a website where i was able to decode the hash code from my table but when i tried to do that of the SMF table, it wasnt  working. Im thinking that its not entirely a sha1 and that its probably mixed with someone. That could be why its not converting. I kinda think it has something to do with the password salt stuff which im still trying to wrap my head  around. p  pPls, is anyone familiar with the password field in the SMF Mysql membership table I just hope its possible to import my membership list into my new table cos if i cant, i may have wasted my time building a new application.p

Negative 20194 pI have few doubts on how producer consumer recipe will work with Zookeeper.p  pAll the examples I have seen so far have producers and consumers in the same java processes as separate thread. But the whole point of being distributed is to have different instances  multiple  of producer and consumer. p  phaving different instances of producers and consumer means no local locks  syntonization  will be of any use. p  pAlso because multiple processes are watching the same root queue node, they all will start processing a particular incoming entry.p  pWhat I am getting wrong here p

Negative 20194 pIm using Visual Studio 2012 and I wrote some Razor scripts in .cshtml.  Im not using MVC but asp.net web page 2 the term which is what Microsoft called it.  It is created as website package not project package or webapplication.p  pWhen I compile it and run the website, I ran into a razor syntax error on the website.  Upon closer inspection I noticed Visual Studio see the syntax error w red underline but it is allowed to compile anyway.p  pSo, is there a flag or something I need to turn on in Visual Studio to enforce the razor errors.  Yes, I know it takes longer to compile but we do need it cuz we cant see everything at runtime and we missed some of the errors when it was deployed to production site.p  pThanks.p

Negative 20194 pWhile Im reading the book ASP.NET MVC 4 Im wondering about MVVM.

Negative 20194 pI am testing a website which is still in development. p  pOften an elements id, class, text, or position in the DOM will change. And then the locator Ive been using will no longer be able to find the element.p  pBut the features are still functioning properly. I dont want several tests to fail when there is no actual regression.p  pSo instead of having a single locator for each element, I have a collection of locators.p  precodepublic static final ArrayListltBygt LOGINANCHORLOCATORS  new ArrayListltBygt  static       LOGINANCHORLOCATORS.addBy.idloginLink      LOGINANCHORLOCATORS.addBy.linkTextLogin      LOGINANCHORLOCATORS.addBy.xpathhtmlbodydiv[5]a           codepre  pMy method for finding the element looks like thisp  precodepublic WebElement locateElementArrayListltBygt locators       create an element to return     WebElement element  null       until the desired element is found...     while element  null           loop through the locators         for By locator  locators               try to find by locator             element  customWait.untilExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocatedlocator               if not found...             if element  null                   log the failure                 logFailingLocatorlocator                                return element  codepre  pIt tries to find the element with the first locator in the collection, and only if it fails, try the next locator.p  pThe collection is an codeArrayListcode order is defined by insertion order, which means my codefor loopcode will try each locator in the order which they were added to the List. p  pI initialized the list above by adding the locators in a particular order. Id is first, because I figure if the elements position in the DOM changes, but it retains its id, then that will be the way Ill be most likely to locate the correct element. Xpath is last because even if the idclasstext changes, but there is still the same type of element in the DOM at that position, its probably the right element, but maybe less certain than other locators would be.p  pIm using a fluent wait which ignores NoSuchElementExceptionp  precode Wait 5 seconds for an element to be present on the page, checking  for its presence once every quarter of a second. WaitltWebDrivergt customWait  new FluentWaitltWebDrivergtdriver         .withTimeout5L, TimeUnit.SECONDS         .pollingEvery250L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS         .ignoringNoSuchElementException.class codepre  pSo when one locator fails, it wont break the loop  it just logs the failure and then  still goes on to try the next locator.p  pIf all the locators fail, then the element will remain null, the test will fail, and its far more likely the reason is actual regression of featuresfunctionality.p  pI periodically check my logs for any element with 1 or 2 failing locators, and update them in my pageObject in the meantime, while tests continue running smoothly. p  pWhat are pros or cons to setting up my project this wayp

Negative 20194 pstrongTo make sure I am as clear as possible, I have a master page that contains a content place holder.  Inside of content place holder I have a table.  I want the table to be large enough to allow all of the content in the columns to be on one row, but I dont want it to be any larger than that.  Once the table is the appropriate size, I want the containerpage to shrink onto the table so there is no random white space.  Anyone have any ideas on how this is suppose to be done properlystrongp  pWhat I have triedp  pI have a master page with a content place holder.  I set up the div that contains the content place holder with p  precodestyledisplayinlineblock codepre  pThis shrinks the container to the size of the whatever is inside of the content place holder.  This worked perfectly fine until I wanted to reformat my table that was inside of the content place holder.  I didnt like how the shrink was forcing the elements in my table to wrap to a new line any time there was white space.  So I addedp  precodestylewhitespacenowrap codepre  pto my individual columns and this gave me the desired effect of having all my columns occupy one linerow, and the container was shrinking well onto my table until I finished the lastp  precodestylewhitespacenowrap  codepre  pon my last column.  What I realized is that the container wasnt changing size based on if I was usingp  precodestylewhitespacenowrap codepre  por not.  The container had already shrunk a fixed amount and every time I made a column wider by preventing the wrapping, the table would come closer and closer to boardering the edge of my page.  Then when I unwrapped my last column the table went over the page.  I addedp  precodestyleoverflowauto codepre  pand that allowed me to see my entire table but I dont want to have to scroll, and there is plenty of room for the page to stretch in the window to accomodate my table without scrolling.

Negative 20194 pHave landed into a scenario. I have a gridview with 22 static columns few are BoundFields, few are TemplateFields. We have a scenario in our project that we need to order the GridView according to the columns selected. The order of the columns selected is provided from the UI. For ex We have Doc1 to Doc23 as the columns. Now, from the functionality provided in the UI, I am passing some 4 columns say Doc2,Doc4,Doc5,Doc7. Now I want that only these 4 columns should be present in my grid as a final output. Have tried some code, but it doesnt seem to work. Below is my codep  precode    public int GridColumnOrderingstring columnList              string[] test  columnList.Split         var docCatColumn  gridResultSet.Columns[0]         var docTypeColumn  gridResultSet.Columns[1]         int columnCount  0         int testCount  0          for int i  0 i lt test.Count i                      if test[i]  Doc2                              gridResultSet.Columns.Inserti , docCatColumn                 columnCount                          if test[i]  Doc3                              gridResultSet.Columns.Inserti , docTypeColumn                 columnCount                               gridResultSet.Columns[2].Visible  false         gridResultSet.Columns[3].Visible  false      codepre  pcolumnList is a parameter passed which has values such as Doc2Doc3. My idea is that I get the static columns which resemble the column gotten from the UI, change its position to the very next position, and then hide that static column. In this way, we actually have 2 columns by the same name, but I am trying to hide the static one and display the dynamic one. I know it sounds weird and hectic, but this is what came to my mind. Now the problem is that if I try to change the visibility of the static column, the visibility of the dynamic one also changes. Can experts help on this issue or point out to some easy method in this regards Regards Anuragp

I have tried to pass the data back to the calling class from onPostExecute and my app is unable to display the outages. I stepped through the app and found that my data is being returned to me after I set the adapter for timetable data. p  pIs there a way to accomplish this task simultaneously or I have to wait for one task to finish before starting another.p

Negative 20194 pIn the last few days Ive been trying to learn how to use ASP.NET Web Forms together with multithreading the hard way by building a simple applet using both and Ive been struggling with aspects of interactions between different threads and the UI.p  pIve resolved some multithreading issues in some other questions and also learned after waaaaaay too long that web forms and WPF are not the same thing but now Im running into trouble finding the best way to update UI elements based on data acquired in multiple threads.p  pHeres my codep  pstrongDefault.aspxstrongp  precodepublic partial class Default  System.Web.UI.Page      private NlSearch search     private static int counter  0     private static SortedListltlong, SearchResultgt resultsList  new SortedListltlong, SearchResultgt      protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              search  new NlSearch           protected void AddSearchMethodobject sender, EventArgs e              var text  SearchForm.Text         new Task gt MakeRequesttext           protected void UpdateMethodobject sender, EventArgs e              resultsLabel.Text           foreach var v in resultsList.Values                      resultsLabel.Text  v.SearchTerm     v.Count   occurancesltbrgt                    protected void ClearSearchMethodobject sender, EventArgs e              resultsLabel.Text           resultsList.Clear           protected void MakeRequeststring text              counter         SearchResult s  new SearchResult                      SearchTerm  text,             Count  search.MakeRequeststext                  resultsList.Addcounter, s       codepre  pIve tried quite a few versions of the same basic thing. NlSearch.MakeRequest called by MakeRequests sends an HTTP POST request to an outside web site imitating a search bar input, and then extracts an integer from the markup indicating how many results came back.p  pThe current simple UI revolves around a SearchForm textfield, an Add Search button, an Update Label button a Clear Search method, and a ResultsLabel that displays results. The AddSearch button creates a new task that calls MakeRequest, which calls the method to send the HTTP request and then stores the results in the order they were sent in a static sorted list.p  pSo now ideally in a good UI I would like to just update the label every time a thread returns, however Ive tried using ContinueWhenAll and a few other task functions and the problem seems to be that other threads do not have the ability to change the UI. p  pI have also tried running a new thread on page load that updates the label every few seconds, but this likewise failed. p  pBecause I havent been able to implement this correctly, Ive had to use the Update Label button which literally just tells the label to display whats currently in the static list. I would really like to get rid of this button but I cant figuer out how to get my threads to make UI changes.p

Negative 20194 pWhen comparing codedoublecode values in C, using the codelt,gt,,code operators, we cannot always be sure about correctness of the result. Thats why we use other techniques to compare codedoublescode, for example, we can compare two doubles a and b by testing if their difference is really close to zero. My question is, does the C standard library implements codestdlessltdoublegtcode and codestdgreaterltdoublegtcode using these techniques, or it just uses the unsafe comparison operatorsp

Negative 20194 pIm developing an application that gets mail addresses from a database and then send an email to those addresses. In my script first I get the recipients, then save the messages into disk and after a while using CRON I send them. The number of messages in the spool directory matches the number of recipients.

I checked the database to see if some addresses were duplicated but thats not the case, and the script that sends the spooled messages doesnt have a loop, so Im pretty lost here.

Negative 20194 pI am trying to improve my CSS skills and am having some trouble. I want align 3 DIVs on the same row, starting at the top of the container div. I was able to get them aligned horizontally, but they are not displaying at the top. It seems they are all aligning with the bottom which I cant figure out. Can anybody point me in the right direction as to how to make the divs have no margin and float to the top p  pI tried declaring the margins but didnt have much luck. Also, this is going to be in a partial view through MVC so setting the container to absolute may not be an option because its height from the top of the page will be changing. p  pHere is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3Xygz relnofollowJFIDDLEa and I have also attached my code, both HTML and CSS, along with what is being rendered in my browser. p  pThanksp  pHTMLp  precodeltfieldsetgt ltlegendgtItemsltlegendgt  ltdiv classoutercontainer idtopgt     ltdiv classcontaineragt       ltdiv classgrouptitlegt         ltinput typecheckbox runatserver gt       ltdivgt         ltdiv classleft itemgtLeft Contentltdivgt         ltdiv classcenter itemgtCenter Contentltdivgt         ltdiv classright itemgtRight Contentltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classoutercontainer idbottomgt   ltdiv classcontaineragt       ltdiv classgrouptitlegt         ltinput typecheckbox runatserver gt       ltdivgt       ltdiv classleft itemgtLeft Contentltdivgt       ltdiv classcenter itemgtCenter Contentltdivgt       ltdiv classright itemgtRight Contentltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt ltfieldsetgt codepre  pCSSp  precodetop      border 3px solid green  bottom      border 3px solid blue  .item      positionrelative     display inlineblock     display inline     zoom 1     margin0     top0     width 32     color white  .left      backgroundred  .right      backgroundblue  .center      backgroundgreen      .containera      textalign center     whitespace nowrap      .grouptitle      textaligncenter     fontweightbold     fontsizelarger  .grouptitle2  textaligncenter width100  codepre  pBelow is what is being renderedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd51hI.jpg altWhat is actually being diaplayedp
Negative 20194 pSo I dont have resharper I think the command was like ctrlshiftt.  When I want to search files I use ctrl comma.  The search box pops up and then I start typing.  But the built in preview just grabs whatever I have typed and opens the file.  Even though I am still typing.  So I am trying to open a file reportvaccine, but I only get out report and the preview has opened the first selected report.  It has pretty much rendered this form of quick file searching useless.  Which is a huge bummer because we have hundreds of procs and scrolling through and manually finding the file is a huge pain.  If there is a way to turn off preview I would be fine with that.  This command working properly is waaay more important to me than a preview of the file to be opened.  Thanks I would greatly appreciate the help.p

Negative 20194 pIm trying my make an invitation system together with the Facebook PHP APK. What I basically want is when you have invited your friends, Facebook redirects back to your website with an array containing userIDs from friends that the user invited. I wish to loop through them and insert the invitations into a database. The looping and all is already under control but the database query isnt.p  pThis is what my current query looks likep  precodeSELECT iID FROM invitations WHERE iSender  SENDER AND iReceiver  RECEIVER codepre  pIf that returns zero rows I process this queryp  precodeINSERT INTO invitations iSender, iReceiver VALUES SENDER, RECEIVER codepre  pAnd then I check if theyre already signed up to my websitep  precodeSELECT uID FROM users WHERE uOAuthID  RECEIVER codepre  pIf it returns more then 1 row I run the following and final queryp  precodeUPDATE invitations SET iProcessed  1 WHERE iReceiver  RECEIVER codepre  pSo basically this is how the process is currently shapedp  ol liIf the user hasnt already has been invited by the inviter we insert the invitation into the database.li liThen we check if the invited user already is signed up.li liIf he is signed up we update the invitation and say that it already has been processed.li ol  pstrongI guess theres a better and faster method to do this with just maybe 1 or 2 queries.

Negative 20194 pIve written a DSL and a compiler that generates a .NET expression tree from it.  All expressions within the tree are sideeffectfree and the expression is guaranteed to be a nonstatement expression no locals, loops, blocks etc..  strongEditstrong The tree may include literals,  property accesses, standard operators and function calls  which may be doing fancy things like memoization inside, but are externally sideeffect free.p  pNow I would like to perform the Common subexpression elimination optimization on it.p  pFor example, given a tree corresponding to the C lambdap  precodefoo gt      foo.Bar  5  foo.Baz  2 gt 7            foo.Bar  5  foo.Baz  2 lt 3             foo.Bar  5  3  foo.Xyz codepre  p...I would like to generate the treeequivalent of ignore the fact that some of the shortcircuiting semantics are being ignoredp  precodefoo gt       var local1  foo.Bar  5        Notice that this local depends on the first one.              var local2  local1  foo.Baz  2         Notice that no unnecessary locals have been generated.      return local2 gt 7  local2 lt 3  local1  3  foo.Xyz  codepre  pIm familiar with writing expressionvisitors, but the algorithm for this optimization isnt immediately obvious to me  I could of course find duplicates within a tree, but theres obviously some trick to analyzing the dependencies within and between subtrees to eliminate subexpressions efficiently and correctly. p  pI looked for algorithms on Google but they seem quite complicated  to implement quickly. Also, they seem very general and dont necessarily take the simplicity of the trees I have into account.p

I decided to use sqldf for efficiency and because I use it to read other data source already. Problem is sqldf truncates column 5 to 1.152922e18. This is more like a index that Id need to join with another DF. So I need the exact value. I dont think nrows argument will help here. I do need to read a value that seems higher than what base R can handle. I think INT64 package might help but that has been archived. Any suggestion on how I can read big int in sqldfp  pI used scan as a work around by specifying column 5 as a string. I get the full value now but it is inefficient when used in joinsmerge. If reading as string is the only way out, can I achieve this in sqldf what and colClasses are not supported by sqldf. How can I mention that column 5 should be treated as stringp

Negative 20194 pI have a simple application which has recently had its premise changed. It used to be that a user would tap on a text field and up would come a custom toolbar above the keyboard, allowing the user to select from the custom buttons to add to the text in the text field. So if a user typed in Johns and pressed the strongWeddingstrong button, the text field would add Wedding to the end so it would now say Johns Wedding. p  pI have recently changed the UI to incorporate a new Table view controller when the user selects the text field because I have some autocompleting occurring making it easier for the user. I have brought the keyboard forward but now, instead of the custom button adding to the text in the search bar, it is simply replacing it. p  pSo if you type John in the search bar and press strongWeddingstrong in the custom keyboard, the search bars text completely gets replaced from John to strongWeddingstrong. This is not ideal and I need to fix this. p  pHere is some codep  precodevoidconfigureKeyboardToolbars      UIToolbar eventToolBar  [[UIToolbar alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0.0f, 0.0f,                                                                           self.view.window.frame.size.width, 44.0f]     eventToolBar.tintColor  [UIColor colorWithRed0.6f green0.6f blue0.64f alpha1.0f]     eventToolBar.translucent  NO     eventToolBar.items    [ [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitleWedding                                                                styleUIBarButtonItemStyleBordered                                                               targetself                                                               actionselectorbarButtonAddText],       With the text field, the line below used to be     self.eventTextField.inputAccessoryView  eventToolBar      self.eventAddSearchBar.inputAccessoryView  eventToolBar codepre  pThis calls the method belowp  precode A method that responds to the tool bar buttons being pressed IBActionbarButtonAddTextUIBarButtonItemsender      if self.eventAddSearchBar.isFirstResponder              self.eventAddSearchBar.text  sender.title       codepre  pThis used to bep  precode A method that responds to the tool bar buttons being pressed IBActionbarButtonAddTextUIBarButtonItemsender      if self.eventTextField.isFirstResponder              [self.eventTextField insertTextsender.title]       codepre  pSo the searchBar does not have an insertText method and I can understand that it is simply replacing the text over it however I am not sure how I would go about adding the custom toolbar word to the END or beginning of the text in the search bar depending on what the user types. p  pIf the user presses the button before typing, it would be Wedding John and if the user presses it after more likely it should be Johns Wedding, or whatever the user types. p  pAny assistance would go a long way p

Negative 20194 pI am new to Coherance and I am going through the a hrefhttpwww.benstopford.com20090304oraclecoherencepartianintroduction relnofollowhttpwww.benstopford.com20090304oraclecoherencepartianintroductiona blog post and in his blog, the second reason he says coherance is fast because it keeps the data in serialized format. Please bear with me here on my understanding.pObjects are always held in their serialised form using an efficient binary encoding named POF  find out more about this here. Holding data in a serialised form allows Coherence to skip the serialisation step on the server meaning that data requests only have one serialisation hit, occurring when they are deserialised on the client after a response. Note that both keys and values are held in their serialised form and in fact the hash code has to be cached as a result of this.pWhen you want to use data in your application from cache, you will have to  read the serialized data and then deserialize the data to use it.

This second activity doesnt have any UI, it just initializes some variables and executes automatically a method that makes some processing. p  pFirst I start this method calling it from onCreate, but inside the method I use some functionalities that must implement some interfaces, so, I think that these methods are being executed before they have had time to initialize.p  pSo my question is about how to start automatically a method when I start a new activity, but giving to it some time before starting, to let the implemented interfaces initialize.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong p  precodepublic class GameActivity extends Activity implements TextToSpeech.OnInitListener       private static TextToSpeech tts      public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.game          tts  new TextToSpeechthis, this         ...

Negative 20194 pI have a codeSearchTextBoxcode custom control, pictured herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkHuKe.jpg altSearchTextBoxp  pWhen the mouse clicks on it, that label disappears. If the user clicks away and there is no text, the label reappears if the user clicks away but leaves text there, the text stays and the label stays hidden. This button replaces the image when the user starts typingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMMOw4.jpg altSearchTextBox2p  pWhen the user clicks the button, the text is cleared.p  pThats all working correctly. The odd behavior Im talking about is that when the clear button is clicked, the label flashes on the control for a splitsecond before disappearing it should remain hidden the entire time. Because the codeMultitriggercode in the XAML uses codeIsFocusedcode, I thought maybe I could fix the problem simply by calling codeFocuscode in the codebehind before the codeClickcode event finishes. This seems a little hacky, but it actually worked.

Negative 20194 pForgive me im new to recursion but as far as i understand this should work, but it doesnt. I made this method that calls itself recursively when successfully found a pathp  precodeprivate void RandStepPoint pos                     Collections.shuffleArrays.asListdirections, rand Incorrect, should have a local directions array. Nothing to do with the question though.         for int i  0 i lt directions.lengthi                      Check if the positions are within map bounds.             if pos.x  directions[i].x gt 0 ampamp pos.x  directions[i].x lt width ampamp pos.y  directions[i].y gt 0 ampamp pos.y  directions[i].y lt height                              Check if the position is unvisited.                 if mazeMap[pos.x  directions[i].x][pos.y  directions[i].y].visited                                      Break walls this tile.

If i understand recursion correctly it should exit this method and go to the previous run of codeRandStepcode and finish the direction loop. When it does not find any valid cells there it again should exit and finish the loop in the previous codeRandStepcode. This should be repeated until it finished the direction loop of the very first codeRandStepcode run.p  pLike i said, it stops at the moment it cannot find any valid cells. It does not continue the previous methods on the recursion stack.p

Negative 20194 pI tried to use the a hrefhttpwww.jwplayer.com relnofollowJWPlayera for play a video in my current project. And for secure our media file on server. I put secure key in the header of the video render action by using javascript. p  pFor example, if I want to request to a hrefhttpmydomain.comvideo5bmyvideoname5ddownload relnofollowhttpmydomain.comvideo[myvideoname]downloada, and I have to put the secure key like strongAuthorization Bearer f850dae6bb36ffa2f7c07c30fea158ca99e8c237strong into the header of the request to server. But I search somewhere on internet, but maybe could not find out any solution to set the request header. Could anyone let me know can I do like this or not  p
Negative 20194 pSimple question, but I cant seem to find an answer. If I am trying to display a battery voltage, for example, a difference of a few decimal points can be very important. If I have this   p  blockquote   pstringFromNumbervoltage  Vp blockquote  pand voltage is 12.4, it will output 12V. This is no good. I could quite easily fix this by editing the resultant stylekit, but I would have to do that every time I made a change, which would be a real pain. Does anyone have a solutionp  pI am working with the C output, but the problem exists with both C and ObjectiveC.p  pRelevant Code  p  pIn Paintcode I have a Voltage String expression of codestringFromNumbervoltage  Vcode  which generates p  blockquote   pprivate void DrawGuagefloat voltage br   ...br   var voltageString  new NSStringMath.Roundvoltage.ToString  Vp blockquote  pI want Paintcode to generate the same, but without the Math.roundp

Negative 20194 pIm using the following solution to prevent loss of focus of the codecontentcode textarea when the user has clicked on a code.boxcode elementp  precode Detect latest element clicked document.mousedownfunctione      lastElClicked  e.target    Prevent loss of focus for textarea when clicking on tools content.onblur, functionevent      if lastElClicked.attrclass  box         event.preventDefault         this.focus         return false       codepre  pIn a few words, on mouse down save the target element that has been clicked. On the blur of the codecontentcode textarea check if that last element clicked was a code.boxcode. If it was then prevent default, refocus the codecontentcode textarea and return false.p  pMy solution works perfect under Chrome but I still loose focus under Safari and Firefox. How can I make this work cross browserp  pEDITp  pThe problem with the solutions offered is that the element actually looses focus and is refocused after. In Chrome with the code above I never actually loose fucus, which means selected text stays selected. p

Negative 20194 pGood afternoon, we have a small problem with performance of generating excel.p  ul liFirst, we was creating excel cell by cell  it is ... lets say unacceptable.li liSecond, we started insert into excel with one command  range creating and it is much faster, but still not perfect so we are searching next solutions. li ul  pBecause we can load XML file from database, we tried used XSLT and from these two files create xls file. It is nice, but after open this file there is error message shown it is because of problem or bug in registry. User has to accept this message and after excel is opened. We want to eliminate this error message. However we dont know how. p  pWe was thinking about convert this xls file into xlsx but we are unable to do it becouse we cant install office on server we cannot use Interop and OpenXML libraries dont know work with normal xls file. So my question isp  ol liIs possible to generate from XML file with using of some XLST or something the strongxlsxstrong fileli liEventually can what files do we need to create and zip together if we want create xlsx file li ol  pThank you for informationp

Negative 20194 pI have the following queryp  precodeSELECT c.cardNo, acc.accountId FROM card c LEFT JOIN accounts acc ON c.accId  acc.id codepre  pThe above query returns 500 rows. In the above query I am retrieving all cards. I am pretending to see that cards which do not have an account just as an example, will return NULL instead of an accountId. p  pThen I wanted to get all cards, and only the accountId of countries registered in Europe.

Negative 20194 pPreviously, Ive written SOAP clients in Python and used the SUDS library.  Without getting into the details, the stub generation is really quite dynamic as its done at runtime and, with Python being so typeless, Im able to reference the expected methods generated by the WSDL without a precompiled stub.  Im fine with generating a stub with something like wsimport, because its great to have the composition of SOAP messages being handled via a nice Java object structure.  So, Im not looking for a dynamic generation mechanism akin to SUDS in python.p  pMy problem is that all the simple JAXWS examples I see are for what Ill call a statically located web service.  What Im trying to do is connect to a web service with a known WSDL from which I could generate stubs at compile time but whose location is only known at runtime.  For example, say I want to access Microsoft SharePoint Web Services.  Wherever my application is deployed, there will a different SharePoint server or servers running which will need to be specified at runtime.  All the simple examples Ive seen have the service location URL hardcoded into the stubs through wsimport.  Is there a way to generate stubs but supply the service location at runtimep  pIm really surprised not to find any examples of this because I figure what Im trying to do should be very common as Web Services go.  Perhaps the answer is that I cant be lazy and get a nice objectified version of the WSDL methods if the server location is only known at runtime.  Ive seen SAAJ examples but there, of course, I have to generate the SOAP messages by hand myself.  That would be such a shame when the WSDL is known at compile time.  Cant I have my cake and eat it toop

Negative 20194 pThere are some externally sourced Java classes that happen to be defined all in the default unnamed package, i.e. there are no codepackage ...code statement at the top of the code.javacode source files where these Java classes are defined.

I use IntelliJ IDEA 13.1 to work on this project and set the code.jarcode file containing the external Java classes as a library and project dependency.  However, I dont know how to configure Gradle so it properly handles the dependency. Currently, I just manually added a configuration for the project as a regular Java Application.  Clicking on Run using the configuration compiles and runs the project OK.p

Negative 20194 pIm tryin to use scikitlearn to cluster text documents. On the whole, I find my way around, but I have my problems with specific issues. Most of the examples I found illustrate clustering using scikitlearn with kmeans as clustering algorithm. Adopting these example with kmeans to my setting works in principle. However, kmeans is not suitable since I dont know the number of clusters. From what I read so far  please correct me here if needed  DBSCAN or MeanShift seem the be more appropriate in my case. The scikitlearn website provides examples for each cluster algorithm. The problem is now, that with both DBSCAN and MeanShift I get errors I cannot comprehend, let alone solve.p  pMy minimal code is as followsp  precodedocs  [] for item in [database]     docs.appenddoc  vectorizer  TfidfVectorizermindf1 X  vectorizer.fittransformdocs  db  DBSCANeps0.3, minsamples10.fitX ... codepre  pMy documents are already processed, i.e., stopwords have been removed and an Porter Stemmer has been applied.p  pWhen I run this code, I get the following error when instatiating DBSCAN and calling codefitcodep  precode...

Negative 20194 pI am working on a Windows Phone 8.1 application. I am about a month into the project and have seen little to no issues with what I have written so far. p  pI decided to do some testing on the application without running it through the VS 2013 debugger. Now, for some reason, the app crashes before it gets to the first screen. I get no exceptions or messages whatsoeverI am using Raygun for error logging.p  pI am using async methods throughoutsome async void, others async Task, but all of this works when debugging.p  pThe main thing that would help, is to get some sort of error message. Ive been reduced to commenting out sections of code, but ultimately this is getting me nowhere because it seems when I think Ive found the issue, I get another crash further down into the code.p  pAt one point, I found an issue with calling ListView.UpdateLayout. I commented this out and the app would run properly no crashes. I then uncommented some code further down and now its crashing again.p  pIf anyone knows of a way to get exceptions from the phone or if someone has experienced this issue before, any help would be greatly appreciated. I can provide any further information that is needed.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I think I have narrowed the issue down to Sqlite.NET. I am using Sqlite.Net for WinRT along with an extension called SqliteNetExtensions. The particular statement is p  precode    DataContext.Context.Connection.TableltMessagegt.Wherem gt m.ChannelID  channelID ampamp m.ChannelID.ContainsC.ToList codepre  pIf I comment this out, the app runs with no problems. This LINQ statement at most returns 100 records. I would not think that a 100 record SELECT statement could cause the app to crash, but it seems like the culprit. Any ideas on how to optimize Sqlite.NETp  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Finally figured it out It was not SQLite at all. It was not my code at all. It was my phone. I am running a Nokia Lumia Icon. I had installed Rudy Huyns Lockscreen Beta a few weeks back. It caused some issues when I uninstalled it but it wasnt related to my application. Today, I had my business partner install my app on his phone, he has the same model phone. The app was about 50x faster and did not crash. I restored my phone from factory and, lo and behold, it ran perfectly. So, pro tip DO NOT INSTALL LOCKSCREEN BETA BY RUDY HUYNp

Negative 20194 pSo, I have a Java application that uses Swing for building the GUI and implements the MVC design pattern, and because of that I am ending up with a lot of instances of codeSwingWorkercode being used in the view to make calls to the controller and a lot of calls to codeEventQueue.invokeLatercode from the controller to the view. This seemed like the way to go because of the singlethreaded nature of Swing and MVC best practices, but now I have code that duplicates the following pattern many, many timesp  precodepublic class MainController   private final View someView   public void someMethodObject data          Do stuff with the data maybe change the model.         EventQueue.invokeLater new Runnable              Override              public void run                   someView.updateViewObject someObject  This is the code that I actually need to execute                             public class View extends JPanel  or whatever    private final MainController controller    public class someListener implements ActionListener        public void actionPerformedActionEvent e             new SwingWorkerltVoid,Voidgt                public Void doInBackground                    controller.someMethodobject   This is the code I actually want to execute                    return null                            .execute              codepre  pI am aware that I can write a method that passes a runnable to a call to codeEventQueue.invokeLatercode, but I would still have to duplicate all the code for implementing a runnable. Most of the pieces of code that I actually need to run, do not have much in common besides the fact that they need to run on the EDT or in a SwingWorker, so extending codeSwingWorkercode or implementing codeRunnablecode is not going to help. My question is, how do I avoid all this duplication Is the problem with the design Or is there a way to make my method calls without all this overhead codep

But then I wouldnt know what to do in the other direction, for shrinking it when Show less is tapped.p  pIm open for suggestions, and will be doing some experimenting myself.p  p[Edit So, I was initially concerned that if I replaced the explicit numberOfLines setting and just introduced a height constraint, the text wouldnt properly truncate at the end ... if its too long, but it seems to do that just fine.p  pThat said, it would be handy to be able to set the number of lines instead of the height, because I want it to seem consistent across multiple devices, even after I implement automated fontresizing based on the screen dimensions, for tablets and such.p  pThat can be a consideration for later though. Ive got a height constraint on the label, and Im hoping that if I remove the constraint and wrap it in some animation code, it will adjust to its full size. However, I still cant quite get the code right.]p

Negative 20194 pI have a problem where I have to read in some 3 dimensional coordinates and translate those to 2 dimensional and draw the resulting points. I dont have a problem doing that, but I also have to constrain the drawing area and window to the resulting set of points.p  pIn one example, the minimum X value is 0.12 and the maximum is 0.78. The minimum Y value is 0.109 and the maximum is 0.571. Basically I want these coordinates to define the view size  that is, I want these coordinates to be translated to pixels and take up the whole window. xPercent and yPercent are supposed to be an additional 5 margin around the whole thing. All these values are calculated correctly, I think Im just using GL.Ortho incorrectly or possibly not even using the correct thing. Ive attached an image of what is currently showing up. There are many more points that are going out of the window and the highest point needs to be closer to the top of the window.p  pYes, this is homework, but the teacher is instructing in C and Id like to do the assignments in C. This is the only part I need help with and Ive been searching for hours.p  pThis code is in my OnRenderFrame method.p  precodeGL.MatrixModeMatrixMode.Projection GL.LoadIdentity GL.OrthoxMin  xPercent, xMax  xPercent, yMin  yPercent, yMax  yPercent, 1.0, 1.0 codepre  pImage a hrefhttpi.imgur.coml6kdKsZ.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.coml6kdKsZ.pngap

Each record is composed of several bit fields that basically hold info on codeeventscode where an event is eitherp  ol liThe detection of a photonli liThe arrival of a synchronizing signalli ol  pEach Int32 record can be treated like following Cstyle structp  precodestruct      unsigned TimeTag    16     unsigned Channel    12     unsigned Route      2     unsigned Valid      1     unsigned Reserved   1   TTTRrecord codepre  ol liWhether we are dealing with a photon record or a sync event, time tag will always hold the time of the event relative to the start of the experiment macrotime.li liIf a record is a photon, valid  1.  If a record is a sync signal or something else, valid  0.li liIf a record is a sync signal, codesync type  channel amp 7code will give either a value indicating start of frame or end of scan line in a frame.li ol  pThe last relevant bit of info is that Timetag is 16 bit and thus obviously limited. If the Timetag counter rolls over, the rollover counter is incremented. This rollover overflow count can easily be obtained from channel codeoverflow  Channel amp 2048code.p  pstrongMy Goalstrongp  pThese records come in from a high speed scanning microscope and I would like to use these records to reconstruct images from the recorded photon data, preferably at 60 FPS.p  pTo do so, I obviously have all the infop  pI can look over all available data, find all overflows, which allows me to reconstruct the sequential macro time for each record photon or sync.p  pI also know when the frame started and when each line composing the frame ended and thus also how many lines there are.p  pTherefore, to reconstruct  a bitmap of size noOfLines  noOfLines I can process the bulk array of records line by line where each time I basically make a histogram of the photon events with edges at the time boundary of each pixel in the line.p  pPut another way, if I know Tstart and Tend of a line, and I know the number of pixels I want to spread my photons over, I can walk through all records of the line and check if the macro time of my photons falls within the time boundary of the current pixel. If so, I add one to the value of that pixel.p  pThis approach works, current code in the repo gives me the image I expect but it is too slow several tens of ms to calculate a frame.p  pstrongWhat I tried alreadystrongp  pThe magic happens in the function codeint[] Renderlinecode see repo.p  precodepublic static int[] RenderlineVint[] someRecords, int pixelduration, int pixelCount               Will hold the pixels obviously         int[] linePixels  new int[pixelCount]           Calculate everything sync, overflow, ... from the raw records         int[] timeTag  someRecords.Selectx gt Convert.ToInt32x amp 65535.ToArray         int[] channel  someRecords.Selectx gt Convert.ToInt32x gtgt 16 amp 4095.ToArray         int[] valid  someRecords.Selectx gt Convert.ToInt32x gtgt 30 amp 1.ToArray         int[] overflow  channel.Selectx gt x amp 2048 gtgt 11.ToArray         int[] absTime  new int[overflow.Length]         absTime[0]  0          Buffer.BlockCopyoverflow, 0, absTime, 4, overflow.Length  1  4          absTime  absTime.Cumsum0, prev, next gt prev  65536  next.ZiptimeTag, o, tt gt o  tt.ToArray          long lineStartTime  absTime[0]          int tempIdx  0          for int j  0 j lt linePixels.Length j                      int count  0              for int i  tempIdx i lt someRecords.Length i                              if valid[i]  1 ampamp lineStartTime  j  1  pixelduration gt absTime[i]                                      count                                             Avoid checking records in the raw data that were already binned to a pixel.             linePixels[j]  count             tempIdx  count                   return linePixels      codepre  pTreating photon records in my data set as an array of structs and addressing members of my struct in an iteration was a bad idea.

Negative 20194 pI have a python script which initiates multiple instances of a class foo and then executes the method run of the class using multiprocessing.pool.map like thisp  precodeimport multiprocessing.dummy as mp import fooclass  def runinstanceinstance     return instance.run  for arguments in listofarguments     instances.appendfooclass.Fooarguments  mp.pool.mapruninstance, instances codepre  pwhich works very well.

The problem now is, that with the way described above, I get one logfile per instance, but the logmessages from all the instances go in every logfile. If I name the logger, like thisp  precodeself.logger  getLoggername  logger codepre  pthen the logmessages will be assigned to the files correctly, but all logmessages from imported modules, in which I initialized module loggers like thisp  precodemodulelogger  logging.getLoggername codepre  pwill no longer be displayed in the logfiles, since the module logger does not recognize the differently named loggers in the class instances as parent loggers which works perfectly with the above approach.p  pIs there any way to obtain perinstance logfiles with logmessages from imported modules also being written to these filesp

Negative 20194 pIll start by saying that Im not a Java developer and also Im not a Docker expert.p  pIn order to minimize the gap between frontend and backend in this specific case, Java developers I started to put some docker images in place with java and maven and after the build I start a docker container with a volume pointing to the java project and frontend developers dont have to worry about dependencies or how to run backend services.p  pAlready here I have a question. Ive seen other people building an image with the actual code inside instead of attaching it later, so whats the best case if theres one Ive done this way since I can reuse that image for every project and avoid building different images.p  pFor startingstoppingrestarting docker containers I created a script that does all of that, so I can make some changes to the code, bring it down and up again.p  pIt kinda works, and what I mean is, Im well aware this is not a normal workflow of a Java developer to do that kind of stuff from a console. So now, to the most important question, how do you integrate docker with a Java IDE I know that you can create custom buildrun commands but I also read that things like logs are not displayed on the IDEs.p  pCan someone explain me how are you using Docker  Java IDEsp  pNote Maven is also used for compiling java code, like codemvn clean installcode if this helpsp

Negative 20194 pIm inserting ImageSpans inside TextViews, which are part of a RecyclerView. Most of the time it works fine, but as you scroll up and down sometimes the TextView height is wrong for no obvious reason  theres too much vertical whitespace.p  pIn this layout on a specific device, the correct height for a TextView with 1 line of text is 48, and the wrong height is 80 I got these values from HierarchyViewer. The interesting thing is that the correct height for a TextView with 1 line of text including an ImageSpan is 80. So what seems to be happening is as the TextView gets recycled by RecyclerView, it sometimes keeps the height representing its old content which included an ImageSpan.p  pThis screenshot shows the Anore and Halal blahs TextViews as being 80 pixels high, which is wrong. The Hello TextView is correct at 48 pixels.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdwY81.png altWrong height 80p  pWhile investigating this I opened DDMS and ran Dump UI hierarchy and something interesting happened the TextView heights corrected themselves on the flyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc5A0j.png altCorrect height 48p  pThats pretty compelling evidence that the problem is TextView isnt being laid out properly after updating the text, so I tried various ways of calling forceLayout and invalidate on the TextView and its parent views, but it didnt help.p  pI tried replacing RecyclerView with ListView, no luck. I tried having all ImageSpans use the same drawable, no luck.p  pI ran HierarchyViewer but it didnt fix the layouts like UI Automator did.

Negative 20194 pI have a question regarding my programming approach for android  whether its efficient or not. Just to give you an idea what I try to accomplishp  pThere are multiple points of interests on a map. If the user gets nearer to a PIT, a notification about the distance shall appear. There are lets say 3 notifications At a distance of 1 mile, 0.5 miles and 0.1 mile. When the user is more or less exactly at the PIT, no more notifications are shown. The user is supposed to drive a car or another vehicle.p  pIm currently using Geofences to detect whether the user has entered a radius of 1 mile. If so, I check the distance of his current location to the PIT. If its about 0.5 or 0.1 miles away, a notification is fired. Therefore, I check the current location frequently right now every 10 seconds. If the user is like at the PIT or rather very close, the Geofence is exited and done. p  pThe code is working fine and this approach is the first thing that came to my mind while reading the Android Developers tutorials etc. But is there another approach that is MORE EFFICIENT p  pAlthough this is currently meeting my needs, I have two major concernsp  ol lipIt seems to drain the battery quite a lot. Since the user is most likely to be in a car where he can charge his phone during usage, this might be less of a problem. pli lipI read the number of PITs from a file on the SD card. In my example I have just a few PITs. But the user is able to modify the source data so that he can add as many as he wants to. Google says that only 100 active Geofences are supported per user. But what if my user has more than 100 PITs Since Im using a Geofence to sense whether I have to fire the first notification or not  this is a severe problem. So is there an alternativepli ol
Negative 20194 pOK, I have been working on a couple of demo project with libgdx, but I did not have an android device at that time, so I could not test them. I recently bought a tablet and I decided to see if my projects ran on the device connected by USB.p  pI enabled the USB debugging mode, created a new libgdx project and tested. It works. So the problem is not the connection, but the other projects I am trying to run.p  pThe first project was written while reading the libgdx book. Since by the time I first codded the app I had to reinstall my computer, my android version increased and it was a pain to make it work again with the new version. So it could be the source of the problem. Running as desktop works fine, running as android gives me the following errorsp  blockquote   p[20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Dx warning Ignoring   InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class   com.sun.jna.win32.W32APIOptions2 that doesnt come with an   associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced   by a compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The   recommended solution is to recompile the class from source, using an   uptodate compiler and without specifying any target type options.   The consequence of ignoring this warning is that reflective operations   on this class will incorrectly indicate that it is emnotem an inner   class.p blockquote  pIt gives me 15 copies of that message because there are 15 classes in the core project.  I tried cleaning all projects but it did not works. Then the errors continue with thisp  blockquote   p[20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Dx  trouble processing   javaxxmlnamespaceQName.classp      pIlladvised or mistaken usage of a core class java. or javax. when   not building a core library.p      pThis is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in   your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If   you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this   is the most likely explanation of whats going on.p      pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core   namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a   nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not   work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with   future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable   legality.p      pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only   appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution,   as opposed to compiling an application  then use the   corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p      pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an   application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail   to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers   who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once   they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this   problem.p      pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core   package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage   that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package   namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core   system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor.   If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that   the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief,   and lamentation.p      p[20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Dx 1 error aborting   [20150419 090837  CyberGliderandroid] Conversion to Dalvik   format failed with error 1p blockquote  hr  pThen I also have a second app which was started on my new installed computer.

Negative 20194 pI am a beginner with programming and there is concept im not understanding about headers files. Sorry if my question is a bit long, but i need to be precise to get good answer that actually answer what i dont understand.p  pWhat im told is that headers files is made to separate concept about the actual code and that the cpp files is the code.p  pI actually know why headers files in a medium to big program is a must and i actually use them, but im running into problem when i listen to tutorials that explain it. A lot of time i have problem with linking errors, like the header files ignore the cpp files. I found out i can actually include cpp files and everything then compile and run as i expected too. The catch is, i also know its not conventional and may cause problem dont actually know how though. So im really stuck with how to actually use more efficiently .h files.p  pSo knowing all this What are the different use of headers files and why and also, Why include .cpp should be avoided as most as possiblep  pThank you in advance p

I understand a PHP solution would use the servers datetime, while javascript would use the browsers datetime, so I selected javascript for the conditional formatting based on datetime. I also understand that javascript needs to wait until the whole page loads, including the result of the php query. I also understand that I know very little about javascript and php.pli lipBelow is the html and php code I have. This php queries the first 10 events and presents them in a list ordered by date in a bootstrap table. The codediv timecodecode is which I would like to conditionally format this sample php code does not contain the pagination php code, and returns the first 10 records from the databasep  precodeltdiv classrowgt ltdiv classvenuelistagt ltdiv classcolsm9 colmd9 collg9gt lttable classtablegt codepre    precodelttbodygt  ltphp      while row  mysqlfetchassocrsresult      gt lttrgt     lttd classcolmd7gt         ltdiv idtimecode paddingright5pxgtltphp echo row[esemenydispmmdd] gtltdivgt         ltdiv classeventListTitlegtltphp echo row[esemenycim] gtltbrgtltphp echo row[esemenyjelleg] gtltdivgt     lttdgt     lttd classcolmd5gt         ltdiv classeventListTitlegtltphp echo row[esemenyhelyszin] gt         ltdivgt     lttdgt lttrgt     ltphp           gt lttbodygt lttablegt      ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  ppli ol  pIn the Mysql database I have and event date field and a separate event time field.p  ol start3 lipAnd this is the javascript I found on the net, maybe on this site, to format the codediv timecodecode on the basis of its datetime this is just testing if it works against a fix date  it doesp  precodeltscriptgt document.readyfunction  var curtime  new Date, curday  curtime.getDate, curmonth  curtime.getMonth1 ifcurmonth  7 ampamp curday  20 timecode.addClasscircledisappearblue else timecode.addClasscircledisappeargrey  ltscriptgt codepreli lipProblem javascript only formats the very first php result of the list.

The example Im going to use is incrementing a value, but I have more complicated scenarios so Im looking for a general solution, not an answer for specifically incrementing.p  pHow I used to do it is Id either have multiple functions codeIncrementPassengerCountcode, codeIncrementDistanceTravelledcode, codeIncrementPlaneAgecode, but thats unweildly and horrible. p  pId like one general function that I can call using something like this pseudocodep  precodeIncrementmyPlane, myPlane.DistanceTravelled IncrementmyPlane, myPlane.PlaneAge  where  public void IncrementAirplane myPlane, Property propToIncrement       myPlane.propToIncrement or do whatever like I now have myPlane.DistanceTravelled  codepre  pIve tried thisp  precodeIncrementmyPlane, x gt x.DistanceTravelled  where  public void IncrementAirplane myPlane, FuncltLog, IComparablegt property       propertymyPlane  codepre  pBut this causes a p  blockquote   pOperator  cannot be applied to operand of type System.IComparablep blockquote  pIs there a way to do what Im imagining or am I looking at it wrong Thanks in advance.p

Negative 20194 pI think my problem is environmental, but I have tapped everything I can think of to find it.  The code was working fine 3 weeks ago, and suddenly stopped a few days ago.  I havent updated the OS or PHP in that timeframe.p  pIm using passwordhash to create a password from a POST variable, and then writing it to a MySQL database field set to varchar255.  After the problem came up I added test code to do passwordverify on the variable in memory before writing to the database, and then reread the value from the database after writing it there.  In both cases it returns as a match. However, any other page trying to run passwordverify returns as a mismatch.  I have captured the initial hash and visually compared it to the value in the database and they are identical.  Both servers the one that generates the hash and the one that reads it when the user logs in are both running the same version of php 5.6.90deb8u1.p  pHeres my complete code in its current state of debugging.  In the code below the commented out line using PASSWORDDEFAULT is what I was originally using.  I tried BCRYPT option just to see if it would fix it.  I also tried putting POST[password] into a variable instead of calling it directly, and wrapping a trim around it.  Everything seems fine until I leave this page and try from another page.  I have also checked the items discussed in other posts on the web.p  precodeUSER DOES NOT EXIST  mysqliclosecon if mysqliconnecterrno      echo Failed to connect to MySQL  . mysqliconnecterror     error  true   New user  add them to database echo Creating your account. ltbrgt pwd  POST[password] password  passwordhashtrimPOST[password], PASSWORDDEFAULT     password  passwordhashpwd, PASSWORDBCRYPT    echo password . ltbrgt   sel  CALL spadduser.

Since i need the login step in the beginning I wanted to create the object somewhere, and on creating, log in automatically.p  pNow my questionsp  ul liWhere to define the Class in the ember frameworkli liWhere to createstore the object after creation needs to be singleton since the login is only valid while the socket is openli liHow to access the Object, when i need to send requests.li ul  pSample Login requestp  pRequestp  precode     type request,     subtype apilogin,     id 1234,     data          username ltstringnullgt,         password ltstringnullgt,         token ltstringnullgt       codepre  pAnswerp  precode     type answer,     subtype apilogin,     id 1234,     error 0,     errormessage ,     data          token ltstringgt       codepre  pThe token is just another way to login which is valid up to 15 minutes after the socket closes. To reconnect after network errors or similar.p  pSince i have never really done something like this Im kinda having problems as where to put stuff in the framework and how to access them.p

to move but that just causes the footer to come all the way up the page. I cant use absolute postioning on the footer because their are four different databound pages that use the default.aspx and they all return a different amount of products. Ive tried forcing the defaultrow to set widths pixels, ems, and percentage and it doesnt appear to change anything at all.p  pI have worked around this issue by not displaying the menu at small screen sizes working on using a databound droplist instead but at 51em the screen is big enough that a side menu makes more sense.p  pWhat am I missing herep

Negative 20194 pSo for a set of tables I am trying to get personIds for people who are students which is a slow query 30 seconds so in an attempt to speed things up I am trying to make a view out of this.p  pThis question is about the view. I have a view with 1 int column and 1,000,000 rows.p  pA simple codeSELECT [PersonId] FROM [yodalat].[dbo].[personview]codep  pstill takes  25 seconds to complete. I am going to suggesting caching the result of this to the people developing for this database but am wondering what else I can do to speed this up.p  pThe query the view is built from shouldnt matter once the view is created yes I see stuff about adding indexes for more complicated selects, but I am literally trying to grab every value for this single column which is the only column of the view.p

Negative 20194 pIm having trouble wrapping my head around CakePHPs Collectionreduce. Actually, it feels like I understand how its supposed to work, but in reality it seems to work differently. I have a collection of entities, from which Im trying to concat a number of strings, based on the contents of another array. The array has an ID, the collection has that ID as a sort of foreign ID. I loop through the array, and then in each loop I loop through the collection to find the entities which have a foreign ID matching the ID from the array. Implementing this with Collectionreduce gives a wildly different result from doing it with two foreach loops.

Negative 20194 pI am new to the file handling concepts. I recently went through a program to count the number of houseno starting with 13 present in a file of structures. struct house      int houseno[5] s[4] After writing to the file its contents are like this 1234 1342 1245p  pThe aim was to find the housenos which start with 13. In the program before reading the contents in a while loop the below line is writtenp  pfile.seekgiosbegp  pAfter going through the tutorials i could understand that seekg is used to make the file point to the a particular location and this case the beginning of the file. To understand this better i tried the program with and without this line. Without this line , it gives the count only if the first 2 chars are 1 and 3.  For example without the line it will provide the below outputp  pFile contents  1323 1234 1324p  pOutput 1p  pAfter including the line it gives 2 as the output.  Now my doubt is since this statement is used before the while loop for reading from the file begins how can it matter for subsequent objects.p  pPlease help me.p
Negative 20194 pIm maintaining code for a web application built using Asp.NET MVC. An MVC dependency resolver has been implemented using Unity container. Heres the cleanup code thats called on application shutdown.p  precode public static void Shutdown                       IUnityContainer container  UnityConfig.GetConfiguredContainer         container.Dispose currently when called causes stack overflow               codepre  pThe issue were having is that during a shutdown the call to dispose above causes a stack overflow exception and then the process crashes because of it. This also occurs during development when debugging the app and making changes to web.config since changes to web.config seems to restart the application which also stops the debugging session which normally shouldnt end. No stack overflow seems to occur if I remove the call to dispose, and the application then exits or restarts normally without the process crashing during debugging sessions. p  pIm thinking of simply permanently removing the call to Dispose but Im uncertain of the consequences, wouldnt an application shut down inevitably lead to the disposing of the container anyway p  pIf removing the call to dispose is not recommended then the only option would be to find the real cause which I believe lie in a circular dependency within the container itself, but I cant find it, how should I debug this issue p

Negative 20194 pI have a use case to indexing data from kafka into elasticsearch. Elasticsearch has a bulk API, which bundles multiple messages together in one API call for indexing. It is much more efficient than doing indexing one by one on each message. p  pI am using Clojure to do this. naturally, I would like to use core.async, consuming messages from kafka and input into a channel, buffered for some time or when the channel has enough messages before indexing them in one elasticsearch bulk API call.p  pThe problem is the output of the channel will be signaled as long as there is one message coming in. p  pOne simple solution is buffering the incoming messages from the output of the channel in a blocking queue, but that sounds like to defeat the purpose of using channel. why not just using a blocking queue without channelp  pAny suggestion to use channel for batch processing  thanks. p

Within those playbooks they each include the common role. Some inventory files I have all my groups run on one single host. Another inventory file I have a host per group. For the case where ever group is on one host, if I run site.yml you can see that the common role is getting played twice, one for webservers.yml and one for dbservers.yml.p  pWhat is a solution to avoid this I guess you can take out the common role from webservers.yml and dbservers.yml and instead within site.yml have a task that targets both with the common role.
