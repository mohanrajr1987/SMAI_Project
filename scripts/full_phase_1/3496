Negative 3496 pWe have a large highperformance software system which consists of multiple interacting Java processes not EJBs. Each process can be on the same machine or on a different machine. p  pCertain events are generated in one process, and are then propagated in different ways to other processes for further processing and so on.p  pFor benchmarking purposes, we need to create a log of when each event passed through a checkpoint, eventually combine these logs to obtain a timeline of how each event propagated through the system and with what latency of course, process switching and IPC adds latency, which is ok. p  pThe problem, of course, is clock synchronization. So here are my questionsp  p1 If all processes are on the same machine, is it guaranteed that currentTimeMilis would be accurate at the time of call Is there some bound on the errors of ITPp  p2 If some processes may be on different machines, is there an offtheshelf solution that is also free or opensource for clock synchronization I am preferably looking for a solution that may bypass the operating system Windows or Linux and work straight from Java.

Ive thought about NTP, but Im not sure if its available via Java rather than through the OS, and I am not sure about its complexity.p  p3 Is there a way to determine the margin of error in using NTP in a particular configuration or of any solution I end up using so that I can give a margin of error on our calculation of the latencyp  pThanksp

Negative 3496 pI want to make a program that parses an XML file and then updates labels on 2 different tab bar views.  On both of these views, I have a refresh button to update the results.  What Id like to do is update both of the views labels from either view.  I figure the AppDelegate is probably a good choice to make this happen, but I tried creating classes that the AppDelegate can access but since theyre instances of a class they contain no values.  I get no errors but the labels dont update even though the data changes.  This is the method in my AppDelegate that is called after the XML is parsedp  precodevoidcallUpdateValues      NSLogCalling Update from AppDelegate     home homeController     data dataController     [homeController updateValues]     [dataController updateValues]      codepre  pOne of the update methods looks likep  precode voidupdateValues  NSLogCall Home [label1 setText [[[[totalData objectAtIndex0] objectForKeynodeChildArray] objectAtIndex7] valueForKeynodeContent]] [label2 setText[[[[totalData objectAtIndex0] objectForKeynodeChildArray] objectAtIndex1] valueForKeynodeContent]]  codepre  pSo the view calls the AppDelegate method callUpdateValues and then that method should call the individual updateValues methods in each view.

The problem becomes when entering the image into the editor.

Negative 3496 pIm trying to use OAuth in an Android app. I have it working correctly but have sometimes run into a problem during the authentication phase. In Android, I launch the browser for the user to login and authenticate. Then the callback url will redirect back to my application.p  pHere is the problem. My application has a OAuth consumer and provider as members of my main class. When the browser is launched for authentication, sometimes my main Activity is discarded to save memory.

Negative 3496 pIve got an app written with StrutsTilesJSP that Im adding a GWT app to.

That way I can tell the browser to cache those css files forever and when I deploy a new version all my users download it immediately.p  pNow Im moving on to the GWT app and I love how it uses longmd5sum.cache.css as the filename so I can still tell the browser to cache it forever.  The problem is that the css files associated with my theme, like gwtstandard.css, dont have a strong name and dont have my svnbuild parameter attached.  Whenever I deploy a new version of my app, users are still seeing the old version of the css which makes it look wrong.p  pHas anyone figured out a best practice for handling caching of gwt theme css files  Is there a way I can append an svnbuild parameter or something similar when appending the css to the documentp
Negative 3496 pI come from an MVC background Flex and Rails and love the ideas of code separation, reusability, encapsulation, etc.  It makes it easy to build things quickly and reuse components in other projects.  However, it has been very difficult to stick with the MVC principles when trying to build complex, statedriven, asynchronous, animated applications.p  pI am trying to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2083516bestpracticefortransitioningfromnestedstatetonestedstateseediagramcreate animated transitions between many nested views in an applicationa, and it got me thinking about whether or not I was misleading myself...  Can you apply principles from MVC to principles from Artificial Intelligence BehaviorTrees, Hierarchical State Machines, Nested States, like Games  Do those two disciplines play nicely togetherp  pIts very easy to keep the viewsgraphics ignorant of anything outside of themselves when things are static, like with an HTML CMS system or whatever.  But when you start adding complex statedriven transitions, it seems like everything needs to know about everything else, and the MVC almost gets in the way.  What do you thinkp  pUpdatep  pAn example.  Well right now I am working on a website in Flex.  I have come to the conclusion that in order to properly animate every nested element in the application, I have to think of them as AI Agents.  Each View, then, has its own Behavior Tree.  That is, it performs an emactionem shows and hides itself based on the emcontextem what the selected data is, etc..  In order to do that, I need a ViewController type thing, Im calling it a Presenter.  So I have a View the graphics laid out in MXML, a Presenter defining the animations and actions the View can take based on the state and nested states of the application, and a Presentation Model to present the data to the View through the presenter.  I also have Models for value objects and Controllers for handling URLs and database calls etc... all the normal statichtmllike MVC stuff.p  pFor a while there I was trying to figure out how to structure these agents such that they could respond to their surrounding context whats selected, etc..  It seemed like everything needed to be aware of everything else.  And then I read about a PathNavigation TableList for games and immediately thought they have a centrallystored table of all precalculated actions every agent can take.  So that got me wondering how they actually structure their code.p  pAll of the 3D video game stuff is a big secret, and a lot of it from what I see is done with a graphical UIeditor, like defining behavior trees.  So Im wondering if they use some sort of MVC to structure how their agents respond to the environment, and how they keep their code modular and encapsulated.p

Negative 3496 pI am using OAuth with google data api. We have a portal only for authorized users. So when users are logged in and if they are accessing calendar page, they will be asked if they want to sync their calendars with google calendar. If yes, they will be redirected for authentication. Once user has granted access, google appends OAuthToken to the callback URL. the callback URL was that of the page of calendar in portal. This url has its query string options encrypted. But when the redirection happens , it takes back to login page of url. p  purl is like stronghttpaaa.xyz.comencrypted part of query stringstrong and after oauthtoken is authorized, this url becomesp  pstronghttpaaa.xyz.comencrypted part of query stringampoauthtokenstrong. So the user sees the login page after redirection instead of original page. How should I handle this in code. p

Please be aware of that the ItemsSource of the ListBox is bound to an ObservabaleCollection in the viewmodel. This colletion is populated fast.

Negative 3496 pI am dealing a big situation in architecture design flaw in multiple threading. I try to keep my application completely thread safe and avoid conflict with each others.p  pThe problem I was aware was thisp  pAssume there are two threads, bThread Ab and bThread Bb.p  pbThread Ab is something that youll see from Static Void Main method as the only thread.p  pbThread Ab create an object that have asynchronous methods of StartStop and apply event handling to that object. p  pWhen Start method was called in the object from bThread Ab, it creates a new thread for that object to process the information from object properties or inputs which is bThread Bb. In my case, network receiving and sending processes in my own protocol.p  pWhen object in bThread Bb completed in receiving a new information from the input or property, bThread Bb invoke the event in the object to pass the data along to bThread Ab.p  pThe problem is, when the event was invoked, it was managed by bThread Bb instead. bThread Bb was suppose to run only on that object to continue to do the processing method, but instead it go through to another object and later have cross threading conflict between bThread Ab and bThread Bb when it is suppose to pass an event to bThread Ab for bThread Ab alone to handle that new output. p  pIf bThread Ab is the one that initialize the object and the class it was running on, how come when the event was invoked, it runs on bThread Bb insteadp  pI needed bThread Bb to continue to loop forever and not interrupt the program by passing event information to bThread Ab.p  pPlease excuse my English and Grammar and thank you for your patience. p  p[EDIT x4] If you want to get the source code, it is located here a hrefhttpfcpfoundation.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpfcpfoundation.codeplex.coma It is up now.p  pYou can find the source code in the link above.

Negative 3496 pCurrently my company has a 3 server setup. 2 web boxes behind a loadbalancer and another box not behind the loadbalancer used for Admin, CMS and stats. Due to the state of funds at the moment we are looking to decommission our single box which is not behind the loadbalancer. The box has our CMS on it and a media subdomain points to homewebmedia on that box. The problem is if we remove the box and port all the code PHP over to the loadbalanced web boxes, then when a file is uploaded in the CMS it will only upload it to the media directory of the box the user hits. So if a user hits web1 and uploads a file that file will only be accessible in the homewebmedia directory of web1.

Negative 3496 pIve been searching the web and Im finding somewhat contradictory answers. Some sources assert that a languagemachinewhathaveyou is Turing complete if and only if it has strongbothstrong conditional and unconditional branching which I guess is kind of redundant, some say that only unconditional is required, others that only conditional is required.p  pReading about the German a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiZ328computer29Z3a and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiENIACENIACa, Wikipedia saysp  blockquote   pThe German Z3 shown working in May   1941 was designed by Konrad Zuse. It   was the first generalpurpose digital   computer, but it was   electromechanical, rather than   electronic, as it used relays for all   functions. It computed logically using   binary math. It was programmable by   punched tape, but lacked the   conditional branch. While not designed   for Turingcompleteness, it   accidentally was, as it was found out   in 1998 but to exploit this   Turingcompleteness, complex, clever   hacks were necessary.p blockquote  pWhat complex, clever hacks, exactlyp  pA 1998 paper Abstract by R. Rojas also states Note that I havent read this paper, its just a snippet from IEEE.p  blockquote   pThe computing machine Z3, built by   Konrad Zuse between 1938 and 1941,   could execute only fixed sequences of   floating point arithmetical operations   addition, subtraction,   multiplication, division, and square   root coded in a punched tape. An   interesting question to ask, from the   viewpoint of the history of computing,   is whether or not these operations are   sufficient for universal computation.   The paper shows that, in fact, a   single program loop containing these   arithmetical instructions can simulate   any Turing machine whose tape is of a   given finite size. This is done by   simulating conditional branching and   indirect addressing by purely   arithmetical means. Zuses Z3 is   therefore, at least in principle, as   universal as todays computers that   have a bounded addressing space.p blockquote  pIn short, SOers, what type of branching is exactly required for Turingcompleteness Assuming infinite memory, can a language with only a codegotocode or codejmpcode branching construct no codeifcode or codejnzcode constructs be considered Turingcompletep

I do not yet know about performance, however this approach looks promising. p  pIn more detail I use XrmDataContext for LINQbased access to MS CRM.

Negative 3496 pIm measuring some system performance data to store it in a database. From those data points Im drawing line graphs over time. In their nature, those data points are a bit noisy, ie. every single point deviates at least a bit from the local mean value. When drawing the line graph straight from one point to the next, it produces jagged graphs. At a large time scale like  10 data points per pixel, this noise is compressed into a wide jagged line area that is, say, 20px high instead of 1px as in smaller scales.p  pIve read about line smoothing, antialiasing, simplifying and all these things. But everything Ive found seems to be about something else.p  pI dont need antialiasing, .NET already does that for me when drawing the line on the screen.p  pI dont want simplification.

Negative 3496 pIll ask my question first, then give some background for those who are interestedp  pI would like to know if there is a command in html that will automatically generate a bibliography from a .bib file  This means that throughout the text, i would add something like codeltcite nameJones2010gtcode, and then at the bottom of the html or css file, I would write something like codeltmakebib filebiblist.bib, formatAPAgtcode, and a bibliography would be generated using my .bib file, and formated according to the APA style. The functionality would be quite similar to footnotes, except that each footnote is populated according to some script that extracts the information from essentially an xml file and outputs the content in the desired format.  It is not difficult to imagine somebody creating a tool to do just that, however, my google search skills have not enabled me to find such a tool.  It is easy to find tools that convert bib files to html or xml, but that is not sufficient for my needs.  I do not desire to publish my entire bib file online.  Rather, for each document that I generate, I want several of the entries in the bib file to be included as footnotes.  Any pointers will be greatly appreciated.p  pNow, the reason behind the questionp  pI have recently begun switching from writing all my manuscripts using latex to writing them using htmlcss.  The advantages of this approach are fast only 1 file for versioning instead of .dvi, .ps, .aux, .blg, etc., it is much smaller to share, other people can edit the html file and compile it much more easily, it is more configurable to my tastes, easier to read on screen, etc.  The disadvantage for me, however, is that while Ive been writing in latex for years, Ive only just begin using html and css for scientific document creating.  The main impetus for the switch was MathJaX, which enables me to to embed latex equations in my html files, and therefore, allows me to combine the advantages of latex with the advantages of css.  I imagine that nearly all my colleagues will switch away from latex to this simpler format, assuming a few remaining issues get resolved, like ease of creating bibliographies.  p  pMany thanks.p

Well, Im using a source control so this is not that hard, but performing Undo on a couple dozen of files every time I change a bit in another file is a damn disaster.  p  pI have tried to use [DesignerSerializationVisibility] attribute to fix this issue.

Negative 3496 pIm working on a software solution to for a group of applications running on the same server.p  pThe applications are loosely related, and share an event log.  The problem that we are running into is performance, with each application making calls to the database every time they need to log an event.p  pWhat Im trying to do is decouple the entire process by removing the applications direct calls to the database, and routing them through a service running on the machine whos sole purpose is processing events from the multiple applications on the machine.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9v8FS.png altEvent Helper Service  Imagep  pUltimately my goal is to implement some sort of system in the Event Helper Object that would allow those objects to communicate directly with the Event Service.p  pMy first instinct was to use your typical event, but it would appear from the research that Ive done that it is not possible to invoke an event in one process to be handled in another process.p  pAs a part of my research I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17878listenforeventsinanotherapplicationListen for events in another applicationa and a hrefhttpboycook.wordpress.com20080729cwin32messagingwithsendmessageandwmcopydata relnofollowC Win32 messaging with SendMessagea.p  pSendmessage looks like a promising solution, but I wanted to be sure so I spoke with one of my colleagues who was close to the project the original developer who was moved on to a new project before the completion of this one and he imparted some additional information as to the situation.

Negative 3496 pFrom searching elsewhere on this site and the web, tail call optimization is not supported by the JVM.

Negative 3496 pIm still somewhat new to multithreading so maybe this is an easy answer, but I tried searching around with locks and synchronized methods but this isnt working out right.p  pI have a system which connects to an ftp site and downloads an xml file to process. The application waits until the file on the ftp site is updated, if it isnt updated it doesnt do anything. If it is updated it downloads the xml file to start processing.p  pBefore we process the xml we check the version of a file on the server, and the version of something in the database, if the versions arent the same, create a new thread and update the file on the server to the new version.p  pSo in code its pretty muchp  precodeiffile.version.equalsdb.version     do work...  else     startUpdateThread   private synchronized void startUpdateThread     Runnable updateRunnable  new UpdateRunnable    Thread updateThread  new ThreadupdateRunnable    updateThread.start  codepre  pThe problem Im having is that the xml file will change on the ftp site in the middle of updating the file on the server and still enter the startUpdateThread method and by the time its finished I will have multiple threads trying to accomplish the same tasks.p  pMy question I guess is, why is the syncrhonized method still being called even though it should be locked, and if Im doing it wrong what is the correct way to approach this without creating multiple threads to accomplish the same tasks.p  pstrongeditstrong A little further explanation of the system, the file on the server gets loaded into a cache when the application starts, so the file.version.equals is really from a cache. The file only needs to be regenerated once every few months its something that is done manually that I am going to make automated. p  pThe file on the server and the xml file have nothing to do with each other, it just happens that this check is triggered when the application sees the file on the server has changed which is roughly every two minutes. To generate a new file and load it into cache takes about 10 minutes. So the check happens about 5 times, thus creating 5 threads, regenerating a file.p  pThe desired result isp  pNormal processing to continue with the xml filep  pONE new thread being created to reload a totally seperate file on the server.p  pHopefully that makes better sense...p

Negative 3496 pI have been asked to create a graphical programming IDE for embedded 8bit and 32bit microcontrollers.  It needs to be as easy as using LabVIEW, but I dont need features like debugging or simulating at least for now.  Basically the application needs to allow the user to configure logic gates, whilefor loops, case statements, comparisons, flow control, etc.  Once the program is finished it should generate the C code, compile and write the program on the connected microcontroller.  Right now were are targeting Atmel and Freescale processors and will be using DIO, analog IO for current sensing, CAN bus, PWM, and probably some more that Im missing.p  pI realize that this is a HUGE undertaking that will take a very long time to develop, but its software that my company wants to provide customers when they buy our hardware.  To back up a bit and give you a little background information, our company builds IO modules that work on CAN bus or standalone.  Today, the only way to program the microcontoller on our PCB is to use the IDE from Atmel AVR Studio or Freescale CodeWarrior.  The problem is that the customer does not always have the knowhow to program in C.  So... enter the graphical IDE.  LabVIEW is too expensive for the customer, so were stuck with creating our own.p  pSo my question is what is a good way to create this IDE  I am planning on developing this in CWPF, but Im wondering how hard it will be to convert the logic that the user created into C code that can be compiled by the AtmelFreescale compiler.  Or perhaps there is a better method out there  Has anyone done anything like thisp

If the php generated by Wordpress is reasonable, this seems doable in theory.p  pThe other way would be to take the html genrated by his php and use that as my starting point for hooking into my php processing files and database.p  pHe sent me a dump of the files created after he created a simple webpage and there seemed to be a lot of extra stuff in there.p  pCan anyone with experience in this comment  Im hoping theres an easy way to do this.p  pThanks.p

Negative 3496 pDoing some initial research on a new project and one of my requirements is to implement a 3D display that will render a set of data that is updating at a frequency between 20ms  500ms.  So every using the lower limit 20ms new data will be available from an external resource specialty hardware and this data needs to be provided to the 3d view and rendered ASAP.  For the sake of this question, you can think of the analogy of a weather station sampling data every 20ms and the requirement to push that data to a consuming service or object.  emExcept for this example the weather station is connected to the consuming application so no need for networking, etc.emp  pIm a hack desktop developer, mostly just writing apps for my own manufacturing business, rarely enjoying the luxury of learning the underlying technologies that I take for granted with .net  So with that disclaimer in place let me explain what Im pondering I originally thought I could just use a delegate and fire off events from the hardware component each time a new data set was ready.  This is easy enough and 50 method calls a second doesnt seem TOO abusive 0p  pBut then I thought, hey, maybe I should use a stream for this and then quickly realized I dont understand Streams enough to know if this is a good idea or not.  Based on what I have read and my experience with Streams working with files, HttpRequests, etc. it seems like it may be a good option to move data from one subsystem to another at a high frequency.  Conceptually I picture the hardware component the object interfacing with the hardware writing to the stream each time it finishes acquiring a new set of data, then my 3D view would be reading from this stream and rendering it.p  pI have questions thoughp  ol liThis is basic, but I dont understand how the code reading from the stream knows when there is new data to be read.  For example, if a new data set is written to the stream i a separate thread of course how would the reader know when that data was availableli liDoes the serialization and deserialization of my MeasurementDataReading object wipe out the performance gains from using a Stream rather than a delegate approachli liAm I completely misunderstanding the intent of Streams  I realize that it is not one continuous stream of data Im working with, bur rather many small pieces with delays between.li ol

Negative 3496 pIm writing an app using WPF, Entity framework and SQLServer, all very run of the mill stuff. I was having a look at what calls get made to the database using sql profiler and found quite a few unnecessary calls. The first one was solved pretty easy but I have included it for anyone reading this thread in the future. Assuming I have a table structure with 3 tables like this InvoiceInvoiceDetailProductp  p1 When I load up an Invoice object, it will then execute a seperate statement to retrieve each InvoiceDetail item. This is solved pretty easy by using the Include statement, eg p  precodecontext.Invoices.IncludeInvoiceDetails.Wherei gt i.Something  somethingelse codepre  p2 When I delete an Invoice the database has a cascade delete which automatically deletes all of the InvoiceDetails. However EF still insists on calling a delete for each of the InvoiceDetail objects that it has in memory. If an invoice has 100 items on it then it will execute 101 statements instead of 1. This is bad.p  p3 In addition to the extra statements executed in point 2, assuming each InvoiceDetail object points to a product and I have caused the products to loaded into memory this would happen if I showed the invoice before I deleted it then EF executes a useless update statement on every product In fact this update statement is more than useless because if someone else has changed something about the product in the mean time then this code will change the data back If Im logging changes then we get useless log entries. I suspect it is doing this because Product would have had an InvoiceDetails collection which has had some items removed, but the Product itself has not changed so why the updatep  pThanks for reading Cheers, Michaelp

Negative 3496 pWhen we create a directshow filter and register it, static variablesfunctions are shared in multiple instances of the same filter. I believe this also applies to other ActiveX controls. For instance if I try to use something likep  precodestatic int counter  0  void someFunction      counter      trace result here  codepre  pIf I start another instance of the same filter, second instance doesnt start from 0 but where first instance counter left. And then they start to increase the same counter asynchronously.p  pMy question is, is there any smart way to block sharing between static variables for DirectShow filters It may sound silly but if we register the same filter with different GUID by recompiling the same project with a different GUID and file output, static variables are not shared anymore because they are two different filters, right So, is there any way I can simulate this using the same filter but keeping the staticsp  pWhat am I trying to do is to use a library with many static usage in it. Getting rid of all the static variablesfunctions is very hard. the library im trying to use uses old standards like Ansi C and doesnt have a real object oriented design. So, encapsulation is not very easy. Most of the functions are in the global space, not in classes. Please keep that in mind. If I leave the statics as they are, single instance of the filter works fine but other instances start getting messed up because of shared static variables.p

Negative 3496 pI have an iOS app with a really nasty bug an operation in my NSOperationQueue will for some reason hang and not finish executing so other additional operations are being queued up but still not executing. This in turn leads to the app not begin able to perform critical functions. I have not yet been able to identify any pattern other than that it occurs on one of my coworkers devices every week or so. Running the app from Xcode at that point does not help as killing and relaunching the app resolves the issue for the time being. Ive tried attaching the debugger to a running process and I seem to be able to see log data but any break points I add are not registering. Ive added a bread crumb trail of NSLogs to try to pinpoint where its hanging but this has not yet led to a resolution. p  pI originally described the bug in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8198899nsoperationqueuebecomessuspendedatrandomanother questiona which is yet to have a clear answer Im guessing because of the lack of info Im able to provide around this issue.p  pA friend once told me that its possible to save the entire memory stack of an app at a given moment in some form and reload that exact state of memory onto a process on a different device. Does anyone know how I can achieve that If thats possible the next time someone encounters that bug I can save that exact state of memory and replicate to test all my theories of possible solutions. Or is there a different approach to tackling this As an interim measure, do you think it would make sense to forcefully make the app crash when the app enters this state so actual users would be less confused Im have mixed feelings about this but the user will have to kill the app from the multitask dock anyway in order to use the app again. I can check the operation queue count or create some kind of timeout code for this until I actually nail this bug.p

Negative 3496 pI know the automatic setting is to have any models you define in models.py become database tables.p  pI am trying to define models that wont be tables.

It allowed me to do things like Trips.objects.all in any view, and pass that to any template, since it all came from one data source. Ive heard you can just not save the model instantiation, and then it doesnt save to the database, but I need to access this data that Ive assembled in one view, in multiple other views, to manipulate it and display it . . . if i dont save i cant access it, if i do save, then its in a database which would have concurrency issues with multiple usersp  pI dont really want to pass around a dictionarylist, and Im not even sure how i was do that if I had to.p  pideasp  pThanksp

I linked it appropriately in the Link Binary with Library section. Then, following standard suit, I set it up the client app to search for the header files at the following locationp  precodebuildsfoobarbuildheaders codepre  pAnd this works... sort of. If I delete the directory listed above and try to rebuild, it will fail because it cannot find the header files. p  blockquote   pWell, Duh You deleted the directory that contains the header files.p blockquote  pTrue, but the way the client build is setup is such that the static library is compiled and placed within buildsfoobarbuild directory including header files, before the client application builds. It SHOULD be finding these header files. They exist before the client is compiled, and the Header Search Path is set correctly.p  pAs I said before, if I delete the directory that contains the lib and header files, and try a clean build of the client application, it fails. Although the build fails, the buildsfoobarbuild directory gets created and populated, meaning all subsequent builds and cleans succeed.p  pAny idea how to fix this issuep

Negative 3496 pSo Im writing a test framework for a large website, and am currently working on modeling the UI driver.  I have a UI Session that abstracts a number of emulators and drivers for browsers and mobile devices.  this object also holds state information about the browser session, including a history of page objects, the top of which is the current page.  My problem is that I want my page objects to lazy load data from the browser properties set up with getters that check whether weve extracted the data, if not, whether this is the current page, and if so, pulls the data from the browser and caches it in the page object, but that means they need access to the abstraction layer provided by the session.p  pThe first idea of course was just sticking the session in the page, but that creates a circular reference, which is bad.  I also considered trying to define multiple interfaces for page, but I couldnt see how that would really work too well.  What I really want is to be able to intercept the call in session then have session redirect the call down to page to a hidden getter that also takes session as an argument, but I havent been able to figure out how to do that.p  pIs there a good solution or design pattern that I could use here to get the info and access I need where I need it without having circular references or giving up lazy loading  I dont want to make the interface more complicated by forcing users to sometimes call methods and sometimes call properties or members to access the same info the idea is to hide the fancy footwork behind the scenes and make using the framework dead simple.p  pI actually do have a CurrentPage class that all it does is store the currentpage in a class variable which is set by session on navigate events, so I suppose I could make currentpage a magic globalesque accessor that would be the only way to actually get data off the page and have it use a special interface and store the session object as well, but that seems clunky to me.p  pAnyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 3496 pI have a problem with changing the standard options used by an Axis 1.4 generated web service client code. We consume a certain web service of a partner who is using the old RPCEncoded style, which basically means were not able to go for Axis 2 but are limited to Axis 1.4.p  pThe service client is retrieving data from the remote server through our proxy which actually runs quite nicely.p  pOur application is deployed as a servlet. The retrieved response of the foreign web service is inserted into a XML document we provide to our internal systemsCMS. But if the external service is not responding  which didnt happen yet but might happen at anytime  we want to degrade nicely and return our produced XML document without the calculated web service information within a resonable time. The data retrieved is optional if this specific calculation is missing it isnt a big issue at all.p  pSo I tried to change the timeout settings. I did applyuse all methods and keys I could find in the documentation of axis to alter the connection and socket timeouts by searching the web.

Negative 3496 pIm trying to setup a JNDI resource for a Jackrabbit repository factory in Jetty. The problem is that I seem to be getting thhe JNDI as webapp scoped. I need it to be JVM scoped.

Negative 3496 pIm building a new application and am new to Domain Driven Design. Ive been reading through the documentation and Ive managed to model most of the domain model but I would like some advice about two queriesp  ol lipI have two domain objects channel and program. Ive modelled these both as entities as both can be accessed independantly. A channel can have a list of programs so I have put this as an attribute of channel. My query is how should I populate the program list. Is it OK for the getChannerById method in ChannelService to first get the channel information and then call the ProgramService to get the list of programs for the channels e.g p  precodeChannel    String channelId   List ltProgramgt programList   Program    String programId    ChannelService     Channel getChannelByIdString channelId   ProgramService       Program getProgramByIdString programId    List ltProgramgt getProgramsByChannelByIdString channelId    codepreli lipI have a product domain object but some of its attributes e.g. specification and compatability involve quite time consuming operations. These attributes are not required all the time so is it OK to put these as part of the domain object and have seperate service methods that populate these attributes when required e.g. p  precodeProduct      String productId     Specification specification     List ltProductgt compatibleProducts   ProductService      Product getProductString productId     void getProductSpecificationsProduct product     void getCompatibleProductsProduct product  codepreli ol  pAny advice would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 3496 pSo my problem is fairly simple. When I started to develop my website my default zoom level on my Firefox browser turned out to be, well, less than 100. Maybe 70 Which means that what I have designed so far is actually in zoomed out mode, which in turn means that my users or web visitors will see something that looks very zoomed in when they look at it with 100 mode. This can easily be solved by holding Ctrl and scrolling you mouse wheel twice. Obviously though I cant encourage people to do that.p  pSo,p  pIs there some function or property in either HTML, CSS or Javascript than can set the default zoom level to zoomed outp

Negative 3496 pFirst, Id like to describe my current situation. I have an RDLC whose data is taken from a dataset ds using Stored Procedure sp. Lets say that from ds I can get a field of type String called barcode, and in turn can be used in a placeholder combined with a 3of9 font to generate the barcode.p  pNow, Id like to obtain the same result, but using another method which, given a string, will return an image of barcode in BMP or JPEG format. This method is already described at a hrefhttpwww.techrepublic.combloghowdoihowdoigeneratebarcodesusingc173 relnofollowhttpwww.techrepublic.combloghowdoihowdoigeneratebarcodesusingc173a. p  pMy question  is it possible to write the method in the ReportViewer code behind .aspx.cs  If it is possible, how can I pass that barcode into this method and then embed the result the JPEG or BMP into the RDLC p

Negative 3496 pI have an offline processing server which charges me very little for cpu cycles and a media serving server which charges me very little for bandwidth.  I have a 1.3Mb zip file which the offline processing server generates and then sends over to the media serving server to actually host for download.  The way I had been doing this was by having the offline processing server make the file on himself and ftp it over to the other one, but I had to move hosts and now the offline processing server doesnt have the ability to save files to itself.  p  pMy first thought was I can make a listening php script on the media serving server and then post the contents to that script which will save it into a zip file.  Unzipped it is 4.1Mb so would it be a good idea to post this much data  The second thing I thought of was streams in php... but I didnt know what would be best.p  pWhat is the best way for me to move this 4.1Mb of data from one server to the other when I cant save it as a file in the server which generates the datap

Negative 3496 pI am timing my OpenGL frame rates, with vsync turned on, and notice my timings arent the precise frequency as set by the monitor.  That is, on my desktop I have a 60Hz refresh, but the FPS is stable at 59.88, whereas on my tablet its also 60Hz but the FPS can be 6162 FPS. Im curious as to what precisely causes these slight deviations.p  pThese are the ideas Ive had so farp  ol liDropped Frames This is the obvious answer Im just missing some frames. This is however not the cause as I can verify I am not dropping frames and the drop in FPS would be higher if this happened.  I calculate the time over 120 frames, so if 1 frame was lost the FPS would drop below 59.5 on the desktop.li liInaccurate timings I use clockgettime to get my timings. On Linux I know this is accurate enough as I previously did nanosecond based timings with it, but here we could even live with  several hundred microseconds. On Android however Im not sure of the accuracy of this.li liAPI Oddity I use glXSwapBuffers on the desktop and eglSwapBuffers on Android. There could be an oddity here, but I dont see how this could so subtley affect the frame rate.li liApproximate Hz This is my biggest guess that the video cardsmonitor arent actually running at 60Hz. This is probably tied to the exact speed of the monitor, and the video card frequency. This seems like something that could be concretely determined, but I dont know which tools can be used to do this. Update My current video mode in Linux shows  59.93Hz, so closer, but still not thereli ol  pIf the answer is indeed 4 this is perhaps not the best exchange site for the question. But in all cases my ultimate goal is to figure out programmatically what the ideal refresh rate actaully is. So Im hoping somebody can confirmdeny my ideas, and possibly point me in the right direction to getting the information I need.p

One of these is checking a wide amount of google analytics data in one view.  p  pCurrently I have no problems using the PHP Library provided by google to get the data and put it to good use.  p  pHowever, my problem is that my website has a simple login thats based on sessions, and on redirect back to my web application the session is destroyed, causing my login check to kick me back to my maintenance login.  What is the preferred way to maintain my first login upon authorization from googlep

Negative 3496 pEDIT Not related to NSAttributedString, OHAttributedLabel or TTTAttributedLabelp  pShort question Im using emUILabel,em OHAttributedLabel or TTTAttributedLabel with the same issue  scrolling the table view screws up the display of the label. More on that below...p  pLong form I have an NSAttributedString object representing the text from a tweet. Ive decorated the string based on various contents in the tweet e.g., hashtags are colored blue, urls are colored green and underlined, user mentions are red.p  pFor example, this tweetp  precode MeetGreen Keep up the good work.

The principal issue seems to be scrolling behavior  the cells do not plot correctly the text is in some strange position. However, if I simply select the cell by touching it, for example, the cell is plotted exactly as it should be. It makes me think the issue is with the table scrolling handling in my delegate methods and NOT the attributed label itself since the behavior is the same for OHAttributedLabel and TTTAttributedLabel, but Im not sure WHY that is. One thing I havent tried yet is plain text and a plain UILabel for the tweet content  thats on the list for tonight. strongOk, same behavior with UILabel and plain text content.

Negative 3496 pConsider functions f1 and f2 in for example Haskell or ML. Suppose f2 calls f1. Does type inference just use the information of what f1 can call, which amounts to just looking at the definition of f1. Or does it also look at how f2 calls f1 when doing type inference on f1. For example f2 might pass in literals when calling f1 which would restrict the argument types of f1.p

Negative 3496 pAlright I have a not so uncommon layout, its a wrapper element with 2 columns floating side by side with codefloatleftcode set on both columns. My problem isnt so much as getting either of the elements to line up with the bottom of the page. The problem is, when either element is larger than the page and exceeds the bounds of code100code And even then its not so much a problem with both elements as it is I want the left hand element to stretch with the right hand element.p  pWhat I have so far is a hrefhttpv2.newyorkbarshow.com relnofollowhttpv2.newyorkbarshow.comap  pAs you can see the element on the left already bleeds off the page, which is expected, not really desired but expected as its set to codeheight100minheight100code but it is also pushed down from the top by a margin as the header element is an absolute position element. In fact both the left and right hand sides are pushed down in the same mannor and both have the same height setting mentioned above. So the set themselves to the equivelant of what 100 should be had they not been pushed down by the margin. So like I said, undesired side effect but expected. p  pWhat you will also notice is in this example, the right side stretches further now, as there is content in it pushing it down. While the left side stays at its 100, so I am wondering is there anyway to push that left column down to match in the event the right column stretches, or is this something I am either A stuck with, or B need something other than CSS intervention to handlep

Negative 3496 pIn the following code, output is a string of lines each 804 characters long including a new line character at the end of each line. At position 454 in each line there is a Y.

I had the script email me the contents of output, and it contained the Y. But when I look at the file that is created and Ive confirmed its being created anew each time I run the script, instead of a Y there is a blank space. Ive looked at the file on the filesystem using cat and also as a web download opened in Notepad, and the Y just isnt there.p  pWhen the created file has two lines in it, it is 1608 bytes long, which makes sense since each line has 804.

Negative 3496 pIm wondering if I could get some opinions on whether this development project would be new and useful, or if it has already been done before.p  pIve been researching an idea that I have to create a premade solution for a Dynamic ServerSide Mobile Template solution. In my previous job I was tasked with maintaining multiple mobile clients, each of them having a custom UI skin. Normally this ends up requiring a lot of developer time when clients request UI changes or updates. My goal is to design a system that requires minimal developer input and allows designers complete control over the UI, includingp  ul liAbility to update content any timeli liVersion control push new template designs to client, rollback to previous versionsli liNo need for developer input for design changesli ul  pWhat Im brainstorming is a server side service module which is capable of providing templates on demand using RESTFul web services. The server would provide an HTML input function that would decompose any HTML page to a component tree. The component tree would then be saved to the database and displayed for confirmation amp editing.p  pThe server would be responsible forp  ul liDecomposing any HTML page into its template components ul li3rd party files such a JS, CSS referenced by pathli ulli liDisplaying HTML component tree for debuging and editing purposesli liSaving template component details in the database with versioningli liProviding template on demand via JSON or XML through RESTFul APIli ul  pThe client could be written using a hrefhttpmustache.github.com relnofollow titlemustachemustachea and easily ported to the various mobile devices using the various offshoots iOS, Android, etc. This thin client would simply send a request to the configured URI designated by the server. The URI would return all template information using mustache syntax, and this would be used to dynamically build the UI on demand. The client could also save the UI configuration and reload only when a new version is released.p  pTo summarize, the client would be responsible forp  ul liRequesting template data JSON or XML from predefined URLli liRendering template using mustache, assuming version not already saved.li ul  pI would love to start this as an open source project if the demand or need is there, and Im not reinventing the wheel. So far Ive found similar concepts but none seem to be fully dynamic.p

Im evidently missing some generics understanding.p  pNow if I dont use the general method at all and try to solve it this wayp  precode    public static void checkListltSomeTypegt list ...      public static void checkListltSomeOtherTypegt list ... codepre  pCompiler error  Method checkList has the same erasure checkList as another method...p  pSo is there any elegant solution for this I could just use different method names but would like to know how its possible without that.p  pThanksp
Negative 3496 pAs part of a project for my IT Seminar class, we have all been assigned to create different parts of a text analytic tool. There are several of us working on each part and we are able to collaborate if needed. p  pWe are required to build the frontend in Excel and for my specific part I need to access public company information from Facebook. It was suggested to use the Facebook API for this task. The company name would be listed in a single cell and the branchfinding must be automated. p  pHere is the description of what I need to accomplish with this script p  pOutput all facebook handles page IDs for all branches of the company  e.g. Hilton, New York, Hilton New York Fashion District, etc... For the Applebees example you would find the facebook handles for all branches locations for Applebees.  These can often be found through brand name matching wildcard Hilton  or through downloading the list of the likes for the parent company.  Append additional data columns with additional branch information e.g. number of likes, number talking about this, number that were here.  Append timestamp at top of sheet so the data gathering time is known.p  pI dont have any experience with the FacebookAPI or FQL so any help in getting started would be much appreciated. I have some knowledge of VBA and PHP. p

Negative 3496 pI have my program set up to allow the user to select a station, then pick between 2 dates, then they pick what shift they want. They can pick Both, First, or Second.

I think my program returns no values for second shift because not all values between 16 and 3 are greater then start and less then end. For example 600PM is not less than end hour of 3 so it is not included in output. How do I achieve this Here is my codep  precodeDECLARE StartHour INT DECLARE EndHour INT SET StartHour  CASE TimeRange   WHEN 0 THEN 0 Start of Overall WHEN 1 THEN 6 1st Shif Start WHEN 2 THEN 16 2nd Shift Start END  SET EndHour  CASE TimeRange    WHEN 0 THEN 24 End of Overall WHEN 1 THEN 16 End of First Shift WHEN 2 THEN 3 End of Second Shift END  SELECT Testerline1CycleTimes.Station, Testerline1CycleTimes.StationEntry  WHERE Testerline1CycleTimes.Station LIKE Station AND Testerline1CycleTimes.StationEntry Between Start And End AND DATEPART hh , Testerline1CycleTimes.StationEntry  gt StartHour AND DATEPART hh , Testerline1CycleTimes.StationEntry  lt EndHour codepre

Negative 3496 pIm currently working on a project transferring 50 groups of Excel Charts to a powerpoint presentation. I have 50 items that Im comparing and making 50 identical charts. The way that I have it set up in my excel workbook is that the chart is always the same chart ie Chart 2, but by changing a unique ID number, my chart will source from a different area of the worksheet. p  pIn the usual case, I would just copy and paste the chart as a picture. p  pHowever, in my case, I also need to get rid of all data labels lt10. I have found a code to do delete lt10 datalabels in Powerpoint, but not excel. In order to execute this code, I have to keep the object in chart format. Unfortunately, because of how I have set up my  charts to be the same chart that can source different data, whenever I change a unique ID number to copy a new chart, my previous charts already copied into Powerpoint update themselves and look like the information is sourced from the latest item. p  pMy options right now are 1 Copying and Pasting each item one at a time, running my Data label code on Powerpoint, and then converting everything in that slide into a Picture. This is tedious.  2 Figuring out how to edit Data labels within Excel, and then copying and pasting as an image 3 MOST IDEAL copy and paste an unlinked chart from Excel to PPT. This allows me to run my Powerpoint lt10 formatting code, but the unlinking also allows me to change my excel sheet without messing up my current charts. p  pDoes anyone have a clue on how to copy and paste an unlinked chart from Excel to PPT that is NOT a Picture p

Nevermind that, the error happens for this code too.p  pHeres what happens if I put breakpoint in the success part of the first ajax call and when I debug in Chrome, eveything works fine. Heres what I mean by working fine after the method goes in the first success, I want some divs to be hidden and  the message I get as a result from the ajax call to be shown. The second time the first success is entered, another string will be ADDED to the previous. In the end, when the second success part is entered, that message is hidden and Im showing some data.p  pAnd this is what happens everything is fine until MyMethod is called. When it gets called, the browser stops working. If I press my left mouse key, nothing happens. When MyMethod is called for the last time, the browser works fine, I get quick glimpse of the message and then it shows the data from the second ajax call. And the message that I see shortly is the whole message, from all the calls to MyMethod, which shouldnt happen.p  pI want it to be shown for the entire for loop and before the Finish method. And it shouldnt be the same message. It should get bigger with every ajax call to MyMethod.p

Negative 3496 pSo what Im trying to do, is make a nice scroll bar, using a Kinetic Model.  The issue is dampening on overshoot.  The behavior I want to show is that when you overshoot Go past the maxminimum, it dampening the positioning.p  pThe specific behavior I want is this So say, the Maximumum Overshoot is 50 pixels. Heres a table representing how Id like it to work.  This is the best way, I can think of, to present it.p  precodeDisplacement       Position it  Percent  of position        Displays    Overshot Over      25                12.5        50     100               25          100     200               37.5        200     400               43.75       400     ...                ...          ...  Note Decimals would obviously round down so we can actually display it. codepre  pIm pretty sure I can calculate this recursively but I dont want to do that.  I think the mathematical relationship is fairly obvious, although Im not exactly sure how to do it.  strongI may even be thinking of this the wrong way,so please consider disregarding my chart.strong The strongimportantstrong thing is that the stronguser cant move the window past the max overshoot valuestrong In this case, 50 pixels.p  pHeres a segment the of code running the positioning setting...p  precodefunction KineticModelSetPositionNewPosition      Sets the position of the kinetic model. Using this, itll calculate velocity.       local CurrentTime  tick     local ElapsedTime  CurrentTime  self.TimeStamp     local LocalVelocity  self.Position  self.LastPosition  5  ElapsedTime      TimeStamp  CurrentTime     selfSetVelocity0.2  self.Velocity  0.8  LocalVelocity  20 previous velocity maintained, 80 of new velocity used.      if NewPosition gt self.Maximum then         print[KineticModel]  Past Max Manual         local Displacement  math.absNewPosition  self.Maximum          Dampen position so it cant go over.           self.Position  self.Maximum  Displacement  self.MaxBounce  This doesnt work.      elseif NewPosition lt self.Minimum         print[KineticModel]  Past Min Manual         local Displacement  math.absNewPosition  self.Minimum          Same displacement here     else         self.Position  NewPosition     end      self.LastPosition  self.Position     self.OnPositionChangeself.Position     print[KineticModel]  Set Velocity  ..self.Velocity.. Local Velocity  ..LocalVelocity  end codepre  pThe main issue is trying to find a mathematical way to find the displacement I should display it at.  Ill be implementing this displacement to basically filter out the position before its set at every point, so if theres a potential problem with that, please tell me.p  pThanks.

Negative 3496 pIve dug around for about half an hour trying to find a way to do this, but Im far from good with regex and ... well, am giving up.  I turn to my peers for some help.p  pIve got a large text file that has a bunch of xml like values in it and I need to completely remove the entries.p  pAll the entries start with, for example, codeltjunktag gtcode Important to note the asterisk I think, because its an operator in regex, and end with codeltjunktaggtcode.p  pFor example  Find all instances of this except the text in the middle differs between entries, and delete it out of the file.p  precodeltjunktag gt randomgibberishyes randomgibbereseno ltjunktaggt codepre  pIve triedp  precodeltjunktag gtltjunktaggt codepre  pBut that doesnt seem to be working right.

Negative 3496 pIm trying to make an app that animates the mouth on a persons face, much like jibjab.com, example can be found a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvz8QsRdV7SYampt0m20s relnofollowstrongherestronga. In order to do this, I had a layer of all black as the bottom most layer, followed by a layer of the face with the mouthchin region cropped out, and finally a layer of just the mouthchin at the top.  As I moved the mouthchin layer down, the cropped region of layer 2 was exposed, giving the effect of an open mouth. Code can be found stronga hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16556824caanimationwithcalayersoccasionallycreatesflickeredanimationvideoinclud16627620comment2394492416627620hereastrongp  pHowever, the animation occasionally flickers, and from looking at other SO questions, it sounds like a hardware limitation caused by the layer with the mouth cropped out. p  pThe only alternate approach I can come up with is to manually animate the black mouth region instead of having it done implicitly by the displacement of the mouth layer. I would do this by creating 3 layers 1 with the entire image, 1 with the mouthchin, and one for the black inner mouth region. I would animate the mouthchin layer as before, but use a CGPath for the black inner mouth region and use an NSTimer to update the path every x seconds so that it moves in unison with the mouthchin layer animation.p  pDoes anyone have any alternative approaches, or a solution to my first problemp

Negative 3496 pIm working my way through SICP, and have been reading Code Complete a bit. In Code Complete, I learnt to abstract and structure things as much as possible. In SICP, I learnt to create helper functions for every task that could possibly be abstracted into one. Anyway, my problem I have a class A, that should be able to do task b, task c, and task d. So I create 3 methods, b, c, and d. The tasks that each of those methods have to do are reasonably complex, but fit with the level of abstraction my class and other code providese.g. the class abstracts database access, and rather than having codeA.findEmployeeStevecode return a list or other lowlevel datatype, it returns an Employee instance. The findEmployee method can and should, in my opinion be divided in different parts as well. It could for example call two functions, codefetchEmployeeDataStevecode, and codereturnEmployeeInstanceemployeedatacode. But just putting all those functions in a class, like thisp  precodeclass EmployeeDBobject   def findEmployeeself,name     employeedataself.fetchEmployeeDataname     employeeinstanceself.returnEmployeeInstanceemployeedata     return employeeinstance   def fetchEmployeeDataself,name     pass   def returnEmployeeInstanceself,employeedata     pass codepre  pmakes it much less structured, and doesnt really help improve cohesion. What is an appropriate way to structure my code, in cases such as thisp  pThanks for your time.p  pEDIT I just realised I could do it like thisp  precodeclass EmployeeDBobject   def findEmployeeself,name     def fetchEmployeeDataname       pass     def returnEmployeeInstanceemployeedata       pass      employeedatafetchEmployeeDataname     employeeinstancereturnEmployeeInstanceemployeedata     return employeeinstance codepre  pIt hides the subfunctions nicely, and looks rather nice, but I only very seldom see this in any code, so Im not sure if thats the right way to go.

Negative 3496 pI have a djangorestframework REST API with hierarchical resources. I want to be able to create subobjects by POSTing to codev1objectsltpkgtsubobjectscode and have it automatically set the foreign key on the new subobject to the codepkcode kwarg from the URL without having to put it in the payload. Currently, the serializer is causing a 400 error, because it expects the codeobjectcode foreign key to be in the payload, but it shouldnt be considered optional either. The URL of the subobjects is codev1subobjectsltpkgtcode since the key of the parent isnt necessary to identify it, so it is still required if I want to codePUTcode an existing resource.p  pShould I just make it so that you POST to codev1subobjectscode with the parent in the payload to add subobjects, or is there a clean way to pass the codepkcode kwarg from the URL to the serializer Im using codeHyperlinkedModelSerializercode and codeModelViewSetcode as my respective base classes. Is there some recommended way of doing this So far the only idea I had was to completely reimplement the ViewSets and make a custom Serializer class whose getdefaultfields comes from a dictionary that is passed in from the ViewSet, populated by its kwargs. This seems quite involved for something that I would have thought is completely runofthemill, so I cant help but think Im missing something. Every REST API  Ive ever seen that has writable endpoints has this kind of URLbased argument inference, so the fact that djangorestframework doesnt seem to be able to do it at all seems strange.p

The reason for this is on a fresh page reload I am technically not loggged in but I may have a token stored in a cookie. i would like to validate this token against a rest service. Problem is that I need it to block.p  pIf a timeout occurs or if its not valid that i can treat teh user as not authenticated.p  pThis is the reason for wanting to block is that i would like to redirect them using location.path to a new URL it not a valid token.p  pThis doesnt happen on a specific route so i cant use resolve which is blocking. It technically happens on every route  I use the on.routeChangeStart and check an internal variable got LoggedIn or not, if not logged in i check for the stored token.p  pThis happens on each Page refresh but not while navigating inside the application.p  pThe affect I am trying to get is how Gmail works.p  pLook forward to any insight anyone has on this p  pThanksp

Negative 3496 pIve converted my project to a minimum SDK 6, and switched to using the base localization.  I am in the USA so using English as my base, so I do not have the storyboard translated to en.  The storyboard is in the Base.lproj folder.  There is a .strings file in all of the language folders except English.p  pI want to confirm that I dont shouldnt have a translation for the language I use.  Correctp  pBut my real question is, how do the .strings files in the other language files get created  The translators at my company want the English version for they to use in their tools, so I will send them the Localizable.strings from Base, but do I need to run ibtool to extract the strings from the storyboard  I want to make sure Im following the best practices, and to make sure Im being efficient and not doing too many extra unnecessary steps.p

Negative 3496 pWe are developing a web based Internet application that is required to work in the Smartphones basically iOS and Android platformsp  pThe CSS and JS that we use does not have a specific feature to handle orientation.  The problem that we are facing is that, screen resizing is happening properly in iPhone in all versions, whereas in most of the Android devices, the resizing from Landscape to Portrait is not happening.  In other words, when we rotate the device from Landscape to Portrait, the automatic adjusting of the screen is not happening. But, the resizing is proper when we rotate the device from Portrait to Landscape.p  pThe strange behavior we observed is that, when we used plain HTMLs without the Frame, the resizing is proper. The problem occurs only when we load the HTML using the Frame.p  pAs our code is tightly coupled with frames, we can not remove it. Kindly help us to resolve this issue.p

Negative 3496 pI am working on a system that utilizes an Akka cluster. The dilemma that I am facing is how to update data on entry points. I have the following structurep  blockquote   p[Load Balancer]  [Entry Point]spray powered  [Workers]p blockquote  pOn the entry point I need to keep a list of users that are allowed to access data, in other words I need to keep a list with, lets say emails. However this list has to be updated frequently when new users are authorized or removed.p  pWhat would be the best approach to tackle this problem I was thinking about just switching this container of emailsIDs to a mutable one, but then the question is whether the system will lock this data on event processing and how this affects performance.p  pAny recommendations would be greatp  pUpdate  distribution of a new user will be done via a regular spray rest request. From the outside authorized for such system requests request will be made with security keys and a user ID to be added to the list  there are multiple nodes, each has spray rest entry point  speed doesnt matter as long as it is a couple seconds  order doesnt matter.p  pThe system will just a get a message on load balancer that it has to add one more ID to the list of users. Because of load balancer it will end up on one of the entry point spray nodes. It has to update its own list of IDs and also broad cast to all other entry points in the appbasically all from the load balancer list the required update.p  pHope this clarifies better.p

Negative 3496 pIve got a Rails app where users can create notebooks and share them with other users. Users can edit everything about their own notebooks, but only parts of notebooks shared with them.

Negative 3496 pIs there any way of programmatically getting the value of a Text Symbol at runtimep  pThe scenario is that I have a simple report that calls a function module. I receive an exported parameter in variable codeLVMSGcode of type codeCHAR1code. This indicates a certain status message created in the program, for instance codeFcode Fail, codeXcode Match or codeEcode Error. I currently use a codeCASEcode statement to switch on codeLVMSGcode and fill another variable with a short description of the message. These descriptions are maintained as text symbols that I retrieve at compile time with codetextMScode where  is the same as the possible returns of codeLVMSGcode, for instance codetextMSXcode has the value Exact Match Found.p  pNow it seems to me that the entire codeCASEcode statement is unnecessary as I could just assign to my description variable the value of the text symbol with ID codeMS  LVMSGcode pseudocode, would use codeCONCATENATEcode. Now my issue is how I can find a text symbol based on the String representation of its ID at runtime. Is this even possiblep  pIf it is, my code would look cleaner and I wouldnt have to update my actual code when new messages are added in the function module, as I would simply have to add a new text symbol. But would this approach  be any faster or would it in fact degrade the reports performancep

Negative 3496 pHope you all to be well. I have two questions. 1 in my deep network, my desired target output is [1,0] for class1 and [0,1] for class2. However after thousands of epochs 2000, 3000 it comes to MSE of 0.234 optimal and than it almost stays there after exceeding 3000 epochs. the final output neurons stays at [0.498,0.5123] for both the classes. and above that it can not go towards [1,0] for class 1 and [0,1] for class 2. What should i do to improve the training result. 2 i used random weights between 2 and 2, 0.2 and 0.2, and some other fixed weights assigned by me manually. But even than it results and stops at almost same situation.  Any suggestion in order to improve my results... Thank you in advance....p

Negative 3496 pHere is my problem p  pA student has decided to celebrate the start of Thanksgiving  break a tad early by getting a bit smashed.p  pHer home is at corner 0 on Main Street, and the Jail is at corner 10 on Main  Street.

Negative 3496 pIm using Azure Media Services to encode adaptive videos that need to be seen in web Im using Smooth Streaming for this and in both iOS and Android and Im using HLS for both. In the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsazurejj129582.aspxH264Encoding relnofollowAzure documentationa are presets for encoding to Smooth Streaming in 1080p and theres also a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsazurehh973635.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa for remuxing the SS files to HLS. So far, so good.br The problem is that when I convert the 1080p Smooth Streaming to HLS, the result is not playable in Android. Ive searched about it and it seems that the problem is that the Media Services preset encodes the video using h264 high profile and Android doesnt support that profile.br Ive fixed this problem encoding to two different Smooth Streaming presets H264 Smooth Streaming 1080p and H264 Smooth Streaming 720p because the latter encodes to h264 main profile, and then using the 720p files to generate the HLS video. This is not optimal because Im encoding one more time that needed and Im not using the 720p smooth streaming files. So... Is there a way that I can skip the 720p Smooth Streaming encoding Maybe encoding to Smooth Streaming in 1080p but with main profilep

Negative 3496 pAfter another terrible bug hunt, I am wondering the following Is it possible to add some extra information to all exceptions, for example the name of an object.  This would increase the readability of the errors a lot and make looking for bugs or input errors a lot quicker. This is especially the case if one has many objects which are from the same class and therefore share much code, but have different attributes. In this case it can be very useful if the error message also states the name of the object in the error.p  pA simplfied example I am trying to simulate different types of facilities, a pig farm and a cow farm. These are the same class, but do have different attributes. In the simulation many facilities are made and if an exception is raised, it would be very helpful if the name of the object is added to the exception.p  precodeclass facility     def initself, name         self.name  name         self.animals  []  farms  [] farms.appendfacilitycowfarm farms.appendfacilitypigfarm print farms[0].stock codepre  pThis would yieldp  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt AttributeError facility instance has no attribute stock codepre  pBut I would like to add the name of the facilityp  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt AttributeError facility instance has no attribute stock   Name of object cowfarm codepre  pI tried something likep  precodedef printnameexception     try         print self.name     except AttributeError         pass     raise exception  printname Exception codepre  pBut that doesnt work.

Negative 3496 pI have an app that I am creating that will eventually, be a countdown timer with multiple stores of times so that the user will select the one to use and then start the countdowntimer. The issue that I am having is that the call to the codecountDownTimer.startcode works but the timer jumps to the codeonfinishcode. I placed log.is within the override onTick function and those Log.is did not appear in logcat, which leads me to believe that something went wrong in the logic and that the countdowntimer method did not see something to count down and dropped to the onfinish.p  pThat being said, please see the entire app belowp  precode    package com.vertygoeclypse.multitimer     import android.app.Activity

Negative 3496 pI work for a digital signage company where we send lots of animationsvideos to various machines on the network. We have used ftp in the past to send files from a server app which is our content management system to machines that play the content.p  pIs it possible to use RabbitMQ in such an environment where we are sending large files some videos may be a gigabyte or more in size Most files will be really small but occasionally we will send large videos.p  pAlso some of the player machines will be added later which means that the queuing has to be dynamic i.e. player added so now we can send content to it. Can RabbitMQ be configured in this way from the demos I have seen you have to create the queues up front before the server and client applications launch.p  pAlso can we secure the sending of files so that the sending app has to log in before sending contents to a machine like login for FTPp

Negative 3496 pi have a list of indices that i want to use to calculate a mean of a fix number of rows starting from my index. Ideally, i would find a way to do this for several columns at the same time.p  pMy list of indices looks something like thisp  precodea  seq1,100,10 codepre  pMy data frame is similar top  precodedfltdata.frameA 010, b1020, c  2030, d4050, e  seq0,100,10     A  b  c  d   e 1   0 10 20 40   0 2   1 11 21 41  10 3   2 12 22 42  20 4   3 13 23 43  30 5   4 14 24 44  40 6   5 15 25 45  50  etc... codepre  pWhat i would like would be a way, to get means out of this data frame, for all columns in a manner likep  precodecolnames  cA, b, c      meansdf[a4a, colnames] codepre  pNow obviously that doesnt work, but i hope it illustrates my idea. I want a mean of the last 5 entrys counting backwards from codeacode.p  pNow i have tried with the codeforeachcode package probably wrongly so and if i usep  precodelibraryforeach test lt foreachi  a do meandf[i4i,A] codepre  pi get a working result, which is a list with the means i want, but only for column A. If i instead usep  precodetest lt foreachi  a, j  colnames do meandf[i4i,j] codepre  pi somehow only get one value per column.p  pI have looked into solutions with codesapply and tapplycode but i am either too stupid to understand how to use those iteratively for parts of a column or they are just not made for that.p  pLastly people regularly come up with codedata.tablecode, but i quite honestly have no idea how the syntax works in this case. I know thatp  precodeDT lt as.data.tabledf DT[,meanA[a4a]] codepre  preturnsp  precodenumerical expression has 10 elements only the first used codepre  pwhich was the problem in the first place with codemeancode. If i try to use my colnames parameter, it gets even worsep  precodeDT[,meancolnames[a4a], with  FALSE] argument is not numeric or logical returning NA codepre  pI am sorry if I am posting an obvious question, but hours of search here and elsewhere on the internet and in R reference documents and the documentation have left me with the feeling that this is not that easy.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  pP.S. Should it help in any way, codeacode is derived from evaluating other parts of the dataframe like codea  whichthetruth amp nothingbutcode and could if necessary also be used as logical. I just think i have more overview with this construction.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI wanted a subset of data in both column as in several rows defined by a list.

Negative 3496 pI was given a huge Microsoft Visual C 2003 project that generates an executable .exe where the project itself is depending on several DLLs. I noticed that even if the code managed to compile, when it runs it will look for the DLLs that it depends on say my program is called abc and the DLLs it depends on is called def.dll, and even if I add the path to include in the project settings, it will complain saying the DLL could not be found unless I add the folders containing def.dll to the PATH variable.p  pAs such, the final product is not one exe but one exe with tonnes of DLL.p  pIs it possible to have everything compiled to one single .exe file so that I can just take this executable with me and it would run on every single PC that I have The project itself is massive so I dont plan to change every single .h and .cpp file, but if there is a quick settings change in the visual C I think it would be nice. I know potentially the .exe would be 10 times as large and compiling it would probably take hours, but I think portability is rather important here.p  pThanksp  pPS NOT sure why people are voting down this post...can I no longer ask legitimate questions on StackOverflow I know the problem may sounds trivial to some of you guys, but I was really just simplifying the problem for the sake of illustration. p

However, what I am concerned about is the following. Going back to the first example above, if we try asking for codeattrtestInstance, testAttributecode, we see from the global environment that it is code1codep  pPresumably, the code.selfcode that is used in the methods of the reference class object is stored in the same memory location as codetestInstancecodeit is the same object. Thus, by setting an attribute on codetestInstancecode successfully in the global environment, but not as a code.selfcode reference as demonstrated in the first example, have we inadvertently triggered a copy of the entire object in the global environment Or is the way attributes are stored funny in some way that the object can reside in the same memory, but its attributes are different depending on the calling environmentp  pI see no other explanation for why codeattr.self, testAttributecode is codeNULLcode but codeattrtestInstance, testAttributecode is code1code. The embindingem code.selfcode is locked once and for all, but that does not mean the emobjectem it references cannot change. If this is the desired behavior, it seems like a gotcha.p  pA final question is whether or not the preceding results imply codeattrltcode should be avoided on reference class objects, at least if the resulting attributes are used from within the objects methods.p
Negative 3496 pI would like to know what is the best setup to have an elasticsearch data node and kibana server on separate machines. I have setup multiple elasticsearch data nodes and would like to show all dashboards on one server but not sure how to do that. I do not want to have different urls to view different dashboards.

Thanksp  pmismasp  p[EDIT] I have decided not to use generic for this, as I think those 2 cents from Alex where for that. Instead I will do this copy logic in my business logic service layer POJO will remain stupid.br Although, I will make those two hibernate objects to implement common interface only getter methods of shared fields will be here. And finally, I will make a copy method on my business logic service layer and make it to take that interface parameter for copying fields.br Hope this will help someone.

Negative 3496 pIn Excel 2010 VBA, Im using the FileExists property of the FileSystemObject to check whether a file exists. On my computer it works fine.

In both cases, the file being checked is on the local hard drive.p  pIm checking for the file right after using Shell to unzip the file. I use DoEvents after the unzip.

Negative 3496 pIm a DjangoOpenLayers newbie, and Ive been following various tutorials, especially a hrefhttpscode.google.compgeodjangobasicappswikiFOSS4GWorkshop relnofollowthis onea. I use a view that calls a builtin GeoDjango template to render KML dynamically, which I try to pass to a page to render the map using OpenLayers. However, instead of producing a map showing all of the points from my KML file, all I get is the default map, the same as if I never added the kml layer in my map.html file. I suspect that somehow the KML file is not getting loaded into OpenLayers, but I simply dont understand why not, or how I can test whether the KML data loaded successfully.

Negative 3496 pI know this theorem. But how to prove it I divided this question into three situations. But I dont know how to analysis it when node v is grey. brAssume that there is an edge  in the BFS tree. Then, when u is in the queue a queue contains gray nodes only, the color of v has one of the three possibilities white, gray, and black. brIf v is the white, the edge  is a tree edge when u is the head of the queue and u explores all its neighboring nodes. brIf v is the black, node v and its neighboring including node u must have been visited. Since this is an undirected graph. The edge  is either a tree edge or a cross edge. p

Negative 3496 pCaches with Write Back Cache, perform write operations to the cache memory and return immediately. This is only when the data is already present in the cache. If the data is not present in the cache, it is first fetched from the lower memories, and then written in the cache.p  pI do not understand why it is important to first fetch the data from the memory, before writing it. If the data is to be written, it will become invalid anyways. p  pI do know the basic concept, but want to know the reason behind having to read data before writing to the address.p  pI have the following guess,p  pThis is done for Cache Coherency, in a multiprocessor environment. Other processors snoop on the bus to maintain Cache Coherency. The processor writing on the address needs to gain an exclusive access, and other processors must find out about this.  But, does that mean, this is not required on SingleProcessor computersp  pThanksp

Negative 3496 pI am trying to create a spring rest api, which should be accessible through web browser hence the attempted use of csrf. Do note I am also new to spring, and to web security.

Negative 3496 pI have another problem with read.table. The fill option says in case the rows have unequal length, blank fields are implicitly added. The problem is that the blank fields do not prevent R from forgetting that field. e.g. I have two lines, each with 4 columns, but in the second line one of the columns is empty. I want to read table this and insert a zero so that the number of colums stays fixed. Can you help me Thanks.p

Negative 3496 pIve just done a lightweight migration added an attribute, optional btw, created the new version  before etc. If I get it correctly, the menu item EditorCreate Managed object subclass should give me a bare bones model class containing the new attribute. When performing this,  I choose the new model version,  after that select the class to be generated,  select the right targets and the class that should be renewed I have to overwrite the existing class p  pand then nothing. The new attribute is not there in the created class. What might probably go wrong  or does it not that wayp

You have to be aware of the fact that each migration file is generated with a timestamp in the filename, which gives the files an order. The order of generation is also the order of migration operation when you fire the Artisan CLI command php artisan migrate. So, if a file asks for a foreign key constraint referring to a key which will be, but not yet, generated in a latter file, the Error 1215 is fired. In such case, what you have to do is adjust the order of migration files generation. Generate new files in proper order, copyin the content, then delete the disordered old files., strongposted by emuser2975399emstrong.p  pDue the fact that I am not able to add a comment to his post Ive created this post, where Ive added the solution. The problem, in my case, wasnt due of different type of attributes but the table creation order was the issue. p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  pTherefore in order to avoid this error firstly needs to be ran the Forward Engineer CtrlG, from Database menu with Skip creation of FOREIGN KEYS checked. Now youll have a database without foreign keys. Repeat the previous step, but with Skip creation of FOREIGN KEYS unchecked and the foreign keys will be added.p

Negative 3496 pI was at a job interview and the interviewer gave me a task I have an object called DBconn. that Object has 4 methodsp  p   connectParamsp  p   queryStringp  p   update Stringp  p   disconnectp  pMy mission was to implement that Database object DBconn in a singleton pattern  meaning the first person who create this object will get a new instance of it and from there one  every person will get that instance of the database not to create a new instance for every user  but share the same object.p  pI first tried to us the standard way of singleton where I create a DBconn object in the first time that a user called it   and return the instance from there on. The problem was that the connect method should only run for the first time meaning user1 connect, and then user 2 also connect  is not valid and if I return the database every user that want to harm to system can connect or disconnect as he please.p  pSo i decided to return the singleton class instead of the database object, and do the connect only for the first user. But then I encounter a different problem the query and update methods of the DBconn should work in multithread way meaning they are synchronized  according to DBconn implementation. But if I write them in a synchronized java method that will force the program to execute each of them separately because of the synchronized saved word and that will ignore the beauty multithreaded way that update and query work.p  pSo he gave me a homework task which off course included using the internet and consulting  to try and solve this problem by writing it in java.p  pthis is what I did so far I also tried to implement a very raw database which saves persons data but I still dont know how to make the update and query to 1. work in a muiltithread way. 2. work in a muiltithread way in the singleton class as wellp  pThanks for all of you who trying to helpp  pSingletonDB p  precode    public class SingletonDB          private static DBconnImpl db  null         private static

Negative 3496 pSummary Im new to Android development, and Im using Gabriele Mariottis excellent cardslib to display images .jpgs on cards.  I want the image to cover the entire card with no margin.  Instead, Im seeing an unwanted 12dp margin on all sides of the image.  Ive tried various things, but Ive been unable to remove this margin in other words, set the margin to 0dp.p  pDetails  Im displaying a .jpg on a card.  The .jpg is the only thing on the card that is, no header, no thumbnail, etc.  The problem is that extra whitespace appears on all sides of the card.  Depending on the relative aspect ratios of the .jpg and the card, there is more whitespace on either the topbottom or leftright edges, but at the minimum the whitespace is exactly 12dp.p  pLooking at the documentation, in particular the a hrefhttpsgithub.comgabrielemariotticardslibblobmasterdocCARD.md relnofollowCARD documentationa, it seemed I should set things like layoutmarginTop and layoutmarginBottom.  I tried a number of different permutations of these, but could not remove the 12dp margin.  My layouts currently look like thisp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutmargin0dp     androidlayoutmarginTop0dp     androidlayoutmarginBottom0dp     androidpaddingLeft0dp     androidpaddingRight0dp     androidpaddingTop0dp     androidpaddingBottom0dp gt      ltit.gmariotti.cardslib.library.view.CardViewNative         androidididcarddemo         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutmargin0dp         androidlayoutmarginTop0dp         androidlayoutmarginBottom0dp         androidpaddingLeft0dp         androidpaddingRight0dp         androidpaddingTop0dp         androidpaddingBottom0dp gt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pandp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutmarginTop0dp     androidlayoutmarginBottom0dp     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheight238dpgt      ltImageView         androidlayoutmarginTop0dp         androidlayoutmarginBottom0dp         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidididimageViewgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pI realize many of the above settings are redundant, unnecessary or silly.

Negative 3496 pI am building an artificial intelligence agent for an existing board game and having difficulty figuring out how to debug this Java code in Eclipse.p  pThe existing game consists of a server that is run and listens for client connection. Once two clients connect, the game is automatically run to completion based on the AI in the client.  I have source files for all elements.p  pI would like to be able to debug one of the clients so I can work on it.  The issue is that, if I simply run the server and connect the first client, then debug the second, Eclipse skips all breakpoints.  If I run the server as a remote debugging server, then run a remote debugging configuration on a client in Eclipse, I can step through the server code, but once its waiting for the second client to connect, it just stops.  At this point, I cant figure out how to connect the second client.p  pHow can I debug an application with this configuration A server, one connected client and my second client that I want debugging information for.p  pThank youp

Negative 3496 pI am using ASP.NET WebAPI with the built in authentication and identity services that come with the Visual Studio template. I now have it that a user can access the system and be authenticated.p  pThe next logical step is to allow the user to create records. Lets say the user can have a Project. How can I associate the user with a project at the point the project is created It seems logical that the project table will just store the userid provided by User.Identity.GetUserId.p  pNow, say that a project consists of Tasks. By default the WebAPI will create a Tasks controller, where I post a task. I think I would need to inject some additional information such as the project id at the point of creating the task. p  pBut, say someone wants to add a task a project that doesnt belong to them. I need to verify this by loading the project, and checking the userid field. Now I am adding two repositories to my controller. This seems like a lot of work.p  pIs it my own laziness that makes this seem hard p

Negative 3496 pI often use jslint and tools to verify my code for programming errors, etc...p  pDuring the course of my programming I often find that I need a local variable or a local function to do some simple things. So I go to my main single var statement at the top of my local scope and adjust it, sometimes breaking my creative flow. So sometimes instead I declare a single line var in the middle of my code to continue my programming and then move it at the top var statement during refactoring afterwards.p  pI had an idea today that i want to explore and did not find anything on it on Google or stackoverflow.p  pMy idea is this, just declare a single temp object and use it for whatever the need. Ex adding some attribute for a new variable or function. p  pSo instead of  p  precode if I omit the last comma, the next variable will be a global var variable1  Hello World,   variable2  Testing...    ... some code ... var variable3  42 codepre  pI would instead use p  precodevar temp   temp.variable1  Hello World temp.variable2  Testing...  ... some code ... temp.variable3  42 codepre  pSo I do not risk polluting the global namespace, I declare variable as needed and do not struggle with that var statement since I always know that a variable preceded by temp. is in the local scope.p  pAny comment or advice will be appreciated. p

Negative 3496 pOur organization has a VOIP multiplatform application to exchange Media over RTP Real time transport Protocol. p  pIn Linux, we have a Java Application UI which interacts with SDK Module written in C and C. This application opens UDP Socket port 3230 for Audio and 3232 for Video. p  pNow the above application is modified by removing the UI part in JAVA with a consoleCommand line interface using the Same SDK. p  pWhen Java application runs, audio and video ports are not blocked. But when the console application is executed, Audio Port 3230 gets blocked by UFW firewall. I can see this in Syslogs file, as i result i donot receive any audio packets even though wireshark shows them being received. p  pCommands Used 1. To check firewall status sudo ufw status  it says enabled 2. sudo ufw disable To disable the firewall Console application works if UFW is disabled but, our application should not run with root privileges.p  pWhat could be the reason that UFW decided to block port 3230 or any other number , only for Console application process and not for the Java application Processp  pIf it is blocked is there any command to unblock it or add an exception with root permissions requiredp  pThank you p
Negative 3496 pI am trying to solve this problemp  pPetar likes to play with numbers. He is very good with strings too. One day he decided to invent a new game of summing numbers. He will get one number and will try to divide it by 5, if the number can be divided without remainder for example 15 can be divided by 5 without remainder, but 17 divided by 5 is 3 with remainder 2 Petar will add this number to the sum. However if the number cannot be divided without remainder, only the remainder will be added to the sum. After he is done with the numbers, Petar likes to replace some of the sums digits with strings. If the sum is odd he will replace the last digit and all others that are the same as it with a given string. If the sum is even he will do the same, but with the first digit. For example, if the sum is 2434, and the string is a  the result will be a434. You will be given a start number, an end number and a string. You have to check all numbers between the start number and the end number without the end number, do Petars algorithm and finally replace the digits with the string as described above. p  pstrongInputstrongp  pThe input data should be read from the console. It consists of three lines    The first line will hold the starting number    The second  line will hold the end number    The third like will hold the replacement string The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.p  pMy current code looks like so, it compiles but when I input the values I get an error at line 49, I cannot use debug for some reason I get an error from VisualStudio, so can you please have a look at it for mep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Numerics   namespace PetarsGame      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      ulong startNum  ulong.ParseConsole.ReadLine             ulong endNum  ulong.ParseConsole.ReadLine             string replacementStr  Console.ReadLine             Listltulonggt list  new Listltulonggt             ulong sum  0             Listltstringgt sumStrArr  new Listltstringgt              for int i  0 startNum lt endNum startNum                              if startNum  5  0                                      list.AddstartNum                                  else                                      list.AddstartNum  5                                           foreach var item in list                              sum  item                           string sumStr  sum.ToString             foreach var item in sumStr                              sumStrArr.AddChar.ToStringitem                          if IsEvensum                              sumStrArr[0]  replacementStr                          if IsEvensum  false                              sumStrArr[sumStrArr.Capacity  1]  replacementStr                               public static bool IsEvenulong n                      if n  2  0                              return true                          else                              return false                             codepre

Negative 3496 pMy requirement was that whenever there was an error in the Jmeter execution, there should be a delay before starting the next iteration.p  pStart Next Thread Loop is selected at the Thread Group level for Sampler error. Due to this Jmeter will start a new Iteration if there is any error during the execution.p  pFor this purpose I have used Beanshell Timer at the start of the Iteration. Following code is added for delay if the response code is anything other than 200p  precodeString code  prev.getResponseCode ifcode200 log.infoResponse Code  code log.infosleep for 10sec  return 10000  else  return 0 codepre  pPlease let me know if there are any better ways of doing this.p  pI believe the prev.getResponseCode can also be used to do any kind of cleanup task, in case there is any error.p  pLike for example, if a user logs into the application and got an error before doing logout. We can test at the start of the iteration if the previous response code is in error, if so, we can make the user logout of the application.p

Negative 3496 pMy application is supposed to have the user enter latitude and longitude values and a MapActivity opens centered around those coordinates with a circle drawn over the area. For some reason, no matter what coordinate pair is sent to the MapActivity, he map is always centered around a point in the middle of the ocean near Africa.p  pThis function of the application used to work just fine until recently, but the other function of the app works just fine. The user can also select a location to center the map around, and the code is essentially the same, except the latitude and longitude values that are put into the bundle for the MapActivity are hardcoded instead of being entered by the user.p  pWhats even more confusing is that the MapActivity receives the values that user enters just fine, but it just doesnt move to that location. I used codelogcatcode to make sure the MapActivity was getting the correct values.p  pI am currently using codeAndroid Studio version 1.2.1.1codep  pHere is the Map Activity code edited to contain all of the codep  precodeprivate GoogleMap mMap  Might be null if Google Play services APK is not available. private LocationRequest mLocationRequest private GoogleApiClient mGoogleApiClient private Location mCurrentLocation private double targetLat private double targetLon private double latRandom private double lonRandom private int radius private int circleState   Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymap     Bundle b  getIntent.getExtras     targetLat  b.getDoublelat     targetLon  b.getDoublelon     Log.iMapActivity,targetLat  targetLat     Log.iMapActivity,targetLon  targetLon     radius  getIntent.getExtras.getIntrad     setUpMapIfNeeded      mGoogleApiClient  new GoogleApiClient.Builderthis             .addApiLocationServices.API             .addConnectionCallbacksthis             .addOnConnectionFailedListenerthis             .build     Override protected void onResume      super.onResume     setUpMapIfNeeded      Sets up the map if it is possible to do so i.e., the Google Play services APK is correctly   installed and the map has not already been instantiated..

Negative 3496 ol lipI have a Restful example which uses strongSpring Securitystrong and strongOAuth2strong and it works well. Basically, I can get an codeaccesstokencode and use that codeaccesstokencode to access protected resources. Similar example here a hrefhttpwww.beingjavaguys.com201410springsecurityoauth2integration.html relnofollowSecuring Restful Web Services with Spring Security and OAuthapli lipI have changed that example by adding codecustomUserAuthenticationProvidercode to authenticate against strongMysqlstrong via strongHibernatestrong.

Every thing works fine. Every time I log in there will be a row added to codeoauthaccesstokencode table I can use MySQL workbench to view blob column token. I can use this access token to access protected source without any issues.pli lipNow, I run 2 instances of Jetty each has its own port, i.e strong8080strong and strong8888strong. Each instance has identical war file. I login on the first instance to get the codeaccesstokencode and after that I use this accesstoken to access protected resource from the second instance. However, it always return code401 error Invalid access tokencode. pli ol  pIf I use this codeaccesstokencode to access resource in the first instance it run well. p  pAnother weird observation is that if I try to access resource from the second instance, codeaccesstokencode in the codeoauthaccesstokencode will be deleted.

Negative 3496 pI want to differentiate an expression and generate Fortran for the result. The expression is similar to codeatdiffx2fx,yy2gx,y,y,xycode. The result contains terms such as codeatdifffx,y,y,xy and atdiffgx,y,y,xycode. p  pBefore I generate Fortran I want to remove the atfunctions I have another script to convert the codedifffx,y,ycode and codediffgx,y,ycode entities to subroutine calls. Hence I am trying to write a function that goes through the expression tree and does something special when the atfunction is found. However, if I compare pieceat, this always evaluates to false whereas if I compare piecesin, the sin function is detected correctly.

Negative 3496 pHere is another one.p  pDoes anyone have any pointers for how to make a strongphotorealistic renderingstrong engine and image exporter in .NET What the end user would do is to import an object, assign colours, materials, push the render button, wait a bit and export the image at 300 dpi, 2048x2048 px. Is it even possiblep  pMaybe use a open source rendering engine, make an external rendering application with preset scene lighting, standard materials and pass arguments via args.p  pstrongOr the second optionstrong we have the renderings ready and we need to assemble them together. This option is significantly easier to implement, but the problem here is that in case we have a larger object that has other items pinned along its main surface  the camera sees the most left and most right element differently as the object directly below it.p  pSo if I place the same image along the main surface, the end result is not what you would want. So this option probably isnt the way to go.p  pstrongThe third optionstrong was to build a web service with a simple interface and render the image on server side and send the end image after render completes via dropbox or other cloud service. But I think this would be an overkill.p  pAnything would be great at this point. Thanksp

Total refers to the total number of incidents with that combination of rider and horse. What I would like is a table with the top 2 HorseIDs in terms of total for each rider, deduplicated. ie. the top horse for rider 1 was horse 5, as they have had 150 incidents together, compared with 20 and 2 for the other horses with rider 1. So what I would like as output here isp  precodeHorseID 5 600 30 codepre  pNote when there is less than 2 horses for a rider, it should just grab the top 1 instead. When it comes to rider 3, there is a draw so it picks the top 2 in terms of order  however, these are already on the list so are not added the deduplicate part  also happy to deduplicate afterward in a separate step if thats faster. I wouldnt mind if this instead grabbed number 34 in a draw so we had an extra horseid on the list, any method of resolving draws is fine.p  pThis is a toy dataset, the real dataset is much bigger and I will be grabbing the top 200 for each RiderID, so a scaleableefficient solution would be great.p  pHow would I go about thisp

It would check if a number from the current array is in the new array, if yes, it will just add any duplicate duration to the current duration. if no, it would add a new element to the NewNumber array and add an element to the NewDuration array.p  precodepublic static int findString[] list, int size, int start, String target      int pos  start      while pos lt size ampamp target.equalslist[pos]          pos           if pos  size         pos  1      return pos  codepre  pThis find method would be used to check if a phone number has already been placed in the new arrays, and if so, to determine where that number is.p  pFor example, if the array containsp  precode    phoneNumbers[0]  8885550000     callDurations[0]  10     phoneNumbers[1]  8885551234     callDurations[1]  26     phoneNumbers[2]  8885551234     callDurations[2]  2 codepre  pprinting calls details for 8885551234 would look likep  precode    all calls from  Calls from 8885551234 8885551234 duration 26s 8885551234 duration 2s codepre  pthe output for the new method instead should be26s 2sp  precode    all calls from  Calls from 8885551234 8885551234 duration 28s codepre  pI tried to solve it with this code but its giving a wrong outputp  precodepublic static void totalDurationsString[] phoneNumbers, int[] callDuration, int size, String target      String[] NewNumbers     int[] NewDuration     int pos      NewNumbers  new String[phoneNumbers.length]     NewDuration  new int[callDuration.length]     pos  findphoneNumbers,size, 0,target     whilepos lt size ampamp target.equalsphoneNumbers[pos]          NewNumbers[pos]  phoneNumbers[pos]         NewDuration[pos]  callDuration[pos]         System.out.printlnNewNumbers[pos]  duration  NewDuration[pos] s        codepre  pNOTRELATED The code I use to get all my details for each call is my method findAllCallsp  precodepublic static void findAllCallsString[] phoneNumbers, int[] callDurations, int size, String targetNumber      int matchPos      System.out.printlnCalls from   targetNumber       matchPos  findphoneNumbers, size, 0, targetNumber     while matchPos gt 0          System.out.printlnphoneNumbers[matchPos]   duration   callDurations[matchPos]  s           matchPos  findphoneNumbers, size, matchPos  1, targetNumber        System.out.printlnn all calls from      findAllCallsphoneNumbers,callDurations,size,8885551234 codepre  pAny correction would be much appreciated in advance.p
