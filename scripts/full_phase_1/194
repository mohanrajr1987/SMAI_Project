Positive 194 pI have a stored proc in a package that is erroring out with ORA00942 table or view does not exist error.  I have narrowed it to the following line in the WHERE clause which is causing the error WHERE HO.num IN SELECT  FROM TABLETOTABLEinhomeoffnumber  p  pThe function TOTABLE and the stored proc calling the function are in the same package. And if I hardcode a value like 123 or   for the parameter inhomeoffnumber it returns the results without any error. Also inhomeoffnumber is an optional parameter in the proc. Verified the TOTABLE function and this is not causing the issue as the same function is being used in another procedure which is working fine.So for some reason the inhomeoffnumber is getting lost when it is passed into the query. Nothing has changed in the package recently and suddenly I see this error when executed and confused about what is causing this issue.p

Negative 194 pOur installer is written with InnoSetup and we are actually quite happy with it.

We have already gone to some lengths to make the installer deal really well with automated and unattended installations by extending InnoSetups LOADINFmechanism with our own options.p  pIn order to satisfy the customers asking for MSI, I had been thinking about simply wrapping our regular installer inside an MSI, possibly created using WIX. The question is can I maintain the high configurability which our current installer offers that way How would I go about exposing the InnoInstallers options through the outer MSI in the unattendedmass installation scenariop  pNote that I havent really gotten to the point of actually digging into MSIcreation and WIX myself yet. Right now Im only interested in whether people who do know what theyre talking about think this would be a feasiblesensible approach to invest our energy in in the first place...p  p[EDIT] Initially I thought I could do with the temp extraction and execution approach, i.e. the MSI would simply serve as a vessel for delivering the Inno installer to the target PC and executing it there in VERYSILENTmode.

Negative 194 pWe have a set of assemblies which implement web services operations.p  pTo build the client proxies, we first build and deploy the web services assemblies and ASMX files on the server.p  pThen we use wsdl.exe to point to the ASMX endpoints and generate the classes for the client proxies.p  pIve seen that it is possible to create the proxies from wsdl files instead of asmx endpoints using wsdl.exe or disco.exe.p  hr  pstrongIs there a tool to generate wsdl files or proxy classes directly from the server assemblies without the need to use a web serverstrongp  hr  pUPDATEp  pFirst I would like to say I appreciate you guys taking the time to put into this. I also would like to say that I know how hard it is to give advice without knowing all the details of a given scenario. That said, let me detail more the scenario and address some points you guys made p  p1 This is a somewhat large project that has been in development for over a couple of years now. The decision to use ASMX web services was made before the existence of WCF.p  p2 I already thought about writing our own proxy generator and that may be an option if we dont find a tool that does it. p  p3 We still want to bind to the WSDL contract. What Im trying to avoid is having a dependency on a web server during the build process. p  p4 We already autogenerate the proxies in our automated build which runs in TFS Build and that has not been an issue per se. The issue, as I was told, is having to split the build in two parts server amp client. There may be alternatives to avoid the split using some fancy MSBUILD task, but my knowledge on that matter is limited.p  p5 I do expect the build to brake on TFS Build if the client side code and server side code dont match during compilation. That should have been addressed on the developers machine before checkin.p  p6 We have strict control over the server and the client parts. This set of web services serve as a backend to a Click Once Windows Forms application. Everything runs on an intranet. Every time the contract changes, it is done in tandem with a new version of the client application.p  p7 WCF is not an option in the short term for this set of web services. When I joined the project over a year ago I was given the task of creating a new set of web services for interoperability with other internal systems. Those web services were designed upfront to be easily upgradable to WCF once upper management allowed us to use WCF. Ill have to take a look into svcutil.exe, but if it does what we need, Ill have another point in trying to convince upper management to adopt WCF. p

Negative 194 pI have a combobox that passes along values in text, but they can have different meanings, e.g.p  ul li830  930  slot 1li li1030  1130  slot 2li li1230  1330  slot 3li ul  porp  ul li830  1130  slots 1 and 2.li li1030  1330  slots 2 and 3li ul  pBasically, I want to pass these values into a database. So if the number of hours required is two, then the option will automatically display 830  1130 or 10301330 already. Once you click the event button, I want the program to automatically calculate how many slots are required, and the number of the slots that need to be entered. At the moment, I can only think of doing it using a gargantuan amount of if statements.p  pClarificationp  pA job will take a number of hours. 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. The hours that each job can be worked on are 830930, 10301130 etc. If a job takes more than one hour, it will take up more than one job slot. However, the combo box I am using right now dynamically generates the possible hours and places them as text into a combo box. Therefore, if a job takes more than one hour, instead of displaying 830930, 10301130 etc. it will display 8301130, 10301330 etc.p  pIm just wondering just had an idea, how do you take a substring in C If I could take a substring, I could give each possible beginning and end a value and do it another way.p  pAny help would be really useful.p
Negative 194 pIm running into a problem with Apache Tomcat 6.0.20 where I cant change a cookies value once it has been added to the response.  Basically, Im trying to replicate Session functionality using cookies.  I have a custom Session object, which is backed by a cookie.  When I create my Session, I pass it an HttpServletResponse, and it creates and adds a blank cookie to the response.  Then, when my code calls the Session.put method, I want to change the value of this cookie.  p  pWhat Im seeing is that once the cookie has been added to the response, any calls to Cookie.setValue are basically useless.  Using a debugger, I can see that the cookie itself is being modified but the SetCookie header in the response object remains unchanged it contains the initial value of the cookie, usually just an empty string.  Ive even tried creating a new cookie and readding it to the response but this has no effect on the SetCookie header either.p  pThe weird thing is Im using a library written a few years ago by our own developers.  In the past we used the JRun 3.1 web server, so Im guessing maybe each web server handles these cookie operations differently.p  pHas anyone run into this problem before  The only solution I have now thats guaranteed to work is not adding the cookie to the response until Im sure Im done with my custom Session object.  I can create a method called Session.saveToHttpServletResponse which will add the cookie to the response.  This works but some of our JSPs can be pretty complicated so Id rather have the Session autosave on every put in case I forget to call Session.saveTo.p  pTo clarify, this is effectively what Im doingp  precodeCookie cookie  new Cookiecustomsession, initial response.addCookiecookie  SetCookie header has customsessioninitial  cookie.setValuenew value  does not change SetCookie header response.addCookiecookie  readding the same cookie, does not work either codepre  pAfter all of that, my browser creates a cookie where customsession is inital, not the last value that I set.p
Negative 194 pI am trying to make changes to the JQuery UI Slider. Changing it from linear in its range of number to more formula based.

However, I think I need some expertise in how to accomplish this or where to begin. p  pRequirements For our carat based search, 90 of our diamonds are between .30 ct to 3.0 ct, which is only 30 of the real estate horizontal of the slider itself. We want it it to slide [.30  3.0] carats for the first 66 of the slider, then increase much faster for the remainder of the slider [3.0  9.0] carats. It almost as we want to change this from moving in a linear form to a more of a curve, i.e. yx1.25 where y is the carat value and x is the position .. maybe using an x2 curve after they have exceed the 3.0 carat marker .. p  pThanks in advance for ANY pointers, support, tips Robertp

Negative 194 pMy application uses an codeintcode as id to identify objects in both inmemory and persistent registry.

Also I believe my assumption is correct that this would not be necessary for a rocket burning fuel in space. The vapour trail will simulated as tiny water droplets which are much larger than the wavelength of visible light, so they would scatter light achromatically.

Negative 194 pI have an Postgre database and a table called mytable. There are 4 columns in that table codeidcode, codecolumn1code, codecolumn2code, codecolumn3code.

Negative 194 pI was looking at the IL code of a valid method with Reflector and Ive run into thisp  precodeL00a5 leave.s L0103 codepre  pInstructions with the suffix code.scode are supposed to take an int8 operand, and sure enough a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.reflection.emit.opcodes.leaves.aspx relnofollowthis should be the case with LeaveS as wella. However, 0x0103 is 259, which exceeds the capacity of an int8. The method somehow works, but when I read the instructions with method codeMono.Reflection.Disassembler.GetInstructionscode it retrievesp  precodeL00a5 leave.s L0003 codepre  pthat is, 3 instead of 259, because its supposed to be an int8. So, my question how is the original instruction codeleave.s L0103code possible I have looked at the a hrefhttpdownload.microsoft.comdownload733733AD40390B24064A81E01035A7FE13CMS20Partition20III.pdf relnofollowECMA documentation for thata emPartition III CIL Instruction Setem and I cant find anything that explains it.p  pAny ideas Thanks.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 1strong Ok, Im an idiot. In the case of branch instructions the offset must be counted from the beginning of the instruction following the current instruction. I swear I read the documentation, but somehow I managed to skip that. In my defence, Im pretty sick today. Sigh.p  pThank you. And thanks for not calling me an idiot, even though this was pretty idiotic Pp  hr  pstrongEDIT 2strong By the way, in case anyone is interested, when codeMono.Reflection.Disassembler.GetInstructionscode disassembles the instructions it changes the meaning of the operand in branch instructions. In particular, as it has been pointed out, the operand of a branch instruction represents the offset emfrom the beginning of the next instructionem, not from 0. However, codeMono.Reflectioncode gives back the offset starting at 0 which may be why I was confused although it doesnt explain how I managed to skip part of the documentation.p  pAn extract of codeMethodBodyReader.ReadOperandInstruction instructioncodep  precodeswitch instruction.OpCode.OperandType  ... case OperandType.ShortInlineBrTarget     instruction.Operand  sbyte il.ReadByte   il.position     break ...  codepre  pAs you can see it adds codeil.positioncode, which is the offset starting at 0 of the next instruction. Also, it casts to codesbytecode, which is the reason Im getting 3 instead of 259. This appears to be a bug the offset starting from 0 may be larger than an codesbytecode. Ill ask Jb Evain the author and report back.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 3strong He hasnt answered yet but Ive changed it top  precodeswitch instruction.OpCode.OperandType  ... case OperandType.ShortInlineBrTarget     instruction.Operand  sbyte il.ReadByte   il.position     break ...  codepre  pand it seems to have solved my problem. I cast to codesbytecode to get the sign right, in case its a backwards jump negative offset, and then when I add codeil.positioncode which is an codeintcode the result is an codeintcode.p  pIll let you know what he says anyway.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 4strong I forgot to report back.

Negative 194 pIm not really sure exactly how the question should be phrased, so please be patient if I ask the wrong thing.p  pIm writing an ASP.NET application using VB as the code behind language. I have a data access class that connects to the DB to run the query parameterized, of course, and another class to perform the validation tasks  I access this class from my aspx page.p  pWhat I would like is to be able to store the data server side and wait for the user to choose from a few options based on the validity of the data. But unless my understanding is completely off, having persistent data objects on the server will give problems when multiple users connect p  pMy ultimate goal is that once the data has been validated the end user cant modify it. Currently Im validating the data, but I still have to retrieve it from the web form AFTER the user says OK, which obviously leaves open the possibility of injecting bad data either accidentally unlikely or on purpose also unlikely for the use, but Id prefer not to take the chance.p  pSo am I completely off in my understanding If so, can someone point me to a resource that provides some instructions on keeping persistent data on the server, or provide instructionp  pThanksp  hr  pConcrete Examplep  pWe recently hired Inspector Gadget to insert data for the Sign Inspectors who go round inspecting the highway signs to make sure none of them have been mangled or stolen by bubblegum chewing, normally upstanding members of the youth city council.p  pIf Gadget can prove his mettle then he might get promoted to do the actual sign inspections. For now, his only job consists of going to this intranet site an inputing information about the most recent inspections. The district, county, route , section of road, and dates the sign was installed and inspected.p  pOf course any of us who were alive in the late 80s are familiar with Gadgets ineptitude. So the site is about as Gadget proof as we can make it. The districtcountyroute is all filled out through a dropdown list, he only has to manually enter the section start and end and the dates. On occasion he fumbles the mouse and ends out swapping the begin and end of the section, doh So the text turns red to alert him of the mistake. Unfortunately he chose to wear his antired sunglasses today that turn all red colors to black. Well, after attempting to submit the data it shows him an error message telling him where and what he needs to fix.  Unfortunately he fat fingered the keyboard and instead of inputting 1.337 he put in 13.37 miles and the road is only 10 miles long Well, now a message a modal div pops up and tells him that the real mileage for the road is 010, and that his entry will combine three sections of the road. Then he is given three buttons to choose from. Cancel, which allows him to go and modify his data, Constrain, which will convert 13.37 to 10, and Override which will allow him to input that data anyway.p  pYowza Gadget exclaimed, and clicked cancel to go back and fix his mistake. Well the next set of data he input correctly, so a confirmation message popped up showing him the changes he was about to make and asking if it was OK to continue. Well, unfortunately Inspector Gadget knocked over his coffee cup, scattering detritus across his desk. In his haste to clean it up, he clicked OK, but not before his GoGoGadget electromagnet accidentally flipped a few bits on his computer, changing the county in the form from ARKANSAS to AKRSANAS, dohp  pHad the data been stored on the server across campus, and the only information passed was OK or Cancel, this would have been avoided.p  hr  pOf course I can always validate emagainem after the OK, but it just seems like a hacky workaround.p  pAnyhow, I hope this clarifiesp

Negative 194 pI have a server application that runs on 64bit Ubuntu server with 4Gb RAM.

Ubuntus top command shows that the virtual memory size is almost 3,2Gb. I dont understand whether Ubuntu allocated the memory I asked for when starting the JVM, or maybe Ubuntu adds a part swap to the Xmx value and thus I get this big size.

Negative 194 pIm currently working on an application where we receive private health information.  One of the biggest concerns is with the SSN.  Currently, we dont use the SSN for anything, but in the future wed like to be able to use it to uniquely identify a patient across multiple facilities.  The only way I can see to do that reliably is through the SSN.  However, we in addition to our customers REALLY dont want to store the SSN.  p  pSo naturally, I thought of just SHA hashing it since were just using it for identification.  The problem with that is that if an attacker knows the problem domain an SSN, then they can focus on that domain.  So its much easier to calculate the billion SSNs rather than a virtually unlimited number of passwords.  I know I should use a site salt and a perpatient salt, but is there anything else I can do to prevent an attacker from revealing the SSN  Instead of SHA, I was planning on using BCrypt, since Ruby has a good library and it handles scalable complexity and salting automagically.p  pIts not going to be used as a password.  Essentially, we get messages from many facilities, and each describes a patient.  The only thing close to a globally unique identifier for a patient is the SSN number.  We are going to use the hash to identify the same patient at multiple facilities.p

Negative 194 pSo Ive been working on porting an IIS6 ISAPI module to IIS7. One problem that I have is that I need to be able to parse and process responses, and then changedeleteadd some HTTP headers based on the content. I got this working fine for most content, but it appears to break down when chunked encoding is being used on the response body.p  pIt looks like CHttpModuleOnSendResponse is being called once for each chunk. Ive been able to determine when a chunked response is being sent, and to buffer the data until all of the chunks have been passed in, and set the entity count to 0 to prevent it from sending that data out, but after the first OnSendResponse is called the headers are sent to the client already, so Im not able to modify them later after Ive already processed the chunked data.p  pI realize that doing this is going to eliminate the benefits of the chunked encoding, but in this case it is necessary.p  pThe only example code I can find for IIS Native Modules are very simplistic and dont demonstrate performing any filtering of response data. Any tips or links on this would be great.p  pstrongEditstrong Okay, I found IHttpResponseSuppressHeaders, which will prevent the headers from being sent after the first OnSendResponse. However, now it will not send the headers at all. So what I did was when its a chunked response I set it to suppress headers, and then later after I process the response, I check to see if the headers were suppressed, and if they were I read all of the headers from raw response structure HTTPRESPONSE, and insert them at the beginning of the response entity chunks myself. This seems to work okay so far.p  pStill open to other ideas if anybody has any better option.p

Negative 194 pCertainly it is not the best practice, but I need to load a file and get its contents within the same function call. That is calling the codeurlLoader.loadcode function and then waiting say with an codewhiletruecode for the contents to load.p  pI am stuck with the fact that flash will not trigger events nor continue with the file loading until the current thread finishes. Is there any way to allow flash to make the file contents available without exiting the current method call.p  pOn a side note, I know this is not a good thing to do. This is only for easing a process in a local environment in which I need the file contents without waiting for an event. If I let the process continue other events already queued will fire and becomes a mess. Sadly refactoring the code to wait altogether would be too much effort.p

Negative 194 pI have a question about forms. I have a fairly standard form that saves a post called an eReport in my app with a title and body. The table also has a published field, which is boolean.

Negative 194 pI need help clarifying the correct structure and process flow for an MVC application in PHP.p  pI think Ive got the concept round the wrong way because currently most of my processing is done or at least initiated by the Views.  I kind of inherited this way of thinking from the company Im working for, but now Im not sure that they are understanding the MVC model correctlyp  pHaving looked at it again I think that the proccess should be as follows very basiclyp  ul liThe users actions are sent to the Controllerli liThe Controller process those actions using any Models requiredli liThe Controller then instantiates the relevent View and passes the required data to itli liThe View renders the page to the userli ul  phr Im also having some difficulty deciding wether the view should even have any real functionality in it or not.p  pi.e. Is it just a wrapper to hold the page data and load the required template files header, page, footer etc., OR should any functions to do with rendering data i.e. preparing HTML and outputting HTML be in the Viewp  phr Another question is does the controller hand over to the model and have nothing to do with the actual DBconn so that the Model acts like a Bouncer on the doors of the DB nightclub, and were not on the list OR does the controller own the DBconn and simply lends it to a model when it needs itp  pbr Id really appreciate any help and advice anyone can offer.p  pThanksp  pbr edit  I found a hrefhttpbestpracticesoftwareengineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.atpatternsmvc.html relnofollowthisa helpfulp

If I do this dynamically, sometimes the dialog doesnt open any morep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.nett67y73 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nett67y73ap  pOr sometimes the dialog opens with the old HTML because its cached at the bottom of the page that way.  What is up with thisp

Negative 194 pI have inherited a Rails 3 application with a cookiesession problem. Namely, something seems to be nondeterministically cleaning out all of the information in a session or cookie, every so often. Ive reproduced the bug while watching in a console, and the application is sending back, every so often, an empty session cookie, clear as day. Its nicely Base64 encoded as I would expect from a Rails cookie store seems something is overzealous about deleting a session andor cookies. Great, a bug, lets fix it.p  pMy question is how do I debug a session or cookie problem in Rails 3 This application has a fairly sizable mound of dependencies and a sizable heap of its own code Id rather just observe the session and cookies, I dont know of a good way to see whats editing them. I can output what they are at the beginning of a request, and after one, but its all Very Rails Magical in the middle. I dont even see how to overwrite the session setters, since its just a hash implemented in C. I did some acking but it didnt reveal anything amazing, and I know a lot of session magic happens in Rails itself so I doubt the actual session   is happening in the application.p  pAny ideas here What can I monkeypatch, where can I plug in Is there some test facility for sessions or cookies Im unaware ofp

Negative 194 pI have a GUI application which includes a number of icons used for toolbar buttons, menu glyphs, notification icons etc. These icons are linked to the application as resources and a variety of different sizes are available. Typically, for toolbar button images I have available 16px, 24px and 32px versions. My icons are 32bpp with partial transparency.p  pThe application is high DPI aware and adjusts the size of all visual elements according to the prevailing font scaling. So, for example, at 100 font scaling, 96dpi, the toolbar icon size is 16px. At 125 scaling, 120dpi, the toolbar icon size is 20px. I need to be able to load an icon of size 20px without any aliasing effects. How can I do this Note that I would like to support Windows 2000 and later.p
Negative 194 pIm pretty new to Ajax, but I thought the point of using it was the Asynchronous part. Unfortunately, I seem to be stuck in synchronous hell.p  pEarly in my page, a number of elements are created, each with a unique ID.p  pAt the very end of my page, using jQuery I iterate over each element and issue an ajax call where I explicitly set codeasynccode to true. Currently on complete, each Ajax call just populates the corresponding element with some text output. Eventually it will be an IMG.p  pWhat occurs is that I get the busy mouse cursor on the page and certain elements do not populate until all 17 XHR requests come back. p  pHeres my jQuery callp  precodejQuery.ajaxitem.eachfunctionindex     item  jQuerythis     ID  item.attrid      item.loadWPGlobals.ajaxurl,  action  myaction, ID  ID      jQuery.ajax         url  WPGlobals.ajaxurl,         type  POST,         async  true,         data   action  myaction, ID  ID ,         success  functionresponse item.htmlresponse        codepre  pLooking at this code above you will note that this is a WordPress site though I dont know what that would have to do with anything, and that I also tried the simpler codeloadcode method, and switched to codeajaxcode so I could force codeasync  truecode in case there was any funny messing around with the Globals as a result of some WP weirdness.p  pAm I going about this the right way Shouldnt my page load regardless of the AJAX and then those items will just lazily populate when the XHRs come inp  pEDIT  I just noticed that my logic is messed in the static call I probably need a closure in order to get item to scope properly, but thats neither here nor there as far as the async issue  it still fires off 17 XHRs and waits for them all to come home before the page load is complete.p

Negative 194 pI am working on a project where I have to load assemblies lets call them tasks at runtime, run the task and then be able to kill off the whole assembly so that the dll can be replaced without interrupting the main application.p  pThere are many of these tasks running within the main application, some run sequentially and some run in parallel.   Occasionally one or to of these tasks need to be updated and then readded to the queue.   Currently we are stopping the entire application and interrupting the other tasks at whatever stage they are at, which is not ideal.p  pI have figured out that I will have to load each assembly into a separate AppDomain, but loading the assemblies in those domains is proving difficult, especially when I need to actually run the tasks and receive events from them.   I have been looking into this problem for a couple of days and have still not managed to get a working proofofconcept.p  pI have an Interface for the tasks which includes a run and kill method subs and a taskstep, complete and killed event.   taskstep returns an object to be cached later, complete fires when the whole task is done and killed fires when it is ready to be unloaded.   There should also be a timeout on the whole process of two hours and a timeout of 2 minutes on the killed event in case it gets stuck, at which point I would like to be able to unload it, forcing any threads to terminate which is what kill should do anyway.   Each assembly may contain several tasks, all of which should loadable be unloadable.p  pI have no problems loading these tasks as plugins but am lost when trying to both use them and unload them.   If I have to create some elaborate wrapper then so be it but is what I need even possiblep  pI have tried inheriting from MarshalByRefObject but I do not even know the assembly fullname unless I load it first, which then locks the file.  I have tried loading from a byte array of the assembly.  This means that the file is not locked but a copy of it remains in the current appdomain.  This will become problematic over the following months  yearsp  precodeFor Each key As String In assemblies.Keys      Dim ad As AppDomain  AppDomainHelper.BuildChildAppDomainAppDomain.CurrentDomain, key      AddHandler ad.AssemblyResolve, AddressOf AssemblyResolve      l.Addad      For Each value As String In assemblieskey         Dim item As IScanner  CTypead.CreateInstanceAndUnwrapkey, value, IScanner         ListBox1.Items.Additem     Next Next  Private Function AssemblyResolvesender As Object, args As ResolveEventArgs As Assembly     Return GetTypeIScanner.Assembly End Function codepre

However, this wont catch any exceptions that are thrown in other parts of this outer page tag.

Negative 194 pIm using jScrollPane great stuff for scrollbars in my portfolio website, but im running in to a problem that i cant seem to solve myself. p  pThe problem is highlighted when i change the width and length of the div with jQuery.p  pI have a columndivprojects with the width of 180px. Inside that div theres a list of links. When a user clicks a link the div needs to grow to 480px  width. Also the content of the div change. The list of links disappears and a list of projects is shown. That piece works. But jScrollPane wont grow with the content as i want it to do. Ive got 2 different problems with that.p  pSafari In Safari the vertical scrollbar grows automatically with the content. So that works fine. But when the width of the div grows to 400px, suddenly there appears a horizontal scrollbar with the width of 180pxthe previous width of the div. . p  pFirefox The biggest problem is in Firefox however. There, the vertical scrollbar wont automatically grow with the content. I tried using autoReinitialise, that works fine for the vertical scrollbar to grow with the content, but delivers me another problem. When i use autoReinitialise, the div who just grew to 480px, goes back to 180px again. So autoReinitialise does not solve my problem. p  pIn Firefox you can also see that one div doesnt look the way it should if you have clicked a link and see the projects. Thats around the height of the previous content the list with links.p  pThats my biggest problem. But i also have another small question is it possible to always show the scrollbars OR give unique classes to every div.scrollpane  Cause when i adjust the width of divprojects to 480px, i also have to change the width of the scrollpane container. Now, i use jQuery to give every div a unique class. And if the scrollbars are not always visible, there are not always the same amount of divs. So now i always show the scrollbars by putting another div under the content. But if i can give every scrollpane div a unique class manually i dont need to always show the scrollbars. p  pThe website where this is al about a hrefhttpnieuw.yworks.nl relnofollowhttpnieuw.yworks.nla.

Negative 194 pnow i am here to ask for best practice about working with graphics. I am using windows forms. So   At base i have large image 3.7k x 5.3k pixels On top of that i want to draw graph  Vertexes and edges vertex is like circle and edge is arrow between circlesp  pAt the moment i used picturebox with SizeMode set to Zoom, so i can increase picturebox widht and height to act like zoom option. in Paint event i draw vertexes which intersects with with DisplayRectangle. Same with edges. I have option to add edges  while i move mouse i invalidate picturebox so it looks like animation i draw another Vertex on mouse location.p  pProblem is  when i have around 10k vertexes, frames per second drops to like 1 or 2.  If you know some good ways to make this thing smooth and optimised, please share with me  p

Negative 194 pIm new to Sencha Touch and MVC mostly for that matter, we have a UI team member using the Sencha Designer 2 to create the interface, but at the moment hes create a lot of different models one model for each store. But there is only the one AJAX file that it is referencing, just with different parameters.p  pSo is it possible to make the parameters dynamic depending on which store is trying to access it. Ie, if store User is trying to access the model can it put in ajax.phpstoreuser, if store Facebook is trying to access the model it can put in ajax.phpstorefacebook, so on and so forth. It just seems silly to me to have one model per store, very redundant. p  pIf this is an obvious fix, i am sorry, like i said im new to Sench Touch p

Negative 194 pI order to get access to the Facebook API on behalf of a user, one must get an OAuth accesstoken, the process is well documented albeit it appears to be some undocumented requirements from FB but from time to time I get this Error validating verification code. when trying to exchange a validation code for an accesstoken.p  pThere seems to be a lot of people having such trouble and most of the time the redirecturi seems to be the issue, but here the redirecturi is fine its exactly the same as the one passed to the auth dialog, ends with a slash and do not have funky characters or a trailing query string, I read almost all threads on SO about this issue and none of the proposed solutions did solve my problemp  pWhat is the most intriguing is that when I check my logs, where I write the exact request url I use, and manually try it to get the access token, then it works. It is like the request is failing when the user logs in but works after some time.p  pSo the fact that it is working after all seems to indicate that the request is fine but there is a problem on the Facebook side, like if there was some replication involved that did not complete between the time the auth dialog do its thing and I try to exchange the code for a token.p  pI put in place a retry mechanism, hoping that the delay between two calls would be enough and the second call would succeed, but it doesnt work either.p  pAlso, its working most of the time and I cannot tell any difference between when it works and when it fails, only the user changes.p  pAny suggestion would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 194 pWe had a kernel module which writes into a file and we read the proc file to get some information regarding hardware operation. The hardware operation statistics data became more than 3072 bytes PROCBLOCKSIZE  so we locally buffer the data by defining a global buffer of size 4096 bytes . Once the data is completely read then we move the data to the procreadkernel buffer to the local buffer. This is done as per hack 2 defined around line number 165 in linux2.6.28procfsgeneric.c. We are not sending eof till the entire buffer is read so read proc will be called two times one for 3072 bytes and next for 1024 bytes. We do a memcpy to copy the data to the read proc buffer. The read proc will be invoked only by command line.p  pBut inserting this particular module after adding the global buffer is making some difference in the performance numbers of get from storage device . If we do not do modprobe of this kernel module then we are seeing better numbers. Logically the global buffer will be in BSS area and since the command is not called so memcpy will also not be invoked. We are not able to explain this anomaly. Any pointers will be highly helpful.p
Negative 194 pAs our users get more familiar with the wiki functionality, and like it, we see that pages are getting longer and more difficult to navigate.p  pWe would like to be able to generate table of contents on a perwikipage basis to allow easier navigation, i.e. the users create content whose hierarchy is represented by h2h3h4 elements and then the TOC is automatically generated at the top of the wiki page with each entry in the TOC being a link to the corresponding h2h3h4 element in the page.p  pWe do not have access to Sharepoint Designer so any funny stuff will have to involve cssjavascript inserted using a Content Editor Web Part.p  pBest regards,p  pColm OGairbhithp

Negative 194 pThis is the first question Ive ever asked on here, as normally I can find an answer that will solve all my problems. However, this week Ive hit quite the wall. p  pIm using a canvas on my page thats working great and can be saved as an image file.

My issue is that my image is larger than a single page and only the first page of my image prints. Is there any way to print my canvas across multiple pages, or should i just chalk this up to bad browser to printer functionality and get my users who need to print to use a different program after saving their canvas locallyp  pThanksp

Negative 194 pI have this strange issue where emsometimesem if I make two AJAX requests to my Apache 2.2 server in rapid succession, the second request will wait for the first to finish before finishing.p  pExample, I have two requests, one that sleeps for 10 seconds and one that returns immediately. If I run the request that returns immediatly by itself it will always return within 300ms. However, if I call the request that takes 10 seconds, and then call the request that returns right away about 50 of the time the second request will wait until the first finishes and chrome will report that the request too about 10 seconds before receiving a response. The other half of the time the quick request will return right away.p  pI cant find any pattern to make it behave one way or another, it will just randomly block the quick AJAX requests sometimes, and other times it will behave as expected.

Negative 194 pIm using strutsspringhibernate.p  pOn my .jsp page, I have two autocompleter drop down menus.  Each one returns a list of VOs from their specific table in the database, which is then used to call a search action that searches from another table.  Menu A links to table A, and menu B links to table B, and they are used to search in table C.  However, table B has a foreign key that links it to table A  Table C has a foreign key that links it to table B.  p  pI would like it to be that when the user picks an option from menu A, menu B is updated so it only includes options that contain the proper foreign key.  The user then can pick something specific from menu B and have the action search table C only for rows containing the proper foreign key.  If the user does not touch table B, then the action will search for all rows in table C containing all foreign keys from Table B that match the one chosen in table A.p  pI hope this is understandable and let me know if I need to clarify.  Ive been googling for some time and it might be a simple solution but I cant find anything.  Thanks.p

Negative 194 pIm implementing my own text editor in c. Its going... ok. Pp  pI need a way to turn a keycode specifically Allegro, they call it scancodes into an ASCIIchar.

Negative 194 pWhile testing some realtime simulation code which uses a Swingworker I noticed my GUI always seems to run at 30 fps, no more, no less. I update the GUI everytime the user interacts with the application like a mouse move or when the process method of the Swingworker is called. The Swingworker doesnt do anything right now, it just grabs the mouse location from the GUI and sends it back as a clone through the publish and process methods Im just doing this to see what I can and cant do when communicating between threads because multithreading is still fairly new to me. I dont have any timers anywhere, the process method of the Swingworker calls repaint on the GUI, so I was wondering what causes the GUI to update at 30 fps Is there maybe like a vsync active in the GUI by default or is it some behaviour of the process method in the Swingworker And finally is there a way to get higher frameratesp  pHeres an sscce which exhibits this behaviourp  precodepublic class SimGameTest implements Runnable      public static void mainString[] args          SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew SimGameTest           Override     public void run          MainWindow mainWindow  new MainWindownew Game          mainWindow.setLocationRelativeTonull         mainWindow.setVisibletrue        public class MainWindow extends JFrame      private Game        game     private GamePanel   gamePanel      public MainWindowGame game          this.game  game          createAndShowGUI          startGame           private void startGame          GameSim gameSim  new GameSimgame, gamePanel         gameSim.execute           private void createAndShowGUI          setTitleSim game test         setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         setResizablefalse          JPanel contentPane  new JPanelnew GridBagLayout          gamePanel  new GamePanelgame         contentPane.addgamePanel          addcontentPane         pack        public class Game      public Point            mouseLocation        new Point     public Point            clonedMouseLocation  new Point   public class GameSim extends SwingWorkerltPoint, Pointgt      private Game                game     private GamePanel           gamePanel      public GameSimGame game, GamePanel gamePanel          this.game  game         this.gamePanel  gamePanel           Override     protected Point doInBackground throws Exception          while true              publishPoint game.mouseLocation.clone                    Override     protected void processListltPointgt pointList          game.clonedMouseLocation  pointList.getpointList.size  1         gamePanel.repaint        public class GamePanel extends JPanel      private Game                game     private long                lastTime      public GamePanelGame game          this.game  game         setPreferredSizenew Dimension512, 512     addMouseMotionListenernew GamePanelListener           Override     public void paintComponentGraphics g           draw background         g.setColornew Color0, 0, 32         g.fillRect0, 0, getWidth, getHeight          g.setColornew Color192, 192, 255         g.drawStringgame.clonedMouseLocation.x  ,   game.clonedMouseLocation.y, 10, 502          long now  System.nanoTime         long timePassed  now  lastTime         lastTime  now         double fps  double 1000000000  timePassed         g.drawStringfps   fps, 10, 482           private class GamePanelListener extends MouseInputAdapter          Override         public void mouseMovedMouseEvent e              if containse.getPoint                  game.mouseLocation  e.getPoint                             codepre  pI created another version where I just count the number of times the GUI was repainted and show the count on screen, and it seems to be increasing at a rate of 30 per second, so I guess the fps calculation isnt the problem.p

Negative 194 pIs there a way to handle the error WebDev.WebServer.Exe has stopped working in ASP.NET and keep the page running or even the just the WebServer running  Or is this an impossible task and is essentially like asking how to save someones life after theyve diedp  pI have the errorcausing code inside a trycatch block, but that doesnt make a difference.

Negative 194 pI have a Perl library that uses many objects of some about 3 or 4 classes during its operation.p  pIn testing code, Id like to ensure it isnt too many Im not talking about memory leaks, I know how to check that. To this end, I thought I could count every object used and check the maximum used during the run on the test data. Then, I would compare the obtained number to some guess about how many objects the library should use.p  pHowever, Ive got problems implementing this. I thought about two possible waysp  ul lipintercept codePackagenewcode and codePackageDESTROYcode. However, this has a little catch that in that package, codenewcode doesnt always return a new object. Sometimes, it uses a preexisting one the objects are used as immutables, so it shouldnt matter much. So Id have to track each individual object to see if it existed before.pli lipintercept codePackageblesscode and codePackageDESTROYcode. This should work, but seems a little unorthodox.pli ul  pThe question is, which of those ways is more likely to succeed maybe what is commonly used in similar situations, and secondly, how would I even implement the second way would I have to override codePackageblesscode for all packages in question or only base classes etc..p

Negative 194 pWe have a number of controllers with very similar functionality, there is a lot of code duplication. There are base controllers which contain some code that is used in all of them however most is still duplicated. Each controller has a constructor, the services are being injected by castle.p  pI was thinking would it be possible to use generics with controllers to reduce the amount of duplication. Have the similar code in a base class and override any instances where the code deviates.p  pAlternatively I you could do the same without generics and have more of the duplicate code in the base.p  pWhat would be the best approach and how would generics be implemented in controllers Im guessing they would make use of interfaces as well.p

Negative 194 pI have two Python classes codeNotecode and codeLinkcode mapping to PostgresQL tables.  codeNotecode has a foreignkey reference to codeLinkcode, while codeLinkcode points back to the node through a piece of JSON text.

Heres what I have tried so far I create the codeNotecode object and THEN try to create the codeLinkcode in the codeevents.afterinsertcode eventp  precodeclass NoteEntity     name  FieldUnicode     link  ManyToOneLink      . . .      events.afterinsert     def createlinkself                  Create and persist the short link for this note.  Must be done         in this afterinsert event because the link table has a foreign         key that points back to the note.  We need the note to be          already inserted so we can use its id.                  self.link  Link.buildlinkfornoteself         elixir.session.flush         printNOTE s GOT LINK s  self, self.link codepre  pIn the Link class I havep  precodeclass LinkEntity     . . .      classmethod     def buildlinkfornotecls, note         return Linkcontentid d  note.id codepre  pBoth tables have autoincremented primary keys, so no worries there.  The error that I get with this code isp  precodeFile ...sqlalchemyormsession.py, line 1469, in flush     raise saexc.InvalidRequestErrorSession is already flushing     InvalidRequestError Session is already flushing codepre  pIll buy that.  The codeafterinsertcode event gets called I think emafterem the Note got stored to the database, which happened during the current session flush. And of course if I remove the codeelixir.session.flushcode call, then of course it printsp  precodeNOTE ltNote id4 nameDaniellegt GOT LINK ltidNone contentt 4gt codepre  pwhich again makes sense since I havent been able to persist the linkp  pSo my question is, how can I, create both a Note and a Link in a single request, so that the mutually dependent ids are available and properly recordedp  pP.S. I understand that the schema here is a little unusal, and that I can solve this issue by either 1 spawning a task to create the Link asynchronously or 2 making the codeLink.contentcode method create the link lazily.  These solutions require some concurrency attention, so I am really hoping that a simple, direct SQLAlchemy solution with one session can work.p

Negative 194 pI am using Z3 to solve satisfiability problems including several hundred XOR clauses with 22 inputs each. To code the XOR clauses in DIMACS form, I am using Tseitin encoding. My conversion breaks the XORs down to smaller CNF clauses with up to five literals each.

Negative 194 pIll first do some contextualization. Im trying to implement a nonblocking work stealing  method using deques in CUDA. The deques aDeques are in a blocksegmented array in global memory and the popWork device function has the objective of popping work to feed threads. In addition of the global deques, each block has a stack in shared memory aLocalStack where it can locally work. The pop occurs in 3 levels. First attempt is in the shared stack, second attempt is in the deque owned by the block and third attempt is work steal other deques. Each deque has global bottom and pop pointers that lie in a global memory arrays aiDequesBottoms and auiDequesAges. My problem is that when a block changes a global deque pointer, the changes aarent being visible by other blocks when I test code in a GTS450. It seems like cache is not being updated. I have also tested in a GT520 card, where the problem does not occur. I have experienced similar problems with the aiDequeFlags array. These problems are solved by declaring it volatile. Unfortunatelly, I cant do the same to the deque pointer arrays, since I need to use atomic functions on them later. Im sorry to not put the problem in a simpler example, but I couldnt reproduce this behavior. This first snippet has the popWork interface explained .p  precodetemplate ltint iDequeSizegt Size of each segment in aDeques  bool inline device popWork     volatile int aiDequeFlags , Flags that indicates if a deque is active has work     int aiDequesBottoms , Deque bottom pointers     unsigned int auiDequesAges , Deque top pointers 29 higher bits                                     Tag bits3 lower bits.     const Int2Array aDeques , Deques Int2Array is an interface for 2 int arrays     int ampuiStackBot , Shared memory stack pointer     int2 aLocalStack , Shared memory local stack     const int ampiTid , threadIdx.x     const int ampiBid , blockIdx.x      All other parameters are output  unsigned int ampuiPopDequeIdx , Choosen deque for pop     int2 popStartIdxAndSize , Arrays of pop start index and sizes     bool bPopFlag , Array of flags for pop in each level unsigned int ampuiActiveDequesIdx , Flag to indicate pop failed no more work     int2 ampwork Actual acquired thread work codepre  pThis second snippet has the entire function.

Negative 194 pI have a simple question which my Google searches were unable to find a decent answer to. I completely understand how to design websites with HTML, CSS and ColdFusion, but they always tend to look like a regular website with common navigation bar across the top, a sidebar, and then some main content.p  pHowever I have also seen some software being used which looks exactly like a Windows Office application, even though it is being delivered through a browser. The ones I have seen are used in HR and CRM applications which are hosted in the cloud and accessed by companies through the internet. They look and feel exactly like Microsoft Outlook with the same rich functionality but are actually a website.p  pSo my questions is how do you go about making a site look like a Windows application Where do you get all the nice icons, fonts, colour schemes, Javascript to put together a Windows theme Do you have to do everything from scratch yourselfp

Negative 194 pin my projects I dont use Interface Builder and Ive noticed one thing that I dont know how to explain. Yet. So, to the point. When we are using IB and defining elements of user interface like UILabel or UIButton in our controller we use this ugly prefix IBOutlet and a weak modifier. This works like music. But when we decide not to use IB and define whole user interface from code it just doesnt work. p  pLets assume that I want to add UILabel to controller using IB. I will have something like this i .h filep  precodeproperty nonatomic, weak IBOutlet UILabel  label codepre  pAnd I dont have to do anything more in .m file. But if I remove the .xib file and try to setup my UILabel in, for example, one of init methods, like thisp  precodeself.label  [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0,0,100,20] self.label.text  some text [self.view addSubviewself.label] codepre  pIt doesnt work until I alter my .h file to thisp  precodeproperty nonatomic, strong UILabel  label codepre  pNow, I know the difference between weak and strong but I have no idea why we can use weak for ui elements when using IB Something must keep a strong pointers to these elements, right But what In second case it is controller, but I dont understand how it behaves in the first case.p

If I remove this particular line, every single behavior appears in the list which is to be expected.  However,   When I try to add something to the incidents table, that the error is actually being thrown in the BehaivorViewController this is very surprising to me, because I instantiated new NSFetchedResultsController,  AppDelegate, and NSManagedObjectContext that are specifically local to each respective view controller.

Negative 194 pIm running socket.ionode.js on my EC2 autoscaling array of servers. As soon as I have more than 1 server, there is the obvious problem where the socket.io connections need to be shared between the servers.

I tried using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comkofsocket.iomongo relnofollowsocket.iomongoa module, but it absolutely killed my servers huge CPU usage.p  pIs there any other way to share the socket.io session between EC2 serversp

Would I seriously be expected to package the log4j.jar and log4j.xml into all of them I would hope not, so maybe setting Djboss.as.logging.perdeploymentfalse will help But I still see people saying to put log4j.jar and log4j.xml into earwar files even with that set.p  pIf someone could please tell me how I can mimic my 4.0.4 set up please.p  pThanks, Paulp

Negative 194 pI am somewhat new to ios but Ive been able to muddle though... until now. I have an application with a login page. First thing I did was create a few empty view controllers and stuck them on a storyboard. I have a LoginViewController with some text fields for userId and password plus a login button. Plan is if you successfully log in you are brought to a TabViewController. Right now this is out of the box. I deleted the two view controllers that got created with it and replaced them with two NavigationControllers.p  pJust to test everything I made a segue from the login button to the TabViewController. Everything worked fine. Views came up. All the out of the box stuff worked.p  pNext step I tried to simulate an actual login. Since I have to do this through a web service call I figured it needed to be asynchronous. I deleted the initial segue I added for the login button and added a IBAction from the button to my LoginViewController. I also added a manual segue from my LoginViewController to the TabViewController and I named it loginSeguep  pHere is the code I have so farp  precode IBActionloginidsender  [Decorator showViewBusyInself.aView             scale1.5         makeWhiteNO]  self.clientIdText.enabled  NO self.userIdText.enabled  NO self.passwordText.enabled  NO UIButton loginBtn  sender  loginBtn.enabled  NO [Decorator showViewBusyInself.aView              scale2.0          makeWhiteNO]  self.operation  [[NSInvocationOperation alloc]             initWithTargetself                   selectorselectordoLogin                 objectnil] self.queue  [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init] [self.queue addOperationself.operation]   voiddoLogin     [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval1]     [Decorator removeBusyIndicatorFromself.aView]  this is where I will eventually put the login code...     [self performSegueWithIdentifierloginSegue senderself]  codepre  pI put the call to sleepForTimeInterval to simulate waiting for the web service call to complete. I will remove it later. The Decorator stuff just shows and removes an Activity Indicator View. p  pWhen I do all this the segue works but the view associated with the login view controller remains on the screen. Put another way, the TabViewController shows up. The first item is selected. The NavigationController shows up but the VC associated with it and the view it contains does not appear. The view from the LoginViewController stays there.p  pSince all navigation worked fine when I put the segue on the login button Im thinking it has something to do with the invocation operation. Either that or somehow my view or view controller hierarchy is getting messed up. p  pAny ideas as to what Im doing wrong Is this a good way to do a loginp  pAny help is much appreciated, Natp

Negative 194 pI am trying to create a virtual magazine line turnjs.com, I Purchesed the commerical version of the library, and all works well when I only have a few pages. But when I try to run the site with book that has 172 images 300 dpi 2550 x 3263 and sized down with CSS  IE stops loading the images after about 50. p  pI though it was a turn.js problem at first, so I stripped out all the turnjs code and wrote a simple js p  precodewindow.loadfunction      forvar i0iltContentArray.lengthi          content.appendltimg src  ContentArray[i]   stylewidth600px height600pxgt         codepre  pContent Array is loaded from an ajax call and it just contains the paths to the images. When the code runs it loads the images up until about 50 or so then it just show the red x. p  pNow My question is, this works in Fire Fox and Chrome but not IE, is there a limit on how many image or better yet the size of the images IE loads. I am only targeting IE9. p  pAny help would be very greatly appreciated. and I know the Images are rather large, I need them to be this large to allow zooming. p  hr  ul liCheck for new versions of stored pages  automaticallyli liDisk space to use 300 MBli liDays to keep pages in history 20li ul  pI thought it may have been my dev machine, but I have checked these settings and I tested this on two different PCs plus a freshly created windows 7 pro virtual Machine. What I have done is lower the DPI on the images, and it loaded more images, but still not all of them, then I lowered further down to 150 DPI and all of the images loaded, the problem with a dpi so low is the text in the images gets very pixelated, and zooming makes for a very unpleasent experiance. p  pDoes anyone know what the limit on IE is when it comes to large images 300k to 500k in size. The only solution I have seen so far is to require my users to install ChromeFramep

Negative 194 pHello everyone and thank you for many useful topics on stackoverflow they helped me a lot since Im very inexperienced in programming. As part of a project for university Im trying to implement a perspective correction on business cards to prepare them for OCR in C using OpenCV libraries. I found the automated corner detection via Canny and Hough to be somewhat unreliable depending on the particular card and the background so I would like to implement a way to select the corners manually for now.p  pI found the following code OpenCVSelect.cpp by the user ajithsri on sourceforge  a hrefhttpsourceforge.netpopencvselmovcodecimastertree relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netpopencvselmovcodecimastertreea , which is exactly what I needed. However after playing around with it for some time it suddenly crashed making me suspicious. Looking at the task manager while clicking around and moving points I noticed that a huge amount of memory is used without being released until the program crashes.p  pNow, like I said I am really inexperienced when it comes to programming and I couldnt find whats wrong with the code so please forgive me if the solution is obvious for you. I would really appreciate if someone could help me with the memory problem in the code so I could use it for my project.p  pThank youp  pOpenCV libraries and black.jpg is needed p

Negative 194 pSomehow I suspect this is very simple, but Im just looking at it all the wrong way. p  pI am dynamically loading the page name part of the href into the FB like box HTML5 code.  This is triggered by clicking a button fbtn  and each button has a different page name attached to it the buttons and page names are also created dynamically.  This works fine in as much as a the page names are being passed to the function and b first time, the FB code fires correctly and generates a display.  When I close the div that displays the Like Box and click a second button or the same one again, the variable page name is being passed, but it seems the FB code is not being fired  so, the div displays, but nothing is in it.p  pThe FB code is included inside this function to prevent it running automatically on page load when the buttons and page names have not been created.p  pIs there some way to reset the entire function so that on clicking close as below, the variable function is back in the state it was before the first click i.e. waiting to be passed a variable page name and to run the FB codep  pThanks for any suggestions.p  precodeclassOne.onclick,.fbtn, function     fbid  this.value       if fbid          fbid  Boo         alert  fbid     functiond, s, id    var js, fjs  d.getElementsByTagNames[0]   if d.getElementByIdid return   js  d.createElements js.id  id   js.src  connect.facebook.netenUSall.jsxfbml1ampappIdXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   fjs.parentNode.insertBeforejs, fjs   document, script, facebookjssdk    fbLike.htmlltdiv id closeFBgtCloseltdivgtltdiv idfbrootgtltdivgtltfblikebox     hrefhttpswww.facebook.com  fbid   width900 height500 showfacestrue streamtrue showbordertrue headertruegtltfblikeboxgt    closeFB.stop.animateheight20,50    fbLike.stop.animateheight500,500    closeFB.clickfunction     fbLike.html.stop.animateheight0,500    closeFB.stop.animateheight0,50   codepre
Negative 194 pSo I have a codeUITableViewcode, where all cells have a codeUITextFieldcode in them as a subview with a codetag1code. Whats troubling me is that I want when a user clicks on a textField and edits it to know on which row has that happened. What I think can solve it, is to make the cell select itself when the subview codeUITextFieldcode is selected. How can I achieve thatp  pI tried with an array, but because cells are reused, it wouldnt work. Looping through all of the rows would be simply too slow.p

Negative 194 pIm writing a bash script to automate some job, and in the meantime practice with bash. Im writing a script to automate some git cloning and updating stuff. My script will have three options g, f, h. When someone types h it should display the help message which I have written but omitted it below, when someone writes g, it should accept at least one argument, but it can also accept second one as optional. From which, the first one will be the url of the repository to clone and second one will be the directory, where to clone it. On the other hand, if someone types f, the script should get just one argument, just a file name. Then I want to read the file, line by line, and do git cloning and updating for each git url inside the file.p  pIf I run the script I get the following error message for each option, and if I call it without any option, or with a valid option followed by some other argument, it still doesnt do anything, just returnsp  precode.gitupdate.sh option requires an argument  g codepre  pI guess it doesnt use 2 and 3 somehow in my code. But then again, when I pass h, all it has to do is call the help function and display the message, doesnt need to use any other argument.p  pI guess the problem is because I have something wrong at the bottom, where I use getopts to get the option name specified by the user. In my code I assume that the option is the first argument, 1, and then the second one 2 is the url or filename, according to the option specified, and the 3 is the optional one that works only with g option.p  pBelow you can find my codep  precodebinbash  declare defaultdirectoryHOME declare action declare src  function clonerepo      if [ n 2 ] then         if [ ls A 2 2gtdevnull ] then             cd 2         else             git clone 1 2         fi     else         git clone 1         TODO Get the directory name created by cloning                       and cd to it.     fi      git remote add upstream 1     git fetch upstream   function readreposfromfile      if [ f 1 ] then         while read r line do             clonerepo line 2         done lt 1     else         echo e Error The specified file could not be found.         exit 1     fi   while getopts fhr option do     case option in         f actionreadreposfromfile srcOPTARG         g actionclonerepo srcOPTARG         h help  exit 1      esac done  shift OPTIND1  [ z action ] ampamp  help exit 1  codepre  pIf someone could help me, I would be glad.p  pstrongEDITstrong Corrected some typo mistakes in the above code. And updated the error message. The script doesnt work correctly. I guess I need to change something in my code, to make it do something, and actually get 2 and 3 arguments. It even doesnt display the help message, when h option is passed, and all I do there is call the help function that I have previously created. Maybe I need to somehow change my getopts part.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong Made the advised changes, and changed the above code.p

Negative 194 pIm adding scripts to an SSDT project to manage the additionupdate of data from static data tables.

Negative 194 pXmlBeans provides access to XML schema traversal via XmlBeans.compileXsd.  That returns their SchemaTypeSystem, which allows convenient high level access to the entire schema.  This is very convenient for code generation e.g. for other languages or for other nonXML representations among other things.p  pFor example, you can do something like...p  precodeSchemaTypeSystem sts  XmlBeans.compileXsdnew XmlObject[]  XmlObject.Factor.parsexsdFile , XmlBeans.getBuiltInTypeSystem, null codepre  pYou can then drill down into the SchemaTypeSystem to get at everything you need to know about he schema.p  pIs there something within JAXB or any of the other standard Java tooling that provides equivalent functionality  I dont simply want a DOM tree representing the schema.p  pMostly, I dont want to have to drag XMLBeans into a project that is currently relying on JAXB.p

Negative 194 pI have a strange issue that I cant wrap my head around.  I am trying to create an export to csv function for my MVC4 application where the relevant JSON is passed via an ajax call to my ActionResult.  The ActionResult deserializes the stringifyd JSON with JSON.Net, writes it to a file in csv format, then returns the server path to the new file.  My success callback then receives the path and calls the url to download.p  pThis works fine locally, but on my live test server I get the following exception p  pcodeA circular reference was detected while serializing an object of type System.Reflection.RuntimeModule.codep  pThe JSON and subsequently the objects they are deserialized to are slightly complex.  They come from a grouped subset of a SlickGrid DataView.  I was getting circular reference exceptions when I included the aggregate information for column totals this is only relevant to those that are versed in SlickGrid, I do not believe the data being passed to the server is an issue, but Ive removed them before passing the JSON to the server.  Here is my JSON to C class structurep  precode[Serializable] public class Row      public int id  get set      public DateTime DateCreated  get set      public int RefNo  get set      public string ClientName  get set      public string Plate  get set      public string Address1  get set      public int ProductID  get set      public string Product  get set      public string S1  get set      public string S2  get set    [Serializable] public class RootReportObject      public bool group  get set      public int level  get set      public int count  get set      public string value  get set      public string title  get set      public int collapsed  get set      public ListltRowgt rows  get set      public object groups  get set      public string groupingKey  get set   codepre  pThe only thing that Im thinking is that, because of the way the data is structured, the Listlt of rows in the root object may be throwing the circular references during deserializtion because a group does not necessarily have unique row references.p  pMy question is why does it work fine locally  I have no idea what Im missing.p

Is this possiblep  pThe ClassXml and ClassText Execute methods are invoked, which in turn invokes the base class functionality which calls the appropriate print.p  precode   using System      namespace ConsoleApplication1              internal class Program                      public class ClassA                              public string Xml                                      get  return xml                                             public class ClassB                              public char Text                                      get  return t                                             public interface IReturnArgsltout Tgt                              string Name  get set                  T Source  get                            public class ReturnArgsltTgt  IReturnArgsltTgt                 where T  class                              public string Name  get set                   private T source                  public T Source                                      get  return source  source  T Activator.CreateInstancetypeof T, new object[]                                              private static void Mainstring[] args                              var classA  new ReturnArgsltClassAgt                 var classB  new ReturnArgsltClassBgt                  var xml  new ClassXml                 xml.ExecuteclassA                  var text  new ClassText                 text.ExecuteclassB                  Console.ReadKey                           public abstract class ClassBase                              public void ExecuteIReturnArgsltobjectgt args                                       Do something common to both classes e.g. run tasks etc not shown                      calls print when completed, each call specific to child class.

Negative 194 pMy application uses multiple approximately 128 TextBlocks for its UI  think a board of sticky notes. The Text of this TextBlock gets bound to the underlying model. For the majority of the TextBlocks this works fine, however every now and then the text is simply not showing on screen. p  pIve not found a consistent pattern when the text shows and when not, it seems completely random. Ive verified the bindings and the data seems fine, the text has indeed the value of the data bound it.

Negative 194 pI am new to SDLSDL2, with little experience in CC, some with pygame, pyglet and PySide, and now I am trying PySDL2 in hope to find faster a hrefhttpprocessing.orgtutorials relnofollowProcessinga alternative. Processing is for drawing, but there is a straightforward a hrefhttpwww.processing.orgtutorialspixels relnofollowAPI for direct pixel worksa.p  pI started with PySDL2 just yesterday and spent whole day writing boilerplate code to implement simple fire algorithm. Some may laugh at it  just a day  but I think it is important for graphics library that you can draw something with it in a day. My problem is poor CC experience and relevant PySDL2 API is a hrefhttppysdl2.readthedocs.orgenlatestfaq.htmlusing relnofollowmostly direct mapping to C APIa, so it is inherently hard to dig through all the gory details of C based terminology and specifics. I gave up to find a simple overview about the graphics pipeline of SDL2.p  pThe stronggraphics pipelinestrong is a path how bytes andor integers end up being pixels on the screen. Just for example, a high level picture for OpenGL is here  a hrefhttpduriansoftware.comjoeAnintrotomodernOpenGL.Chapter1TheGraphicsPipeline.html relnofollowhttpduriansoftware.comjoeAnintrotomodernOpenGL.Chapter1TheGraphicsPipeline.htmla  and I am looking for more detailed picture of pipeline in SDL2.p  pThe main difficulty with understanding how pixel are drawn in SDL2 is that SDL2 API provides useful helpers that hide this low level details.  Like you load bitmap and get surface. Then you move surface to texture. Then SDL2 somehow moves texture to video memory. Then tells GPU to show it on screen. This is not how I understood it, but there is no link I can give you where it was mentioned. So, it isp  precode[data array] gt [pixel array] gt [surface] gt [texture] gt [video memory]                                                                                    ..made with uglihunds ascii editor..                           [screen]  lt      which haz no graphics pipeline codepre  pAnd for my application this should run 25 times each second. As I write it in Python I really need to know the pipeline to decide where to optimize. But I am not sure the pipeline is correct and I am a little lost inside API  there are many helpers and I dont know even have a starting point how my calculated pixel data may and should look like.p  pSo I need to knowp  ol liwhat are kinds of input data that SDL2 supports bmp, memory pointer, etcli liis there intermediate data format to which input is transformedli liwhat is the data transformation chainli lihow the transformation chain is controlledli lipwhat are kinds of output that SDL2 supportspli lipHow it should look like in PySDL2pli ol  pThere is also a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions20791295sdl2surfacetexturerenderthis questiona downvoted by someone, which tells me that I am not alone in my confusions.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAs noted by Ancurio, surface object in already an array of pixels and array of data, so I am changing the diagram and provide definition that strongsurface is a pixel arraystrong.p  precode[bitmap]  [int array] gt [surface] gt [texture] gt [video memory] gt [screen] codepre  pSo, basically the surface is 1. continuous memory chunk with pixel data, 2. information about the pixels. strongbitmap is a also a pixel arraystrong, which you load from disk or from image. But SDL2 can not use it directly. Whyp  pThe question for the first step of pipeline is how int and bitmap pixels are transformed into surface pixels, and how surface is different from bitmap I am using Python where is no obvious direct memory access and I need to figure out what are my options.p

Negative 194 pFor easing billing I want to use a different AWS account for each cost center. But we want all the services to run inside the same VPC. This is both because different services may need to communicate with each other and there are a limited number of hardware VPN connections available. So the question is how can you make your VPC available to other AWS accounts that you own so they can launch instances inside of itp  pThe infrastructure team has an AWS Account A. The VPC is present on this account and is billed to the infrastructure team for the NAT instance and the VPN gateway. The team on a project has an account B. The instances need to be launched and billed to this account.p  pIve been reading the resources here a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comIAMlatestUserGuidedelegationcrossacctaccess.html relnofollowhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comIAMlatestUserGuidedelegationcrossacctaccess.htmla . It seems as if I can use AssumeRole as Account B to grant access across accounts, but then as far as I can tell my identity changes to the Account A The owner field had the number for Account A. Resourcebased policies seem like what Im thinking but they are not supported for VPCs.p  pIm assuming there has to be some way to do this. Otherwise it doesnt make any sense to have an owner field with an AWS account number for EC2 instances and other resources.p

Negative 194 pSo, Im working on a web services project.p  pBasically, it boils down top  ol liPLSQL side uploads a PDF file, then Base64encodes this file, then sends it to my REST webservice.li liJava webservice receives the file. I save this file before doing anything else just for a test as expected, the file is corrupt its a Base64string, this is normal.li liJava webservice Base64decodes the file and then proceeds to do whatever it needs to do with the file. I save the file once again after this decoding, and once again it works as expected and Im able to open and read the PDF.li liPLSQL now requests to redownload the file. I reencode the file and send it back to the requestor. I save the file after encoding, and as expected its Base64 encoded again it doesnt work corrupt.li liPLSQL receives the file, Base64decodes the file and tries to open it... Bam, corrupt, unable to read the file.li ol  pProbably something is wrong between the communication its Base64encoded in Java, Base64decoded in PLSQL. Youd suspect thered be no difference as its using a standard I guess Base64 is standard, right.p  pWe tried both options after I reencode the PDF in Java, I try to once again redecode it and save it this file is correct and Im able to read the PDF. So wed suppose the encoding in Java is correct. We also tried this in PLSQL  upload a BLOB, encode to Base64, decode it back, download and open. This also works. So wed suppose the encoding and decoding part in PLSQL works, too.p  pWhat is weird is that I can Base64 encode the file in PLSQL, then decode it in Java, then save and read it. It only goes wrong when I reencode the file in Java and try to decode it in PLSQL. So that sounds to me like there cant really be a problem between standards used in PLSQL  Java, because then the first step would fail too.p  pWere using the commons library in Java codeorg.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64code.

This is achieved by setting the Active node value to false. Whether the record exists on QBO V3 or not the response that the API returns is Response Code 200 but the record is still set to Active  true and not the expected value of false. This is telling me that there is a bug with QBO V3 and it does not set the List Name entity record Active node to false.p  pOn the other hand, when I try to set a record Activetrue to an existing record on QBO V3 that is set to Activefalse I get the Response Code 400 that throws a business rule.p  pIn conclusion, I am not sure if the intention is to allow soft deletes or not I would now have to come up with a work around to deal with soft deletes on my application.p

Negative 194 pCurrently PostgreSQL 9.2.4 is provided in OSX Mavericks.  I have used the provided PostgreSQL since running Lion Server.

I would like to change the password for postgres.  Im not sure since the databases were created by postgres that once I change that password if the password will work for the databases or if I will have to change the database passwords also.p  pAll the solutions dealing with this reference directories that I do not have in Mavericks.  When I used Lion and Mountain Lion I was able to go to the psql directory and find postgresql.conf and pghba.conf.  I do a search on those files and do not find them.p  pSidebar I currently use PgAdmin3 for basic database maintenance.  The Mac version of the software does not have an option for changing passwords that I can find.  If there is another GUI software package that is more user friendly for accessing the provided PostgreSQL I would definitely like to try it.  Every solution that suggests Homebrew is in the context of installing another version of PostgreSQL which is not what I want to do.p  pI need the correct terminal commands to do this or help on where to go to get the solution that will work with OS X Mavericks.  The PostgreSQL documentation is a bit overwhelming and was not clear as to where to go and what to do regarding this.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATE 45 603 pm CDTstrongp  pHere are the contents in LibraryServerPostgreSQLDatapghba.confp  precode TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD   local is for Unix domain socket connections only local   all             all                                     trust  IPv4 local connections host    all             all             127.0.0.132            trust  IPv6 local connections host    all             all             1128                 trust  Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the  replication privilege. local   replication     postgres                                trust host    replication     postgres        127.0.0.132            trust host    replication     postgres        1128                 trust codepre

Negative 194 pI am using Jenkins as my build environment for a .NETC Windows product. Jenkins Project A compiles the primary source code into artifacts. Project B builds the installer. The artifacts from project A have a different directory structure than what is required to build the installer in Project B.p  pI tried using the a hrefhttpswiki.jenkinsci.orgdisplayJENKINSCopyArtifactPlugin relnofollowCopy Artifact Plugin a to copy from Project A to B, but theres a a hrefhttpsissues.jenkinsci.orgbrowseJENKINS12379 relnofollowknown limitationa where I cant specify a different directory structure for the copy.p  pIm using a NAnt script in Project B to build the installer. I think the next best thing would be to copy the Project A artifacts to where I need them from the NAnt script.

A user installs it and everythings good.p  pI then update to version 2, but the user doesnt update...maybe the phone has been off for some time...p  pThen I come up with version 3.p  pNext time the users phone will update the app, will it go through version 2 and then 3, or will heshe get version 3 at once from 1p  pI need to know because my app relies on features that I have released in previous versions.p  pThanks in advancep

Im not sure how much of it I can post because its not my code, but it seems to work fine in other Controllers for the project Im working on, and the change in errors after adding the Dispose function to the contoller makes me think this is an issue with the way I implemented IDispoable.p  pStepping through with debugger I see that the context is getting disposed embetweenem the time that it is created in the Controller constructor and that time that the repository method is actually entered. Like when execution leaves scope of controller context is disposed. Is this how Dispose method works And if so do I need to remove Dispose implementation from my constructorp

Negative 194 pI have a UITableViewController with a UISearchBar and UISearchDisplayController. That exists inside a Container View in a UIViewController which is in a UINavigationController.

Negative 194 pIm trying to make a game which involves moving pieces by dragging and dropping them from square to square. However, Im trying to do so using buttons with labels as an exercise. So, for instance, a button with the label W should change its label to  blank when I press the mouse on it and release on a second valid button one with another blank label. Then that second button should change its label from  blank to W.p  pUsing graphics in Java is entirely new to me. Suffice it to say, Im not sure how to accomplish the aforementioned task.

Negative 194 pSo Ive been programming for a year but this concept still trips me up sometimes. My understanding is that if you dont initialize and allocate a new object when you create a new variable name using the pointer operator  that the danger is that the value of that new variable will always just be tied to whatever memory address it is youve pointed the name. For example, in 2 if string is set to 6 because array[1] is set to 6 but later the value of element 1 in array changes to 7 then string will return 7. But if I used method 1 where I use a string class method to allocate and initialize a memory address of its own for string then string would stay 6 even if later element 1 is changed to hold a value of 7. Is this right p  pWhats the difference betweenp  precodeNSString string  [NSString stringwithstring array[1]] codepre  pANDp  precodeNSString string   array[1] codepre  pAs a sidenote I have a tough time understanding how this will matter much because if array is immutable then the only way it could be changed is if a new array is initialized and reallocated with a different value for element 1. Also, once my view controller gets popped off of the stack when the user continues to navigate through my app, if it gets called again all of these objects will get recreated from scratch so it usually wont matter. But I just want to make sure I am getting the concept anyways.p

Negative 194 pI try to make a clientserver system in C on a Linux platform. I want to listen on four different ports. Therefore I create four file descriptors, one for each port. Additionally the process binds the fd to the port and starts listen to it. This works fine. Further I use codeselectcode to listen for connections and there I get a problem. In the first run the program waits at select until a client is connected. After I send with telnet a string to the server it continues. But in the second run of the loop the program stops again at select and waits as long as a new client connects. Even if I send a new string via telnet it waits and handles this after a new connection has been established. The example I used is similar to a hrefhttpwww.binarytides.commultiplesocketconnectionsfdsetselectlinux relnofollowthis linka.  Therefore I do not use a timeout.

Negative 194 pI created a custom directive that works similar to Foundations custom dropdown. Basically I create a div and populate it with a ul with the options. Interacting with the div interacts with the actual select in the background. Eveyrthing works great in Chrome. The issue is when I select an option I use jQuery to trigger the change event for the select element. In chrome this in turn triggers the ngchange that is attached to it. For some reason this isnt triggered in Firefox and Safari. I would assume it should work the same as Chrome. I did some further testing and found that the change event DOES fire, but for some reason doesnt trigger Angular to fire its ngChange method. Im at a loss and need to get this done A.S.A.P.

Negative 194 pI need help with controlling a python script. I want to run a script that controls two robots. A routine consists of a series of motions which either move the arm or move the gripper.

What I want is either one of the followingp  ol liif and only if the user presses ctrlC, completely exit everything, no questions asked. li liif and only if the user presses ctrlC, return the robots to home position defined in that list of arm poses and then completely exit everything.li ol  pMy main question is, how does ctrlC actually work I thought it would just exit the script but in actuality it still prints stuff and asks for input. A subset of that broad question is, how can I just get the desired behavior completely exit everything when pressing ctrlCp  pI realize this is a clunky way of doing what I need the robots to do, but it is the best way I can think of with my limited knowledge of python.p  pThank you,p  pAdrianp

Negative 194 pIve build a small CMS in Codeigniter for a website with a couple of forms. The forms are all submitted with the ajax method in jQuery and passed to the controller. All works fine but I figured it out that I always get a success, no matter if the data is saved in the database or not. The method only checks if the data is passed to the controller properly, i guess. On success there is a message for the user Saved, this will fire everytime, no matter what happens behind the scenes. How I can force success or done, or some other callback to get the Saved message only if the data is savedp  pHere is the codep  precodejavascript saveclub.clickfunction      var clubname  input[nameclubname].val     var location  input[namelocation].val     var phone  input[namephone].val      .ajax         type post,         url baseurl  clubssaveclub,         data clubnameclubname,locationlocation,phone1phone1,         successfunctiondata                      input[typesubmit].attrvalue, Saved             input[typesubmit].cssbackgroundcolor, 32c310             input[typesubmit].csscursor, default             .dynamiccontent.loadbaseurl  clubsclubslist                      controller public function saveclub     newdata  array     newdata[clubname]  thisgtinputgtpostclubname     newdata[location]  thisgtinputgtpostlocation     newdata[phone]  thisgtinputgtpostphone     thisgtloadgtmodelmodelsave     thisgtmodelsavegtsaveclubtodbnewdata  codepre

The local address points to where the attribute is on the Entitys stdvector, and the global address is what other objects ping when they want to get access to that Entitys local address.p  pSo if Social is held at global 5, I can send global 5 to the entity, and it would return its local address for Socialp  pCurrently, my architecture conforms quite well to a multithreaded CPU solution, but I plan on moving it to GPGPU.p  pAs of right now, the way global address are stored is through clustering. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPyI0h.png altenter image description herep  pBut, this doesnt work very well on a GPU as you could imagine if I dont have a sparse arrayI would have to store [3] on Node 0,1 which would ruin the entire purpose of this architecturep  pIs there any way to have a sparse array similar to stdmap with C AMP Or am I stuck redesigning my architecturep

Negative 194 pI have an app that utilizes iOS 8s new touch ID usingp  precodeimport LocalAuthenticationLocalAuthentication.h codepre  pBut at startup on an iOS 7, the app crashes. I do not call the touch ID program if it is not running on iOS 8.

Why would the log tell me otherwisep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjhlZu.png altenter image description herep

The reason i have done it this way for a while is because i used the CountryId property to set the initial value of the dropdownlist and CountryName to show the textual value on a different section of the same form.p  pI would like to know how other people are handling situations like thisp
Negative 194 pIm working with a solution on visual studio 2008, .net framework 3.5, windows 7.

Negative 194 pThis is a followon from the Stack Overflow question a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions22895186usingcustomcontrolsinfxmlUsing custom Controls in fxmla, where the subject is how to use a custom subclass of a standard javafx class in fxml. Apologies if the protocol is to add this within the original.p  pI had the exact same requirement to the above so I added the line codeltimport classes.TreeViewWithItems.gtcode to the fxml file. When I opened it in Scene Builder, the Hierarchy pane showed the TreeViewWithItems object within the anchor pane but the icon had a warning triangle across it. The object wasnt shown on the Drawing pane and the Inspector pane on the right had the message Selection contains unresolved reference.p  pI then created a new package and copied the class and fxml file from the question above. In the first instance the fxml file wouldnt open because it said that the following property  codeltAnchorPane.rightAnchorgt65.0ltAnchorPane.rightAnchorgtcode  was p  blockquote   pStatic property rightAnchor does not exist or is readonly.p blockquote  pI remove that statement and tried to open the fxml file again. It opened with the same results as previously, i.e. the object with a warning triangle in the Hierarchy pane, nothing in the Drawing window and the error message in the Inspector pane.p  pI cant find and way of digging deeper in Scene Builder to get more information.p  pIve tried using my custom class in javafx inline code without problem, so Im fairly confident that the problem doesnt lie there.p  pIm using Eclipse Luna as my IDE.p  pCan anyone help resolve thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 194 pAs you probably know, KIF tests can be flaky. Im experimenting with trying to rerun a KIF test if it fails.

Negative 194 pIm puzzled and looking for a way out here. I will appreciate any helpp  pI am sending notifications from a server to Android devices using GCM. In Mysql, I have a User Table UT with user ID, user data and GCM registration ID. I also have a User Notifications Table UNT in which I store the notification types that each user is registered to. This table includes the user ID and the notification type ID.p  pWhen Sending the notification, I need to go through UNT and build an array of all user IDs that are registered to this type of notification. Then I need to go through the UT and get the GCM Registration ID for each user and send the notification.p  pDB designwise, I believe that this is the right way to do it. However, in notification sending, speed is a major issue if I want a million users to get the notification a few seconds after sending it. Going through 2 tables significantly increases the processing time I measured 47 seconds for 1 million users when going through both tables compared to 17 seconds when going through 1 table.p  pThe question is will it be right to store the GCM registration ID also in the UNT so I wont have to go through the UT Again... DB design wise it is incorrect but GCM wise, it might be the best solution. If you know of additional methods to solve this issue, Ill be happy to hear about it.p  pThank youp

Negative 194 pIve got a class that inherits from Panel. It contains a second panel nested inside of it. When controls are added to this control, I actually want them added to the eminnerem panel. The goal here is to draw a special border using the outer panel, but then be able to host controls inside of the inner panel as if it were any other panel.p  pHere is the basic code Im usingp  precodepublic class TestPanel2  Panel      private Panel innerPanel  new Panel      public TestPanel2              this.Controls.AddinnerPanel         this.ControlAdded  new ControlEventHandlerTestPanel2ControlAdded           void TestPanel2ControlAddedobject sender, ControlEventArgs e              if e.Control  innerPanel              innerPanel.Controls.Adde.Control                codepre  pWhen using this control in the Designer, dragging a child control such as a CheckBox into it results in the designer reportingp  precodechild is not a child control of this parent codepre  pMy theory is that the Designer is calling Controls.SetChildIndex or Controls.GetChildIndex for its own purposes, and that is triggering the error. So I tried adding the following property to the classp  precode    public new ControlCollection Controls              get  return innerPanel.Controls       codepre  pWhen I did this, I also changed all internal references of this.Controls to base.Controls. However, this didnt resolve the problem.p  pIs there a way to add a nested panel that automatically receives controls that are dragged into it If I change the code so that the child controls are only added to innerControl at runtime, it works, but the position of the child controls ends up being wrong, so it isnt much of a solution.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pFor whatever it is worth, here is a simplified diagram of what I am trying to do. Im creating a toolkit that will be used by other developers. It is a specialized panel that contains a custom border and title block. Think of it as being functionally similar to a GroupBox control. I want them to be able to drag this specialized panel onto their form, and then add controls to it, all within the Designer. The innerPanel needs to be its own panel so that it is the only region scrolled when scrolling is necessary.p  pimg srchttpcosmicjive.nettempimagesNestedPanel.png alttitle block panel diagramp

Negative 194 pI am trying to wrap my head around how to create a RESTful API with SLIM. I understand REST and I have a good understanding of slim but what I can understand is how to render the correct view templates.p  pThis is a typical REST APIp  precodeappgtgetwines, getWines appgtgetwinesid,  getWine appgtpostwines, addWine appgtputwinesid, updateWine appgtdeletewinesid,   deleteWine codepre  pNow what I dont understand is if all the routes have the same URL how can you render the correct view template. The first strongGETstrong request displays all the wines. The next strongGETstrong displays only the wine with the specified id. Now this is where my understanding falters.

Negative 194 pI apologize if this question already exist but Im not sure what is this called to even search for the correct resources.p  pIm trying to create a tabbed header menu for different groups of people.

The contents of the page is exactly the same pointing to the same url. However, if a visitor accessed the Timetable page from the Student menu tab, when the page loads, the menu should show the navigation menu under the Student tab. Likewise if a visitor accessed the page via Parent tab.p  pOf course, I planned to add colours to the different tabs to further differentiate them, and even further dropdowns on certain items, but Im stuck even at this preliminary stage.p  pCan anyone help enlighten me what is this feature called Any name i could google with. I could read up resources and code it from then on. My searches so far are very disappointing and frustrating p  pThanks much p

Negative 194 pour HFT trading application is developed in Java. We need to convert 8 bytes to a double number but the conversion has to be extremely fast. Remember our latency is under 15 micro second, so conventional java approaches will probably not work for us. Any suggestion would be helpful. Thanks in advancep  p[edit]p  pWe have already worked on few approaches like byetebuffer, nio classes, twiddling approach using shifting etc. However, I would like to reiterate the need to have each operation as fast as possible. Using these forms of conversions are expensive even though they may seem faster as a standalone amp we end up introducing latency into the application. I am seeking outofthebox ideas amp not limited to the APIs provided by Java which any one may have had experience on using bytes in different formats int, double, float, etc. A thought in that direction is probably caching the double value and compare with the bytes received hence eliminating the need to convert.p

I wrote a lambda function based on unzip, triggered by arrival of a file to the xxxzip bucket, which streams the zip file from S3, unzips the stream, and then streams the individual files to the xxxdata bucket. p  pIt works, but I find it is much slower than I expect  even on a test file, zip size about 500k and holding around 500 files, this is timing out with a 60 second timeout set. Does this seem right On my local system running with node it is faster than this. It seems to me that since files are being moved inside Amazons cloud latency should be short, and since the files are being streamed the actual time taken should be about the time it takes to unzip the stream.p  pIs there an inherent reason why this wont work, or is there something in my code that is causing it to be so slow It is the first time Ive worked with node.js so I could be doing something badly. Or is there a better way to do this that I couldnt find with googlep  pHere is an outline of the code BufferStream is a class I wrote that wraps the Buffer returned by s3.getObject into a readStreamp  precodevar aws  requireawssdk var s3  new aws.S3apiVersion 20060301 var unzip  requireunzip var stream  requirestream var util  require util  var fs  requirefs  exports.handler  functionevent, context      var zipfile  event.Records[0].s3.object.key     s3.getObjectBucketSOURCEBUCKET, Keyzipfile,                   functionerr, data                       var errors  0                      var total  0                      var successful  0                      var active  0                      if err                           console.logerror   err                                            else                           console.logReceived zip file   zipfile                          new BufferStreamdata.Body                              .pipeunzip.Parse.onentry, functionentry                                   total                                  var filename  entry.path                                  var inprocess     active   in process                                  console.logextracting   entry.type     filename  inprocess                                   s3.uploadBucketDESTBUCKET, Key filename, Body entry, ,                                            functionerr, data                                                 var remaining     active   remaining                                                if err                                                      if for any reason the file is not read discard it                                                    errors                                                    console.logError pushing   filename   to S3  remaining     err                                                    entry.autodrain                                                                                                else                                                     successful                                                    console.logsuccessfully wrote   filename   to S3  remaining                                                                                                                                                    console.logCompleted,   total   files processed,   successful   written to S3,   errors   failed                          context.donenull,                                                            codepre

Again, these CSS rules run fine in IE 11 via localhost.p  pIve checked everything I know to check Same web browser obviously, same version of IIS on my local machine as on the server IIS 7.5.7600.16385. My application pool settings locally versus remotely are almost the same  the only difference is that on the server, the Load User Profile setting is set to False. On my local machine its set to true.p  pThe only difference that I can see is OS my local box is running Win 7, while the server runs Win Server 2008 R2. I have made sure that all my project files are getting copied to the server correctly.p  pFirefox and Chrome arent experiencing this issue. Is there something else I can check to figure out why this is going onp

Negative 194 pIm writing what should have been a very simple UAC Bypass application in python. After research and analysis, there is an identical DLL Searchorder hijacking vulnerability present in Windows 7, 8, and 8.1.p  pFirst, forget all of the preparation. For example, I have, stored locally, a .cab file with a .dll inside that will launch cmd.exe. The point of this was to write it to a TEMP directory, use WUSA to extract it to the destination folder, and then execute the vulnerable application.p  pThe reason I say forget the preparation is because it hasnt even made it into my list of problems yet. Say the destination program is program.exe. When I doubleclick program.exe, it spawns the CMD like it should. Also, when I open CMD and type program.exe, the same things happens and I get the cmd.exe shell from the hijacked DLL.p  pHowever, onto my issue. Even when I do nothing butp  precodeimport os os.sytemprogram.exe Same thing with subprocess.call and Popen codepre  pI get the ORIGINAL program, NOT the hijacked one. This is very strange because it works correcty when I just double click or execute it through a normal CMD.p  pIs there something Im missing Why would this work in other scenarios but not with python img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE42ej.gif altenter image description here As you can see, same security contexts...

Negative 194 pI have a Rails 3 app that uses rspec for testing and Carrierwave for image uploads. Right now, we have a codeProfilecode model that has several image fields, for example codephoto1code and codephoto2code. p  pMy rspec tests will fail sporadically usually on the CI server, but occasionally on my local machine with an error similar to the followingp  precode FailureError letprofile  createprofile    ActiveRecordRecordInvalid     Validation failed Image cant be blank codepre  pThe codeProfilecode model has images sourced from codeRails.root.joincode, for examplep  precodeIMAGE1  File.openRails.root.joinspecfixturesp1.jpg IMAGE2  File.openRails.root.joinspecfixturesp2.jpg  FactoryGirl.define do   factory profile do     ...     photo1 IMAGE1     photo2 IMAGE2     ...   end end codepre  pBecause these spurious failures occur sporadically and are not easily reproducible, I think the reason this is happening is that sometimes the images are not loaded fast enough when the tests are occuring. They usually occur on the codebuildcode or codecreatecode methods in the spec files, since that is when validations are tested.p  pHow can this architecturecode be changed such that the tests pass Ive taken a look at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma25315883353878this SO answera which proposes using a  NullStorage class that implements the minimum interface for a storage provider. However, while this solution does technically fix the incorrect failures, it means that every method used on the images must be stubbed out, which is tedious and difficult to maintain. Are other people using that solution, or is there a better wayp

Negative 194 pI have an application in MVC 4  C  Visual Studio 2010 SP1. It is to create UI for storing collections of books. The information I want to store are a name of a collection, a date on creation, and the list of books. A number of books is to be added from the database that stores all the books. Actually, another view is to edit books themselves.p  pSo far, I have designed my View such that it shows form fields for name of collection and date on creation. But underneath I included list of all books to be selected.p  pSelecting them in the edit  create view means they are added to collection. I thought I could implement paging  sorting  filtering for the list of books as the number may become too large to show it on one page. My idea is to add PartialView with a list of books. The PartialView can be invoked by codejQuerycode by code.postcode that is trggered by events like clicking on a page number, table column etc. The PartialView would store a page no., a sort criterium, filter criteria in some hidden fields and based on their values it would generate portion of the list. Hidden fields would be updated from the model but would also pass paging  sorting back to action.p  pI run into problem of how to put everything together in POST form. I would like a user to click page numbers while the previously selected books would still be selected. I dont know how to refresh a PartialView and keep books state. I hope it is possible. If not, what would you recommendp  pThanks p  pBelow is my application.p  pThe model of a bookp  precode Entity public class Book      public string Title  get set      public string Author  get set      public DateTime DatePublished  get set   codepre  pViewModelsp  precode BookToSelect view model public class BookToSelect  Book      public bool Isselected  get set       public static IListltBookToSelectgt MapBooksToBooksToSelectIListltBookgt list, bool isselected  false              return list.Selectx gt new BookToSelect  ...          public static IListltBookgt MapBooksToSelectToBooksIListltBookToSelectgt list              return list.Selectx gt new Book  ...

Negative 194 pI am using python with google app engine. Working on Macbook air 2012 with python 2.7.p  pThe problem I have isp  precodeimport logging  logging.infotest  this works before importing crypto  import Crypto  logging.infotest2  this one does not after importing crypto codepre  pHow does crypto change logging and how can I fix it so that I can use logging normally again in my python appp  pUpdate1p  pIt seems that some python errors are also not displayed in the logging from app engine, as well as correct python code also giving a 500 internal server error which is only visible in a browser console when testing the app in localhost.p  pUpdate2p  pI have completely disabled any imports of Python Crypto  which is provide by Google App Engine , and now my logging works correctly, displaying all my own testing logging lines and python errors. This of course does not solve the problem as I need the Crypto module. Using Crypto in this case blocks the ability to test any code because you can not see errors in the logging.p  pUpdate3 p  pTo be clear, I have included the crypto library in app.yaml exactly as instructed by Google App Engine docs. The crypto library itself works fine, the problem is that it breaks logging in my python app engine app.p

Negative 194 pCurrently I am creating a simple user form for adding of new projects into the sheets. However, one problem I am facing now is that I have three different ranges of rows that consist of three different sizes of projects and their details. For example row 1 to 100 consist of big projects details, while row 150 to 250 is medium projects and row 300 to 400 is small project details. Thus by using the combo dropdown list, the user will select big project or medium project or small project.  p  pThereafter, the new project details will be inserted into the new rows found in the sheet, based on the project sizes that they have selected, in the combo box drop down list.  p  pI have the code below to get me started but am not sure how to proceed p  precodePrivate Sub UserFormInitialize With ComboBoxProjSizes     .AddItem Big Project     .AddItem Medium Project     .AddItem Small Project End With  End Sub codepre
Negative 194 pI am making a GUI programmatically and have run into a small question regarding the uicontrol listbox and the data each value or string refers to. I feel this question will best be illustrated with some code. The code at the end of this question illustrates my question.p  pIf you run this example, select all 5 files from the left listbox and press Button1, you will see them go into the right listbox. You can then select 1, or several of the files in the right list box and press Button2 and MATLAB will output the correct files names. All is fine here.p  pIf you close and re run the program, and just select file1, file3, and file5, pressing Button1 will make them go into the right list box again. This is where my problem is If you select all of the files now in the right list box file1, file3, file3, and press Button2, matlab outputs file1, file2, and file3... not file1, file3 and file5 as I would like.p  pNow I understand why this is happening, because in a list box its codevaluecode property starts at 1 and increases, and the underlying data in the Cell codeDataSetcode remains ordered file1 to file5... So codevaluecode 1 2 3 refers to codeDataSet1code codeDataSet2code codeDataSet3code...p  pWhat would be the best way to overcome this problem I would like to add that for my actual GUI the file names might not always be so obviously named.p  precodeclassdef example lt handle      properties         Figure         Button1         Button2         ListBox1         ListBox2          DataSet       end      methods         function obj  example             createobj             makeUpDataobj         end          function createobj             obj.Figure  figurePosition,[300 300 640 640]              obj.Button1  uicontrolStyle,pushbutton,String,Button1,...

Negative 194 pI set some codeNSTextFieldcodes inside my viewbased codeNSTableViewcode to be editable, and to send an action on end editing so when Enter or Tab is pressed, or when the focus is lost. The behavior when hitting Tab is perfect the cell on the right of the current one gets selected and is ready to be edited. Same goes for ShiftTab. When hitting Enter, the field is deactivated but the same row stays selected, which is the normal behavior.  What I want to achieve is a vertical version of what Tab does, with the Enter key. p  pTo be clear Im editing a codeNSTextFieldcode inside my table. I hit Enter. I want the next row to become selected, and the field in the same column that I was editing previously should become activated meaning it turns into an editable codeNSTextFieldcode with its current content highlighted. The action should still be triggered normally, like it would if you hit Tab while editing a cell.p  pIs that possible If yes, how would I proceedp  pI thought about subclassing codeNSTextFieldcode and playing with codekeyDowncode a little, but I think I would then have to use the notification center to trigger a callback that would make the row selection change in my table and the activation of the next table cell. This seems like overkill, and I wouldnt know how to make the latter happen activate the NSTextField for editing.p  pThanksp

Negative 194 pTo start, Im finally posting after battling for a while with this.p  pBasically, Im using Socket.IO to create a messenger for a site im working on. Im having an issue with the timeago plugin displaying NaN years ago as its output.p  pAfter googling around, i see that the timeago plugin requires a pretty specfic date format, or a Java Date object.p  pHeres my code..p  precodesocket.onchat.message, function data    data  JSON.parsedata   if data.hasOwnPropertysystem      toastr[success]data.msg    else      chat.append       ltli classleft clearfixgt        ltspan classchatimg pullleftgt        ltimg srchttpswww.gravatar.comavatardmmampamps40 altUser Avatar classimgcircle width50 gt        ltspangt         ltdiv classchatbody clearfixgt        ltdiv classheadergt        ltstrong classprimaryfontgt  data.nickname  ltstronggt        ltsmall classpullright textmuted time datatime  data.timeSent  gt        ltspan classglyphicon glyphicontimegtltspangt  .timeagodata.timeSent        ltsmallgt        ltdivgt        ltpgt  data.msg  ltpgt        ltdivgt        ltligt          .panelbody.animatescrollTop chat.height      function updateTimes    .time.eachfunction       var time  .timeagothis.attrdatatime     this.htmltime     setIntervalfunction     updateTimes , 3000 codepre  pSo as you can see, each message element appended onto the page has the timeago output, and the original time sent stored in an attribute for my function to update using updateTimes.p  pWhen the message is first received, everything is fine. However when i use the attributes value and pass that to timeago, this is where everything goes wrong.p  pFrom searching around, i thought i might be able to do the followp  precodefunction updateTimes    .time.eachfunction      var time  new Datethis.attrdatatime     this.html.timeagotime     codepre  pAlthough this didnt work either.p  p....Edit....p  pI forgot to mention how im setting the time at first..p  precodevar d  new Date var time  d.getTime codepre  pHopefully this is obvious for someone, unfortunaly my javascript knowledge is lackingp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pOk, so this has now been resolved.p  pSeems you cant pass Date a string, so i had top  pcodevar time  new DateparseIntthis.attrdatatimecodep  pMany thanks to amklosep

Negative 194 pOn my site, there are two fields on the sign in page one for email, one for password.

Negative 194 pI had a a hrefhttpsjenkinsci.org relnofollowJenkinsa server setup on Mac OS environment. It had one buildNumberUpdate job, which makes exactly what its name says. When this job is done, other 8 build jobs are started simultaneouslyactually 3, because thats my executors limit setup. All these jobs checkout the same repo, and build its workspace with different schematarget. p  pThe last step of each job is deploy to iTunesConnect. The problem is that if two builds finish at exactly the same time, iTMSTransporter gives following errorp  blockquote   pCannot proceed with delivery an existing transporter instance is   currently uploading this packagep blockquote  pMy best guess is this is caused by code.tokencode file being already used from lets say JobA, when JobB wants to used it too for uploading. After some research I found this SO topicp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24884261executingmultipleinstancesofitmstransporterExecuting multiple instances of iTMSTransporterProtocolap  pThe guy over there had probably the very same issue and sayed he fixed it by making folder unique. However my folders are already unique, as Jenkins make folder for each separate job. So hes probably talking for making separate folder for each iTMST token, but I do not know how to do that. As far as I know this token on MAC OS is stored herep  blockquote   pUserscodeltusernamegtcode.itmstransporterUploadTokensp blockquote  pIf you know any other possible cause of this error Im eager to discuss them p
