Positive 26050 pIm trying to adjust the origin.y value of a UIViews frame.  The problem that Im running into is that the elements arent moving with the frame with negative offsets.  When I give the origin.y a positive value, it works perfectly the view drops down, leaving black above, and the elements shift down as well.  With a negative value, on the other hand, the view moves correctly, leaving black below, but the elements dont change position.  I feel like the problem might be with autolayout, and the elements remaining trapped by the top of the screen, not the top of the UIView.p  pAny ideas on how to fix thisp

Positive 26050 pAcross my app I have several different subclasses of UIView UIDatePicker, UIPicker, UIButton, UITableView, UITableViewCell, UITextView, etc. etc... For each of these Id like to add a very simple drawRect custom implementation that I have working great.p  pIs there a simple way to get multiple subclasses of UIView to all have the same drawRect implementation without creating a subclass and repeating the same code across each UIPicker, UIButton, etc. etc... p  pI realize the solution to this is probably to write a delegate class for UIViews layer property and do the custom drawing in drawLayer, but I thought I would ask before I go reworking my code.p

But for some reason there are extra constraints for width and height for content size that are actually set to 40.p  pThis is my codeimageViewcodes codedidSetcode method for the codeIBOutletcodep  precodeIBOutlet private weak var imageView UIImageView      didSet          if let widthConstraint  imageView.constraintForLayoutAttribute.Width                      widthConstraint.constant  MinimumImageLength             imageView.layoutIfNeeded                  else                      let widthConstraint  NSLayoutConstraintitem imageView, attribute .Width, relatedBy .Equal, toItem nil, attribute .NotAnAttribute, multiplier 1, constant MinimumImageLength             NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints[widthConstraint]                   if let heightConstraint  imageView.constraintForLayoutAttribute.Height                      heightConstraint.constant  MinimumImageLength             imageView.layoutIfNeeded                  else                      let heightConstraint  NSLayoutConstraintitem imageView, attribute .Height, relatedBy .Equal, toItem nil, attribute .NotAnAttribute, multiplier 1, constant MinimumImageLength              NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints[heightConstraint]                codepre  pWhich gets a width and height constraint if they exist and set its minimum width. As a note, in my view I have explicitly set these width and height constraints and so my code never enters the codeelsecode in both width and height.p  pTo get the right constraint I use the following functionp  precodeextension UIView      func constraintForLayoutAttributelayoutAttribute NSLayoutAttribute gt NSLayoutConstraint              let filteredArray  constraints.filter  0.firstAttribute  layoutAttribute           return filteredArray.first       codepre  pLater on I use the same function to get the widthheight and change both constants. I call codelayoutIfNeededcode after updating the widthheight constraints. Ive also tried debugging by also calling codesetNeedsUpdateConstraintscode with no luck.p  pInterestingly, constraints work as expected if I test by removing the image from the codeUIImageViewcode and just set a background colour so I can see whats happening.p  pDoes anyone know why this might be happeningp

Positive 26050 pI have a codeUITableViewCellcode subclass that Im electing to set all positioning up in its codelayoutSubviewscode method. I have a special view Ive created essentially a view with a codeUILabelcode in it as a subview of this cell, and I want to position it correctly in codelayoutSubviewscode, but I cannot figure out how.p  pEvery other view I calculate what its position should be manually, and then call setFrame. This seems weird with this special view Ive created as its created from a nib and laid out using Auto Layout. But the cell itself doesnt use Auto Layout so Im unsure what to do.p  pConstraintwise the special view with the label in it just has the label positioned 15pt in from each size of the view its contained in. p  pIn codelayoutSubviewscode I want to essentially keep this logic that insets it intact, but make sure in terms of the cell that its positioned and sized properly within the cell. So essentially I want to keep the Auto Layout logic that keeps the label within the special view positioned intact, but allow me to position and size emthe whole view itselfem within the cell using codesetFramecode. Basically a view created from a nib with Auto Layout used inside a cell that elects not to use Auto Layout.p  pI tried basically calling codesizeThatFitsCGSizeZerocode to deduce what size it should be with Auto Layout, then position it, but it returns an absurdly large size that doesnt make sense. Even if I return a manually size, I get constraint conflict warnings in the console that one or more of my Auto Layout constraints for setting up the label within the cell will be ignored.p  pHow should I be doing this How should I make the views subviews respect its Auto Layout system, but allow me to position the cohesive view itself however I pleasep

Negative 26050 pTo understand what Im asking, its important to distinguish from among the several uses of SUID in Unix.p  pI have a project that uses an executable in the users PATH which is owned by the project and which has the SUID bit set. In this way, when it runs, it runs in the context of the files owner, not the calling user. This way, it has access to things that the user does not, and thereby these things are protected from the user by normal file system protections. This works reasonably well. Plans are to move the project to a clientserver architecture but thats going to take some time. In the mean time, how can I replicate this type of behavior on Windows systems p  pNote that the projects executables do not call the SETUID library call though, frankly, that would be a great feature to add, in my opinion, given what the project does. The project does not need system root privileges. Its first security concern is that it needs to protect its own files from the user which is simply any user other than the file owner and it would be very nice if it had the ability to switch to user context to access the file system as if it were the calling user. In this way, it could more easily determine what is OK for the project to touch and what is not.p  pThe project is written in a combination of C and Java  a C program with SUID set calls the Java code...p  pI am keen to know all such mechanisms, and am especially focused on those which arep  ol liSuitable for C and Java, andli liEasy to implement for nonWindows programmers, andli liRequire minimal coding unique to Windows.li ol  pIf some solutions are superior, please share your thoughts on whatever you are aware of in this regard.p  pNOTESp  ol liLogonUser Requires a password in plain text.

Negative 26050 pI am wondering if somebody knows some more details about the time stamp counter in Linux when a context switch occurs Until now I had the opinion, that the TSC value is just increasing by 1 during each clock cycle, independent if in kernel or in user mode. I measured now the performance of an application using the TSC which yielded a performance result of 5 Mio Clock Cyles. Then, I made some changes to the scheduler which means that a context switch takes considerably longer, i.g. 2 Mio cycles instead of 500.000 cycles. The funny bit is, that when measuring the performance of the original application again it still takes 5 Mio cycles... So I am wondering why it did not take considerably longer as a context switch takes now almost 2 Mio clock cyles more and there occur at least 3 context during execution of the application.p  pIs the time stamp counter somehow deactivated during kernel mode Or is the content of the TSC saved during contest switches Thanks if someone could point me out what could be the problemp

Negative 26050 pA typical situationp  pIn my GridView control, I have a Footer row which contains a Textbox and an Add Button. When the button is pushed, the Text entered in the TextBox is added to the grid. I also have a validation control to require that, when the button is pushed, that text has been entered in the TextBox. After a new row is added, the textbox is clear to allow for easy entry of the next item.p  pThe user may also edit the text in previously entered rows by clicking the Edit LinkButton, which puts the row into edit mode. Clicking an Update LinkButton commits the change.p  pThe problemp  pWhen, I click the Update link to commit the changes, if text has not been entered in the Footer rows TextBox the row used to add a new entry, the validation control returns a Entry Required error. It should only require an entry if the Add button is pushed, not if the Update LinkButton is pushed.p  pIt seems that the server side Validation controls validating event fires before the GridViews RowCommand event or the btnAddClick event, so I am wondering how, from the server, I can determine what event fired the postback so I can determine whether what edits should be performed for the given situation.p  pI am using a mix of client side required validation edits as well as more complex server sides. Since I probably have to have some server sided validations, I would be happy with just knowing how to handle server sided validations, but really, know how to handle this situation for client validations would also be helpful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 26050 pLets say I have an SSL secured domain at secure.domain.com.p  pI also have a web application using silverstripe at www.domain.com and another at app.domain.com using CakePHPp  pI would like specific areas of www.domain.com and app.domain.com to utilize SSL, and thus must somehow rewrite the paths using the subdomain with the installed SSL certificate.p  pSo for example, secure.domain.comss should rewrite to www.domain.com and similarly, secure.domain.comapp should rewrite to app.domain.com.p  pThe challenge, however, is that both www.domain.com SilverStripe and app.domain.com CakePHP have their own complex rewrite rules, and I cant seem to build an htaccess script that successfully retains the functionality of the respective applications...p  pFYI Assume I have the directory structure publichtml and webroots assigned to the apps as follows www.domain.com  publichtmlsubdomainswww app.domain.com  publichtmlsubdomainsapp secure.domain.com  publichtmlsubdomainssecurep  pHas anyone accomplished something similar to this beforep

Negative 26050 pI already wrote here about the http chat server I want to create a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2352220alternativehttpporthttpstackoverflow.comquestions2352220alternativehttpporta This http server should stream text to every user in the same chat room on the website. The browser will stay connected and wait for further html code. yes that works, the browser wont reject the connection.p  pI got a new question Because this chat server doesnt need to receive information from the client, its not necessary to listen to the client after the server sent its first response. New chat messages will be send to the server on a new connection. So I can open 2 threads, one waiting for new clients or new messages and one for the html streaming. Is this a good idea or should I use one thread per client I dont think its good to have one threadclient when there are many chat users online, since the server should handle multiple different chats with their own rooms.p  p3 posibilities 1. One thread for all clients, send text to each client successive  there shouldnt be much lag since its only text this will be like user1.sendtextuser2.sendtext,... 2. One thread per chat or chatroom 3. One thread per chat user  ... many...p  pThank you, I havent done much with sockets yet .p

Negative 26050 pWith several forms of mine, I occasionally run into the following issue I edit the form using the designer Visual Studio 2008, Windows Forms, .NET 2.0, VB.NET to add components, only to find out later that some minor adjustments were made e.g. the forms size is suddenly changed by a few pixels, and controls get deleted. This happens silently  eventhandling methods automatically have their codeHandlescode suffix removed, too, so they never get called, and theres no compiler error. I only notice much later or not at all, because Im working on a different area in the form.p  pAs an example, I have a form with a codeSplitContainercode containing an Infragistics codeUltraListViewcode to the left, and an codeUltraTabControlcode to the right. I added a new tab, and controls within, and they worked fine. I later on found out that the list views scrollbar was suddenly invisible, due to its size being off, and at least one control was removed from a different tab that I hadnt been working on.p  pIs this a known issue with the WinForms Designer, or with Infragistics I use version control, of course, so I can compare the changes and merge the deleted code back in, but its a tedious process that shouldnt be necessary. Are there ways to avoid this Is there a good reason for this to occurp  pOne clue is that the control that was removed may have code such as a codeLoadcode event handler that expects to be run in run time, not design time, and may be throwing an exception. Could this cause Visual Studio to remove the controlp

In the method codebarcode, the block doesnt behave.p  precodeclass Order lt ActiveRecordBase      def foo     p self.class.name  prints Order       The self inside the block passed to the each method      points to an object of type Order as expected      This is the normal block behavior.     [1,2,3].each do val       p self.class.name  prints Order     end   end     def bar      p self.class.name  prints Order       the self inside the block passed to the search method      points to an object of type SunspotDSLSearch.      This is NOT the normal block behavior.      Order.search do       keywordshello       p self.class.name  prints SunspotDSLSearch     end end codepre  pstrongNote2strongp  pI have located the code in Sunspot source tree that modifies the normal block behavior. My question is about the reason for rigging the binding like this.p  pstrongNote3strongp  pSpecifically, I found an issue while invoking the codeidcode method in side the block. The codesearchcode method delegates the method invocation inside the block to the DSL object and if it doesnt find the method then call is redelegated to the calling context. Search method strips all but the essential methods from the DSL object before registering delegation code. The codeidcode method is not stripped out. This is causing the problem. For all the other methods delegation works fine.p  pThis behavior is not documented in the Sunspot method documentation. p

Negative 26050 pSo this is the dumbest thing Ive struggled with in awhile.

It needs to serve two purposes to flag a yesno value 10 in the POST data, and ideally trigger an action on the page using JSjQuery. Im having trouble with the latter.p  pThe default state is No if I click Yes I can retrieve an onchange or onclick event state and make something happen. However, this is a oneway switch I cannot retrieve a state going back to the No selector once Ive gone to Yes. What I need to be able to do is show  hide an element on the page depending on what choice theyve made in this radio set. If I click Yes, I can trigger the action and see the page change. Once I click No, however, it acts as if there was no state change and I cannot perform an action i.e. hide the element again.p  pIve tried variations on retrieving the checked state, the radio pair value, etc, e.g.p  precodecompleteSw.changefunctione     alert this.attrchecked   only triggers when Yes is selected  codepre  pPerhaps I should not be using a yesno radio pair, but instead be using a single checkbox Seems more userfriendly and elegant this way radio buttons to me.p

Negative 26050 pIm trying to understand the hazards of not locking shared variables in a threaded or shared memory environment. It is easy to argue that if you are doing two or more dependent operations on a variable it is important to hold some lock first. The typical example is the increment operation, which first reads the current value before adding one and writing back.p  pBut what if you only have one writer and lots of readers and the write is not dependent on the previous value. So I have one thread storing a timestamp offset once every second. The offset holds the difference between local time and some other time base. A lot of readers use this offset to timestamp events and getting a read lock for each time is a little expensive. In this situation I dont care if the reader gets the value just before the write or just after, as long as the reader dont get garbage that is an offset that was never set.p  pSay that the variable is a 32 bit integer. Is it possible to get a garbage read of the variable in the middle of a write Or are writing a 32 bit integer an atomic operation Will it depend on the Os or hardware What a about a 64 bit integer on a 32 bit systemp  pWhat about shared memory instead of threadingp

Negative 26050 pIm building a voting system whereby each vote is captured in a votes table with the codeUserIDcode and the codeDateTimecode of the vote along with an codeintcode of either strong1strong or strong1strong.p  pIm also keeping a running total of codeTotalVotescode in the table that contains the item that the user actually voted on.  This way Im not constantly running a query to codeSUMcode the Vote table.p  pMy Question is kind of a proscons question when it comes to updating the TotalVotes field. With regards to code manageability, putting an additional update method in the application makes it easy to troubleshoot and find any potential problems. But if this application grows significantly in its user base, this could potentially cause a lot of additional SQL calls from the app to the DB.  Using a trigger keeps it all in the sql family so to speak, and should add a little performance boost, as well as keep a mundane activity out of the code base.p  pI understand that premature optimization could be called in this specific question, but since I havent built it yet, I might as well try and figure out the better approach right out of the gate.p  pPersonally Im leaning towards a trigger.  Please give me your thoughtsreasoning.p

Negative 26050 pI have two MySQL servers configured in a multimaster replication setup.  Each is a slave and master to the other.  My application requires that some large queries be ran in the background, and the results of these queries would be used to populate a table.

This way, the application wouldnt be slowed while the server is running these queries.p  pThese queries are very large codeINSERT .... SELECTcode.  With my replication setup, it seems that when one server finishes the query, instead of just sending the INSERTs to the slave, it has the slave run the original large INSERTSELECT.p  pIs this actually happening  Or is there a way to see what commands were sent to the slave from the master to verify this is the behavior  The only way I can tell is from CPU load.p  pIs there a way for the slave to only get the resulting INSERT from an INSERT...

Negative 26050 pI am working with JFreeChart in order to show a Histogram Chart. My idea is to create a chart with 10 double bars, one bar of the pair in a different color. The 10 values will correspond to 10 weeks, so every week I will have 2 bars representing two different datasets. p  pFor this purpose I tried with class BarChart, and it works, but I am not able to asign different colors to each dataset.p  pIf anybody could help with assigning different colors to each bar it would be great. Maybe another class is more suitable than BarChartp
Negative 26050 pI have a quite complicated request scoped JSF 1.2 managed bean with various methods and properties. Some of the properties are mapped to URL request parameters so that it can populate an entity object according to the id attribute in the URL.p  pI use the same managed bean both to create a new record for that entity using one jsf page, and another one for updating a couple of fields. In create mode, there are no url parameters, and submitting the form using an  specifying an action method just does what its told and executes the method. p  pBut when in update mode, getting the entitys id from the request parameter in the URL which populates the form perfectly with the entity data pulled from the database, the submit button i.e. the  does not invoke the action method on the same managed bean, but reloads the page with the url parameters gone and with the form blank this time since theres no id in the url, the id property which is used when referring to the corresponding data by a service class method to set the entity object is null.p  pSo how would I get that method executed in this updatemode as I call itp  pListening to an advice, I had also included hidden fields which contain the values of id parameters obtained from the URL in the update form, which didnt seem to work.p  pHeres the code fragment containing the form in the problematic JSF pagep  precodelthform idostOnayFormgt     lthmessages stylecolorred gt          lthinputHidden valueoduncStokTalepBean.viewID gt         lthinputHidden valueoduncStokTalepBean.adimID gt          lthpanelGrid idoracleERP columns3                 renderedoduncStokTalepBean.aksiyon.faz3gt                 Personel dn cari kodu          lthinputText idcarikod valueoduncStokTalepBean.oduncCariKod                     requiredtrue                     requiredMessageBu personelin dn cari kodunu girmelisiniz.

Negative 26050 pI find a interesting problem when working with web service in JSON format.p  pAssume theres web service. accept several parameters. each parameter has different value set. You can get the response by passing different request parameters.p  pThe request is in JSON format. Because therere so many different combination of request parameters. For performance optimization, I want to cache the request and response pair. and store it into local database.

Is it possible to store requestresponse as keyvalue pair in these kind of database So I can cache the result and response to user immediately.   p  pThank you.p

When I scroll it out of sight and back, it is gone and I need to retain it somehow.

The code for drawing the grid is in drawRect and the color is set as grayColor.  When the program starts, the visible grid is the lighter color, but its darker on the parts of the canvas revealed when I scroll.  I think it has to do with drawRect being called, causing it to redraw the grid, but I dont know why it darkens the strokes as their opacity should be 1.0 already.  Also, if I scroll the original frame away completely and go back, the grid is darker there as well.pli lipIs there a way for me to draw the grid at the beginning of the program thats not in drawRect so it doesnt get redrawn  I tried in awakeFromNib and initWithFrame, even with lockFocus, but it didnt work.

Negative 26050 pI have a .NET 3.5 Windows Service. Im testing with a small application that just sleeps threads after starting them, for random timespans of 300 to 6500ms.

Im not exactly sure how much it is a problem for me that the threads would last somewhere between half a second and a few seconds. Is this reason enough to look somewhere elseli liAm I best off just creating the background threads myselfli ol  pThe reallife service will poll the database for a list of pending requests, execute threads for each of those requests limited to a certain amount of concurrent threads and each thread will be checking if some data exists in a database, retrieve it if it does, or download it from a streaming API, store it, and return that data. The downloading would be the part that consumes the most time.p  pI would really like this question to be answered for .NET 3.5 Framework, but if there are better or more efficient ways to accomplish this under .NET 4.0, I would like to read about them too.

The third jobs deploys the war file to the QampA server.p  pEach job produces a new war file, which bothers me for two reasonsp  ol liEven though only the needed goals are executed, e.g. no tests when deploying to QampA, the build still takes a little too long, as the WAR file has lots of files in it.li liWe rely on the build number from Jenkins to find out which build the artifact is from. Up till now it was the number from the fast job, but now it is the number from the qadeploy job.li ol  pHow can I configure Jenkins andor Maven to reuse the artifacts from the first jobp  pId prefer a solution which does not change the overall project structure, as our project has a single war module, and splitting it means more work in documenting the changes and it is simpler to have everything in once place.p

Negative 26050 pI have a very subtle problem with XNA, specifically the SpriteBatch. In my game I have a Camera class. It can Translate the view obviously and also zoom in and out. I apply the Camera to the scene when I call the Begin function of my spritebatch instance the last parameter.p  pThe Problem When the cameras Zoomfactor is bigger than 1.0f, the spritebatch stops drawing. I tried to debug my scene but I couldnt find the point where it goes wrong.p  pI tried to just render with Matrix.CreateScale2.0f as the last parameter for Begin. All other parameters were null and the first SpriteSortMode.Immediate, so no custom shader or something. But SpriteBatch still didnt want to draw.p  pThen I tried to only call DrawString and DrawString worked flawlessly with the provided scale 2.0f.p  pHowever, through a lot of trial and error, I found out that also multiplying the ScaleMatrix with Matrix.CreateTranslation0, 0, 1 somehow changed the safe value to 1.1f. So all Scale values up to 1.1f worked. For everything above SpriteBatch does not render a single pixel in normal Draw calls. DrawString still unaffected and working.p  pWhy is this happening I did not setup any viewport or other matrices. It appears to me that this could be some kind of strange NearFarclipping. But I usually only know those parameters from 3d stuff.p  pIf anything is unclear please askp

Negative 26050 pI am reviewing this technology but have a few design concerns that made me pause a few times. Can someone help straighten me upp  p1 Inside the workflow all variables are either global or activity scoped. If you want to bind them to inputoutput argument of an activity, then they will need to be globally scoped. And we all have dealt with managing long lasting, globally scoped variables.p  pMy other fear is that there is great temptation with such globally scoped variables that these activity can be rearranged with little consequence, when in fact they cant be. p  pAlso that each activity must be aware of who is settingmodifying their input values, which is actually an alias to the globally scoped variables, violating the Tell dont ask principle.p  p2 Unit Testing, I can see how each activity can be tested, but I am not seeing how the workflow as a whole can be tested yet. Eg. How am I supposed to simulate the workflow sending an email when it does not receive an input from a user after 30 days However, Im not comfortable leaving Unit Test out of the picture entirely, since the workflow is after all a branching logic, hence complex, hence the potential for error is too great to ignore.p  p3 The whole workflow foundation looks so heavily coupled ie. its persistence  workflow  expression tree builder kinda. I wished it were a little more elegant somehow like the reactive framework Rx, but I gotta humbly admit, I dont know a betterfaster way of doing things for long running processes. p  pSo in conclusion, finite state machine is usually complex. Especially with feature creeps yeah seriously think about covariant and contravariant etc. and more so on long running processes. Im fine with using FSM for things that rarely change eg. the C compiler, but for something that is supposed to be fluid rather than rigid like your average business requirement, I fear that there is great temptation to abuse it and thereby making the code unmaintainable. However, workflow in a business process is just so critical, it is hard to pass up on the technology.p  pAm I just too defensive Whats your take How can I avoid the pitfallsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 26050 pI have a method inside one of my classes to my Java application that makes a Swing GUI and has its own action listeners  which works fine. However, when the window is closed  I need the method to return a codeString[]code array this is the part that is causing the problems...p  pI have added a simple codereturncode statement at the end of the method, but obviously Java doesnt wait for the action listeners and thinks that the method is complete once the action listeners have been  added. So is there any way to emholdem a method, and then resume it when I am ready   or even, a different solution to my problemp  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 26050 pI have inherited a Java project which includes a number of classes that are not named according to the UpperCamelCase naming convention. p  pThis is particularly the case with abbreviations e.g. HTMLButton rather than HtmlButton. Whilst I know there are some differences of opinion on the use of CamelCase with abbreviations, we would like to switch to only using a capital letter for the first letter of the abbreviation. Currently, there appear to be several simultaneous naming conventions.p  pId like to tidy this up. Were using Mercurial as our source code repository and working on Windows machines including XP, Vista, 7. However, if I change a class name from HTMLButton to HtmlButton, Mercurial recognises this as a class name change, but not as a file name change. And subsequently any pulls from Mercurial dont pick up the file name change.p  pI know that Windows works on a caseinsenstive file system, and I understand that Mercurial picks up on this feature when accepting pushes from a Windows box...p  pSo...  Is there a setting I can change to get Mercurial to use casesensitive file names  Is there a setting I can change to get Windows to use casesensitive file names These are separate questions. My priority is to get Mercurial to accept file name changes, if necessary, we can then manually force file renames in our IDE. However, a straightthrough solution would be preferredp  pIf all else fails, I might try renaming HTMLButton to HtmlButtonA, commit and push, and rename HtmlButtonA to HtmlButton, and do another commit and push... However, Im not certain what impact this would have on Windows file names if someone else only did a pull after the second push...p

Negative 26050 pFirst off my background Im new to Java coming over from Ruby. If that helps.p  pIm confused about how layout params work.  Im following a basic Hello World introduction to creating an Android App.  Step 1, extend the Activity class, and the onCreate method to access the XML layout.  Ok I get that.  p  pThen I create a layout say a RelativeLayout in the Main.XML.  So this is making use of the RelativeLayout class which extends the ViewGroup class, ok so far.  Then lets say I create a button inside this.  This is where my question starts.  If I look at the example I am following I see attributes being assigned to the button that belong to the RelativeLayout class i.e androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue.  These seem to be the layout params.  But why does this work  The button class seems to inherit from the View class.  Why can a button object accept attributes for the RelativeLayout object  Maybe my Ruby programming is confusing me..p  pThanksp  pUpdate For posterity sake thank you to Slothsberry for pointing out the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuideclaringlayout.html relnofollowXML Layoutsa link, which seems to describe the answer clearly in 2 sections the section on Attributes and on Layout Paramters.  The attributes section reads  p  blockquote   pEvery View and ViewGroup object supports their own variety of XML   attributes. Some attributes are specific to a View object for   example, TextView supports the textSize attribute, but these   attributes are also inherited by any View objects that may extend this   class. Some are common to all View objects, because they are inherited   from the root View class like the id attribute. And, other   attributes are considered layout parameters, which are attributes   that describe certain layout orientations of the View object, as   defined by that objects parent ViewGroup object.p blockquote  pThe layout parameters section though is perhaps the section that really answers this question.  Where it states p  blockquote   pEvery ViewGroup class implements a nested class that extends   ViewGroup.LayoutParams. This subclass contains property types that   define the size and position for each child view, as appropriate for   the view group. As you can see in figure 1, the parent view group   defines layout parameters for each child view including the child   view group.p blockquote  pThey give a nice diagram as well.  It seems that a beginning programmer needs to recognize that while Java classes are referenced, the XML acts more like a CSS sheet and that attributes are first computed in a nested fashion before being computed and carried over to their Java class counterparts.  Thats my current understanding anyways p

Negative 26050 pbr I just started using the a hrefhttpeclipse.orgmat relnofollowEclipse Memory Analyzera to try to solve a memory leak in my activity that extends MapActivity, but I am not sure if I understand its output correctly. In order to analyze the leak I started the activity and rotate the screen a couple of times and then I took a heap dump and opened it. The first thing I did was opening the a hrefhttpimageshack.usf847leak1.png relnofollowHistogram viewa  and look for my activity called ChangeLocationActivity. This looks indeed like a memory leak, since there are three instances of the same Activity. So I got the list of objects with incoming references, then got the Path to GC Roots excluding weak references for all the three instances. a hrefhttpimageshack.usf4leak2a.png relnofollowThisa is the path of the first instance, a hrefhttpimageshack.usf215leak3.png relnofollowthisa for the second instance that custom MyLocationOverlay is a really simple class created to bypass a bug on some Motorola devices and it doesnt anything special apart from catching an Exception in drawMyLocation and finally a hrefhttpimageshack.usf819leak4.png relnofollowthisa is the one for the third instance, which looks like the one currently shown.p  pAs I said before I am not sure if I understand these results correctly the Eclipse Memory Analyzer is really powerful but quite complex but from what I can tell it looks like whats causing  the memory leak is something related to the Google Maps library. Can anyone tell me if I am right or if Im just not understanding these resultsp

Negative 26050 pIve found several answers to this question, but each case was different from mine. Before I spend hours implementing what I think will work, Id like to get an opinion or two. Who knows, there may be an easier solution that will benefit someone else toop  pIm in the process of creating a website which provides a photo modification service. Each of my customers will be uploading their photos using a modified version of a jQueryPHP upload script I found on Github a hrefhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUpload relnofollowBlueImps File Uploada script props BlueImp  When each image is done uploading, a thumbnail of the image is displayed next to the images filename.p  pThe upload page creates a folder based on their Order , and a thumbnail subfolder where the images are stored. For example, for Order  12345p  puploads12345  lt  Folder where the uploaded images will gop  puploads12345thumbs lt  Folder where thumbnails will be served fromp  pIts important that clients dont access other clients photos. I moved the uploads folder outside of my website root, but then the thumbnails werent displaying when the images finished uploading because, well, they werent in the website root so the links werent working.p  pHeres a solution I thought ofp  pSeparate the folders. Move the main upload folder outside of the document root, but leave the thumbnail folder inside the doc root, so the thumbnails can be served up when each upload completes. When the user has finished uploading their images, delete the thumbnail folder corresponding to that Order .p  pIs there a better way to do it My concern is preventing access to photos A client will only have to upload them once, then wait for us to finish the modifications. They will NOT have to log back in to download them.  I dont want someone to be able to access the upload folder via the address bar or anywhere else.  Can I use an .htaccess file to restrict access, but still allow for linking to the thumbnail images via the upload scriptp  pI apologize for the wordy question.  I tried to be as succinct as my limited knowledge of programming would allow.  Thank you in advance for your time and effort in helping with this.p

Negative 26050 pIm using PHPUnit 3.6.7, PHPCodeCoverage 1.1.1, and Xdebug 2.1.2. When I have PHPUnit write my code coverage statistics to a cloverstyle XML file, it occasionally shows a closecurlybrace as not being covered by tests.p  pI see a lot of discussion online of when PHPUnit is reaching the close curlybraces, but I dont understand the general concept of whats going on. For example, I have zero coverage on one line herep  precodeif isarrayfoo      foreach foo as bar          if propertyexistsbar, baz              return bar                  this line has 0 coverage return null codepre  pAnd herep  precodeclass Foo      public myProperty     public function myMethod              thisgtmyProperty  1         this line has 0 coverage codepre  pOther classes in my project dont have this problem their closecurlybraces dont show up in the XML file at all, so they are not listed as having zero coverage.p  pI understand that PHPCodeCoverage 1.1.2 not released yet will let me put a  codeCoverageIgnore comment after a close curlybrace, but until thats available I want to know whats going on, so that I can fix my tests to give me complete coverage. Whats the ruleofthumb to tell me when a curlybrace should be counted as covered or not coveredp

Negative 26050 pI would like to find out if my database is running or not from my java code. I am not sure what approach will work best. The most obvious one is to have a thread that periodically polls the database. Another approach would be to use Triggers. I am not well versed in triggers, but i know that you can fire the trigger for updates, inserts and deletes. But, is it possible to fire the trigger when the database is down It makes no sense to me trigger would work when the database is down. p  pPS The database we are using right now is oracle, but I believe the same solution can be applied to any databasep  pThanksp

My question is will batch drawing a single animated sprite be any more efficient than not using batching at all Since there is only one frame drawn at each draw and only one object, I would think not. The only benefit I think would be if you added more than one object  so that they could be drawn at their frame coordinates from the same texture in a single draw. Is my reasoning correctp

Negative 26050 pIm trying to figure out if there is a way to dynamically add controls into another control I know this is a bit vague.... My program is in C 4.0, and WPF.  Basically, Im trying to create a datagrid but as opposed to having normal type cells ie text, hyperlink etc, I need each cell to hold a number of items.  I figured that this wasnt possible in the datagrid, so Im trying to do the following  Using a stack panel, add a variable number of wrap panels. Each wrap panel will contain 7 grids, where each grid will hold the data I want Ill likely use some user control in place of the grid I think...p  pAn example of the code I have so far...p  precode            ltStackPanel Height559 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin24,11,0,0 NametyStackPanel VerticalAlignmentTop Width783gt                 ltWrapPanel Height100gt                     ltGrid Width100 Height100gt                      ltGridgt                 ltWrapPanelgt                 ltWrapPanel Height100gt                  ltWrapPanelgt             ltStackPanelgt codepre  pIs there a way to create a variable number of Wrap Panels though ie like you would have a variable number of rows in a datagridp  pAny help and suggestions is much appreciatedp  pP.S. Figure I should explain what Im trying to achieve a bit better.  I have a collection of items, each with 5 properties that I want displayed together.  These items are grouped by Name like a row in a data column and a column header which is not one of the 5 properties. I want to group the collection by Name, ColumnHeader pairs, and then in each cell display those 5 properties.  In the way Im trying to set it up above, there would be a WrapPanel per Name and a CellGrid contained in  it for each ColumnHeader.p

Negative 26050 pI acknowledge this question as broad and vague, but I would like to know from those with WebUI experience in Java..p  pWhen you get a task to build a web application, like a web site for example, estore what framework is a good start to get in touch with uptodate Java web technologiesp  pThe question is not about which framework is better and why, the question is if you want to learn the common and strongmodernstrong ways of building webui application with Java, where is best to start to pick the essentials of building scalable and reliable web applications that can grow from a startup site with a few pages to huge applications with hundreds of connections per secondp
Negative 26050 pI have metadata in a DB table that i want to use in code.

The problem with this is if someone changes the description of the TimeType from NormalTime to something eles the hardcoded string const sais one thing and the db data sais something else. And yes, this has happend as i dont have control over the DB content p  pSo, how do I solve this in the best maintainable and readable way where changes can occur in the DB table and the code dont get very hard to read. Where someone can add TimeTypes to the DB and later I can add methods that uses them in code.p
Negative 26050 pTo provide some runtime generated API documentation I want to iterate over all Spring MVC controllers. All controllers are annotated with the Spring Controller annotation. Currently I do it like thisp  precodefor final Object bean this.context.getBeansWithAnnotation         Controller.class.values      ...Generate controller documentation for the bean...  codepre  pBut the first call of this code is strongEXTREMELYstrong slow. I wonder if Spring iterates over strongALLstrong classes in the classpath instead of just checking the defined beans. The controllers are already loaded when the above code is run, the log displays all of them with their request mappings so Spring MVC must already know them all and there must be a faster way to get a list of them.

Negative 26050 pWhat Im going to describe can be the expected behaviour for people who know the JSF phase cycle well, but it is not obvious for me, so I ask for confirmation. In a JSF page I put a listener for a prerenderview event. The page is processed in consequence of a jsfforward. The listener is not executed. If I access the page directly through its url perfroming a GET the listener is executed. Is there something wrong with my code or is this the right behaviour  I searched a lot on internet but didnt find anything useful. p  pUpdate As I stated in the comments I jumped to wrong conclusion. What I described is not a general behaviour but a special case due to bugs or a more complex scenario. p  pUpdate 2 After further investigation I came to this conclusion the problem seems to be related to a wrong way to put the preRenderView listener in a page which uses templates.

Negative 26050 pSo Ive worked on getting a jquery carousel to work with the design of my site.  The carousel is found here a hrefhttpwww.fortelessons.com relnofollowhttpwww.fortelessons.coma. I minimized all the javascript on the site, so to view the specific jquery before minimizing for the carousel I made a copy of it here a hrefhttpfortelessons.comjsfullinfinite.js relnofollowhttpfortelessons.comjsfullinfinite.jsap  pSo it works everywhere I have tested it just fine.  But now I look at Chrome 20.0.1132.57 and Im having some very weird issues.  On the first initial load it looks great.  But then if I reload the page Learn Piano, Learn Voice, and Learn Guitar are moved over to the left by one instrument leaving a blank below the picture of the guitar.  If I clear the cache and reload its fine, but once it is in the cache it does it again.  How does this make any sense  I dont even know where to begin.  It doesnt do this with my current version of firefox or IE, just Chrome.p  pI can post a more detailed description of what the jquery is doing if it would save you time looking through the code, but I just wanted to know if it was reproducible by anyone or if anyone had any idea why the page being cached would somehow change how it was displayed.  I dont even know how to start debugging it.p  pEDIT Actually its only when I click the reload button.  If I click around the site and then click back theres no problem.  But once I click reload it gets messed up.  If I then click around again it goes back to normal.  I guess in reality this wouldnt be a huge issue because it would almost never happen, but still I would like to know whats going on.p

Negative 26050 pAs can be seen in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12159595howtogetapointertoanspecificsectionofaprogramfromwithinitselfmasecond answer for this questiona , its quite simple to get a pointer to an specific section of a program from within itself, using the sections name. With codelibelfcode, just open the programs own file, loop over all sections which are represented by codeElf64Shdrcode structs in it, stop when the section name matches the one you want and use the pointer stored in the codeshaddrcode element of the codeElf64Shdrcode struct. In this case, its very simple to get the wanted pointer because it is defined in the ELF executable file.p  pBut, imagine you have a program that uses a dynamic library and you need to get a pointer to a section of that dynamic library. Since the addresses of its sections are defined in runtime, how is it possible to get pointers to sections of a dynamic libraryp  pBy the way, both the dynamic library and the main program itself have, each one, a section with the same name which is the one I need to get a pointer to. So, in this case, is it possible that these two sections with the same name are stored adjacently in memory, so that I just need to get a pointer to the main files section as I explained in the first paragraph and add an offset to reach the dynamic library sectionp

Negative 26050 pIm using java, and have a largeish 15000 set of keywords strings, and I have a document string that contains these keywords periodically.p  pId like to find the indices of each use of the keywords in the document, with a preference to longer keywords ones with the most characters.  For example, if my keywords were water, bottle, drank, and water bottle, and my document were I drank from my water bottle, Id like a result ofp  p2 drankp  p16 water bottlep  pMy initial attempts were to use a trie, and go through the document characterbycharacter, and whenever a substring matches a keyword, record the initial index.  However some of the keywords are prefixes for longer keywords for example, water and water bottle, and the code would never find the longer one, as it would record waters index, and then start over.p  pIf it matters, the keywords may contain lower case letters, upper case letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes and capitalization matters.p  pSo, any help in finding the longest keywords would be much appreciated.

Negative 26050 pIn the past, my projects has grown to be hard to manage, especially when I have to revisit after a few years to redo or make significant update to one part without having to redo everything. This time Im focusing hard on making it easy and possible to make a pluggable application design to allow me to revisit and redo one part without touching everything.p  pIm thinking of this structurep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRrYJo.png altApplications structurep  pSo what I want is to be able to work on Bounded Context 2 and expand that with a lot of new functionality the coming monthyears while Bounded Context 1 is left as is. I will also work on the UI, especially the parts concerning Bounded Context 2. I would also like to give users the ability to work with bounded context 2 from other devices.p  pPreferably even the web technologies used in the UI of bounded context 2 will be updated since this is our primary area of focus and is used the most, so it might even be smart to put that in its own UI project for web and have a landing site that gives common functionality like managing users and let users log in.p  pRight now Im thinking of seperating all of this into seperate Solutions in Visual Studio to ease management. But I could make a folder for each in one solution and put everything there.p  pMy question is what is the recommended way of doing this, and what should I consider before seperating into different strongsolutionsstrongp  pemAre there any best practices of how to manage this Anyone with experience of what works and notemp  pBtw since this is divided by bounded contexts there will need to be communication between parts of the system, although no direct dependency i.e. context 1 manages and maintains business logic for registering employees that again are needed in context 2.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I realize some more information is needed.p  pThere are more bounded contexts than these two. None of them are really like a department, i.e. Employee Managment is the context managers are in when they need to organizearchive information related to managing others, and also get reminders on important events. Purchasing is the context employees are in when they purchase goods for a department and do inventory, there might be 2040 organizational departments that use this. Im considering if reporting is a seperate bounded context though without very much interesting logic and behavior. These tend to start small providing basic functionality, then grow with time as more functionality is added and people discover new needs. They are updated separately, and I hope some of them will grow into larger systems in time even though they start solving rather basic needs. p

Negative 26050 pI am using CDT for C development which uses gdb for debugging purposes. The debug variables view only shows the declared type of the variables  not the actual type based on vtable information. Since I am heavily relying on dynamic subclassing, the declared type often does not contain the information I need. I must also inpsect the values of the actual subclass. I have found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2529561vtableinpolymorphicclassofcusinggdbvtable in polymorphic class of C using gdba and it is said that gdb is able to print the actual type based on vtable information using the following commandp  precodeset print object on codepre  pBut how to do this in Eclipse CDT p  pBtw Isnt this a quite common use case so that it should be enabled by default As soon as someone uses inheritance and virtual stuff, it is extremely important to see the real object type during debugging. Showing only the declared type feels for me like coming from the stone age.p

Negative 26050 pIm trying to set up a serial communication between the RPI and an FPGA. However, there is an issue when using the standard C library open to init the serial interface Im using a scope to monitor what is sent and received via the RX and TX lines. A call to open causes the TX line of the RPI to go low for the length of one bit. I do not see this behavior with other computerslinux PCs. The point is, the FPGA assumes a valid transmission, since he thinks its a start bit, but its not. p  pI checked with minicom installed on the RPI. Same thing. Starting minicom causes the TX line sending one bit. Once minicom has started, the communication runs as expected and all bytes have the correct frame size. Is there any way to suppress the TX line going low upon the open call to init the serial communication Is this an expected behavior p

This is different to a token which would need to be passed for every request, where as in this example they have a session.p  pNow the questions...p  ol lipIs it bad practice for the user to be actually logged into the API with a session like shown above It seems like the most secure way to handle authentication for a device as its using the same logic as the direct web root.pli lipIve seen some APIs use access tokens instead which Ive also implemented user gets their token returned instead of the boolean and no session is created. But from what I can tell, this seems like more work as then I need to check for the access token against a user record every time a request is made.pli ol

Negative 26050 pI am writing an ASP.NET web page which calls an API to update my clients property website using XML data. The data from the API is realtime, so I would like to run the page every 10 minutes.p  pClearly I dont want to load my page manually to keep my clients property website uptodate. There is a lot of help in Stack Overflow and elsewhere on this type of question but I have become a little overwhelmed by the options. I think that one way to go would bep  ol liWindows Task Scheduler to fire every ten minutes to trigger a VB.Net Serviceli liVB.Net Service to run the web pageli liMy page runs..li ol  pThat feels like overkill, and I havent written a Windows Service or used the Task Scheduler and it feels like there should be 2 steps not three.p  pNow if I do use a VB.Net Service then I think that it might be better to give more work to the VB.Net Service rather than put my script in a web page, but I am used to writing web pagesp  pI cant help feeling that if I just keep the page open in a browser somewhere I can easily use JavaScript to run the page every 10 minutes, but that means ensuring its open in a browser. Bad solution I think...p  pWhat I need is an overview of my options to make an informed decision and if it means learning then fine. Thanks in advancep

Negative 26050 pI have planned to create an SDK in android, that means to share my class files and resourcelayouts to another application that requires them. If I export my application as JAR it does not include the resource files and R.class. I know currently Android does not support to packaging resource file via JAR but I searched the net and found one solution if compile our resource files with source code means we can access the resource in some other application.p  pSo for that reason I did it in the following wayp  ol lipcopied all res folders content  into  my source folderp  ul lisrc     com.mypackege        reshere i put my res folderli lipfinally my src folder look likepli lipsrc p  blockquote   pcom.mypackagep blockquote  precode      gtmyfile.java      drawablehdpi      drawableldpi      drawablemdpi      drawablexhdpi      com.mypackage.drawable      com.mypackage.layout      com.mypackage.menu      com.mypackage.values codepreli ulli lipand i build my project i got all class files including resource and r.class in my binpli lipthen i create jar manually by jar cvf mysample.jar commypackagepli lipthe final jar contain all classes and resource of my project in side mypackage.pli ol  pthen I add codemysample.jarcode into another application say codetestappcode, here I put the JAR in asset folderbecause of layout and add to build path. And also I configure the build pathp  pIn this application I call the codemyfile.classcode from codemysample.jarcode which is needed to load the layout from that JAR.p  pThe problem is here it doesnt see resource under the JAR file it only see the resource in current project res folder and though codeNULL pointer Exceptioncodep  pBut it calls the R.java from JAR file.

Negative 26050 pMy ear application was working fine. But suddenly it started to throw javax.ejb.EJBException in some method calls, instead of returning the original Application Exception annotated with ApplicationExceptionrollbacktrue. Now the original application exception is wrapped in the EJBException. the Currently the other developer who was working in the project is on leave. Therefore I have no idea what he has done to the code for happening this. This application exception and ejb remote interfaces are in a separate jar file which is deployed as a shared library in the weblogic. p  pI would like to know what can be responsible for throwing this EJBException instead of throwing the application exception. I think may be ApplicationException annotation is not correctly detected by the weblogic. Could anyone give me a help to resolve this issue p

Negative 26050 pI have a datagridview and am trying to dynamically update the background color of a row depending on the result of a comparison between one column and two others.

The values in the present column for each row update dynamically. p  pI use a class called MinMaxTester that implements the IValueConverter interface to compare contents of cells to return a brush color. p  pWith the solution I have implemented, I note that the background color sometimes updates.

Negative 26050 pI am developing an application with CakePHP 2.3.2 and I am having some trouble with an input select on a form. I am creating an array, in my Controller, which contains a list of states. In my View I find that when I use this variable in the options field of the input I do not get any select options.

Negative 26050 pSup guys was just reading some things about Linked Lists and I stumbled along this questionbr Is the following a valid or invalid statement Explain your answer. We can assume we are using genericsp  precodeLinkedList ltintgt theList  new LinkedUnorderedList ltintgt  codepre  p I think its a valid statement because autoboxing occurs when we declare an int which is then put into a list. Meaning that the int itself becomes an object of type int. p  pJust want to check with some of you here if this is correct.Or is my understanding of this completely off. p

Negative 26050 pIm trying to basically make a simple Test Generator. I want a button to parse a text file and add the records to my database. The questions and answers are in a text file. I have been searching the net for examples but I cant find one that matches my situation. p  pThe text file has header information that I want to ignore up until the line that starts with  End of Syllabus. I want  End of Syllabus to indicate the beginning of the questions. A couple of lines after that look for a line with a  in the seventh character position. I want that to indicate the Question Number line. The Question Number line is unique in that the  is in the seventh character position.  I want to use that as an indicator to mark the start of a new question. In the Question Number line, the first three characters together T1A are the Question Group. The last part of the T1Aem01em is the question number within that group.p  pSo, as you can see I will also need to get the actual question text line and the answer lines as well. Also typically after the four Answer lines is the Question Terminator indicated by . I dont know how I would be able to do this for all the questions in the text file. Do I keep adding them to an array String How would I access this information from the file and add it to a database.

Negative 26050 pI dont want to allow a codeulcodes codelicodes to be sortable if there is one or more elements with the class codeunsavedcode inside it. How to achieve thisp  pstrongPsuedo codestrongp  precodevar mylist  mylist  mylist.sortable     start function          if.unsaved, mylist.length               DONOT ALLOW SORTING          else               OK GO AHEAD AND SORT ALL YOU WANT                 mylist.disableSelection codepre  h2Edith2  pSorry I should have been more clear. I cant just do a check to see if elements with the class codeunsavedcode exists before apply the sortable method on the list because at any given time an element can be added or removed to the list with the class unsaved.p  pIn fact when the page loads there will never be an element with class unsaved on the list. But during the course of time an element with that class can be added and if so I dont want the user to be able to sort and as soon as it is removed I want to reenable sorting.p  pHope that clarifies my issue.p

Negative 26050 pI have a program written in IDLE3.3 and tkinter where I dont know where to place the mainloop. The program creates a systray icon that creates a little note if you click on new note in the context menu. If there is the line self.root.mainloop at the end of Note.stronginitstrong, the note is shown, but only one note. if I create a second one, the first note is dead and nothing further happens. But if I dont call the mainloop in the initmethod, i see that there a several notes created because it is printed in the shell.  So the question is, where should I place the mainloop so that every newly created notw is shown and works Sorry for that possibly stupid question but I cant figure it out.p  precodefrom tkinter import  import sys from PyQt4.QtGui import  import threading   class Note      yellow[e7e37c,d9d574]      def initself,notesetNone, propertiesNone         self.rootTk         self.notesetnoteset         self.propertiesproperties         self.screenwidth  self.root.winfoscreenwidth               self.screenheight  self.root.winfoscreenheight             printNo initial properties to load gt creating new note         self.notecolorself.yellow[0]         self.gripcolorself.yellow[1]         self.root.overrideredirect1          self.text         self.fontarial         self.fontsize10           self.sizeX250          self.sizeY200         self.posXintself.screenwidth2  self.sizeX2            self.posYintself.screenheight2  self.sizeY2         self.root.wmgeometrysxsss   self.sizeX,  self.sizeY,  self.posX,  self.posY                     self.root.wmattributestopmost,1         self.GUI         self.bindings          self.root.mainloop      def bindingsself         self.frmGRIP.bindltButtonPress1gt, self.StartMove         self.frmGRIP.bindltButtonRelease1gt, self.StopMove         self.frmGRIP.bindltB1Motiongt, self.OnMotion      def StartMoveself, event         self.startx  event.x         self.starty  event.y     def OnMotionself, event                    mousex,mouseyself.root.winfopointerxy         self.root.geometryss  mousexself.startx, mouseyself.starty     def StopMoveself, event         self.posX  self.root.winfox         self.posY  self.root.winfoy      def GUIself                          self.frmTOPFramemasterself.root,height15         self.frmBOTTOMFramemasterself.root,width300,height300         self.frmGRIPFrameself.frmTOP,bgself.gripcolor,height15         self.frmRESIZEFrameself.frmBOTTOM,width300,height10         self.frmTEXTFrameself.frmBOTTOM,bgself.notecolor,width300,height300         self.frmRESIZEemptyFrameself.frmRESIZE,bgself.notecolor,height10         self.frmRESIZEgripFrameself.frmRESIZE,bgself.gripcolor,width10,height10          self.frmTOP.packfillX,expandNO         self.frmBOTTOM.packsideBOTTOM,fillBOTH,expandYES          self.frmGRIP.packsideLEFT,fillX,expandYES         self.frmRESIZE.packsideBOTTOM,fillX                 self.frmTEXT.packsideBOTTOM,fillBOTH,expandYES         self.frmRESIZEempty.packsideLEFT,fillX,expandYES         self.frmRESIZEgrip.packsideLEFT,expandNO          self.TTextself.frmTEXT,                     height6,width30,                     bd0,wrapWORD,pady3,padx5,                     bgself.notecolor,undo1,                     fontself.font,self.fontsize                              self.T.insertEND,self.text         self.T.packfillBOTH,expandYES          class Noteset     def initself         self.notes  []     def newNoteself         noteNotenotesetself         self.notes.appendnote         printself.notes         return note  class Main     def initself         self.NNoteset         app  QApplicationsys.argv          trayIcon  QSystemTrayIconQIconJpythonSimpleNotes.ico, app         menu  QMenu          ActionNewNote  menu.addActionnew Note         ActionNewNote.triggered.connectself.newNote         trayIcon.setContextMenumenu         trayIcon.show          app.exec      def newNoteself         self.N.newNote   Main codepre

Joey Gallo began his criminal career as a smalltime loan shark and jukebox racketeer. He became a top enforcer in the Profaci crime family, but felt he never got the respect he deserved. So Gallo formed his own gang and revolted against mafia Don Joe Profaci in a long, bloody war on the streets of New York. But there was another side to Joey Gallothe ruthless mob leader was also an artist and an avid reader. Living in Greenwich Village with his wife Jeffie, Gallo was inspired by his beatnik neighbors and their counterculture ideas. He also began hobnobbing with New Yorks social elite, befriending everyone from Neil Simon to Jerry Orbach. In the end though, nothing could save Joey Gallo from a dramatic end.ltpgt ltpgtTV14 ltpgt ltpgt ltpgt Charles Darwin, lta hrefpeoplecharlesdarwin9266433gthttpwww.biography.compeoplecharlesdarwin9266433ltagt last visited Aug 27, 2013.ltpgt ltpgt Charles Darwin.

Negative 26050 pIm trying to figure out how to resize UITextView and everything actually without losing constraints. Basically, Im trying to layout a page where most components can have variable sizes like description. I tried doing it with a simple use case where I have a UITextView and a UIButton underneath. I want to make sure that the position of the button is relative to the bottom of the UITextView.p  precode voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated      [super viewDidAppearanimated]     CGRect frame  self.textView.frame     int height  self.textView.contentSize.height     frame.size.height  height     self.textView.frame  frame  codepre  pWhat I ended up with is UITextView overlapping with UIButton. After doing a bit of research, it seems that if I replace the frame, all constraints are gone also. I tried copying the constraints over, but of course the pointer is still pointing at the old frame so that didnt help at all.p  pIs there a good way to solve a very dynamically laid out page Im trying to at least use interface builder rather than code everything.p  h2EDITEDh2  pI tried updating the constraint as suggested, but that didnt actually resize the UITextView.

Still no luck however.p  precodeint height  self.textView.contentSize.height self.textViewHeightConstraint.constant  height codepre  h2EDITED 2h2  pI figured it out now.

Negative 26050 pIve been facing an intermittent issue with automapper across a couple of different projects.p  p99.9 of the time, mapping on nullable bools works properly.  However, intermittently, at some point it starts incorrectly mapping false and null values for sure, and on even rarer occasion I have seen it map false to true.p  pFor a long time I thought it might be in my head, but today it was verified while demonstrating a new piece of functionality to my coworker.  Consistently, it was mapping null to false, and false to null.  Once it starts, it will happen with every nullable bool, as far as I can tell.  p  pThe odd thing is that it will stop doing this as soon as I rebuild the project.p  pOn one project, we believe that the problem was solved by writing a small function that just took in the source values and gave the obvious values back, but that was on mapping from a nullable bool to a nonnullable bool.  But today, it happened from a nullable bool to a nullable bool.p  pAnd I have not one idea how to debug this.  I cant get it to reproduce with any degree of predictability, and have gone so far as to write a selenium test that ran 3000 times to attempt to trip it off, to no avail.p  pI have a trace.axd from the request from earlier today, if that might help out.p  pCan anyone give me suggestions  We use C, Visual Studio, IIS, AutoMapper, and .Net MVC and Entity Framework.p  pAt this point, Im so flustered that I dont know what other information I can give.  Im on the high end of junior developer myself, but it was verified by a senior developer on my team today.  Feels nice to know Im not seeing things.p

Negative 26050 pI have a vagrant box set up with rails 4, the latest version of mongodb and mongoid. Once the vagrant box is up I can hit mongodb using codemongocode and I can access mongodb and any existing databases. The problem seems to be that my rails code isnt writing into the mongodb. Has anyone else experienced this Is there a configuration issue that Im not seeing What tests should I run so that I can get some errors to help debug this issue p  pThanksp  pEdit Okay so upon restarting the webserver it seems to work now. Or at least I can try to query mongodb via rails console. Ill update as I continue to test more. p  pEdit 2 And so in the rails sandboxed console I can try to look into a User collection using User.all but User.first gives me an error as follows. p  precodeMongoidErrorsNoSessionConfig Problem   No configuration could be found for a session named default. Summary   When attempting to create the new session, Mongoid could not find a session configuration for the name default. This is necessary in order to know the host, port, and options needed to connect. Resolution   Double check your mongoid.yml to make sure under the sessions key that a configuration exists for default. If you have set the configuration programatically, ensure that default exists in the configuration hash. codepre  pFollowing the Resolution suggestions, I did a quick check of mongoid.yml under codeconfigmongoid.ymlcode and I see it listed as suchp  precodedevelopment   sessions     default       database mongoid       hosts          localhost21017       options   options test   sessions     default       database mongoid       hosts          localhost21017       options         consistency strong         maxretries 1         retryinterval 0 codepre  pEdit 3 It looks like this issue only occurs when Im trying to run the rails console in sandbox mode. It works fine in the normal rails console. Anyway to make it work in the sandbox consolep  pEdit 4 spellingp  pAny insights will be very helpful. Thanksp

Negative 26050 pIn a project we are working on we have a bunch of boilerplate code that gets copied to a number of projects.  We are using GIT for version control.  p  pCurrently I am using a .bat file to copy boilerplate files, set the readonly attribute on each file and apply a comment header to .js, .html and .css files waring the user that this file was generated automatically and not bother editing it.p  pThis is working ok but not foolproof.  If the boilerplate code is refactored and items deleted client projects will still have the old file hanging around.  Git does not remember windows attributes such as readonly.p  pIs there a better way of doing this to overcome these restrictionsp

Negative 26050 h3The problemh3  pWe have to find a solution that both the backend and frontend can use for templating.  The goal is to make the frontend build maintainable, and have only in one format. p  pThe frontend right now uses mustachehandlebars, andor swig. Unfortunately, the mustache library for .Net we found was not sufficient, and as far as I know there is no swig support for .Net. p  pIn the current workflow the backend digests the pure HTML output of the frontend. This build is based on javascript implementations of a mustachehbs or swig parser. Which can be both used in nodejs or on the client side. Convenient.  But the problem is, after the server takes apart this build, someone has to keep track of changes line by line. And the server side cant use the partials the frontend created. They use asp.net mvc...p  pIf both the backend and frontend could use the same template language for buildserve the views, that would eliminate the need to maintain two separate formats of the same code. p  pThe question is, is there a known template language that both .Net and javascript can understand  Or if not, what could you suggest to make this workflow, and the code base more maintainablep  pNote we dont have the resources to write a custom template for this.p

Negative 26050 pCurrently, I am learning generic or meta programming in Shapeless. I am facinated about the feature which can check the logic during compilation instead of runtime. There are 2 amazing examples 1. Checksum a hrefhttpsgist.github.comtravisbrown3763016 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comtravisbrown3763016a 2. TowersOfHanoi a hrefhttpsgist.github.comjrudolph66925 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comjrudolph66925ap  pHowever, I think those 2 examples thrust me so quickly into the deeper areas of this feature. Only I know so far is some tricks as followp  p1 define the context bound to use implicit to make sure class has correct constraint. I think that is reason we have to lift some primitive types into class type like int, so compiler know what type is I am not sure about my argument. Code p  precodeobject bla    implicitly[A ltlt B]  codepre  p2 using macros. p  pAre there other magic tricks to fulfill that p  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 26050 pI am plotting up to 16 traces, each one with 300 datapoints, I am updating continuously 100 datapoints every 100 ms.

Is there any way to improve even more the plotting speed or that amount of points is really reaching the limit of what can be achieved with JChart2D.p  pAs a note, JChart2D is way better than other libraries as JFreeChart for real time applications.

Negative 26050 pWhat is the correct a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAbstractsyntaxtree relnofollowabstract syntax treea for representing algebra I have tried way too many setups, and constantly been rewriting the syntax tree, and all of my configurations end up forgetting something important e.g. fractions not being supported. Currently my configurations for equations and expressions seem to be fine. Expressions simply consist of an array of terms, each with a positivenegative sign, and a coefficient. Thats where the trouble comes in. What emexactlyem is a term Wikipedia helps some, and even has an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTermmathematicsFormaldefinition relnofollowexample ASTa for a couple of terms. However, for practical purposes Im trying to keep everything closer to the concepts we use when we learn algebra, rather than breaking it down into nothing but variables and operators. It appears that just about anything can be contained in a term terms can contain fractions which contain expressions, subterms, subexpressions, and regular variables, each of them having their own exponents.br Currently my configuration is something like thisp  precode                                      Term                                                                                                                                    Coefficient   ArrayList of     ArrayList of      ArrayList of   ArrayList of                   subexpressions  powers of         fractions      powers of                                      subexpressions  may contain   fractions                                        variables                    integerdecimal  fraction                  no variables codepre  pExpressionsfractions dont have exponents on their own, but may have one outside sometimes e.g. code2x33code.  p  pNOTE For the sake of simplicity the diagram leaves out an ArrayList of variables and one for roots, an an ArrayList of their respective exponents, all contained by the term.  p  pNOTE 2 In case its not clear, the diagram doesnt show inheritance. Its showing members of the Term class.p  pThis seems rather sloppy to me, and might not scale well with the project when things get more complex. emIs a term really supposed to be this kind of soupem I have a feeling yet another thing should be included in term, but I cant think of what it would be. Although Ive been strugling with this for some months, I havent taken the discipline to just stop and emreallyem work it out, which I should have done before starting. p  pAm I making a mistake in making nearly everything fit in a term If so, what should I be doing instead If not, is it really supposed to be this... uglynonintuitive Part of my feeling that this must be wrong is due to the fact that that almost no one thinks of an algebraic term this way. p  pExample term code2.3x23423x6x6code overly complex, I know, but it contains everything mentioned above.p  pMy real question What is the correct syntax structure for the the term, the heart and soul of algebrap

Negative 26050 pI have an ASP.NET application written in .NET 4.0. When I run the application through Visual Studio, everything works and looks good. Same thing when I deploy it to IIS7 on my local machine. However, when I deploy it to stronganother boxstrong running on Windows Server 2008 R2 with .NET 4.0 and IIS7, I get the following parse errorp  precode Cannot create an object of type System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBoxMode from its   string representation Number for the TextMode property. codepre  pIts complaining that the codeTextModecode property on codeaspTextBoxcode doesnt contain the codeNumbercode option, even though it works perfectly fine on my local IIS. I a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19185524textboxmodedatetimelocalnotworkingwhendeployedtoiiscame across this posta and people are suggesting the two machines have different .NET versions. This is not the case for me both machines are have .NET 4.0 and IIS7. p  pBesides this error, other pages are also rendered differently stylewise. For example, IIS on the server machine doesnt respect the codeWidthcode property on any of the codeaspTextBoxcode controls I have to apply the width as a style, even though my local IIS renders them just fine. Im using IE10 wo compatibility mode. p  pI originally thought the problem might have been with missing codejscode or codestylecode files, but IE reports success status for all content files  in the codeNetwork Profilercode window.p  pIm truly lost at this point. The code, IIS settings, and .NET versions are exactly identical on these two boxes, but the pages are rendered differently. The only thing I can think of is that some other Web component was installed with Visual Studio that is changing the way IIS renders aspx pages. Is that possible If anyone has come across this issue at some point Id appreciate it if you could give me some pointers as to what could be causing the issue.p

Negative 26050 pWe are trying to validate the ID Token IDT presented to a .NET client application by an OpenID Connect Provider OP. The IDT is what you would expect. Nothing unusual going on there.p  pTo verify the signature of the IDT, we can get the exponent and modulus from the OP by calling a public endpoint. These can be used to create a public key that corresponds to the private one used by the OP to sign the IDT. With these, we create a RSACryptoServiceProvider object to do the signature verification.To help with this, we are are passing the crypto service provider as a token validation parameter to a JwtSecurityTokenHandler. p  pThis works fine. We thought we were done and ready for the weekend. However, we found that strongwe can change the last character in the signature and the JwtSecurityTokenHandler will still tell us the JWT is validstrong. We cannot find an explanation for this and are wondering ifp  ol liIt is a problem with the way we are creating the signing key which is causing it to improperly validate JWTs.li liThere is a bug in the JwtSecurityTokenHandler.li liWe are not understanding the spec completely and this small alteration is allowed because the last character in the signature part of the JWT is actually not pertinent for verification.li liSomething elseli ol  pWe are using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.JwtSecurityTokenHandler from System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt.dll v4.0.30319.p  pA very simple sample of our code is

Each additional line after that has a pair of two double values no commasp  pFor Example p     4 p     13 15p     20.2 33.5p     24 38p     30 31pp  petc.p  pI have two static double arrays, x and y. For each line after the first, I want to assign the first double in the set to x, and the second double in the set to y. However, im not 100 sure what to do how to assign. This is my code so far note that line is a call to another method not shownp  precodeScanner input  new ScannerSystem.in     System.out.printlnEnter the name of the data file.     fileName  input.nextLine      whileinput.hasNext              int num  input.nextInt  the first line integer         line.x[0]  input.nextDouble the additional line x coordinate         line.y[0]  input.nextDouble the additional line y coordinate      codepre  pThe only problem is, how do I increment the value of x and y from [0] to [1], [2], 3, etc for each additional line in the file, based on what the first line int value num is, so that I dont keep overwriting [0] p For example, in the example above, the value of num is 4, because there are four additional lines after it. How do I increase  the value of x and y by one based on the value of num I know this sounds stupid but Im stumped at this point.p

Negative 26050 pI would like to present a camera preview in my app, that takes a photo when you click a button.

The reason Im posting here is because Im not getting any error from the console so had no other choice. thanksp  pcodep  precode  ltscriptgt      var intervalId  0    var xball 200   var yball 200   var dxball 2   var dyball 4     var WIDTH 400     var HEIGHT 400         var bricks   var rowh  brickh  padding   var row  Math.flooryballrowh     var nrows  5   var col  Math.floorxballcolw   var colw  brickw  padding     var ncols  5        var brickw  400ncols 1     var brickh  15     var padding  1     this function initializes the draw function every 10 ms    function init        ctxc.getContext2d     intervalId  setIntervaldraw, 10       .....     function initbricks          bricks  new Arraynrows     for i0 ilt nrows i           bricks[i]  new Array ncols       for j0 jlt ncols j               bricks[i][j]  1                   function draw           drawing bricks       for i0 i lt nrows i                for j0 j lt ncols j                   if bricks[i][j]  1                       ctx.beginPath            ctx.rectj  brickw  padding  padding,                      i  brickh  padding  padding,                     brickw, brickh            ctx.fill                                  .....     here the collision detection is suppose to happen    if yball lt nrows  rowh ampamp row gt 0 ampamp col gt 0 ampamp bricks[row][col]  1       dyball  dyball      bricks[row][col]  0          clearIntervalintervalId             init    initpaddle    initbricks    ltscriptgt    ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pthe compelete running codep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt   ltheadgt   ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltbodygt    lt The actual canvasgt      ltcanvas idmyCanvas          width400         height400          styleborder1px solid c3c3c3gt       ltcanvasgt   lt The end of canvasgt    ltscriptgt    var c  document.getElementByIdmyCanvas   var ctx  c.getContext2d     var intervalId  0    var xball 200   var yball 200   var dxball 2   var dyball 4     var WIDTH 400     var HEIGHT 400         var paddlex     var paddleh     var paddlew     var rightDown  false   var leftDown  false      var bricks   var rowh  brickh  padding   var row  Math.flooryballrowh     var nrows  5        var col  Math.floorxballcolw   var colw  brickw  padding     var ncols  5      var brickw  400ncols 1     var brickh  15     var padding  1     the function for keyboard controls    function onKeyDownevt         ifevt.keyCode39 rightDown  true      else ifevt.keyCode 37 leftDown  true        function onKeyUpevt           if evt.keyCode  39 rightDown  false       else if evt.keyCode  37 leftDown  false           document.keydownonKeyDown      document. keyuponKeyUp     .....     this function initializes the paddle   function initpaddle       paddlex  400  2    paddleh 15    paddlew 200       .....     this function initializes the draw function every 10 ms    function init        ctxc.getContext2d     intervalId  setIntervaldraw, 10       .....    function initbricks         bricks  new Arraynrows     for i0 ilt nrows i           bricks[i]  new Array ncols       for j0 jlt ncols j               bricks[i][j]  1                   function draw            clear an area in the rectangle, draw the ball     ctx.clearRect0,0,400,400     ctx.beginPath     ctx.arcxball, yball, 10, 0, Math.PI2, true      ctx.closePath     ctx.fill      .....       draw the paddle       ctx.beginPath      ctx.rectpaddlex, HEIGHTpaddleh, paddlew, paddleh      ctx.fill      .....     move the paddle if left or right is currently pressed      if rightDown paddlex  5       else if leftDown paddlex  5     ......     drawing bricks       for i0 i lt nrows i                for j0 j lt ncols j                   if bricks[i][j]  1                       ctx.beginPath            ctx.rectj  brickw  padding  padding,                      i  brickh  padding  padding,                     brickw, brickh            ctx.fill                                  .....     here the collision detection is suppose to happen    if yball lt nrows  rowh ampamp row gt 0 ampamp col gt 0 ampamp bricks[row][col]  1       dyball  dyball      bricks[row][col]  0       ...    if xball  dxball  10 gt WIDTH  xball  dxball  10 lt 0      dxball  dxball    if yball  dyball  10 lt 0      dyball  dyball    else if yball  dyball  10 gt HEIGHT  paddleh       if xball gt paddlex ampamp xball lt paddlex  paddlew         move the ball differently based on where it hit the paddle        dxball  8  xballpaddlexpaddlew2paddlew        dyball  dyball          else if yball  dyball  10 gt HEIGHT        clearIntervalintervalId            increment x and y by the value of dx and dy      xball  dxball      yball  dyball       .....     ..........          init    initpaddle    initbricks    ltscriptgt    ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 26050 pI am pretty new to writing clientserver based apps. both server and client classes are kicked off in threads. New to using Object Outputinput streams over tcp aswell. Have never had fun with serialization. In my application I am trying to use Object InputOutput Streaming but it looks like opening them is causing my application dies. The funny thing is that if I comment two linesp  precodeoutStream  new ObjectOutputStreamsocket.getOutputStream inStream  new ObjectInputStreamsocket.getInputStream codepre  pConnection works nicely and app proceeds to the next panels etc. But I am still not capable of sending any objects throughout the socket. When I literally try to open those streams. It still connects but app get freezed.

Negative 26050 pThere are 2 Oracle databases with the same tables on two different servers. Database A on server A and Database B on server Bp  pA Table1,Table2p  pB Table1,Table2p  pThese tables are identical to each other, in that its possible to copy the data tables from server A to server B. We only have remote access to the database on Server A, but full admin access to Server B.p  pSo, database A is remote and has a primary and secondary DB. The secondary DB gets updated with the latest data, then we must switch the DB were pointing to towards secondary. Same for the opposite, when things are pointing to secondary, primary DB will get updated with data, then the system should point to Database A primary. This way the database is never down we just switch what we point to after the other one gets updated.p  pThere is also a web interface that sets a config file whether were pointing to the primary or the secondary DBp  pNow, Im trying to come up with solutions on how to getsynchronizecopypoint to the correct database to get the updated data either directly from A or by copying data A to B.p  pSolution 1 We read db config file and point directly to the primary or secondary DBp  pSolution 2 Build a windows service that will detect when primary or secondary DB gets updated, and copy tables from DataBase A to DataBase B.p  pSolution 3 Have a copy tables button on the web interface that will start a background task of copying data from A to B using a hrefhttphangfire.io relnofollowhttphangfire.ioap  pSolution 4 p  pSo far, I like the idea of solution 1 the best, where we just point directly to either the primary or secondary DB based on configuration. This idea doesnt involve any copying to the identical tables on Server B. p  pHowever, I was wondering if there is any other possible solution Would triggers, replication, or something else work herep  pThanks.p

Whenever a post is made, I send a notification to others.p  pThat notification is sent via codeGCM.sendnotificationdestinations, datacode of the pushmeup gem. p  pThe data I get back from GCM.sendnotification isp  p[responsesuccess, bodymulticastid1234, success2, failure0, canonicalids1, results[registrationid1234, messageid01234, messageid01234], headerscontenttype[applicationjson charsetUTF8], date[Wed, 21 Jan 2015 020932 GMT], expires[Wed, 21 Jan 2015 020932 GMT], cachecontrol[private, maxage0], xcontenttypeoptions[nosniff], xframeoptions[SAMEORIGIN], xxssprotection[1 modeblock], server[GSE], alternateprotocol[443quic,p0.02], acceptranges[none], vary[AcceptEncoding], connection[close], statuscode200]p  pI edited out any large ids and replaced them with 1234.p  pWell, since the response is success, I assume this means the notification was sent... but when I check my android phone it wasnt.p  pNote that a few days ago notifications were working, so I dont know what got messed upp  pOn the android side, my AndroidManifest.xml includesp  precodeltreceiver             androidnamecom.my.app.GcmBroadcastReceiver             androidpermissioncom.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND gt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnamecom.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE gt                  ltcategory androidnamecom.my.app gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltreceivergt          ltservice androidnamecom.my.app.GcmIntentService gt codepre  pThe part in particular I find very puzzling is when I go to Google Cloud Messaging, and try to track requests that get there, it says there has been absolutely no traffic, so I think there is a problem with receiving the messages on the Google Cloud Messaging side, but I have no idea why or what would cause it.p  pI actually narrowed it down to having to be the Android phone.

Negative 26050 pI have a grid in bootstrap that works perfectly on Chrome and Firefox, but in IE the columns take on the width of the parent element and stack on on top of the other, I have tried multiple changes to the code and nothing works Its almost as if IE completely ignores the col classes, Ive added meta tags, changed layout styles, etc,p  pCan you please tell me how to help IE

Negative 26050 pI have a custom RoutedUICommand that works fine when bound to the Command property of a button.  Yet when bound to a ConextMenu MenuItem on a Listboxs item it does not work.  The CanExecute method is not called, and thus the item is left disabled in the context menu.  The CanExecute is called from the buttons binding however.p  pIn the repo example below, codeCrawlCommands.AddCreditcode is the command.  It is bound to both a button and ListBoxItems.  The Button behaves as expected, but the ListBoxItem does not.  Right clicking on a list box item does show the context menu, and the menu items header is dervied from the Command properly, but the CanExecute is never called, so it never knows the command is valid and thus stays disabled.p  pWhat am I missingp  precodeltUserControl xClassCrawlSpace.TestCommands          xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation          xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml          xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006           xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008           xmlnslocalclrnamespaceCrawlSpace          mcIgnorabled           dDesignHeight300 dDesignWidth300 BackgroundFF020523gt   ltUserControl.CommandBindingsgt     ltCommandBinding CommandlocalCrawlCommands.AddCredit ExecutedExecutedAddCredit CanExecuteCanExecuteAddCreditgt ltUserControl.CommandBindingsgt  ltGridgt      ltGrid.Resourcesgt         ltlocalMockData xKeyTestDatagt     ltGrid.Resourcesgt      ltGrid.Backgroundgt         ltSolidColorBrush ColorDarkGraygt     ltGrid.Backgroundgt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition Height7gt         ltRowDefinition Height3gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt      lt A button with a command, this one works gt      ltButton xNamebutton CommandlocalCrawlCommands.AddCredit ContentAdd Credit Margin10 Grid.Row1 Width177gt      ltListBox xNamelistBox Margin10 BackgroundLightBlue ItemsSourceStaticResource TestDatagt         ltListBox.Resourcesgt             lt Define a context menu gt             ltContextMenu xKeyItemMenugt                 ltMenuItem CommandlocalCrawlCommands.AddCreditBlockgt             ltContextMenugt              lt Sets a context menu for each ListBoxItem in the current ListBox gt             ltStyle TargetTypexType ListBoxItemgt                  lt This menu item will not function even though the button verison above does gt                 ltSetter PropertyContextMenu ValueStaticResource ItemMenugtltSettergt             ltStylegt         ltListBox.Resourcesgt          ltListBox.ItemTemplategt             ltDataTemplategt                 ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                     ltTextBlock TextBinding FirstNamegt                 ltStackPanelgt             ltDataTemplategt         ltListBox.ItemTemplategt     ltListBoxgt ltGridgt codepre  pp
Negative 26050 pHow is Q learning different from value iteration in reinforcement learning I know Q learning is modelfree and training samples are transitions codes,a,s,rcode. But since we know the transitions and the reward for every transition in Q learning, is it not the same as modelbased learning where we know the reward for a state and action pair, and the transitions for every action from a state be it stochastic or deterministic I do not understand the difference.p

Negative 26050 pIm developing an online production management software and I need to keep track of which pages of the app the user has open.p  pIm currently using body onload and onunload events to modify a page specific keyvalue pair in local storage to true or false which I then use to tell if the user has the page open or not.p  pThe problem is that when I do it like this and the user has multiple instances of the same page open and he closes one of them, then the value of the key in the local storage changes to false even when there are still other instances open.p  pI guess I could try to do this with a kind of a counter which is incremented on the pages body onload event and then decremented on the body onunload event. But then there is the problem that the body onload event fires also when refreshing the page so then the user could have none of the pages open and the app would still think that there are pages open.p  pWhat would be a good way to track wich pages of the site or app the user has open.p

Negative 26050 pCurrently I have a huge div that would collapse from the height it automatically generated to the height of the title of the div. i.e. 32px. I have it start out collapsed and then when I click on the div it opens to its full size, displaying all its inner information, and then when I click again, it collapses again. Unfortunately, two things happenp  ol liThe div doesnt completely expand to its full height.li liThe first large img in the div gets resized.li ol  pNow I understand why the latter is happening. It has something to do with the height being a percentage instead of a discrete number, for when I change the number to something like 500px, it works just fine. But I dont want to do that. I emneedem it to remain a percentage for when I need to use, yet resize, large pictures.p  pI also feel this same problem may coincide with the former problem as well, but Im not sure.p  pPlease help me with this.p  pHTMLp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtThis is the titlelttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv classexamplegt ltspan classh2gtDIV Exampleltspangt          ltbr gt         ltimg classbig srchttpwww.greenbookblog.orgwpcontentuploads201203bigdata.jpg gt         ltpgtThis is a big picture.

Its working without an issue except one. p  pReload function doesnt stop page rendering. Because of this, you see unstyled page on the first visit half loaded then refresh comes. Afterwards, everything is fine for the rest of the site since cookie is stored.p  pSo obviously, PHP doesnt provide a function to detect screen type. It must be done through JS. But JS doesnt have the proper tool for reloading  redirecting without loading the page, even code is being used in head. p  pIn short, Im stuck in between. I hope someone may have a suggestion for reloading without showing any content on first load its even displaying inline styling that I put in head. Or displaying standard images on the first load and allowing retina for the rest of browsing experience is the best optionp  pBy the way I tried both reloadtrue and reloadfalse. It didnt help.p  hr  pstrongUPDATE strong Please see Marat Tanalins answer below for possible workarounds and better solutions on retina  HD display image use rather than storing cookie  reloading. p  pAfter I went deeper on this, I realized that generating both retina and standard images may not be the answer all time due to caching methods. In other words, displaying low quality images to visitor on first visit and displaying high quality images after refresh may not work since low quality images and scripts already cached. p  pI decided to go with 1.5x single image size with SVG upload support. Although its not 100 best answer on every aspect, much better option then losing reliability.p  pIm a Wordpress developer and I refer WP Super Cache and similar cache methods but be aware of it may be an issue on other cache methods as well.p

Negative 26050 pSo, I have an graphics automation chain that has been happily running on a headless linux environment using programmaticaly generatedaltered SVGs and PhantomJS currently 1.9.0 as a final rendering engine. I have some dynamic text replacement requirements, and resulting dynamic font scaling and adjustment needs... Ive been using embedded SVG fonts and some crappy embedded javascript, which works fine, except for two thingsp  p1 The client has some requests for fonts with ligatures which the SVG font format does not support due to the fact that it just refferences each character as an svg elementp  p2 We are kicking around a live preview option and would love to just be able to serve the SVG up to the webpage without rendering out a pngjpegwhatever on our server before hand. keep the load down, make the clients CPU do the heavy lifting, all that.p  pIn the interest of these issues I have been playing around with WOFF fonts, as the support for SVG fonts was never VERY good, and now that Chrome doesnt support them any more with the switch to the Blink engine, if I want the client do do my work I need something compatible with as many common browsers as possible...p  pSo heres the issue My automatic scaling fails miserable when I use a WOFF or OFT or TTF font and the fontface function.p  pwhat I have been doing is just embedding the SVG font in my graphic in the defs and referencing with the DOM like any other SVG element.

Obviously this will only work on a browser that supports SVG fonts. The embedded font was created from a fresh download of the OTF with a hrefhttpsgithub.comfontforgefontforgereleasesdownload20150612FontForge20150612Windows.exe relnofollowFontForge For Windows Release 20150612a. I also created a a hrefhttpsapp.box.comsjrfsw97bxami2eer60cndsbdg7w9q05a relnofollowWOFF version of the same fonta the same way all default settings, ignoring the warning about nonstandard ems advance in the TTF definition and added an fontface link with a different name that will point to the WOFF when it is in the same directory as the SVG. By editing the fontfacexxxxxx in the texttextpath element of the SVG you can quickly switch between the embedded SVG font, which works fine the linked WOFF font which scales incorrectly and the system version of the font family ,if installed which perhaps of note, renders slightly differently from the embedded SVG font, but also scales correctlyp  pThis behavior is consistent across all tested browsers Operalatest for Windows 7 64bit, Mozilla Firefoxlatest Linux Ubuntu 14, Chromelatest Windows 78 64bit, Safari 5.1.7 for Windows supports SVG fonts, and PhantomJS 1.9.7 Linux CentOS 6.4 final supports SVG fonts. It is also consistent across all fonts tested many... and font conversion engines squirrelfont, FontForge, Birdfont...p  pAs the self contained SVG is too large to paste into the body, heres a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJawzXs83znzhw relnofollowa link to it pasted into a JSfiddle projecta.p  pYes, I do realize I could solve this by rendering with Apache batik, but 1 Batik is slooooooooooooow. Sooooo sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow... OMG is it slow. 2 I want to be able to offload as much of the CPU load from my server as possible, the exact REVERSE of what batik will do 3 Thats not the point, damnit p  pEDIT Firefox 38 windows now appears to render the WOFF scaling correctly, but only after reloading the page.

Its when I modify the query to look for something other than codedeviceTypecode that I get a problem. But I can see that the query isnt empty The only guess I have at this point is that somehow my PFUser object isnt connected to my device, so even though its looking for my user account it cant find my device. But why would the test code work, thenp

Negative 26050 pI am testing the queue functions in Laravel 5.1. I can make jobs queue up in my db table, called jobs, and I can get them to run successfully. I also created a queue failure table called failedjobs. To test it, inside the jobs table I manipulate the payload data to make it fail then I run the queue worker daemon like so, so it will put the job in the failedjobs table after one failed attemptp  precodephp artisan queuework daemon tries1 queuemyqueue codepre  pWhen the job fails it is immediately put into failedjobs table as expected.p  pFYI I have set things up just like the Laravel 5.1 docs recommendp  pa hrefhttplaravel.comdocs5.1queuesdealingwithfailedjobs relnofollowhttplaravel.comdocs5.1queuesdealingwithfailedjobsap  pI have tried registering my queue failure event in the AppServiceProviders boot method as outlined in the docsp  precodeQueuefailingfunction connection, job, data              LogerrorJob failed          codepre  pI have also tried the failed method inside the actual job scripts like sop  precode           Handle a job failure.                     return void                   public function failed                      Logerrorfailed          codepre  pEither way, neither of these events is triggered when the queued job fails. I see nothing in the logs except for the exception stack trace which I made occur on purpose. Does Laravel 5.1 have a bug here or am I missing somethingp  pUPDATEp  pI have done some more research. When a queue job failure occurs, the logic for handling that failure is in vendorlaravelframeworksrcIlluminateQueueWorker.phpp  precodeprotected function logFailedJobconnection, Job job              if thisgtfailer              thisgtfailergtlogconnection, jobgtgetQueue, jobgtgetRawBody              jobgtdelete              jobgtfailed              thisgtraiseFailedJobEventconnection, job                   return [job gt job, failed gt true]      codepre  pWhat happens is the failed function never executes and it prevents the next function, raisedFailedJobEvent from being called. Its as if the script silently halts when failed is called. Now if I reverse the order of these lines, I can get the raiseFailedJobEvent to fire and if I register a queue event handler in EventServiceProvider.php or AppServiceProvider.php, I can verify it gets fired and I can successfully handle the event. Unfortunately, having failed before raiseFailedJobEvent prevents this event from ever occurring.p  pUPDATEp  pThe problem seems to stem from how I make it fail. If I deliberately corrupt the data in the job queue table, the failed method never gets called. There is a stack trace in the logsp  precodeStack trace 0 [internal function] IlluminateFoundationBootstrapHandleExceptionsgthandleError8, unserialize codepre  pIf I actually go into vendorlaravelframeworksrcIlluminateQueueWorker.php and force it to fail every time it runs in an exceptionless way of course, then failure gets called. The problem, obviously, is how do I know how this queue will behave in a realworld failure If corrupt db data causes a failure yet prevents failure from being called, this is no good. What if there is an actual corruption of db queue data in the real world p

Negative 26050 pI have successfully loaded SoundFont .sf2 files in an AUSampler in my IOS app but any programmed reverb is missing. The SF2s contain parameter data for things like pan, envelope and filter cutoff values. These are all preserved apart from the reverb.p  pBest I can tell, the SF2 format supports internal reverb and chorus units. Are these then missing when loaded in an AUSampler I can certainly create a new Audio unit in my AUGraph and implement a reverb effect to attempt to achieve something similar but a lot will be lost in translation. For example, I will loose the ability to set individually tailored reverberation amounts on a sample by sample basis within my instrument preset. Instead I will be left with just the ability to route my entire sound bank instrument to a master reverb effectp

Negative 26050 pMy question is fairly simple... Ive a codeJPanelcode with a lot of codeJComponentscode inside it and I would like that the panel is ok regardless of screen size, so it can be seen on different monitors. I added scrollbars to bypass this problem but its not enough. Reading some tips on codestackoverflow.comcode and layout managers tutorial, I found out GridBagLayouts weightxweighty functionality and I thought to solve my problem in this way. But there is something more to discover. My JComponents have Font size, border size, hgap and vgap for some jpanels and I would like that even these constants to be dipendent from screen resize. How can I get this goal Thank you in advance.p

Negative 26050 pI have created a PCA solution in Matlab, which works. I am now in the middle of converting it to c, where I use OpenCVs function codecvPCAcode.

But when I want to use the values and look into the size and allocation, I get a size of the input codedatacode, which seems odd, i.e.p  precodecvSize temp eigenvectors.size temp has the same size as data.size codepre  pIn my mind the eigenvectors should be defined by the codenumcomponentscode and in my 3D space, should only be 3x3 size, i.e. 9 elements. Can anybody explain the reasoning behind the data sizes of pca.x.clonep  pAlso what is the correct way of doing matrix operation in opencv and c, based on the documentation it seems like you can use operators with codecvMatcode. Using the above extraction of the pca information can you dop  precodecvMat Z  data  mean according to documentation httpstackoverflow.comquestions10936099matrixmultiplicationinopencv cvMat res  Zeigenvectors codepre  pIt has crashed in my tests on runtime, probably because of the issue with misinterpretationinterpretation  of the size. p  pstrongQuestionstrong The basic question is how to use the pca opencv function correctlyp  pstrongEditstrong Another way that I have tested is to use the following codep  precodecvPCA pcaanalysismat, cvMat, CVPCADATAASROW, numcomponents cvPoint3d cntr  cvPoint3dstaticcastltdoublegtpcaanalysis.mean.atltdoublegt0, 0,         staticcastltintgtpcaanalysis.mean.atltdoublegt0, 1, staticcastltdoublegtpcaanalysis.mean.atltdoublegt0, 2 Store the eigenvalues and eigenvectors vectorltcvPoint3dgt eigenvecsnumcomponents vectorltdoublegt eigenvalnumcomponents for int i  0 i lt numcomponents i      eigenvecs[i]  cvPoint3dpcaanalysis.eigenvectors.atltdoublegt0, inumcomponents,             pcaanalysis.eigenvectors.atltdoublegt0, i  numcomponents  1, pcaanalysis.eigenvectors.atltdoublegt0, inumcomponents  2     eigenval[i]  pcaanalysis.eigenvalues.atltdoublegt0,i  codepre  pWhen I compare the results from the above code with my Matlab implementation then the codecntrcode seems to be plausible under percentage difference. But the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are just zero, when I look at them in the debugger. This seems to go back to my original question of how to extract and understand pcas output.p  pCan anybody clarify what I am missingp

Negative 26050 pThe common pattern for interfacing with codeActionJobcode in Rails is to set up a Job with a codeperformcode method that gets called asynchronously via codeperformnowcode or codeperformlatercodep  pIn the special case of Mailers, you can directly call codedelivernowcode or codedeliverlatercode since codeActionJobcode is well integrated with codeActionMailercode.p  pThe a hrefhttpedgeguides.rubyonrails.orgactivejobbasics.htmlactionmailer relnofollowrails documentationa has the following comments p  precode If you want to send the email now use delivernow UserMailer.welcomeuser.delivernow   If you want to send the email through Active Job use deliverlater UserMailer.welcomeuser.deliverlater codepre  pThe wording makes it seem like codedelivernowcode will emnotem use codeActiveJobcode to send the mail.

Negative 26050 pIve been given the task of changing all our legacy software installation packages to conform to Win 7 and 8. Previously our software would run on XP and Win Server 2003 and would simply be installed into the program files folder and run without any worry.
