Positive 5187 pIn the interest of being more pythonic and being more modular, I want to convert my procedural code to a codeClasscode.  The object of interest here is the idea of a marriage of codehusbandcode and codewifecode, referred to here as codelastnamecode, with some shared and some unique attributes among each spouse.  These attributes are being filled in from a file into a generator object via codeyieldcode.  p  pPart of me wants to perform these two parsing functions codegethusbandcode and codegetwifecode and maybe the final zip function as a Class function that still uses an iterator object to fill in the attributes of codemarriage.firstnamecode, codemarriage.husbandscorecode, codemarriage.wifescorecode, etc.  I would then create methods that would perform further analysis on the information from each codemarriagecode object as it is spit out from the generator.p  pBut part of me is unsure whether the parsing definitions are best kept as methods, since I would be returning codeselfcode which is not the generator that I need for my downstream work...p  precodefrom itertools import izip  def gethusbandhusbandfile     lastname, firstname, husbandscore  , ,      for line in husbandfile.readlines          Parse files to fill out the names, wifescores in wifefile         yield name, husbandscore  def getwifewifefile     lastname, firstname, wifescore  , ,     for line in wifefile.readlines          Parse files to fill out the names, wifescores in wifefile         yield name, wifescore  def makefamilyhusbandfile, wifefile     for husband, wife in izipgethusbandhusbandfile, getwifewifefile         if husband[0]  wife[0]             lastname  husband[0]             parentscore  husband[1]  wife[0]              yield lastname, parentscore         else             raise ExceptionThese two arent married codepre  pWhat do you suppose is the best way to factor this as a class so I can be like codeminscore  marriage.parentscore.mincodep

I edited it to make it as shown above since I didnt mean for the private aspect of it to be the point of discussion. In my real code running on an Arduino, I am using .h and .cpp files and the static member is only intended to be accessed by the class. sstrongI guess Im learning something new though too, as the answers regarding the below code seem to tell me that private static members are the same as public static members ie they can both be modified by anything outside the class if static. That, I didnt know.strongs WRONG, see the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7857989staticmembervariablewhendeclaredprivateanswer by Alok Save herea. More on static member variables a hrefhttpwww.learncpp.comcpptutorial811staticmembervariables relnofollowherea. This line was especially helpful to me emBecause static member variables are not part of the individual objects, you must explicitly define the static member if you want to initialize it to a nonzero value...This initializer should be placed in the code file for the class eg. Something.cpp. In the absense of an initializing line, C will initialize the value to 0.emp  precodeclass MyClass    private   static char c[]   char MyClassc[]  abcde codepre  hr  pOr must I do this instead, for examplep  precodeclass MyClass    private   static char c[10]   char MyClassc[10]  abcde codepre

Positive 5187 pI am using Java and Eclipse to build a program that logs users in by checking usernames and passwords from a SQLite database. I am completely brand new to GUIs and it was pointed out to me in a previous post that my GUI and program logic is not very well structured. With that said, I have successfully logged four different users in and displayed their previously entered information on a form with textFields and comboBoxs. My Query on the SQL database is working great retrieving this information and I have been able to show the user that information in the correct fields. As you can see in my code below, I have a textField called strongUsernameCuststrong. This is where I want to pull my variable to select from in the WHERE clause of my query. The problem is that this textField is located in the Window.Java class and I am trying to use this variable in the CustomerInfo.Java class. I have done a ton of research on gettersetter methods and other ways to pass variables from class to class, but the sheer size and frankly bad logic of my program is making it nearly impossible. How can I pass this variable to the CustomerInfo.Java class Please feel free to correct my class logic as well.

You can see above that I have been using strongString username  Customer3strong to test my query. This is where I need to pass the username variable from the first class so the WHERE clause is dynamic based on the username entered to login. Later, I will also need to pass all the variables I set after the Query into yet another class to compare with if statements, so I will need to yet again pass variables from class to class. If I am on the right track trying to use getters and setters, where in the above code would they be placed and how should I properly call them Thank youp

Positive 5187 pI am working on a VSTO addin for Microsoft Word 20132016, using Visual Studio 2015 and C. This code will open a file and perform many activities. For example, when the user presses the start button, the DOCX will open.p  pOnce the Docx file is open, I want to perform functions, such as modifying styles, changing graphic borders, and so on. In total, I foresee a need for about 1520 of these unique functions.p  pSince I want the code to be easy to read and update, I decided it would make sense to create a brand new class file that performs these activities, but am struggling because each public method I create has no idea the document is open. It seems I have to create a new object that represents the document each time.p  pSo far, I have come up with the following option, which I dont likep  pOn the onclick for the button that kicks off the process, write ALL the business logic within that one method.p  pThis is not ideal because I want each piece of logic to be in its own method. Also, I want my business logic to write back information to the form I am working on, but that external .cls file cannot seem to access the form I read that maybe I can set some getset properties on the form for this, but ultimately, I would like full control of the form.p  pDo you have some recommendations to help me with this challenge I read that regions might help but do not fully understand how that would make it easier to read the code. Also, I am just an accidental programmer and it is not my day job, so hopefully my question makes sense.p  pThank you for any advice you can provide.p

Positive 5187 pIve got a simple program that stores sets of 3 variables using two classes, one called codeStockcode which has the 3 variable definitions, along with basic inspector and mutator functions, and a second function called codeStockManagementcode that has a pointer to codeStockcode and some other functions that do all sorts of things such as creating a dynamic array of codeStockcode, dumping a files data into the array we just made and so on and so forth.p  pEverything works fine in terms of creating the stuff such as the constructor, array, entering data, reading data but when it comes to the destructor, there is a chance that SOMETIMES the program will seg fault at the delete command, and the times it doesnt, the data is still accessable for some reason or another.p  pHeres what I believe to be the important parts of the codep  pHeader filep  precodeclass Stock  private     char tag[5]     int cost     long volume  public      mutator and inspector functions    class StockManagement  private     Stock data     int size  public     StockManagement     StockManagement      other functions  codepre  pCpp file the proper name escapes mep  precode...

Theres a function always called that gets the amount of lines from a file and saves it as codesizecode which is used to allocate the memory, in which data is then entered into the array.p  pThen comes time to use the destructor. The first cout line will always output, as expected. Then theres a chance that either two things happen from then on. We seg fault at the delete line, or we go over it, calling the second cout and somehow printing the same data we printed the first time.p  pSo obviously the data wasnt deleted. But why And why does this only happen sometimes and other times it just straight up seg faultsp

Comparing with another class codeElement2code where I replaced the two big data members by 8byte integers doing nothing tells me that if I can somehow replace the direct data members codel1code and codel2code by pointers of one sort or another to dynamicallyallocated elements elsewhere, Ill already get a big win.p  pFor reference, all member types have both copy and move constructors and can be both copied and moved, but moving them is much much cheaper. codeLargecode and codeOtherLargecode also allocate a lot of memory by themselves, so allocating a bit more isnt necessarily horrible.p  h3Concrete questionh3  pIs it possible, and if so, what is the best way, to replace a direct member object of a class with a pointer to a dynamicallyallocated object elsewhere preserving the behaviour of a direct member as closely as possible w.r.t construction, destruction, member variable access etc If I use a codestduniqueptrltLargegtcode naively, I assume Ill have to dereference it half the timetake care of copying specially Ideally Id like the new member object to behave just as if the old, big member object was still there.p
Negative 5187 pMy company has developed a long standing product using MFC in Visual C as the defacto standard for UI development. Our codebase contains ALOT of legacyarchaic code which must be kept operational. Some of this code is older than me originally written in the late 70s and some members of our team are still on Visual Studio 6.p  pHowever, a conclusion has thankfully been reached internally that our product is looking somewhat antiquated compared to our competitors, and that something needs to be done.p  pI am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out new technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins.p  pI have been using C with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI wont require much interop with the legacy C codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future.p  pThe alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net...p  pSo, which do I pick Were a small team so my recommendation will quite probably be accepted as a future direction for our development  I want to get it right.p  pIs MFC dead Is CWinforms the way forward Is there anything else Im totally missing Help greatly appreciatedp

Here Windows follows 8.3 file naming standard means turbo c can only read files with name length of 8 characters and extension of 3 characters.

So here the problem is as told above windows is giving some other name to hi.ttcn so my program is not able to open that file saying File name does not exists because I am giving the same argument string hi.ttcn to fopen. So how can I get the windows allocated file name at run time for the given argument string  means I want to get the string HIBDS1.TTC when HI.TTCN is given.p blockquote

Negative 5187 pI work with several different databases and find myself trying connecting to these quite often to test a query. I use the database specific tools to connect to the DB and run the query.p  pI find these DB specific tools like SQL Query Analyzer SQLServer, Oracle Enterprise Manager, MySQL Query Browser to be quite clunky and slow when it comes to running quick queries and looking at data directly.

Negative 5187 pAt my company we have a really annoying problem with our linker ld 2.17. It links very very slow on a relatively fast system Core Duo, 2GB Ram and I dont really now how to fix this. It takes about five to ten minutes to compile a relatively big project which takes about 5 seconds to link on my Gentoo system. p  pPersonally i think it is a huge productivity killer, at least for me. We tried to use a more recent version of ld 2.19 but without any success. I asked in debian on freenode, but this problem seems to be very unique. I did not find any information about similar problems on the net. It only happens when we build with debug symbols. I changed the gcc debuginformation flags to g, g3, and ggdb, but that did not help either.p  pSo my question is, how do you profile and debug a linker I have never done anything like it, and I am unable to find any documentation about it. Basically any reasonable gprof gmon.out would be very helpful, as I could ask the binutils developers about a concrete problem. I am just completely oblivious about this.p  pEdit We fixed our problem switching to debian lenny on most systems. Thanks for the answersp

We originally had all the squares as GEF objects, but because of the large volume of them being shown, we found that this did not scale very well and the view took a very long time to open. We then changed it so that only the large squares are Figures and we then draw the smaller squares using the graphic in paintFigure.p  pThe problem that we are running into is that we still want the tooltip to change depending on which small square you are hovering over.

I found that people had the same problem and they resolved it a hrefhttpwww.linuxquestions.orgquestionsslackware14nosqlite3.soinusrlibpython2.5libdynload599027 relnofollowherea. To solve my problem I have to install codesqlite3code and recompile Python. I also found out that the problem can be solved by building from source and moving the library to codeusrlibpython2.5libdynloadcode.p  pAs I have been told to here, I have to install sqlite from the source and copy newly compiled files to my Python directory nothing was said about recompile Python. Well, I have installed sqlite and now I have to copy something to my codelibdynloadcode directory.p  pI am not sure what exactly I should copy. In my codelibdynloadcode directory I have only .so files. And in my codesqlite3.6.18code I do not have any code.socode files it makes me suspicious. I had this problem since I did not have codesqlite3.socode file in codelibdynloadcode. By compilation of sqlite I got some new files for example codesqlite3.ocode and codesqlite3.locode but codenot sqlite3.socode.p  pP.S. Some details br1. I use Python  2.6.2 which I installed locally. br2. I do not have root permissions. br3. I had already sqlite installed globally on the machine by root. br4. I just installed sqlite locally. br5.

After a whole lot of research since yesterday, I would out now that the process that the second insert is running on is block by the first inserts process.p  pI found this out by running codeSPWHO2code in sql server with the program was running.p  pMeanwhile, there is a onemany relationship between the two table involved in the insertion process. The first insert performs its operation on the parent table while the second will be on the child table.p  pstrongWhenever i remove the relationship constraint between the two tables the transaction goes through, but doesnt when the constraint is onstrong.p  pstrongMy question is how to unblock the second process which is blocked by the first insertstrongp
Negative 5187 pIm writing a replacement for a Visual Studio AddIn which weve got from a third party.  Their AddIn has one function which Im having trouble replacing however.  It interfaces with another program of theirs which we still need by starting it, telling it the PID of Visual Studio and letting the other program call back their Visual Studio AddIn via COM.p  pSo, question, how can I reverse engineer the conversation between the AddIn and the other app  I dont have the source for the third party AddInApp but I do have the legal rights to do what Im doing so reverse engineering isnt a problem.p

Thanks.p  pEditp  pI now have a way to read the contained data with the WMGETTEXT message, however, I still need a persistent nameID that I can be sure will not change from instance to instance.  One way I can think of for doing this is to take the handle, find the position of the control on the window, and then get the handle from the position from then on.  Another way is to determine a static ID for the control and then use that to get the handle from then on.  The new scope of my problem is how to implement either of these.  Any Ideasp

Negative 5187 pI would like to know, what limitations there are for how far one can go in terms of replacing UI components of current touch screen smart phones, in particular iPhone, Blackberry and android based phones.p  pWhat I would like to do is create a custom UI for dialing out and incoming calls. p  pI have some experience with Blackberry development. The theme builder for it, can be used to customize certain items on the incoming call screen, but it doesnt look like that you can increase the size of answer button. I know Blackberry also gives you access to all the phone APIs, but Im not sure that you can create your own UI that can gain preference over the Blackberry incoming call screen. And if you try to customize the incoming call screen by adding any buttons to it, they would be rendered as pictures. p  pI could possibly design a complete UI for android, since different manufactures have different UI for android based phones. p  pCan I do what I want to do using iPhone, Blackberry or android Or any other phone for that matter I am guessing may be for Nokia phones using Qt, but I prefer the 3 platforms I listed. p  pThanks for all your help. p

Negative 5187 pI start two remote actors on one host which just echo whatever is sent to them.

Negative 5187 pThis question is about the best way to emtemporarilyem and programatically keep new records of two databases in sync, having very different schemas, and ignoring the old outdated and no longer required records.p  pI work on a company that provides TV programming information for guides, newspapers and websites.p  pI have an old system that has several limitations and is being replaced by a new one.p  pDifferent clients take the data in different formats xml, sql, txt, even printready PDF and in different ways push, pull, partial dumps, simple exports, man assisted exports like the PDF version, etc.  Some exports are generated once a month, others more than once a day.p  pThe problem is that several clients have to rely on the data from the old system until the new one is fully developed and loaded, and the staff mantaining the data cant have both databases in sync because it would require a lot of additional work, but switching systems overnight seems impossible given the size of the project.p  pWe dont want to make a full inport of the data from the old database to the new one, because most of it is already not necessary, and have a lot of garbage ie, duplicate records with different detail level, old airings info that we only need as an archive.p  pWe want the new records inserted in both databases, and the old ones being edited, copied to the new database as well.p  pWe are about to start the development of the new system using Symfony with Doctrine, and Ive decided we could design a set of ORM proxy classes that should have the same interface than a simple Doctrine ORM set of classes, but keep the sync going between two other set of classes the ones that interface with the new system and the ones that interface with the old one.  Eventually the old DB should be discarded along with the proxy classes, and the Doctrine ORM classes that connect directly to the new DB should take that place, as if the old system would never existed.p  pIts a long shot, and Im not completely confident with the approach.br Do anyone have experience with this kind of projectbr Do you know of any common pitfall in this approach, or some other solution that could fit this situationp

Negative 5187 pI have been looking for an elegant solution to converting a submit button to a button. In Internet Explorer you cannot simply change the type of an input.

Why is thisp  h1Updateh1  pI want buttons codeltinput typeinput...gtcode to submit when I dont have javascript turned on, and I want to execute javascript instead of submitting when javascript is turned on by way of changing the input type to prevent postbacks and to attach event handlers.

Negative 5187 pLets say I have peachz as a string, and eachzp and pahezc as attempts used for comparison.p  pIm looking for an algorithm that outputs the level of disorder of the array, regarding the relative order of the occurrences. In the following example I describe the problem with my current algorithm. Im summing up the differences in the attempt position of each character against the ones on the original string.p  pHeres an example imagebr img srchttpi51.tinypic.com1zz2c10.png althttpi51.tinypic.com1zz2c10.pngp  peachzp has the same order of characters, except for the P. Because P has moved to the first position, every other character is seen as being one position out of place. eachzp will output a disorder degree of 10, while the totally scrambled pahezc attempt will output 8. This is incorrect. Things like Hamming or Levenshtein distance do not take these order sequences into account either.p  pMy question is Is there an algorithm I can use to output the disordersimilarity of the strings, considering the relative order of their characters p  pThis should not be dictionaryrelated, since the strings arent words and do not have any lexical meaning. If it helps, characters will are also be unique on each string.p  ptiap  pedit Ill try to explain my situation in a different way, trying to further detail itp  ul lipThe strings are always of the same lengthpli lipThe strings have always the same chars eg. if the original were ors, other strings could only be ors, osr, sor, ros, sro or rso  same length and same charspli lipThe chars are always unique on each stringpli lipThe strings are not words and have no lexical meaning at allpli lipI need the algorithm to take the order sequence into account. If the original string is peachz, eachzp is ordered almost exactly in the same way  only p is out of place. This should be more similar to peachz than pahezc, that is much more scrambled, and in all directions i feel this direction notion could be relevant to the solution.pli lipeapchz should also be less scrambled than eachzp.

Negative 5187 pWhats the best library to use to convert the HTTP POST string received from a browser into a Ruby hash I dont want to use the large railsbased libraries. I am using codeeventmachinecode and codeevmahttpservercode, and want to include the lightest library possible that will decode and convert the params string.p  pNote I dont need a webserver.

Negative 5187 pI have some computers on a network, the network is somehow serial, I mean computers are connected to each other via radio transmitters and in a line, if a radio transmitter goes off or face some problems other computers are not accessible. the architecture would be something like thisbr RT  radio transmittersbr codeComputer1ltRT1gtComputer2ltRT2gtComputer3ltRT3gt....ltRTN1gtComputerNcode  p  pDistances between computers are about 20 to 30 kilometers and network speed varies between 0 and 10Kbps. computers are running windows XP and a very high loaded program 2GB of ram, 90 CPU Usage are always running on them, all computers IP addresses are known and static.p  pIm going to write a program which is going to run on every computer and get commands or packages to run or install and update on that computer. because of the low speed network and high risk of disconnection sending data between computers should have resume capability. the question is how should I implement that using .NET remoting or use simple network sockets and TCP which one is better feel free to explain your suggestion or approaches you think suites this solution. p
Negative 5187 pA lot of times the answer is merely when I want things to be allocated on a stack instead of the heap.. assuming I dont know what the stack and the heap are and please dont try to explain it here, when exactly should I be using structs instead of classesp  pHere is the answer Ive been giving out, but please tell me if Im wrong or falling short of a better answerp  pI create structs usually when I have enums that I want to add more data to. For instance, I might start with a simple enump  precodepublic enum Colors  Blue, Green, Red  codepre  pThen if I need to store more aspects of this data I go to structsp  precodepublic struct Color      string Name     int HexValue     string Description   public class Colors      public static Color Blue     public static Color Red     public static Color Green     static Colors              Blue  new ColorBlue, 1234, A light blue       codepre  pThe point is... similar to enums, I use structs just when I want to declare a bunch of types.p
Negative 5187 pI have a database with many single isolated tables, and I need to fill their contents to their Entities.p  pCurrently I have for each and every table something like thisp  precodetry      usingDBContext context  new DBContext              var vehicleTypes  context.VehicleTypes         return vehicleTypes       catchException ex  handle error  codepre  pWhat Im seeking for is best described as something like thisp  precodevar vehicleTypes  context.GetEntitySetVehicleEntity var buildingTypes  context.GetEntitySetBuildingEntity codepre  pwhere codeVehicleEntitycode, codeBuildingEntitycode ... are entities from entity model. I know I dont have this option explicitly, but something in that similar way would be nice.

A member of the type, Id, does not have a corresponding column in the data reader with the same name.codep  pand thats true  the names dont match  but I figured it wouldve mapped the table from query based on edmx definition How can I get this rightp
Negative 5187 pMy objective is to prevent direct user access to the database server. One way is to create a WCF service or web service in the middle between the front end application and the database server. p  pFirst of all, the users will be authenticated to the application. Subsequently the application will connect through the WCF service to perform business logic operations. The WCF service will perform the database related operations by using one windows account. This will prevent other users to directly access the database server, since the permission will only be granted to specific one windows account.p  pHere are my questions  Even though the database access is only granted to one windows account and the WCF will use this windows account to perform database related operations, is it possible to mark all database related operations with the credential of the logged in user   p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr Thanks for the replies.

Negative 5187 pI have a WCF service that talks to MSMQ. When I run the service in VS2010s service test client interface it can place the messages in the proper queues and everything is fine. When I host the WCF service in IIS7 and call the service from my web application all the messages go into the Transactional deadletter queue. p  pI setup the application pool and site the site hosting the WCF service with identities that I know have specific access to the queues.p  pIs there something else I can check or that I am doing wrongp  pUpdate Well, I think there is something else going on. I created a SUPER simple service that can read and write from the queues without fail. I jsut need to dig deeper and find out. Thanks to everyone who has looks, but I will keep this open so I can report back or if someone may have other ideas.

Negative 5187 pSuppose a class codeYcode publicly inherits a class codeXcode. Is it possible for a class codeZcode to privately inherit codeYcode while publicly inheriting codeXcodep  pTo make this clearer, suppose codeXcode defines public methods codex1code and codex2code. codeYcode inherits codeXcode, overrides codex1code and provides a method codeycode. Does C allow for a third class codeZcode to subclass codeYcode in such a way that codeYcodes implementation of codex1code and codeycode are privately available to it, while the outside world only sees it inheriting codeXcode publicly, i.e. having only a single public method codex2codep
Negative 5187 plets say I have a class that behaves as an int to the outside world, but in fact is a mutable object that has a fixed place within several structures. if n is my object, I can update it now by writing coden.update34code, but I find Im always wanting to write coden  34code instead. Ive glanced over a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgreferencedatamodel.html relnofollowhttpdocs.python.orgreferencedatamodel.htmla, and dont see anything like an 9595assign9595 or 9595value9595 attribute that would let me trap the codecode operator and allow me to update my object rather than assign an int to the variable n, throwing my object away. better still, when a mutable is inside a tuple codet  m, ncode, I would like to update my mutable with codet[1]  34code, but Python sees that as attempting to modify an immutable.p  pso I guess the answer would be, based upon what little of that document I was able to grok, that what Im attempting is not Pythonic. so if I cant do it the way I want, what would be the next best thing such that if someone has to maintain my code someday, it wont be overly offensive.p

Negative 5187 pI know that if your DLL  static links against a different version of the runtime then it creates its own heap. It will also if it is instructed to make a heap.

Negative 5187 pIm implementing a logging solution with Log4Net for a Windows NT Service. I can flip a switch in a configuration file to start logging information to the file system.

Negative 5187 pI have a question about TrueType Fonts and their installation in the client side. I know they can be installed in the operating system manually.

Negative 5187 pI love the idea of Qt, however I use it not only for open source but closed source development. This isnt a real problem because I just license under the LGPL and distribute the DLLs needed. Ive run into a problem though unfortunately. p  pThe compiled statically linked executable is 4.36 MB. Not too shabby. p  pThe compiled dynamically linked executable is 250 KB, however I also must include almost 35 MB in DLL files with the installation. This is REALLY tacky and no matter how I look at it I cannot justify the sizeuse ratio. This, and I simply cannot afford a commercial license. Talk about price gouging start up developers.p  pAnyway, you see my problem. My program performs only one function. 35 MB is too large. Unfortunately Ive heard horror stories about how poorly maintained WxWidgets is but given my situation Im afraid Ill be forced to use it. Can anyone recommend me a alternative that is nearly as powerful but wont result in the bloat an LGPL compiled Qt executable brings Thank you p

Negative 5187 pIm working with an application that uses and manages a large amount of OSGi services and implementations for each service, with properties, dynamism and so. Using the command line of the Equinox console is useful, with commands like emservicesem or emlist cem . However, it is difficult to see specific implementations of services, and obtain a current snapshot of bounded or available services to consume. For example, you can see if the bundle references are satisfied, but you cant see which are the implementations of those satisfied references although there are another mechanisms, of course.p  pSo, the idea is to find a GUI with organized information for example, using graphs to increase the performance when you are developing in OSGi. Maybe there is one GUI in Eclipse plugin perspective, but I cant find it.p  pIf you dont know anything like this, Ive in mind to create my own for my thesis p
Negative 5187 pAmazon recently announced support for Oracle in their RDS product line a hrefhttpaws.amazon.comrdsoracle relnofollowhttpaws.amazon.comrdsoracleap  pI was wondering if anyone has used this, or if there would be a compelling reason to migrate my data from MySQL to Oracle.  I dont run a supermassive data installation, and previously, the cost  hassle of getting an Oracle license blocked me from evaluating the product.

Negative 5187 pWe have built a WPF executable. p  pI want to launch this executable within a child AppDomain. p  pSo there will be a host AppDomain called the boot loader, which launches the WPF app in a separate AppDomain. p  pThe WPF application can trigger an update for itself that downloads new files into a temporary folder, and then needs to signal the boot loader to unload it and update the WPF dlls  files.

Its called within the WPF Domain, so I cant restart the domain. I get an codeAppDomainUnloadedExceptioncode when trying to call recreate the WPF AppDomain and execute the assembly. p  pNext I read that unload aborts all of the threads in the domain, so I tried creating a new thread for WPF Domain and joining the main thread to it.

The only thing that really bothers me is why do we have to initialize instance NSMutableArrays that way  i found this was the emonlyem way to get them to actually work.p
Negative 5187 h3Introh3  pSo Ive been experimenting with the ObjectiveC lowlevel runtime APIs defined in codeltobjcruntime.hcode and following a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceObjCRuntimeRefReferencereference.html relnofollowApples documentationa. You can see the results of my playing a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1073294filearray.m relnofollowin this gista.p  h3Problemh3  pIve been able to dynamically create a simple Hello World through ObjectiveC through only the lowlevel runtime APIs and C see the gist above. It works. Now Im trying to dynamically create a codeNSMutableArraycode using the same technique. Heres a snippet of the codep  precodeClass nsmutablearray  objcgetClassNSMutableArray  id array  classcreateInstancensmutablearray, 0 id arrayAfterInit  objcmsgSendarray, selregisterNameinit   get the count objcmsgSendarrayAfterInit, selregisterNamecount codepre  pBut its giving me an errorp  pcodeTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason  [NSArray count] method only defined for abstract class.  Define [NSMutableArray count]codep  pBut it works properly if I change the middle part of the snippet above to readp  precodeid arrayAfterInit  objcmsgSendnsmutablearray, selregisterNamearrayWithCapacity, 10 codepre  pThis is sort of confusing me since they should be equivalent. The first snippet should be equivalent to calling code[[NSMutableArray alloc] init]code which works as ObjectiveC syntax, but not when calling these C functions.p  pAny light shed on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advancep

Negative 5187 pI am tacking a large refactor of a project, and I had asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7040923dynamicformcreationinaspnetcthis questiona to confirmunderstand the direction I should go in and I think I got the answer that I wanted, which is not to throw away years worth of code. So, now begins the challenge of refactoring the code. Ive been reading Martine Fowler and Martin Feathers books, and they have a lot of insight, but I am looking for advice on the ultimate goal of where I want the application to be. p  pSo to reiterate the application a little bit, its a dynamic forms system, with lots of validation logic and data logic between the fields. The main record that gets inserted is the set of form fields that is on the page. Another part of it is Actions that you can do for a person. These Actions can differ client by client, and there are hundreds of Actions. There is also talk that we can somehow make an engine that can eventually take on other similar areas, where a person can be something else such as student, or employee. So I want to build something very decoupled. We have one codebase, but different DBs for different clients. The set of form fields on the page are dynamic, but the DB is not  it is translated into the specific DB table via stored procs. So, the generic set of fields are sent to the stored proc and the stored proc then decides what to do with the fields figure out which table it needs to go to. These tables in fact are pretty static, meaning that they are not really dynamic, and there is a certain structure to it.p  pWhat Im struggling specifically is how to setup a good way to do the dynamic form control page. It seems majority of the logic will be in code on the UIaspx.cs page, because its loading controls onto the webpage. Is there some way I can do this, so it is done in a streamlined fashion, so the aspx.cs page isnt 5000 lines long I have a FORM object, and one of the properties is its FIELDS. So this object is loaded up in the business layer and the Data layer, but now on the fron end, it has to loop through the FIELDS and output the controls onto the page. Also, someway to be able to control the placement would be useful, too  not sure how do get that into this model....p  pAlso, from another point of view  how can I really get this into an objectorientedstructure Because technically, they can create forms of anything. And those form fields can represent any object. So, for example, today they can create a set of form fields, that represent a person  tomorrow they can create a set of form fields that represent a furniture.

Negative 5187 pThis question concerns the reflection mechanisms of the java programming language.p  pI have an interfacep  precodepackage A  public interface MyInterface       public boolean doSomethingObject... parameters  codepre  pI have several implementation classes for this interface. Here some examplesp  precodepackage B import A.  abstract class BaseImplementation implements MyInterface       private Object field      protected BaseImplementation           super           public void setFieldObject aField           field  aField           public Object getField           return field       codepre  hr  precodepackage B import A.  public class ConcreteImplementation extends BaseImplementation       public ConcreteImplementation           super           ...       The concrete implementation provides an implementation for all      inherited abstract methods. Apart from this no other methods      are overridden.      This concrete class provides accessor methods for all of its own      private fields.      ...  codepre  pedited As a sidenote this may not be relevant to the issue concerning the reflection mechanismp  pIm implementing a complex ruleset. One drawback of this ruleset is that there are lots of interdependencies between objects. Thus there is a need to define the general behaviour with interfaces. When implementing one part of the ruleset you have to consider the behaviour of another, not yet implemented, part.p  pDifferent implementations of an interface require different resourcesobjects to work properly. To reduce duplicate code I use the abstract parent classes. These abstract classes are not used outside of their packages.p  pWhen instantiating and initializing an instance of a concrete implementation class I resort to reflection mechanisms. For this purpose I have a utility class which resides in a separate package where I have to specify the desired classname, which field gets which value i.e. the appropriate setter methods will be looked up then and the order in which the setter methods are called.p  pI have two different development environments and on each a different version of java is installed 1.5.x and 1.6.x. This is mainly used for cross checking the behaviour of the implementation.p  pInstantiating an instance of a concrete implementation class works in both environments. But the initialization fails with the older java version. Somehow the public setter method of the base class the base class has a default visibility cannot be accessed. The newer java version has no issues with accessing the setter method.p  pOne workaround I found is to change the visibility of the base class default  public. The question is, is there a way to keep the visibility default and still call the setter method with reflection mechanismsp

Negative 5187 pI have a form with a variable number of textboxes, and when I click Save the submit button, I want it to remove the empty ones and then save the form without the empty boxes.  p  pBut its only halfworking.  When I click Save, the empty boxes are visually removed. Moreover, usually theres a validation error when boxes are left empty, but with removeEmptyBoxes there is no validation error so I know the boxes are somehow successfully removed before submit.  But when the page refreshes, the empty boxes reappear.  On the other hand, if I divide it into two buttons and use one button to removeEmptyBoxes and then click the other button to Save, that works fine and the deleted boxes stay deleted.p  pIm sure I can get round this in a completely different way, but its frustrating that it doesnt work the way I want it to.  Is there any way to do thisp  pMy form is made using Ajax.BeginForm.

Negative 5187 pI feel like this has to be a common error state for serial comms but I have yet to see a good solution.p  pI have set a serial port set to non blocking and I have disabled flow control.  I then use Select to determine when I can write the port.  Im trying to write large buffers larger than the page size, 4k, which I think is the amount of software buffering given to the port.  The first part of the write will go through but then I am blocking trying to write the rest if the serial connection is broken or the end consumer is turned offrebooting.  Ive thought about writing smaller chunks of data but I feel like eventually I will fill the buffer and run into this case again.  Is there perhaps a way to query the available buffer left before writing  A way to change the buffer size without recompiling the kernelp  pMy goal is to have a way to timeout failed writes so I can flush and notify the user.  I dont want the tail end of a failed message to go through right when a device is coming back.  The serial settingsbaud, stop bits etc. may also be changing over time and I dont want them changed while I may have a write hanging out.p  pIve determined that I can send a thread a sigusr1 signal and that will cancel an ongoing write but this doesnt seem all that graceful.  Perhaps this is the prefered method  Also Ive looked into using aiowrite but Ive never used it before and I dont know its limitations.  p  pIf anyone has a good solution for timing out failed writes Id be interested in hearing them.  Thanks.p  pEDIT Ive done more investigation and my question was not totally correct.  I was using psuedo serial ports and writing to them behaved differently than real serial ports.  The question would still pertain to if you had hardware flow control enabled or you had to use psuedo serial ports.p

Negative 5187 pSo, Im working with a really old system which uses a persons mysql database credentials to authenticate to a web site the database was originally only accessed from the command line, but is now accessed from a php frontend. Because of some internal reasons and to preserve the users history, I have to leave the old authentication intact. Ive been charged with adding openid authentication to this system. Somehow I need to be able to retrieve a users mysql username and password upon logging into the site through openid using the Zend framework, by the way. Ive thought of simply requiring registration at the first login, where the user must provide their mysql credentials, but Id rather not store the password plain text. Ive also considered blanking everyones mysql passwords, and just setting the users mysql username manually rather than having the user provide this, since they could provide any username. This is turning into a security nightmare. Does anyone have any suggestions for alternativesp  pThis is running on a Linux server, by the way. Also, I cant use mysql pluggable authentication because the mysql version is 5.0 pluggable authentication requires mysql 5.5, and no, I cant update it.p

Negative 5187 pI have been doing some research with neural networks and the concept and theory as a whole makes sense to me. Although the one question that sticks out to me, which I havent been able to find an answer to yet, is how many neurons should be used in a Neural Net. to achieve properefficient results. Including Hidden Layers, neurons per Hidden Layer, etc. Do more neurones necessarily more accurate results while being more taxing on the system or will less neurons still be sufficient Is there some sort of governing rule to help determine those numbers Does it depend on the type of traininglearning algorithm that is being implemented into the neural net. Does it depend on the type of datainput that is being presented to the networkp  pIf it makes it easier to answer the questions, I will most likely be using feedforwarding and backpropogation as the main method for training and prediction.p  pOn a side note, is there a prediction algorithmfiring rule or learning algorithm that is generally regraded to as the bestmost practical, or is that also dependant on the type of data being presented to the networkp  pThanks to anyone with any input, its always appreciated p  pEDIT Regarding the C tag, that is the language in which Ill be putting together my neural network.

Negative 5187 pIm running Python 2.7 on a Win32 OS, but im hoping to write platformindependent code. Im trying to use Python to interact in realtime with a Java program i wrote, and figured pipes would be the best way to do this. My Python script is calling Java as a subprocess. Essentially, Java is the GUI and Python is the back end. I dont want to use Jython or wxPython because i only want to be dependent upon the standard libraries each language provides. Trying to set up communication between the two has been terrible. I can send a message from the parent Python script to the child Java class usingp  precodeprocess.stdin.writemsg process.stdin.flush codepre  pbut reading Javas output has not worked. I usep  precodeprocess.stdout.read codepre  pbut apparently this blocks forever if theres nothing to read. And codeprocess.communicatecode is off limits because it doesnt do anything until the subprocess terminates. According to my research, a common method people use to get around this problem is to use threads although someone suggested appending a newline when writing  didnt work, but being new to Python and threading in general i have no idea how that would look. Ive tried looking over the standard librarys codesubprocess.pycode source but that hasnt helped. Is there a way to see if stdout is empty, at least If not, how do i accomplish thisp

Negative 5187 pI am working on a little HTMLJavaScriptCSS3 project for fun. Im basically trying to make a wheel that rolls around in the browser window. To control the wheel Im using keyup and keydown events for the cursor keys left and right turn the wheel and up and down roll it forward or backward.p  pIve got it working pretty well so far, but there are two major glitches.

When I do this theres a pause in the movement before it registers both events and keeps rolling.p  pThats one of the problems, the main problem is that, once Ive performed the previous action and then wheel is at a desirable angle, if I let go of the right cursor key the browser registers both keys as released and the wheel comes to a stand still.

Negative 5187 pI have been searching the web and i came up with NO results while it seems so convenient to havep  pBackground information With basic netlogon batchfiles i used a write a checkfile in a temp folder to check if this script has already ran so it wouldnt take up too much time. But these days we do everything in policy.p  pA while back ive made a small vbs that adds an outlook signature with user information from AD. Currently users run this script manually because it can only be run successfully after the outlook profile was created. I can ofcourse run my VBS script with EVERY logon and check if the signature file already exists and quit if it does... but there has to be a better way ..i hope..p  pThis is what i would like to do Use GPO WMI Filtering to check if a file exists i.e. Select  From CIMDatafile Where Name lt APPDATAoutlook.v1. If true launch my vbs. Inside my script i will check if the outlook profile exists and run the rest of the script and create the outlook.v1 file at the end of my script.p  pThis way only the very limited amount of users that do not have outlook will be running this vba every time.p  pThe syntax p  precodeSelect  From CIMDatafile Where Name ltgt APPDATAoutlook.v1 or Select  From CIMDatafile Where Name ltgt cusersusetheusernameoftheonecurrentlyloggin inoutlook.v1 codepre  pIs ofcourse wrong.. so the real question is How do i refer to a user based setting in WMI filtering..p

Negative 5187 pI have a search indexer indexing specific pages within my application.  The urls we build for indexing are aggregates of content that are served within other pages in the application.

The indexer returns that page as relevant content as it has all of topic 123s content.  when a user not search indexer ip goes to topics123mytopicsearchindex, they should be routed to topics123mytopic.p  pEssentially, whats the best way to strip searchindex off the request for everyone but a known IP addressp  pThis can probably be accomplished with .htaccess in apache, but id prefer to keep this within my application so I dont have to modify files on the servers if the indexer ip address ever changes.p  pThank youp  pMattp
Negative 5187 pI have a class in my Android app, called Main.java, to validate a user login user name  password against the data in my server. At first, I succeeded I used an AsyncTask thread to do it plus a library which handles the Http connection, call HttpPostAux.java in fact, I found the librarys code here in this forum. In the onPostExecute method of AsyncTask, I was creating and starting a new activity instead of modifying the current one and it worked.p  pBut now I want to do things different. I want to save the validated data user name  password into a SQLite table in the AsyncTask thread and then in the UI thread, recover that data and use it to open the mentioned activity. The insertion occurs but when Im trying to access the database from UI thread it says that the table is empty. So I looked in the logcat and I found that UI thread executes before AsyncTask thread.p  pSo my question is how to insert data in the AsyncTask thread and then recover it inside UI thread Can anybody help here Im kind of lostp  pI will appreciate a code example Thanks in advance Greetings from Venezuelap
Negative 5187 pWe have a situation where our internal security requires that our developers not have knowledge of the usernames and passwords for our production databases.p  pWe are trying to move toward using web.config transformations to reduce the number of manmade errors that occur during deployment from manually editing the web.config files.

Depending on the value of the codeeTagcode parameter being passed in, the following will occurp  pcodeeTagcode  Wdatetime20100817T233A433A26.1913755Z  assuming this eTag does not match, then I will get a 412.  Perfect, that is what I am looking for.p  pcodeeTagcode  WWrongETag  I will receive a DataServiceRequestException with a status code of 400.  The only error message is invalid inputp  pcodeeTagcode  wrongETag  same as abovep  pIt seems that the azure table service demands an eTag of a more strict format than the HTTP standard requires.  All that should be required is a quoted string with an optional W prefix if it is weak.  Does anybody know the specific format required for the Azure table service  SideNote Oddly enough, using the above ETags with Azures Blob service behaves as expected.p

Negative 5187 pIm looking for a tool that would help me read a stronglargestrong amount of C source code for a complex product and understand relationships between components and datatype and have those relationshipts diagrammed and noted.

After doing the initial checks and pre requisites, i have to introduce 5 threads based on the sql tables rows. say for example, if my table consist of 1000 rows, then i will have to split up the rows and assign equally to all 5 threads, where in this case, i will do the split and assign creating a datatable 200 rows to each thread and then all 5 threads would call the SP at the same time with the datatable.

Negative 5187 pI am trying to create custom syntax highlighting for Kivy .kv files in the Geany editor. Although the specific filetype seems irrelavant to the issue Im having, as any efforts I make at getting syntax highlighting to work for a custom filetype results in a completely nonhighlighted file. I believe I have done my homework on this, and nothing seems to work.p  pI have added the following to .configgeanyfiletypeextensions.confp  precodeKivy.kv codepre  pI also have a custom type definition file named filetypes.Kivy.conf in .configgeanyfiledefs. I have tried basing this file off several of the stock type definition files in usrsharegeany and the file never gets any syntax highlighting applied in Geany. Right now, just for experimentations sake, my filetypes.Kivy.conf file looks like thisp  precode For complete documentation of this file, please see Geanys main documentation [settings]  default extension used when saving files extensionkv   single comments, like  in this file commentsingle  [keywords]  all items must be in one line primarysize canvas secondarypos size  [indentation] width4  0 is spaces, 1 is tabs, 2 is tab amp spaces type0 codepre  pThis is very loosly based on the stock XML definition file, but like I said Ive tried many other stock files. In many cases I only changed the extension value to kv and still no highlighting was applied, ieven though going to DocumentSet Filetype in Geany and choosing virtually any random filetype besides my custom entry would yeild some sort of highlighting within my .kv file.i This is even the case when using the unmodified contents of a stock definition which otherwise works fine on my .kv file when specifically selected in Geanyp  piAlso, the Kivy filetype is listed and selected by default in DocumentSet Filetype within Geanyi, so I must be doing something right herep  pI realize this similar question has been asked, but the solutions seem irrelavent to my case, as Ive tried every related topic on this and many other sites. bMy Geany version is 1.22b and Im running Arch Linux.

Ill summarise Store line ID numbers in tetrahedron structure and then set pointers to point at the correct Vertex. p  pPlease bear in mind that I am no programmer I need this to generate a Voronoi diagram. Also would it be simpler if instead of storing the vertices that makeup the tetrahedrons, I stored the edges as I believe I will actually require edge data rather than vertex data for the generation of the Voronoi D   I have spent my Sunday working on this and its not working and I havent got a clue why.

Negative 5187 pIm trying to rewrite an OO PHP site that loosely follows an MVC structure so it uses namespaces  and want to follow PSR0.p  pIn the current site I have a class called APP which is full of static methods that I call all over the place to handle things such as getting config data eg codeAPPgetconfigkeycode. p  pObviously with namespacing, I would need to call codeTheNameSpaceAppgetconfigkeycode. I use this class frequently, so want to avoid having to prefix the namespace every time I use it. I do call methods in it from within other classes, which would usually be under a subnamespace  so changing the namespace at the top of the file wont really work.p  pSo, I guess my question is, what is the easiest way to have a global class with methods that I can call anywhere without having to prefix with the namespace each timep
Negative 5187 pIve created a Java application that is basically an interface to a MySQL database. It helps organize and keep track of data.  We are using it in my workplace with no problem  I have exported it from Eclipse as a jar file and given everyone a copy of this jar file.p  pNow we want to make this software available to other workplaces.  The problem is that the URL, username, and password for the database are hardcoded in the application.  I want to create a setup process for it so that when someone downloads it, they go through a wizard that downloads MySQL and sets up the database wherever they choose.  The person can then distribute the jar file to everyone in their workplace without them having to do the setup, because everyone will be accessing the same database.p  pThis process must save the database URL, username, and password somehow so that the people in the workplace can run the jar from whatever computer.  This makes me think that they should be saved inside the jar... is a Properties file that I need  Can I put a Properties file inside the jar and allow it to be edited during the setup processp  pAny guidance is greatly appreciated, Im very new to thisp  pp  pEDIT I think what Im going to do now is let the user install MySQL and set up their database themself.  As the answers below suggested, having this automatic might be more trouble than its worth, as I would have to deal with everyones different platforms, preferences for setting up the database, security concerns, etc. Once they do this, they will just download my jar file.p  pIve added a properties file to my jar file to store the database URL, username, and password.  This file is initially empty, so when the user runs the jar for the first time, the program will attempt to access the properties file, see that its empty, and prompt the user to enter this information.  It will then extract the properties file from the jar, edit in their information, and stick the properties file back into the jar.  Then, the person should be able to distribute the updated jar to their coworkers and they should all be able to open it without having to supply that information.  Ive got this part almost working.  Im also going to add the ability to reconfigure the program  in case the user moves their database  by calling the same method they would again have to distribute the new version of the program.p  pNext I want to try securing the properties file somehow by encrypting it or obfuscating the code although I think that only works for class files and not text files....  My concern is that anyone in the workplace can unjar it and open the properties file, then use the URL, username, and password to access the database on their own and cause damage.  Ideally, no one would be able to unjar it at all except for the program itself.p  pIf anyone has other concerns about my method, please let me knowp
Negative 5187 pI have an install.bat file and a resource folder. so long as these two files are in the same directory, if you run install.bat, it will install a my lwjgl game. so what im trying to do is make a self extracting file that when completed runs the launch.bat file. I have tried using iexpress, and got it working for the most part. i have added in all my files and such so it will extract to some directory and then i can run the install.bat file to get my program to work. thing is though, i want the exe i created with iexpress to launch install.bat when its finished. so, i tried using the option in iexpress that says it will execute a command when finished the installation using quotes because its not the actual installation, just extracting the files to some directory specified by the user. when i get to the step where it says what i would like to execute during and after the installation. during the installation i left blank. after the installation i chose the install.bat file. when i try to click next though, it tells me i must choose something for the command during the extraction. I dont have anything specific to do during the installation so i just said echo. without quotes. after i was done i tried running the installer. before it even prompted me for a folder to extract to, it told me that echo. could not be executed. so i went back into my installation via a .sed file and changed the echo. to pause. that didnt work either. i then read on another website that in order to run a file the way i would like to, i put the file name in both the during and after installation boxes. i tried doing that and it didnt work either. can anyone please help mep

Not ideal.p  pI could loop through the rows in the parent table and fire off queries for each of the child tables so I can maintain the hierarchy, though this is EXTREMELY slow.p  pAnother possibility would be to pull all the data into java and build the DTOs by looping through Lists, but Im not a fan of that either.p  pIs there another way to achieve the desired result that wouldnt require so much overheadp  pThe project is using Java, MySQL, and Spring JDBC.p

I would like a URL such as codeindex.htmlproductslistcode to first call a universal view to insert basic page scaffolding into the DOM, and display items like a global logo.  Then to call a products view, which inserts some general product DOM elements.  Then to call a list view, which displays a list of products.p  pIf I do something likep  precodevar router   Backbone.Router.extend       initialize  function          new HeaderViewelheader.render       , codepre  pThen the codeinitializecode routine is only called when the page is first loaded.  If something clears the header, then navigating back to the route doesnt redisplay it because the router already exists, and so codeinitializecode isnt called again.p  pI can obviously set up a route like codeproductslistcode to call a function, but then that function needs to take care of drawing the entire page, which is code that would need repeated inside all routes, and makes the whole thing upside down.p  pIve looked at things like Marionette, but that looks like it could be a sledgehammer to crack a nut.p  pFinally I could abandon Backbone.Router altogether, and have one big global view, which does its own delegation to subviews by parsing the URL, but that cant be correct eitherp  pIs there an easy way to have this hierarchy of views  I imagine its quite common so Im not sure what Ive missedp

Negative 5187 pIm trying to make one of my command line utilities a little more user friendly.  Most of my coworkers dont mind using the utility as a CLI, but navigating to it is a bit of a pain to them.  Id rather not go to every computer and set up a shortcut in their CLI sop  pIs there a way to make a .jar file launch a command line utility into a command prompt preferably PowerShell  I tried searching Google and Stack Overflow but am having a hard time making headway...  Any direction would be much appreciated.p  pI somehow imagine this using codeDesktopcode, but am not sure how that would work.p
Negative 5187 pI suspect that this relates to having managedcode DLL projects in the solution, since in VS2010 the menuitem was also missing unless I manually unloaded all managedcode projects from the solution.p  pIn VS2012 though, I now have many more managed DLLs in the solution not by personal choice, so I am hoping that there might be a way to enable Apply Code Changes even with managed DLLs in the solution.p  pI have set my local debugging mode to Native Only and also edited the Edit and Continue options under Debug  Options and Settings... to enable native Edit and Continue, but still I get no Apply Code Changes icon under the Debug menu.p  pIf I manually add the Apply Code Changes button to a toolbar, it remains continually disabled.p  pPlease can anyone offer any hints and tips as to how I might get this to work, or do I simply have to unload all managedcode projects from the solutionp  pSupposing that I do have to unload the managedcode projects, is there a straightforward way to maintain two different sets of solution options so that I can quickly decide whether I wish to mount all projects or nativeonlyp

Negative 5187 pI am making a tree essentially a prefix tree, but for numbers not strings, which is built from sorted list of tuples of numbers  1,1,2, 1,2,5, 2,1,0 etc..., each one associated with a single scalar value int or double most likely. As it is built only once and then iterated oversearched several times, I plan to use stdvectors to hold the children of each node. To search the tree, I just need to call stdlowerbound to do a binary search on each nodes children vector, which will contain stdpairs of each node and their respective key. However, the bottom nodes must contain a vector with pairs consisting of the last entry in each tuple and their respective values, and thus must be of a different type than the BranchNode. The code looks like this p  precodeclass GenNode    templatelttypename keytype,typename valuetypegt class BranchNode  GenNode      void insertstdpairlt stdvectorltkeytypegt , valuetypegt private     stdvectorlt stdpairltkeytype,GenNodegt gt children   templatelttypename keytype,typename valuetypegt class LeafNode  GenNode  private     stdvectorlt stdpairltkeytype,valuetypegt gt children  codepre  pHowever, this is really ugly, because both classes must inherit from the useless GenNode class so that the children of each BranchNode can be either other BranchNodes or LeafNodes...is there a better way to do thisp
Negative 5187 pThis is my first time here, if I make any mistakes, let me knowp  pSo, I have a treetable some modified version for my needs of aephyr  a hrefhttpcode.google.compaephyr relnofollowhttpcode.google.compaephyra that will eventually have hundreds of thousands of rows  really, since the table is for receiving messages, it could never end. So, I had to manage to keep the information on disk, and only load it when the user wants to see it. I keep at most 100 children in the tables root, and load some nodes up or down, by clicking two special nodes at begining or end of the table. Obviously, this is not user friendly, and anoying if you are in the node 10, and want to scroll to 2000 for instance.p  pTo make it easier to use, I want to have a scrollbar, and the position of it would tell me which nodes I have to load. Problem is, the default scrollbar in my tables JScrollPane appears to have only 100 nodes, no matter what I return for getRowCount. I managed to create another JScrollBar looking like it should, and make it scroll to where I want, but since is not binded to the table nor to the scroll pane, it wont respond to scrolling through the viewport nor to mouse wheel.p  pThan, my question is anyone have an idea on how I could make the original JScrollPanes scrollbar look like what I want, so I dont have to reinvent the wheel in responding to all possible events in table, viewport and scroll barp  pIf needed, I could try to make some sample code, but that will take me some time, something I dont have right now p  pThnaks in advancep  p[EDIT]p  pI created a sample code with my problem... Is not very good, but I think is enough for you understand what my problem is... I have the Aephyr project in Eclipse, and created a new LazyTableTest package into it... The source code for the package is in this zip file a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B4Ti8BMZvD2b2dtY05GWkxFVGsedituspsharingt relnofollowhttpsdocs.google.comfiled0B4Ti8BMZvD2b2dtY05GWkxFVGsedituspsharingtap  pRun the DemoTable  it will create a file with 2000 entries, and display them in a table initialization is somewhat slow for the file creation.... The frame contains two scrollbars   the internal is the default for the table for 100 nodes  the external is mine own. It works as expected some bugs when moving the knob directly. When the action comes from the wheel or viewport, nothing will happen  I did not set anything for that, and, as said before, dont want to reinvent the wheel on this...

Or is there maybe something special going on with the implementation of codeUrlcode in the example given above, that cannot be resolved by specifying a library orderp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTurns out the problem I was seeing had nothing to do with the order in which classes were loaded.

Click on codeForm2code again to give it focus again. Now click in the middle of the text 123456 of the codeTRichEditcode in codeForm1code  the focus will change back to codeForm1code, but the cursor caret wont be in the middle of the text 123456 where you clicked, but on the second empty line of the codeRichEditcode or wherever it was previously.

Negative 5187 pI am a beginner who is trying to learn Ruby. I have learned some of the easier stuff so far, but I seem to be stuck in trying to combine a couple of things Ive learned. p  pWhat I am trying to do is to ask the user a question and tell them to enter either 1 or 2. A simple if statement would let me respond with one option if they enter 1, and another option if they enter 2. However, if they enter something entirely different like a different number, a string, etc., how can I prompt them to try again and have it loop back to the original questionp  pWhat I have so far looks something like this. p  precodeprompt  gt   puts Question asking for 1 or 2.  print prompt userinput  gets.chomp.toi  if userinput  1        puts One response.  elsif userinput  2       puts Second response.  else        puts Please enter a 1 or a 2.  end codepre  pThis is where Im stuck. How do I make it go back to the Question asking for 1 or 2. until the user enters a 1 or 2 I know its probably a loop of some kind, but I cant seem to figure out which kind to use and how to incorporate asking for user input repeatedly if necessary until getting the desired input. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. p

Negative 5187 pSo my friend told me that instances on Heroku are persistent Im not sure if the vocab is right, but he implied that all users share the same instance.p  pSo, if I have codeapp.pycode, and an instance runs it, then all users share that instance. That means we can use a dict as a temporary cache for storing small things for faster response time.p  pSo for example, if Im serving an API, I can maybe define a cache like a hrefhttpsgithub.comkaranHNifyblobmasterapp.pyL11L28 relnofollowthisa and then a hrefhttpsgithub.comkaranHNifyblobmasterapp.pyL60L67 relnofollowuse ita.p  pHow true is that I tried looking this up, but could not find anything.p  pI deployed the linked API to heroku on 1 dyno, and with just a few requests per second, it was taking over 100 seconds to serve it. So my understanding is that the cache wasnt working. It might be useful to note here that majority of time was due to a hrefhttpsdevcenter.heroku.comarticleshttproutingrequestqueueing relnofollowrequest queueinga, according to new relic.p

My apps minSdkVersion is set to 11 and only operates in the landscape orientation.p  pThe problem is I keep getting a OOM error after leaving my app run for a while.

OOM error. p  pIm using hardware acceleration by declaring androidhardwareAcceleratedtrue in my manifest and using setLayerType View.LAYERTYPEHARDWARE , null  in my SurfaceView constructor to set it to be hardware accelerated.p  pUsing setLayerType View.LAYERTYPEHARDWARE , null  was my problem, I removed it and the memory leak stopped.p  pWeird thing is once I press the home button then go back to my app the native heap resets back to its initial value.p  pMy proof the dalvik heap is remaining constant and the native heap is growing is from these messages in LogCatp  pdebug.native heap

Negative 5187 pI was reading that it was a good idea to convert all GET type requests to a json resource to POST in order to prevent another site from stealing information through codeltscript srcmyEndpointgtcode but Im still trying to make sense of it. It seems that this would would only protect against that scenario or possible enumeration of the endpoint. p  pI am planning for our json resources to require an auth token in the auth header in order for the action to execute and return JSON. Should this be good enoughp

Negative 5187 pSo my professor assigned this project for us. Its pretty simple because its our first hashing program. The program is to take 15 names as input and hash them and store them in something. I did it in a vector. Now once they are hashed the user enters another name and it will should hash that name and try to match it to one in the vector. Maybe it is me or maybe it is how he wrote the question but Im a little confused. Our program is suppose to have collision protection. Which means we run an algorithm on the name inputted and it will spit out a number and that number is where we store the name in the vector. If there is another name already in that spot we are suppose to store it in the next available spot.p  pSo lets say I enter the name jordan and jon. The algorithm will tell me to store these in the same spot lets say spot 8 but collision protection will recognize that jordan is already taking up the spot 8 and it will move jon to the next available spotlets say spot 9. Now when the user is entering names to see if it is in the vector already and he enters jon, the algorithm will see it should be in spot 8. Do you think I should just check to see if that spot is empty, if not say a match has been found in spot 8, even though the name in spot 8 is jordan and the name entered is jon. Or should I start at spot 8 and see if the strings match, and if they dont check the next spot and so on until i return to the original spot or find the matchp  pI wrote the program and it works fine, I just ran into this one dilemma and cant finish the program.  Thanksp

Negative 5187 pTwo questions about these threep  ol lipHow can you load only a PART of an image in a texture GLuint using SOIL. I can load a full PNG picture but I cant figure out how to load only a PART of it. As in animations. for example a hrefhttpwww.luxinia.deuploadsTutorialsexplosprite.png relnofollowHEREa which is an animation of a shooting catapult. How do I load only a part of it  With known location of pixels needed for that part.pli lipHow to do Pixelperpixel collision detection using codeglReadPixelscode I succeeded using the function to read pixels off the screen but Im not sure when to use it. First I thought about when loading a texture, analyze its limits the pixels that might collide and not all the pixels into a certain pattern and then when a grid of a certain PNG crosses another  analyze if the pixels of both textures in the certain X and Y are meant to be touching each other and colliding. Im not sure how to do that using glReadPixels or any other function to read pixels off of the PNG texture which ISNT on screen yet. Any idea to make Pixelperpixel 2D collision  OR a better 2D collision detection algorithm pli ol
Negative 5187 pI have a JavaFX program where the user can load a XML file. This file is then being parsed using codejavax.xml.parser.DocumentBuildercode on a worker thread that extends codejavafx.concurrent.Taskcode.p  pLoading and parsing the xml files works just fine. The problem is that with some files the loading takes much longer than with others and I cant figure out what causes the loading process to take longer.p  pI measured the duration of the loading task for two different example files. File codeAcode has a size of around 80MB, the size of File codeBcode is approximately 50MB. Loading File codeAcode takes around 5s on average, while its around 20s for File codeBcode. Both files have 1,000,000 nodes with 60 being white space text nodes. Also the file tree structure of both files is similar and processing the parsed codeorg.w3c.dom.Documentcode in further steps takes approximately an equal amount of time.p  pAnother observation I made is, that when Im loading File codeAcode the GUI has some serious lags, whereas its running smoothly when loading File codeBcode. Because of this I concluded that the Thread loading File codeAcode has  in some mystic way  a higher priority than the Thread loading File codeBcode.p  pHeres the code snippet used for loadingp  precodeFile file  fileChooser.showOpenDialogstage Document doc  private class ReadXmlTask extends TaskltVoidgt      Override     protected Void call          try              DocumentBuilderFactory dbf  DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance             DocumentBuilder db  dbf.newDocumentBuilder             doc  db.parsefile          catch ...          return null        Thread thread  new Threadnew ReadXmlTask thread.setDaemontrue thread.start codepre  pIt doesnt matter whether codesetDaemoncode is set to codefalsecodeor codetruecode.p  pSo my question is Where does the different running time come from And is there any way to set some sort of priority for a worker thread in comparison to the JavaFX Application Threadp

Negative 5187 pIve made a directive for a special type of submit button that watches when its form is submitted, and then that buttons is disabled and gets a nice animated progress bar.p  pThis all works fine when the form is submitted by pressing the submit button or pressing enter in one of the fields, the onsubmit handler is called just fine.p  pThe problem in one of my forms I have a textarea which I want to submit when the user presses the enter key. So I made an onEnter directive that just looks for the right key press and then executes a function.p  precodeltform nameform ngsubmitcontroller.submitgt     lttextarea ngmodelcontroller.newMessage.content autofocus onentercontroller.submit     ltprogressbutton typesubmitgtPostltprogressbuttongt ltformgt codepre  pThe problem of course is that this doesnt trigger the onsubmit handler, and thus the button isnt disabled or anything. How could I solve this Ive tried something like codedocument.form.submitcode, but that submits the form in the old fashioned HTML way, of course bypassing all Angular  JS code and handlers. Should I find the submit button and simulate a click That feels very hackish too.p  pSadly codescope.formcode is very useless, nothing there to submit it.p  pEdit 1 Just so the problem is clear yes, the controller.submit function is called just fine via the onenter directive. However, strongthe form doesnt get a submit event which my button is listening forstrong.p  pEdit 2 Here is a gist with my button directive a hrefhttpsgist.github.comkevinrenskersd66dbebe43c8533efaf2httpsgist.github.comkevinrenskersd66dbebe43c8533efaf2a. The button currently needs a pbclick attribute, or its form needs a pbsubmit attribute. Those functions need to return a promise. p  pMoving this logic to a scope variable thats set from these functions might not be a big deal since that means we can use standard ngclick and ngsubmit, dont need to return promises, etc. On the other hand, if you have 5 buttons on one page you then need to create 5 scope variables. Not the best idea either. Or keep using pbclick and for forms use a scope variablep
Negative 5187 pThis is a followup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23807958mpimessagereceivedindifferentcommunicatorthis previous question of minea, for which the conclusion was that the program was erroneous, and therefore the expected behavior was undefined.p  pWhat Im trying to create here is a simple errorhandling mechanism, for which I use that Irecv request for the empty message as an emabort handleem, attaching it to my normal codeMPIWaitcode call and turning it into codeMPIWaitAnycode, in order to allow me to unblock process 1 in case an error occurs on process 0 and it can no longer reach the point where its supposed to post the matching codeMPIRecvcode.p  pWhats happening is that, due to internal message buffering, the codeMPIIsendcode may succeed right away, without the other process being able to post the matching codeMPIRecvcode. So theres no way of canceling it anymore.p  pI was hoping that once all processes call codeMPICommfreecode I can just forget about that message once and for all, but, as it turns out, thats not the case. Instead, its being delivered to the codeMPIRecvcode in the following communicator.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs this also an erroneous program, or is it a bug in the MPI implementation Intel MPI 4.0.3li liIf I turn my codeMPIIsendcode calls into codeMPIIssendcode, the program works as expected  can I at least in that case rest assured that the program is correctli liAm I reinventing the wheel here Is there a simpler way to achieve thisli ol  pAgain, any feedback is much appreciatedp  hr  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude stdio.h include unistd.h include mpi.h include time.h include stdlib.h  int mainint argc, char argv[]      int rank, size     MPIGroup group     MPIComm mycomm      srandtimeNULL     MPIInitampargc, ampargv      MPICommrankMPICOMMWORLD, amprank     MPICommsizeMPICOMMWORLD, ampsize     MPICommgroupMPICOMMWORLD, ampgroup      MPICommcreateMPICOMMWORLD, group, ampmycomm     if rank  0 printfcreated communicator dn, mycomm      if rank  1          MPIRequest req[2]         int msg  123, which          MPIIsendampmsg, 1, MPIINT, 0, 0, mycomm, ampreq[0]         MPIIrecvNULL, 0, MPIINT, 0, 0, mycomm, ampreq[1]          MPIWaitany2, req, ampwhich, MPISTATUSIGNORE          MPIBarriermycomm          if which  0              printfrank 1 send succeed cancelling abort handlen             MPICancelampreq[1]             MPIWaitampreq[1], MPISTATUSIGNORE          else              printfrank 1 send aborted cancelling send requestn             MPICancelampreq[0]             MPIWaitampreq[0], MPISTATUSIGNORE               else          MPIRequest req         int msg, r  rand  2         if r              printfrank 0 receiving messagen             MPIRecvampmsg, 1, MPIINT, 1, 0, mycomm, MPISTATUSIGNORE          else              printfrank 0 sending abort messagen             MPIIsendNULL, 0, MPIINT, 1, 0, mycomm, ampreq                   MPIBarriermycomm          if r              MPICancelampreq             MPIWaitampreq, MPISTATUSIGNORE                    if rank  0 printffreeing communicator dn, mycomm     MPICommfreeampmycomm      sleep2      MPICommcreateMPICOMMWORLD, group, ampmycomm     if rank  0 printfcreated communicator dn, mycomm      if rank  0          MPIRequest req         MPIStatus status         int msg, cancelled          MPIIrecvampmsg, 1, MPIINT, 1, 0, mycomm, ampreq         sleep1          MPICancelampreq         MPIWaitampreq, ampstatus         MPITestcancelledampstatus, ampcancelled          if cancelled              printfrank 0 receive cancelledn          else              printfrank 0 OLD MESSAGE RECEIVEDn                    if rank  0 printffreeing communicator dn, mycomm     MPICommfreeampmycomm      MPIFinalize     return 0  codepre  poutputsp  precodecreated communicator 2080374784 rank 0 sending abort message rank 1 send succeed cancelling abort handle freeing communicator 2080374784 created communicator 2080374784 rank 0 STRAY MESSAGE RECEIVED freeing communicator 2080374784 codepre

Negative 5187 pI am using a small standard Azure Website instance with autoscale turned on.p  pMy Asp.net application has to initialise warm up, compile some objects which take a little time, can be around 4 mins. I decided to do it up front rather than when a user hits the relevant code. However this setup seems to knock the Web instance offline with a 503 error, which is really surprising to me, since I thought Azure was very resilient. It is fine if it takes longer, and is subject to a bit of throttling, which one would only expected on Shared instances. Anyway 503 should not happen.p  pAny thoughts on how I can prevent this happening, except write more efficient code, which I am trying to do, but it cannot happen short term, so hoping for a Azure centric solution. In any case I am totally surprised that Azure Website Standard instance seem to throw 503s too easily, and become unavailable.p  pWhen I retry, after leaving for about 4 min, the site becomes available again, but my startup code will then return it to a 503 situation. When the startup code is implemented through the application when needed there is no issue apart from delaying the user. So code itself is not causing a problem, apart from running for a little while.p  pThanks in advance,p  pEDIT I think there is a 2 min limit in Azure Websites, which I may be exceedingp
Negative 5187 pI would like to bind a number to an input box and make sure that it is never displayed in scientific notation.p  precodeltinput typetext classformcontrol textright         databindvalue myData, valueUpdate afterkeydown gt codepre  pThe input box should accept a decimal number of up to 8 places and I should be able to modify codemyDatacode from my viewModel and have it shown as a number such as code.00000001code.  Id like codemyDatacode to be a number because I perform arithmetic on it within the viewModel.  p  pThe example a hrefhttpknockoutjs.comdocumentationextenders.html relnofollownumeric extendera doesnt work for me because if you start trying to type code.00001code, it starts to update the value from underneath the user.  Ive tried using ratelimiting, but that setting is finicky as it eventually changes the value from under the user as well.   p  pIs there a way to code an extender such that the display binding to the input box is always codetoFixed8code while some underlying data is always numeric   The opposite would be okay where the underlying data is text but can be accessed somehow as numeric when needed.p  pThank youp

Negative 5187 pI am reading from a file with several thousand floats written in plain text in it, in sections that are separated by newlines.  The floats themselves are separated by whitespace, and occasionally a semicolon to separate every group of 3.  A newline character doesnt appear until at the very end, an unknown but probably tens of thousands of characters later.p  pThe language Im using is Cp  precode3Dmodel.txt   Obj1 Vertice count5842  0.499507 0.003674 0.699311 0.454010 0.075165 ... 0.022236 n newline  codepre  pMy question is, what is the best way to extract the strings from the file and into memory  p  pI cannot use codefgetscode it seems, because the newline is so far out, and because it may end reading in the middle of a float, leaving it incomplete.  Reading the entire file into memory seems needlessly expensive, though it wouldnt be terrible if it were the only way, as each file is only 2MB to 10MB large.  p

Negative 5187 pI have a countdown timer that when you start it, it creates a notification and sets it to fire for the time that the countdown timer is set for. I also start a 1 second timer to update the label when it goes down. Once I receive the local notification, if the app is open I hit the didReceiveLocalNotificationUILocalNotification notification function and if Im not in the app the local notification pops up. Everything works fine if I stay in the app or just close it and that is it. The problems occur when I try to multitask with multiple apps.p  pI have noticed the following and I am not sure how to fix itp  ol liIf I start the timer, then close the app by hitting the home button once then open another app and do some stuff and then open my app back up, the timer label does not remember the time it left off at. I tried saving the end NSDate in the viewdiddisappear method but Im not sure when to resume it as if I switch tabs while the app is still open, it will get saved and I wont know how to update.li liIf you start the time and then double tap home and force close the app, no code is called so I was unable to save the time. How would I be able to resume thenli ol  pAny idea how to fix thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 5187 pI have a super pom that contains many sub module poms.  The super pom build takes around 5 min.  Currently, I just rebuild the top level every time I want to test my changes even though the changes maybe all within one or just a few of the sub modules and seldom ever span more than 20 of all the poms.  So doing the full build is time consuming and inefficient.p  pIs there a way like a Maven plugin or built in already for Maven to detect in which poms the changes are and rebuild only those poms, saving me a lot of time  I was thinking that could be accomplished by comparing the time stamps of all the source files that are getting built with those of the jars they go into and detect the changes defined as those source files that have the time stamp greater than their jar.  Then just build those poms following the build sequence based on the dependencies. p

Negative 5187 pI could begin by asking the question outright or by citing my sources a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comboldnewthingarchive2011102810230811.aspx relnofollowthisa, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms969905.aspx relnofollowthisa, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comboldnewthingarchive2014030510505179.aspx relnofollowthisa, and a hrefhttpwww.catch22.nettutsflickerfreedrawing relnofollowthisa descriptively, but Ill walk you ll through what Im trying to do instead.p  pLets start with a main window. It has its own window class whose codehbrBackgroundcode is set to codeCOLORBTNFACE  1code. Now lets dop  precodeEnableThemeDialogTexturehwnd, ETDTENABLE  ETDTUSETABTEXTURE codepre  pso the tab control were about to add will be drawn with visual styles. Try Windows XP with the standard Luna theme for best results. Now lets add a tab control and two tabs.p  pOn the first tab, we create an instance lets call it codecontainercode of a new window class. This window class is going to hold various controls. I could set codehbrBackgroundcode to codeCOLORBTNFACE  1code, but then it will draw over the tab background. So I want this new child window to be transparent. So what I do isp  ol liset the class codehbrBackgroundcode to codeGetStockObjectHOLLOWBRUSHcodeli liset codecontainercodes extended style to codeWSEXTRANSPARENTcodeli liset the class codeWMERASEBKGNDcode handler to do codeSetBkModeHDC wParam, TRANSPARENT return 0code to set the device context and have Windows draw the transparent background.li ol  pSo far so good, right Im not sure if Im really doing all this correctly, and Id like this to also be flickerfree, which doesnt seem to happen when I resize the window at least in wine I get either flicker or garbage drawn even in child controls, somehow. Windows XP in a VM just shows flicker. I tried tweaking some settings but to no avail.p  pBut wait, now I want to have another control, one that just draws some bitmap data. On the next tab, create another codecontainercode, then have a third window class codeareacode as a child of emthatem. codeareacode only draws in the upperleft 100x100 area and has scrollbars the rest of the window area should be transparent.p  pRight now, what I have for codeareacode isp  ol lithe window class codehbrBackgroundcode set to codeNULLcode and styles codeCSHREDRAWcode and codeCSVREDRAWcode setli lithe extended window style being code0codeli lithe codeWMERASEBKGNDcode simply doing codereturn 1codeli lithe codeWMPAINTcode filling the strongentirestrong update rect with codeCOLORBTNFACE  1code before drawing, and rendering all of itli ol  pThis is flickerfree, but obviously not transparent. NOW Im really not sure what to do, because I want the codeareacode to be transparent in such a way that it shows the tab control background. Again, I tried tweaking settings to bring them closer to what I tried above with codecontainercode, but I got either flicker or invalidation leftovers when I tried.p  pSo how do I get both of these custom control types the container and the drawing area to be both flickerfree and transparentp  pI presently must target Windows XP at a minimum, though if the solution would be easier with Vista only Id be happy to keep that solution on the side in case I ever drop XP support unfortunately Stack Overflow doesnt let me hand out silver medals....p  pThanksp

Negative 5187 pI have a dataset which i read in to python as tuples, it looks something like the below one,p  precodename time  dept  id   b1  200pm z1   1  b2  300pm z2   2  c1  400pm y2   1  b3  300pm z3   3  c4  400pm x2   2 codepre  pI am trying to partition my data in to chunks based on the id value. It should be one chunk having all the tuples with value 1 in id column, another chunk with value 2, and so on. What i am thinking is to create a dictionary with id as my key, i could create a dictionary, but the glitch here is to remove id column from my value in dictionary. p  pSince tuples are immutable, i am not able to remove the id column value, meanwhile i need that column value to keep it as a key in my dictionary. And I am looking for an optimized version, because my code has to handle millions of tuples. please suggest.p

Negative 5187 pLets say I want to define two classes classes, codeSentencecode and codeWordcode. Each word object has a character string and a part of speech pos. Each sentence contains some number of words and has an additional slot for data.p  pThe codeWordcode class is straightforward to define.p  precodewordSlots lt listword  character, pos  character wordProto lt listword  , pos   setClassWord, slots  wordSlots, prototype  wordProto     Word lt functionword, pos newWord, wordword, pospos codepre  pNow I want to make a codeSentencecode class which can contain some codeWordcodes and some numerical data.p  pIf I define the codeSentencecode class as sop  precodesentenceSlots lt listwords  Word, stats  numeric sentenceProto lt listwords  Word, stats  0 setClassSentence, slots  sentenceSlots, prototype  sentenceProto codepre  pThen the sentence can contain only one word. I could obviously define it with many slots, one for each word, but then it will be limited in length.p  pHowever, if I define the codeSentencecode class like thisp  precodesentenceSlots lt listwords  list, stats  numeric sentenceProto lt listwords  listWord, stats  0 setClassSentence, slots  sentenceSlots, prototype  sentenceProto codepre  pit can contain as many words as I want, but the slot codewordscode can contain objects which are not of the class codeWordcode.p  pIs there a way to accomplish this This would be similar to the C thing where you can have a vector of objects of the same type.p

Negative 5187 pI have a table that logs invalid user login attempts. Every time an invalid attempt is made, the username, user IP, user email and timedate is stored in the database.p  pWhat Id like to do is check if within ANY 24 hour time period there has been more than X invalid attempts by the same user. However, the users can change the email, username or IP at any point. So, I need to check that anyone of these 3 fields is in common.p  pFor examplep  ul liUser ID 1 IP 1.1.1.1 Email testtest.com li liUser ID 2 IP 1.1.1.1 Email test2test.com li liUser ID 1 IP 1.1.1.2 Email test3test.comli liUser ID 4 IP 1.1.1.4 Email testtest.comli liUser ID 5 IP 1.1.1.4 Email test5test.comli ul  pAll of these would match as the SAME user because they share EITHER the user ID, the IP or the email. Then I need to output all user IDs, IPs and emails so I can ban any user in another table that matches these criteria. p

Negative 5187 pSuppose I wanted to make my own reference smart pointer type which is guaranteed to always refer to emimmutableem data, rather than merely immutablyviewed data. In other words, data which cant be mutated by emanyoneem, as opposed to just not through that particular reference. This is not so easy, because C generally considers codeconstcode things to be a subcase of mutableaccess things, and codeampcode references implicitly convert to codeconst ampcode, likewise codecode to codeconst code.p  pLets call this typep  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class ImmRef  ...  codepre  pOne straightforward thing I can do is to declarep  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt struct Imm      const T value  codepre  pand then only allow creating codeImmRefcodes out of codeImmcodes, or other codeImmRefcodes. Here the variable itself is declared codeconstcode, so its not possible to make any mutable references to it, and it is in fact truly immutable. Unless it internally uses codemutablecode, but since theres nothing we can do about that, lets ignore it.p  pThat works, but for greater flexibility, wider applicability, and compatibility with other code which doesnt know about our codeImmcode type, it would be much better if we could create codeImmRefcodes to emanyem codeconstcodedeclared variable. But its not clear whether C makes it possible to distinguish a variable that is declared codeconstcode from a codeconstcode reference to a variable, or even from a variable that is not declared codeconstcode.p  pIn other words, this should workp  precodeconst int myConstNumber  666 ImmRefltintgt myImmRef  immRefmyConstNumber codepre  pBut this should notp  precodeint myNumber  666 ImmRefltintgt myImmRef  immRefmyNumber codepre  pAnd this should notp  precodeconst intamp myConstRef  myNumber ImmRefltintgt myImmRef  immRefmyConstRef codepre  pIs there any dark template magic which lets me do thisp

Negative 5187 pIm developing a native iOS app and have a backend PHP server communicated with HTTPS.p  pWhat I have now is that I can login with usernamepassword login, facebook or google login.

I have a TextView within a toolbar and setting the text based on the page.  I am using the TextView rather than the toolbar title because I believe it would be easier to implement an animation.

If I import the existing static lib VS project into my DLL solution and create a reference to it via the projects Common Properties  References, the DLL compiles, links and executes fine also as debug build. This seems odd to me, as since Im using the same project in a different solution, it will be compiling the same and thus I should have the same undefined symbols. p  pObviously VS is doing something different in linking them when in same solution versus exporting the lib and then linking against it. Does anyone know why I would be getting this kind of behaviour and what I could do try and resolve itp

Negative 5187 pMy skill level basic user of VBA, know next to nothing about SQL though Ive recently learned how to execute code, etc.p  pIve created a user interface in an Excel worksheet to allow user input of report variables dates, etc.  These pass into a second Excel worksheet that, through the use of various Excel statements, creates the necessary SQL code. My macro then copies this worksheet and opens Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Rx via a shell command.  Currently, I then manually click connect on the resultant Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 connecttoserver window which does not need a password, just requires me to click connect, I create a new query, I paste the code in and then execute in SQL.  So it is these latter steps opening SQL, click connect, copypaste code, execute that Im trying to automate via VBA.p  pTo offer more context, once the SQL code has run, I then have a second macro that uses the Excel Data Connection wizard to bring the resultant SQL data back into my worksheet.  This is working well.p  pIve researched this for several days on various boards.  None seem to observe my approach of creating the code in Excel probably because it is an inelegant approach.  Or the post responses are beyond my skill level to understand.  But I do fear that Im asking a question that has been answered before apologies in advance.p  pThanks for whatever advicetime can be offered.p  pIm using ExcelOffice 2010 Microsoft SQL Server2008 R2 is this the same as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studios My SQL application shows both names Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 6.1 Library this is NOT currently checked off.

Negative 5187 pSimilar questions about getting logs on YARN have been asked before, but I cannot seem to make this work the way I want on Amazon EMR in particular.p  pI have Spark jobs running on EMR, triggered via the Java AWS client. On earlier versions of Spark I used to run them directly on EMR, but with the later versions I switched to using YARN as the resource manager which should give some performance and cost benefits, as well as fit well with the EMR documentation.p  pThe problem is of course the logs from my jobs disappear into YARN rather than being collected in the EMR console. In a perfect world, I want to pull these into the stdout or stderr files in the EMR web console step execution logs currently stdout is empty and stderr contains just YARN noise.p  pThe Amazon forums and the AWS EMR documentation on this page would seem to suggest that the correct way is to just supplying a log URI like Im already doing and everything will work it doesnt. a hrefhttpsdocs.aws.amazon.comElasticMapReducelatestDeveloperGuideemrplandebugging.html relnofollowhttpsdocs.aws.amazon.comElasticMapReducelatestDeveloperGuideemrplandebugging.htmlap  pI have also tried configuring YARN with the solution here a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions26476728yarnlogaggregationonawsemrunsupportedfilesystemexceptionYARN log aggregation on AWS EMR  UnsupportedFileSystemExceptionap  pI added a configure hadoop bootstrap action that will configure yarn.

Negative 5187 pIve implemented a codeBitmapSpiceManagercode and codeBitmapRequestcode in my app to download an image or fetch from the cache if already downloaded. The problem is following the examples given by RoboSpice, the caching only works within one codeActivitycode. If you end that activity by going back to a previous one for example and then launch it again, the cache does not contain what was loaded in it before its cleared.p  pIm following the pattern where you have a base activity that holds a codeBitmapSpiceManagercode and from my subclass activity I make a request using the manager. This gets the file and caches it, I proved it comes from the cache again within the activity by hooking up a button which removes the ImageView then trys to load the image again.p  pIs it possible to have the images cached in one Activity available in another I need like an application wide SpiceManager. Ideally the cached items could persist beyond application runs too i.e. cache for a few hours. Is there a better way to structure the RoboSpice code in applications than the examplesp  pIf I subclass codeBitmapSpiceServicecode and override the codecreateCacheManagercode method is that going to help I could use codeDiskLruCachecode but the codeBitmapSpiceServicecode uses codeInFileBitmapObjectPersistercode which says it writes files out, so I figure its the same. Im not sure why the cache is cleared when the Activity dies.p

Negative 5187 pI have a crucial question related to sending SMS trough SMPP or SS7.p  pCase We are connected to all local operators using SMPPwe already have an agreement with each one. The fact is that we are able to send SMS to all local operators and actually receive the DLRdeliversm, but there a lot of cases when we are not receiving anything back.p  pBy the other hand, we have an E1 connection running SS7 with one local operator for voice purposes. I was thinking if it is possible to SEND SMS using this SS7 E1 connection There is couple of hardware in the market that provide this functionality. p  pMy principal concerns are  What should I check before buying this SS7 SMS hardware, to be sure that this will work in our SS7 E1 connection  Can the operator blocks the SMS that are comming from the E1 SS7 connection  If we actually send a SMS usign the SS7 E1 connection, where will be receive the DLR, in the SMPP connection, or in the E1 SS7  Will be able to have dynamic sender id if we send SMS trough the SS7 E1p  pThanks and best regards,p  pClaudiop

Negative 5187 pAs per my understanding when the kernel finds out that the current running process should be striped of the CPU, it enables the needresched flag. The flag is then checked before returning to user space, and if the flag enabled the kernel initiates call for schedule. However I have noticed that within sysschedyield routine we dont use the needresched flag but explicitly call the schedule routine. Why p

Negative 5187 pi have 130 bit data vector blocks where 2 bits are header bits and 128 bits are data bits ,header bits can be anywhere in the 130 bit vector, i have to process 128  bits which come after the header bits ,if header is detected somewhere middle in the 130 bit vector, suppose at 60th position then i have to process 60 bits of current vector block and 68 bits of next vector block . i was trying to fix the initial offset after which header comes in the data vector but for that there will be 128 cases for worst case scenario where header comes at the end of data vector,i want to ask is there any other better approach than using cases  p

Negative 5187 pSo lets say, that I have a class testa, b, c and I want pythonv3 to create random objects that use this class.

So something in this direction not a real codep  precodeaNone bNone cNone list[a, b, c] for i in list     itestsomething random, something random, something random codepre  pthe problem with this solution is that in this way I can only have lenlist of those random objects and I have to create them myself upfront. Is there a way for pythonv3 to create an object all by himself, so that I can potentially create an infinite number of  those random objects p  pSide note I tried to find it out by myself but, since I just shortly started to teach myself programming, it might very well be that I could not find an answer because I dont know how to formulate it correctly or maybe even saw it but not recognized it as a solution.p  pThanks upfront for every bit of help and sorry if my English is not perfect p

Negative 5187 pIm a bit confused about how pointers work in Rust. Theres coderefcode, codeBoxcode, codeampcode, codecode, and Im not sure how they work together.p  pHeres how I understand it currentlyp  ol licodeBoxcode isnt really a pointer  its a way to allocate data on the heap, and pass around unsized types traits especially in function arguments.li lipcoderefcode is used in pattern matching to borrow something that you match on, instead of taking it. For example,p  precodelet thing Optionlti32gt  Some4 match thing      None gt printlnnone,     Someref x gt println, x,  x is a borrowed thing  println, x  1  wouldnt work without the ref since the block would have taken ownership of the data codepreli lipcodeampcode is used to make a borrow borrowed pointer. If I have a function codefn fooampselfcode then Im taking a reference to myself that will expire after the function terminates, leaving the callers data alone. I can also pass data that I want to retain ownership of by doing codebarampmydatacode.pli licodecode is used to make a raw pointer for example, codelet y i32  4 let x  ampy as const i32code. I understand pointers in CC but Im not sure how this works with Rusts type system, and how they can be safely used. Im also not sure what the use cases are for this type of pointer.

Negative 5187 pIm trying to addremove dropdown options with Javascript. Currently everything works fine except when you select the option you want to delete from the dropdown. Click the delete button deletes the html, but not the sql entry.p  pEDIT I edited this to what works for me now, maybe save someone else time. CodeGodies answer was ultimately correct, but I had to simplify the php and some issues with my config file were messing me up. This simply gives you a text input to add select options and a button to delete selected options. Still needs to be cleaned up and obviously the idea is for an authenticated admin to have this ability, not the free world.

In the current implementation, it should according to my understanding always throw a codeConstraintViolationExceptioncode because codeisValidcode always returns false, but this is not the case.p  pI have checked that the annotation is being attached to the method argument by calling in another part of the application something along the lines ofp  precodeMethod method  user.getClass.getMethodsetPassword, new Class[]  String.class  Annotation[][] parameterAnnotations  method.getParameterAnnotations System.out.printlnmethod.getName     parameterAnnotations[0][0] codepre  pwhich produces the following outputp  precodesetPasswordutils.Passwordmessageerror.invalid.password, payload[], groups[] codepre  pSo this tells me the annotation is being applied to the method argument. But I cant understand why Im not getting the codeConstraintViolationExceptioncode when I actually call the method. I also never see the output emin initializeem or emin isValidem that I added to these methods as a check to see if theyre being fired.p  pAs another test, I also added the codePasswordcode annotation to the member variable codepasswordcode in codeUser.classcode. This causes the codeConstraintViolationExceptioncode to be thrown as expected, e.g. when I try to persist a codeUsercode object.p  pCan anyone shed light as to why the annotation on the method argument is not working properly Thanks in advancep

Negative 5187 pI am trying to establish Kiwi for testing my iOS project.p  pMy current setup  OS X 10.11 beta  Xcode 7 with iOS 9p  pI have downloaded Kiwi with Carthage and correctly added the framework to the test target. p  pCartfile p  precodegithub kiwibddKiwi codepre  pI have a very simple test that looks like this p  precodeSPECBEGINTest  describeDownload,       contextDownload test request ,           itcheck values are returned,               block NSArray entries  nil              [[Service sharedManager] getDataNSDictionary data, NSError error                   entries  [data allValues]              ]              [[theValueentries shouldEventually] haveCountOf5]                    SPECEND codepre  pService is making a request and executing the provided block when request completes. p  pNow when I run this test for the first time I can observe the required behaviour  the test is being run and if I put a breakpoint it gets hit, or if I put a NSLog statement it gets executed. However, when I make a subsequent run of the test, neither the breakpoint nor the NSLog gets hit on and the test simply passes without actually calling the codegetDatacode method. Sometimes the test gets executed properly but mostly it just says Test succeeded and thats it. Why does this happen  Is there a bug with Kiwi  Is there something else that I might have missed p  pI have the most basic setup possible  just a template Xcode iOS project and the Kiwi framework added manuallyframework created with Carthage. p  pAny help is appreciated p
