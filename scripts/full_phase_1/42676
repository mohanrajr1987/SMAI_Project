Positive 42676 pIm making CORS requests between my web application and a server. The request is a simple authorization request. The request is sent, the server sets a JSESSIONID cookie, a dialogue box pops up, you type your username and password and then press submit. The httpRequest then completes once the credentials are correct, and the response header sets a LWSSOCOOKIEKEY cookie for the client to use for access.p  pThe problem is that this is working flawlessly in internet explorer, and not in chrome or firefox.p  pHeres my request code p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecode code snippet from  httpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialscors  Create the XHR object. function createCORSRequestmethod, url      console.logcreateCORSRequest      var xhr  new XMLHttpRequest     if withCredentials in xhr         XHR for ChromeFirefoxOperaSafari.       xhr.openmethod, url, true       xhr.withCredentials  true         else if typeof XDomainRequest  undefined         XDomainRequest for IE.       xhr  new XDomainRequest       xhr.openmethod, url, false      else         CORS not supported.       xhr  null          return xhr    Make the actual CORS request. function makeCorsRequestaction,URL      console.logmakeCorsRequest action action URL URL     var xhr  createCORSRequestaction, URL     if xhr          console.logCORS not supported         return           Response handlers.     xhr.onload  function          var text  xhr.responseText         console.logResponse text from CORS request to   URL     text           xhr.onerror  function          console.logWoops, there was an error making the request.           xhr.send     return xhr codepre div div p  pIssue with firefox is this error CrossOrigin Request Blocked The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at a hrefhttpsomeIPsomePortqcbinauthenticationpointauthenticate relnofollowhttpsomeIPsomePortqcbinauthenticationpointauthenticatea.

Positive 42676 pI am new to JMeter and we are using it to develop a test plan for our NodeExpress server. I added two HTTP requests one to add a user, and one to delete that user. The first request add user goes through fine, but the second request is failing. The reason it is failing appears to be that JMeter is setting two ContentLength headers onto the request  one is correct and the other is not. The server logs show this errorp  precode [Error request size did not match content length] type request.size.invalid, message request size did not match content length, statusCode 400, status 400, received 2, expected 1299, length 1299  codepre  pIn the View Results Tree, I see that the second request has the following headersp  precodeRequest Headers Connection keepalive ContentType applicationjson ContentType applicationjson charsetutf8 Date Wed, 30 Sep 2015 185017 GMT Vary AcceptEncoding XPoweredBy Express ContentLength 1299 Connection ContentLength 2 UserAgent ApacheHttpClient4.2.6 java 1.5 codepre  pAs you can see, JMeter is setting two codeContentLengthcode headers and I cannot figure out why it should be code2code  not sure where the code1299code is coming from. Also I just noticed its setting two codeContentTypecode headers as well, not sure if that is related.p  pI have googled this issue and cannot seem to find any answers.

Positive 42676 pI started implementing a sample server in netty to support 100 continue.

The           origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending           the 100 Continue response.

Positive 42676 pSo we have this hot discussion going on in the company about whether to put custom error codes in HTTP Header or in body. We Googled a lot but we couldnt come up with a definitive answer yet.p  pHeres the situationp  pstrongTeam Astrong Use HTTP error codes such as 401, 403 and 404 when an application error occurs and have the custom error codes and description in the body. Examples of APIs doing this Stripe and Twitterp  pstrongTeam Bstrong If a REAL HTTP errors occur, let the HTTP header be 401, 404 or whatever. Other than that, use HTTP 200 all the time, and if there are any application errors put it ONLY in the body. In other words, dont use HTTP Headers for application custom errors.

However, I am now wondering which is the better approach to handling relationships between Domain objectsp  ol liCall the necessary find method from the related data mapper directly within the domain objectli liWrite the relationship logic into the native data mapper which is what the examples tend to do in PoEAA and then call the native data mapper function within the domain object.li ol  pEither it seems to me that in order to preserve the Fat Model, Skinny Controller mantra, the domain objects have to be aware of the data mappers whether it be their own or that they have access to the other mappers in the system. Additionally it seems that Option 2 unnecessarily complicates the data access layer as it creates table access logic across multiple data mappers instead of confining it to a single data mapper.p  pSo, is it incorrect to make the domain objects aware of the related data mappers and to call data mapper functions directly from the domain objects p  pbUpdateb These are the only two solutions that I can envision to handle the issue of relations between domain objects. Any example showing a better method would be welcome.p

Is there a way to do read and write locking on a property that makes sense  Or should I just constrain myself to locking on sections of functions rather than the data itselfp  pJust so that this example makes sense  MyObject is a device driver that returns status asynchronously.  I send it commands via a serial port, and then the device responds to those commands in its own sweet time.  Right now, I have a thread that polls it for its status Are you still there  Can you accept commands, a thread that waits for responses on the serial port Just got status string 2, everythings all good, and then the UI thread which takes in other commands User wants you to do this thing. and posts the responses from the driver Ive just done the thing, now update the UI with that.  Thats why I want to lock on the object itself, rather than the fields of the object that would be a huge number of locks, a, and b, not every device of this class has the same behavior, just general behavior, so Id have to code lots of individual dialogs if I individualized the locks.p

Negative 42676 pI am looking for a bit of clarification on how the algorithms implemented in Canny edge detection  a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCanny5Fedge5Fdetector relnofollowWikipedia entrya  work.  It seems pretty straightforward to perform noise reduction using a 2D Gaussian filter, but I have heard that using two 1D filters  how is this accomplished  Its also simple to calculate the gradient and edge direction.  However, when performing nonmaximum suppression is there a neat trick to getting the rounded angle  What Im currently doing is dividing the edge direction theta value by pi4, casting it to an integer and using a switch statement.  But, how does one handle the negative theta values  ie should pi4 be handled the same way as 3pi4 or the same as pi4 p  pAny advicelinks are much appreciatedp  pThanks, Benp

Upon which, all the connections in the Network Connections window indicate a solid connection, and my software can establish a socket across the bridge.p  pI am assuming that the windows software bridge uses some internal windows network state in order to decide whether or not to route packets from the various connections.p  pSo, my question is, what does that magical Refresh button do exactly And, more specifically, is there a way I can automate whatever that is in my softwarep  pCheersp

Negative 42676 pIve been playing around with a set of templates for determining the correct promotion type given two primitive types in C.  The idea is that if you define a custom numeric template, you could use these to determine the return type of, say, the operator function based on the class passed to the templates.  For examplep  precode Custom numeric class template ltclass Tgt struct Complex      ComplexT real, T imag  rreal, iimag      T r, i  Other implementation stuff    Generic arithmetic promotion template template ltclass T, class Ugt struct ArithmeticPromotion      typedef typename X type   I realize this is incorrect, but the point is it would                                figure out what X would be via trait testing, etc    Specialization of arithmetic promotion template template ltgt class ArithmeticPromotionltlong long, unsigned longgt      typedef typename unsigned long long type    Arithmetic promotion template actually being used template ltclass T, class Ugt Complexlttypename ArithmeticPromotionltT, Ugttypegt operator ComplexltTgtamp lhs, ComplexltUgtamp rhs      return Complexlttypename ArithmeticPromotionltT, Ugttypegtlhs.r  rhs.r, lhs.i  rhs.i  codepre  pIf you use these promotion templates, you can more or less treat your user defined types as if theyre primitives with the same promotion rules being applied to them.  So, I guess the question I have is would this be something that could be useful  And if so, what sorts of common tasks would you want templated out for ease of use  Im working on the assumption that just having the promotion templates alone would be insufficient for practical adoption.p  pIncidentally, Boost has something similar in its mathtoolspromotion header, but its really more for getting values ready to be passed to the standard C math functions that expect either 2 ints or 2 doubles and bypasses all of the integral types.  Is something that simple preferable to having complete control over how your objects are being convertedp  pTLDR What sorts of helper templates would you expect to find in an arithmetic promotion header beyond the machinery that does the promotion itselfp
Negative 42676 pIm fairly new to C, and Im likely in over my head, but thats the way it goes.p  pIm working with a fairly large Win32 C project that uses Winsock for its network communications.

Negative 42676 pWhen using shared memory, each process may mmap the shared region into a different area of its respective address space. This means that when storing pointers within the shared region, you need to a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1350dochtmlinterprocessoffsetptr.htmlstore them as offsetsa of the start of the shared region. Unfortunately, this complicates use of atomic instructions e.g. if youre trying to write a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLockfreeandwaitfreealgorithmslock free algorithma. For example, say you have a bunch of reference counted nodes in shared memory, created by a single writer. The writer periodically atomically updates a pointer p to point to a valid node with positive reference count. Readers want to atomically write to p because it points to the beginning of a node a struct whose first element is a reference count. Since p always points to a valid node, incrementing the ref count is safe, and makes it safe to dereference p and access other members. However, this all only works when everything is in the same address space. If the nodes and the p pointer are stored in shared memory, then clients suffer a race conditionp  ol lix  read pli liy  x  offsetli liIncrement refcount at yli ol  pDuring step 2, p may change and x may no longer point to a valid node. The only workaround I can think of is somehow forcing all processes to agree on where to map the shared memory, so that real pointers rather than offsets can be stored in the mmapd region. Is there any way to do that I see MAPFIXED in the mmap documentation, but I dont know how I could pick an address that would be safe.p  pEdit Using inline assembly and the lock prefix on x86 maybe its possible to build a increment ptr X with offset Y by value Z Equivalent options on other architectures Havent written a lot of assembly, dont know if the needed instructions exist.p

P.S. I can show code if necessary, but would like to know if this is a common issue by default.p
Negative 42676 pI am creating an Android app that includes a third party jar.

Negative 42676 pI am generating proxy classes to a clients java webservice wsdls and xsd files with svcutil. The first call made to each service proxy class takes a very long time. I was hoping to speed this up by generating the XmlSerializers assembly myself based on the article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa751883.aspx relnofollowHow to Improve the Startup Time of WCF Client Applications using the XmlSerializera, but when I do the first call to each service still takes the same amount of time. Here are the steps I am followingp  precodegenerate strong name key file sn k Blah.snk  generate the proxy class file svcutil blah.wsdl blah2.wsdl blah3.wsdl ... base.xsd blah.xsd ... UseSerializerForFaults serXmlSerializer n,SomeNamespace outBlah.cs  compile the class into an assembly signing it with the strong name key file csc targetlibrary keyfileBlah.snk outBlah.dll Blah.cs  generate the XmlSerializer code this will give us Blah.XmlSerializers.dll.cs svcutil txmlSerializer Blah.dll  compile the xmlserializer code into its own dll using the same key to sign it and referencing the original dll csc targetlibrary keyfileBlah.snk outBlah.XmlSerializers.dll Blah.XmlSerializers.dll.cs rBlah.dll codepre  pI then create a standard Console application that references both codeBlah.dllcode and codeBlah.XmlSerializers.dllcode. I will then try something likep  precodeBlahProxy is one of the generated service proxy classes BlahProxy p  new BlahProxy this call takes 30ish seconds p.SomeMethod  BlahProxy p2  new BlahProxy this call takes lt 1 second p2.SomeMethod  BlahProx2y is one of the generated service proxy classes BlahProxy2 p3  new BlahProxy2 this call takes 30ish seconds p3.SomeMethod  BlahProxy2 p4  new BlahProxy2 this call takes lt 1 second p4.SomeMethod codepre  pI know that the problem is not server side because I dont see the request made in Fiddler until around 29 seconds. Subsequent calls to each service take lt 1 second, so thats why I was hoping the main slow down was the .net runtime generating the xmlserializer code itself, compiling it and loading the assembly. I figured this would be the reason the first call to each service is slow and the rest are fast. Unfortunatley, me generating the code myself is not speeding anything up. Does anyone see what I am doing wrongp

Negative 42676 pI know you dont want to POST a form with a username and password where anyone could use the history to see or situations where repeat actions may not be desired refreshing a page  adding an item to a cart may not be desired. So i have an understanding when i may want to use one over the other. But i could always have the server redirect the url after a get to get around the cart problem and maybe most of my forms will work perfectly fine with get.p  pWHY should i use POST over get I dont understand the benefits of one over the other. I do notice post doesnt add data to the historyurl and will warn you about refreshing the page but those are the only two differences i know of. Why as a developer might i want to use one over the otherp

Negative 42676 pI recently migrated an iPhone project from the 2.2.1 SDK to 3.1.x and, to my surprise, an XML feed that was and still is with the published app being parsed by the 2.2.1 NSXMLParser is now causing NSXMLParser to return errors.p  pThe XML document in question doesnt meet the W3C standard, but the 2.2.1 parser is able to handle this.  Im curious if anyone knows what changed and, more importantly, if theres a way to relax the 3.1.x parser.  I dont have much control over the XML document, unfortunately, so I might have to get creative if I cant rely on the NSXMLParser to handle things as it did before.p

Negative 42676 pThis is to be an applicationagnostic question, but one Id like to get a better answer on.p  pWhat is the best setup to track users completing a challenge or goal Think similar to Stack Overflow, where if you hit a certain target youre awarded a badge.p  pCurrently, Im the developer of a website and attached Facebook application. I want to know the best way to track challenges completed. Currently, I have a single line of code sprinkled in with the actual controller code, which probably isnt the best way. Something like the followingp  precodeif uploadphoto  true      challengegtperform1  codepre  pAs you see, the above basically fires off a call to the codeperformcode method of the codeChallengecode class, which has a database lookup to see if the challenge threshold has been met thus far and if not, inserts a record and credits the member with the number of points associated with that challenge. The database setup for this is simple, as followsp  precodememberid INT challengeid INT codepre  pAnd to get the number of times a member has performed a specific challenge, I just run a codeCOUNT  AS count FROM tablename WHERE memberid   AND challengeid  code query.p  pBut is this the best setup I think not, and open to answers on how to improve this setup.p  pAs aforementioned, Im also in charge of developing a Facebook application associated with this website. There will be a progress bar that will allow users to perform certain actions and be rewarded for them. For example, bookmarking the application liking the application and suggesting the application to their Facebook friends.p  pUsing Facebooks PHP SDK I can query if these actions have been done. No problem there. My problem comes for users who will leave the application, then return at a later time when there sessions expired. When an action has been performed, should I store that as a record in a database table, and just query the database when a user logs into the app Or should I just do the checks on login and store the results in a session, overwriting the relavant session keys when they trigger the relavant actionp  pAny suggestions for improvement on this setup would be welcome. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 42676 pIve just encountered an interesting problem in a standard BoundField in a GridView.

The codeDataFormatString000000code attribute on the BoundField doesnt work, as I assume that format is only for numeric values.  p  pTo work around this, I had to use a TemplateField, and bind the text value using the attribute codeTextlt PadNumericStringEvalEmployeeCode.ToString, 5 gtcode.

Negative 42676 pI have a simple appWidget that displays an image.  The image is selected in the configuration activity and the widget is updated via the remove view.

I dont think that is relevant here.  Anyway, this work great.  The widget does exactly what I want it to.  Until I restart the device.  p  pWhen I restart the widget loads with the default view from the xml in the apk.  It does not keep the image update from the initial configuration. My questions is how do I get the widget to load back up after a restart with the updated view set during the configuration activity  I will also need to reset the onClick Pendingintent, but I will save that for later.  I expect they are related anyway.  So I am out of ideas.p

Negative 42676 pBoth are terms whose type is the intersection of all types uninhabited. Both can be passed around in code without failing until one attempts to evaluate them. The only difference I can see is that in Java, there is a loophole which allows codenullcode to be evaluated for exactly one operation, which is reference equality comparison codecodewhereas in Haskell codeundefinedcode cant be evaluated at all without throwing an exception. Is this the only differencep  h2Edith2  pWhat Im really trying to get at with this question is, why was including codenullcode in Java such an apparently poor decision, and how does Haskell escape it It seems to me that the real problem is that you can do something emusefulem with codenullcode, namely you can check it for emnullnessem. Because you are allowed to do this, it has become standard convention to pass around null values in code and have them indicate no result instead of there is a logical error in this program. Whereas in Haskell, theres no way to check if a term evaluates to bottom without evaluating it and the program exploding, so it could never be used in such a way to indicate no result. Instead, one is forced to use something like codeMaybecode.p  pSorry if it seems like Im playing fast and loose with the term evaluate... Im trying to draw an analogy here and having trouble phrasing it precisely. I guess thats a sign that the analogy is imprecise.p

Negative 42676 pIve got a Silverlight user control that contains a datagrid.  The datagrid is bound to an ObservableCollection.  The user control is displayed in a popup window that I show in response to some event in another controlp  pThere are about 80 objects in the collection, and Ive set a fixed height of 400 on the datagrid, so only about 20 items can be shown at one time, and the vertical scrollbar should be shown, with a thumb size occupying about 14th of the control height.p  pHowever, whats strongactuallystrong happening is that the scrollbar occupies almost the whole control height maybe 95 of it.  The datagrid displays the first 20 items.  When I click on the scrollbar down arrow, the scrollbar moves down a little to occupy the strongbottomstrong 95 of the scroll area, and the datagrid displays the stronglaststrong 20 items.p  pIt gets weirder.  If I move over the items in the grid and scroll down using the strongmouse wheelstrong, then the items scroll correctly and I can view the whole list, although the scrollbar remains the same size.p  pAnd strongthenstrong, if I close the popup and reopen it, the scrollbar now appears with the correct height and it works correctly.p  pFinally, if I just show the control directly on the page, and strongnotstrong in a popup, it works fine. Whats going on here  Has anyone else run into this problem  Helpp  pstrongUpdatestrong The problem seems to be the way that Im showing the popup.  For various reasons, I had to implement the popup display in a somewhat tricky way, and its this thats causing the trouble.p

Negative 42676 pI do Java web development work using Spring MVC and basically Im forced to do an Agile type of development where I have to make a lot of small changes and I sometimes end up wasting a lot of time having to compile each time I make a change  I work for a startup company and I am not given enough time to make unit tests, etc, this isnt ideal and I dont necessarily plan to stay with the company longterm but am just looking for ways to be more adaptable for the moment. p  pThe app Im working on needs to be fast and it does a lot of high volume data processing its sort of a search engine but not a web search engine so it has to be regular compiled Java for the production app but Im wondering if I used Groovy with Grails, or something similar, for development if I could just write it as regular Java but then test code in realtime without having to recompile. Im wondering how much effort would be involved in doing this as far as making it work then as compiled Java. Sorry if this is a newbie question I just am not sure where to look for info on this as most things about Grails seem more geared towards emulating scripting languages not what I am trying to use it for.p

But whatever i do i cant seem to get the individual cells to space properly. Origonally i had it built as a table but was told divs could behave like a table, and figured they would be easier to manipulate css, but no avail.p  pThe problems i run into is trying to change the widthpaddingmarginetc of the cells to create a spacing, generally warps the heightwidth of the thumbnail.p  pAlso another problem i had was the spacing between rows seems to just randomly have extra height for no reasonp  pIs there a better way to go about what im trying to do some sort of simple customizable grid layout or how can i get the spacing to be the way i want itp  pbackgroundstill trying to build a customizable image gallery based off jqueryjavascript so i can create a database to upload images to because i couldnt find anything i liked, heres what i have so far if your interested a hrefhttpdrewswinson.comDP relnofollowhttpdrewswinson.comDPap  pthanks for your timep

Negative 42676 pI need to be able to format unprinted logic lines in ERB without affecting the eventual text output of the template. At this point, I dont think that ERB supports such escaping.p  pThis is my first major Ruby project. I am writing a code generator. My templates will include a considerable number of conditionals and enumerations. To make the template readable and maintainable, I need to be able to format the logical code and comments without distorting the eventual output. p  pE.g. Suppose I want this outputp  precodeStarting erbOutput 1 2 3 4 Ending erbOutput codepre  pI naively wrote the template something like sop  precoderequire erb hltltH Starting erbOutput lt comment gt lt5.times do egt lte.tos  gt ltend gt lt comment gt Ending erbOutput H sERB.newh.result puts s codepre  p... but this produces p  precodeStarting erbOutput   0  1  2  3  4   Ending erbOutput codepre  pA straight printp  precodeStarting erbOutputnnn0nn1nn2nn3nn4nnnEnding erbOutputn codepre  p...makes it clear that the linereturns of the logic and comment lines are being included in the ERB output. p  pI can produce the desired output by cramming the template into this awkward formp  precodehltltH Starting erbOutputlt comment gt lt5.times do egtlte.tos  gt ltend gtlt comment gtEnding erbOutput H codepre  p... but I dont think I can debug and maintain templates without more readable formatting. Some of my conditionals and enumerations are as much as three levels deep and I comment heavily. Cramming all that on one or two lines makes the template utterly unreadable.p  pIs there a way to escape or otherwise suppress the line returns of logic an comment lines in ERB Does one of the other commonly available Ruby template modules handle this betterp  pIn case it matters, I am working in MacRuby 0.10 implements Ruby 1.9.2 on MacOS 10.6.7.p

Negative 42676 pOk so Ive been working on an ASP.NET project for a while and it seems Ive made some bad design choices that are coming back to haunt me as the project keeps on getting bigger and bigger in terms of contained data.p  pAfter reading up on .NET memory management, I think Ive identified a whole set of potential reasons. Since the stuff Im doing isnt particularly special, Im wondering if theres a standard pattern to achieve what I want to do that Im missing. p  pSo I have a somewhat expensive query which yields something between 1 and 20000 results. On subsequent requests, we may just be paging through the result set, so I store this result in the session. Session is InProc. Im wonderingp  ul lipDoes it make sense a to store the result b in a session c inprocess I want the speed of a. I dont know if theres a more efficient way than to store it by user b and if I use a more sophisticated state server  doesnt it rather get slower c Or could that be the solution, disposing of those large objects more quickly instead of keeping the last resultset in RAM until the session expirespli lipIf any result set   20000 rows ends up potentially messing up the LOH, is there a generic way to get around that pli ul  pI know this question is slightly underspecified. I just realized my overall design might be flawed w.r.t. scalability, and Im just trying to estimate just how flawed exactly. I hope that some hints about standard patterns might be collected that turn this into a generally useful question nevertheless.p

Negative 42676 pI have written a Silverlight application that is basically an account registration form.  I have been able to successfully deploy this to one of our production servers running windows server 2008IIS7.  While this took some time to do, I was able to work through and solve the issues that came up fairly easily.  Now I am trying to deploy the application on our main production server.  This server is running windows 2003IIS6 and this is where I have hit some problems.p  pI have solved most of the issues and now the silverlight application will load and I can see the form for a few seconds before it disappears.

Negative 42676 pIm currently working on programming widgets in Android, however Id like a second opinion on how I should go about designing them, particularly in regards to graphic sizes. p  pI have already read the App Widget Design Guidelines in the official documentation, where 1 cell on the home screen is said to be roughly 40dp. Given 8dp as margins, this means Ill be sizing my widget at 32dpx32dp for 1 cell. Using the calculator found a hrefhttplabs.skinkers.comcontentandroiddppxcalculator relnofollowherea, this equates to 24ldpi, 32mdpi, 48hdpi and 64xhdpi pixels for my widget graphic sizes. I will of course be using 9patch graphics. An icon within the widget will be appropriately sized for a given screen density, then stored in drawablemdpi or whichever is appropriate for the given graphic.p  pIs the discussed technique appropriate, or have I somehow overseen some major flaw One thing that does concern me is that 64px on a xhdpi screen seems rather small, seeing that launcher icons are i think 96px for xhdpi. Nevertheless, I would greatly appreciate any advice on the matter and whether or not I should be going about this a different way.p  pThanks.p

Negative 42676 pWell Im currently refactoring a class I made quite a long time ago. The class is a container type.p  pMany functions can use advantage of the class structure, and are thus implemented as member functions. However it now seems to be a lot of function which seem the same, ie a find functionp  precodeiterator findITEM constiterator findITEM const iterator findifITEM, PRED constiterator findifITEM, PRED const codepre  p4 functions to describe nearly the same and code is almost the same in each version. This becomes very tedious when updating the class, I have to make sure each version is upgraded. Is there a manner to handle these things better Some other function in the class emCANem possibly take 2 predicates, and that meant I suddenly had 8 functions to manage.p  pI tried calling the nonconstant version from the constant version but that obviously doesnt work.p  pSo how does one handle these things Just bite the bullet and write it downp  pEDIT just to inform my datastructure resembles a tree. Each object contains the data which the find searches and a list with subtrees. The find function works recursive over all subtrees of a tree and subsub trees.  Just like one would expect when searching a tree.p  pAs there isnt a clear end or start iterator to such a tree, using stdfind doesnt yield the correct functionality.p

My application runs on these clusters. I want to deploy my application on these nodes such that i dont need to bring all of them down at once. These days the deployments is done this way  we come at night to stop all the servers all at once from console. Then we install the application on the main node which is on the same machine as the deployment manager and then we synchronize and bring all the servers back up one by one. p  pemstrongWhat I am asked to doemstrong is that we upgrade the application or install the new ear file by not bringing everything down as this is causing downtime to the application. Is there a way to acheive this. WAS 7 is a very mature product i am sure there must be a way to do it. p  pI looked at the documentationtutorial we can do something like Update where we select the application from Apllications websphere enterprise applicationand select update and then select radio button Replace Entire Application and radio buttonlocal file system and point to the new ear file. But in that case the doc says that it will bring down all the servers as well when updating. its the same as before. no online deployment.p  pI am a java programmer so I thought of using what tools I have to solve this p  pemstrongTell me if this is can be an issueemstrong  p  p1 We bring down NODEA  2 We remove the NODEA from the cluster by pressing remove node button or using the removeNode.sh 3 Install the new Ear on the NODEA can we do this in the same admin console or through shell script or jython or may be like a standalone server 3 We then start it up back again and then add it to cluster. NOW we have NODEA with new applicaition while NODE B and NODEC are with old application versions.p  pThen we bring down NODEB  remove NODEB from cluster install applciation on NODEB  start it up again  Add it back to clusterp  pNOW we have two nodes with new application and NODEC with oldp  pwe try the same process for NODEC.p  pWill this work.

Negative 42676 pI am using a javascript method to sync the column widths of two tables. The code for the HTML, CSS, and Javascript are below. The table columns sync fine when the divs are the size of or larger than the tables, but when there is overflow currently hidden as Ill be adding scrolling later the table columns do not align. I know that the table widths and column widths are setting fine I use a logger to check the style.width of each, but they are displaying misaligned by around 12 px. p  pIve really been baffled by this for a while and could really use the help.

Negative 42676 pI have a nicely working custom CursorAdapter with customized ListView. This view allows the user to play around with their UI by rearranging the rows of the ListView.  No problem well, now after a lot of research and trial and error.p  pBut I dont like having to hit the database every time the user moves one of these rows.  They could be doing quite a bit of modifications.  Furthermore, I would like the ability for the user to change their mind and cancel all their changes.p  pSo I am wondering is there a way to modify the contents of this ListView ie, the orders of the rows without having to change the database  That way I could update the database when the user clicks OKAY in one swoop and ignore those changes if they cancel.p  pAlso with this theoretical technique, the user only has to wait ONCE for the AsyncTask to pop and do its database stuff instead of every single time they modify their list.p
Negative 42676 pThis query takes about 52 seconds to complete.  It appears 82 of the time is spent in the table scan of the orders table.

If I execute the query just to the orders line it will return 15,361 rows which is should only be returning no more than 4,416.p  pIf I execute the query to the orderlines it will return 20811 rows, again it should not be returning more than 4,416, less is ok, but not more.  It executes this in 1 seconds.p  pWhen I execute it down to the group row, it takes around 50 seconds to execute this query and returns 4,313 rows which seems to be the correct amount of rows.p  pAny idea what I am doing incorrectly herep  pEDITED AGAINp  precodeSELECT tmp.distid, tmp.busctrid, tmp.volume, r.description, d.fname, d.lname, d.email FROM  SELECT o.Distid, o.busctrid, SUM ol.volume  ol.quantity as Volume FROM Orders o INNER JOIN Orderlines ol  ON ol.orderid  o.orderid GROUP BY o.distid, o.busctrid HAVING SUM ol.volume  ol.quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 3011 tmp INNER JOIN Distributor d  ON d.distid  tmp.distid INNER JOIN Rank r  ON r.rankid  d.rankid INNER JOIN FuncGetDownline3,1 a  ON a.distid  tmp.distid  AND a.busctrid  tmp.busctrid ORDER BY tmp.DistID, tmp.BusCtrID  codepre  pThe above query executes in 1 second or less, Im nor why this is so much faster.

Negative 42676 pI use haystack with whoosh to search my companys code, every file per index. Most of the time, it works fine. However, when I search with some common keyword like port, the seaching takes 5 mins to finish, and the CPU is 100. I think this is because the result count is too large5000 for keyword port. Indeed, I dont need so many results, maybe 100 or so is enough. How can I set the limit or timeout is also OK.p

Negative 42676 pI want to create a large table about 45 billion rows that is always accessed by a unique key.p  pOutside of the DB, the best structure to hold this is a Dictionary or a HashSet, but of course due to the size of data, its not possible to do this outside of the database.p  pDoes SQL Server provide a structure thats optimized for keyvalue access I understand that a clustered key is very fast, but still its an index and therefore there will be some additional disk reads associated with traversing index pages. What I would like to get from SQL Server is a native structure that stores data as keyvalue pairs and then makes it possible to access values based on keys.p  pIn other words, my question is how to store in SQL Server 45 billion rows and efficiently access them WITHOUT having an index, clustered or nonclustered, because reading the index nonleaf pages may result in substantial IO, and since each value can be accessed by a unique key, it should be possible to have a structure where the hash of a key resolves into a physical location of the value. To get 1 value, we would need to do 1 read unless there are hash collisions. p  pan equivalent in Oracle is Hash Clusterp  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 42676 pIt has been a nice run of about 7 or 8 years now that we have developed Flash browser based games for the web exclusively.

Does Stage3D still work well enough in software mode on older machinesp  pOption 3 The new feature in CS6 that lets us publish to HTML5. Is this even close to mature enough to publish a full game The benefit of this solution is that it could run in the browser on the iPad instead of being a separate app.p  pThianks so much for any guidance.. Im also wondering about pitfalls, and optimization techniques involved in any of these. But it seems the underlying question in all this is should we use StarlingStage3D or notp

Negative 42676 pWe have two externallydefined, logically exclusive businesswise attached properties, both of which are inheritable.

However, since AProp2 is set on this object directly i.e. distance of 0 levels away vs AProp1 distance of 2 away, AProp2 takes precedence to our business logic.pli lipIn the case of GreatGrandChild, again since AProp1 is set Distance of 0 away, that takes precedence over AProp2 distance of 1 awaypli lipFinally, in the case of GreatGreatGrandChild, again, both AProp1 and AProp2 are picked up via inheritance, however since AProp1 was set closer in the hierarchy distance of 1 away vs AProp2 distance of 2 away, AProp1 is the one we want to use.pli ul  pIf I can find the source, I know I can simply walk the chain and count the distance away.  I just need the source.p  h2Noteh2  pFor the record, yes, they can both be set at the same level, in which case AProp2 would take precedence, but thats irrelevant to this question.p  pA property can also be reapplied see GreatGrandChild even using the emsameem value as a way to bump its priority.

Negative 42676 pIm trying to use git in a way that keeps some subdirectories in a project secrethidden from untrusted users, but visible to other trusted users. Note that this is not just write protection the untrusted users cant be allowed to read the secret files either. Id like the user experience to be as if it was a single git repo, rather than something like submodules.p  pIll tell you my only idea so far, in case that spurs some discussion or criticism. Im considering having two parallel repos behind the scenes on the server. Trusted users clonepullpush the trusted repo. Untrusted users clonepullpush the untrusted repo. When a commit is made to the trusted repo, it is filtered to remove secret content before being applied to the untrusted repo. Going the other direction, commits to the untrusted repo are filtered to avoid clobbering secret content before being applied to the trusted repo.p  pHow should I accomplish this goal Is my proposed solution crazyp

Negative 42676 pIm working on a project in J that parses large amounts of data from a text file. Java doesnt have a good way of checking if a string is an integer, so Im using parseInt inside a trycatch block.p  pI also have other trycatch blocks for file IO operations, etc. Sometimes I get CLR exceptions in other places where Id like Visual Studio to break, even though the error is handled. To do this, I go into the Exceptions menu and check Thrown. However, the Java exceptions apparently fall under CLR, but are not ASAICT specifically listed in that menu. So if I check Thrown for CLR, I get an error every single time an integer doesnt parse. This means I might have to hit continue 2030 times to get past the parsing to the error I want to look at.p  pIs there any way to disable breaking on Java exceptions while still breaking on CLR exceptionsp

The operation begins with codeBeginOperationcode and acquires the lock on the shared resource. There also the codeEndOperationcode method that releases the lock. codeEndOperationcode is typically called in another thread from a callback, thus I cant call codeMonitor.Exitcode in the codeEndOperationcode method.

Negative 42676 pI have written a Windows service in C to log all user logons and logoffs, and save them in a table on a server.p  pI have used a codewhilecode loop with codetruecode condition and check the systems current user every minute in this loop, so my service goes to strongStartingstrong status when i turn on my system.p  pEverything goes fine up to here, but the problem is that the codeOnStopcode method does not get called when I shut down my system.

Negative 42676 pI understand that for PrimeFaces components with the codewidgetVarcode property, I can use the codepwidgetVarmyComponentIdcode to get a codewidgetVarcode derived from the components ID. It would be nice if the same sort of functionality existed for codeltpremoteCommandgtcode so I could have multiple instances of the same type of composite component that uses codeltpremoteCommandgtcode.

Negative 42676 pIn learning how to use a hrefhttpsgithub.comcowboygruntgrunta, I am trying to make a simple coffeescript watchercompiler. The problem is, if I tell the codewatchcode task to watch several files, and one changes, it is going to pass all of the files to the codecoffeecode command. This means when you change 1 file, its going to recompile emallem of the files matching the codesrccode pattern. Instead, I want to only recompile the single file that changed that matches the codesrccode pattern.p  pHere is the codegrunt.jscodep  precodemodule.exports  functiongrunt    grunt.initConfig     coffee        app          src [testcasescontroller.coffee],         dest tmp,         options            bare true,           preservedirs true                     ,     watch        files [ltconfigcoffee.app.srcgt],       tasks [coffeeapp]            grunt.loadNpmTasksgruntcoffee   grunt.registerTaskdefault, coffee  codepre  pThis is using a hrefhttpsgithub.comavaladegruntcoffeegruntcoffeea, which is basically this a hrefhttpsgist.github.com2373159httpsgist.github.com2373159a.p  pWhen I run codegrunt watchcode, and I save a file in codetestcasescontroller.coffeecode, it compiles emallem of the matching files putting them in codetmpcode.p  pHow do you instead emonly compile the strongchangedstrong fileem using gruntp

Negative 42676 pI have a view controller that contains a button with six CAShapeLayer sublayers.

Negative 42676 pI am working on WPF. My application uses ICommands to bind Methods to Buttons. I initialized these commands as follows p  precodeAnswerCommand  new DelegateCommandAnsCommandExecute, AnsCommandCanExecute codepre  pI want to know if AnsCommandExecute method will work on UI thread or Background thread. If it works on UI thread do I have to create another thread for this execute method as my application performs lot of processing in background.p  pAlso my application uses TCP to communicate with one another application. so, for better performance Do I have to use different threads for Receiving Data, Processing, and Sending Data.  what will be the best Threading approach for such applicationsp
Negative 42676 pHow can I make it, that my app only opens in fullscreen So maybe you can make it smaller but the best way is to enable it only fullscreenp
Negative 42676 pWhy is my remove method removing every element from my Doubly Linked List  If I take out that ifelse statements then I can successfully remove middle elements, but elements at the head or tail of the list still remain.

Negative 42676 pthis is my first post at stackoverflow and im starting with a problem.p  pIm writing a gui application with qt in c.

Negative 42676 pThe below is an excerpt from a file in a project creating Huffman Trees. When the  public class HLinkedList is initialized by itself, the separate file also shown below of HTreeNode s methods such as .next, .left, .right have no problem working in HLinkedLists file. Once the extends java.util.Abstract is put in place, the HTreeNode methods cannot be referenced, and I resorted to copypasting HTreeNode into the same file, which is why the first lines of code show it as such. The thing with having both of these in the same file is that its causing collisionI think between HLinkedList.HTreeNode and HTreeNode, as I kept the HTreeNode file just in case. This happens in a separate file Huffmancoder which originally used both HLinkedList and HTreeNode files very well or at least without compile level error until I decided to extend java.util.Abstract p  precodepublic class HLinkedListltHTreeNodegt extends java.util.AbstractSequentialListltHTreeNodegt   public class HTreeNode        public HTreeNode left     public HTreeNode right     public HTreeNode next     public int frequency     public char value     public String code     public HTreeNodeint freq, char val, HTreeNode l, HTreeNode r, HTreeNode n, String code  code is the path taken to this node, how to explain it in code              value  val         frequency  freq         left  l         right  r         next  n         code    just initialized ,but have to think through logic.

Negative 42676 pIm working on a Windows batch file to perform a twoway sync with a server. The batch file will be used by multiple people to syncronize several computers with a single network location. Due to restrictions I wont get into, it HAS to be a batch file. No vbscript, no javascript, only windows batch. Powershell commands may be okay as long as I can run them from inside the batch file.p  pIn order to allow file deletions, it runs robocopy several times. First, it copies files newer than the last time the script was ran using the MAXLAD switch. It does this in both directions. Then, it does a mirror with the l switch and checks the exit code to detect extra files. If either side has extra files, it runs the mirror for real, in the appropriate direction.p  pThe script works well asis, but...p  pThe problem is, MAXLAD accepts a date in the form YYYYMMDD, so if you create a file locally, run the sync script, then immediately delete the file and sync again, it comes back from the grave. In order to successfully delete a file it needs to have been unmodified for a least a day prior to the last time you ran the script. I would like some way of removing this restriction, so it can be ran as often as my users please and work as expected.p  pMy question is this Is there some way to be more precise with the last access time Even if I could narrow it to the hour, itd be an improvement. Should I be doing something other than robocopy to copy the new filesp

Negative 42676 pI have problem in a piece of reallife code, where a function belonging to a deleted class is called by a codeboostasiodeadlinetimercode, occasionally leading to a segmentation fault.p  pThe issue Im having is that the deletion of the deadlinetimer is run from another timer on the same ioservice.

The object is being correctly validated, the data is correctly parsed from the view post onto the parameter and everything looks nice, except that, when I call the SaveChanges, the application stop responding and never comes back. I have a breakpoint just after that statement and it just never comes out of the SaveChanges.p  pIve already changed all my db to a local instance of SQL Server Express so that I could get the logged SQL statement sent to the db. Theres nothing wrong with it either except from the fact that theres a ROLLBACK at the end, but the .NET dont take any action at all  no exception, no nothing, check out the log of the actions triggered by the SaveChangesp  precode20121128 164643.10 spid52      ODS Event Login connection 52 20121128 164643.10 spid52      ODS Event Remoteods  Xact 0 ORS 1, connId 0 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Xact BEGIN for Desc 3400000006 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 0 Name,Flags0,Xvt231,MaxLen558,Len558,Pxvar Valueinsert [dbo].[Lote][IDTipoEdificacao], [IDGleba], [IDOutorgante], [Numero], [FracaoIdeal], [AreaAntiga], [AreaNova], [Obs], [DocumentoExtra] values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, null select [IDLote] from [dbo].[Lote] where ROWCOUNT gt 0 and [IDLote]  scopeidentity 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 1 Name,Flags0,Xvt231,MaxLen156,Len156,Pxvar Value0 int,1 int,2 int,3 nvarchar20,4 real,5 real,6 real,7 nvarchar1000 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 2 Name0,Flags0,Xvt56,MaxLen4,Len4,Pxvar Value3 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 3 Name1,Flags0,Xvt56,MaxLen4,Len4,Pxvar Value1 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 4 Name2,Flags0,Xvt56,MaxLen4,Len4,Pxvar Value0 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 5 Name3,Flags0,Xvt231,MaxLen40,Len2,Pxvar Value1 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 6 Name4,Flags0,Xvt59,MaxLen4,Len4,Pxvar Value0 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 7 Name5,Flags0,Xvt59,MaxLen4,Len4,Pxvar Value0 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 8 Name6,Flags0,Xvt59,MaxLen4,Len4,Pxvar Value0 20121128 164643.10 spid52      Parameter 9 Name7,Flags0,Xvt231,MaxLen2000,Len8,Pxvar ValueObs1 20121128 164643.10 spid52          IPC Name spexecutesql 20121128 164643.10 spid52      ODS Event execrpc  Xact 3400000006 ORS 1, connId 0 20121128 164643.40 spid52      ODS Event Remoteods  Xact 3400000006 ORS 1, connId 0 20121128 164643.40 spid52      Xact ROLLBACK for Desc 3400000006 codepre

Negative 42676 pCurrently I am working on a Delphi XE3 clientserver application to transfer files with the Indy FTP components. The client part monitors a folder, gets a list of the files inside, uploads them to the server and deletes the originals. The uploading is done by a separate thread, which processes files one by one. The files can range from 0 to a few thousand and their sizes also vary a lot.p  pIt is a Firemonkey app compiled for both OSX and Windows, so I had to use TThread instead of OmniThreadLibrary, which I preferred. My customer reports that the application randomly freezes. I could not duplicate it, but since I dont have so much experience with TThread, I might have put deadlock condition somewhere. I read quite a lot of examples, but Im still not sure about some of the multithread specifics.p  pThe app structure is simplebr A timer in the main thread checks the folder and gets information about each file into a record, which goes into a generic TList. This list keeps information about the names of the files, size, the progress, whether the file is completely uploaded or has to be retried. All that is displayed in a grid with progress bars, etc. This list is accessed only by the main thread. After that the items from the list are sent to the thread by calling the AddFile method code below. The thread stores all files in a threadsafe queue like this one a hrefhttpdelphihaven.wordpress.com20110506usingtmonitor2httpdelphihaven.wordpress.com20110506usingtmonitor2abr When the file is uploaded the uploader thread notifies the main thread with a call to Synchronize.br The main thread periodically calls the Uploader.GetProgress method to check the current file progress and display it. This function is not actually threadsafe, but could it cause a deadlock, or only wrong data returnedp  pWhat would be a safe and efficient way to do the progress check p  pSo is this approach OK or I have missed something How would you do thisbr For example I though of making a new thread just to read the folder contents. This means that the TList I use has to be made threadsafe, but it has to be accessed all the time to refresh the displayed info in the GUI grid. Wouldnt all the synchronization just slow down the GUIp  pI have posted the simplified code below in case someone wants to look at it. If not, I would be happy to hear some opinions on what I should use in general. The main goals are to work on both OSX and Windows to be able to display information about all the files and the progress of the current one and to be responsive regardless of the number and size of the files.p  pThats the code of the uploader thread.

Negative 42676 pI come from a client side programming background C mostly. However, I now have the occasional need to get into some small server side projects in Java amp hence need some advice from experienced server side people. I dont really understand much about Application servers.p  pAre there any thumb rules or considerations to decide when a program needs an application server like GlassFish or JBossp  pI have 2 servers written in Java both running on dedicated machines. One server runs on Tomcat without any App Server. The second server runs on an application serverGlassfish.p  pI need to write a rather simple program which sits in the middle. This is what the program will dop  ul liplisten on a socket. When a connection comes from the first server, it creates a thread to accept the connection amp continue listening.pli lipthe thread gets a small amount of data say 100200 bytes from the first server, does very minor formatting of the data amp passes it on to the second server through a webservice call. It takes return value of the webservice call, and based on it does some processing  may be around 1020 lines of code  this is not some major processing  just a few  webservice calls on a different 3rd server. After this, it returns some data back to the first server  again not much  may be 50 bytes.pli lipMy program is not a webservice. It just gets messages from the first server in a particular format amp makes a webservice call to the 2nd server based on the data received from the first server. In someways you can think of it in this way  it acts as a proxy for the first server to make a webservice call into the 2nd server. pli ul  pAll the major work is done by the first server running by the app running on the Tomcat Server amp the Web Services running on GlassFish. These both are well tested programs. The middle program I want to write is pretty simple amp I can get it done in half day. However, what I am worried about is if it will be able to take the load.p  pWhat kind of rulesconsiderations are there to figure out if I can just run this Java program as a regular windows service or do I need something like Glassfish or any other Application Server.p  pShould I consider the number of connections coming in per minutehour I will be forking a thread for each connection but the thread itself would not be very long lived. At what threshold of number of connections should I consider an Application Server Are there any other considerations I would highly prefer to avoid an Application Server, if possible. p  pWhether to run it under an App Server is just one question  are there any more questions I am missing herep
Negative 42676 pI would like to know how if it is possible could I program a Java class using a data layout codeArray of Classcode, for examplep  precodepublic class X       double a      double b      double c   public X arrayofx[SIZE]  new X [SIZE] codepre  pbut internally the data would be store as a layout of codeClass of Arrayscode like thisp  precode public class X       double a[]  new double [SIZE]      double b[]  new double [SIZE]      double c[]  new double [SIZE]   public X classx  new X codepre  pMy objective is that the programmer could programed in a more intuitive style like the first one, but internal I would do transformations so the data could be continuous in memory, and I would achieve more performance.p  pIs there any way of doing this so it could accept any class with the first type of struct and be able to convert it to the second approach or is any tool that is able to do this type of transformation.p

Negative 42676 pSo Im thinking of using the Eigen matrix library for a project Im doing 2D space simulator. I just went ahead and profiled some code with EigenVector2d, and with bare arrays. I noticed a 10x improvement in assigning values to elements in the array, and a 40x improvement in calculating the dot products.p  pHere is a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4264844 relnofollowmy profilinga if you want to check it out, basically its 4.065s against 0.110s.p  pObviously bare arrays are much more efficient at dot products and assigning stuff. So why use the Eigen library or any other library, Eigen just seemed the fastest Is it stability Complicated maths that would be hard to code by yourself efficientlyp
Negative 42676 pIve created a Wordpress landing page which currently converts at 14. I removed sidebar and footer to keep the page less distracting. p  pI think the page can convert even better if I remove the menu from the top. However when I try to create a custom page template it doesnt work. I cannot remove the header without breaking up the whole layout.p  pCan anyone point me the right directionp  pThanksp

Negative 42676 pI need to set some emcontext before every database operationem I have tried using Oracles packagelevel variables, but due to some issues with package recompilation, I will experiment with a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1930601appdev.102b14258dsessio.htmBHCCFGIF relnofollowDBMSSESSIONa andor a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1930601appdev.102b14258dappinf.htmCHECEIEB relnofollowDBMSAPPLICATIONINFOa, so that we can get specific user info anywhere we need it procedures, triggers, etc., instead of having dozens of database connections identified as JBoss.p  pI have written a Java EE interceptor that intercepts calls to a Stateless bean. It calls an Oracle function to set some session context look at this question for some sample code a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14004504howtotellifatransactionisactiveinajavaee6interceptorHow to tell if a transaction is active in a Java EE 6 interceptora.p  pstrongMy first worry was connection poolingstrong. At first I thought that the default PersistenceContext propagation provided by Java EE would be enough to guarantee that everything runs in the same connectiontransactionEntityManager, and I only had to unset everything at the end of my interceptor in a codefinallycode block before the connection is returned to the pool. It seemed a little fragile, but I thought it could work.p  pstrongThen I found out that Hibernate has a property called hibernate.connection.releasemodestrong a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernateorm4.1manualenUShtmlsingleconfigurationjdbcproperties relnofollowHibernate docs about hibernate.connection.releasemodea, a hrefhttpsaccess.redhat.comknowledgedocsenUSJBossEnterpriseWebServer1.0htmlHibernateCoreReferenceGuidetransactionsconnectionrelease.html relnofollowRed Hat docs about org.hibernate.ConnectionReleaseModea and that the strongdefault and recommendedstrong behavior when using JTA transactions is to strongrelease the connection after every statementstrong although the docs say something about emreacquiring the same underlying connectionem, which just confused me.p  pNow Im not even sure I can reliably set something in an interceptor that will be visible only to this useroperation without the risk of somebody else grabbing the same connection in the middle of my business method and making a mess with my user context. As I understand it, Oracle database session variables are kept for a connection, not for a transaction or a PersistenceContext the database knows nothing about the persistence context after all, and a connection can be used for multiple transactions.p  pIm about to give up because this is looking more and more fragile as I learn more about the implementation details of all the technologies involved. strongCan this emuser contextem idea be made to work or should I try a totally different approach And how could I testdebug my implementation to be sure there arent any concurrency issues lurking aroundstrong I havent found any useful event listener to monitor the framework behavior, and building a program to stress test the server is too much work to invest in something Im not sure is supposed to work anyway.p  pIm using JBoss AS 7.1, EJB 3.1, an Oracle 10g database, and JPA 2.0 backed by Hibernate, although we do not use any Hibernatespecific API.p

Negative 42676 prelatively simple question that I am struggling to find a nice elegant solution to. I have a grid with a column that displays values that update every n seconds.

Negative 42676 pI want to run some excel vba code from my Windows Service. The Service is using a fileSystemWatcher to monitor a directory for an xml file to be added. Once a file is added the content of the xml file is deserialized into object properties. At this stage I want to open an excel file and pass these values in to certain cells and run vba code from that work book. I have this working perfectly from a windows forms application but I cant get it working from my Windows Service application. I attached a debugger to the application to try and see what was happening but there were no errors thrown and all the steps completed successfully.

Negative 42676 pI have 2 problems that I need help withp  pThe first problem is to show the strings in the list which I have imported from the file. Instead of showing the names, I get the name of the namespace  the name of the class ex. codeinuppv9.boycode. Ive tried to override the strings codeToStringcode but then the list doesnt show anything at all after that.p  pThe second thing that I need help is that I need to use gender as an argument in the constructor for the codePersoncode class, and that it is appropriate to use an enum for gender. But the problem is that I have no idea for what or how to use it. If anybody can come up with an idea that I can use, and how to use it would be great. p  pFor example I have been thinking to use the gender that when I create a new name it will set the name to either male or female depending on which of the 2 radiobuttons I check.

Negative 42676 pI have a custom class and I want to overload several artihmetic operators, and wonder if there is a way to avoid having to write out the code for each one individually.  I havent been able to find any examples that dont explicity overload each operator onebyone.p  precodeclass Fooobject     a0       def initself, a         self.aa                  def addself, other         common logic here         return Fooself.aother.a      def subself, other         common logic here           return Fooself.aother.a      def mulself, other         common logic here         return Fooself.aother.a  etc... codepre  pThe logic is slightly more complex than this, but the common pattern is that each operator overload method contains some identical code to check that the operation is allowed, and then constructs an operation using the class members. I want to reduce the redundant code.  This works p  precodeclass Fooobject     a0       def initself, a         self.aa                  def operateself, other, operator         common logic here         a  constructOperationself.a, other.a, operator         return Fooa      def addself, other         return self.operateother,       def subself, other                return self.operateother,         def constructOperationoperand0, operand1, operator     if operator          return operand0  operand1     if operator          return operand0  operand1 codepre  pBut it seems kind of silly to be constructing operations manually like that.

It works just fine. However, if searching for a phrase that contains a literal ampersand, such as LewisampClark, i tried the obvious of url encoding the ampersand p  blockquote   pLewis26Clarkp blockquote  pbut even so the request is never even routed, but the server immediately returns a 400 Bad Request. It is clear that it is being interpreted as a query string delimiter, and makes the request invalid since this particular template is expecting a url parameter and has no preceeding  delimiter. p  pSince these search phrases may have other restricted characters, they are expected to by url encoded by the client, and when they are successfully routed, the REST api calls HttpUtility.UrlDecode on the parameter. So my question is really if there is some technique to getting a url encoded ampersand correctly routed as a rest url parameter and not preemptively interpreted and rejected as a query string delimiterp  pUpdate For the record, if the search term were expected as a query string parameter not a url parameter, sending emLewis26Clarkem works fine.

Negative 42676 pAs a Joomla novice developer, Im concerned about why we really need modules to create our own forms. Im definitely not an authority on the subject when it comes to Joomla but heres my issue.p  pI understand through handson discovery that we can create forms using two ways without additional custom modules.p  ol lipBy writing the form content straight in the index.php page, then checking for submit using PHP.pli lipBy inserting the HTML content for the form as a CustomHTML article using the admin backend. Then have a separate PHP page to do the processing and return back to a specific landing page.pli ol  pFirst Im not sure if the above methods are considered sane in the joomla world but I do think theyre workable.p  pIf so, why do we need to run through rough seas trying to download and install formbuilder plugins and write code that looks pretty absurd with so many files.p

Negative 42676 pUsing Extjs 4.2p  pI have read many docs,google,forums trying to understand how components load and where to place them such as stores, models, ect but still confused.p  pThis is an example I am trying to get workingp  pApplication descriptionp  pMain menu with Contacts,Projects,People ect ect, app first loads to display a static non datadriven, then use clicks on Contacts which displays a grid with list of contacts.  User then clicks on a contact row and popup edit view is displayed.p  pIn contacteditview the contact is loaded into the form in addition the form has a combobox that loads ContactTypes store.  The ContactType should be set to contacttype value for that contact record.p  pWhat is the common way to do this considering this is a large application and I only want to load the data when it is need ie the view is displayed.p  pHere are some of my confusionsp  p1 You can define all of you Controllers, Stores, Models, Views in the app config, but then everything is loaded no matter what page you are looking at.  In addition if you have autoLoad true on your stores then calls for all the stores are made to the database even though you are not looking at that particular view.p  p2When you specify a store or model in the stores or models property in your controller, what exactly does that do  Is it just letting you easily reference the store but not actually creating it or does it create it or is it just setting getter and setter functions for convienance.  Example if I specify a store in the store property of my controller and have autoLoad true all data is loaded with no need to do anything else.  But what I really want is for that store to only load when I click on Contact and the list view is displayed.  So I set autoLoadfalse and in my list function I manually get store using this.getStoreContacts. This works fine, but what is purpose of using stores and models array property of controller.  I see in debugger that if I do not use the storemodel properties a get request is made for those js files.p  pSorry I know this is alot but it is very confusing to me and have been struggling with it for awhile.p  p3Lastly, I have the Contact grid loading only when you click on the Contacts button by setting autoLoadfalse and manually loading.  Now when a user clicks edit the record loads fine but how do I get the combobox to load and then select the correct value.  I think part of my problem is understanding how stores models get loaded and instantiated.  In my combobox store property I have specified ContactType as the store but I get error store undefined, so either the js file is not loaded or store is not instantiated.p  pHere is my code so far.p

Negative 42676 pI have a codeHistoricRecvLinecode that I use as an interface to a codetwisted.internet.protocol.ProcessProtocolcode class.

To be clearer, I want to have stdoutstderr messages of the sub process created by the ProcessProtocol appear in the my CLI implementation of the HistoricRecvLine. p  pAnyone knows how to do that or can point me to the right directionp

Negative 42676 pIs there any way to read System.Web.Optimization contents from codebehind I tried poking around the dll, but I couldnt find a way to read the bundle contents as far as I can tell, it was meant to work via a handler, which handles the calls to the bundles.p  pMy intent is to use sass, which would cause heavier processing because of the transformations on top of the minification, and generate it as a file, which will then be served to the enduser.

Negative 42676 pIm using a java server to connect to a browser with secure websockets. All works fine with the connect, but many times i get an unexpected 1 result from socket.in.readbuffer,off,len, this happens also in the middle of a frame. Normally i close a socket directly upon reception of 1, since it is end of stream. However i noted that it can also happen on a connection reset. I have come over many cases where in my tests the socket whould return valuable data after read returned 1. I even have the feeling this is more often than not. My problem arrises when sometimes i just get some scrambled data out of the socket after such a case. Another problem is that the other side is not notified when a frame cannot be delivered... So what good is TCPSSL than if you need to consider it an unreliable connection for transporting websocket frames in javap  pI have some schemes to use that are used to deal with unreliable connections for making shure a packet arrives.

So even if you are reading halfway the frame and receive a 1 then you should test somehow if the socket is closed or not, i now use socket.isInputShutdown. if this is not the case then just continue filling up the buffer. To do so i now use the following code where socket is the SSLSocketp  precodepublic static int readFullySocket socket, InputStream is, byte[] buffer, int off, int len throws IOException      int read  0     whileread lt len              int b  is.read         ifb lt 0                      Logger.logTAG, readFully read returned   b   testing if connection is reset or closed., Logger.WARNING             ifsocket.isInputShutdown                              throw new IOExceptionInputStream closed before data could be fully read readFully read returned 1 and socket.isInputShutdown is true                               else                      buffer[off  read]  byte b                   return read  codepre  pIt is still not a hundred  correct but at leas i get more reliable results then before.p

Negative 42676 pI am working on Asp.Net MVC. I am trying to integrate Facebook with my web application using Facebook Graph API. I am using OAuth mechanism to pull data from facebook. At first step i have called the endpoint like,p  precodehttpswww.facebook.comdialogoauthclientidappidampredirecturiredirecturiampscopeemail,readstream,publishstream,readfriendlists codepre  pThat means, User was redirected to facebook login page and he enters his credentials and after the confirmation of valid credentials it asks for permissions like codepublic profile Info, email,etc.code in first dialog. In second dialog, it asks for codepost on your wall behalf of youcode if the user select ok for all permissions he gets redirected back to redirect uri with authroization code. and i get access token using this endpoint like,p  precodehttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthaccesstokenclientidappidampredirecturiredirecturiampclientsecretappsecretampcodeauthorization code codepre  pand also i extended this shortlived access token likep  precode httpsgraph.facebook.comoauthaccesstokengranttypefbexchangetokenampclientidappidampredirecturiredirecturiampclientsecretappsecretampfbexchangetokenaccesstoken above codepre  pand i got the access token and save it into my database.p  pAnd i just inspect the permission of the user that he selects just before using Graph API Explorer and i got the response like,p  precodeinstalled 1,  basicinfo 1,  email 1,  userlikes 1,  userphotos 1,  usernotes 1,  usersubscriptions 1, publishstream1, readstream1, readfriendlists1 codepre  pok everything works fine upto now. Now i logged out from facebook site and decided to login freshly through my app. after login into facebook and it does not allow me to redirect to my site it always stuck into that facebook login page and i observe the address bar url at the end of it says user denied and error code 200. and i check the permissions for the user using graph api explorer and i got response like,p  precodeinstalled 1,  basicinfo 1,  email 1,  userlikes 1,  userphotos 1,  usernotes 1,  usersubscriptions 1 codepre  phere i observe that i lost the extended permissions codepublishstream,readstreamcode thats why it does not allow me to my site. But if already logged in facebook site and access my site i am able to access user profile, timeline etc. without getting any error. and also if i add codeauthtypereauthenticatecode along with scope it succeeds me however it asks user for login about 2 times that is not my requirement. Why extended permissions are lost from second time login. Please guide me if i went wrong in my process. Thank you.p

Negative 42676 pAt application level, say using java, how much do I have to worry about the actual TCP packet size So, for example, I am trying to write an application that should send data over TCP sockets outputstream, do I have to always keep into account the size of the data written to the stream Since java sockets are streaming sockets, I havent actually considered the size of data units, but the TSO TCP Segmentation offload is turned on for the OSNIC, then I can write a 64KB data slice or MSS to the outputstream and thus try to save the precious CPU time of slicing the data to less than 1500 bytes lt MTU. How effective could my programming be, in terms of being able to take care of this dynamically I know we can get NetworkInterface.getMTU to determine OSNIC MTU size, but not sure how it can help that.  So, I can say that overall, I am a bit confused on how to maximize my throughput of byte writing to the outputstream. p

Some other search results indicate it might be a connection pool issue, but Im seeing this error on my very first access of the app, so I presume there isnt a chance for multiple connections to even have been made at this point My database.yml uses the default size of 5 for the connection pool.p  pIve been googling and experimenting for the past day, and Im pretty stumped at this point.p

Negative 42676 pI have a codeUITableViewcode with a prototype cells that I have created using IB. I have a codeUILabelcode in this prototype cell. I have set the tag value of 5 to this codeUILabelcode so that I can identify it using codeviewForTagcode method. I have also defined 20 private property like thisp  precodepropertynonatomic, strong UILabel label1 propertynonatomic, strong UILabel label2 . . . propertynonatomic, strong UILabel label20 codepre  pNow, while creating cell from codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode I am assigning codeUILabelcode of each row to the corresponding property label1 for row 1, label2 for row 2,... etc. using codeself.label1  UILabel[cell viewForTag5]5 is the Tag value i have setup using IBcode.p  pEverything is fine till now. Now, when I run this app, i see that properties till 16 has proper values, rest are null. This is because only the first 16 cell has been drawn so remaining properties are still not have been assigned the corresponding codeUILabelcode. Everything is fine till here. Now when I scroll the table so that remaining 4 cells are on screen and first 4 cells goes offscreen. now, when i print using codeNSLog,self.label1.textcode. the value of each property, I found, the properties whose corresponding labels are on screen outputs correct value, whereas, those which are offscreen outputs random values not null, just random values, can be off other properties too.p  pIn normal scenario the first thing came to my mind is as soon as the rows goes offscreen they are deallocated and hence the properties are now pointing to some random location dangling pointer. But here in my case, properties are codestrongcode so the corresponding UILabel should not b deallocated till this pointer exist. Can anybody please explain whats happening here p

I will highlight it below for anyone who encounters such a need in the future.p  pMy company deals with buku amounts of traffic. As a result, we need a way to manage the excess, and direct it where needed. The goal was to write some sort of click counter that would allow us to maintain click caps If we get the max number of clicks per day on one ad, and we dont want to waste our traffic by sending it to that site and those ads, we wanted to be able to redirect to another.p  pWe are going to use Redis for this task, since the io of using a database in situations where traffic is extremely heavy would exhaust the db, and using a filesystem solution is out of the question for the same reason and as described below, would result in file locking, and loss of click logging. p  pSomething like this p  precoderedis  new Redis redisgtconnect127.0.0.1, 6379  redisgtsetkey, val  echo redisgtgetkey  redisgtincr counter, 1   increment your counter counter  redisgtget counter  if  counter gt 100000  redirect site1  redirect site2  codepre  pThanks to everyone who helpedp

Negative 42676 pI am having a problem with unobtrusive validation because I have a collection of controls and all have the same strongnamestrong.  I would appreciate any input and will consider and entirely different approachp  pMy controls need the same name because they bind with a collection in the model and MVC4 uses control names for this this is working. Unobtrusive validation finds the control based on the name so its always finding the last one.p  pHere are all the detailsp  pI have a collection of Strings in my model.p  precodepublic ListltStringgt Signatures  get set  codepre  pThe strings are bound to a collection of textBoxes in the view.  The number of textBoxes is based on a selection from a radio button.  If they choose 0 none are shown, choose 1 and one is shown, 2 and I show 2, up to a max of three.p  pI just put 3 textBoxes in the view and use client side jQuery to show or hide based on the radio button selected.p  pIn the view, each textbox is an html Helper class bound with the model.  Here is an example with two textboxes. I add the validation span manually under eachp  precodeHtml.TextBoxForm gt m.Signatures, new  class   firstSigLabel   ltspan classfieldvalidationvalid datavalmsgforSignatures datavalmsgreplacetruegtltspangt Html.TextBoxForm gt m.Signatures, new  class   secondSigLabel ltspan classfieldvalidationvalid datavalmsgforSignatures datavalmsgreplacetruegtltspangt codepre  pWhen save is clicked the action method correctly binds the two textBoxes with the Signatures collection.p  pNow I need to add validation, which depends on the textBoxes that I am actually showing the number from the radio button.  I want the client side to work the same as it would if I just let MVC handle it unobtrusive validation.  We have a library that depends on this for some common tasks like showing an indicator.p  pWhen I show a text box, I use jQuery to add the attributes needed for unobtrusive validation and remove them when I hide it.  That way, if it is shown it is required and if it is hidden it is not required.  Here are the inputs once they are visiblep  precodeltinput idSignatures class firstSigLabel typetext value nameSignatures  datavalrequiredEnter a first Signature Label. datavaltruegtltinputgt ltinput idSignatures class secondSigLabel typetext value nameSignatures datavalrequiredEnter a second Signature Label. datavaltruegtltinputgt codepre  pI also reregister the from with unobtrusive validationp  precodetheForm.removeDatavalidator .validator.unobtrusive.parsetheForm codepre  pMy problem is that unobtrusive validation uses the strongdatavalmsgforstrong attribute in the SPAN, to find the element by strongnamestrong.  However, I have two inputs with that name and its always finding the last one.p  pI have tried changing the ID Signatures1, Signatures2 but that does nothing.p  pI cannot figure out how to change the name in the html helper, but if I do it will break the model binding in the controller.p  pI know this is not simple  it is really obtrusive validation.  I dont know how to accomplish this with annotations since it is dependent on client side actions.p  pI assume if I used ValidationMessageFor on three textboxes, bound to the same model property, I would still get this problem.p  pIs there a way to overcome thisp  pAm I missing somethingp  pCan you think of a better approachp

Negative 42676 pI need to train a cascaded classifier to detect vehicles and different viewing angles.

Is there another way to build positive samples for diagonally placed anglesperspectives of objects I do need the classifier to be able to recognize this specific view of an object. It isnt so bad in the car above, because a car doesnt have a huge difference between its length and width. But if I do the same with a truck for example, which is several times longer than it is wide, then the images end up having more background than object of interest in them, like below. Im worried about whether this is good or bad for classification, and if theres any solution. p  pWill a classifier recognize a specific angle of a vehicle regardless of which way its rotated on the background And in that case, would it be better to rotate the entire truck image such that the truck is horizontalvertical, then clip the rest of the image p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTIvdt.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 42676 pI know Ive asked a few variations of this question, but I havent been able to find an answer yet.p  pIm creating UTF8 encoded XML from the contents of a forums database. The language Im using is serverside JavaScript which can retrieve data from the NoSQL objectoriented database and Im generating XML output from that.p  pMost of the database content is UTF8. But for historical reasons the site used to be ISO88591 some user names e.g. Andr and some profile info have accented or special characters in them which were originally encoded in ISO88591. p  pIf I know which content is really ISO88591 I can simply manually edit their profiles in my browser which is set to UTF8 because the charset of the page is now UTF8 and when I do so the new content becomes UTF8.p  pI can see the before and after, because if I look at the users profile in UTF8 at first it looks like there is an invalid character which doesnt display correctly. But if I force the page to display in ISO88591 the accented character shows up, and if I switch back to UTF8 and edit the profile and view it it all looks fine then. So if I can locate the characters I can fix them.p  pThe problem is I dont know how to locate such characters algorithmically. There must be SOME way of doing it, because if I try to load the XML I create all my browsers Chrome, Safari and FireFox wont load the XML content and report an invalid encoded character at such and such a line and such and such a column.p  pWhen that happens, sure enough if I open the file in vi in Linux I can see the invalid character there, and I can see whose record it is and I can edit the persons profile and regenerate the XML.p  pBut the browsers only report the first instance of an error and then stop. So I have to do this over and over again, trying to track down each error.p  pIf there was some way of doing a test of the characters, using JavaScript, I can go through the entire database first and identify all the characters which are not valid encoded UTF8. p  pThere must be  just must be  some way of doing it. Otherwise how else would the browsers themselves be able to report the errorp  pI would be grateful if somebody can point me to some JavaScript function or method or anything I can use to check the characters myself and find them so I can go in and fix them.p  pThanksp  pdougp

Negative 42676 pGiven an array with codexcode elements, I must find four numbers that, when summed, equal zero. I also need to determine how many such sums exist.p  pSo the cubic time involves three nested iterators, so we just have to look up the last number with binary search.p  pInstead by using the cartesian product same array for X and Y we can store all pairs and their sum in a secondary array. So for each sum codedcode we just have to look for codedcode.p  pstrongThis should look something like for close to quadratic timestrongp  precodepublic static int quadDouble[] S    ArrayListltDoublegt pairs  new ArrayListltgtS.length  S.length   int count  0    for Double d  S      for Double di  S        pairs.addd  di            Collections.sortpairs    for Double d  pairs      int index  Collections.binarySearchpairs, d     if index gt 0 count  d was found so increment       return count  codepre  pWith codexcode being 353 for our specific array input, the solution should be 528 but instead I only find 257 using this solution.

We are only dealing with 353 elements in our array, so would this mean anything to usp  pEDITEDIT I apologize if I use BigDecimal incorrectly. I have never dealt with the library before. So after multiple suggestions I tried using BigDecimal insteadp  precodepublic static int quadDouble[] S    ArrayListltBigDecimalgt pairs  new ArrayListltgtS.length  S.length   int count  0    for Double d  S      for Double di  S        pairs.addnew BigDecimald  di            Collections.sortpairs    for BigDecimal d  pairs      int index  Collections.binarySearchpairs, d.negate     if index gt 0 count       return count  codepre  pSo instead of 257 it was able to find 261 solutions.

Negative 42676 pI am using ngGrid to display some data. Some of my fields are using a cell template to display an input field, whilst the others are not using any cell template.p  pngGrid adds a codetabindexcode attribute to the cells. I have removed this attribute from all the cells using jQuery just testing in my browser console for now that are not input fields in order to allow the user to just tab through the input fields in the row as well as tried setting the value of the attribute to code1code. This does not seem to be respected as when I tab through the fields, the focus still goes to the columns that are labels.p  pThe options for my ngGrid are belowp  precode  scope.model.gridOptions           enableCellSelection true,         multiSelect false,         data model.tests,          columnDefs [              field field1, displayName Field 1, width 75px ,              field field2, displayName Field 2, width 150px, cellTemplate ltinput ngrequiredtrue min0  typenumber ngmodelCOLFIELD nginputCOLFIELDgt ,A              field field3, displayName Field 3, width 75px ,             More fields, a mix of input fields and labels       codepre  pstrongEDITstrong If I remove the tabindex via a user action, such as a button, I get the behaviour i expect i.e. not being able to focus the field, however another issue occurs where the tab button does not let you go past the first non focusable element.p  pI have a created a codeplunkrcode demonstrating this a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditc9Tzw7vnPebGhaH8HY9hppreview relnofollowissuea.p  pSo, the question now isp  pstrongDoes anyone know how I can disable the non input fields from being focusable and still allow the user to tab past the non focusable elementsstrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrong After looking a bit closer at the ngGrid code, it seems that codetabcode keydown events are captured by the grid and some special handling is attempted. I tried a few different things and managed to get some of the behaviour I wanted working however it ended up breaking the codeShift  Tabcode behaviourp

Negative 42676 pI just registered here and this is my very first question. I hope I can explain myself clearly cause being a selftaught developer I dont quite speak the jargon.p  pMy question my project database holds employee information and has things like firstName, lastName, jobTitle, etc.. static things. p  pMy problem begins when I want to also start collecting all the clockIn amp clockOut events of each employee. I cant think of an elegant way of adding these to my current database. p  pI dont know too much about databases but I think such things should either go in a totally different database or perhaps in a different table within the same database.  No idea which is the right answer. p  pThe other thing is that these 2 databases or 2 tables need to somehow relate to each other somehow. When I select an employee from the list [data coming from the 1st DB or Tbl] and choose to view that specific employees clock event history [data coming from the 2nd DB or Tbl] I should see that employees clock ins amp outs and NOT some other employees clock events history.p  pA stepbystep tutorial is not necessary, but appreciated. Can you give me a quick explanationoutline of how this can be done  If needed, I can add more details about  the project.p  pThanks.p

Negative 42676 pI am getting a latency that seems dependent on the computer, between AVFoundation and the simple [NSSound play]. My program is playing one video track and 3 audio tracks arranged inside an AVPlayer. This is working nicely.  Independently, the program generates a metronome for each beat of the measure, following information from the music score.  The two metronome sounds are very short files that I load in an NSSound and use [NSSound play] to play them.  I noticed that I had to shift the metronome playback of about 90 milliseconds so that it is perfectly synchronized.  Part of it may be the exact moment when the impact of the metronome is located in the metronome file, but if that was the only reason, then this delay would be the same on all Mac computers.  However, on different Macs, this delay must be adjusted.  As it is a metronome beat synchronized with the music, it is quite critical, as a slight shift makes it sound off beat.  Is there any way to calculate this delay directly from AVFoundation API   Or to compensate it or to play the metronome in another way so that there is no delay between the AVPlayer and the NSSound play   I would appreciate some link or idea about this. Thanks  Dominique Arpege Music, Belgiump

Negative 42676 pI have a table that contains the email addresses and products that each person has ordered.

The table is belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combWFsl.png altDatabase Imagep  pIve blurred the emails for obvious reasons, but as you can probably tell, those are the emails of only 2 customers whove purchased multiple products, some the same as others.  I need to grab a distinct email, loop through distinct purchases, add the past purchases to the email, send the email out and then ensure that its marked in some way so they dont get duplicate emails in the future.p  pWhat would be the best way to do what Im trying to do  Should I Iterate through the email addys and use a select to select distinct purchases and then send the email Then maybe add the email addresses to another table so I dont send it again, if so, what happens to a future customer who buys with the same email  I just need ideas, I can handle the code portion, just trying to find the easiest and most productive way to accomplish this task.p  pIm not sure if it matters but there are 12k records to sort through and this is an expressionengine site.

Negative 42676 pIm looking for a stable, fast dynamic image resizing service that works in a responsive, grid design. I run a website that features large numbers of photos displayed using a bootstrap grid. p  pId like to upload the images once at full resolution and then have them dynamically resized based on their display size in the grid. The images are displayed as 100 width and then constrained by the size of the bootstrap grid cell. Some are displayed side by side, some are displayed at full container width.p  pI currently use a hrefhttpReSRC.it relnofollowhttpReSRC.ita to resize and serve my images. I specify the URL once and JS on the client side requests the most appropriate sized image. Theyre the only service I can find that uses the images display size. The viewport size isnt relevant here because a smaller viewport may actually require a larger image if the grid collapses and the images are no longer displayed side by side.p  pIm not unhappy with ReSRC.it, Id just like to understand what other options I have especially when it comes to speedreliability  two of ReSRCs flaws, IMO. It would seem that CloudFlares Mirage feature appears to do something similar, but I cant find any information on whether it uses viewport or display is there a JS component size. I dont know whether CloudFlare astroturfs, but it seems as though any information that does exist on the service is the same marketing fluff repeated over and over again.p  pOther services Ive seen resize based on URL paramaters, but that doesnt help me as I dont know the size of the image until the client loads. That means Im pretty much limited to a semijavascript solution, rightp

Negative 42676 pHello everyone I have been trying to filter data for the First Match and Second Match that does not equal certain values so the best way I thought of doing this was to create an array of possible values for the field that you would want to filter out and then use a for loop to go through each possible value and filter the data accordingly and at the same time append the values so the previous filtered data will not be lost.p  precodePrivate Sub notEqualClick Dim strArray0 To 13 As String  strArray0  0 strArray1  2 strArray2  3 strArray3  4 strArray4  5 strArray5  6 strArray6  7 strArray7  8  strArray8  9 strArray9  10 strArray10  11 strArray11  12 strArray12  13 strArray13  14 For i  LBoundstrArray To UBoundstrArray txtF and txtL refers to the text box value If txtF ltgt 15 And txtF ltgt 1 Then  Me.Filter  [First Match]   amp strArrayi Me.Filter  Me.Filter amp strArrayi End If  If txtL ltgt 15 And txtL ltgt 1 Then Me.Filter  [Second Match]   amp strArrayi Me.Filter  Me.Filter amp strArrayi End If  Next   Me.FilterOn  True End Sub codepre  pI get an error that says syntax error missing operator in query expression First Match0.

Negative 42676 pAlright folks,p  pIm attempting to cut my teeth on ARM assembly, but I cant quite grasp the concept of interrupts. Prior to this, Ive worked with AVR interrupts, where code was written to explicitly link the interrupt vector to the subroutine or segment being jumped intop  precode.ORG 0022                           RJMP TIMERINTERRUPT codepre  pHowever, in working with the Atmel SAMA5D3 series, I cant figure out how to accomplish something similar. I understand that the first 8 interrupt vectors lie in the first 8 program counter addresses coderesetcode at code0x00code to codefiqcode at code0x1Ccode, but I havent been able to find a good, nononsense, easytounderstand resource on how the individual peripheral interrupts SPI, UART, TC modules map into the standardized ARM vector table.p  pThat is, suppose in the code I configure the UART to be able to throw interrupts. What occurs when it throws an interrupt Does the address for the codeirqcode entry code0x18code contain the location of a table of the devicespecific vectors How does the vendor and devicespecific peripherals assert interrupts via the corestandardized tablep  pIve consulted with the datasheet for the SAMA5D3 as well as the ARM ARM and I havent found much that makes it easier on the part of a beginner. My apologies if anything is unclear, and shame on the world for eschewing assembly.p  pEDITp  pFrom the a hrefhttpwww.atmel.comImagesAtmel1112132bitCortexA5MicrocontrollerSAMA5D3Datasheet.pdf relnofollowSAMA5D3 datasheet, page 118a, it states thatp  blockquote   pIt is assumed thatp      ol   liThe Advanced Interrupt Controller has been programmed, AICSVR registers are loaded with corresponding interrupt service routine addresses and interrupts are enabled.li   liThe instruction at the ARM interrupt exception vector address is required to work with the vectoringli   ol      pcodeLDR PC, [PC,  ampF20]codep      pWhen codenIRQcode is asserted, if the bit I of codeCPSRcode is 0, the sequence is as followsp      ol   liThe codeCPSRcode is stored in codeSPSRirqcode, the current value of the Program Counter is loaded in the Interrupt link register codeR14irqcode and the Program Counter codeR15code is loaded with 0x18. In the following cycle during fetch at address 0x1C, the ARM core adjusts codeR14irqcode, decrementing it by four.li   liThe ARM core enters Interrupt mode, if it has not already done so.li   liWhen the instruction loaded at address 0x18 is executed, the program counter is loaded with the value read in codeAICIVRcode.li   ol blockquote  pThis is understandable. From reading this plus looking at the register numbers, I put the peripheral interrupt source i.e. codeSPI01code number into the codeINTSELcode field of codeAICSSRcode, and then it sounds like I store the address of the ISR into codeAICSVRcode.p  pThere are two problems, one of which is that I dont understand the vectoring instruction codeLDR PC, [PC,  ampF20]code that needs to be present and compatible with the codeirqcode vector address at code0x18code. p  pThe other problem being, how does one enable multiple interrupts There is only one codeINTSELcode field and source vector register, so how would one run multiple interrupt handlers on this systemp  pMy continued apologies, folks, if Im not getting this, but I at least try to do my homework on it.p
Negative 42676 pI am currently creating a parser library, and for testing purposes I would like to be able to load one of several parsers while a main repl is running.  It reads commands and executes parsers, which can be exited by hitting CtrlD, like the shell.  How should I select the parser I want at runtime  Should Ip  ol liInclude all of the parsers I might use and run the one the user selects,li liLoad and unload the required parsers using a dynamic library system like dlfcn or a better alternative,li liForkexec a separate program for each parser, orli liNot use a main repl and just compile a repl into each parser and run them all separately.li ol  pI want my program to be cross platform so if I do 2 or 3 Ill need to use a sloppy function on windows and preferably memory and cpu light.

Every parser is expected to have a codestartcode function that parses some input and an codeexecutecode function that starts post processing interpreting, compiling, calculating, etc.  If I go with strategy 1 or 4, this is really all I need.  If I use 2 or 3, I will actually be able to load the parsers one at a time like I want to.  Which of these approaches should I use  Should I bother with only loading the parsers I use, or is it not worth it compared to loading them allp

Negative 42676 pHomework Problem An Internet service provider offers three subscription packages to its customers, plus a discount for nonprofit organizations a.

Thus, trying to affect order or execution within one statement, rather than use more than one statement, wouldnt be helpful, at least for what I was trying to accomplish. There is one trick listed below using CTEs that will work  but as noted by harmic in the comments, it might not work in future versions of postgres, and could introduce hardtofind sporadic errors if this happens.... Im not convinced that it would never be useful to control execution order, but Craigs advice to make sure you have a good reason before trying is certainly good.p

Negative 42676 pIve never contributed to SciPy or any other Python package, for that matter, but I have a super simple code that performs a 2D discrete cosine transform using existing SciPy code for the 1D discrete cosine transform. SciPy already has support for the 2D or N dimensional fast fourier transform, but not for the 2D discrete cosine transform. Looking at the SciPy code on GitHub, I see that most of the fourierrelated code everything in the fftpack module is written in fortran, while the code Ive put together is in Python put together is an overstatement  its one line.p  pMy question is this I see this code as being pretty useful, and perhaps represents a good opportunity for me to contribute to SciPy.

Negative 42676 pI want to create a system where a user does sign in to my website and then gets a link to download apk for my android app.  Inside the app there is a final string containing username by which the server recognises the app. For this purpose I want my server to compile a fresh apk with the username inside for each user. I have no idea how to achieve this please help.p  pedit basically the problem comes down to this, is there any way to compress certain file into .rar programmatically . And which language should i use for this. p

Negative 42676 pI have this vba sub that is designed to replace cell hyperlinks with the HYPERLINK function. However, the currentCell.Hyperlinks.Delete line causes all cell formatting to be reset font, font size, bolding, underlining, cell borders, alignment, etc.. Is there any way to prevent it from doing this other than manually copying each cell property and then resetting the property after deleting the Hyperlinks Also, it looks like setting the cell formula also resets the font, but if that is the only property that gets messed up, I can handle it.p  precodeSub Test  Dim currentCell As Range Dim directoryBase As String  directoryBase  examplePath  For Each currentCell In Worksheets2.UsedRange.Cells      If currentCell.Hyperlinks.Count gt 0 Then         currentCell.Formula  HYPERLINK  directoryBase  currentCell.Hyperlinks1.Address  ,         currentCell.Hyperlinks.Delete         Debug.Print currentCell.Address     End If   Next currentCell  End Sub codepre  pThanksp

Negative 42676 pI have an Outlook addin where I need to display a ribbon in the main Outlook window and in the Mail Read window as well. To do this I have added two ribbon xml files with the right markups in them. I then added a C class that implements the Office.IRibbonExtensibility interface where I have implemented the GetCustomUI method which returns the right XML. Finally I did this in the ThisAddIn.cs classp  precodeprotected override Office.IRibbonExtensibility CreateRibbonExtensibilityObject                      try                                ribbon  new Ribbon                 return ribbon                          catch Exception e                                        return null          codepre  pSo far so good. The ribbons load and everything shows in correct place.p  pNow the problem is that this Ribbon.cs file is getting rather huge as all the callbacks live in this file. Is there a way to split the callbacks into multiple classes So if I have a Ribbon1.xml and RIbbon2.xml can I have equivalent Ribbon1.cs and Ribbon2.csp

Negative 42676 pIm creating an MVC 5 site with Web API 2 functionality inside it as well and Im wondering how I should work with the fact that ASP.NET uses 2 different resolver instances for resolving MVC controllers and ApiControllers.  p  pI found a hrefhttpwww.devtrends.co.ukblogusingunity.mvc5andunity.webapitogetherinaproject relnofollowthis articlea that explains how to configure the resolution, but it looks like it uses 2 separate container instances and doesnt explain how to register dependencies for each. Its just like do your registration here.p  pFollowing the 2container example, I was tempted to set up the app so that the Web API container only has Web API dependencies and the MVC container only has mvc controller dependencies, but I feel like in the situation where a component is used for both, having a subset of items used in both containers would be too much work to maintain correctly.p  pIs it okay to just have all of the dependencies installed in each container Or is it better to use the same container in each resolverp  pEdit Im not using Unity so Im writing a resolver class to wrap Windsor. Im considering having my resolver implement both interfaces and just assigning the same instance as the different resolvers as well.p

Negative 42676 pI am trying to connect Analog Devices ADV7182 video encoder chip to a miniPC board NanoPC for quite a long time, but still has got no video data.p  pADV7182 has I2C communication and MIPICSI2 video interface and there is a driver for it made for kernel 3.15.x. The driver is taken from here a hrefhttpsgithub.comanalogdevicesinclinuxtreeadv7280 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comanalogdevicesinclinuxtreeadv7280ap  pInitially, the issue is that NanoPC uses older kernel version 3.8.x and I unsuccessfully tried to upgrade it, but it went way deeper to change bootloader either as it could not understand newer kernel image so after several attempts I stopped.p  pSo I tried to change the driver. The difference is in v4l2, that does not support async devices registering in older versions including 3.8.x that I have.

The problem arises when the dataset is quite big like this and plyr doesnt work very well with them ... and the alternative dplyr package is not compatible with list results... oh well.p

Negative 42676 pMy Pi and PC are connected to the same router. PC is dhcp while Pi is static static defined at etcnetworkinterfaces of Pi and not IP reserve at router side. PC can ping Pi 100 success while Pi ping PC only success for a few seconds after boot. If I ping PC after these few seconds, ping reported unreadable. To connect for Netbeans remote host or SSH, I have to first ping Pi from PC a few times, then try to ping PC from Pi continuously until success. Then keep on pinging from Pi to PC at 10 second interval. If I change the interval to 15 second, the connection will lose soon. Same problem happens with wired or wifi connection from Pi.p  pThis may be a timeout problem in Pi, but how can I set the timeout to longer time Or is it a timeout problem The inactivity time seems to be just a few seconds which doesnt look like a normal timeout setting.p

How can I leverage this option and the clientip attribute on the index to show counts on the world map After I saw the first two answers below. Before I push the data to ES, I looked up GeoPoint [lon, lat] with client ip. In Kibana 3.1.2 I created a bettermap and pointed it to this geo field. Curling the request behind this bettermap returns a lot of data back. their geoPoints look good. However BetterMap doesnt return anything back. Anything reason why Thank youp

Negative 42676 pIn essence, what is the difference between these two classesp  precodeApplicationScoped Singleton class A   Dependent Singleton class B  codepre  h2Contextual EJB instancesh2  pI prefer not to use a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxinjectInject.html relnofollowInjecta when looking for EJBs, unless the EJB is a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxejbStateful.html relnofollowStatefula and I want the CDI container to manage the statefuls lifecycle which could be very convenient. Otherwise, using Inject to retrieve a contextual EJB instance is a bit dangerous. For example, a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxejbRemote.html relnofollowRemotea clientview cannot be retrieved using CDI unless we also write a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7apijavaxenterpriseinjectProduces.html relnofollowproducera. Furthermore, class A and class B can not declare any other scope than what they currently do. a hrefhttpjcp.orgaboutJavacommunityprocessfinaljsr346index.html relnofollowCDI 1.1a, section 3.2 Session beans saysp  blockquote   pA singleton bean must belong to either the ApplicationScoped scope or   to the Dependent pseudoscope. If a session bean specifies an illegal   scope, the container automatically detects the problem and treats it   as a definition error.p blockquote  pHence, apart from stateful beans, I see no point in using CDI when I go look for EJBs.p  h2A more mature version of the questionh2  pFrom the client codes perspective which uses Inject to declare a dependency on either A or B, I cannot imagine there is a difference. In both cases, the call strongwillstrong be routed to a singleton EJB. Had I been the implementation author of a CDI provider, then I might even inject the real EJB proxy in both cases and ignore future calls asking for destruction of the dependent CDI proxy The bottom line is that we may declare two different scopes on the EJB singleton class. So whats the differencep

Since normally a dialog is created and displayed from outside an activity, so a flick solution could be to create a transparent activity which embedded the dialog in it. By doing so, I could easily start a dialog when user click the button on my softkeyboard.p  pBut one tricky problem is every time user click the button and the dialog actually a dialog in a transparent activity displays, it will always make my softkeyboard hide.

Negative 42676 pI am pretty new to angularjs. Love it but sometimes get surprises that I just cant find an answer.p  pI have a function that lets the user build a list to a file by clicking a link.

But when 2 are build at the same time the second POST is cancelled it arrives in the error callback once the popup of the first appears.p  pIf I remove window.open both POST are finished succesfully and I get both fileIds in the console log.p  pClearly the problem lies with window.open.

To do thisp  pI used iconv command p  blockquote   piconv c t UTF8 lt new.xml  newnews.xmlp blockquote  pthen used diff command to see the differencep  blockquote   pdiff new.xml newnews.xmlp blockquote  pBut there is no difference between them. Hence I get the same error given the newnews.xml to xsltproc command.p  pCould you please help me to solve this What am I doing wrong  By the way I am using OsX terminal. I dont know if iconv command makes difference as in the sed and awk commands.p  pBest Regardsp

Negative 42676 pI have a frustrating problem that only manifests itself when plotting filled contour plots on 3D axes and only in certain situations.p  pHere is an example of the issue I am experiencingp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comUnC1b.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUnC1b.png altenter image description hereap  pandp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comjhrqc.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjhrqc.png altenter image description hereap  pThese are the same data at different contouring intervals. Youll notice on the left side of the domain there is misfilling occurring.  This is a plot with the Z points squished into the Z0 plane, via a plotting command likep  precodeax3d.contourfX, Y, dbz[z25,,], zdirz, offset0, levelslevels, cmappymeteoradar, alpha0.50 codepre  pThe miscontouring happens regardless of alpha level or colormap used, but is sensitive to the number of levels.  The use of codezdircode and codeoffsetcode do not effect the miscontouring the artifact just occurs on the Z surface.  If I do not fill the contour, there is no miscontouring.  I can also alter the domain to sometimes make the issue better or worse, but I have many plots to make within the same domain so that is not a fix.p  pThis issue does not occur when the same data is plotted on 2D axes, e.g.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comtRfkI.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtRfkI.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThis plot has some extra data on it, but you can see that the filled contouring does not have the same artifact from misfilling the contour that occurs on the 3d axes.p  pBelow is a script you can run to reproduce the issue.  p  precodeusrbinenv

For example, I am in cygdrivec and typep  precode cd Pro codepre  ppressing Tab key completes to cd Program, pressing twice shows all directories with this Program prefixp  precodeProgram Files       Program Files x86 ProgramData codepre  pI want to cd to Program Files so I typep  precode cd Program  codepre  pwith space after backslash and from now on pressing Tab does nothing. It used to work some time ago but I cannot identify when exactly it stopped. Any hints on what can be the cause of thisp

Negative 42676 pI am taking a course on web development and I havent been getting any help on how to set up Sublime Text 3 with a local server. I am being taught by some foreigners who can hardly speak English, so when I ask them, they dont really know how to explain it to me. Videos online havent helped. p  pThey want me to use Eclipse with Apache Tomcat, which I have set up, but I would like to use Sublime Text 3 instead of Eclipse, because I like it much better. I read something about MAMP, but again, I would need help setting it up. If anyone could point me in the right direction or give me a breakdown of what I need to do. My current assignments are with using AJAX amp JSON... and then AngularJS. So I need to basically be able to retrieve items from a JSON file and insert them in my HTML, from a local server.

Negative 42676 pIve got an iOS app backed with ejabberd, with a small extension based on offlinemessagehook that uses APNS Apple Push Notification Service to deliver push notifications of messages that are sent to offline users.

Negative 42676 pIm trying to implement a setbased solution for a problem and have been running into some issues. p  pThe problem is I have 2 sets of codeGroupcode objects. These sets should be unique on codeemailcode so we can check if an object from one set is codeincode the other set.p  pHowever, two codeGroupcode objects are not codeeqcode if they only have an email match for example, one set may contain an updated codeGroupcode object that has a new codedescriptioncode. The goal is to have a set where I can perform set operations intersection and difference based only on the codeemailcode field... then check equality based on other fields codedescriptioncode and codenamecodep  precode    class Group         def initself, name, email, description             self.name  name             self.email  email             self.description  description          def hashself             return hashself.email          def eqself, other             return self.email  other.email                      and self.description  other.description                      and self.name  other.name          def neself, other             return not self.eqother          def strself             return Description 0 Email 1 Name 2.formatself.description, self.email, self.name codepre  pSo id expect all assert statements to pass herep  precode    group1  Groupfirst test group, testingexample.com, example description     group2  Groupsecond test group, realexample.com, example description     group3  Groupthird group, testingexample.com, example description     group5  Groupupdated name, testingexample.com, example description      groupset  set[group1, group2, group3]     groupset2  set[group3, group5]      self.assertTruegroup5 in groupset.intersectiongroupset2     self.assertEqual2, lengroupset     self.assertTruegroup5 in groupset codepre
