Negative 9568 pWhen creating a new list do you specify an initial size or leave it blank I know by specifying an initial size you avoid having the list reallocate the underlying array everytime you add x number of items but you also add verbosity to your code.

What happens when that list needs one more item and you forget to add one to the initialization you still suffer from the performance overhead of reallocation and now the number may not make sense to new developers.p

Over many VS20058 projects, Ive never had a problem with CodeBehind, until this Intellisense issue showed up...  though it doesnt help that in this case Im deploying to SharePoint, which introduces a whole new level of complexity.p  pSince Ive not deployed using CodeFile before, its very likely that Im missing some option Im supposed to set in VS when building, in order to force a precompile.  I just need to be able to deploy, as I do today, as a set of ASPXASCX with a single codebehind DLL.  And thats working today with CodeBehind ... it just has the originally mentioned Intellisense problem, which is really what I want to fix p  pWill post more as I identify what files might be relevant to the question...p
Negative 9568 pIf i have an ArrayList of type Integer, containing numbers like 1,3,4,9,10 etc...

Negative 9568 pI have two console apps, Query and Update, that share some functionality.  I wanted to have the two classes inherit from a common base class, but the problem is that, for a console app, I have to have a codestatic Maincode function.  What I currently have is the followingp  precodenamespace Utils      public class ConsoleBase              protected const int ERROREXITCODE  1         protected static void printWarningstring msg ...         public ConsoleBaseIEnumerableltstringgt args  ...  ...  namespace Update      class Update  ConsoleBase              private static ConsoleBase consoleBase         public static void Mainstring[] args  ...  ...  namespace Query      class Query  ConsoleBase              private static ConsoleBase consoleBase         public static void Mainstring[] args  ...  ... codepre  pIt seems like a design problem for me to both inherit from codeConsoleBasecode as well as have an instance of it as a codestaticcode variable within each derived class.  The reason Im doing this is so thatp  ol liI can have codeprotected staticcode methods defined in codeConsoleBasecode that are accessible to other codestaticcode methods in the derived classes.li liI can pass along commandline arguments to the constructor for codeConsoleBasecode, do common stuff, and then access the arguments again in the derived classes via codepubliccode properties and methods on the instance of codeConsoleBasecode.li ol  pSo in the derived classes, I have a mixture of calls to methodsproperties on the instance of codeConsoleBasecode, e.g.p  precodeconsoleBase.UseDebugMode codepre  pAs well as calling inherited static methods and accessing inherited constants that are defined in codeConsoleBasecode, e.g.p  precodeprintWarningCONSTMSGINBASECLASS codepre  pCan I clean this up somehow  Is it bad to both inherit from a class as well as keep an instance of that base class around for working withp

Negative 9568 pIs there a way to include some aspxascx markup in a DLL and use that to generate text dynamically  I really just want to pass a model instance to a view and get the produced html as a string.  Similar to what you might do with an XSLT transform, except the transform input is a CLR object rather than an XML document.  A second benefit is using the ASP.NET codebehind markup which is known by most team members.p  pOne way to achieve this would be to load the MVC view engine inprocess and perhaps have it use an ASPX file from a resource.  It seems like I could call into just the ViewEngine somehow and have it generate a ViewEngineResult.  I dont know ASP.NET MVC well enough though to know what calls to make.p  pI dont think this would be possible with classic ASP or ASP.NET as the control model is so tied to the page model, which doesnt exist in this case.  p  pUsing something like SparkViewEngine in isolation would be cool too, though not as useful since other team members wouldnt know the syntax.  At that point I might as well use XSLT yes I am looking for a clever way to avoid XSLT.p

For example, take the below code p  precodepublic partial class MyClass  System.Web.UI.Page      private UserProfile profile     private SessionManagerltUserProfilegt session      protected void PagePreInitobject sender, EventArgs e              session  new SessionManagerltUserProfilegt10           protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e               string UserName  sessionManager[profile.SessionId].UserName          profile  UserProfile.GetUserProfileUserName        codepre  pIn the above code I need to pass the users UserName to  to the GetUserProfile method in order to create an instance  of the authenticated users profile. But, I need to have the profile object to access the SessionId. Sort of  a Catch 22. What am I doing wrong here How should I be accessing session and profile information for each new page the user  visitsp  p2 the importance of the database when using sessions p  pMy second question relates to the use of the DB with sessions.  In Stefans class, all session information is stored in a session  object that persists as long as the user is authenticated. But,  in other online reading, I have seen examples where programmers  store session keys in a table in association with fkprofileid.  What is the purpose of this What is the best practice  p  pThanks for your time.p
Negative 9568 pThis is sort of a continuation of one of my earlier posts, which involves the resolving of modules in my WPF application.  This question is specifically related to the effect of interdependencies of modules and the method of constructing those modules i.e. via MEF or through codenewcode on MEFs ability to resolve relationships.p  pI have tried two approachesp  ul lileft approach the App implements IErrorli liright approach the App has a member that implements IErrorli ul  pemLeft approachemp  pMy code behind looked like this just the MEFrelated stuffp  precode app.cs [ExporttypeofIError] public partial class Window1  Window, IError      [Import]     public CandyCo.Shared.LibraryInterfaces.IPlugin Plugin  get set      [Import]     public CandyCo.Shared.LibraryInterfaces.ICandySettings Settings  get set       private ICandySettings Settings      public Window1               I create the preferences here with new, instead of using MEF.  I wonder          if thats my whole problem  If I use MEF, and want to have parameters          going to the constructor, then do I have to [Export] a POCO i.e. string         Settings  new CandySettings Settings, csettings.xml          var catalog  new DirectoryCatalog .         var container  new CompositionContainer catalog         try              container.ComposeParts this          catch CompositionException ex              foreach CompositionError e in ex.Errors                  string description  e.Description                 string details  e.Exception.Message                          throw                  plugin.cs [ExporttypeofIPlugin] public class Plugin  IPlugin      [Import]     public CandyCo.Shared.LibraryInterfaces.ICandySettings CandySettings  get set      [Import]     public CandyCo.Shared.LibraryInterfaces.IError ErrorInterface  get set       [ImportingConstructor]     public Plugin ICandySettings candysettings, IError errorinterface              CandySettings  candysettings         ErrorInterface  errorinterface         candysettings.cs [ExporttypeofICandySettings] public class CandySettings  ICandySettings      ...  codepre  pemRightside approachemp  pBasically the same as the leftside approach, except that I created a class that inherits from IError in the same assembly as Window1.  I then used an [Import] to try to get MEF to resolve that for me.p  pCan anyone explain how the two ways I have approached MEF here are flawed  I have been in the dark for so long that instead of reading about MEF and trying different suggestions, Ive added MEF to my solution and am stepping into the code.  The part where it looks like it fails is when it calls codepartManager.GetSavedImportcode.  For some reason, the importCache is null, which I dont understand.  All the way up to this point, its been looking at the part Window1 and trying to resolve two imported interfaces  IError and IPlugin.  I would have expected it to enter code that looks at other assemblies in the same executable folder, and then check it for exports so that it knows how to resolve the imports...p  pI had found a mistake in my code, and when I fixed it, the MEF exception changed, and was also more useful.  It clearly pointed out that it couldnt find a CandySettings default constructor  And digging more, I found a a hrefhttpcodebetter.comblogsglenn.blockarchive20090321recompositionandconstructors.aspx relnofollowgood post from Glenn Blocka that discusses this.  So I need to finish reading it and see if his workaround will do the trick or not.  I would still appreciate more answers, since theres no telling if the workaround is the right thing to do or not.p

Negative 9568 pIm making an addin with Visual Studio 2005 C to help easily toggle between source and header files, as well as script files that all follow a similar naming structure.  However, the directory structure has all of the files in different places, even though they are all in the same project. p  pIve got almost all the pieces in place, but I cant figure out how to find and open a file in the solution based only on the file name alone.  So I know Im coming from, say,  ccodeprojectsubprojectsrcblah.cpp, and I want to open ccodeprojectsubprojectincblah.h, but I dont necessarily know where blah.h is.  I could hardcode different directory paths but then the utility isnt generic enough to be robust. p  pThe solution has multiple projects, which seems to be a bit of a pain as well.  Im thinking at this point that Ill have to iterate through every project, and iterate through every project item, to see if the particular file is there, and then get a proper reference to it.p  pBut it seems to me there must be an easier way of doing this.p

Negative 9568 pIm not sure if this is a bug or Im just missing something although I have already parsed the documentation about inlines, butp  pLets say I have a model A. Model A is an inline of model B.

Kind of a stupid doctrine.p  pRight now, Im trying to simulate this view only permissions by leaving U with just change rights and set all fields as read only. But I think this is kind of a stupid approach and may also cause problems like the permissions thing above...p  pHow does an average Django programmer like me achieve viewonly permissions, and most of all how should I get rid of the Add another A link at the bottom of the admin edit formp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 9568 pI have some forms that were created with Acrobat, they are fillable PDF files they contain named fields.  Is there a toolkit that will reformat them into TEXLaTEX files and leave all the fields intact  With Acrobat, I can export the forms to Word format havent tried it yet, so that might be another path I can take as well.  So maybe Word  TEX would be acceptable.p  pI know the two beasts are not identical, the fields in a TEX file are just defs at the top of the file, but Id like to get some of the benefits of TEX fields that need to grow and expand to cover multiple pages without having to reauthor the forms that have already been created in acrobat.p

Negative 9568 pOSGi seems to have an excellent benefit of having small deployable artifacts by not wrapping dozens of JAR dependencies into a lib directory. However, I cant find anything that tells me an easy, reliable way to deploy dependencies to a container. For instance, I have an application that uses CXF and several Spring subprojects. If I need to deploy this application to a new Glassfish server, what would be the best way to do so, ensuring that all dependencies get installed p  pIm using Maven, and it would emseemem that there could be some way to have a hook that looks at the METAINFmaven directory and pulls the dependency list from the pom.xml and goes and fetches the required libs probably from a local repo.

A new trigger chain is being initiated. The trigger wants to be a terminator and set the stop flag up.

Negative 9568 pHi there at strongSOstrong,p  pI would like some ideascomments on the following from you honorable and venerable bunch.p  pI have a 100M records which I need to process.  I have 5 nodes in a rocks cluster to do this.  The data is very structured and falls nicely in the relational data model.  I want to do things in parallel since my processing takes some time.p  pAs I see it I have two main optionsp  pInstall mysql on each node and put 20M records on each.  Use the head node to delegate queries to the nodes and aggregate the results.  strongQuery Capabilitiesstrong, but I might risk some headaches when I come to choose partitioning strategies etc.  Q. Is this what they call mysqlpostgres cluster.  The really bad part is that the processing of the records is left up to me now to take care of how to distribute across machines etc...p  pAlternatively install Hadoop, Hive and HBase note that this might not be the most efficient way to store my data, since HBase is column oriented and just define the nodes.  We write everything in the MapReduce paradigm and, bang, we live happily ever after. The problem here is that we loose the real time query capabilities I know you can use Hive, but that is not suggested for real time queries  which I need  since I also have some normal sql queries to execute at times select  from wine where colour  brown.p  pNote that in theory  if I had 100M machines I could do the whole thing instantly since for each record the processing is independent of the other. Also  my data is readonly.  I do not envisage any updates happening.  I do not needwant 100M records on one node.  I do not want there to be redundant data since there is lots of it so keeping it in BOTH mysqlpostgres and HadoopHBaseHDFS. is not a real option.p  pMany Thanksp

Negative 9568 pWe have a C.Net addin developed for Excel 2003. It has a WIX installer that I created by decompiling dark.exe an installer that someone else made using nowunavailable technology, and fixing up any problems.p  pIt is possible, but tricky, to persuade Excel 2007 to accept our addin. Once persuaded that it is actually an addin, it works fine in Excel 2007. But to be considered suitable for release, a oneclick installer, like we have for Excel 2003, would be needed for Excel 2007.p  pCan anyone suggest any quickish way that I can make an installer to install the addin to Excel 2007 properlyp  pIn answering, please bear in mind that, while I am an experienced programmer with plenty of C experience, I am almost illiterate on WIX and only know a modest amount about VSTO this addin is the only one Ive worked on.p
Negative 9568 pI have been working in some C language function that is going to be called from a  Progress 4GL application and I found myself with the following doubtsp  pThe C function uses malloc to dynamically allocate an array of chars and the idea is that the pointer that allocates that memory will be returned to the Progress 4GL process which originally sent a MEMPTR data type to hold the result of the C method. p  pBasically the MEMPTR from Progress must be sent to the C function to receive the C generated array and use it when scope returns to it from de C function a pass by reference between both languages where the C method fills the MEMPTR progress variable.p  pMy questions is p  pWhen the Progress process finishes and the MEMPTR variable is freed, does it free the malloc allocated memory in the C function as wellp  pand p  pIf I free the malloc allocated memory in the C function Im guessing the Progress process will receive garbage data, Is this correct p  pThanks for your time and help.p  pGreetings.p

To take that farther what if Jane also had the Title of SEO where as John had the title of Music and Jane and John had the title of Web Development and both had the same URL how could more intertwined mark ups like this be represented without listing all the info for each person separatelyp  p4.

Negative 9568 pAs a guideline I prefer apply functions on elements of a list using lapply or ply from plyr rather than explicitly iterating through them. However, this works well when I have to process one list at a time. When the function takes multiple arguments, I usually do a cycle. p  pI was wondering if its possible to have a cleaner construct, still functional in nature. One possible approach could be to define a function similar to Python, zipx,y, which takes the input lists, and returns a list, whose ith element is listx, y, and then apply the function to this list. But my question is whether I am using the cleanest approach or not.

Negative 9568 pI have built a CSS layout for a page that appears to work in tested browsers thus far and has previously validated CSS and HTML.p  pRandomly though, the layout breaks and codedivcodes move as if they lost their floats. The breaks occur in Firefox 4 and IE8 for sure so its not browser specific. There have been at times four codedivcodes that have moved but at other times only one 8212 so it doesnt break the same way every time. The breaks typically happen after a period of time away from the site and are fixed with either one or two refreshes. The breaks cannot be triggered with an empty cachecleared browser history. The breaks happen whether the header is on the actual page or as an include. The breaks happen probably one time out of 20 8212 but it really seems like its more about the time passed between page loads than about anything else. I am not understanding how this could purely be a cache issue since I cannot recreate the issue when I delete the cache.p  pOriginally, another forum answer said that it was the use of fontface but today I saw the layout break in IE8 and Firefox with the 2 fontface fonts loaded....so it is only the layout that broke while the fonts loaded.  So I am not sure if that is the issue.  The layout is built to work even if the fontface does not load.p  pHere is the link to the site that breaks  a hrefhttprg.isolatedfilmproductions.com relnofollowhttprg.isolatedfilmproductions.coma.

A key advantage of option 2, which requires all API endpoints to be HTTPS URLs, is that its considerably simpler.  I believe the simplicity of this approach is one of the main reasons that its the default in OAuth 2.0.p  pBut its only simpler if accessing HTTPS URLs is not an obstacle for the client software.  Which is why Im wondering strongwhat sorts of clients will find it unfeasible to use an API that forces HTTPS on themstrongp  pI know of one HTTP web pages that want to connect to a JSON API using JavaScript running in the browser.  They cant access any HTTPS URLs without triggering browser security warnings about mixed content.p  pBut Im sure there must be other problem clients or programming platforms.  Maybe old versions of PHP, or shared hosts, embedded devices, old Win32 apps, some sorts of enterprise middleware software etc.  Just some possible ideas.

Negative 9568 pI am developing a Ruby On Rails App for collecting data from users for products via web forms. A database table contains all the ProductTypes, another table contains ProductAttributes, and ProductTypesProductAttributes is a relationship table mapping the attributes that are assigned to certain product types. The data collected for each specific product is then stored in a Products table with a columnfield for each attribute  which may be empty if that attribute is not relevant to the product.p  pI want to add a feature to allow Administrator users to add new ProductAttributes to the system and then assign them to certain ProductTypes. No problem except when it comes to persisting the specific products collected. This will require dynamically adding a new attribute field to the Products table at runtime. This is where Im a little stumped as the best way to do this...p  p1 Store the products in an XML doc... This will save having a bunch of empty fields in the DB for attributes that dont belong to the ProductType for that product, and means new attribute types can be saved no problems. Im a little weary of storing data in XML files though, Ive always regarded them as a means to transmit and move data, not store it.p  p2 Continue to use a RDBMS, but include a BLOB field to store the attributes which can be dynamic for a product in XML, while traditional fields remain for the product code, description etc etc.p  p3 Finally, is there a RDBMS solution for the above Ive seen some discussion about MongoDB but Ill admit Im really not familiar with it having a background in more traditional DBs.p  pWas wondering if anyone has any experience and tips regarding this they would like to pass on Id like something that integrates with Ruby on Rails, and allows dynamic adding of persistence fields without requiring any code changes when a field is added to the DB tablep  pCheers,p  pStevep

Negative 9568 pIm writing an online tax return filing application using MVC3 and EF 4.1.  Part of the application requires that the taxpayer be able to upload documents associated with their return.  The users will be able to come back days or weeks later and possibly upload additional documents.  Prior to finally submitting their return the user is able to view a list of files that have been uploaded.  Ive written the application to save the uploaded files to a directory defined in the web.config.  When I display the review page to the user I loop through the files in the directory and display it as a list.p  pIm now thinking that I should be saving the files to the actual SQL Server as binary data in addition to saving them to the directory.

However, bc there are 1000 different active subscriptions, a subscriber might still be notified of 100 messages per day, and they should be able to reply aka post content to any one of those feeds.p  pIt seems like what I need is a pubsubmultiuserchat hybrid.  But that doesnt exist, or does it  Any ideas or pointersp  pThanks a bunchp

Negative 9568 pFirst of all, Im not a FED I concentrate on architecture and back end code so my JQuery isnt as good as it could be. If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code, it would be welcome.p  pIm using the uploadify jQuery plugin to upload images to my website. Ive built the site using ASP.Net MVC3, and Im using complex types for the forms with editor templates. Basically, my structure allows me to output an enumeration of objects, and each object has an uploadify control, which allows for multiple files to be uploaded. I can show you this code if you need to see it, but basically Ive implemented a more advanced version of Phil Haacks codeIEnumerableltHttpPostedFileBasegtcode example a hrefhttphaacked.comarchive20100716uploadingfileswithaspnetmvc.aspx relnofollowherea.p  pI have added code to the onComplete event to output a few additional form fields that allows me to add captions to each file uploaded, which are subsequently automagically bound to the correct objects by MVC. All of this works fine, although Im sure there are better ways to do it.p  pThe issue I face is that because MVC3 requires a zerobased, sequential index in the naming conventions for the enumerable form fields in order for an IEnumerable to be accepted by an action method. When I remove one of the dynamically created form controls with the cancel button, the index sequence is broken.p  pNow  because there are multiple uploadify elements, each one needs to maintain its own index. I would like to be able to extend each instance of the uploadify plugin to have a trackable fileIndex attribute, and also extend it with a reindexFiles method that will loop through all remaining controls and rename amp reid them.p  pMy methods may be crude comments welcome, but heres my code I have so farp  precodedocument.readyfunction       var uploadedIndex  0      div[idUploadedImages].uploadify         script ControlPanelMediaUploadRelatedImages,         auto true,         fileDesc Image Files .jpg.jpeg.gif.png,         fileExt .jpg.jpeg.gif.png,         buttonText Select Images,         fileDataName files,         multi true,         removeCompleted false,         simUploadLimit 3,         queueSizeLimit 100,         sizeLimit 1048576,  1Mb max limit         onSelectOnce function event, data              var uploader    event.delegateTarget.id             var mediaFormatID  uploader.closest.mediaFormat.childreninput[typehidden][nameMediaFormatID].first.val              var sd                   ASPSESSID ASPSESSID.val,                 AUTHID AUTHID.val,                 mediaFormatID mediaFormatID  The first grandparent that ends with MediaFormatID, for the hidden field                          uploader.uploadifySettingsscriptData, sd              TODO  The index needs to be managed per instance              Reset index this will reset each time a group of images are uploaded             uploadedIndex  0         ,         onComplete function event, ID, fileObj, response, data               Get the json response             var json  .parseJSONresponse[0]               Get the newly created queue item             var queueItem    event.delegateTarget.id  ID              if json.HasError                   Text error in response  show it and highlight                 queueItem.children.percentage.htmlltbrgt  json.ErrorMessage                 queueItem.addClassuploadifyError                 return false                           var textBoxId  event.delegateTarget.id    uploadedIndex  Caption             var textBoxName  event.delegateTarget.attributes[name].value  [  uploadedIndex  ].Caption              var hiddenId  event.delegateTarget.id    uploadedIndex  MediaFormatImageID             var hiddenName  event.delegateTarget.attributes[name].value  [  uploadedIndex  ].MediaFormatImageID               Create container             var container  ltdivgt.addClasscaptionContainer               Create bound hidden field             ltinput gt,                  type hidden,                 id hiddenId,                 name hiddenName,                 value json.MediaFormatImageID             .appendTocontainer               Display the image thumb             ltimggt,                  src json.ThumbnailPath             .appendTocontainer               Create Textbox label             ltlabel gt,                  for textBoxId             .textImage Caption                 .appendTocontainer               Create bound text box             ltinput gt,                  type text,                 id textBoxId,                 name textBoxName,                 maxlength 100             .appendTocontainer               Append container to queue item             container.appendToqueueItem               Increment index             uploadedIndex         ,         onCancel function event, ID, fileObj, data               Delete the file from the server             var uploader    event.delegateTarget.id              Get image ID from created hidden input             var hiddenId  event.delegateTarget.id    uploadedIndex  MediaFormatImageID             var hidden    hiddenId              .ajax                 url ControlPanelMediaDeleteRelatedImage,                 type POST,                 context uploader,                 data                      mediaFormatImageID hidden.val                 ,                 success function                        TODO Reindex form images                                               codepre  pThe onCancel method is incomplete and untested.

Negative 9568 pI am crating a view to display records with contract dates in them.p  pThe data for this view comes from two tables, one which stores the client details and another which stores the date info.p  pThe dates themeselves are stored in the DateCol column and the ID for the DateCol column comes from TypeID eg 118 equals a Contract Start Date and 119 equals an End date. This returns about 250 results.p  pThe view I have built runs a lookup against the client id and shows the date from the datetypeie 118 and 119 shows 01012012 and 01032012.

Negative 9568 pI would like to stream some files in and out of cassandra since we already use it rather than setting up a full hadoop distributed filesystem.

Does Hector or astyanax support thisp  pIt looks like astyanax supports a query callback so I think I can get with the primary keys to stream the file back with astyanaxp  pthanks, Dean p

Negative 9568 pI am used to using cancan in my rails views to showhide visual elements depending on the users permissions.  eg showing a Add New Post link to users that are allowed to add new posts.p  pIn a backbone app, where I am sending the entire app to the client at the beginning, how can I ensure that these elements are shown.  Obviously I can hide them based on a attribute on a user model.  But it would be possible to override this attribute on the client side.p  pJust wondering what others are doing to secure their apps from people messing with the js on the client.   Or am I being too secure being that there wouldnt be any data sent to the client as the authorisation is still working right on the server.p

Negative 9568 pIm trying to parallelize a pretty massive codeforloopcode in OpenMP.

Where I call other functions, theyre only changing private variables although occasionally reading shared variables so Id assume theyd be thread safe as theyre only messing with stuff local to a specific thread The only writing to any shared variables happens right at the end, where we write various calculated values to some shared arrays, where array elements are indexed by the forloop index. This code is in C, although the code it calls is both C and C code.p  pIve been trying to identify the source of the problem, but no luck so far. If I set numtheads1 it runs fine, as it does if I enclose the contents of the codeforloopcode in a single p  precodepragma omp for forindex  0  index lt end  index     pragma omp criticalwholeloop            loop body     codepre  pwhich presumably gives the same effect i.e. only one thread can pass through the loop at any one time.p  pIf, on the other hand, I enclose the codeforloopscode contents in two codecriticalcode directives e.g.p  precodepragma omp for forindex  0  index lt end  index     pragma omp criticalwholeloop            first half of loop body      pragma omp criticalwholeloop2            second half of loop body      codepre  pI get the unpredictable segfaulting. Similarly, if I enclose EVERY function call in a codecriticalcode directive it still doesnt work.p  pThe reason I think the problem may be linked to a function call is because when I profile with a hrefhttpvalgrind.org relnofollowValgrinda using codevalgrind tooldrd checkstackvaryes readvarinfoyes .executecode as well as SIGSEGing I get an eminsaneem number of load and store errors, such asp  precodeConflicting load by thread 2 at ltaddressgt size ltnumbergt    at ltaddressgt  function which is ultimately called from within my for loop codepre  pWhich according to a hrefhttpvalgrind.orgdocsmanualdrdmanual.htmldrdmanual.dataraces relnofollowthe valgrind manuala is exactly what youd expect with race conditions. Certainly this kind of weirdly appearingdisappearing issue seems consistent with the kinds of nondeterministic errors race conditions would give, but I dont understand how, if every call which gives apparent race conditions is in a critical section.p  pThings which could be wrong but I dont think are includep  ul lipAll private variables are initialized inside the codeforloopscode because theyre thread local.pli lipIve checked that shared variables have the same memory address while private variables have different memory addresses.pli lipIm not sure synchronization would help, but given there are implicit codebarriercode directives on entry and exit to codecriticalcode directives and Ive tried versions of my code where every function call is enclosed in a uniquely named critical section I think we can rule that out.pli ul  pstrongAny thoughts on how to best proceed would be hugely appreciated.strong Ive been banging my head against this all day. Obviously Im not looking for a, Oh  heres the problem type answer, but more how best to proceed in terms of debuggingdeconstructing.p  pThings which could be an issue, or might be helpfulp  ul lipThere are some stdVectors in the code which utilize the vector.pushback function to add elements. I remember reading that resizing vectors isnt threadsafe, but the vectors are only private variables, so not shared between threads. I figured this would be OKpli lipIf I enclose the entire codeforloopcode body in an codecriticalcode directive and slowly shrink back the end of the codeblock so an ever growing region at the end of the codeforloopcode is outside the critical section it runs fine until I expose one of a the function calls, at which point segfaulting resumes. Analyzing this binary with Valgrind shows race conditions in many other function calls, not just the one I exposed.pli lipOne of the function calls is to a GSL function, which doesnt trigger any race conditions according to Valgrind. pli lipDo I need to go and explicitly define private and shared variables in the functions being called If so, this seems somewhat limiting for OpenMP  would this not mean you need to have OpenMP compatibility for any legacy code you callpli lipIs parallelizing a big codeforloopcode just not something that workspli lipIf youve read this far, thank you and Godspeed.pli ul

Negative 9568 pIm currently working on adding Arabic support into a product which is running a .Net Compact Framework application on top of Windows CE 5.0. Arabic support has been added into the OS and the .Net application is aware of the ARsa locale. Arabic translations for the UI elements are stored in a resource file, in which they are the correct way round and read correctly according to one of my colleagues. When the application runs, it looks like all the characters are reversed which makes it look like either the OS or the application is mirroring them to give the RTL support. When we reverse the strings in the resource file, it still appears the same.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on what could possibly be going wrong and if there is any solutionp

Negative 9568 pRight now, I have a simple web application that displays the entries of a database. One of the fields that is visible in the database is a bool, which is true, false, or neither. Everything in the database originally should have the bool set to neither. p  pHeres what I want to get working when a user edits an entry in the table by selecting either true or false for the bool field, I want to be able to run some C code that I have already written and have that entry deleted from the database.

Negative 9568 pI know it is a bit vague of a question, but I have a webpage that is just a wall of youtube videos. I have the videos separated into divs called rows and there are about 3, maybe 4 videos per row. In my script I am using a jQuery function to create SWFobjects for each video and I have some simple php creating each row of videos inside a wordpress loop.p  pMy question is is there a way to load a row, 3 or 4 videos, and after that completes to continue the wordpress loop to the next row and so on. I believe my answer lies with ajax but I have no experience with it. I know jquery has some great tools and methods to use to help with ajax, but I dont know where to start and what I am even looking for.p  pLiterally all that webpage does is loop through this bit of code below, this is reduced by a bit. But it runs this function 3 times then goes to the next row and does it 3 more times until wordpress says there are no more posts in that category. How can i get ajax to do one row at a time and not all at once.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var youtubeID  ltphp echo urlYoutube pass the php var to js vargt     var divID  ltphp echo divNamegt     getVideoSMLyoutubeID, divID ltscriptgt codepre  pA nice and generous push in the right direction would be greatly appreciated, if not an answer.p
Negative 9568 pI have a website with a video in the header that is set to auto play when the page loads. It works great on all web browsers except for iPhone and iPad.  I recently discovered that the iPhone wont allow auto play, which explains why when I open it up on the iPhone there is a black box with a line through the play button where the video should be.  I cant even get it to load on the iPad.  I havent been able to test on Android or the other mobile devices since I dont own any of them. Btw I am using Video.js.p  pHeres what Im trying to do and need some help Since my video has to auto play, I want to have the poster image display rather than the video if a particular device like the iPhone wont allow auto play.  Is this possible I tried, but I cant get the poster image to show though.  Instead, it just shows that ugly black box with play button with a line through it.  I need help getting the poster image to display instead.  I thought this would happen automatically but it isnt.  Does anyone know how to do this  I even wondered if theres a way to write a fallback statement that says something like this If no auto play then display image. Ive seen fallback statements for Flash, so why not have one for a device that doesnt allow auto play. Im trying to get the code right, but Im not a php expert so I need some help.  Your help is appreciated thank you.p

Negative 9568 pI have a Swing GUI that allows a user to add JTextFields to the GUI as needed.  When I run this locally on the console on ubuntu, everything works fine..  When I run the GUI from Cygwin on a Windows box using X11 forwarding, everything starts out fine, but when I click the add button to put a new JTextField on the GUI, the text field shows up as expected, but I cant click in it or modify it, etc., for a long time.  In fact, I cant click in the original text fields either..  After a little more than 30 seconds, the text fields come back to life and work normally until I click add again.p  pIve included a SSCCE below that demonstrates the problem.  Again, this only seems to happen when running with X11forwarding, and if I run on the Ubuntu console directly, it works as expected, so Im not sure if this will be reproduceable for everyone else.p  pOne last piece of information  in my real program, clicking the add button causes a JComboBox and two JTextFields to be added.

To be specific, I want to be able to be able to generate a series of assembly instructions at runtime these will be very simple and create an executable that will execute them. I can generate the assembly myself I would just like to have a library to help deal with all of the headers and other parts of the .exe file I started looking into a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms809762.aspx relnofollowPortable Executable File Formata but it far too complicated for me to deal with. Im not lazy but as a highlevel programmer I feel that this stuff is way under my head. The specific mechanics of the library are not important as long as it works for either Java or C. Java is highly preferred, however.p  pAny knowledge pertaining to any sort of framework that would be helpful in this regard would be appreciated. p

I have done various things with batch files in the past, but have been looking at PowerShell.p  pAs it is I really dont have any idea where to begin or if what I want to achieve is even possible.p  pMy boss is after getting printing costs reduced so need to look at being able to set a printer default of black and white, a user then has to manually select colour through preferences and then it will automatically revert back to a default of black and white.p  pI have been looking at various things online today and cant seem to find anything specific to this requirement, so not sure it is even possible.p  pI have considered the possibility of either a logon script that forces the print settings back or some form of task that will run say every hour in the background.p  pWe use UTAX devices, but they are rebadged Kyocera.p  pThe printers are connected to PCs via network, but there is no server involved. Each printer is a local install on each PC, no shares or anything like that.p  pPCs are running mix of Win7 and WinXP.p  pSomething Ive also considered is two instances of the printer installed  1 for colour and 1 for black and white, naming them to reflect what they are. But Im not convinced this will take off due to people being set in their ways for printing.p  pThe driver version we have to work with is UTAX v6.0.2212. You can set profiles, but the factory default is colour and also if the user logs on and they change to colour from the printing default of black and white and forget to revert back then it remains on setting of colour.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 9568 pSo Im learning how to program with Python my first programming language and Im a complete newbie with it. Im using inventwithpython as well as codecademy.com. The thing with codecademy is that they really arent that good at teaching programming from what I am comparing it towards with inventwithpython. On one of the tutorials on there they want me to define two functions and call them using each other. I think Im very close to doing this correctly and I feel the right way of doing this is staring me right in the face. So here is the code p  precodedef cubenumber2     pine   number23      return pine  def bythreenumber2     if number2  3  0         return cubenumber2     else         return False  number2  rawinputPick a number  bythreenumber2 codepre  pAnd here is the error I get from the interface p  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File python, line 13, in ltmodulegt   File python, line 6, in bythree TypeError not all arguments converted during string formatting codepre  pI tried converting that pine to a string format, but didnt work, so I just reverted it back. Codecademy sucks in my opinion and Im just using it because I cant find many good sources other than the inventwithpython site to learn how to program with Python.p

So surfing the net, i have found the post  a hrefhttpwww.mkyong.comstruts2struts2sdoubleselectexample relnofollowhttpwww.mkyong.comstruts2struts2sdoubleselectexamplea, i have try the example suggested by the blogger, but when i choose an element from the first select, the second select did not change its value.p  pSo, i have debbuged it with firebug on mozilla 17.01 and the javascript autogenerated with the jsp tag doubleselect seems good, cause i have any error into the console. Debugging the code autogenerated with the struts 2 tag, sdoubleselect, i have saw that option element are removed well, but maybe the second select is not refreshed. So for example on the example, when the page is in the firse select i have .net language and in the second .sharp and .vnet, when in the first i choose java, onChange, onDebugg the function that permits to change items to the second select is trigger, the old options are deleted , and the new options are created ad inserted in the the second, but the content of the second select did not change on the page.p  pSo on the link, i have used used the last exampe, programming languagep  pjsp formp  precode         ltformmain actionDoubleSelectAction idchannelerFormgt                    ltsdoubleselect labelLanguage Java List                      id Test1                      namelanguage1                      listlanguageMap.keySet                      doubleIdsecondoItem                     doubleNamelanguage2                      doubleListlanguageMap.gettop   gt          ltformmaingt   codepre  pDefine the Actionp  precodepublic class DoubleSelectAction extends ActionSupport   private String language1 private String language2  Map languageMap   public String getLanguage1      return language1   public void setLanguage1String language1      this.language1  language1   public String getLanguage2      return language2   public void setLanguage2String language2      this.language2  language2   public Map getLanguageMap      return languageMap   public void setLanguageMapMap languageMap      this.languageMap  languageMap   public DoubleSelectAction   languageMap new HashMap               languageMap.putJava,          new ArrayListltStringgtArrays.asListSpring, Hibernate, Struts 2       languageMap.put.Net, new ArrayListltStringgtArrays.asListVB.Net, C       languageMap.putJavaScript, new ArrayListltStringgtArrays.asListjQuery   public String execute      return SUCCESS   public String display      return NONE  codepre  pSo i would like to know if someone has had the same problem,p  pthanx for yours time.p

Negative 9568 pOkay I know this question is painfully simple, and Ill admit that I am pretty new to C as well.  But the title doesnt describe the entire situation here so hear me out.p  pI need to alter a URL string which is being created in a C code behind, removing the substring .aspx from the end of the string.  So basically I know that my URL, coming into this class, will be something like Blah.aspx and I want to get rid of the .aspx part of that string.  I assume this is quite easy to do by just finding that substring, and removing it if it exists or some similar strategy, would appreciate if someone has an elegant solution for it if theyve thought done it before.  Here is the problemp  pBecause strings are immutable, it is not possible without using unsafe code to modify the value of a string object after it has been created.  This is from the MSDN official website.  So Im wondering now, if strings are truly immutable, then I simply cant shouldnt alter the string after it has been made.  So how can I make sure that what Im planning to do is safep

Negative 9568 ul liI have an application that has a list of buttons created dynamically in the code. When one of these buttons is clicked, a new activity containing a similar list of buttons is added on top of the stack.li liThese lists of buttons each have a different view for portrait and landscape, so I am overriding OnConfigurationChanged to lay update the existing buttons because it is faster than letting the view recreate itself.li liWhen the second view changes orientation, even though the previous activity is in the background, it performs the changes to the buttons in its list.li liThe second activity is also transparent and you can see the previous activity through it. Normally you wont see the first activity from the second activity, but the entire second activity is in a HorizontalScrollView and the user can slide the view off the screen which then finishes the activity and goes back to the first activity.li liThe problem is that when there are hundreds of buttons on each activity and both activities are being updated on orientation change, things slow down considerably.li ul  pIn all my cases, I have noticed that things go smoothly if only one activity is being updated on orientation change. Is there any way I can postpone the previous activities changes OnConfigurationChange or speed this up in generalp

Negative 9568 pI am trying to write a known pattern ie 0xFFFFFFFF or 0x00000000 on top of already written flash memory, to invalidate portions of it for a primitive file system. But it doesnt work for me on the STM32L series as it does on the STM32F series.p  pI am used to the STM32F family of microcontrollers, where the flash memory is erased to 0xFFFFFFFF and written with 0s.  You can write anything you want to erase memory, iep  precode write 0x00001234 on top of 0xFFFFFFFF gt 0x00001234 codepre  pand you can write 0x00000000 all zeros on top of anythingp  precode write 0x00000000 on top of 0x00001234 gt 0x0000000 codepre  pI am now using the STM32L family low power, and the flash memory is totally different. It is erased to 0x00000000, and written with 1s. However, I dont know how to reliably write all ones.  For example, if I erase, I can do thisp  precode write 0x01020304 on top of 0x00000000 gt 0x01020304 codepre  pbut if I tryp  precode write 0xFFFFFFFF on top of 0x01020304 gt 0xFFFFFFBF  codepre  pNote that the final answer has a emBem in it. It is not all ones. In fact, if I write bytes 0x00 to 0xFF to a freshly erased page of memory, and then write 0xFFFFFFFFFF all over it, I get very glitchy resultsp  precodeff ff ff bf ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff fb f7 ff ff ff fd ff ff ff ff ff ff f7 ff ff ff ff fe ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 7f f7 ff ff ff ff ff ff fb ff ff ff ef ff ff ff ff ff ff ff df fe ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 7f f7 ff ff ff ff ff ff fb ff ff ff ef ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff bf ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff fb f7 ff ff ff fd ff ff ff ff ff ff f7 ff ff ff df f7 ff ff ff fd ff ff ff ff ff ff f7 fe ff ff ff ff ff ff bf ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff fd ff ff ff ff ff ff fb ff ff ff ef ff ff ff ff ff ff ff bf fe ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 7f fb ff ff ff ff ff ff fb ff ff ff ef ff ff ff ff ff ff ff bf fe ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 7f ff ff ff ef f7 ff ff ff fd ff ff ff ff ff ff f7 fe ff ff ff ff ff ff bf ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff fb ff ff ff codepre  pHere is the pseudo code I am using FlashWrite is a wrapper around the STM std periph library.

Negative 9568 pIm trying to design a simple and reliable masterslaves protocol for a 2wires RS485 bus.p  pAll the nodes on the bus have a unique address. One node is the master that is the only node that is able to start communications. All other nodes cant send anything until the master sends a request to them.p  pI was thinking on simple requestresponse protocol the master sends a request to a slave and wait for its answer. After that, M sends a request to another slave. Three scenarios could happen.p  ol liBoth frames request and response are correctly received by the destination and the transaction ends with no problem.li liThe request from the master isnt received by the slave checksum error. After a timeout, the master sends again the request. No problem.li liThe response from the slave isnt received by the master checksum error. After a timeout, the master could send again the request.li ol  pIMHO, the last scenario is problematic.  The slave isnt able to understand if the second request is exactly the same of the first, so it processes the request two times. What happens if the request is move the motor two steps, give me if a switch is pressend since last request, toggle a relay, and so onp  pI think the simplest requestresponse protocol cant work well, except if the application level knows the limitations of the protocol and avoids requests that are dangerous if transmitted two times.p  pHave you some good simple and reliable protocol to suggest I dont want to reinvent the wheel.p

For example, the waveform shown above might only be 8MHz wide but channel 1 itself might have an allocation that is 10MHz wide the device varies its bandwidth based on its offered load.p  pThe X axis is MHz and a channel is defined in terms of MHz so it would be ideal to define the outline in terms of the X axis instead of pixels.p  pAlso, note that this is a realtime chart that is updated up to 10 times per second.  Therefore it would be best if the information was not required to be updated each time new data arrived.p

Negative 9568 pI develop using Eclipse IDE on a Mac running OSX 10.7.5. This program constructs an array of JPanels, when the user clicks a panel all the other panels on the same row or column change color, blue for left mouse button, red for right button. When I run from the IDE everything works fine, at least Ive never seen it fail. But when I create a .jar file and run by double clicking that, most of the time it works fine but every once in a while it doesnt change the color of some of the other panels. p  pTo test I pick one square and alternately right click and left click it. As I said most of the time it works and all the other panels in the same row or the same column change color. But if I right click a square and some of the panels stay blue thats the failure. If I right click the same square again it doesnt change the display the failed panels stay blue. Its like the manager thinks everything is the right color and doesnt bother to update the display. p  pIf I resize the panel or click any other square with either button, all panels flip to the correct color. This code doesnt have an explicit call to repaint but Ive tried that and it doesnt fix the problem. Ive tried reading about repaint manager, but havent found a way to get the display to reliably update. As I said, Ive never seen this happen when running the IDE and most of the time it works as an application too. Just now it took about 50 clicks to get a failure. p  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event. import javax.swing.  public class GUITest extends JPanel   final static int NROWS  81 final static int TOTALSQ  NROWS  NROWS Square [] square  new Square [TOTALSQ]  public GUITest       setLayout new GridLayoutNROWS,NROWS     for int i0 iltTOTALSQ i          square [i]  new Squarei         add square [i]         public void squareClicked int id, int button       determine which row and column     int row  id  NROWS     int col  id  NROWS      change background color of all squares on same row or column     for int i  0 iltTOTALSQ i          if row  i  NROWS  col  i  NROWS             if button  MouseEvent.BUTTON3                 square[i].setBackgroundColor.RED             else                 square[i].setBackgroundColor.BLUE       squareClicked   class Square extends JPanel implements MouseListener      int id  0      which square this is      public Square int id          this.id  id         setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.black         addMouseListenerthis       Square constructor      public void mouseClicked MouseEvent e            public void mouseEntered MouseEvent e            public void mouseExited MouseEvent e            public void mousePressed MouseEvent e            public void mouseReleased MouseEvent e          squareClicked id, e.getButton        Square  public static void main String [] args      JFrame frame  new JFrameGUI Test     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE      GUITest app  new GUITest     frame.setSize800,600     frame.setLocationRelativeTonull     frame.getContentPane.addapp, BorderLayout.CENTER     frame.setVisibletrue   codepre  pI have a second question that might be related. IDE displays much faster than the application does. The IDE updates in a flash. The application updates each panel individually, its noticeably slower. I guess that the IDE is using a double buffered display. I read about that too, but dont see how to make it hold off updating until the entire display is ready.p  pThanks in advance.  p
Negative 9568 pI have an iOS app that is working and able to connect to a RESTful PHP Webservice. The webservice was initially built in native PHP and now I am migrating it to a Symfony2 web service. On the iOS side, I am sending requests as JSON, the server processes the data and returns a JSON response data, everything works pretty well.p  pNow, my symfony2 webservice is able to respond with the correct response to requests made from the browser window or terminal using httpie for testing and it returns json data in the browswer window if I specify .json in the parameters. However, I am not sure how to make the iOS app send the request rather than the browser. I am using the FOSRestBundle if that information is of any significance. Here is an example from the terminal p  precodehttp httpserveripaddresswebappdev.phpusers1.json Acceptapplicationjson codepre  pIt returns json data representation of the user with the id  1 as expected p  precodeHTTP1.1 200 OK Allow GET, PUT, DELETE CacheControl nocache ContentType applicationjson Date Fri, 29 Nov 2013 201543 GMT Server Apache2.2.22 Ubuntu SetCookie PHPSESSIDn8o72oq61isruuov1bqgc9udf5 path TransferEncoding chunked XDebugToken 6c3818 XPoweredBy PHP5.3.101ubuntu3.8        id 1,          lastname Robinson,          firstname Jack,           ....More data truncated ...  codepre  pFrom my browser, I can get the same result by using codehttpserveripaddresswebappdev.phpusers1.jsoncode in the address bar. How can I make the iOS app send the same request I guess the only change I need is in the symfony2 code to accept the request Kindly give a brief example and I can figure out the rest from the example. p  pstrongEdited with more detailstrongp  pJust to clarify, what I need is how to initiate a connection to the serverside REST Symfony2 application. Again, this I have previously done when using native PHP but how do I connect to a Symfony2 route While using the native version, what I did was to construct a dictionaryWithObjectandKeys passing key value pairs of the command on the PHP side and the arguments as JSON and having the server side return JSON data response and a success or failure, simple and straightforward. How can this be done if I am using Symfony2 which I guess the commands now become a route I am using AFNetworking and everything on the iOS client side should not need changes except the part where I connect to Symfony2. Kindly give an example to give me a concrete picture.p

Negative 9568 pI have a website that Ive created using PHP, Mysql, and other HTML, CSS, etc and Im looking into converting the website into a native Iphone App for the app store. I know quite a bit of ObjectiveC and have used Xcode for a couple years but Im confused about one aspect of it. Ive never worked with databases from an app. The database that we have set up is just a good old fashion PHP and Mysql that we connect to. It holds all of the sites users and other information.p  pTherefore, what should I do about accessing this database on the phone Is there a way to use Mysql or is there something else that I can use that would interact with the database separately I know there is SQLite but does that work with Mysql or notp  pAny tutorials or guides you could point me to also would be great. Thanks.p

Negative 9568 pI have had a look on this and other websites but couldnt find anything that exactly matches what I need. What I need is a method of encrypting or obfuscating a file not an exe strongwithout the need for the user to input a passwordstrong this is because I nee a separate program possibly running on another computer with strongno connection to the encrypting machinestrong to be able to read the file. However if someone reads the file in between the two terminals it will look like gibberish and will be hopefully very hard to decrypt. emI currently have a basic caesar shift type encryption.em I understand that this will rely on some level of security through obscurity however any ideas would be very welcome.

Negative 9568 pSo putting it as simply as possible, I have one class which opens a form from inside sub like sop  precodePublic Sub LoadExtension      various code...      Dim form as new frmMain     frmMain.ShowDialog      various code...  End Sub codepre  pAnd inside this form I have two buttons, one will just close the form, so the LoadExtension sub will continue. The other button I want to use to exit the LoadExtension sub inside the main class so that loading stops completely. The button event inside the form module is like sop  precodePrivate Sub btnStopLoadclicksender as object, e as eventargs handles btnStopLoad.click     exit the LoadExtension sub somehow End sub codepre  pWhat is the simplest way to achieve this I thought I could do something like this in the LoadExtension sub after the .ShowDialogp  precodeIf frmMain.btnStopLoad.clicked then     Exit Sub End If codepre  pBut it wont let me do that from the class module, apparently I need to use raise event or something Im not very familiar with the way that events work. Can someone offer me an easy solution Id be very grateful. Ive been looking around the web for a solution but havent had any success. Thanks for your time.p

Adding a binary search into the search engine like Google has where if you start typing in a couple of keywords it would narrow down the search results from a database list to the ones container the same keywords.  For example if you typed in lady into the search engine, anything within the binary searchs database that contains lady would appear.

Negative 9568 pI have a database that has in excess on 200,000 rows. When I was writing a VBA script I had a database of about 20,000 rows in mind so I didnt care whether the database was filtered or not because the VBA script ran quickly. So given the realization that the database is huge and testing the VBA script I was surprised to notice how slowly it ran. So without further to say this is how my code looks like p  precodeSet wsDB  ThisWorkbook.SheetsDB Dim nameIndex As Long nameIndex  Application.Matchname, wsDB.Rows1, 0 Dim formula As String    formula  IFERRORAVERAGEIFS  GRAnameIndex  ,  GRAdateIndex  ,R2C,  GRAcellNameIndex  ,RC1  , codepre  pwhere GRA is a function that returns the address of the range of a column.p  precodePrivate Function GRAByRef rngIndex As Long    GRA  DB  CStrRangeCells2, rngIndex, CellsrowNos, rngIndex.Address1, 1, xlR1C1, 0, 0 End Function codepre  pSo given that I now filter the table beforehand how can I adjust my code so that it ignores all the hidden rows and takes into account only what is visible. Of course I am aware that a simple dirty solution would be to simply copy the filter database and paste it in a new sheet but that will affect the performance which is what Im trying to improve.p

Negative 9568 pI am writing a website which will automatically generate emails to users on special occasions e.g. the activation email after user registration. The problem is, SMTP authentication is required, but the website will be hosted on a web hosting service, which does not have Pear Mail installed. I have read many articles on the Internet, saying that either Pear Mail, PHPMailer or SwiftMailer is required for SMTP authentication. As I do not have the authority to install any of them, what can I do in the PHP scripting level if none of the above existsp  pA side question is, if Pear Mail, PHPMailer or SwiftMailer is a PHP library, does it mean we can actually perform SMTP authentication by writing our own PHP codep  pstrongAddedstrong This link a hrefhttpwww.webdeveloper.comforumshowthread.php233847AWaytoSendSMTPMailwoPEAR relnofollowhttpwww.webdeveloper.comforumshowthread.php233847AWaytoSendSMTPMailwoPEARa seems to have provided a solution, but when I tried, nothing happened no email was sent.

Negative 9568 pI am working on a project to retrieve data from a SOAP webservice and store it in a database for later use using JPA.  Presently, I am using Spring WS as the client, and generating web service classes using JAXB.  p  pThe goal is to replicate all of the data contained in these classes which are rather large faithfully in the database, and to that end it is mildly tempting to apply JPA annotations to the JAXB generated classes.  In the long run this seems dangerous, because the generated classes seem rather ephemeral, and I would do a lot of work reapplying jpa annotations while regenerating code if the wsdl ever changed.  p  pThe other option is to have my webservice client copy data into JPA entities created by me, possibly using a factory pattern.  This decouples JPA persistence from the possibly changing whims of the WSDL designer, and somehow feels safer.  It also feels safer because the entity classes can never be overwritten by a build task.  p  pWhat is the best practice for this situation  Obviously, excessive decoupling does not pay off when it means lots of data transfer objects, but is this case special  Should JAXB created classes be used only in the webservice client, and quickly forgotten by the higher level applicationp

Negative 9568 pMy query is related to SORCVBUF option in setsocketopt api. When the new value specified for SORCVBUF in setsockopt will take effectp  pI am testing the flow control of TCPIP and below is my environment.  The client program is a slow reader and it has a single socket.  To test the flow control, I am reducing the value of SORCVBUF to 5000 bytes after establishing the connection and before receiving the data. My expectation is that, my server program after sending 5000 bytes should wait for client to read. But the server program sends the data till 60000 bytes. After that the server program will wait for client to read. Once the client reads 55000 bytes, then I see the new value of receive buffer 5000bytes getting utilized.p  pIs it expected I guess effect of setsocketopt should be  immediate. The initial value of receive buffer should not have any effect after setsocketopt.p  pRegards, Prashanthp

Negative 9568 pI am trying to create a parent object that has multiple children in a 1 to many relationship. I am not referencing the Parent object on the child object, instead I am mapping its keycolumn as a field. p  pWhen I try to save this object for the first time, it works as expected without any issues cascading all the Ids and children. When I try to get the object from the database, update some properties on it and resave it again, it fails. The actual error message I am getting is Could not delete collection.p  pThe error above is due to the fact that it is trying to set the ParentId field on the child objects to NULL which violates the FK constraint I have in the db. If I remove this constraint from the DB, the end result is what I want however, I do not want it to perform this update setting parent id to null at all and Im not sure why it is. From what I can tell in the SQL code it is generating and sending to the DB, everything else appears to be correct and it would all work if it wasnt for that last update statement.p  pObviously, I must have something wrong with my mapping but I cannot figure out what. I tried adding Not.KeyUpdate but that simply made it not generate a key at all.

Negative 9568 pI have had a look at using Om for rich client website design. This also is my first time using core.async. Reading the tutorial a hrefhttpsgithub.comswannodetteomwikiBasicTutorialhttpsgithub.comswannodetteomwikiBasicTutoriala I have seen the usage of a core.async channel to handle the delete operation as opposed to doing all the work in the handler. I was under the impression that using that channel for deletion was merely done because the delete callback was declared in a scope where you have a cursor on an itemlevel where you actually want to manipulate the list containing that item.p  pTo get more insights into channels I have seen Rich Hickeys talk a hrefhttpwww.infoq.compresentationsclojurecoreasynchttpwww.infoq.compresentationsclojurecoreasynca where he explains how its a good idea to use channels to get application logic out of eventcallbacks. This made me wonder whether the actual purpose of the delete channel in the tutorial was to show that way of structuring an application. If so,p  ul lipwhat are best practices associated with that pattern pli lipShould one create individual channels for all kinds of events I.e. If I add a controller to create a new event, would I also create a new channel for object creations that is then used to get objects to be added to the global state at another place in the applicationpli lipLets say I have a list of items, and one items has a detailedconcise state flag. If codedetailedcode is codetruecode it will display more information, if codedetailedcode is codefalsecode it will display fewer information. I have associated a onclick event that uses codeomtransactcode on the cursor being a view to the list item within the global state object. pli ul  pre classlangclj prettyprintoverridecodelet [toggledetailhandler        fn [e]         omtransact getin myitem [state]                       conj  detailed not detailed ]   html [li onclick toggledetailhandler          ... ]  codepre  pI realize that this might be a very succinct snippet where the overall benefit of using channels as a means to decouple the callback event from the acutal logic changes does at first not seem worth the effort but the overall benefits with more complex examples outweigh this. But on the other hand introducing an extra channel for such detailnotdetailed toggling seems to add a fair amount of load to the source code as well.p  pIt would be great if you could give some hintstips or other thoughts on the whole design issue and put them into strongperspectivestrong.

I try to do comparisons on enums declared in C.p  pObviously, C enums are not turned into Swift enums, but I am having trouble figuring out how to use them.p  pHeres a sample of what you will see in the test projectp  pI have a couple of C files that declare enumsp  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt  typedef enum      StandardEnumTypeUndef   0xFF,     StandardEnumTypeValue0  0x00,     StandardEnumTypeValue1  0x01,     StandardEnumTypeValue2  0x02  StandardEnumType  typedef NSENUM  unsigned char, AppleEnumType       AppleEnumTypeUndef   0xFF,     AppleEnumTypeValue0  0x00,     AppleEnumTypeValue1  0x01,     AppleEnumTypeValue2  0x02   StandardEnumType translateIntToEnumValue  int inIntValue  int translateEnumValueToInt  StandardEnumType inValue   AppleEnumType translateIntToAppleEnumValue  int inIntValue  int translateAppleEnumValueToInt  AppleEnumType inValue  codepre  pThe functions mentioned do pretty much what it says on the tin. I wont include them.p  pI did the bridging header and all that.p  pI am trying to use them in the initial load of the Swift appp  precode    func applicationapplication UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions NSDictionary gt Bool              let testStandardConstStandardEnumType  translateIntToEnumValue  0           Nope.         if  testStandardConst.toRaw  0                                          This dont work.         if  testStandardConst  StandardEnumTypeValue0                                          Neither does this.         if  testStandardConst  StandardEnumTypeValue0.toRaw                                          Not this one, either.         if  testStandardConst.toRaw  StandardEnumTypeValue0                                          let testAppleConstAppleEnumType  translateIntToAppleEnumValue  0           This dont work.         if  testAppleConst  AppleEnumType.AppleEnumTypeValue0                                          Neither does this.         if  testAppleConst  AppleEnumType.AppleEnumTypeValue0.toRaw                                          Nor this.         if  testAppleConst  .AppleEnumTypeValue0                                          return true      codepre  pI cant seem to get the  enums to compare to either ints or anything else.p  pI am often humbled by the stupid errors I make, and sometimes need them pointed out to me, so please humble me.p  pThanksp
Negative 9568 pI designed some inputs with a button inside of a fieldset, and it seemed a good idea when I worked with fixed width. For example, the width of the input is code205pxcode, the submit button is code40pxcode width by using codepaddingcode, codedisplayblockcode and codepositionabsolutecode.p  pBut now I use these inputs in different layouts, for example in the footer, with 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns, and I want that the input width adapts getting the full width of the fieldset container, except the width of the submit button.p  pAnd this is the HTML structurep  precodeltfieldset classfieldsetgt     ltinput typetext classfield names placeholderBuscargt     ltspangt         ltinput value typesubmitgt     ltspangt ltfieldsetgt codepre  pI insert the icon using the pseudoselector codebeforecode in the codeltspangtcode.

Would you use Javascript to do that Is it excessive It would be something like this codep  precodedocument.readyfunction      window.onresize, function                var wwindow,ddocument,ed.documentElement,gd.getElementsByTagNamebody[0],xw.innerWidthe.clientWidthg.clientWidth,yw.innerHeighte.clientHeightg.clientHeight         var inputWidth  widgetID fieldset.width  40              widgetID fieldset input.csswidth, inputWidth  px      .resize   codepre  pWhat would you do Thanks in advance p

Negative 9568 pI am trying to use winless to compile several .less and .css files to a single site.css file that is checked into source control.p  pBecause I open and edit the .less and .css files that are checked in from within visual studio, it automatically checks them out.p  pHowever when I try to compile, the output files that are checked into source control, they are read only files when they arent checked out, so winless throws an error.p  pManually checking out the output files or removing the readonly flags solves the issue, but Id prefer it if it could happen automatically.p  pAnswer doesnt necessarily need to be the approach that Im trying right now.

Negative 9568 pI want to render a large randomized world 1600x24000 pixels in size and draw it onto the screen. The point is not for me to see the whole map at once though, so this is very laggy even when the majority of the image goes offscreen. I have the idea of splitting the world into 24 different hidden canvases, each 1600x1000 in size. These would be generated when the application is loaded and saved into a hidden canvas., where only one is drawn at a timep  pRemember that this is a randomly generated image using ctx graphics,  not a static image. I have not yet been able to try it out. What should I expect Is this efficient How could I do it betterp  pI would like to add that the current way I am handling this is by drawing only the visible part each and every frame. However, there are usually 80120 images onscreen at a time and having to render all these in real time can get rather laggy on mobile. I would hope that prerendering a large section and drawing it as a single image would speed things up.p

I am required to remove index.php from all the article pages and make them clean URLs for SEO purpose. I am facing two problems. The problems seem to be similar in nature hence quoting both in same question.p  pstrongFor Addon domainsstrong  I changed the document root of the domains to the public folder of Laravel. Then added the code below in .htaccess file to make the URLs cleaner without the index.php partp  precodeOptions MultiViews RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteRule . index.php1 [L] codepre  pThough the code works fine if URLs are entered directly to browsers address bar. The problem is that now when I search my site in Google.com using strongemsitemysite.comemstrong it shows some of the pages without the index.php part in the URL while some of the pages with index.php in the URL. The worst thing is that some of the the pages appear twice  once with index.php in URL and second time without index.php p  pe.g. the search result would contain pages with URLS like this  p  precode           www.mysite.comindex.phparticle1content            www.mysite.comarticle1content codepre  pIf I am not wrong this would result in duplicate content. Moreover when I open the article page through the URL having index.php, all the other URLs on that page  like internal links and side bar articles also appear with index.php in their URL. What should I do to completely remove index.php from URLs and google index. Please help.p  pSorry for making the question too long but my second problem seems to be of similar nature p  pstrongFor primary Domain strong I have added whole of the site code in publichtml and then added this piece of code to .htaccess file in publichtml to change the document root p  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteBase   RewriteCond HTTPHOST primarydomain.com [NC,OR] RewriteCond HTTPHOST www.primarydomain.com RewriteCond REQUESTURI public RewriteRule . public1 [L] codepre  pand also code to remove index.php part in .htaccess file of public folder  same as that in addon domains . The problem is that on searching in Google each and every article page appear twice with URLs looking something like this p  blockquote   pwww.primarydomain.comarticle1contentbr   www.primarydomain.compublicindex.phparticle1contentp blockquote  pgoogle is indexing the URL with publicindex.php part as well. What should I do to completely get rid of these not so clean URLs.p  pThanks for tolerating such a long question  any help would be appreciated. Regards.p

Negative 9568 pI have a PHP script with HTML forms for user to pick several things, after that it communicates with database and prints out the result in the form of a table. Everything is formatted with CSS.p  pNow I would like to make those results also saved in an xls file, ideally using some sort of a Save file button appearing after the script finish its work. For that to work though I have to use PHPExcel write commands in several different parts of the script. But those parts are also responsible for the output on the website.p  pI have tried using PEAR and recently also PHPExcel and I think I can make it work with saving the file on the server, but I couldnt do it with sending to browser option so popping up message with Save file as.... When I try to do it that way, it prints out all kinds of gibberish signs on the website and doesnt pop up with save file option at all. I found out this is  because I am printing and echoing all sort of things in between the PHPExcel write commands, but I am not sure how to do it differently.p  pSo I guess my question is Is it possible in PHPExcel or any other library to use its write commands all over the PHP script with all sort of echos and HTML code in between while using the send to browser optionp  pThanks you in advance for answers and help.p

Negative 9568 pThis is the code of index.php that displays a form with a Connect Me button. I suppose that when user will press that button, it will change to Connecting... and will send the POST data to startTransaction.php script that is in the same directory and will show a message after the POST  data is sent, or else will display an error message if any error occurs.

Thanks.p  pFurther edit after Stephens comment.. The scenario is in the editing of a User. A user can have a CompanyInstituion Id as part of its model. I wish to present a list of companies to the operator not necessarily the User to allow them to attach a company id to that user. So in concept its dead simple  present a list of companies to pick from. Press a select link on the company line and return to the controller to sort it out. Hence I need to preserve the UserId in the Viewbag  yes I can create a viewmodel if needed but getting the company id alone would be a start.. So thats it.. present the list, select one and return it.. I dont really want to use checkboxes anyway.. I kind of got there after trying some things. I originally had the submit button in the loop before I added the checkbox. I did try putting the Company Id on the button but that didnt work either.p

Negative 9568 pIve just discovered that you can include an .axml layout file inside of another by using the  tag. This is great, allowing encapsulation of some common layout themes, however what Im now wondering is whether there is a way to bind some codelogic to the included layoutp  pMy include layout contains a few buttons, and Id like each of these buttons to take the user to a different Activity. Obviously, I dont want to have to repeat the code inside of each Activity so is there a way I can write a class that contains the logic for the included layout and bind itp  pIf anyone could provide an example that would be greatly appreciated p

In this day and age, it makes sense that the Unicode character set, encoded via UTF8 a codecharcodebased encoding, would therefore be used as the character set and encoding of the codeexecution character setcode.  To my understanding, this is the case on Linux.  However, sadly, this is strongnotstrong the case on Windows  even MSVC 2013.p  pThis leads to the first of my two questions.p  hr  pemQuestion 1em Please confirm that Im correct in the following paragraph.p  pWith this background, heres my question.  strongIn MSVC, including VS 2013, it seems that the codeexecution character setcode is one of the many possible ANSI character sets, using one of the many possible emcode pagesem corresponding to that particular given ANSI character set to define the encoding  rather than the Unicode character set with UTF8 encoding.strong  Note that I am asking about the NONWIDE codeexecution character setcode.  Is this correctp  hr  pemBACKGROUND, CONTINUEDem assuming Im correct in Question 1p  pIf I understand things correctly, than the above bolded paragraph is arguably a large part of the cause of the insanity of using the ANSI API on Windows.p  pSpecifically, consider the sane case  in which Unicode and UTF8 are used as the codeexecution character setcode.p  pIn this case, it does not matter what machine the code is compiled on, or when, and it does not matter what machine the code runs on, or when.  The actual raw bytes of a string literal will always be internally represented in the Unicode character set with UTF8 as the encoding, and the runtime system will always treat such strings, semantically, as UTF8.p  pNo such luck in the insane case if I understand correctly, in which ANSI character sets and code page encodings are used as the codeexecution character setcode.  In this case the Windows world, the runtime behavior may be strongaffectedstrong by the machine that the code is compiled on, in comparison with the machine the code runs on.p  hr  pemHere, then, is Question 2em Again, please confirm that Im correct in the following paragraph.p  pWith this continued background in mind, I suspect that strongSpecifically, with MSVC, the codeexecution character setcode and its encoding depends in some notsoeasytounderstand way on the locale selected by the emcompilerem on the machine the compiler is running on, at the time of compilation.  This will determine the raw bytes for character literals that are burned into the executable.  And, at runtime, the MSVC C runtime library may be using a emdifferentem codeexecution character setcode and encoding to eminterpretem the raw bytes of character literals that were burned into the executable.strong Am I correctp  pI may add examples into this question at some point.p  hr  pemFINAL COMMENTSemp  pFundamentally, if I understand correctly, the above bolded paragraph explains the insanity of using the ANSI API on Windows.  Due to the possible difference between the ANSI character set and encoding chosen by the emcompilerem and the ANSI character set and encoding chosen by the C runtime, nonASCII characters in string literals may not appear as expected in a running MSVC program when the ANSI API is used in the program.p  pNote that the ANSI insanity really only applies to string literals, because according to the C standard the actual source code must be written in a subset of ASCII and source code comments are discarded by the compiler.p  pThe description above is the best current understanding I have of the ANSI API on Windows in regards to string literals.  I would like confirmation that my explanation is wellformed and that my understanding is correct.p

Negative 9568 pI am making a function in iOS where I am adding a new contact to a users address book programmatically, which is all going fine. The next step is to send that new contact a message via Whatsapp, which is not very hard either. The purpose is to directly show the chat screen with the new contact. The problem is however that Whatsapp does sync its contacts now and then. I am using the following intent for Whatsappp  precodevar whatsappUrl  NSURLstringwhatsappsendtextencodedmessageampabidid       codepre  pWhere the message is an encoded string and the id is the id from the freshly added contact. When my program opens Whatsapp with that method, everything is going fine when the contact was already in the address book. When that contact is newly added, the Whatsapp screen will not go directly to that screen. Instead it will show the picker for all the contacts.p  pLong story short, I want to refresh Whatsapps contacts using my code, in order to send the user directly to the Whatsapp chat screen of the new contact instead of the contact picker screen, which is because Whatsapps contacts are not synced yet with the new contact.p  pI hope somebody has the magic knowledge which can help mep

This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file in your applications project, when using an IDE such as Eclipse. If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on. However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality. If you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message. If you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem. If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation. 1 error aborting ErrorExecution failed for task apppreDexDebug. gt com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException Process command CProgram FilesJavajdk1.8.025binjava.exe finished with nonzero exit value 1 InformationBUILD FAILED InformationTotal time 1 mins 29.785 secs Information1 error Information2 warnings InformationSee complete output in console codepre  pI have worked out that the codejavax.transaction.HeuristicCommitException.classcode is in codetransactionapi1.1.jarcode, which is a dependencies downloaded automatically when I import 2 above lines in my Gradle.p  pCould anyone help me solve this problemp

Negative 9568 pIn a Rails 3.2.16  Unicorn 4.8.3  Sidekiq 3.0.2  Redis 2.8.19 setup, I am using a worker to schedule a job that needs to be run in a predetermined time in the future. The worker is simple enough  p  precodeclass ListingEndWorker    include SidekiqWorker   include SidekiqStatusWorker    def performlistingid     Listing.findlistingid.updateattributes expired true, expiredat Time.now   end  end codepre  pThe problem is that the worker is hitandmiss, it often but not always disappears from my queue with no apparent reason. If I then run the job using the codeperformasynccode method it will complete succesfully. I am also using the codesidekiqfailurescode gem that stores information about the failed jobs and nothing gets logged there it shouldnt  its not that the workers fail, they just disappear from the queue.p  pAdditionally, I am using the codesidekiqstatuscode gem v. 0.5.2 to store the workers job id and reschedule the job based on an action. The code that handles this as a model aftersave hook is the following   p  precodedef cancelpendingendworker     SidekiqStatus.cancel sidekiqtimeoutjobid     updatecolumn sidekiqtimeoutjobid, nil end  def enqueuelistingendworker     cancelpendingendworker if sidekiqtimeoutjobid     jid  ListingEndWorker.performatenddate, self.id if enddate gt Time.now ampamp active     updatecolumn sidekiqtimeoutjobid, jid if jid end codepre  pNow, I know what youre thinking  something screws up in the previous snippet. But the worker fails to run in cases where no action to reschedule has been taken.p  pAs per usual, I am completely stumped on this. I have no log entries pointing to an error and I cannot find a pattern to this behaviour. What Im looking for here apart from suddenly having a eureka moment while writing this  sadly I didnt is any suggestion on how to troubleshoot this, or any similar cases and your course of action.p
Negative 9568 pGood day. p  pI am building an Android Application. In my main activity, I have a codeFragmentPageAdpatercode and what I basically do is I have this reusable Fragment class that I instantiate three times. p  pMy fragment contains data for three different pages. I use the current Active Tab in my action bar to be able to figure out and filter which data I should show the user. The data is basically a list dogs, cats, birds and the user can select a breed. The dog fragment starts first and when the user selects one, my application highlights the selected row and proceeds to the next one cat fragments. The process repeats until the user is able to select a breed from all three categories.p  pIn order to highlight the user selection, I do this in my codeonItemClickListenercode in my codeListViewcodep  precodeview.setBackgroundColorColor.GREEN  codepre  pwhere codeviewcode is the codeView viewcodeargument in the codeonItemClickListenercode function.p  pHowever, what happens is when I get to the birds fragment and select then scrollswipe back to the dog fragment, the green highlight disappears. p  pWhat I did try was to have an int to mark which breed index was selected, and then on the Fragments codeonResumecode, fetch the appropriate int marker and then get my listView, get the child at that row, and then set the background colour.

Negative 9568 pThis is a simplified version to outline my questions.  My server environment is PHP 5.3.29 and MySql 5.1.73cll.  My goal is to create a report described below as efficiently as possible using as few inserts and the low load on environment at anytime.p  pI have a table with 10k users users.  Of the columns in users, one is a status ActiveHold and one is lastlogindate 20150519.p  pEach user collects assets in 3 different tables asset1, asset2, asset3.p  pWe need to have quick access to an Asset Sum Report of each user of specific statuslogin date range and that report is accessed many times in a day. p  pAssembling this data when desired takes too long to select the set of users then count the asset in each table and then doing it multiple times in a day all at once is a stress on the environment.  Creating a php script and using cron to assemble ongoing has become the choice to proceed.p  pThe script will be run by cron to count rows of assets for each user in each table.  The script will run continuously every 10 minutes.  The script will seek records in a table queueusers and if none, it will select all users by specific criteria and list the userid in a table queueusers.  10 minutes later it will run again, seek records in queueusers to limit of 300 userid at a time, then do a combined subquery on each p  precodeSELECT  SELECT COUNT FROM asset1 WHERE asset1.useridid as countasset1,  SELECT COUNT FROM asset2 WHERE asset2.useridid as countasset2, SELECT COUNT FROM asset3 WHERE asset31.useridid as countasset3 codepre  pand insert the result for each userid into a table assetcounts which has columns userid, countdaterun, countasset1,countasset2,countasset3.  The script will test mysqliaffectedrows and if not lt 0  will consider a success  either changed or not changed because the same entry exists and will push the userid into a successarray and then at end, if the count of success array  0 will remove each userid from queueusers.p  pWhen the script finishes the queue and has no userid to process because it is finished working them all, it will instead fill the queue back up and 10 minutes later the summarizing begins again until completed again and so on.  p  pstrongHere are my questionsstrongp  pSelecting all userid that meet the criteria will return thousands of userid.  What is the recommend way to fill in the queueusers table with the least amount of loadprocessing  For example, trying to avoid thousands of insert statements AND too big of one insert statement that could cause unknown issues.  Would this be time for an INSERT and SELECT statement like this to only add into queueusers the userid of users that have status of Active and last login within last 30 daysp  precodeINSERT INTO queueusers userid  SELECT users.userid FROM users WHERE user.status  Active AND lastlogindate BETWEEN CURDATE  INTERVAL 30 DAY AND CURDATE codepre  p2 For each set of 300 at a time that are processed, what is the best way to avoid multiple inserts  Loop through the array of data to create one statement like     INSERT INTO assetcounts  userid, countdaterun, countasset1, countasset2, countasset3      VALUES  45646, NOW,678,32,78 ,  47858, NOW,125,45,19 ..... up to 300 p  p3 Once I have the set of userid that are processed and I want to delete from queueusers, what is the most efficient way  Because the id is an  integer , would it be best to sort successarray like this andp  precodesortsuccessarray  start  resetsuccessarray end  endsuccessarray   ...and then  DELETE from queueusers where id gt start and id lt end codepre  p4 Is the idea above using the subquery the most efficient to grab all counts per user with just one statementp  p5 Do you have an opinion of a better way to go about this taskp

Negative 9568 pIn part of my email program, the user can select the message folder they want to open through a drop down codeJComboBoxcode. This process can take up to twenty seconds depending on how many messages are in the folder, and before this would just freeze up the program. This wasnt desirable, so I utilized codeSwingWorkercode to run the opening of the folder in the background of the GUI and display a progress bar while the folder is being accessed.p  pThe accessing of the folders is implemented with an codeActionListenercode which listens for the folder name selected and sets the selected codeStringcode as the name of the folder to be accessed. Here is the code for the codeActionListenercode, where items is an array of folder names.p  precode    box  new JComboBoxltStringgtitems     box.setEditablefalse     box.addActionListenernew ActionListener              public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                      try                              String selected  Stringbox.getSelectedItem                 ifselected.equalsChoose Folder                     accessFoldernull                 else ifselected.equalsInbox                     accessFolderINBOX                 else                                      selected  TAG  selected                     accessFolderselected                                           catchException ex                              JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Error                    ex.getClass.getName, Error, JOptionPane.ERRORMESSAGE                            codepre  pThe end result of this code is as expected a list of all messages is added to part of the main frame. But the progress bar never shows up. But if I add the code for the codeaccessFoldercode method directly to the main method where the codeActionListenercode is added to the combo box, the progress bar shows up for the entirety of the process and I get the same end result. This is the codeaccessFoldercode code.p  precodeprivate void accessFolderString folderName throws MessagingException, IOException      MessagePanel mPanel  new MessagePanelusername, password, folderName     panel4  mPanel.getJPanel        panel4.setBorderBorderFactory.createLoweredBevelBorder     BorderLayout layout  BorderLayoutpanel3.getLayout     panel3.removelayout.getLayoutComponentBorderLayout.EAST     panel3.addpanel4, BorderLayout.EAST     frame.pack     frame.revalidate  codepre  pSo I cant seem to figure out why the SwingWorker implemented in the codeMessagePanelcode class in codeaccessFoldercode works perfectly fine when implemented anywhere in the code except in an codeActionListenercode. I cant seem to find anywhere a mention of a conflict between codeSwingWorkercode and listeners, and I dont see why there should be, leaving me completely baffled here.

Negative 9568 pI am looking to create an AI environment where users can submit their own code for the AI and let them compete. The language could be anything, but something easy to learn like JavaScript or Python is preferred.p  pBasically I see three options with a couple of variantsp  ol lipMake my own language, e.g. a JavaScript clone with only very basic features like variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, etc. This is a emlotem of work if I want to properly implement common language features.p  p1.1 Take an existing language and strip it to its core. Just remove lots of features from, say, Python until there is nothing left but the above variables, conditionals, etc.. Still a lot of work, especially if I want to keep up to date with upstream though I just could also just ignore upstream.pli lipUse a languages builtin features to lock it down. I know from PHP that you can disable functions and searching around, similar solutions seem to exist for Python with lots and lots of caveats. For this Id need to have a good understanding of all the languages features and not miss anything.p  p2.1. Make a preprocessor that rejects code with dangerous stuff preferably whitelist based. Similar to option 1, except that I only have to implement the parser and not implement all features the preprocessor has to emunderstandem the language so that you can have variables named eval but not call the function named eval. Still a lot of work, but more manageable than option 1.p  p2.2. Run the code in a very lockeddown environment. Chroot, no unnecessary permissions... perhaps in a virtual machine or container. Something in that sense. Id have to research how to achieve this and how to make it give me the results in a secure way, but that seems doable.pli lipManually read through all code. Doable on a small scale or with moderators, though still tedious and errorprone I might miss stuff like codeif user.id  0code.pli ol  pThe way I imagine 2.2 to work is like this run both AIs in a virtual machine or something and constrain it to communicate with the host machine only no other Internet or LAN access. Both AIs run in a separate machine and communicate with each other well, with the playing field, and thereby they see each others positions through an API running on the host.p  pOption 2.2 seems the most doable, but also relatively hacky... I let someones code loose in a virtualized or locked down environment, hoping that thatll keep them in while giving them free game to DoS or break out of the environment. Then again, most other options are not much better.p  hr  pstrongTLDRstrong in essence my question is emhow do I let people give me logic for an AI which I think is most easily done using code and then run that without compromising the functionality of the systemem There must be at least 2 AIs working on the same playing field.p

Negative 9568 pI have a data frame that has some 561 columns and around 7300 rows. Now the problem is that I havent been able to delete the first header row that has V1...V561 as the variable names and instead switch it over to the row below that includes the actual variable names. I tried a lot of techniques since Ive already gone through a number of stack posts here, but none of them seems to be working in my situation. I even tried codecolnamesdf lt lapplydf[1,], as.charactercode but it doesnt really seem to work.

Negative 9568 pI am new to Scala and am building tools for statistical estimation. Consider the following a trait codeprobabilityDistributioncode is defined, which guarantees that classes which inherit from it will be able to perform certain functions, such as compute a density. Two such examples of probability distributions might be a binomial and beta distribution. The support of these two functions is codeIntcode and codeDoublecode, respectively.p  pstrongSet Upstrongp  precodetrait probabilityDistribution extends Serializable    type T   def densityx T Double   case class binomialn Int, p Double extends probabilityDistribution    type T  Int   def densityx Int Double  xp   case class betaalpha Double, beta Double extends probabilityDistribution    type T  Double   def densityx Double Double  xalphabeta  codepre  pNote that the actual mathematical implementations of the codedensitycode methods are simplified above. Now, consider a Mixture Model, in which we have several features or variables which come from different distributions. We may choose to create a list of codeprobabilityDistributioncodes to represent our features.p  precodeval p  Listbinomial5, .5, beta.5,.5 codepre  pSuppose that we are now interested in supplying a vector of hypothetical data values, and wish to query the codedensitycode functions for each respective probability distribution.p  precodeval v  List[Any]2, 0.75 codepre  pstrongThe Problemstrong Of course, we use a zip with map.

Negative 9568 pHi, Im using x264 for live video streaming and Ive noticed that the thread responsible for encoding uses more cpu sometimes 50 more with 1920x1080 when the video stream is frozen i.e. camera is sending the same frame over an over again or when I make it encode the same image over and over again.p  pThis seems somewhat counter intuitive to me, as I would expect x264 to use more processing power when encoding complex scenes other then static ones.p  pMy encoder settings are the followingp  precode1280x720 fps251 timebase00 bitdepth8 cabac0 ref1 deblock100 analyse0x30x113 mehex subme2 psy1 psyrd1.000.00 mixedref1 merange16 chromame1 trellis1 8x8dct0 cqm0 deadzone21,11 fastpskip1 chromaqpoffset0 threads1 lookaheadthreads0 slicedthreads0 slicemaxsize1190 nr60 decimate1 interlaced0 bluraycompat0 constrainedintra0 bframes0 weightp0  keyint1200 keyintmin120 scenecut40 intrarefresh0 rclookahead0 rccrf mbtree0 crf24.0 qcomp0.60 qpmin0 qpmax69 qpstep4 vbvmaxrate1024 vbvbufsize350 crfmax35.0 nalhrdnone codepre  pI created a github gist based on the example.c encoder bundled in x264s source code and tested encoding times with it.

Doesnt the window you call postMessage on already have an origin that we are sending data to How would someone be able to interfere with that Would it be bad to set the targetOrigin to the windows origin using codewindow.location.origincodep  pI understand the importance of checking the event origin on the receiving end as illustrated a hrefhttph30499.www3.hp.comt5FortifyApplicationSecurityXSSandAppSecuritythroughHTML5sPostMessagebap6515002.VgA6G33wBpk relnofollowherea, but I cant seem to wrap my head around why it is bad for the sending end to use the wildcard as the targetOrigin when the window already has a specific origin.p

Negative 9568 pI have noticed that sometimes IIS 8.5 does not return static files .less and .js if they are included into html page. Browser sends request do download them and continue spinning forever. That is illustrated on following image a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comAWx7N.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAWx7N.jpg altcaptured requests by fiddler a After receiving page request 4 browser tries to download styles for that page and sends request for it 5 which hangs forever. p  pInteresting thing, if I replay the same request using Fiddler 2  I will get the response 304 or 200 with no delay. Also, I can restart this particular app not whole IIS using IIS Manager and response will be send to hanged request 5. Also disabling header KeepAlive will prevent such hanging, but this can reduce performance. The hanging is not persistent but happens very often.p  pQuestion is what can cause such hanging If you have any thoughts please share them and I will check.p
