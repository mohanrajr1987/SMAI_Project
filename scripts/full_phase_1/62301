Positive 62301 pI serve a SPA over an office webserver node.jsexpress, but these static files doesnt came from a static public folder. The webserver gets signal from another server, that new a new client is downloadable. The office server get the archive and extracts it to a new folder name clientclientxxxxx.zipcontent. All new connections should use the new folder, but the old ones have to use the version they used at the first connection.p  pI think I have a problem with the identification of the same userconnection, because the SPA will be stateless and I cant change the statice files.

Positive 62301 pMy web app is handling large datasets that have to be returned to the user. So to speed up this process, when the data is new, the first user to access the data, triggers a caching script.  So the next user to access the data, will have the data be returned to the user in a 110th of the time.p  pThe issue is, the first user has to wait 30 odd seconds to generate the data, which during that time, the script runs and starts the caching process, the issue is, the browsers checks back keeping the connection alive by triggering a GET request again.p  pWhich triggers another cache event due to the fact the first one hasnt completed so the timestamp isnt there to say there is a cached version, so I can get multiple caching happening at the same time, due to the fact the first one hasnt finished.   p  pIs there a way to keep the connection open and not timeout, or not allow the browser to trigger multiple GET requests when one connection is taking a bit longer to respond p

Positive 62301 pIm writing my first serious MEAN application and have a problem with my routing. The basic setup works, I have a bunch of GET and POST routes that work perfectly.

I expect it to load script.js from codepublicscript.jscode but it tries to fetch it at codesomepagescript.jscodep  pWhat did I missp  pP.S. What Im really trying to achieve is to pass that codeuuidcode between pages. At page one, an angular controller has the codeuuidcode and the controller at somepage.html should also be aware of it. Is there a better way than passing it in the url The server doesnt need to know the uuid.p

The file saves to the temporary folder.p  pIve tried to res.sendreq.file, res.jsonreq.file, data binding the metadata in the controller scope, res.locals, middleware functions, and many other things that I cant even remember.

Positive 62301 hr  pWhile looking at the potential use cases for JQuery Deferred Promises, I came across Caching as one of the potential uses. That brought about the following question While using modern browsers and smart clients Jquery, any modern MVC, etc., do I even have to worry about caching anything myself I am working with MEAN stack and I am under the impression that caching does happen by default.  There is an Etag field in the headers that ensures that the server doesnt send the same information twice. The 2nd time, client will get 304 code with empty response body.  So are there any use cases out there requiring to manually implement caching on the front end  Thanksp

I want a list of all the products, and I want to know the quantity available of each product. The problem with the current answers is that they only return the products that we have sold or bought already. I want all the products.p

Negative 62301 pIm porting our old ActiveRecord based API over to a new structure to make unit testing easier etc. We are using the repository pattern for our data access and StructureMap for dependency injection.p  pIm struggling a little now with how to structure everything. Using our Product class as an example, we previously had our model, repository and factory parts all built into the product object, for example to load, edit and save a product we could something like simplifiedp  precodeDim p As New Product Ifp.Load1    p.Name  New Name    p.Save End If codepre  pAnd to get a collection of objects we had a Sharedstatic method on the object which acted as a basic factoryp  precodeDim arrProds  Product.GetProducts codepre  pAfter looking at a few examples, in our new structure we now have an IProductRepository, IProductService which is the factory and Product model class. So, something like thisp  precodeDim prodSvc  ObjectFactory.GetInstanceOf IProductService Dim prod  prodSvc.GetProduct1 Prod is an Instance of Product prod.Name  New Name prodSvc.Saveprod codepre  pHowever, the Product class has the ability to load related data, for examplep  precodeDim arrRelatedProds  prod.RelatedProducts codepre  pWhich inside the Product class looks like thisp  precodeClass Product     Function RelatedProducts As IListOf Product          prodSvc is an instance of IProductService which is passed into the           Product class in the constructor or via Dependency Injection         Return Me.prodSvc.GetRelatedProductsMe.ProductID     End Function End Class codepre  pI dont like this because its difficult to test and because I dont like the fact that my Model class Product calls the IProductService class directly.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions about a better way to structure all thisp  pCheersp  pJamesp  pstrongEDITstrong Probably the wrong time of year to ask this Is there any clarification I can add to make this question answerablep

Negative 62301 pI am trying to optimize a small, highly used function which uses the high bits in an unsigned short int to indicate the values of an array to sum together. At first I was using the obvious approach shown below. Please note that loop unrolling is not explicitly shown as it should be done by the compiler.p  precodeint total  0 forunsigned short mask  0x0001, j  0 mask  0 mask ltlt 1, j     if i amp mask         total  value[j]       codepre  pHowever, later I thought it might be better to remove the branching to help CPU pipelining and came up with the following.p  precodeint total  0 forunsigned short mask  0x0001, j  0 mask  0 mask ltlt 1, j     total  i amp mask  0  value[j]  codepre  pNote that since i amp mask does not result in a boolean answer, the comparison with 0 forces the result to be either 1 or 0. Although this second approach eliminates the ifstatement from this section of the code, the second solution needs to run a multiplication of 0 or 1 on every iteration in addition to the rest of the equation.p  pWhich code will run fasterp

Negative 62301 pShortly after upgrading our repository to Subversion 1.5, my team switched to writing a new application for a few months and then abruptly returned to our original codebase.

Our clients connect via svnssh.p  pOur original codebase integrates the SVN revision number into the code using codesvnversion ncode to query for the WCs current revision.

Sinnce java and others have provided for embedded comments what are the cases where they are useful I think I have a case but Id be interested to see others.p  pEDIT As noted below mikej the regex does not support the optional initial well and would be better asp  precode        String patternS  [AZaz]s[AZ].s[AZaz] codepre  pbut that would end up extracting space in the initialp

Negative 62301 pI got an email a few days ago from someone who was having trouble building a Delphi project I have on Google Code.  The project file and one of the DFM files were munged after he updated with some changes I had checked in.  We talked back and forth a bit, and traced it down to what he said was SVN throwing in extra stuff.  He deleted the files and ran Update again and it worked fine.p  pIve never seen this problem before, and I wasnt able to reproduce or verify any of it at my end.  There werent any update conflicts with other users, since Im the only one with write access to the repository.  So Im wondering what could have caused this.  Is this a known issue for SVN  Is there a way to keep it from happeningp

Negative 62301 pI mainly code small programs for myself, but recently, Ive been starting to code for my peers on my team. To that end, Ive started using a Mercurial repository to maintain my code in some form of version control specifically, TortoiseHg on Windows. I have many small scripts, each in their own directory, all under one repository. However, while reading a hrefhttphginit.com relnofollowJoels Hg Tutoriala, I tried cloning a directory for one of my bigger scripts to create a stable version and found I couldnt do it because the directory wasnt itself a repository.p  pSo, I assume and please correct me if Im mistaken that in order to use cloning properly, Id have to create a repository for each scriptdirectory. But.. would that be a good idea or a future maintenance nightmare waiting to happenp  pSuccinctly, do I keep all my unrelated scripts in one repository, or should I create a repository for each Or some unknown third optionp
Negative 62301 pI am looking for a properly distributed i.e. not just sharded and persisted not bounded by available memory on single node, or cluster of nodes keyvalue nosql store that does support range queries by primary key.p  pSo far closest such system is Cassandra, which does above. However, it adds support for other features that are not essential for me. So while I like it and will consider using it of course, I am trying to figure out if there might be other mature projects that implement what I need. Specifically, for me the only aspect of value I need is to access it as a blob. For key, however, I need range queries as in, access values ordered, limited by start andor end values. While values can have structures, there is no need to use that structure for anything on server side can do clientside data binding, flexible valuecontent types etc. For added bonus, Cassandra style storage journaled, all sequential writes seems quite optimal for my use case.p  pTo help filter out answers, I have investigated some alternatives within general domain like Voldemort keyvalue, but no ordering and CouchDB just sharded, more batchoriented and am aware of systems that are not quite distributed while otherwise qualifying bdb variants, tokyo cabinet itself not sure if Tyrant might qualify, redis inmemory store only.p  pEDIT Looks like hBase supports primary key range queries, and its data is distributed due to underlying hdfs. However I dont think it is fully distributed from system perspective, since region servers are just sharding key space but there is no redundancy assuming I did not misread documentation.p

Negative 62301 pFrom the docsp  blockquote   pIf you change the input value in a   validateerror method, you must   ensure that you only change the value   if it is invalid or uncoerced. The   reason is that, since the object and   context are now dirtied, Core Data may   validate that key again later. If you   keep performing a coercion in a   validation method, this can therefore   produce an infinite loop.p blockquote  pSo when I modify a value in a validation method, the context gets dirtied And the next time I save, the validation happens again  and when I change the value even if the validation is OK, then the context is again dirtied, and revalidated again  and I change the value, and Core Data validates, again, because the context is dirtied. And so on...for ever... is that right Or did they try to say something differentp

Negative 62301 pAt work, we use Perforce for version control.  There are problems with this 1 with this centralized model, we cant check in changes until they are ready for regression.

Negative 62301 pIm trying to find the source of a memory leak in a Compact Framework application using the Remote Performance Monitor. I managed to remove a few minor ones related to brushes and other graphic objects, but I still dont have a clear idea of what is causing the main problem.p  pAt this point the only objects that seem to never go back to their original count are System.String objects. I find this to be very weird, since I wouldve thought that in order for these objects to remain uncollected, the objects that contain them would have to remain as well, and yet no other type of objects seem to be increasing along with the System.Strings.p  pIm trying to find out which new String objects are the ones that remain after the application returns to its original state i.e. the login screen. The problem is that originally, the application loads with about 2200 string objects, and then after process X it increases another 70 or so which never get collected. I dont know how to identify those 70 new objects, in order to find out who is holding on to them and make the appropriate corrections.p  pDoes anyone have any experience in which Strings were not being collected Is there any way to separate the new objects created during process X from those that were originally required by the application so that I can know which are leaking Any advice would be appreciated.p  pThanks p  pUPDATEp  pOk... there is something very strange going on. Im starting to doubt whether there is a leak at all. p  pLets say that I take a memory snapshot at the Login screen which is the original starting point of the application. Imagine that there are 1000 string objects in memory at this point. Now, if I login and choose an option from the menu, Ill take a snapshot once the new screen is loaded. Lets say that loading this form increases the string count by say 50 objects. When I logout and take a snapshot again at the login screen, only 25 of those objects have been collected, the rest will stay in memory from then on.p  pThe strange thing is that if I keep repeating this process, no further string objects will accumulate. Instead of the string count increasing by 50, only 25 will be added at this point, and those same 25 will be collected once I go back to the login screen. Im thinking that if this were an actual leak, then each time that I opened that screen the string count would increase permanently by 25, but this only happens the first time. p  pThis happens to me on every new screen that I open. At first there is a small permanent increase in the overall string count, but once Ive loaded that particular screen, any increase in the string count during its execution will be collected once I go back to the login screen.p  pAll of this has led me to believe that perhaps those strings are part of the inner workings of the CLR or something like that. Could it be some sort of caching done by the runtime Perhaps it is storing my string constants for faster loading Something like that I hope this wasnt too confusing.p

Is there a better way to do this, i.e. move the code into a stand alone codeimport.rbcode file so it is only accessible from the console If so where would I need to put this file, in the codelibcode directoryp  pHere is a code snippetp  precodeclass AdminController lt ApplicationController      def import       f  File.openRails.rootpublicfeed.xml       doc  NokogiriXMLf       f.close        ignorelist  []  ignore list        doc.xpathproduct[notname  followingsiblingproductname].each do node         if ignorelist.include node.xpath.programName.innertext.strip           Product.createname gt cleanfieldnode.xpath.name.innertext.downcase,            description gt cleanfieldnode.xpath.description.innertext,           brand gt Brand.findorcreatebynamecleanfieldkeynode.xpath.brand.innertext.downcase,                    merchant gt Merchant.findorcreatebynamecleanfieldkeynode.xpath.programName.innertext.downcase,                image gt node.xpath.imageUrl.innertext.strip,           link gt node.xpath.productUrl.innertext.strip,           category gt Category.findorcreatebynamecleanfieldkeynode.xpath.CategoryName.innertext.downcase,           price gt   node.xpath.price.innertext.strip           print cleanfieldnode.xpath.name.innertext.downcase  n                end       end     end end codepre

Are there any posts youve made for how to use channelAPI efficiently I saw some stuff about reusing the tokens per user. Is there morep  pThanks again.p
Negative 62301 pI am working on my bc thesis project which should be a Minecraft server written in scala and Akka. The server should be easily deployable in the cloud or onto a cluster not sure whether i use proper terminology...it should run on multiple nodes. I am, however, newbie in akka and i have been wondering how to implement such a thing. The problem im trying to figure out right now, is how to share state among actors on different nodes. My first idea was to have an Camel actor that would read tcp stream from minecraft clients and then send it to load balancer which would select a node that would process the request and then send some response to the client via tcp. Lets say i have an AuthenticationService implementing actor that checks whether the credentials provided by user are valid. Every node would have such actoror perhaps more of them and all the actors should have exactly same database or state of users all the time. My question is, what is the best approach to keep this state I have came up with some solutions i could think of, but i havent done anything like this so please point out the faultsp  pSolution 1 Keep state in a database. This would probably work very well for this authentication example where state is only represented by something like list of username and passwords but it probably wouldnt work in cases where state contains objects that cant be easily broken into integers and strings. p  pSolution 2 Every time there would be a request to a certain actor that would change its state, the actor will, after processing the request, broadcast information about the change to all other actors of the same type whom would change their state according to the info send by the original actor. This seems very inefficient and rather clumsy. p  pSolution 3 Having a certain node serve as sort of a state node, in which there would be actors that represent the state of the entire server. Any other actor, except the actors in such node would have no state and would ask actors in the state node everytime they would need some data. This seems also inefficient and kinda faultnonproof.p  pSo there you have it. Only solution i actually like is the first one, but like i said, it probably works in only very limited subset of problems when state can be broken into redis structures. Any response from more experienced gurus would be very appriciated. Regards, Tomas Hermanp

What is happening is that when i click on a row in the ListView and the Style trigger fires to select the ListViewItem the row is selected.  When i click the Delete button the onclick fires but the CurrentPosition property is set to 1.  What is preventing the CurrentPosition property from being updated. p  pXAMLp  precodeltWindow xClassPretzelsUI.Admin.Ovens     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     Title      Height344      Width474      mcIgnorabled      xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008      xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006      xmlnsmyclrnamespacePretzels.ModelassemblyPretzels.Model     ResizeModeNoResize     WindowStartupLocationCenterOwner     BackgroundStaticResource WindowGradient            LoadedWindowLoadedgt ltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltCollectionViewSource xKeyovenViewSource dDesignSourcedDesignInstance myOven, CreateListTrue gt ltWindow.Resourcesgt ltGrid DataContextStaticResource ovenViewSourcegt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition HeightAuto gt         ltRowDefinition HeightAuto gt         ltRowDefinition HeightAuto gt         ltRowDefinition HeightAuto gt         ltRowDefinition HeightAuto gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt     ltBorder Grid.Row0 BorderBrushStaticResource formTitleBorderBrush BorderThickness2 Nameborder1 CornerRadius30 Padding7 BackgroundStaticResource formTitleBackgroundBrush VerticalAlignmentCenter Margin11gt         ltTextBlock NametextBlock1 TextOvens FontSize18 FontWeightBold ForegroundStaticResource formTitleForegroundBrush gt     ltBordergt     ltListView IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItemTrue ItemsSourceBinding NameovenListView SelectionModeSingle Height177  Grid.Row1 TabIndex2 Margin5,5,5,0gt         ltListView.ItemContainerStylegt             ltStyle TargetTypeListViewItemgt                 ltSetter PropertyControl.HorizontalContentAlignment ValueStretch gt                 ltSetter PropertyControl.VerticalContentAlignment ValueStretch gt                 ltltStyle.Triggersgt                     ltTrigger PropertyIsKeyboardFocusWithin ValueTruegt                         ltSetter PropertyIsSelected ValueTrue gt                     ltTriggergt                 ltStyle.Triggersgtgt             ltStylegt         ltListView.ItemContainerStylegt         ltListView.Viewgt             ltGridViewgt                                     ltGridViewColumn xNamenameColumn HeaderName Width100gt                     ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                         ltDataTemplategt                             ltTextBox Margin6,1 TextBinding PathOvenName, ModeTwoWay, ValidatesOnExceptionstrue, NotifyOnValidationErrortrue, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged WidthAuto gt                         ltDataTemplategt                     ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                 ltGridViewColumngt                 ltGridViewColumn xNamedescriptionColumn HeaderDescription Width300gt                     ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                         ltDataTemplategt                             ltTextBox Margin6,1 TextBinding PathOvenDescription, ModeTwoWay, ValidatesOnExceptionstrue, NotifyOnValidationErrortrue WidthAuto MaxLength100gt                         ltDataTemplategt                     ltGridViewColumn.CellTemplategt                 ltGridViewColumngt             ltGridViewgt         ltListView.Viewgt     ltListViewgt     ltStackPanel Grid.Row2 NamestackPanel2 Margin0,30,0,0 OrientationHorizontal VerticalAlignmentCenter HorizontalAlignmentCentergt         ltButton ContentNew Height23  Margin2,0,2,0 TabIndex3 NamebtnAdd Width75 ClickbtnInsrtClick gt         ltButton ContentSave Height23 Margin2,0,2,0 TabIndex4 NamebtnSave Width75 ClickbtnSaveClick gt         ltButton ContentDelete Height23 Margin2,0,2,0 TabIndex5 Namebtndelete Width75 ClickbtndeleteClick gt     ltStackPanelgt ltGridgt codepre  pp  pCp  precode public partial class Ovens  Window      private PretzelEntities dbcontext  new PretzelEntities     private OvenCollection EntityData     private CollectionViewSource ViewSource     private BindingListCollectionView OvenView      public Ovens              InitializeComponent           private void WindowLoadedobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              ViewSource  CollectionViewSourcethis.FindResourceovenViewSource          ViewSource.Source  from s in dbcontext.Ovens select s         OvenView  BindingListCollectionViewViewSource.View            private void btndeleteClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e                  if OvenView.CurrentPosition gt 1                              if MessageBox.ShowDo you really want to delete this Oven, Delete Confirmation, MessageBoxButton.YesNo  MessageBoxResult.Yes                                      this.OvenView.RemoveAtthis.OvenView.CurrentPosition                                           else                              MessageBox.ShowNothing to Delete., Error, MessageBoxButton.OK                       enter code here codepre  hr  pI think what is happening is that when the trigger fires the CurrentItemCurrentPosition of the ListCollectionView is not being properly updated.

Negative 62301 pIm working on creating a dashboard. I have started to refactor the application so methods relating to querying the database are generic or dynamic.p  pIm fairly new to the concept of generics and still an amateur programmer but I have done some searching and I have tried to come up with a solution. The problem is not really building the query string in a dynamic way. Im fine with concatenating string literals and variables, I dont really need anything more complex. The bigger issue for me is when I create this query, getting back the data and assigning it to the correct variables in a dynamic way.p  pLets say I have a table of defects, another for test cases and another for test runs. I want to create a method that looks something likep  precodepublic void QueryDatabaseltTgtref ListltTgt Entitylist, Listltstringgt Columns, string query where T Defect, new codepre  pNow this is not perfect but you get the idea. Not everything about defects, test cases and test runs are the same but, Im looking for a way to dynamically assign the retrieved columns to its correct variable.p  pIf more information is needed I can provide it.p

Negative 62301 pIm using VS 2008 Pro amp iTextsharp version 5.1.1.p  pI have a set of about 30 pdfs. Ive managed to use iTextSharp to iterate over all of them and get the export values for the check boxes on the various forms. Some have an export value of On while others have an export value of Yes. Im trying to find a way to programmatically set the export value of the checkboxes to On so they are all in sync. This is all in an effort for another app that exports pdfs and will sometimes need to mark a checkbox as checked. That application is actually using CeTes Dynamic Pdf software and the company has some right out on the forums and said their software cannot get the export value of a radio button or chexkbox. With CeTes software, you mark a checkbox as checked by setting the checkboxes value to the export value. Thats a rather large catch however, if I can use iTextSharp to normalize the exportvalue for all chexkboxes, I can side step this issue.p  pAnyone have any thoughtsp  pBtw, here is the code Im using to get the ExportValues. It might not be great, but its functional and intended as a one off program.p  precode    using System     using System.Collections.Generic     using System.Linq     using System.Text     using System.IO     using iTextSharp.text.pdf      namespace iTextSharpTesting1              class Program                      static void Mainstring[] args                              Console.WriteLineApp Path   LogUtil.logFile                  DirectoryInfo formsFolder  new DirectoryInfoCDevelopmentForms                 string path  string.Empty                 int onCount  0                 int yesCount  0                 StringBuilder lines  new StringBuilder                   if formsFolder  null ampamp formsFolder.Exists                      foreach FileInfo fi in formsFolder.GetFiles.pdf                                              lines.AppendLine File Name   fi.Name                           PdfReader reader  new PdfReaderfi.FullName                         int counter  0                         using FileStream fs  new FileStreamTest Out.pdf, FileMode.Create                                                      PdfStamper stamper  new PdfStamperreader, fs                             AcroFields fields  stamper.AcroFields                              foreach string key in fields.Fields.Keys                                                              iTextSharp.text.pdf.AcroFields.Item i  fields.Fields[key]                                 bool x  fields.SetFieldPropertyCheckBox1, exportvalue, On, null                                                             string[] states  fields.GetAppearanceStateskey                                 if states.Count gt 0                                                                      lines.Append Field   key  t   State Values                                      foreach string s in states                                                                              ifon.Equalss.ToLower                                              onCount 1                                         else if yes.Equalss.ToLower                                              yesCount  1                                          lines.Appends  ,                                                                          lines.Appendn                                                                                            fields.RenameFieldoldFieldName, newFieldName                             stamper.Close                             LogUtil.WriteStatic Void Main, lines.ToString                             lines  null                             lines  new StringBuilder                                                                Added after I noted all ExportValues for the checkboxes seem to be either Yes or On.

The code used in that question has several PdfDictionary types declared. Its also in java, but thats not a big deal. The problem is that there is no Keys property on the PdfDictionary class for the code Im using. Ive checked the PdfDictionary class in the source project for itextsharpsrccore5.1.1 and there is very clearly a public property on this class called Keys. Intellisense amp the compiler dont seem to see it and Ive no idea why. p  pObviously the goal here is that Im trying to iterate over the dictionary and get the values for the various keys, but Im a bit stumped on how to do that without having access to the Keys in the dictionary used. Granted, Ive checked the pdf reference the question linked and found it rather informative. More than likely, the key names will be something like, PdfName.D, PdfName.Yes, PdfName.N, but having an actual list of keys is the best way to figure this out. Any thoughtsp
Negative 62301 pIm having a very strange problem that may be the result of my ignorance of how Applescript handles variable names. Ive written a script that works fine on my computer.  It references variables from the dictionaries of a couple of programs, Ill use an example from Numbers here since its better known.  On my computer, the following works finep  precodetell application Numbers activate tell document 1 tell sheet 1 delete table 1 codepre  pWhen the same script is loaded into another computer it looks like thisp  precodetell application Numbers activate tell document 1 tell ltltclass NmShgtgt 1 delete ltltclass NmTbgtgt 1 codepre  pAnd, of course, it cant find codeltltclass NmShgtgtcode.p  pAny suggestions Numbers automatically comes up with document 1 and sheet 1, and using those variable names works correctly on my computer.p

Negative 62301 pIm a newbie in WPF. Ive implemented an MVVM solution and implemented INotifyPropertyChanged for all properties that need to reflect on the UI. Everything seems to be working ok so far, except for a listbox bound to a readonly property which returns an observable collection.p  pViewModelBase implements the INotifyPropertyChanged interfacep  precodepublic abstract class ViewModelBase  INotifyPropertyChanged      .....     INotifyPropertyChanged Implementation     .....      OnPropertyChanged...              .....         codepre  pMainViewModel class inherits ViewModelBase and holds the data for the UI View. A BackgroundWorker creates the UserViewModel objects. The objects are added to the ObservableCollection. The ListBox displays the UserViewModel ObservableCollection.p  pAs and when the User object is created it is added to the ObservableCollection and OnPropertyChanged is called to notify the UI elements to refresh. This works ok.p  pWhen user selects to view Favorites only, one User item from view is removed. Checking amp Unchecking the checkbox has the same effect... that is, an user item is removed from the list view. While the expected behavior is to switch between the observable collections.p  precodepublic class MainViewModel  ViewModelBase          private ObservableCollectionltUserViewModelgt mUsers  new ObservableCollectionltUserViewModelgt     private ObservableCollectionltUserViewModelgt mFavoriteUsers  new ObservableCollectionltUserViewModelgt     UserViewModel mSelectedUser     private bool mbShowFavorite      public bool ShowFavorite              get  return this.mbShowFavorite          set                      this.mbShowFavorite  value             OnPropertyChangedShowFavorite             OnPropertyChangedUsers                    public UserViewModel SelectedUser              get  return this.mSelectedUser          set                      this.mSelectedUser  value             OnPropertyChangedSelectedUser                    public ObservableCollectionltUserViewModelgt Users              get                       if this.mbShowFavorite                 return this.mFavoriteUsers             else                 return this.mUsers                    .....

Negative 62301 pIm trying to write a custom trace listener for Enterprise Library Logging which sends all log messages to an arbitrary WCF endpoint.

Negative 62301 pWhen writing exception safe code, it is necessary to consider the exception safety guarantee none, basic, strong or nothrow of all the functions called. Since the compiler offers no help, I was thinking that a function naming convention might be helpful here. Is there any kind of established notational standard indicating the level of exception safety guarantee offered by functions I was thinking along the lines of something hungarianlikep  precodevoid setFooBFoo constamp s  B, offers basic guarantee int computeSomethingS     S, offers strong guarantee int getDataNT throws    NT, offers nothrow void allBetsAreOffN       N, offers no guarantee codepre  pEdit I agree with comments that this kind of naming convention is ugly, so allow me to elaborate on my reasons for suggesting in. p  pSay I refactor some code, and in that process, change the level of exception safety offered by a function. If the guarantee has changed from, say, strong to basic justified perhaps by improvement in speed, then every function that calls the refactored function must be reconsidered for their exception safety. If the change in guarantee triggered a change in the function name as well, it would allow the compiler to help me out a little bit in at least flagging all uses of the changed function. This was my rationale for suggesting the naming convention above, problematic as it is. This is very similar to const, where a change in the constness of a function has cascading effects on other calling functions, but in that situation the compiler gives very effective assistance.p  pSo I guess my question is, what kind of work habits have people developed in order to ensure that code actually fullfills their intended exception guarantees, especially during code maintenance and refactoring.p
Negative 62301 pSuppose I have a CMS application written in Node.js which persists data on a Redis database. When this application creates a new content, it should increment the id counter, add the new id to a list of ides and then set a new hash with content. What I would do for now is to create a function to perform this execution. This function let us call it codecreateArticlecode would have a callback and would execute the increment. Once the increment was executed, a callback function would push it into the list of ids. After that, another callback would create the hash. The hashcreating callback would call the function passed as parameter to codecreateArticlecodep  precodefunction createArticletitle, content, callback      var client  redis.createClient     client.incridCounter, functionerr, id          if err return callbackerr, data         client.lpusharticleIds, id, function err, data              if err return callbackerr, data             var key  articleid             client.hmsetkey, title, title, content, content, callback                codepre  pI would use this function more or less this way using Express in this examplep  precodeapp.postcreatearticle, functionreq, res      var title  req.body.article.title,          content  req.body.article.content     createArticletitle, content, functionerr, data          if err return res.rendererror,  status 500, message Internal Server Error          res.renderindex,  status 200, message Article created        codepre  pHowever, this code looks a bit cumbersome to me. Is this the way to go. Or is there a better way to do a series of IO steps I used Express and Redis in my example, but the answer do not need to use them.p

Negative 62301 pIm writing a web application with some ACL requirements a user can make changes to some items, some items may be editable by several users, administrator can edit anything and a manager can edit everything within her organization etc. p  pIm using the Play framework, and by the looks of the codeSecurecode module, it seems that the place to put authorization concerns is in the Controllers. However, it seems to me that the authorization issues are part of the business logic, and therefore should be in the model. Furthermore, Im starting to see duplicated logic in the controllers that I need to refactor out.p  pOn the other hand, adding authorization to the model means that Id have to have some way of getting the current user from within the model, which doesnt seem right. Alternatively, I could add a currentuser parameter to every model method, but that seems even worse.p  pSo what is the common practice Canshould I put authorization code in the model, or keep it in the controllerp

This code will definitely trigger an integer division by zero error at runtime.p  pIMO such cases when the compiler knows that the code will divide by zero at all times are worth a compiletime error  the Standard doesnt prohibit that. That would help diagnose such cases at compile time instead of at runtime.p  pHowever I talked to several other developers and they seem to disagree  their objection is what if the author wanted to divide by zero to... emm... test error handlingp  pIntentionally dividing by zero without compiler awareness is not that hard  using codedeclspecnoinlinecode Visual C specific function decoratorp  precodedeclspecnoinline void divide int what, int byWhat       if whatbyWhat          rand        void divideByZero      divide 0, 0   codepre  pwhich is much more readable and maintainable. One can use that function when he needs to test error handling and have a nice compiletime error in all other cases.p  pAm I missing something Is it necessary to allow emission of code that the compiler knows divides by zerop

Negative 62301 pIm running into a strange issue, I hope someone can help. p  pIn my iOS app I create a video with a custom soundtrack using codeMutableCompositioncode by combining a video from the users photo library and an audio file from the app bundle. I then use an codeAVPlayercode and codeAVPlayerItemcode to play the video back to the user using a custom video player I made.p  pEach time a new composition is created, the assets, the player and the composition are cleared, released and it basically starts from a clean, init state. p  pAll works fine, until after exactly 4 successful videos created this way every other attempt to create the player fails with error codeCannot Decodecode. It does not matter if its the same video Im recreating, has no relation to the sizelength of the video or the audio file it simply always fails exactly on the fifth attempt, like clockwork. Once it fails, it will then always failp  pThis is weird, because it just decoded the same video four times with no problem, so all of a sudden it fails So, if anyone has a clue, please let me know.p

If there is a solution in another language however, I would like to hear it.p  pI realize that this sounds almost sort of backwards, but to make a long story short I have to make this com library work on Mac.

I am using cocos2dx in an iOS env for nowp  pI am building a game, where I have to read strings potentially German, French, etc. from a text file and display them in labels.p  pI started, using standard ifstream to read the file and everything worked fine for pure english text.

Negative 62301 pLets say we are executing lots of different sql command, and the codeSqlCommand.CommandTimeoutcode was leave with default value 30 seconds. p  pAnd lets just assume some of those sql command are just long query and we might get the timeout exception. p  pCorrect me if Im wrong, this exception was just cause .Net do not want to wait anymore, but if we are using connection pool, this connection might be remain open, so will that sql statement might still running on the SQL server side Or there are some hidden communication between those system to suddenly stop it no matter we are using connection pool or not p  pJust want to know whats the mechanism and would it effect the SQL server performance. I mean if the query is really long such as take 10 mins to run if its still running it might just slow down the server unnecessary as no one can get the result.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo here Im asking about the connection pool specifically, its definitely that the code will close the connection with exception handling, or we can just assume that are using code which is a pattern preferred named by dash here. The problem is if I call the Close or Dispose method on that SqlConnection object, it is returned to the connection pool, its not physically close it.p  pIm asking when its returned to pool, would that long query still running on SQL Server side. And if possible, how to avoid that.p  pstrongUPDATE againstrongp  pThanks for dash mentioning that about database transaction, yes a rollback will make it wait and we are not closing the connection and return it to the pool yet. So what if its just a long select query or an update but just one individual update without any database transaction involved And specifically I want to know is there a way that we can tell SQL Server that I do not need the result now please stop running itp

Negative 62301 pObjC has a very unique way of overriding methods. Specifically, that you can override functions in OSXs own framework. Via categories or Swizzling.

Negative 62301 pI have a Windows batch script  that I use to build a module and the script in turn uses the ClearCase codeclearmakecode command to drive the actual compilations, directory creations and file manipulations, i.e. process the Makefile content.  The batch script works flawlessly when invoked using a DOS window or from a cmd c ... command line invocation.  And it has been that way for some number of years.p  pI recently decided to move the script to Ant.  The first step, out of simplicity, was to simply invoke the script unchanged using an emExecem task using codecmd ccode.  Almost immediately, Ant fails while creating a directory.  The error message reports something like p  pcodemkdir Cannot create the directory Cfredharryjoecodep  pI was able to verify that, using the DOS command prompt, the codemkdir Cfredharryjoecode command works fine, so, as near as I can tell so far, Ant generating double backslash path separators combined with something inherent to codeclearmakecode andor something in the Makefile is causing the failure.p  pThe response Im looking for is something along the lines Yes, codeclearmakecode is definitely the culprit because... or If you twiddle this thing or that thing in Ant, only a single backslash will be generated....

Negative 62301 pA little in disbelief Java makes it this easy on the client side. I was convinced I was going to have to post an image over to a server file to sanitize it first, but I also want to keep anyone from accessing a server file like that and thinks a little and ends up spamming me with pics. I need the process strict with no potential tampering by the end user.p  pFrom what I read if I understand it right, a PUT should be just what I need. A signed ja of mine sends a site related informational image from client to server without exposing any of my FTP info or revealing a upload file that can be attacked. Do I have the right grasp of PUT is my question I guess.

The sensors are place though out a house in the walls and ceiling. I have a Revit plans of the house and this is where I am having difficulties.

Negative 62301 pI have a DataTable which will contain about couple thousand rows, each row has about 20 fields. p  pIn addition, the values in cells will change live. Also some rows will get deleted and some added while running.p  pstrongThe first problemstrong Im facing is that when I have the app open and call DataGrid.DataSource  .. The DataGrid doesnt show data at first, I have to minimize the app and then bring it back on for data to show up, why is this happeningp  pstrongThe second problemstrong is that each row will be updated from a separate thread. I kept getting Index Corrupted Exception and then I found out I cant update dataTable from seperate threads, therefor I created a class with all the cells, created List and made threads update the class data directly and then another single thread updates the dataTable, that seemed to work fine, but is there a better way of doing thisp  pBasically I need a DataGrid, that supports couple thousand rows which are going to be updatedremovedadded live by threads, not user. What is the best way to accomplish this p  pThanksp

Negative 62301 pSo I know theres a lot of questions regarding this, but so far as I can tell this is a unique situation so I figured I would post it.  Hopefully, this will add some info that may finally give us an answer as to why this is happening to us.  Im getting the error waitfences failed to receive reply 10004003, when my device rotates.  The animation of my views are initiated from p  pcode void willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervaldurationcodep  pIm only getting the error on the new iPad 3.  Ive used the exact same program on an original iPad and iPhones as low as a 3GS.  They all dont get the waitfences error and they all rotate faster than the iPad 3 does.  p  pI use Core Graphics almost exclusively to draw the views.  I also ensure theyre redrawn on a resize so I dont get pixilated views.  If I disable the redraw on resize, I dont get this error but I get stretched views.  If I disable core graphics drawing altogether I dont get the error but, of course, I get black views.  p  pI used the Time Profiler and found out that the hangup was primarily in drawing gradients img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgb4TP.png altenter image description herep  pI have altered the code to fill rather than draw gradients and that does alleviate the problem.  I would say that the gradients are the problem except I do these animations in other situations other than in response to rotation and it works just fine.  p  pI would also like to note that Ive paid special attention to making sure I only animate views that are actually on the screen.  I know that animating views off screen can sometimes cause this error to occur.p  pI have not included the animation codep  pAny ideas as to why this is happening  Especially since its only happening on the iPad 3p  pFor those who will ask, this is the code that performs the animation.

Negative 62301 pI do not know how best to put it so the title is little vague. Let me explain what I am doing. I want to write a kind of sync service in python and it should have modules for each operation. p  pThere needs to be a central daemon managing generic operations like logging, storing data to db etc. p  pThere needs to be sub processesdaemons forked from parent processindependent processes which can communicate with central daemon and can exchangesend data to be stored in db. Each process is different and contacts different servers and fetches different set of data. They also need to be separate modules so they cancannot be installed p  pDepending on the submodules availability the central daemon will manage these subprocesses.  p  pAlso these subprocesses needs to act as serversay working on socket 3333 for a gui which will interact it to display whatever changes these subprocesses make, by fetching it from central daemon. p  pNow I dont know if this is goodbadpathetic design.

However, this event object isnt a specific one i.e., sometimes the e is a touchstart, touchmove, or touchend and therefore itd be easier if I could get a general cloning function instead of just hardcoding the specific properties.

Negative 62301 pstrongProblemstrongp  pAssume there is a set of different functions. Each of there functions may be a member function of some object, and may take an arbitary number of arguments. For simplicity sake lets assume that each function has no more than 8 arguments of codeintcode, codedoublecode or codestdstringcode types. For examplep  precodeclass MyClass public   void DoAint i   void DoBdouble d, int i   class YourClass public   void DoCstdstring s   void DoDint i1, int i2, int i3  codepre  pLets assume there is a file containing a series of records about functions.

class to pick a DataSet enum that only loads the data it needs. Its specified like thisp  precodepublic enum DataSet      NONEcreate,     COREcreatecore.xml,     USERScombinecreateusers.xml, CORE,     TAGScombinecreatetags.xml, USERS, codepre  pCould this be causing it to run slower rather than faster The idea is that if I only want the core xml languages, provinces, etc., I only have to load those records. I thought this would make the test suite faster, but its still too slow.p  pstrongI can save some time by creating a separate xml dataset specifically designed for each test class. This chops out some of the insert statements. But even when I have 20 insert statements in a single xml dataset thus, the minimum IO loss other than inlining the dataset right into java code directly, each test still takes .1 to .15 seconds during the initialization of the database datastrong I am in disbelief that it takes .15 seconds to insert 20 records into memory.p  pIn my other project using Spring 3.0 and Hibernate 3.x, it takes 30 milliseconds to insert everything before each test, but its actually inserting 100 or more rows per test. For the tests that only have 20 inserts, they are flying as if there was no delay at all. This is what I expected. Im starting to think the problem is with Springs annotations  or the way I have them setup in my codeDatabaseTestcode class. This is basically the only thing different now.p  pAlso, my repositories are using the sessionFactory.getCurrentSession instead of the HibernateTemplate. This is the first time I started using the annotationbased unit test stuff from Spring, since the Spring test classes are deprecated. Could that be the reason they are going slowp  pIf theres anything else you need to know to help figure it out, please let me know. I am sort of stumped.p  pEDIT I put in the answer. The problem was hsqldb 2.2.x. Reverting to 2.0.0 fixes the problem.p
Negative 62301 pIm working on a project with Scala, Salat, Casbah, Mongo, Play2, BackboneJS... But its quite a lot of new things to learn in the same time...

When I use the DataTable search filter to filter the results and I search for all dropdowns that have the selected value of Open, nothing changes. p  pI believe this is happening because every dropdown in the table has the same options and the filter is searching on them and returning all results, since they all match.p  pHow can I get the filter to search on only the selected value and not all options of the dropdownp  pI have tried to find a solution, but all I can find are results like these p  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9616841dropdownfilterjquerydatatablesDropdown filter jquery datatablesali lia hrefhttpjquerydatatablescolumnfilter.googlecode.comsvntrunkcustomFilters.html relnofollowCustomFilterali ul  pThese all deal with adding custom filters for each column, I just want to use the existing DataTable filter.p  h3Exampleh3  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net575L81 relnofollowLive example of the problema, Search for Open or Closedp  h3Codeh3  precodelttablegt         lttheadgt             lttrgt                 ltthgtNameltthgt                 ltthgtStatusltthgt             lttrgt         lttheadgt         lttbodygt             lttrgt                 lttdgtltinput namename typetext valueNeed more memory idname1gtlttdgt                 lttdgtltselect namestatus idstatus1gt                         ltoption value2gtClosedltoptiongt                         ltoption selectedselected value1gtOpenltoptiongt                     ltselectgt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttdgtltinput namename typetext valueCant connect idname2gtlttdgt                 lttdgtltselect namestatus idstatus2gt                         ltoption selectedselected value2gtClosedltoptiongt                         ltoption value1gtOpenltoptiongt                     ltselectgt                 lttdgt             lttrgt         lttbodygt lttablegt codepre
Negative 62301 pI am using MySQL ConnectorNet 6.5.4 with LINQ to entities, and I frequently get terrible query performance because the entity framework generates queries that use derived tables.p  pHere is a simplified example of what Ive encountered several times. In C, I write a query like thisp  precodevar culverCustomers  from cs in db.CustomerSummaries where cs.Street  Culver select cs  later... var sortedCustomers  culverCustomers.OrderBycs gt cs.Name.ToList codepre  pInstead of generating simple a query like thisp  precodeSELECT cust.id FROM customersummary cust WHERE cust.street  Culver ORDER BY cust.name codepre  pThe entity framework generates a query with a derived table like thisp  precodeSELECT Project1.id FROM      SELECT cust.id, cust.name, cust.street FROM customersummary cust     WHERE Project1.street  Culver  AS Project1  here is where the EF generates a pointless derived table ORDER BY Project1.name codepre  pIf I explain both queries I get this for the first queryp  precodeid, selecttype, table, type, possiblekeys, rows 1,  PRIMARY,     addr,  ALL,  PRIMARY,       9 1,  PRIMARY,     cust,  ref,  PRIMARY,       4 codepre  p... and something awful like this for the entity framework queryp  precodeid, selecttype, table,      type, possiblekeys, rows 1,  PRIMARY,     ltderived2gt, ALL,                 9639 2,  DERIVED,     addr,       ALL,  PRIMARY,       9 2,  DERIVED,     cust,       ref,  PRIMARY,       4 codepre  pNote the first row, where MySQL explains that its scanning strong9000 recordsstrong.

Negative 62301 pMy application extracts large amounts of geometry data. I use Eclipselink 2.4.1 to persist that data in a MySQL database.

Negative 62301 pPerformance and security considerations aside, and assuming a hash function with a perfect avalanche effect, which should I use for checksumming blocks of data CRC32 or hash truncated to N bytes I.e. which will have a smaller probability to miss an error Specificallyp  ol liCRC32 vs. 4byte hashli liCRC32 vs. 8byte hashli liCRC64 vs. 8byte hashli ol  pData blocks are to be transferred over network and stored on disk, repeatedly. Blocks can be 1KB to 1GB in size.p  pAs far as I understand, CRC32 can detect up to 32 bit flips with 100 reliability, but after that its reliability approaches code1232code and for some patterns is much worse. A perfect 4byte hash reliability is always code1232code, so go figure.p  p8byte hash should have a much better overall reliability code264code chance to miss an error, so should it be preferred over CRC32 What about CRC64p  pI guess the answer depends on type of errors that might be expected in such sort of operation. Are we likely to see sparse 1bit flips or massive block corruptions Also, given that most storage and networking hardware implements some sort of CRC, should not accidental bit flips be taken care of alreadyp

Negative 62301 pI have the following modelp  precodeclass Hospitalmodels.Model     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength200     authorizedusers  models.ManyToManyFieldUser codepre  pDisplaying a filterhorizontal widget on the Hospital admin page to manage the ManyToManyField is pretty simplep  precodeclass HospitalAdminadmin.ModelAdmin     filterhorizontal  authorizedusers,   admin.site.registermodels.Hospital, HospitalAdmin codepre  pHowever, what Id REALLY like is to display that widget AS WELL on the Change User admin page, inline with the rest of the Users information. It stands to reason that ManyToManyFields SHOULD be modifiable from both directions  to authorize multiple users for a single hospital, the above defacto situation is fine. However, to authorize one user on multiple hospitals, the current situation would require visiting the admin page for each hospital and selecting the one user in question  absurd.p  pI will add that I AM using the UserProfile methodology to store additional info about users what type of user they are, etc. One POSSIBLE solution would be to make the Hospitals ManyToManyField reference UserProfile instead of User. Then I could add a codeManyToManyFieldHospital, throughHospital.authorizedusers.throughcode to codeUserProfilecode, thus allowing me to add the filterhorizontal widgets to both ends. However, this is nonideal since itd be a pain later to reference the connection. Imagine I want to get the first user authorized for a given hospital. Rather than codehospname.authorizedusers.all[0]code, Id have to do something like codehospname.authorizedusers.all[0].usercode. Im not even sure how Id accomplish the equivalent of codehospname.authorizedusers.allcode to get the full list as that would return a list of codeUserProfilescode, not codeUsercodes.p
Negative 62301 pRecently I finished reading Designing with Progressive Enhancement by the Filament Group. In the book they talk about providing two levels of support based on testing browser features. If the browser passes the tests it gets the enhanced experience which is built on top of the basic. If the browser fails, it just gets the basic experience. On paper this makes perfect sense and really drives home that this is how websites should be built. p  pAfter I finished the book I looked at enhance.js which is a script they go over in the book that tests browser features a hrefhttpsgithub.comfilamentgroupEnhanceJS relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfilamentgroupEnhanceJSa and the new version since the book a hrefhttpsgithub.comfilamentgroupenhance relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfilamentgroupenhancea. In the script, there isnt a way to test for specific css features like I expected. Sure, youre able to test for boxmodel support, but what if my layout relies on display table Is there anyone testing for features like this Is it even practical to do so p

Negative 62301 pHopefully someone may know what I mean and where I may find such a thing.p  pIm creating a new website and as part of it ill be offering mobile web design.  What I need if possible, is something that, should a user click on one of my examples, it load up a mobile browser not the mobile site on a normal web browser.  More like an emulator that will allow them to see working examples of potential sites.p  pIs there anything out there that will do this, or am I looking at opening a new window to a set size and displaying the site within itp  pPlease Note  Whilst writing this out, I may have stumbled across a potential floor, as this may expose code.p  pIm thinking I should perhaps consider putting JPEGs or PNGs that they can scroll through so not to expose the code behind the mobile site itselfp  pIf there is such an emulator or the likes that is available and doesnt show code in the background id be more than happy to be pointed in the right directionp  pThanks Paulp

Negative 62301 pIn our application we deal with data that is processed in a worker thread and accessed in a display thread and we have a mutex that takes care of critical sections. Nothing special.p  pNow we thought about reworking our code where currently locking is done explicitely by the party holding and handling the data. We thought of a single entity that holds the data and only gives access to the data in a guarded fashion.p  pFor this, we have a class called GuardedData. The caller can request such an object and should keep it only for a short time in local scope. As long as the object lives, it keeps the lock. As soon as the object is destroyed, the lock is released. The data access is coupled with the locking mechanism without any explicit extra work in the caller.

Negative 62301 pWe have a strange problem.  We are upgrading JDE and the database schema is changing  some char columns are changing to nchar types.  However, we have found that some of the searches are no longer working, and we have found this to be consistent across our SQL Server 2008 databasesp  pIn the DB that I tested, the ItemNumber column is a char25 and has varying length contents.p  precodeSELECT  FROM TableName WHERE ItemNumber LIKE S codepre  preturns a bunch of rows.  However, if we change the column to an nchar25 that query now only returns those rows that have an ItemNumber value ending in S emandem are 25 characters long, so it seems that trailing spaces are now being possibly correctly taken into account  if you change the wildcard value to S  it finds 24 character item numbers ending in S.p  pObviously, this is quite an issue for us as S searches no longer work in JDE, as the underlying database calls now need every nchar column to be trimmed.  Is this a known issue, or a setting somewhere that we need to changep  pemAdditional Informationem We dont have any control over the column types used, nor can we change the underlying SQL generated, as this is part of our ERP system and its upgrade.  We have logged a call with Oracle, but as far as I am aware they havent seen this, nor can they replicate it but we dont know under what circumstances they are trying to do this, plus the fact that it happens across our other databasesservers makes me wonder if it isnt an obscure setting, somewhere.p

Negative 62301 pI have an interface, codeResourcecode, which is supposed to wrap emsomethingem and expose a few operations on the wrapped object.br My first approach was to write the following, with the strongStrategystrong pattern in mind.p  precodeinterface ResourceltTgt      ResourceState read     void writeResourceState   abstract class AbstractResourceltTgt implements ResourceltTgt       This is where the Strategy comes in.     protected AbstractResourceResourceStrategyltTgt strat           ...

My idea of usage by the client, would bep  precodeResourceManager rm  ... MyCustomObject o  ... MyCustomReadWriteStrategy strat  ... rm.newResourceForo, id, strat codepre  pThis way, the client would know about resources, but wouldnt have to deal directly with resources hence the packageprivate classes. Also, I could make my own implementation of some common resources, like sockets, and the client would only ask for them emieem, I would have to write a codeSocketStrategy implements ResourceStrategyltSocketgtcode.p  precodeResourceManager rm  ... rm.newSocketResourceid, host, port codepre  pTo access resources, he would request an handler from the manager. This is due to each thread having some specific access privileges, and so the manager would create an handler with the appropriate access privileges.p  precode This is in the ResourceManager class. public ResourceHandler getHandlerForString id      if canThreadUseThisResourceid throw ...     if isThreadReaderOnly           return new ResourceReadHandler ...       else           return new ResourceWriteHandler ...        codepre  pThis is where the problem kicks in.br This approach seems emclean and clearem to me, it also seems to be intuitive for the user.

Negative 62301 pI have a custom UITableViewCell which contains a UIButton and the cell itself responds to UIControlEventTouchUpInside.  The cell behaves as it should in the iPhone simulator and all versions of the iPhone EXCEPT for the iPhone5.  For some reason, on the iPhone5, the cell only responds to touches at the very bottom of the cell.  In fact, it is extremely difficult for the user to actually get the cell to respond to a touch, they have to tap many times near the bottom of the cell in order to get it to respond.  Also, the UIButton simply does not respond at all on the iPhone5.  I should also add that this error only started occurring AFTER the app was optimized to fit the iPhone5s larger retina screen. Im inclined to believe that this has something to do with the sizing of the cell, but its appearance on the iPhone 5 looks exactly as it should.  I also tried fixing this problem by creating a seperate NIB to instantiate when an iPhone5 is being used which takes advantage of the Autolayout Interface Builder feature, but this solved nothing.p  pHere is the code that instatiates the Custom UITableView cell in the ViewController.mp  precode Configure the cell... switch indexPath.section      case 0                  Full name               UINib nib  [UINib nibWithNibNameProfileNameCell bundlenil]          cell  [[nib instantiateWithOwnernil optionsnil] objectAtIndex0]          [[ProfileNameCell cell nameLabel] setText[NSString stringWithFormat ,                                                       [[[Engine sharedInstance] currentUser] firstname],                                                       [[[Engine sharedInstance] currentUser] lastname]]]          [[ProfileNameCell cell imageButton] addTargetself                                                   actionselectorselectUserPhoto                                         forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]           if [[[Engine sharedInstance] currentUser] photoURL]  nil              [ProfileNameCell cell setImageForURL                 [NSURL URLWithString[[[Engine sharedInstance] currentUser] photoURL]]]                   break     ... codepre  pAnd here is the code for the View.mp  precodeimplementation ProfileNameCell  synthesize imageViewimageView synthesize imageButton synthesize nameLabel   voidawakeFromNib      [CALayer [self.imageView layer] setCornerRadius5.0]    idinitWithStyleUITableViewCellStylestyle reuseIdentifierNSString reuseIdentifier   self  [super initWithStylestyle reuseIdentifierreuseIdentifier]  if self       Initialization code.

Negative 62301 pUsing Visual Studio 2010, WinForms, and VB.Net, I am trying to use one form as a User Settings page Form2 that contains a Theme variable for Form1. Basically after a user enters a different theme name which will eventually be a dropdown list into the user settings and clicks the save button, I want Form1 to be redrawn or reloaded with the new theme settings.p  pI have tried to use refresh, hideshow Form1, recall the formload event, and many other things. I have looked online for a method to redraw or unloadreload the form1 with the new theme setting, but I havent found anything that works and will change the color settings of form1 once the user saves the user settings on form2.p  pAccording to the logic and the documents I have read, one of these options should work, but none of them change the background color of the form1. I have tried calling the ColorChange on load event, on shown event, etc.p  pI dont want to use the Color Dialog because I dont want the user to select individual colors. I want them to choose from a selection of predesigned themes that are saved in the user settings. This is only a test project so you can let me know the good and bad about doing it this way while suggesting other ways to do it, but I would much rather understand the reason that none of these options work and figure out a way to make it work if it is possible.p  h3Form1h3  precodeDim selectedTheme As String  My.Settings.Theme  Sub ColorChange     Select Case selectedTheme         Case Desert             Me.BackColor  Color.Brown         Case Default             Me.BackColor  Color.Black             lblErrorMsgs.ForeColor  Color.Red     End Select  End Sub codepre  h3Form2h3  precodePrivate Sub btnSaveSettingsClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnSaveSettings.Click     My.Settings.Theme  txtTheme.Text     My.Settings.Save      Form1.Refresh     Form1.Show      Me.Hide  End Sub codepre
Negative 62301 pI am looking for a way to monitor the sent status of a MMS message started by codeIntent.ACTIONSENDcode so that I can return to my original activity upon the message being sent. Currently Im using  codestartActivityForResultcode with a request code to start it so theres something to return and display a toast with and Im also using codeIntent.putExtraexitonsent, truecode so that it exits the default messenger and returns to the original activity when the Send button is pressed but that only gives the illusion that it sent the message and doesnt actually monitor and wait for it to be sent. I have found examples that monitor sms messages that use the codesmsManagercode, pending intents, and broadcast receivers, but being a noob Im uncertain if thats the approach I should use. Any guidance would be appreciated.p

Negative 62301 pBinding a decimal to a UITextField does not let you put a . in, as you type 1., the push to source strips it out. I get why it happens, MakeSafeValue converts it to a decimal, which gets read back out without the ., overwriting the Text entered. This seems like a keyup vs onblur issue, which a lot of binding frameworks let you override.p  pI know I could bind a string on the view model instead, but handling the EditingDidEnd instead of EditingChanged seems better. That way I could intercept ShouldEndEditing to check validity.p  pWhere would I register my binding to override the MvvmCross implementation I tried adding in my Setup.FillTargetFactories, but it is called before MVXTouchBindingBuilder.FillTargetFactories where the MvvmCross one is.p  pI tried a different property name, in FillTargetFactories I havep  precoderegistry.RegisterPropertyInfoBindingFactorytypeof UITextFieldTextDidEndTargetBinding, typeof UITextField, DidEndText codepre  pbut it does not work when I bind.p  precodeset.BindtextField.ForDidEndText.Tovm gt vm.GMoney codepre  plooks like MvxPropertyInfoTargetBindingFactory.CreateBinding does not work if the target does not have that property  makes sense.

Negative 62301 pWe use dotconnect for Oracle and have three schemas Master, Staging and Prod in our database. We have three SSDL files, one corresponding to each schema.

Negative 62301 pI am working on a hover dropdown panel, containing the Google, Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter social widgets listed for visitors to oneclick each of them without the panel closing.p  pI started with simple jquery dropdown menu, simplified it down to a single ul li div, so on mouseover of a single menu item Socialize, it displays a div containing all 4 social widgets. So far so good. as long as you hover over the single menu item or the div that contains the 4 social widgets, it remains visible, and moving outside the div causes it to hide. p  pThe issue I am having, is that the Google widget has a Follow button, which on mouseover, opens its own small drop menu to select which circle you wish to choose. when this Google drop menu appears, the parent div loses focus for lack of a better term, and the containing div hides.

What could slowing this down I am sure it is dependent on the application associated with the object Any ideas to speed it up, even a little Thanks.p

Negative 62301 pIm trying to use Matisse in NetBeans to create a simple game...like Myst.  I just want it to display a Frame that has things like a text field and buttonsinventory on the right.  I can do that.  Then I created a Jpanel that displays on the Frame.  Ive input some pictures and created a set of cards to make visible and invisible when needed.  Each cardscene needs to have buttons that will be different for each scene. Basically I want to make transparent buttons for the user to press that do things i.e. move to next picturescene, find a key, etc....  I can create different buttons in each picture, but I cant seem to move them anywhere.  I have a suspicion its due to Matisse, but I dont know.  p  pHere is some of the code, Im sure its crude as its my first implementation of anything in Java. At the very bottom in the Scene to display Ive added a button, that displays.  I pretty much know now that the setBounds wont work due to the way position works...how would I then place it somewhere.  Right now it just displays at the top mid of the picture.p  pSceneFrame  p  precode   To change this template, choose Tools  Templates   and open the template in the editor.   package main import scene.SecondPanel import scene.FirstPanel import scene.Scene import javax.swing.JButton    public class SceneFrame extends javax.swing.JFrame         private FirstPanel sceneP     private SecondPanel sceneSP            Creates new form SceneFrame           public SceneFrame                  initComponents         addCards                 public void addCards          sceneP  new FirstPanel         SceneManager.addSecondPanel, sceneP                        sceneSP  new SecondPanel         SceneManager.addFirstPanel, sceneSP         sceneP.setVisiblefalse                   This method is called from within the constructor to initialize the form.

Negative 62301 pI am trying to set up a minecraft server, for fun, and want to add a control panel to make managing it easier. Part of this control panel is to run the server FROM the panel to reduce missclicking the exit button and whatnot. the minecraft server is a nonrunnable .jar file, implying you have to make a .bat to run it from the command line I know how to run the server inside my program, as well as print the output, herep  precodeProcessBuilder pb  new ProcessBuilderjava, jar, gscale.jar         pb.redirectErrorStreamtrue         pb.directorynew FileFDocuments and SettingsAdministratorDesktop          System.out.printlnDirectory   pb.directory.getAbsolutePath         Process p  pb.start         InputStream is  p.getInputStream         BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderis         for String line  br.readLine line  null line  br.readLine                  System.out.println line   Or just ignore it                  p.waitFor codepre  pbut, with this, im not sure how to implement an input method. for example, if I click a button, it sends the input stop to the external jar to stop the server, as it does without this command panel. how would I implement that the code above I plan to be running in its own thread, but maybe im doing this all wrongp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 62301 pI am following the book emOpenGL SuperBible Sixth Editionem, and they work with C there, however I prefer to program in Java, I am doing quite good at mapping all functions, LWJGL is after all pretty straight forward, however now I have some concerns.p  pGiven the following code in Cp  precodeGLuint buffer  buffer id glGenBuffers1, ampbuffer   generate an unique id glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, buffer  bind buffer glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, 12  4, NULL, GLSTATICDRAW    allocate data on GPU void ptr  glMapBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, GLWRITEONLY    obtain memory pointer on GPU memcpyptr, data, sizeofdata    copy data, which is an array of float[] glUnmapBufferGLARRAYBUFFER done with copying codepre  pI made this Java codep  precode    abId  glGenBuffers     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, abId     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, ByteBuffer.allocateDirect12.asFloatBuffer, GLSTATICDRAW      FloatBuffer data   declares FloatBuffer object     data  glMapBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, GLWRITEONLY, 12  4, null.asFloatBuffer   gets FloatBuffer to which we can write, allocate 12 floats  4 [float length]     data.put0.25f.put0.25f.put0.5f.put1.0f             .put0.25f.put0.25f.put0.5f.put1.0f             .put0.25f.put0.25f.put0.5f.put1.0f put data, NOT backed by array     glUnmapBufferGLARRAYBUFFER unmap the buffer codepre  pEverything seems pretty straightforward, I circumvent using an array of codefloat[]code by the codeFloatBuffercode, this is not as important yet, but I wanted to know that I could get that technique to work.p  pHowever emoneem thing concerns me, that is that I cannot pass codeByteBuffernullcode as second argument into codeglBufferDatacode, as LWJGL gets a codeNPEcode then.br So Ive decided to allocate a buffer without elements, does this still follow the C idiom of putting codeNULLcode into there Are there any performance concerns regarding this Java version vs the C versionp
Negative 62301 pI had a customer reporting problems with a file in a specific path. Debugging some old Windows code, I have found that the code in question that fails is a call to StgOpenStorage. The path in question that fails has an emdash. If I take this emdash out by renaming the file, then the call to StgOpenStorage succeeds.p  pSo my question is this is this a known limitation with this function Are there likely to be other Windows SDK functions that fail with special characters like emdash I noticed there is a call to mbstowcs prior to calling this function, which makes me wonder if the problem is due to the codepage mapping the emdash character incorrectly. The wchar path looks okay in the Visual Studio debugger prior to the call, so it seems weird that the function would fail on a path that the system allows.p

Negative 62301 pI have a few different ways of upload entire directories to Amazon S3 within my application depending on what options are selected.  Currently one of the options will perform an upload of multiple directories in parallel.  Im not sure if this is a good idea as in some cases it sped up the upload and other cases it slowed it down.  The speed up appears to be when there are a bunch of small directories, but it slows down if there are large directories in the batch.  Im using the parallel ForEach loop seen below and utilizing the AWS APIs codeTransferUtility.UploadDirectoryAsynccode method as suchp  precodeParallel.ForEachdirs,myParallelOptions,                     async dir gt  await MyUploadMethodAsyncdir  codepre  pWhere the codeTransferUtility.UploadDirectoryAsynccode method is within codeMyUploadMethodAsynccode.  The codeTransferUtilitycodes upload methods all perform parallel uploads of parts a single file if the size is big enough to do so, so performing a parallel upload of the directory as well may be overkill.  Obviously we are still limited to the amount of bandwidth available so this might be a waste and I just should just use a regular foreach loop with the codeUploadDirectoryAsynccode method.  Can anyone provide some insight on if this is bad case for parallelizationp

I wait, then retry. The second request now creates another folder called demo 1 as the original folder is in drive. It seems that even though there is an error sometimes the request goes though.p  pIve created a fix that in the event a create fails it will look in Google Drive to see if the folder has been created. That seems to stop the issue from happening but can make the application a bit slow.p  pMy question is has anyone experienced this and what would be the best way to handle this error. Perhaps I should not implement binary backoff at all and just assume every create will succeedp

Negative 62301 pI am currently trying to implement a matrix multiplication in ARM assembler. I already read some tutorials about matrix calculations in assembler and they all use the NEON instructions on a 3x3 or 4x4 float matrix. But thats totally different to what i want to do. I have two symmetrical int matrices, so row and column number of both matrices are the same and my assembler function gets the size of the matrices as parameter, so i cant write a matMul function for just 3x3 or 4x4 matrices like in the tutorials. p  pSo my question is what is the best and easiest way to do that Is it even possible to use the NEON instructions with a 100x100 or even bigger matrix And also the single and doubleprecision registers are unnecessary, because i only have int numbers. p  pAnother problem is, that Im almost totally new to ARM assembler and so i dont understand the NEON instructions completely.p

Negative 62301 pIm playing with augmented reality in javascript using a hrefhttpsgithub.comchiliepflchilitags relnofollowChilitagsa. Im trying to make a 3D transformation of HTML elements, transformed with CSS3, a bit like a hrefhttpwww.mrdoob.comlabjavascriptthreejscss3dperiodictable relnofollowThree.jss CSS3d demoa, but simpler.p  pTo do so, I detect the 3d  transformation of tags, given in the form of a 4x4 matrix. For each transformation, I create a code.tagcode div containing a simple text and a background, which I transform using CSS transformmatrix3d... directive.p  pAll these code.tagcode divs are contained in a codecameracode div, which is supposed to apply the projection transform. This is where I am stuck. I do not manage to find a transformmatrix3d... that makes the code.tagcode divs overlap exactly the barcodes in the image.p  pSo far, my closest result is with a code   1   0 0 0   0   1 0 0   0   0 1 0 320 240 0 1 code projection matrix that translates the tag divs, but does not take their depth into account. The result is shown in this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUdqu5 relnofollowjsFiddlea, where I hard coded the transformation matrices of the tags in the background sample snapshot.p  pI also tried with a projection matrix used to draw the tags in other demo with three.js. This matrix is a regular perspective transform, but it does not seem to work at all here. This matrix is the one commented out in the CSS.p  pI would really appreciate if someone could help me find a way to match the code.tagcode divs on the tags on the image, i.e. cover the barcodes with the purple quadrilaterals in the jsFiddle.p

Negative 62301 pI am very new to cryptography and I need some expert suggestions to deal with my scenario. Also forgive my ignorance.p  pI need a way to encrypt a file and give it to receiver. The receiver can decrypt the file and read the content but should not be able to change it. Sort of like a license file.p  pFrom the knowledge i got reading about encryption for the past 2 days PGP encryption is that file can be encrypted using a public key and the receiver can only decrypt using their private key. If the reviver has the private key then I am guessing they could change the content of the file as well p  pIn my case the receiver should be able to decrypt using public key only read the content and not change it and the private key should stay with the sender. Is this scenario possible Would signing the file with senders private key helpp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 62301 pAt first I thought my program had memory leaks.  But I terminated all java processes and restarted Spring Tools Suite.  I kept an eye on the task manager.  In just a few minutes, javaw.exe had grown to 2,000,000 K Memory.  The memory keeps going up, without issuing commands in STS.  STS has literally ONLY been opened.  I have no tabs open in it.  The error log doesnt show any memory related errors.  Upon closing STS javaw.exe DOES disappear from task manager and opening STS restarts the process over again around 150,000K, quickly jumping to 600,000K, then slowly growing and growing until it has consumed all my memory.  p  pAny thoughts what might be causing this Im running a full system scan now just in case Ive been compromised.p  peditp  pThis problem started around 10 AM Eastern and mysteriously went away at noon, when the security scan completed.

Negative 62301 pIm working on converting an existing Drupal site to Pyramid. The Drupal site has urls that are SEO friendly example testsite.comthisisapageaboutprogramming. In Drupal they have a system which maps that alias to a path like testsite.comnode33 without redirecting the user to that path. So the user sees testsite.comthisisapageaboutprogramming but Drupal loads node33 internally. Also if the user lands on testsite.comnode33 they would be redirected to testsite.comthisisapageaboutprogramming.p  pHow can this be achieved in Pyramid without a major performance hit p

The problem Im hitting it accessing I can create this session in my base code, but I cant seem to access it from within the login processing function. Ive been searching for about two hours, but Im just not sure what to look for at this point. If anyone can give me a sample of how to access the facebook objects within the function that are initialized globally, I can likely handle the rest from there.p  pEDIT It was a simple enough solution, just something I wasnt familiar with. When calling the object you need to express the namespace as well.

Negative 62301 pIve tried several combinations but have not found one yet that will display gracefully without adding unneeded scrolls bars.  p  pI have a page that displays a Navigation column and then a content column.  In the content column I am displaying a PDF in an IFrame.  The left hand column is fixed at say 150px.  I need the the right hand column to consume the rest of the width of the page and all of the height of the page.  For some reason when the IFrame is put in the right hand div grows by about 5px and it adds an additional scroll bar that just mucks things up.

Negative 62301 pSo I recently migrated to Android Studio from Eclipse. For the most part, its better, but I havent found a good way to maintain a shared codebase between multiple projects.p  pWhat I want to do is be able to share some code between several of my applications. Each application is in its own project. From what Ive seen, most people add it as a library module in the applications project. The problem with that is the module is accessible from only one project. The other projects within which my other applications reside cant access the library.p  pIt seems to me like there should be a mechanism for creating another library project and then allow each of the application projects to access that code. This worked in Eclipse, where I would create another project in my workspace, mark it as a library, and then have the other projects reference it. I would be able to change the code in the library and then all of the projects referencing it would automatically build with the updated code.p  pIs this something I could do in Android Studiop

Negative 62301 pIm attempting to use a highcharts in conjunction with Bootstrap. The pie chart is placed inside a column of 6 for example, so it takes up half the page. What has been happening is the datalabels are too long and so are being cropped out of the containing div. A fix that has been proposed for this is to set a width on the datalabels. like sop  precodepie              size 60,             allowPointSelect true,             dataLabels                style                 width100                  colorblack                                           codepre  pThis works flawlessly for Chrome and mozilla, the width is set and the position of the datalabel changes so its all drawn closer to the pie chart. But when testing in IE8, and I have to account for it unfortunately the width is set, but it appears that the position of the datalabel is not changing, so I get even less of the data label visible on the screen.p  pIll try get a jsfiddle or a screenshot up shortly so you can see what I mean, but initially I was just seeing if anyone had come across this issue before, or if theres a simple fix I am just missing.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net4Fd8X relnofollowJsfiddleap  pIve commented out the width in the plot options so you can see whats happening.  When I uncomment the width, it renders perfectly in Chrome and mozilla. But in IE8, the position of the label doesnt change, so the left labels end up far away from the pie chart and still cropped.p

Negative 62301 pIve been writing an RPG game engine for Android, and Ive gotten to the point that I think I need to add a scripting language for my Battle Engine. Its just too complex to get by on XML configuration driving the game content, like Ive been doing previously. It seems like LUA is the scripting language of choice by the game development community, so Ive been doing some research. Since the Engine is written in Java, Im thinking about using LuaJ as my LUA interpreter, since I found some old threads that indicate its probably the best Java LUA interpreter, but if anyone has a more current opinion on a better interpreter, Im all ears.p  pAnyway, I need to be able to call a LUA script from Java, and continue game thread execution without waiting for the script to return. Is this possible with LuaJ or any other popular Java based interpreter I know I could always put the script call in its own thread, but I could potentially have many scripts active at once, and its a waste, since I dont need a return value anyway.p

Negative 62301 pI am using Ace Editor to build a code replay program. I store all the keys pressed when you type code, and then I replay them in Ace Editor. I have finished storing and replaying all keyboardmouse input, but am having issues replaying tab presses.p  pAce Editor handles tabs within a textarea DOM. The default behavior for a textarea when tab is pressed is to move to the next DOM, so I know they are using preventDefault and using their own handler in order to allow softTab insertion of 1,2,3, or 4 spaces before all highlighted text.p  pMy goal is to cause Ace editor to trigger the tab event  such that whatever is currently highlighted in the Ace editor is tabbed over the correct number of spaces. Does anyone know how to do thisp  pHere are a list of options Ive tried and why they dont workp  ol liStore tab presses on keydown and then calculate the column value and insert the spaces in that location. BUT  this fails when you have some text half highlighted. The correct functionality should shift the entire word over, but this would just insert spaces in the middle of the word.li liStore the location and keys pressed whenever editor.onchange, someeventhandler fires, which gives me exactly what was input and the location perfect for replay except it doesnt tell me whether tab or spacebar was pressed it will fire for both and spacebar is already handled. Plus this still inserts spaces at the location potentially in middle of a word instead of shifting word over as in number 1.li ol  pFor examplep  precodeeditor.getSession.onchange, functione      if handlers          var text  e.data.text         if text     text      text       text                   FAILS because it doesnt know if its space or a single space tab. codepre  ol liTry to trick Ace Editor to trigger a tab by storing t and inserting it into the ace Editor.li ol  pFor example storage codep  precodefunction keypresshandlere      var key  e.which     var text  String.fromCharCodekey     switchkey          case 9 Tab             text  t  manually add tab             Code to store this event for replay later             break              codepre  pFor example replay codep  precode Assuming the cursorselection is in the correct position editor.insertlog.text codepre  pAt this point, I was beginning to think about building tab from scratch when to shift multiple things if multiple lines are selected, how far to shift, how to handle if a word is half highlighted when tab is pressed, but Ace clearly already does this when tab is pressed, so I would like to just trigger the tab press. Normally to trigger a tab press, Id simply dop  precode trigger an artificial Tab Keydown event for Ace Editor using jQuery var tabpress .Eventkeydown tabpress  9  Tab keycode .editor.triggertabpress codepre  pBut this causes results in no behavior. Any suggestionsp

Negative 62301 pI have used an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22786090jquerymultiplecheckboxfilteringearlier posta and with success implemented this as a 2dimensional product viewer with filtering.p  pAs I really appreciate the people developing and sharing this code. p  pI would like it to be possible for the selections to be preserved when clicking back from a product Maybe its possible to get the selections showed as variables in the URL when a checkbox is checked, so in that way you can click back to the same selectionp  pAnother thing, I have tried to add a series of radio buttons, that has nothing to do with the actual checkboxes or jQuery, but for some reason the jQuery reacts to the radio buttons when clicked. Are there any way to disable this Even if the radio buttons are untouched, when filtering with the existing checkboxes, it behaves wrongly by hiding everything when supposed to show everything.p

Negative 62301 pIm trying to get into game dev with SpriteKit for iOS, and Im following a book called strongiOS Games By Tutorialsstrong by emRay Wenderleichem. p  pRight now Im working on a platform game, but Im getting some weird results when trying to do something not in the book.p  pBasically I have a functioning platform game that loads the level from a JSONfile, and lays out bricks nodes in a background layer. I want to have  multiple strongfloorsstrong, so when a user jumps through a portal in the game, a new floor level is loaded and placed on screen in the exact same position all floors are the same size. p  pI didnt think I would have any troubles with this, as being notified when the user jumps through the portal is really easy. And Im already loading a level to begin with, so loading another one at this time and replacing the original one shouldnt be hard.p  pHowever, its proving to be very difficult. strongWhen the game loads I call this methodstrongp  precode voidcreateWorld    bgLayer  [self createScenery[NSNumber numberWithInteger1]]    worldNode  [SKNode node]   [worldNode addChildbgLayer]   [self addChildworldNode]    self.anchorPoint  CGPointMake0.5, 0.5   worldNode.position  CGPointMakebgLayer.layerSize.width  2, bgLayer.layerSize.height  2  codepre  pThis initializes a level floor 1 from a JSON file, which basically is just a number of 32x32 nodes positioned next to each other forming a map. It then creates a codeworldNodecode, adds the codebgLayercode to the codeworldNodecode, and then adds it to the screen. Later it centers the codeworldNodecode on the screen. The codeworldNodecode is the node that moves when the player moves, the codebgLayercode is always stationary. p  pstrongWhen the user jumps through a portal, I call this methodstrongp  precode voidgoingUp    if isChangingFloor return     isChangingFloor  YES    [bgLayer removeFromParent]   bgLayer  nil   [worldNode removeFromParent]   worldNode  nil    bgLayer  [self createScenery[NSNumber numberWithInteger0]]   worldNode  [SKNode node]   [worldNode addChildbgLayer]   [self addChildworldNode]    worldNode.position  CGPointMakebgLayer.layerSize.width  2, bgLayer.layerSize.height  2  codepre  pThis method wasnt always this full, as I thought I could just replace codebgLayercode with the new one. That didnt work, so now Im trying to reset everything, to replicate what happens in the codecreateWorldcode method at start. However, this doesnt work either... p  pstrongThis is the result I get after jumping through the portalstrong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comA9zKD.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, theres 1 node onscreen, however the debuginfo says there are 446. I believe this is the total number of nodes on the entire floor, but only around 90100 should be visible at a time. Ive tried adding removing nodes from the level, which increases decreases this number.p  pSo as you all probably can understand, Im really confused. Why doesnt it simply replace the old background with a new one when I jump through a portal Theres nothing wrong with the JSONfile itself, as Ive tried loading codefloor0code in at start, and that works fine. Why isnt the behavior the same when jumping through the portal as when I initially load the game What is different here Why does it say 446 nodes onscreen when theres clearly only 1. Why is there only 1 node on the screenp  pIve been stuck on this for several days now, and I would really appreciate any help that would get me closer to a solution. Thanks in advancep

Negative 62301 pI am new to browserify and its usage is not completely clear to me although the benefits seem to be compelling.p  pI have a couple of questions and was hoping someone could clarify.p  ol lipIve seen blog posts about using browserifyshim in the package.json to include third party libraries like jquery and bootstrap. Ive also seen posts where tools like gulp are used generate the bundle file.  I cant seem to find a good answer on why browserifyshim is required if tools like gulp are able to automate the process. Can someone please shed some light Why is browserifyshim even required I feel the gulp solution is a little cleaner although a little more involved. It wont pollute package.json with browserify specific stuff that is a build thing and therefore goes together with gulp just my personal opinionpli lipHow does one deal with third party libraries that are not in npm and also not public For example, we purchase a script from a third party. That script is not any common js, but is a regular js file with some dependencies example, on jquery and underscore.pli ol

Right now I try to pass MyFile.h into my clprogram using the method clCreateProgramWithSource.p  pIf I run this on the device as is it would work fine because openCL has built in math functions. However, if I want it to run on the host, I need to include cmath or another library in order to define sqrt, sin, etc. But then if I include cmath so that it works on the host, it would no longer be able to run on the device because openCL cant includeimport cmath.p  pSo I cant seem to find a way to define it once and use it in both places. If the host werent dependent on cmath to get those math functions it would not be an issue, but currently I dont know what to do.p

Negative 62301 pIve written a small Ruby library that lets me generate parsers using the parsing expression grammar formalism but with a few extra extensions. Currently I can composegenerate parsers dynamically at runtime by using a pretty simple API, e.g.p  precodeg  Grammar.rules do   rule start, mabc end codepre  pThe above grammar will match the string codeabccode and return an object representing the matched results. There are the obvious ways of composing parsers with sequencing codegtcode, alternation codecode, negativepositive lookahead codecode, semantic actions codegtgtcode, etc. Most of these parsers can be compiled in advance in an obvious way by simply compiling the component parsers and then gluing them together with the proper control flow. As a concrete example,p  precodeg  Grammar.rules do   rule start, mabc gt mdef end codepre  pcan be compiled top  precodeclass CompiledGrammar     def self.startcontext       seq1  matchabc, context       if seq1.nil         return nil       end       seq2  matchdef, context       if seq2.nil         return nil       end       return [seq1, seq2]     end end codepre  pSimilar expressions work for alternation, positivenegative lookahead, and semantic actions but there is one extension that Im not quite sure how to compile. The extension deals with using information from the current parsing process to generate another parser on the fly, e.g.p  precodeg  Grammar.rules do   rule start, ma.many[a] gt dynamicgtcontext       mb  context[a].length     end codepre  pThe above grammar will match as many codeacodes as possible and then will match an equal number of codebcodes by dynamically generating a parser that has just the right number of codebcodes.p  pI know that I can make this work if I include the entire library in the compiled output but is there a better way to do this that does not involve falling back on the existing runtimep

Negative 62301 pIm currently working implementing AI to one of my iOS games a hrefhttpsitunes.apple.comusappzatackaonlineid898553383mt8 relnofollowhttpsitunes.apple.comusappzatackaonlineid898553383mt8a. I found out that potential feels would be the best solution for this. The potential field consist of a 568320 grid. The potential feild can have a value from 50 to 50 where negative value attracts and positive value repulsate. However my problems occurs when the moving objects worms in the game dynamically updates and intereract. This code below uses sinus and cosines to calculate a point to the right a and left of every time the worm moves. Then it checks for the current potential field value stored in a bitmap. If is the value returned is lt the value that is considered to be set, set it to that value. Is this a ideal way to combine two potential fields Seems to me like its to trivial. Also is linear calculation useful or should i calculate the distance between another reference point. Sorry im new to Ai and i would be vary thankful for a explanation.p  precodefor int i   bigsizeYellow62 i lt 50 i          float x3  xpointForwardcosf1point2MPI2i         float y3  YpointForwardsinf1point2MPI2i         if x3 gt 0 ampamp y3 gt 0 ampamp x3 lt 320 ampamp y3 lt 568              int c  [paint getValueAtRowy3 andColumnx3]             if c lt 50i  [paint getValueAtRowy3 andColumnx3]  0                  [paint plotPointCGPointMakex3, y3 withAlpha50i]                 ifc gt 0                  [paint setValueAtRowy3 andColumnx3 withValue50i]                                                 for int i  bigsizeYellow62 i lt 50 i          float x3  xpointForwardcosf1point2MPI2i         float y3  YpointForwardsinf1point2MPI2i         if x3 gt 0 ampamp y3 gt 0 ampamp x3 lt 320 ampamp y3 lt 568               int c  [paint getValueAtRowy3 andColumnx3]             if c lt 50i  [paint getValueAtRowy3 andColumnx3]  0                  [paint plotPointCGPointMakex3, y3 withAlpha50i]                  ifc gt 0                  [paint setValueAtRowy3 andColumnx3 withValue50i]                                          codepre

Negative 62301 pSo lately, I read on an issue regarding the three distinct types in C, charunsigned charsigned char. The problem that I now encounter is not something I have experienced up till now my program works correctly on all tested computers and only targets littleendian basically all modern desktops and servers using WindowsLinux right. I frequently reuse a char array I defined for holding a string not a real string of course as temporary variables. E.g. instead of adding another char to the stack I just reuse one of the members like array[0]. However, I based this tactic on the fact that a char would always be signed, until I read today that it actually depends on the implementation. What will happen if I now have a char and I assign a negative value to itp  precodechar unknownsignedness  1 codepre  pIf I wrotep  precodeunsigned char A  1 codepre  pI think that the Cstyle cast will simply reinterpret the bits and the value that A represents as an unsigned type becomes different. Am I right that these CStyle casts are simply reinterpretation of bits I am now referring to signed lt unsigned conversions.p  pSo if an implementation has char as unsigned, would my program stop working as intended Take the last variable, if I now dop  precodeif A  1 codepre  pI am now comparing a unsigned char to a signed char value, so will this simply compare the bits not caring about the signedness or will this return false because obviously A cannot be 1 I am confused what happens in this case. This is also my greatest concern, as I use chars like this frequently.p

Negative 62301 pin the past I have written some java programs, using two threads.  First thread producer was reading data from an API C library, create a java object, send the object to the other thread. The C API is delivering an event stream infinite. The threads are using a LinkedBlockingQueue as a pipeline to exchange the objects put, poll.  The second thread consumer is dealing with the object. I also found that code is more readable within the threads. First thread is dealing with the C API stuff and producing proper java objects, second thread is free from C API handling and is dealing with the data.p  pNow Im interested, how I can realize this scenario above with the new stream API coming in java 8. But assuming I want to keep the two threads producerconsumer First thread is writing into the stream. Second thread is reading from the stream. I also hope, that I can handle with this technique a better explicit parallelism producerconsumer and within the stream I can use some implicit parallelism e.g. stream.parallel.p  pI dont have many experience with the new stream api. So I experimented with the following code below, to solve the idea above.p  ul liI use generate to access the C API and feed this to the java stream.li liI used in the consumer thread .parallel to test and handle implicit parallelism. Looks fine. But see below.li ul  pQuestionsp  ol liIs generate the best way in this scenario for the producerli liI have an understanding problem how to terminateclose the stream in the producer, if the API has some errors strongANDstrong I want to shutdown the whole pipeline. Do I use stream.close or throw an exception ul li2.1 I used stream.close. But generate is still running after closing,  I found only to throw an exception to terminate the generate part. This exception is going into the stream and consumer is receiving the exception  This is fine for me, consumer can recognize it and terminate. But in this case, the producer has produced more then consumer has processed, while exception is arriving. li li2.2 if consumer is using implicit parallelism stream.parallel. The producer is processing much more items. So I dont see any solution for this problem. Accessing C API, check error, make decision.li li2.3 Throwing the exception in producer arrives at consumer stream, but not all inserted objects are processed.li ulli ol  pOnce more the idea is to have an explicit parallelism with the threads. But internally I can deal with the new features and use parallel processing when possiblep  pThanks for breeding about this problem too.p  precodepackage sandbox.test  import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger import java.util.stream.LongStream  public class MyStream      private volatile LongStream stream  null     private AtomicInteger producerCount  new AtomicInteger0     private AtomicInteger consumerCount  new AtomicInteger0     private AtomicInteger apiError  new AtomicInteger0      public static void mainString[] args throws InterruptedException      MyStream appl  new MyStream     appl.create           private static void sleeplong sleep      try          Thread.sleepsleep      catch InterruptedException e          throw new RuntimeExceptione                private static void apiErrorfinal String pos, final int iteration      RuntimeException apiException  new RuntimeExceptionAPI error pos  pos   iteration  iteration     System.out.printlnapiException.getMessage     throw apiException           final private int simulateErrorAfter  10      private Thread produce      Thread thread  new Threadnew Runnable          Override         public void run          System.out.printlnProducer started         stream  LongStream.generate gt              int localCount              Detect error, while using stream.parallel processing             int error  apiError.get             if  error gt 0                  apiError1, error               Accessing the C API here              localCount  producerCount.incrementAndGet  C API access delegate for accessing the C API               Accessing the C API here                Checking error code from C API             if  localCount gt simulateErrorAfter    Simulate an API error                 producerCount.decrementAndGet                 stream.close                 apiError2, apiError.incrementAndGet                          System.out.printlnP   localCount             sleep200L             return localCount                      System.out.printlnProducer terminated                   thread.start     return thread           private Thread consume      Thread thread  new Threadnew Runnable          Override         public void run          try              stream.onClosenew Runnable              Override             public void run                  System.out.printlnClose detected                          .parallel.forEachl gt              sleep1000             System.out.printlnC   l             consumerCount.incrementAndGet                       catch Exception e               Capturing the stream end             System.out.printlne                  System.out.printlnConsumer terminated                   thread.start     return thread           private void create throws InterruptedException      Thread producer  produce     while  stream  null          sleep10     Thread consumer  consume     producer.join     consumer.join     System.out.printlnProduced   producerCount     System.out.printlnConsumed   consumerCount        codepre

Negative 62301 pI am trying to figure out how to implement Server side listeners for a Java based SFTP server to alert me to an incoming file transfer. Im using the latest version of Apache Mina. My scenario is for my server to simply receive a file from a client and do something to the file before storing it. That something could be error checking  rules validation  forwarding the contents elsewhere. The thing is I want to do that before it is saved on my system. Im having difficulty with the documentation and cant find a working example that shows a listener implemented with access to the incoming file stream.

Negative 62301 pConsider the followingp  precode.foo .bar     echo lt gt   codepre  pAssuming we have one file code1.barcode, the command executed is simply codeecho 1.bar gt 1.foocode. However, when codecode contains a path, rather than just a file name, it start becoming finicky. My problem is that I want to prepend another path to code.barcode, the pattern becomes completely mangled. I.e., when code.barcode is codenicepath1.barcode, this becomes impossiblep  precode.foo projectsomething.bar     echo lt gt  codepre  pThis will run, but it executes codeecho nicepathprojectsomething1.bar gt 1.foocode in stead of codeecho projectsomethingnicepath1.bar gt 1.foocodep  pThe reason for this is in how make does its pattern rules. From the docs p  blockquote   pWhen the target pattern does not contain a slash and it usually does not, directory names in the file names are removed from the file name before it is compared with the target prefix and suffix. [...] The directories are ignored only for the purpose of finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application of that rule. Thus, et matches the file name srceat, with srca as the stem. When prerequisites are turned into file names, the directories from the stem are added at the front, while the rest of the stem is substituted for the . The stem srca with a prerequisite pattern cr gives the file name srccarp blockquote  pIs there any way I can turn this off for a specific rule p

Negative 62301 pIm defining the Autolayout rules of my custom UICollectionViewCell in Interface Builder. I have two sets of rulesp  ul liOne for iPhones on portrait wCompact, hRegular. In this size class, my verticalscrolling collection view shows only one column of cells.li liAnother for iPhones on landscape and iPads wRegular, hAny. In these size classes, the collection view shows two columns of cells.li ul  pI seem to have set these rules correctly because when I look at Preview in the Assistant Editor, the cell renders itself as expected, even when I rotate the device screen. However, when I run the app, the second set of layout rules the ones for landscape mode breaks when the simulator is on landscape mode. The console prints out that Autoresizing masks have been applied to some view and I need to disable it.p  pThat doesnt make sense to me at allI used Autolayout on the views in IB so the autoresizing masks should have been disabled. Ive tried the following and I still cant get this to workp  ul lipDid codeself.contentView.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsfalsecode in codeawakeFromNibcode. This only quiets the console, but the layout is still a mess. strongThis also destroys the layout for portrait mode.strongpli lipFor the two size classes I specified, IB throws no errors. It does, however, for wAny hAny. I did not specify sufficient constraints for that size class because I figured its pointlessI have rules for emallem possible combinations of the size classes. Anyway, I tried adding placeholder constraints and checked Remove at build time in IB. The IB error went away but it didnt fix the error at all.pli ul  pAny thoughtsp  pAdd I just found outthe cell itself and its codecontentViewcodes codetranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintscode property is codetruecode by default. I really dont think I should set these to codefalsecode, though. I only have Autolayout rules to their subviews.p

Negative 62301 pIm writing a templating utility for a library and trying to do it in a functional way no mutable variables and ideally no intermediate state. strongThis is mainly a learning exercise and I know there are libraries out there that do this already.strongp  pGiven the stringp  precodeHello, name What are you doing on day codepre  pI have matched the template tags against a Regex, which combined with a range finding function will return the tagged matches as range objects.p  precode[    start 7, end 14 ,    start 39, end 45  ] codepre  pI want to define the entire string as ranges, so that I can compile the ranges into a list of functions.p  precode[    start 0, end 6     start 7, end 14, tag true ,    start 15 end 38     start 39, end 45, tag true ,    start 46, end 46  ] codepre  pTagging them isnt an issue, but finding the other ranges is. This task can obviously be done with a for loop and some counter variables, but you will be mutating state. codeforcode, codeforEachcode and codewhilecode are out of the question.p  pHow would you go about getting this done without mutating state Would it be possible to get all of the ranges in one pass rather than using regex then a second pass to find the inverse rangesp  pUltimately, I will end up with a list of bound functions that look something like thisp  precode[   textHello, ,   lookupname,   text What are you doing on ,   lookupday,   text ] codepre  pCalling these will result in a series of lookups which will return string values and the text functions are just bound identity functions which will return their argument.p

It adds a few lines, converts the txt file to a PDF file and overlays it on a background image.p  pPart of the process includes using the Repl.bat file from dbenham to replace some none printable characters with CRLF.p  pIt works great when run from a command line but when run from my application an old 16 bit dos unsupported program generatordatabase the JScript generates syntax errors and other errors for as many lines as the script.p  pI do not understand JScript well enough to attempt to troubleshoot.p  pMy question Is there a what to replace not printable characters in a text file with CRLF without stripping blanks line in a batch without JScript or does anyone know why JScript works from the command prompt but not when my batch is called from application.p  pI will provide examples of code as needed but thought the geniuses on this site mat already know the solution.p  pThanks much Bobp

Negative 62301 pI am attempting to send an insert query to my db with data and an img file. This is my first attempt at sending an img file and a prepared statement. I have been stuck on this for about a month any no matter what I do it will not send. As of now nothing is inserting to my db.p  pI am just trying to send basic information to my database and send an img file to a folder I have called productpics and then move the name of the file over to my db.p  pI even just tried to add a else statement for the query part of the prepared statement and I cant get the echo part to display after submitting my form. I have validation before this for certain parts of the data nothing to do with the img upload yet. I tested this and the validation is working and not stopping the query. I think the issue resides somewhere in my prepared statement or the form.p  pIm not sure if the extra button I have for the img upload field is stopping this But I had it like this before when I had a simple insert query and everything send except for the img file to my db. Now nothing is sending.p  pDoes anyone see anything that Im doing wrong that is stopping this from workingp  precodeifvalidationgtpassed          ifissetPOST[create]              productid  trim POST[productid]              name  trim POST[name]              price  trim POST[price]              saleprice  trim POST[saleprice]              finalprice  trim POST[finalprice]              shippingprice  trim POST[shippingprice]              category  trim POST[category]              itemdetails  trim POST[itemdetails]              itemdetails2  trim POST[itemdetails2]              description  trim POST[description]              viewproducttype  trim POST[viewproducttype]              file  productpics.

Negative 62301 pIm reading through ML for the Working Programmer and am a bit confused by the authors distinction between iterative and recursive.  My understanding was that recursive just refers to a function that calls itself.  Any function that isnt recursive is iterative where an iterative algorithm usually involves some kind of looping.p  pHowever, in this book, the author will say something like luckily the obvious recursive solution is iterative.  So my understanding of these terms is definitely different from how the author is using them.  p  pCan someone clarify where Im misunderstanding these termsp  pThanks, bclaymanp

Negative 62301 pI am making an iOS app which can render big number of textures which I stream from disk on the fly. I use a NSCache for LRU cache of textures. There is one screen with a 3D model and one screen with a full screen detail of a texture where this texture can be changed with swiping. Kind of a very simple carousel. The app never takes more then 250MiB of RAM on 1GiB devices, the textures cache works good.p  pFor the fullscreen view I have a cache of VBOs based on the screen resolution and texture resolution different texture coordinates. I never delete these VBOs and always check if the VBO is OK codeglIsBuffercode. The screens are separate UIViewControllers and I use the same EAGLContext in both of them, no context sharing. This is OK as it is on the same thread.p  pAll this is Open GL ES 2.0 and everything works good. I can switch between the 3D2D screens, change the textures. The textures are createddeleted on the fly as needed based on the available memory.p  pBUT sometimes I get a random crash when rendering a full screen quad when callingp  precodeglDrawArraysGLTRIANGLESTRIP, 0, 4 codepre  pThis can happen when I receive a lot of memory warnings in a row. Sometimes I can get hundreds of memory warnings in few seconds and the app works OK but sometimes it will crash while swiping to new full screen texture quad. This happens even for textures that were already rendered in full screen. It never crashes on the 3D model which uses the same textures.p  pThe crash report is always on the codeglDrawArrayscode call in my code with a codeEXCBADACCESS KERNINVALIDADDRESS at 0x00000018code exception. The last call in a stack trace is always codegleRunVertexSubmitARMcode. This happens on various iPads and iPhones.p  pIt looks like a system memory pressure corrupts some GL memory but I do not know when, where and why.p  pI have also tried switching from VBO to the old way of having vertex data on the heap, where I first check if the vertex data is not codeNULLcode before calling codeglDrawArrayscode. The result is the same, random crashes in low memory situations.p  pAny ideas what could be wrong The address code0x00000018code in the codeEXCBADACCESScode is really bad but I do not know whose address it should be. Could a deallocated texture or shader cause a codeEXCBADACCESScode in codeglDrawArrayscodep

Negative 62301 pThis is more of a best practice question, as we already have one solution in place, yet I am curious as to whether there are better ways of solving this.p  pOur projects are divided into 1 huge base projects, that all other projects depend on and subprojects. When building a sub project, I therefore also need to check out that one. In a TFSVCbuild, this was possible on the source tab of the build definition, where you could specify exactly which projects you wanted the build agent to get for you.p  pIn git and VNEXT, this tab is gone, and instead there is only the option to specify a branch of your current repository. We solved this by adding a powershellscript to every project, that simply runs git clone mainproject, granting the same effect as before.p  pShould our main project URL ever change, this would, however, mean we had to change this script in every customer project, which while not impossible would be tedious.p  pHas anyone got experience of something similar and has found a better way of doing thisp
Negative 62301 pIm writing a tiny library to interface with Linuxs framebuffer abstraction. All of my graphics cards use the same pixel format one octet per channel, four channels, BGRA ordering, so thus far the library just assumes this format. However, the framebuffer API provides pixel format data that I must use if I want the library to work on any Linux framebuffer. You dont need to know how the framebuffer works to answer this one I hope, just some bitfiddling Im not proficient with. Heres the pixel format info provided in my headersp  precode Interpretation of offset for color fields All offsets are from the right,   inside a pixel value, which is exactly bitsperpixel wide means you   can use the offset as right argument to ltlt. A pixel afterwards is a bit   stream and is written to video memory as that unmodified.     For pseudocolor offset and length should be the same for all color   components. Offset specifies the position of the least significant bit   of the pallette index in a pixel value. Length indicates the number   of available palette entries i.e.  of entries  1 ltlt length.   struct fbbitfield          u32 offset                    beginning of bitfield                 u32 length                    length of bitfield                    u32 msbright                  0  Most significant bit is                                            right     snip   struct fbvarscreeninfo       snip           u32 bitsperpixel            guess what                            u32 grayscale                 0  color, 1  grayscale,                                              gt1  FOURCC                           struct fbbitfield red          bitfield in fb mem if true color,          struct fbbitfield green        else only length is significant          struct fbbitfield blue         struct fbbitfield transp       transparency                                 u32 nonstd                     0 Non standard pixel format        snip   codepre  pI need to write a pixel formatted with the above info to a char array from four chars R, G, B and A.

Negative 62301 pI have one issue regarding creation of REST request.p  pI have added two resources [Zygraterestv1eProcprojects] under one service end point. Both the resources have same name but different method. One is PUT method and other one is POST method.p  pAfter that I created one Test Suite and one Test  case. While adding Rest Request under test Step, soapUI editor is asking me to select from already added resources. As I have two resources with same name and different method but when I select POST method resource even though it created REST Request having PUT method.p  pIn this Case I can manually change it to POST from that test step. But Issue is when I executed test step called Data driver in which it calls that REST request then it considers the PUT method not the POST one which I changed it manually.p

Negative 62301 pIm sometimes confused about how to update variables in the global class. For example, I have the codeSoftwarecode class which displays a state string wrapped in a UI component, codeStateHandlercode to update statesstatus, and codePlugincode class which updates the state when a button is clicked. A Javalike pseudocode may roughly be p  precodeclass Software     JLabel state     ...     void CreateUI         ...         state  new JLabeldefaultState         window.addstate        class StateHandler     static String stateString     public void updateStateString...   class Plugin     ...      JButton button     void initButton         button.addListenernew EventListener             update state here                codepre  pIf I make the JLabel static in codeSoftwarecode class, it will update the state across different instances of the software. If I put the JLabel inside codeStateHandlercode, I cant find a way to initialize and add the component into the UI in codeSoftwarecode class. codeStateHandler.state  new JLabelcode returns an error.p  pOne alternative, of course, is to pass a reference of the software to a codePlugincode instance, then do some codesoftware.updateStatecode But thats not very clever.p  pWhat is the best practice to do this Thanks.p

Negative 62301 pIve got a problem with code corruption, and I need a way to check that the local stack is not messed up. Ive noticed something is overwriting the codethiscode variable well, that is what gdb seems to show. It displays the codethiscode pointer as 0x1959 or some other small 16 bit value that seems wrong,  so I stuck in a bunch of codeassertVALIDRAMMEMORYthiscode over the code with this definitionp  precodedefine VALIDRAMPOINTERx  uint64tx amp 0xFFFFFFFF00000000  0x7fff00000000ULL codepre  pAll pointers in my code that addresses that look like that, ie start with 7FFF....  However, the compiler seems to have optimized this check out. For example, if I havep  precodevoid a  suspiciouscall assertVALIDRAMPOINTERthis assertVALIDRAMPOINTERa      ltlt this one assertVALIDRAMPOINTERthis codepre  pI find that the debugger gdb catches the assert marked this one, and examining the value of codeacode and codethiscode, I find that embothem codeacode and codethiscode are bogus values like 0xabcd, instead of 0x7FFFE1484580. It seems that the compiler thinks that codethiscode is codeconstcode, and so checking it multiple times is unnecessary.  I want to cast codethiscode as codevolatilecode but thats not possible I tried. And you cant take the address of codethiscode it is not an lvalue.p  precode 1 warning 191 type qualifier is meaningless on cast type               assertVALIDMEMPOINTERvolatile decltypethisthis codepre  pWhat can I do  Using icc and gdb.p
Negative 62301 pI have a function which is quite intensive in my algorithm.p  pI want to try to make it as efficient as possible. I dont care too much for readability or anything like that. Just speed.p  pThe basis of the function is to take a set of cardsp  precodecard1, card2, card3, card4, card5, card6, card7 codepre  pWhere each card is a numeric value. p  pI then have an array of values that need to be removed from the above set.p  premovevalues  array1,4,3,8,12p  pSo basically, what I need to do is, if card1 to card7 appear in the Remove Values, set that card to 0. p  pMy current functionp  precodeforeachremovevalues as value      ifvalue  card1          card1  0          ifvalue  card2          card2  0          ifvalue  card3          card3  0          ifvalue  card4          card4  0          ifvalue  card5          card5  0          ifvalue  card6          card6  0          ifvalue  card7          card7  0       codepre  pThis works. But I was wondering if there was a more faster way of doing it Calling php functions is intensive, so Im trying to reduce the amount of those calls.p  pIm literally trying to shave off miliseconds due to my algorithm having to loop through millions of results. p
