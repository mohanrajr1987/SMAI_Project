Negative 88458 pI am using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb386987.aspx relnofollowSqlMetala to general my DataContext.dbml class for my ASP.net application using LinqToSql. When I initially created the DataContext.dbml file, Visual Studio used this to create a related DataContext.designer.cs file. This designer file contains the DataContext class in C that is used throughout the app and is derived from the XML in the dbml file and is essential to bridging the gap between the output of SqlMetal and using the DataContext with LinqToSql.p  pHowever, when I make a change to the database and recreate the dbml file, the designer file never gets regenerated in my website. Instead, the old designer file is maintained and therefore none of the changes to the DBML file are accessible through the LinqToSql DataContext class.p  pThe only process I have been able to use so far to regenerate the designer file isp  ol liGo to Windows Explorer and delete both the dbml and designer.cs filesli liGo to Visual Studio and hit Refresh in the Solution Explorer. The dbml and designer.cs files now disappear from the project.li liRegenerate the dbml file using SqlMetalli liGo to Visual Studio and hit Refresh in the Solution Explorer. Now the designer.cs file is recreated.li ol  pIt seems that Visual Studio will only generate the designer.cs file when a new dbml file is detected that does not yet have a designer.cs file. This process is pretty impractical, since it involves several manual steps and messes things up with source control.p  pDoes anyone know how I can get the designer.cs file automatically regenerated without having to follow the manual deleterefreshregeneratedelete process outlined abovep

Negative 88458 pShort version What is the best way to get data encoded in an MP3 and ideally in an AACOggWMA into a Java array or ByteBuffer that I can then manipulatep  pIm putting together a program that has slowing down and speeding up sound files as one of its features.  This works fine for WAV files, which are a header plus the exact binary data that needs to be sent to the speaker, and now I need to implement it for MP3 ideally, this would also support AAC, Ogg, and WMA, but since those are less popular formats this is not required.  Android does not expose an interface to decode the MP3 without playing it, so I need to create that interface.p  pThree options present themselves, though Im open to othersp  p1  Write my own decoder.  I already have a functional frame detector that I was hoping to use for option 3, and now should only need to implement the Huffman decoding tables.p  p2  Use JLayer, or an equivalent Java library, to handle the decoding.  Im not entirely clear on what the license ramifications are here.p  p3  Connect to the libmedia libraryMediaPlayerService.  This is what SoundPool does, and the amount of use of that service make me believe that while its officially unstable, that implementation isnt going anywhere.  This means writing JNI code to connect to the service, but Im finding that thats a deep rabbit hole.  At the surface, Im having trouble with the splt template.p

The action contract would specify the codedocode member function in its interface which would have in turn to be overloaded in the child classesp  pPersonnaly I find the second approach to be more intersting as it allow you to nicely encapsulate the data and the action in the derived actionContract and in turn makes it easier to add new actions.

Negative 88458 pI am working on a software project and have written a validation system to help prevent theft of the software. I was reading back through the code, and found a huge loophole that could potentially allow the motiviated users to copy the program and install it without even contacting the activation server. So, I modified the program and the server to patch that up. Now, I need a PHP page that can check to make sure the user paid for the software, payments made using PayPal, then generate a random string. I then need the page to POST that random string to the validation server  HTTP  and listen for the response from the server. It will need to POST this parameter Validator  [Random String] It will tell the page if the random string has already been submitted and to try another, or that it accepted the string. I would like the string to be numerical, but I think alpha  numeric would be better and give more options. I am pretty confident this can be done, but am not sure how to do the PHP part.p
Negative 88458 pIm writing a simple little game for my kids  it doesnt really matter what it does, though I couldnt tell you anyway, since Ithey havent quite decided yet However, I think it will have a server component and a number of client components, and Im looking at ways that the clients can communicate with the server. p  pALL my previous experience... my entire career in fact... has involved the server element either being a database, a web server, or the two in tandem. Neither are appropriate in this case, so Im curious as to what means I could amp should use to communicate between the two.p  pObviously, it would be preferable to adopt a technology or technique that I can reuse in my work, where Im increasingly working with Windows Forms. I imagine there are 1001 different approaches I could adopt its a question of sorting the wheat from the chaff.p  pIve literally just started reading about WCF, but its unclear as yet, if this serviceoriented approach is what Im looking for. p  pIm being deliberately vague about what the applications will do I expect the client will announce their presence to the server, will feed user choices up to the server, and in return, the server will periodically update the client with what is going on in the wider game. The game will be turnbased rather than realtime... and quite lowtech reallyp  pSuggestions Ideally, with links to good learning resources if any are known.p  pConclusion I actually thought there might be more viable alternatives there is Remoting now depracated, but the consensus says that WCF is the way to go  in my case, selfhosting looks appealing.p  pThanks for the responses.p

Negative 88458 pI want to get the communitys perspective on this. If I have a process which is heavily DBIO bound, how smart would it be to parallelize individual process paths using the Task Parallel libraryp  pIll use an example ... if I have a bunch of items, and I need to do the following operationsp  ol liQuery a DB for a list of itemsli liDo some aggregation operations to group certain items based on a dynamic list of parameters.li liFor each grouped result, Query the database for something based on the aggregated result.li liFor each grouped result, Do some numeric calculations 3 and 4 would happen sequentially.li liDo some inserts and updates for the result calculated in 3li liDo some inserts and updates for each item returned in 1li ol  pLogically speaking, I can parallelize into a graph of tasks at steps 3, 5, 6 as one item has no bearing on the result of the previous. However, each of these will be waiting on the database sql server which is fine and I understand that we can only process as far as the SQL server will let us. p  pBut I want to logically distribute the task on the local machine so that it processes as fast as the Database lets us without having to wait for anything on our end. Ive done some mock prototype where I substitute the db calls with Thread.Sleeps I also tried some variations with .SpinWait, which was a million times faster, and the parallel version is waaaaay faster than the current implementation which is completely serial and not parallel at all.p  pWhat Im afraid of is putting too much strain on the SQL server ... are there any considerations I should consider before I go too far down this path p

Negative 88458 pforgive me if this is a bit of a newbie question, I started to learn Django yesterday, and Im trying not to get into bad habits, i.e. I am trying to do things the django way from the start.p  pI have a view that recieves binary data as a http post field. Now Django of course autoconverts my binary data to a unicode string.p  pMy question is, how do I just get the raw binary datap  pA couple of things occurred to me. Let coderequestcode be the request Im processing.p  ul liUsing coderequest.rawpostdatacode would involve parsing the data emagainem  when appearantly coderequest.POSTcode actually stores raw data and I am actually just trying to get around the onthefly conversion and besides, that is new in the development version.li liUsing base64 or so to transfer the data would work, but seems like too much overhead when the data transfer itself is not the problem.li lidoing coderequest.encodingfoocode before getting that field and reassigning afterwards doesnt work either because I still get a unicode string, besides feeling like a bit of a dirty hack. Using codebase64code here not as bad as for the transfer encoding gives me an codeAssertionErrorcode.li ul  pThanks in advance for your ideasp  pEDIT To clarify  I am not talking about a classic file upload here, but as binary data stored in a POST field. Id like to do it that way because the only way I want to interface with that view is via an upload script. Using a normal POST field makes both the client and the server much simpler in that case.p

Negative 88458 pI have a WebView, and I have the following codep  precodewebview.setInitialScale75 codepre  pI also have zooming disabledp  precodewebview.getSettings.setSupportZoomfalse codepre  pBoth of these pieces of code work very well until any sort of textbox input field is selected within the WebView, then the application scales to 100.p  pIm trying to figure out how to intercept and stop the scale from taking place when a textbox is selected, however Ive had no luck with the following p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidviewView.htmlonCheckIsTextEditor2829 relnofollowcodeonCheckIsTextEditorcodea  This doesnt seem to fire when the textbox is clickedp  pI can change the Scale back to 75 after the page scales by Overriding the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitWebViewClient.html relnofollowcodeonScaleChangedcodea method within the WebViewClient class.  However this can only be done by looping through with the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitWebView.htmlzoomOut2829 relnofollowcodezoomOutcodea method until the proper scale is met.p  pTo me it seems there must be a location where the click actually fires the event to focus the textbox and redraw the view to scale it and codeonScaleChangedcode is called, I just havent been able to locate it yet.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 88458 pRecently, I decided to add 4 languages to my application. I read about how to do it and I succeed.p  pBut there are two problemsquestions I would like to ask.p  pFirst question Is there a better way to change the text of each control insteadp  precodeprivate System.Resources.ResourceManager rm  System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new System.Globalization.CultureInfofr rm  new System.Resources.ResourceManagertypeofMainForm codepre  pand then for each control to write this linep  precodeaboutToolStripMenuItem.Text  rm.GetStringaboutToolStripMenuItem.Text addTaskToolStripMenuItem.Text  rm.GetStringaddTaskToolStripMenuItem.Text addTaskToolStripMenuItem1.Text  rm.GetStringaddTaskToolStripMenuItem1.Text ... codepre  pSecond Question lets say the text of label1 is test and in other language its testest then the size of the label will change, which is ok. but If I got label2 that his location is near label1, label1 might be on the top of label2. How can I move the label1 compare with label2 so no matter how long the text in label1 will be, label2s location will be relative to label1. I dont want to use calculations in the program, I want to know if theres other way like property in one of the controls.p  pEDIT after long thinking, I decided to use XML for my multilanguage. this way I can let the people translate it and upload it for me plus I can use it on runtime instead or reload the programs.p  pAbout the relative pos of controls I will use codeFlowLayoutPanelcode or codeTableLayoutPanelcode I will check further which is better.p

Negative 88458 pI want to look at the syntax tree that is generated by g during compilation. Actually I want to understand the way how highlevel C statements especially initialization statements of classes and structure objects are parsed by the g compiler and how the compiler do the semantic analysis of these constructs. My objective is specific for g only, and any general information regarding parsing and semantic analysis will not be helpful for me.p  pLooking at the g code, I could find out the data structure used inside and the different type of nodes it creates in files tree.def etc. I am wondering if there are good documentations available somewhere explaining this issue.

Negative 88458 pProblem I have a simple QStringListModel that I want to display in a view.  However, I want each item in the view to be a custom QWidget that I have created.  I do not understand why this is such a difficult problem  I have scoured the internet for solutions and, although I find bits and pieces here and there, no good solution fits all my needs.p  pThe basic code for setting up my modelviewp  pre code QStringList strings  add some strings to the model  QStringListModel model  new QStringListModelstrings QListView view  new QListView  viewsetModelmodel  code pre  pI have tried various attempts at doing this to no avail.p  pbAttempt 1bp  pI tried subclassing a new QItemDelegate object.  Inside this object, I overrode the methods for creating an editor.  I followed all the steps for setting up that delegate.  The problem is that when the view is populated with the model, it grabs each item in the model in QtDisplayRole when I need it to grab each item in QtEditRole.p  pbAttempt 2bp  pAnother method I tried was to subclass a QListView, and override the setModel method to call setIndexWidget for each item in the model.  My code looks something thisp  pre code void CustomListViewsetModelQAbstractItemModel model      QListViewsetModelmodel      for int i  0 i rowCount i              QModelIndex index  modelindexi, 0          CustomWidget widget  new CustomWidget         setIndexWidgetindex, widget       code pre  pThis worked as far as adding my CustomWidget object to each row in the list view.  In order to ensure that the regular model data was not also shown beneath my CustomWidget objects, I also overrode CustomListViewpaintEventQPaintEvent event to do nothing.  Again, this worked.  p  pBut my major issue now is that when the list is displayed, although my CustomWidgets are displayed on it properly, the background of the list is a solid white color.  I tried calling setAutoFillBackgroundfalse on the CustomListView but that did nothing. I want my list view to have a transparent background.p  pAny feedback on this problem would be igreatlyi appreciated.  I have spent a lot of time trying to get this to work  Thanksp
Negative 88458 pAs far as I know, in C one can declare the same name multiple times, as far as it has the same type in all these declarations.

It generates one DB call with join to fetch the CurrencyText. But the model is strongsimplifiedstrong, real one has many more fields. I want to make the code strongreusablestrong because I have many different queries, that returns the same ViewModel. Now every minor change to OrderViewModel requires lots of maintainance.p  pSo I moved the code to OrderViewModel itself as a constructor.p  precodepublic OrderViewModelTableOrder ord      OrderId  ord.OrderId,     OrderSum  ord.OrderSum,     OrderCurrencyId  ord.OrderCurrencyId,     OrderCurrencyView  ord.Currency.CurrencyText  codepre  pAnd call it like this.p  precodevar query  from ord in ctx.TableOrders         select new OrderViewModelord codepre  pstrongThe Problemstrong The join is gone DB query is no more optimised. Now I get 1N calls to database to fetch CurrencyText for every line.p  pAny comments are welcome. Maybe I have missed different great approach.p  pThis is how emfarem i could get on my own, to get the code strongreusabilitystrong. I created a function that does the job and has multiple parameters. Then I need to explicitly pass it everything that has strongcrossedstrong the line of entity. p  precodevar query  ctx.TableOrders.Selectm gt        newOrderViewModelm, m.Currency.CurrencyText codepre  pThe DB call is again optimized. But it still does not feel like I am there yet What tricks do You know for this casep  hr  pstrongEDIT  The final solutionstrong  Thanks to a hint by Muhammad Adeel Zahid I arrived at this solution. I created an extension for IQueryable p  precodepublic static class Mappers      public static IEnumerableltOrderViewModelgt OrderViewModelsthis IQueryableltTableOrdergt q              return from ord in q                 select new OrderViewModel                                      OrderId  ord.OrderId,                     OrderSum  ord.OrderSum,                     OrderCurrencyId  ord.OrderCurrencyId,                     OrderCurrencyView  ord.Currency.CurrencyText                        codepre  pNow i can do this to get all listp  precodevar orders  ctx.TableOrder.OrderViewModels.ToList codepre  por this to get a single item, or anything in between with Wherex  ..p  precodevar order  ctx.TableOrder    .Wherex gt x.OrderId  id.OrderViewModels.SingleOrDefault codepre  pAnd that completely solves this question. The SQL generated is perfect and the code to translate objects is reusable. Approach like this should work with both LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Entities. Not tested with the latter Thank You again Muhammad Adeel Zahidp
Negative 88458 pI found this on StackOverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions103725isthereawaytoprogramaticallydetermineifafontfilehasaspecificunicodeIs there a way to programatically determine if a font file has a specific Unicode Glyphap  pHowever, I need to also check UTF32 characters. What I am trying to do is parse the Unihan data over at unicode.org and ignore all characters that are not supported by Arial Unicode MS. I started work on the CheckIfCharInFont method by modifying the arg to take a string for utf32 and checking if it is a surrogare pair. I then get the Int32 by doing a char.ConvertToUtf32surrogate1, surrogate2, but the problem is the current CheckIfCharInFont method only supports Uint16... you can see where I placed a Debugger.Break that this is a bit of a problem.

Every time authentication fails I want to log it in my database. To do that I need the username, timestamp, etc. Every time authentication fails the system will check failures count and if its more than 3 it will lock the users account. So, I could do it in my loginerror.jsp, but I need the username. Cant find it anywhere . So far I experimented with a filter, but it appears that you cant filter on jsecuritycheck urlpatter at least not in glassfish 3.1. So really, the main issue here is getting the username of the person that failed the login passed to loginerror.jsp in any form attribute, parameter, whatever. Will go and experiment with some java script and form submission.. hehe. Thanks.p

Negative 88458 pI would like to have an iterator that can be read by multiple threads concurrently so that I can process the data of the iterators source in parallel. The challenge is that I cant really couple codehasNextcode with its logical codenextcode as those could go to different threads. That is, two threads can call codehasNextcode, each see true, and then have the second thread fail because there was only one item. My problem is that for some sources I dont really know if it has a next element until I try to read it. One such example is reading lines from a file another is reading codeTermcode instances from a Lucene index. p  pI was thinking of setting up a queue inside the iterator and feeding the queue with a separate thread. That way, codehasNextcode is implemented in terms of the queue size. But I dont see how I could guarantee that the queue is filled because that thread could get starved.p  pShould I ignore the Iterator contract, and just call codenextcode exhaustively until a codeNoSuchElementExceptioncode is thrownp  pIs there a more elegant way of handling the problem p

Negative 88458 pI have a custom tab widget, with a lot of views whose backing CALayer objects are taking up too much memory. Im looking at releasing views for background tabs, but it would be simpler if I could just ask the framework to release the backing CALayer which is where most of the memory is going and have it recreate it on demand. Is that possiblep  pDoes a nested view hierarchy consume more memory than a flatter one, because there are more CALayer objects, with mostly the same pixels If a 100 x 100 view takes X memory, does it mean that a 100 x 100 view with a 100x100 subview takes roughly 2Xp  pWhy didnt Apple go with the AppKit model where the programmer controls which views have backing Core Animation layers That would consume a lot less memory, which is scarce on iOS compared to OS X.

How do I tell spring MVC to FILTER the http post parameters and not set them on the form backing object when the user role is something other than a Director Can I do this I know I can use InitBinder as a catch all case, but I dont think I can use this on a perrequest basis... can Ip  pI know Rails just recently added this feature in their latest versions of their framework, so I would not be surprised if Spring did not have it.

The EntityType codeRepositories.Questioncode does not declare a navigation property with the name codeAnswerscode.p  pFirst of all, this exception is odd as it references the type codeRepositories.Questioncode, which does not exist It should be codeModel.Questioncode.p  pThe Model assembly already has InternalsVisibleTo set to Repositoriesp  precode[assembly InternalsVisibleToRepositories] codepre  pWhich means that we do not get compile errors in the mapping code and we have tried the followingp  precode[assembly InternalsVisibleToEntityFramework] [assembly InternalsVisibleToSystem.Data.Entity] codepre  pBut we still get the aforementioned exception.p  pAny ideas why we are getting thisp  hr  h2Edith2  pLadislav Mrnka, thanks for the help This is still causing us pain.p  pWe have already defined the relationship using the fluent APIp  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltAnswergt     .HasRequireda gt a.Question     .WithManyq gt q.Answers     .Mapx gt x.MapKeyQuestionId codepre  pAnd this does work when the property q.Answers is set to public.

The C .net 3.5 piece Im writing now should be able to verify a separate process is running, as I understand it the best way using the Mutex class.p  pSo I have a method in my SrsUpdaterController class like so...p  precodepublic bool IsUpdaterRunning      Mutex srsUpdaterMutex  new Mutexfalse, SRSUPDATERGUID     if srsUpdaterMutex.WaitOne0 If SRS Updater is running              srsUpdaterMutex.ReleaseMutex         srsUpdaterMutex.Close         return false          else                                          return true       codepre  pand I have a test p  precode[TestMethod] public void IsUpdaterRunningTrueTest      SrsUpdaterController target  new SrsUpdaterController     string mutexGuid  SrsUpdaterController.SRSUPDATERGUID                 bool expected  true     bool actual      Mutex srsUpdaterMutex  new Mutexfalse, mutexGuid                 srsUpdaterMutex.WaitOne3000     actual  target.IsUpdaterRunning                srsUpdaterMutex.ReleaseMutex     srsUpdaterMutex.Close     Assert.AreEqualexpected, actual              codepre  pIt doesnt work because the unit test and the IsUpdaterRunning method are called by the same thread, and so a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms68241128vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowWindows is smart enougha to not make the process block its self. The problem is I WANT the process to block its self so that it simulates the mutex being claimed. Is there any way to do this Or am I approaching unit testingprocess synchronizationmutex management all wrongp  pnote, I did also try locking the Mutex on a separate thread launched from the test, but it still allowed me to claim the mutex in both places. Which is ok because Id rather avoid threads when possiblep  pThanks in advancep
Negative 88458 pIm creating a couple of interfaces intended to provide access to a callback functionality. That is, inheriting from eminterface Aem allows a class to use callbacks of type one eminterface Bem allows type two. Inheriting from both A and B allows callbacks of both types. The ultimate purpose is that classes A and B will take care of all the dirty work by just inheriting from them.p  h3First Problemh3  pHeres a small example that should illustrate some of the trouble Im havingp  precodeclass A  public     static void AFoo void inst               AinstgtABar           virtual void ABar void   0   class B  public     static void BFoo void inst               BinstgtBBar           virtual void BBar void   0   class C  public A, public B  public     void ABar void  cout ltlt A      void BBar void  cout ltlt B   codepre  pAnd by making the callsp  precodeC cinst  new C  void AFoo void  CAFoo void BFoo void  CBFoo AFoo voidcinst  BFoo voidcinst  codepre  pI expect Ill get AB as output. Instead I get AA. Reversing the order of derived classes B before A, produces BB. Why is thisp  h3Second Problemh3  pThe actual interfaces Im using are templated, so the code appears more likep  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class A  public     static void AFoo void inst               TinstgtABar           virtual void ABar void   0   template ltclass Tgt class B  public     static void BFoo void inst               TinstgtBBar           virtual void BBar void   0   class C  public AltCgt, public BltCgt  public     void ABar void  cout ltlt A      void BBar void  cout ltlt B   codepre  pThe reason for this is so A and B can do all the work, but their implementations dont need to have any knowledge of C.p  pNow, calling withp  precodeC cinst  new C  void AFoo void  CAFoo void BFoo void  CBFoo AFoo voidcinst  BFoo voidcinst  codepre  pproduces the correct output AB.p  pThis small example works fine here, but it doesnt always work correctly in practice. Very strange things start happening, similar to the weirdness in the first problem above. The main issue appears to be that both virtual functions or the static functions, or something dont always make it into C.p  pFor instance, I can successfully call CAFoo, but not always CBFoo. And this is sometimes dependent on the order in which I derive from A and B codeclass C public AltCgt, public BltCgtcode may produce code where neither AFoo or BFoo work, while codeclass C public BltCgt, public AltCgtcode may produce code where one of them works, or maybe both.p  pSince the classes are templated, I can remove the virtual functions in A and B. Doing so produces working code, so long as ABar and BBar exist in C of course. Thats acceptable, but not desired Id rather know what the problem is.p  pWhat possible reasons are there that the above code could cause bizarre problemsp  pWhy does the second example produce the correct output where though the first doesntp

Negative 88458 pIm using Google Appengine with Python 2.5 and I have a function that is causing a bottleneck. I pass it a list of 200 Model instances retrieved from the datastore, and it returns it in a json format which I then pass to the client. p  pI originally used  to concatenate all the values together, but it was taking around 30 seconds for the server to respond with the JSON. I ran some checks and the code before this function runs in under a second.

This function takes on average 30 seconds to execute. p  pI read this a hrefhttpskymind.comocrowpythonstring relnofollowarticlea and tried using the codecStringIOcode method I also used the list join method but it took the same amount of time and codecStringIOcode uses less memory so I stuck with it.

Negative 88458 pIm using LibSVM in Java fwiw to classify text samples into one of two categories english or spanish language.

Negative 88458 pWhen I was programming in Java, I used to have objects and managers for them. You know, a class typically singleton, which would hold a collection of objects of a certain class and let to conviniently manage them. Now, in Scala, I am finding myself more and more in the situation, where it is quite tempting to put all that functionality in a companion object and avoid creating the distinct manager object.p  pIt all starts with giving IDs to instances and then... why not having the collection in the companion object And if the collection is there, why not having all the methods to work with the collection in there And so, the manager is not needed anymore. However, one pecularity is that the companion object usually has a single name like codeCarcode not like codeCarscode or codeCarManagercode which presume plurality, so methods that operate with plurals look weird in their coupled wording with the object name.p  pI would like to know your opinion on this situation and to know if this approach is preferable over the soseemed unnecessary bloated manager pattern. Any references to any articles on that would also be appreciated.p

Negative 88458 pI debugged and searched for quite a while and I cant figure out what is happening. This is my first time doing a codecustom session handlercode, so Im afraid Im overlooking something painfully obvious. I want to implement a custom session handler so I can store additional information with the sessions and be able to temporarily disable access to protected areas of the site for certain groups of users.p  pMy login page which was working fine with basic filebased php sessions, includes a php file with a lot of functions including the session handler functions and my error handler. That included file includes a third file that does the database connection. The connection is made using codemysqliconnectcode and the resulting link is stored in a variable, codedbccode. That same connection is used throughout the site for logging errors, loadingediting site content, etc. I decided to use the same database connection, since it is used already on every page and my session handler will need to be used on almost every page as well. Nowhere in my code do I manually close the database connection, but I think perhaps it is automatically closing somehow.p  pMy functions access the database connection dbc with a global statement. Exp  precodefunction sesswriteid, data      global dbc     ... codepre  pMy codeopencode, codereadcode, and codewritecode functions are supposed to use the variable in this manner. I checked the database connection variable in the open and read functions and it is nonnull as expected, but in my write function it suddenly shows up as null. Is PHP doing something between read and write that could potentially be closing that connection I created a test variable in the same included file that creates the database connection, and used the same codeglobal testcode statement in the write function, and that variable appears just fine, so Im guessing it has something to do with the database being closed. I tried using a second variable to store the database connection to only be used by the session handler and that didnt work either. Any ideas Am I just being dumb as usualp

Negative 88458 pI need a string grid which can scroll smoothly, as opposed to locking in the top row  left col positions. When you scroll a codeTStringGridcode, the left visible column and top visible row snap into position along the topleft edges. I need the ability for the user to scroll smoothly, not locking these edges into place.p  pI wouldnt think this is possible to modify in the VCL codeTStringGridcode or codeTCustomGridcode for that matter because it relies on properties such as codeTopRowcode, codeLeftColcode, codeVisibleRowCountcode, etc.. Im pretty sure Ill need a third party control, but Id love to use the codeTStringGridcode if possible, because I already have a lot of code wrapped around it. If I do need a thirdparty grid, then Im hoping it works closely enough like the codeTStringGridcode.p

Negative 88458 pI am doing some benchmarks with an optimized Java NIO selector on Linux over loopback 127.0.0.1.p  pMy test is very simplep  ul liOne program sends an UDP packet to another program that echoes it back to the sender and the round trip time is computed. The next packet is only sent when the previous one is acked when it returns. A proper warm up with a couple of millions messages is conducted before the benchmark is performed. The message has 13bytes not counting UDP headers.li ul  pFor the round trip time I get the following resultsp  ul liMin time 13 microsli liAvg time 19 microsli li75 percentile 18,567 nanosli li90 percentile 18,789 nanosli li99 percentile 19,184 nanosli li99.9 percentile 19,264 nanosli li99.99 percentile 19,310 nanosli li99.999 percentile 19,322 nanosli ul  pBut the catch here is that I am spinning 1 million messages.p  pIf I spin only 10 messages I get very different resultsp  ul liMin time 41 microsli liAvg time 160 microsli li75 percentile 150,701 nanosli li90 percentile 155,274 nanosli li99 percentile 159,995 nanosli li99.9 percentile 159,995 nanosli li99.99 percentile 159,995 nanosli li99.999 percentile 159,995 nanosli ul  pCorrect me if I am wrong, but I suspect that once we get the NIO selector spinning the response times become optimum. However if we are sending messages with a large enough interval between them, we pay the price of waking up the selector.p  pIf I play around with sending just a single message I get various times between 150 and 250 micros.p  pSo my questions for the community arep  p1  Is my minimum time of 13 micros with average of 19 micros optimum for this round trip packet test. It looks like I am beating a hrefhttpwww.zeromq.org relnofollowZeroMQa by far so I may be missing something here. From this benchmark it looks like ZeroMQ has a 49 micros avg time 99 percentile on a standard kernel  a hrefhttpwww.zeromq.orgresultsrttestsv031 relnofollowhttpwww.zeromq.orgresultsrttestsv031ap  p2  Is there anything I can do to improve the selector reaction time when I spin a single or very few messages 150 micros does not look good. Or should I assume that on a prod environment the selector will not be quitep  hr  pBy doing busy spinning around selectNow I am able to get better results. Sending few packets is still worse than sending many packets, but I think I am now hitting the selector performance limit. My resultsp  ul liSending a single packet I get a consistent 65 micros round trip time.li liSending two packets I get around 39 micros round trip time on average.li liSending 10 packets I get around 17 micros round trip time on average.li liSending 10,000 packets I get around 10,098 nanos round trip time on average.li liSending 1 million packets I get 9,977 nanos round trip time on average.li ul  pstrongConclusionsstrongp  ul lipSo it looks like the physical barrier for the UDP packet round trip is an average of 10 microseconds although I got some packets making the trip in 8 micros min time. pli lipWith busy spinning thanks Peter I was able to go from 200 micros on average to a consistent 65 micros on average for a single packet.pli lipNot sure why ZeroMQ is a hrefhttpwww.zeromq.orgresults3arttestsv031 relnofollow5 times slowera than that. strongEditstrong Maybe because I am testing this on the same machine through loopback and ZeroMQ is using two different machinespli ul

Negative 88458 pI have a few a few model classes such as a user class which is passed a dictionary, and wraps it providing various methods, some of which communicate with the database when a value needs to be changed. The dictionary itself is made from an sqlalchemy RowProxy, so all its keys are actually attribute names taken directly from the sql user table. attributes include userid, username, email, passwd, etcp  pIf a user is logged in, should I simply save this dictionary to a redis key value store, and simply call a new user object when needed and pass it this dictionary from rediswhich should be faster than only saving a user id in a session and loading the values again from the db based on that userid p  pOr should I somehow serialize the entire object and save it in redis Id appreciate any alternate methods of managing model and session objects that any of you feel would be better as well.p  pIn case anyone is wondering Im only using the sqlalchemy expression language, and not the orm. Im using the model classes as interfaces, and coding against those.p

Negative 88458 pIm using a WordPress plugin that switches from flash to jQuery when flash isnt available. Id like to use the the jQuery version only, even on browsers with flash installed. I tried to get into the swfobject.js and see if I could trick it to search for a version of flash that didnt exist, thus switch to the jQuery version, but its coded in a minimal fashion and I cant see any version numbers. Obviously, Im a bit of a novice when it comes to javascript. p  pThe plugin is GRAND FlAGallery GRAND Flash Album Gallery and I want to use the PhotoSwipe option which I can customize with CSS. I know there are plugin versions of PhotoSwipe, but the ones Ive found dont show the option to display EXIF info as does the version included in GRAND FlAGallery. I found no documentation on how to show that info on the Photo Swipe siteGitHub either.p  pMy hope is that someone can show me a swfobject hack that will switch to the alternate content. But if anyone knows how to add the info button to the PhotoSwipe plugin, that would be just as useful or more. Installing the PhotoSwipe plugin now actually removes the info button even on pages created by GRAND FlAGallery.p

Negative 88458 pIm new to Java applet programming, so excuse me if this is a very basic question, but Ive googled it extensively and have only found semirelated problems and solutions.p  pIm writing a simple demonstration of some geometric algorithms, and when I coderepaintcode, only some of my graphics primitives are rendered to the screen.  Every time my applet redraws, a seemingly random subset of my lines and ellipses are painted.

I.E, sometimes it will draw primitives 02, sometimes 05, sometimes the whole batch.p  pI would like to point out that, as far as I can tell, this is not the classic flickering that can be solved with doublebufferring.  To my understanding, flickering is when for short periods of time you can see a partially rendered applet before it finishes rendering.  In my case, however, if it doesnt finish rendering, it emneverem finishes unless I coderedrawcode again and get lucky.

Negative 88458 pIm having a little trouble figuring out how to create an inherited class that extends a windows form control to always have an event handler that will handle a keypress event for each instance of that object.p  pIm probably explaining this poorly. Essentially I want to extend the DatagridView class in windows forms to always have a keyPress event handler present for any instantiated object of my extended DatagridView class.p  pI was wondering if its possible to have an event handler that listens for key presses and handles them with code similar to what I have written belowp  precode    private void dgvObjectKeyPressobject sender, KeyPressEventArgs e              if Char.IsLetterOrDigite.KeyChar                      start the loop at the currently selected row in the datagridview             for int i  dgvObject.SelectedRows[0].Index i lt dgvObject.Rows.Count i                              will only evaluate to true when the current index has iterated above above the                  selected rows index number AND the key press event argument matches the first character of the current row                  character of the                  if i gt dgvObject.SelectedRows[0].Index ampamp dgvObject.Rows[i].Cells[1].FormattedValue                     .ToString.StartsWithe.KeyChar.ToString, true, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture                                      selects current iteration as the selected row                     dgvObject.Rows[i].Selected  true                     scrolls datagridview to selected row                     dgvObject.FirstDisplayedScrollingRowIndex  dgvObject.SelectedRows[0].Index                     break out of loop as I want to select the first result that matches                     break                                             codepre  pThe code above simply selects the next row that begins with the character of whatever the keypress event has in its event argument when fired. The reason I was wondering if I could have this as an inherited handler that is always present. I figured itd be better than explicitly creating hundreds of handlers in my windows form for each individual DatagridView object. If my thinking is wrong please feel free to correct me Anyway thanks for any input.p  pIve been programming in C for about 5 months now, still learning as I go p

Negative 88458 pI have a database app written in Microsoft Access 2010.  Among other things it has two related tables Orders, which has entries for generic information about an order, and FrameOrder which has information about a specific type of order.

When I look at it in the debugger, it seems as though the frs.AddNew call generated a record whose key is that of an existing record, somewhere in the middle of the table  If I do a Compact And Repair Database on the backend, the problem goes away.p  pSince this app is still under development, Ill often copy the front and back end files to a development system, do some work, then copy them back to the production system.  This problem shows up most frequently after Ive done such a copy yes, I make sure that the database is closed before I copy.p  pAny ideas what could be going onp  pThanksp

Negative 88458 pI was wondering if somebody could give me some advice. At the moment we are building a application that uses a lot of APIs, such as Flickr, Facebook, Salesforge, Picasa, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Now I was wondering what would eb the best idea to tackle the problem of data usage. First of all, requesting all that data eats away at your data capacities.  Also the application should eb able to handle 1000s of users at the same time so using all those requests might get us flagged as DDOS attackers P So my solution would be to store everything locally in MySQL, and update critical data every hour and other data once a day. How would you guys tackle this problem One other problem is images, we will be using 1000000s of pictures. Would you guys recommend hosting those locally and updating them every so often, or just store links and send those to users One final problem I am having, is how does MySQL perform with 1000s of users making hundreds of request every second, from complex tables.

When I deploy to the staging server, another node is showed for that view because that server has another node with that given nid.p  pMy question is How should I approach this Can I use an alias insted of nid in the view Or is there a way to export the node AND keep a fixed nid between the two servers Or is there a better wayp  pThanks p

Negative 88458 pIn python, should withstatements be used inside a generator To be clear, I am not asking about using a decorator to create a context manager from a generator function. I am asking whether there is an inherent issue using a withstatement as a context manager inside a generator as it will catch codeStopIterationcode and codeGeneratorExitcode exceptions in at least some cases. Two examples follow.p  pA good example of the issue is raised by Beazleys example page 106. I have modified it to use a with statement so that the files are explicitly closed after the yield in the opener method. I have also added two ways that an exception can be thrown while iterating the results.p  precodeimport os import fnmatch  def findfilestopdir, pattern     for path, dirname, filelist in os.walktopdir         for name in filelist             if fnmatch.fnmatchname, pattern                 yield os.path.joinpath,name def openerfilenames     f  None     for name in filenames         print F before open s  f         f  openname,r         with openname,r as f             print Fname s, F d  name, f.fileno             yield f             print F after yield s  f def catfilelist     for i,f in enumeratefilelist         if i 20              Cause and exception             f.writefoobar         for line in f             yield line def greppattern,lines     for line in lines         if pattern in line             yield line  pylogs  findfilesvarlog,.log files  openerpylogs lines  catfiles pylines  greppython, lines i  0 for line in pylines     i 1     if i  10         raise RuntimeErrorYoure hosed  print Counted d linesn  i codepre  pIn this example, the context manager successfully closes the files in the opener function. When an exception is raised, I see the trace back from the exception, but the generator stops silently. If the withstatement catches the exception why doesnt the generator continuep  pWhen I define my own context managers for use inside a generator. I get runtime errors saying that I have ignored a codeGeneratorExitcode. For examplep  precodeclass CManagerobject       def enterself           print   enter           return self     def exitself, exctype, value, tb         print   exit excptype s value s  exctype, value         return True  def foon     for i in xrangen         with CManager as cman             cman.val  i             yield cman  Case1  for item in foo10     print Pass  val d  item.val  Case2 for item in foo10     print Fail  val d  item.val     item.notanattribute codepre  pThis little demo works fine in case1 with no exceptions raised, but fails in case2 where an attribute error is raised. Here I see a codeRuntimeExceptioncode raised because the with statement has caught and ignored a codeGeneratorExitcode exception.p  pCan someone help clarify the rules for this tricky use case I suspect it is something I am doing, or not doing in my codeexitcode method. I tried adding code to reraise codeGeneratorExitcode, but that did not help.p

Negative 88458 pIm looking for a solution to an issue with storing data. let me explain.p  pIve written a browser plugin which positions elements on specific pages. when the element is clicked it opens an iFrame which connects to a facebook app, pulls some details and stores some data on a mysql database.p  pthat all works great because the iframe is from my url so it is allowed to connect to facebook.p  pNow my issuep  pI need to be able to store a time value using javascript before the element is clicked.p  ul lipi would use local storage but thats specific to the url youre on. I need to be able to access the stored time value upon any url since the plugin is called and loads a .js file onto every website.pli lipthen i tried connecting to facebook, pulling the users ID, connecting to mysql and storing it their relative to the user ID. That doesnt work since facebook wont let me connect to its server when im outside the specified url for the app and thus i cant get user ID.pli lipi would store it on the iframe when its clicked, but i need access to it before its clicked.pli lipthen i thought what if i loaded an invisible iFrame onto the webpage, and either stored it in local storage specific to my Url, or use the iframe to pull the facebook ID  and check on  the mysql database. no, since i cant access the iframe outside of the iframe and thus use information on the plugin data. hmmpli lipthen i thought about storing the data within the app itself, like in chromes content.js. thats cool, but this extension will be converted to firefox, safari and windows using www.crossrider.com. amazing site btw. thus im not sure if its possible.pli ul  pAny solutions Either to store values across domains, or access facebook api across domains or somethingp  paaaggghh. thanks p

Negative 88458 pI have an indexed table view in which the cells are grouped alphabetically into sections. I would like to be able to only load a block of the data associated with a particular section when that indexed section is selected.

You can select the letter P for example to jump to cells that have content that starts with the letter P.p  pIs there any way to detect the selection of an indexed section so that I can then reload the cells in that section once I load the block of data associated with that sectionp

Negative 88458 pI have an SSIS Package which I execute manually for testing. When I do so, an error occurs see pic below. But first let me explain what happens in the package There is just the dataflow itself. In there I query a view OLE DB Source which will provide me the parameters I will need for the next step. Then the arrow points to the OLE DB Command where I EXEC a stored procedure on the local DB server and hand over the parameters as well.  This SP is my wrapper where 3 main things happen 1. SET XACTABORT ON we will need this for distributed transaction later on 2. Call a helper SP which will create a new Synonym to my Remote Target table. this creates a synonym like MYREMOTETABLE, when it is created I can query it maunally with no problem 3. Call the helper SP which will perform the main task. This helper SP has a BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION. In there I insert into MYREMOTETABLE some records from my local DB. Now I placed a log entry directly before and directly after the BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION, but in my log there is only the entry which I print before the transaction begins. So it looks like it fails as soon as It opens up the distributed transaction.  The pic below shows the error I get from SSIS, but I have no idea what to do about it. Any idea is very much appreciatedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7Isl0.jpg altSSIS Error MSG  p  pError SSIS Error Code DTSEOLEDBERROR.  An OLE DB error has occurred. Error code 0x80040E14.

Negative 88458 pI have an issue currently that the validate method of the actionform happens before the execute method of the action. p  pThe reason this is an issue is that a user can submit their own request and should they have all required fields completed the validate passes and using the isTokenValidrequest method I can see that the request is invalid. and forward them to an access denied page. However if they do not complete all required fields in their forged request the validate method returns errors and they are forwarded to the actual page.jsp with error messages displayed.p  pAny idea how to prevent thisp

But for the php, a hrefhttpsoloentertainment.orgindex.php relnofollowSoloentertainment.orgindex.phpa, i dont have all links working so the projects page and bout leads to the html links but the home should be highlighted like in the original home page. p  pCode for the index.phpp  precodeltbody bgcolor000000 idhomegt     ltdiv aligncentergt         lttable classcontentTable gt             lttbodygt                 lttrgt                     lttd colspan0 border0 height50px aligncentergt                         ltphp includemessage.php gt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttd colspan0 border0 height125px aligncentergt                         ltphp includeheader.php gt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                             ltphp includenavbar.php gt                 lttrgt                     ltphp includehome.phpgt              lttbodygt         lttablegt     ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pCode for the Navbar.phpp  precode                lttd idnavbargt                         ltulgt                             ltli onclicklocation.hrefhttpwww.soloentertainment.orgindex.php classhome titleHomegtHomeltligt                             ltli classprojects titleProjectsgtProjectsltligt                             ltli classabout titleAboutgtAboutltligt                             ltligtContactltligt                         ltulgt                 lttdgt codepre  pThe original index.htmlp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt ltlink relshortcut icon hreffavicon.icogt lttitlegtSolo Entertainmentlttitlegt ltheadgt ltstylegt .contentTable  width 795px borderleft 10px borderleftcolor b7ad6f borderright 10px borderrightcolor b7ad6f margin 0px padding 0px  .header  backgroundcolor 000 backgroundrepeat norepeat backgroundposition right  navbar  width100 height30px backgroundcolor000   navbar ul  width50 margin0 auto 0 auto   navbar ul li  floatleft color FFF padding0 20px 0 20px border1px solid FFF height30px liststylenone displayblock lineheight30px textaligncenter cursorpointer    navbar ul lihover  backgroundcolorCCC color 000   home menu .home, projects menu .projects  backgroundcolorFFF color 111    ltstylegt ltbody bgcolor000000 idhomegt     ltdiv aligncenter idmenugt         lttable classcontentTablegt             lttbodygt                 lttrgt                     lttd colspan2 border0 height55px aligncentergt                         ltfont colorFF0000 size2gtThis site is still being built.

Negative 88458 pIm making a simple expect script that will monitor the output of tcpdump for a list of multicast addresses. I want to know if packets are received or not from each multicast address in the list before expect times out.p  pI have a working solution, but it is inefficient and I believe Im not utilizing the full power of expect and tcl. Anyway here is my current scriptp  precodeset multicastlist 225.0.0.1 225.0.0.2 225.0.0.3  send tcpdump i ixp1r  If tcpdump does not start, unzip it and run it again expect    tcpdump listening on ixp1    sh tcpdump not found      send gunzip usrsbintcpdump.gzr     expect       send tcpdump i ixp1r     expcontinue      Set timeout to the number of seconds expect will check for ip addresses set timeout 30 set found [list] set notfound [list] foreach ip multicastlist    expect      gt ip  lappend found ip      timeout  lappend notfound ip      set timeout 5  Send c to stop tcpdump send  003 expect   codepre  pSo as you can see the script will look for each ip address one at a time and if the ip is seen it will add it to the list of found addresses. If expect times out it will add the address to the notfound list and search for the next address.p  pNow back to my question Is there a way in which I can monitor tcpdump for all IP addresses simultaneously over a given amount of time. If the address were to be found I want to add it to the list of found addresses and ideally stop expecting it this may not be possible, Im not sure. The key is I need the script to monitor for all IPs in the list in parallel. I cant hard code each address because they will be different each time and the amount of addresses I am looking for will also vary. I could really use some help from an expect guru lol.p  pThank Youp

Negative 88458 pThis is a bit of a tricky one to explain, but lets say I have two classes codeAcode and codeBcode. codeAcode contains a codestaticcode list of factory objects that are registered by each object that provides such a factor. In this example codeBcode is such a class and provides an imaginary codeFactorycode implementation.p  pClass Ap  precodepublic class A      protected static MapltString, Factorygt registered  new HashMapltString, Factorygt     protected static registerString name, Factory factory          registered.putname, factory           public A           Do something with the factories weve registered       codepre  pClass Bp  precodepublic class B      static          A.registerFoo, new Factory              public Object create                  return new B                                 public B           Create a new instance of class B       codepre  pIn my program for some strange reason the static block within codeBcode is never called, so when I start interacting with codeAcode no factories have been registered so it cant do what it needs to do.p  pIf I move the creation of each codeFactorycode into codeAcode directly there is no problem of course. Im working under the assumption that because there are no clear references to codeBcode from any class that the compiler isnt recognising theres a link between codeAcode and codeBcode so doesnt bother with codeBcode at all. Is there anything I can do to work around this Id hoped to avoid adding each new factory into codeAcode directly as it makes maintenance more difficult than having new factories simply register themselves, but clearly having none of them work at all is even worse still, Id like to somehow get it to work as intended if I can.p  pIn case its relevant, the particular JVM Im working with is the Android JVM, could this be a sideeffect of some optimisation that that that JVM is usingp

Negative 88458 pMy app code components often calls upon dependent components that sport asynchronous methods that return Q.js promises. Id like to write synchronous test of such outer components whenever possible ... mostly because synchronous tests are more readable but also because it can be almost impossible to know when a dependent component is ready as discussed belowp  pIve designed the dependent components so I can configure them to behave synchronously when under test. But their APIs still return Q.js promises. Even though such a promise will be fully resolved immediately e.g., codereturn Qsomedatacode, Q guarantees that the promise wont actually resolve until the next tick. This properly ensures asynchronous behavior even when the timetoresolution is effectively zero.p  pI get it.p  pBut that means I cant write synchronous tests for the app components and I cant control when the readytogo promises resolve. I cant test the code at all when the dependent component doesnt expose the promise to the caller ... which it should not do when the method of the dependent component API should be fireandforget as is often the case.p  pIt would be great if my test could tell Q that a tick had occurred, thus causing it to attempt to resolve queued promises. This idea is inspired by Angulars q which has this feature baked in you call codescope.applycode for just this purpose.p  pI dont see any way to trigger a tick in Q today. For sure I do NOT want to monkeypunch codesetTimeoutcodep  pIs there a way I dont know about Would this be a good featurep

Negative 88458 pIm coding a physics simulation consisting mainly of a central loop of hundreds of billions of repetitions of operations on an array.

Negative 88458 pWe currently have a small web app, part of which is file uploads. Currently we are using a hrefhttpwww.plupload.com relnofollowPluploada on the client with chunking enabled to allow large files be uploaded. The files are saved on the app server and the chunks are appended as they come up.p  pNow we are moving to a hrefhttpaws.amazon.coms3 relnofollowAmazon S3a for file storage with the possiblity of multiple app servers. Im finding it difficult how to handle these chunks. I was trying to follow a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAmazonS3latestdevllJavaUploadFile.html relnofollowtheir examplea, but Im running into problems. The meat of what Im trying looks like thisp  precodeUploadPartRequest uploadRequest  new UploadPartRequest     .withBucketNamebucket.withKeykey     .withUploadIduploadId.withPartNumberpartNumber     .withPartSizebytes.length     .withInputStreamnew ByteArrayInputStreambytes  s3Client.uploadPartuploadRequest codepre  pThe problem Im having is that I need to somehow know the uploadId of the chunk. I have it when I get the codeInitiateMultipartUploadResultcode from the initializing of the upload, but how do I associate that with later chunks that come up I thought I could perhaps send it down with the first response, and then send it back up with each chunk request. That didnt seem like too far of reach.p  pThen I found that in order to complete the upload I need a codeListltPartETaggtcode with the codePartETagcodes getting returned from each upload to Amazon S3. So, my next question was how do I save all of these codePartETagcodes while the chunks are being uploaded from the browser My first thought was I could send down the codePartETagcode of each chunk in the response, and then store those client side. Im not sure if theres a way of knowing when the last chunk is being uploaded, so that I can send up all these codePartETagcodes. IF theres not, Id just have to send up all the ones I have each time, and then only the last request would use them. This all seems to be a little hacky to me.p  pSo, Im thinking someone has to have dealt with this before. Is there a good, standard way of doing thisp  pI thought about constructing the file on the app server and then sending it over to S3, but with multiple app servers, the chunks arent guaranteed to end up in the same place.p  pAnother thought Ive had is to store all this information in the database during the upload, but I wasnt sure I wanted to have to go hit the database with each chunk request. Are there any other options besides thisp  pI appreciate any help anyone can provide.p

Subquery 3 gives me student scores in english   say table 3br The tables contain scores only if student has taken that test and student is to be considered failed if heshe has not taken test at allor score lt passing score. I have student IDsunique for a person in each table to join on.p  pWhat I want from thesebr I am trying to build a dynamic query where some parts are populated at runtime by some external mechanism by performing some joins on these tables to give mebr 1.

How do I do thisp  pBefore you go ahead and suggest codetable 1 left join table 2 left join table 3code, this structure will cause problems if say table 2 contains a null record for a particular student as per my knowledge.

Negative 88458 pIs there a reasonable way to detect Gimbal beacons, when the app is in backgroundbr My current solution is to start the Gimbal service when the app launches and also start the visit manager. That way I receive events each time I get into the area of a beacon even in background.br I believe there must be a more elegant solution because I cannot keep the service always started, searching for visits. Also, I observed that the manager will stop sending callbacks at some point. p  pWhen do you think is better to startstop the service and startstop the visit manager if I always want to be informed about beacons visits background includedp

Negative 88458 pQuite a few concepts related to character set are mentioned in the standard basic source character set, basic execution character set, basic execution widecharacter set, execution character set, and execution widecharacter setp  ul liBasic source character set 91 graphical characters, plus space character, HT, VT, FF, LF just borrowing name abbreviations from ASCII.  li liBasic execution widecharacter set all members of basic source character set, plus BEL, BS, CR, wideNUL.  li liThe execution character set and the execution widecharacter set are implementationdefined supersets of the basic execution character set and the basic execution widecharacter set, respectively. The values of the members of the execution character sets and the sets of additional members are localespecific.li ul  pI dont have much question for basic source character set, basic execution character set, and basic execution widecharacter set.p  pAs for execution character set, the standard says its implementationdefined and localespecific, so I tried to get some real sense by observing the byte contents of a stringliteralinitialized char array whose value should equal to the numerical value of the encoding of the characters in the execution character set and a universalcharactername may map to more than one char element due to multibyte encodingp  precodechar str[]  Greek lowercase alpha is u03B1. codepre  pIt seems that its almost always utf8 on Linux codeCE B1code is stored in the array for that Greek letter. On Windows, its Windows1252 if system locale is English some wrong value code3Fcode is stored since Greek is not available in Windows1252, and some other encoding for other locale e.g. codeA6 C1code in cp936 for Chinese locale, codeE1code in Windows1253 for Greek locale, representing Greek lowercase alpha in those two encodings respectively.  For all those cases where the Greek letter is available in the locale thus available in the execution character set, codecout ltlt strcode can print the Greek letter appropriately.  All seems alright.p  pBut for execution widecharacter set, I dont understand very well. What is its exact encoding on major platforms It seems that the ISO10646 value code0x3B1code of the Greek lowercase alpha always gets stored in the codewchattcode for a declaration like the one below on all the platforms that I triedp  precodewchart wstr[]  LGreek lowercase alpha is u03B1.  codepre  pSo I guess the execution widecharater set may well be UCS2UTF16 or UTF32 different environment has different size for codewchartcode, 4 for Linux and 2 for Windows mostly  However, codewcout ltlt wstrcode doesnt print the Greek letter correctly on either Linux or Windows.  Surely the members and encoding of the execution widecharacter set is implementationdefined, but that shouldnt be a problem for the implementationprovided codeiostreamcode facility to recognize and handle that appropriately, right  While execution character set is also implementationdefined, the codeiostreamcode facility can handle it alright.  What is the default interpretation of a codewchartcode array when handled by codeiostreamcode facilities  Anyway, just to clarify, Im more interested in the nature of the execution widecharacter set, rather than finding a correct way to print a widecharacter string on certain platforms.p  pPS Im a total novice for codewchartcode stuffs, so my apology if I said something very wrong.p

Negative 88458 pI am trying to implement object picking. I have code to render the objects as solid, unlit colors, then I read the pixels in the screen buffer. I interpret the readings from codeglReadPixelscode to determine which object the cursor is currently on. Finally, I rerender everything lit, textured, and colored.p  precode    gl.glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT     gl.glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW     gl.glLoadIdentity     gl.glPushMatrix      Picking render goes here...      gl.glPopMatrix        The following code reads the current pixel color at the center of the screen     FloatBuffer buffer  FloatBuffer.allocate4      gl.glReadBufferGLFRONT     gl.glReadPixelsdrawable.getWidth  2, drawable.getHeight  2, 1, 1, GLRGBA, GLFLOAT, buffer     float[] pixels  new float[3]     pixels  buffer.array     float red  pixels[0]     float green  pixels[1]     float blue  pixels[2]     System.out.printlnred  ,   green  ,   blue        gl.glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT     gl.glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW     gl.glLoadIdentity     gl.glPushMatrix      Final render goes here...      gl.glPopMatrix codepre  pThe problem is that the call to codeglReadPixelscode returns me the pixel color of the FINAL render, rather than the picking render. I would appreciate an explanation of how to read the picking render pixels.p  pI am aware that I can use the OpenGL name stack, but frankly I find it inconvenient and ridiculous.p

Negative 88458 pI have an array of integers which is updated every set interval of time with a new value lets call it data. When that happens I want to check if that array contains any other array of integers from specified set lets call that collection.  I do it like this p  ul liseparate a subarray from the end of data of length X arrays in the collection have a set max length of Xli liiterate trough the collection and check if any array in it is contained in the separated data chunkli ul  pIt works, though it doesnt seem optimal. But every other idea I have involves creating more collections e.g. create a collection of all the arrays from the original collection that end with the same integer as data, repeat. And that seems even more complex on the other hand, it looks like the only way to deal with arrays in collections without limited max length.p  pAre there any standard algorithms to deal with such a problem If not, are there any worthwhile optimizations I can apply to my approach p  pEDIT To be precise, Ip  ul liseparate a subarray from the end of data of length X arrays in the collection have a set max length of X and if the dont its just the length of the longest one in the collectionli liiterate trough the collection and for every array in it ul liseparate subarray from the previous subarray with length matching current array in collectionli liuse Javas List.equals to compare the arraysli ulli ul  pEDIT 2 Thanks for all the replays, surely theyll come handy some day. In this case I decided to drop the last steps and just compare the arrays in my own loop. That eliminates creating yet another subarray and its already ON, so in this specific case will do. p

Negative 88458 pIs their a way to get the next full character in a multibyte string for example zu00dfu6c34U0001d10b or z would be represented as 4 characters excluding null termination in a widestring but maybe 9 characters in a multibyte string. I was using the below code to convert to and from string, since I used widestirng internally, but their seems to be subtle issues if the proper length is not given for the wideToString even if the length is larger than it needs to be. I have also realized that I can probably skip the whole conversion to and from wstring, by using only string, if I can simply get how many characters in the multibyte string makes up the next full character. So say in string u8u6c34U0001d10b which may be stored in 6 characters I would only want the next 2 which would be .

Negative 88458 pI upgraded from UR 11 to UR 12 this week and when testing my environment im coming up with some issues. I already ran the Custom Code Validation Tool and fixed most of the possible JS related issues and changed the code to use XrmServiceToolkit instead of CrmServiceToolkit. Below is the message im getting everytime I try and save and my JS run a XrmServiceToolkit.Soap.Create of a Service Activity SA record. The message I believe is related to the assignment of a team record to the owner field of the SA, since if I remove this assignment the error doesnt appear. p  pWhat can be the issue causing this  p  pIve seen a couple of issues like this but related to plugins and not to JS. I also diabled all custom plugins that would run on a creation of a SA so no plugins should be firing at the same time of the Create being done. p  precodeMicrosoft Dynamics CRM Error Report Contents  ltCrmScriptErrorReportgt ltReportVersiongt1.0ltReportVersiongt ltScriptErrorDetailsgt ltMessagegtThe formatter threw an exception while trying to deserialize the message   There was an error while trying to deserialize parameter httpschemas.microsoft.comxrm2011ContractsServicesentity.

Specifically, exception handler methods which metaprogrammed onto a controller class are not supported.p blockquote  pSource a hrefhttpgeekswithblogs.netzakariacsearchive20140706grailsbasiccontrollerspart4.aspx relnofollowhttpgeekswithblogs.netzakariacsearchive20140706grailsbasiccontrollerspart4.aspxap  pAdding a method just for the testing is one of my solution but I think that it is not a good practice to make it exposed in the development or production environment. Is there any ways to make it available only in test environmentp

This would be done by specialising codeBcode so that codeTcode is of a certain type, which can then be converted. How that works in detail is explained below, including the complete code snippet.p  pIf this question is badly worded or hard to understand, please help me improve it. This is one of the most complex template problems Ive been working on English is not my native language.p  hr  h2Why the madnessh2  pAs a bit of an exercise, I want to write a template construct that allows me to call codeprintfcode and similar functions that require codechar[]codes with codestdstringcodes.p  pFor that, I have to iterate through every single argument, and specialise for the case that it may be a codestdstringcode. In order to do that, I have a struct codefwdlttypename funct, typename ... LeftArgsgtcode, which contains all arguments that have been processed, and inside that a struct codeonearglttypename Arg, typename ... RightArgsgtcode that allows the processing of the current argument by being specialised for the empty base case and the case that codeArgcode is codestdstringcode. The base case no arguments, or none left to process, is handled like thisp  precodetemplatelttypename ...gt struct onearg      implementation of returntype will be shown below     static returntype forwardfunct func, LeftArgs ... leftArgs         return funcleftArgs ... execute function       codepre  pSpecialising the base case is the common case that an argument has any type except codestdstringcodep  precodetemplatelttypename Arg, typename ...

Negative 88458 pIn my UI application, I allow user to specify the Date format as per his choice which I use the same in further processing to format the dates. I want to separate the date part and time part from the pattern that is specified by the user. e.g. user specifies ddMMMyyyy HHmmss then I would like to divide the date part i.e. ddMMMyyyy and time part i.e. HHmmss. I know I can use SimpleDateFormat.toPattern method which gives me entire format and then can do string manipulation. But I want to avoid that since user may give some ridiculous pattern such as yyyyHHssdd MMMmm. In such case it would be very difficult to differentiate what represents date part and what is time part.p  pIs there a standard java API method which does this I checked the API but couldnt find it.

Negative 88458 pI have enabled the Approval workflow in SharePoint Server 2010 and added it to a document library. When I add a document to the library, I get notified that a task has been created for approval. Thats all good. When I open the task and click Approve, the workflow tries to send an email to the sys admin user which doesnt have an email account, so that creates an error. Then it creates a new task for the sys admin account which can never be completed since that user doesnt have an Outlook account. So at that point, the workflow is stuck. I have looked over the workflow configuration multiple times and there is no mention of the sys admin user anywhere. Any ideas as to why this user is being included in the workflowp

Negative 88458 pI have two large matrices and I want to calculate a similarity score between the two. However, there are some columns in these matrices that contain gaps so what I did was write a function that creates a score matrix 1 for similarity 0 for dissimilarity then created codegapscode and codenogapscode vectors from the matrix and calculated the score accordinglybr The scoring part of the function is seen below  p  precode  ScoreMat lt align1  align2    find gaps and nogaps   gaps   lt whichalign1  , arr.inTRUE   gaps   lt gaps[,2]   gaps   ltgaps[duplicatedgaps ]   nogaps lt 1ncolalign1   nogaps lt nogaps[gaps]    split ScoreMat into gaps and nogaps matrices   ScoreMatgaps     lt ScoreMat[,gaps]   ScoreMatNogaps   lt ScoreMat[,nogaps]    calculate score   gapScore   lt rowSumsScoreMatgaps   nogapScore lt rowSumsScoreMatNogaps   score      lt cbindgapScore,nogapScore codepre  pThe problem starts when I want to score specific column ranges that I am more interested in than the others. So the greater function contains lines on how to score these specific ranges. However, some of these ranges contain gaps, others do not. So for the ranges that have gaps, the function works properly. But with the ranges that do not have gaps, the codegapscode vector returns as codeinteger0code and for some reason, the codenogapscode vector gives that result as well.  p  pMy attempt at fixing the issue included using an if statement as follows  p  precode  gaps   lt whichalign1  , arr.inTRUE   gaps   lt gaps[,2]   gaps   lt gaps[duplicatedgaps ]   nogaps lt 1ncolalign1   nogaps lt ifelse lengthgaps  0, nogaps, nogaps[gaps] codepre  pBut this leads to codenogapscode to be equal to 1p  pWhy is the if statement giving this result, and how do I fix itp  pThanks in advance p

Negative 88458 pI am attempting to optimise a bulk UPDATE statement in Postgres using the UPDATE..FROM syntax to update from a list of values. It works except when the same row might be updated more than once in the same query.p  pFor example say I have a table test with columns key and value.p  precodeupdate test as t set value  v.value from values      key1, update1,      key1, update2       as v key, value  where t.key  v.key codepre  pMy desired behavior is for the row with key key1 to be updated twice, finishing with value set to update2. In practice sometimes the value is updated to update1 and sometimes to update2. Also an update trigger function on the table is only invoked once.p  pThe documentation a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.1staticsqlupdate.html relnofollowhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.1staticsqlupdate.htmla explains whyp  blockquote   pWhen a FROM clause is present, what essentially happens is that the target table is joined to the tables mentioned in the fromlist, and each output row of the join represents an update operation for the target table. When using FROM you should ensure that the join produces at most one output row for each row to be modified. In other words, a target row shouldnt join to more than one row from the other tables. If it does, then only one of the join rows will be used to update the target row, but which one will be used is not readily predictable.p      pBecause of this indeterminacy, referencing other tables only within subselects is safer, though often harder to read and slower than using a join.p blockquote  pIs there any way to reformulate this query to achieve the behavior Im looking for Does the reference to subselects in the documentation give a hintp

Negative 88458 pI am using DynamicGrid library to implement gridview in android. For deleting an item, I animate it by scaling out the view first and reordering the remaining items in gridview to the correct position. But how to notify the adapter about this deletion If I remove the item from the adapter before starting the animation, notifydataset is invoked which changes the view and hence animation is not what is desired. If I remove the item on animation end, wrong object is removed. I am not sure what to do and how to fix this I want to ensure that animation is shown correctly and only after that adapter is notified about this changep
Negative 88458 pI have found out that Doxygen does not trace C exceptions it does it for Java.p  pPlease skip statements that you can never be certain as to whether a function throws an exception, as it can also pop up from codebsearchcode  I know. This doesnt matter much for me  Doxygen isnt perfect anyway and I dont expect it to be perfect, I just expect it to be useful.p  pI just need some solution that can trace the call graphs  which Doxygen actually does indeed, at least when generating data for drawing a callcaller graph  and find out what exceptions are thrown from particular function. Its enough that it trace just those functions whichs code it can see and it can see an explicit throw there  and every function which has it, as well as every function that calls such a function, is declared that it throws an exception of specified type.p  pDoes anybody know something like that, at least that can give me any automatonreadable text form report that I can at least use to add throws tags in Doxygen documentationp

Negative 88458 pIm writing an iOS app in Objective C. In one my classes a View Controller, I have 2 different functions. Each of these functions, within it, has a call to an animation UIView animateWithDuration. Lets call these functions Function A and Function B, and the animations they call within themselves Animation A and Animation B respectively. Animation A is sort of long and delayed, while B is pretty quick.p  pI absolutely need the animation in Function B to only start running once the animation in Function A completes. i.e. Animation B has to run after Animation A completes. p  pI CANNOT call Animation B from Animation As completion block, because Animation B needs parameters available only to Function B in order to runp  precodeFunctionA      AnimationA   Function Bx, y, z      AnimationBx, y, z  codepre  pHow on earth do I solve this problem Ive tried creating a new separate queue and then stacking the Animation A and B calls on that, but it still doesnt work. What inevitably seems to happen is that, Im guessing the actual UIView animateWithDuration call will invariably spawn its own thread, and so the block of code that runs it that I place on the queue will return as completed even while its still going on, because its the completion handler that is anyways going to run when its done which I cant use for the reason mentioned previously.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 88458 pI have attempted this over and over, but Im now just going in circles.p  pI have a set of mostly unique job files stored externally, from these files Im collection information and storing it in my program via a List.p  pOn occasion, I have two job files named the same this unfortunately cant be avoided but containing different data the most unique of which is a DateTime string.p  pMy program works by polling 3 locations for these files all locations are mirrored so the same data is present in each, collecting the information then outputting the info to a ListView window dependent on current status of each job file.p  pThe issue Im having is preventing duplicate entries being added to my List resulting in 69 objects in the list for only 23 jobs files.p  pTo avoid having duplicates output in the listview, I attempted to use a dictionary to store known keys based on the job file name, however this falls over when reaching the second file that is named the same as an existing entry. Resulting in me only seeing 21 jobs in a list that should contain 23 I also get an exception thrown. I got around this by appending something to the end of the second entry, but this isnt ideal, and was found to cause other complications later on.p  pAny ideasp  pHeres what I have so far.p

Be careful when applying two or more mutexes to a section of code. If the first pthreadmutexlock is applied and the second pthreadmutexlock fails due to another thread applying a mutex, the first mutex may eventually lock all other threads from accessing data including the thread which holds the second mutex. The threads may wait indefinitely for the resource to become free causing a deadlock. It is best to test and if failure occurs, free the resources and stall before retrying.p  precode01  ... 02  pthreadmutexlockampmutex1 03  while  pthreadmutextrylockampmutex2    Test if already locked    04   05     pthreadmutexunlockampmutex1   Free resource to avoid deadlock  06         ... 07      stall here    08     ... 09     pthreadmutexlockampmutex1 10   11  count 12  pthreadmutexunlockampmutex1 13  pthreadmutexunlockampmutex2 14  ... codepre  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 88458 pI have a Rails application in which I am trying to replace some views with AngularJS, but not all. In each view I replace, I want it to basically act as if it is its own SPA. I am also trying to use uirouter to manage states within each of these SPAs.p  pFor example, I have a Rails route that maps to a view ...checkout1. This triggers a Rails view in which I load the initial SPA for the flow and then let angular take over. I would like to setup uirouter states that are just specific to this checkout flow.p  pWhere I am getting stuck is how to have states that are only specific for that flow with that base url. If I setup the statesp  precodestateProvider     .statestart,          url ,         templateUrl ...          .stateroute2,          url route2,         templateUrl ...          .stateroute3,          url route3,         templateUrl ...      codepre  pThis works and for ...checkout1, ...checkout1route2, ...checkout1route3.p  pHowever, it also work in my other SPA views which I do not want. So, if I do another rails view that uses another SPA, e.g. ...item1 then the above route will also work for ...item1 and ...item1route2, etc.p  pInstead, I would like each to be its own SPA and not conflict with each other. I am not sure how to do this. Can uirouter be somehow namespaced using the base url or can I have independent SPAs that have different stateProviders Any thoughts on how I should go about thisp  pThanksp

Negative 88458 pI am trying to write a yarn application and was hoping to get some suggestions on a few design questions I had in mind. I have gone through the simpler sample apps like distributed shell and some variations of it so I am familiar with the basic API. What I would like to do is create an application that has a web interface which user can interact with and potentially provide some kind of tasks nature of tasks is irrelevant. Based on that work, the UI requests containers to do the processing. p  pThe ideal arrangement that comes to my mind is that my application master provides this web UI and no containers are allocated until someone comes to the AM website and requests some work. At this point, AM should be able to register new containers and allocate work to them. p  ol liIf the AM provides the web UI and my understanding is that AM is chosen by RM every time the application is submitted to RM. That means the AM can have a different IP and, therefore, a different URL upon application restart. Does this behavior suggests that AM should not be used for such purpose and potentially a completely different application nonyarn can provide the web UI and is better suited for itli liIn all the examples, I have seen for sample yarn apps AM requests for containers as part of its invocation. Can someone please point to the AM related APIs that allow essentially requesting containers at a later time or potentially lets say modifying the resource requirements memory of already claimed containers or even increasing the number of containers on demandli liSimilar to last point, most examples focus on yarn application that do something and then end. As you can imagine my application would make sense to continue to run forever as its a web app. For these long running application does the Client to RM api changes. Is it ok to disconnect the client submission job process or start it using amp to run it in backgroundli ol  pI would appreciate any suggestionsp

And if it is not, can you suggest me the appropriate tech to use for this project to be feasible I prefer ASP.NET MVCp  pA little detail about the functionality of the project br  Has User Authentication  this user will have a simple SMS box type of thing which will update like a chatbox if an SMS is received in the GSM modem and this user can reply and use the GSM to send the SMS back to the sender.p  pIF anyone could help me, guide me, point me to some reading materials to make this project it would be greatly appreciated. Please post if you need clarifications and further explanation. Thanksp

Whats the best way to deal with this Since Im mostly doing UI updates, Id rather keep it all on the main thread, which seems to rule out using a serial thread via GCD. I thought I could set up a class property using some kind of locking technique  would this be the way forward Would this be an appropriate use of codesynchronizecode with a block likep  precodesynchronizedself       ifself.dismissed        put function body with appropriate control statements here         codepre  pBut then I am locking up the entire instance just to access one property. Or would this be a better use for codeNSLockcode which I am not particularly familiar with either In the past Ive only been using GCD, but I dont know how to control flow on the main thread with GCD.p  pSo question Is codesynchronizecode the way to go, or if not what is a method that would do what I need in a reasonably efficient mannerp
Negative 88458 pHow to measure actual bandwidth between server and client to decide how much of realtime data to sendp  pMy server sends readtime data to clients, 30 times per second. If server has too much data it prioritises data chunks and throws away anything that doesnt fit into available bandwidth because this data will be invalidated next tick anyway. Data is sent over reliable 20 and unreliable channels 80 both UDP based but if TCP as a reliable channel can provide any benefit please let me know. Data is highly latencysensitive. Server often but not always has more data than available bandwidth. Its critical to send as much data as possible but not more than available bandwidth to avoid packets drop or higher latency.p  pServer and client are custom applications so can implement any algorithmprotocol.p  pMy main problem is how to keep track of available bandwidth. Also any statistical info about typical bandwidth jitter would be helpful servers are in a cloud, clients are home users, worldwide.p  pAt the moment Im thinking how to utilizep  ul liplatency info of reliable channel. It should correlate with bandwidth because if latency grows this can  mean retransmission is involved as result of packets drop and so server must lower data rate. pli lipdata amount received by client on unreliable channel during time frame. Especially if data amount is lower than what was sent from server.pli lipif current latency is close to or below lowest recorded one, bandwidth can be increasedpli ul  pThe problem is that this approach is too complicated and involves a lot of heuristics like what should be a step to increasedecrease bandwidth etc.p  pLooking for any advice from people who dealt with similar problem in the past or just any bright ideasp

Negative 88458 pI have some groups and some items in Meteor.p  pEach item belongs to a group. The groups can actually be splitted in two where some of the groups belong to a group with a higher order in a hierarchy.p  pSo the hierarchy could look likep  precodeGroup 1     Subgroup 1     Subgroup 2     Subgroup 3 Group 2     Subgroup 1     Subgroup 2 Group 3     Supgroup 1 codepre  pThe items can only belong to a subgroup and never a main group. So I thought I could create a collection which only consists of subgroups and then have a field telling to which main group this subgroup belongs. But I also need to store additional information about the main groups such as its name, date range, etc., so maybe a better solution is to either create two collections codeMainGroupcode and codeSubGroupcode, and have a codeSubGroupIdcode field in codeItemcode. But since the two type of groups are almost equal, I think I can make a schema structure where the subgroups are child objects of a main group.p  pHow do you normally create the data structure of such app Ideally, it would also be possible to have nested groups someday.p

Negative 88458 pThis question is admittedly similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27365575howtoexitashinyappandreturnavaluethis questiona but the answer provided is not sufficient for my example.p  pI am creating a Shiny App that connects to a database.  The user can provide some inputs and some canned queries will run.  Now, I would like to make certain the connection to the database is closed on exit from the app.  I could use a button and the codestopAppcode function but this assumes users will be good and always click said button.  Users are likely to sometimes close the window leaving the database connection open so I would like to find a way to explicitly close the connection when the user closes the app window.p  pI suppose one solution would be to instantiate a new connection and close at the end of each query but that seems inefficient.p  pHere is some working code to demonstrate the problem.

Negative 88458 pI have a question concerning styling elements on retina display devices that I was hoping someone could help me with. Please excuse my ignorance but Ive been attempting to understand this for a couple of hours now to no avail.p  pLets say that I have an image with a 44px width on a normal device screen. On a 2x retina display device, I would therefore use an 88px width version of this same image for it to display at the same physical size. p  pHowever, lets say that this image has a marginleft of 10px, for example. Why do I not have to create a style for the 2x retina device stating that the margin left should also be doubled to 20px, considering the increased pixel densityp  pI thought that maybe some sort of conversion would be done by the OS of the device youre using  However, when researching this issue by connecting my iPhone to my Mac and checking out marginpaddingetc definitions to see if any of them were being doubled, I saw that they were not being changed from what was defined in my stylesheet for nonretina devices. p  pHow can 16px of padding on a nonretina and 2x retina device look the same p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong  I researched this issue and think I have a better understanding of it now.

Negative 88458 pIm running two different postgres 9.3 instances one for production, one for developmenttesting. I want to copy a subset of a table in production into development.p  pLets say then that the table I want to copy is defined as p  precodeCREATE TABLE users userid varchar PRIMARY KEY, otherstuff varchar codepre  pand the subset I want to copy is all the users who have userid in a cached table on production, which is a much smaller table than the users tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE useridsubset userid varchar PRIMARY KEY codepre  pIve set up some foreign tables on my development db to access these two tables named foreignusers, and foreignuseridsubset respectively, and I want to do a query likep  precodeINSERT INTO developmentusers userid, otherstuff      SELECT userid, otherstuff FROM foreignusers f     WHERE EXISTS          SELECT 1 FROM foreignuseridsubset ss          WHERE ss.useridf.userid codepre  pThis query works, but Im worried about performance. The result of an explain gives me something like thisp  precodeInsert on developmentusers cost262.01..284.09 rows138 width272   gt  Hash Join  cost262.01..284.09 rows138 width272         Hash Cond f.useridtext  cache.useridtext         gt  Foreign Scan on foreignusers f  cost100.00..118.28 rows276 width272         gt  Hash  cost159.52..159.52 rows200 width32               gt  HashAggregate  cost157.52..159.52 rows200 width32                     gt  Foreign Scan on foreignuseridsubset  cost100.00..153.86 rows1462 width32 codepre  pWhat I emthinkem is happening is that my development db sends the request to my production db, which creates the temp hash of foreignuseridsubset useridsubset on production and does the hash check on production. This way, the only thing that gets sent across the wire between the databases is the initial request, and then the result of the select query. Is this true p  pAn alternative idea would be to create a temp cant be a true TEMP table bc I need a foreign table of the result of this request on my production database, and then build a foreign table and just do a SELECT  from development on the foreign table. p  pIt should be noted that my production database is a much pricierperformant RDS instance than my development databasep

Negative 88458 pIve currently got a single working codeUISearchControllercode implemented inside the header view of a codeUITableViewControllercode. I wish for my other views to also follow suit but some are codeUICollectionViewControllercodes. Is there a way to create one codeUISearchControllercode and just call them across all the views within the headers All of the results must show in a table. p  pI had attempted to create one for each view but the codeUICollectionViewControllercode was giving me some problems. I couldnt figure out how to set and update a table for the search controller. It wouldnt allow me to override the codetableViewcode methods as i guess the controller is a codeCollectionViewcode. p  pAny help is appreciated. p  pEDITp  pShould also add that the search methoddata will be the same across all of the views. See how the stock iOS Music app uses search bars as an example. p  pEDIT 2p  pIve nearly cracked it I think. Ive setup a singleton SharingManager, within this i have 3 arrays. Now I have 2 views, one named ArtistsView and one SearchTableViewController. The Search view contains all of the table methods and the ArtistsView communicates with that using         p  blockquote   pself.searchResultsController  UISearchControllersearchResultsController SearchTableViewControllerp blockquote  pI also copy the variables within the singleton to variables that are within the SearchTableViewController. p  pThe issue im having now is that the cellForRowAtIndexItem method is not being called. All the other ones are, i can even see the section headings are being displayed. I have set up various println statements to see where i couldve gone wrong, the numberOfRowsInSection is also returning the correct numbers. Any ideas p

The output is the voltage in PWM for a L298N driver motor... the motors are Pololu type.p  pI have 2 LDRslight dependent resistor placed in an enclosure and when the light falls on them, in system appears a voltage difference. I want my Simulink model to read continuously LDRS values and calculate the errorp  precodeerror  LDRWest  LDREast codepre  pthen let the fuzzy logic controller do its job and feed the output back to the sum element..p  pI think you got my idea ..p

Negative 88458 pIn Herb Sutters a hrefhttpwww.gotw.capublicationsmill09.htmcodeWhen Is a Container Not a Containercodea, he shows an example of taking a pointer into a containerp  precode   Example 1 Is this code valid safe good      vectorltchargt v     ...    char p  ampv[0]     ... do something with p ... codepre  pThen follows it up with an improvementp  precode   Example 1b An improvement                  when its possible      vectorltchargt v     ...    vectorltchargtiterator i  v.begin     ... do something with i ... codepre  pBut doesnt really provide a convincing argumentp  blockquote   pIn general, its not a bad guideline to prefer using iterators instead   of pointers when you want to point at an object thats inside a   container. After all, iterators are invalidated at mostly the same   times and the same ways as pointers, and one reason that iterators   exist is to provide a way to point at a contained object. So, if you   have a choice, prefer to use iterators into containers.p      pUnfortunately, you cant always get the same effect with iterators   that you can with pointers into a container. There are two main   potential drawbacks to the iterator method, and when either applies we   have to continue to use pointersp      ol   lipYou cant always conveniently use an iterator where you can use a pointer. See example below.pli   lipUsing iterators might incur extra space and performance overhead, in cases where the iterator is an object and not just a bald   pointer.pli   ol blockquote  pIn the case of a vector, the iterator is just a RandomAccessIterator. For all intents and purposes this is a thin wrapper over a pointer. One implementation even acknowledges thisp  precode    This iterator adapter is normal in the sense that it does not     change the semantics of any of the operators of its iterator     parameter.  Its primary purpose is to convert an iterator that is     not a class, e.g. a pointer, into an iterator that is a class.     The Container parameter exists solely so that different containers     using this template can instantiate different types, even if the     Iterator parameter is the same. codepre  pFurthermore, the implementation stores a member value of type codeIteratorcode, which is codepointercode or codeTcode. In other words, just a pointer. Furthermore, the codedifferencetypecode for such a type is codestdptrdifftcode and the operations defined are just thin wrappers i.e., codeoperatorcode is codepointercode, codeoperatorcode is codepointercode and so on.p  pFollowing Sutters argument, this iterator class provides no benefits over pointers, only drawbacks. Am I correctp

Negative 88458 pI want to know if there is a way to make the codeRichEditControlcode as a codeMemoEditcode or just like a codeTextEditcode.p  pI will leave a picture to let you know what I need, all I can do at this moment is hide the rulers of the document. The picture have two controls, the one in the top is the codeRichControlEditcode, in the bottom a normal codeTextEditcode, who is the look that I need to have in the codeRichControlEditcodep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comLDokN.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLDokN.png altenter image description hereap
Negative 88458 pI have a very specific use case with MKMapView. I generate a big amount of MKPolygons about 15000 and render them on an overlay. To increase the performance I do following stepsp  ol liadd one single overlay to the map view which is of size of the wholeWorldli liIn  voiddrawMapRectMKMapRectmapRect zoomScaleMKZoomScalezoomScale inContextCGContextRefcontext I check every polygon if it is contained in the current MapRect because MapKit divides the map into tiles and renders them in parallel on different threadsli liIf the polygon is present in the current rect I create a CGPath and fill it with associated color.li ol  pEverything worked fine before I changed the blending mode to kCGBlendModeMultiply. After that, I observe some weird and arbitrary rendering artefacts which I can not explain. I made a few screenshots to describe the problemp  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimagelzj1swss9 relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimagelzj1swss9ap  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimagec0thsotyx relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimagec0thsotyxap  pHere is the code I use in  voiddrawMapRectMKMapRectmapRect zoomScaleMKZoomScalezoomScale inContextCGContextRefcontextp  precode voiddrawMapRectMKMapRectmapRect zoomScaleMKZoomScalezoomScale inContextCGContextRefcontext     [super drawMapRectmapRect zoomScalezoomScale inContextcontext]    CGContextSaveGStatecontext    CGContextSetBlendModecontext, kCGBlendModeMultiply     NSArray polygons  IndexPolygonsMapOverlay  self.overlay.polygons    autoreleasepool          for MYMKPolygonSubClass poly in polygons               if MKMapRectIntersectsRectpoly.boundingMapRect, mapRect                    continue                            if poly.color continue              CGContextSaveGStatecontext              CGContextSetFillColorWithColorcontext, poly.color.CGColor               CGContextMoveToPointcontext, CGFloat poly.points[0].x, CGFloat poly.points[0].y              for int idx  1 idx lt poly.pointCount idx                     CGContextAddLineToPointcontext, CGFloat poly.points[idx].x, CGFloat poly.points[idx].y                            CGContextClosePathcontext              CGContextDrawPathcontext, kCGPathFill              CGContextRestoreGStatecontext                 CGContextRestoreGStatecontext  codepre  pDid anyone have a similar experience with Multiply Blending Mode, expecially when using it on a MKMapViewp
