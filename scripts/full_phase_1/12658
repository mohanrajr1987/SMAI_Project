Positive 12658 pOn a Windows 10 box, why can I print the black flag U2691 character in certain places but not others cmd.exe in particularp  pUpdate with proposed hints in comments no answers yet  [From Kevin] CMD.exe Unicode support is dubious unspecified, but write off the issue I am having as strange CMD.exe behavior  [From Mark] The process should write to the ConsoleAPI instead of stdout.  [From Mr. Lister] Change the font.p  pI changed the font in Webstorm. It was using codemonospacedcode, and displayed the flag properly. I switched to codeConsolascode, codeLucida Sanscode, and codeCourier Newcode and it worked in all of them. I looked at a hrefhttpwww.fileformat.infoinfounicodefontlucidaconsolelist.htm relnofollowthe list of supported unicode chars for Lucida Consolea and indeed, U2691 is not on there. So Webstorm might have some fallback mechanism to support the character. p  pI ran ConEmu, and set the base font to Lucida Console, and Alternative font to DejaVu Sans, which I downloaded from a hrefhttpwww.fontsquirrel.comfontsdejavusans relnofollowherea. I had to adjust the Unicode range manually, setting it to 20133000. And voila, the black flag showed. So although part one is now kindof solved, I still dont really know what is going on with fonts vs graphics and code pages here. I think the codepage is a red herring when dealing with some unicode... So please, if someone has anything definitive, I would love a proper answer. p  pNote, I have the cmd.exe font set to Lucida Console and Current Code Page to UTF8 65001.

Negative 12658 pI am trying to place a link into an Extinfowindow that obtains its content through an Ajax call. So, I click on a push pin marker, up pops the Extinfowindow with my a hrefhttpjquery.comdemothickbox relnofollowThickBoxa  link in it, and when I inspect the DOM for the entire page at that point, I can see the  element correctly showing up with the thickbox class. The link looks like thisp  precodeltA classthickbox title hrefhttplocalhost1293Popup.aspx height200ampwidth300ampmodaltruegtModal PopupltAgt codepre  pHowever, when I click on it, it does a full refresh and the target page loads in the browser, not in a popup.

Negative 12658 pI suppose similar questions were already asked, but I was unable to find any. Please feel free to point me to an existing solutions.p  pIll explain my scenario. Id like to create a server application. There are many clients currently only a few dozens, but it should scale up to 1000 that connect to the server which is running on a single machine.p  pEach client periodically sends a small amount of data to the server to process processing is quick. The server can also send small amounts of data to each client on a regular basis. The response time should be low lt100 ms, but realtime or anything like that is not required.p  pMy first idea was back from when I was still programming in VB6 Create a server socket to listen to incoming requests, then create a client socket for each possible client singlethreaded. I doubt this scales well. It is also difficult to implement the communication.p  pSo I figured Id create a listener thread to accept new client connections and a different thread to actually read the incoming data by the clients. Since there are going to be many clients, I dont want to create a thread for each client. Instead, Id prefer to use a single thread to read all incoming data in a loop, then either processing these data directly or creating work items for a different thread to process. I guess this approach would scale well enough. Any comments on this idea are most welcome.p  pThe remaining problem Im worried about is easy of communication. The above solution seems to require a manual protocol, possibly sending ASCII commands via TCP. While this emwouldem work, I think there should be a better way nowadays.p  pSome interfaceproxyish way seems reasonable. I worked a bit with Java RMI before. From my point of understanding, .NET Remoting serves a similar purpose. Is Remoting a feasible solution to the scenario I described many clients Is there an even better way I dont know of yetp  pbEditbp  ul liThis is not in LAN, but internet, if that matters.li liIf possible, it should also run under Linux.li ul

Id rather deploy a Silverlight data entryOLTP tool. I also see that TM1 has unmanaged dlls that provide full access into the data engine.

Looking at other examples of Arduino MIDI for example, ema hrefhttpitp.nyu.eduphyscompLabsMIDIOutputMIDI Output using an Arduinoaem, they all seem to wire up a dedicated 5 pin DIN. Which makes sense as this is the original cable to connect keyboards, expanders and sequencers together.p  pHowever, I want to send MIDI to my PC. A 5pin DIN is just going to have to be plugged into a conversion box which connects to my PC via USB. And I already have a USB cable to connect my Arduino to my PC.

Whereas, say, a virtual synthesizer on my computer wouldnt expect or know how to handle raw bytes coming in via the serial port. So is there a standard or free equivalent to these drivers that I could use for my own project Or, if not, what would it take to write one Where could I find out more about thisp

Negative 12658 pI tried searching, but couldnt find any truly helpful links.p  pWe are implementing a set of WCF services.

I strongdo notstrong want to be required to pass usernamepassword on the initial or subsequent requests because in some cases the calling application server may not have the password. Windows and Kerberos are not usable in our specific circumstance.p  pI had thought to just create a simple custom UserNameSecurityTokenAuthenticator class and modify it so that if the password is empty, it takes userName as the stringencoded token value obviously checking the token itself to verify that its valid at that point, but if the password is not empty, forwarding on the usernamepassword to a MembershipProvider for checking. Basically Id like to overload the usernamepassword authentication to provide for token passing as well.p  pIs this possible Can I simply plug in a token authenticator like this, or is there some other simple way to intercept requests like this and update the actual username value from the decrypted tokenp  pOr is there some other incredibly simple way to allow the client to pass a custom token and have the server accept it that Im just missingp

One to get the Account object, and then one to get the Presence object.  We could easily knock this down to one request if we did the following p  precodevar presence  UserPresence.Getuser.id codepre  pThis works, but sort of requires developers to have an understanding of the UserPresence classmethods that would be nice to eliminate.p  pIve thought of a couple of cool ways to be able to handle this problem, and was wondering if anyone knows if these are possible, if there are other ways of handling this, or if we just need to think more as were coding and do the UserPresence.Get instead of using properties.p  ol lipOverload nested accessors.

Negative 12658 pI have a controlp  blockquote   pclass DragGrid  Grid      ...   p blockquote  pwhich inherits from the original grid and enables dragging and resizing its child elements. I need to bind a custom DP named strongcodeWorkItemsPropertycodestrong to an observable collection of type strongcodeWorkItemcodestrong implements codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode. Each element in the grid is bound to a collection item.p  pWhenever the user adds a new item dynamically at runtime the items cannot be declared in XAML, or deletes an item from that collection, the codeWorkItemscode DP on the DragGrid should be updated, and the children in the grid where each child represents a codeWorkItemcode collection item.p  pMy question is how does the DP notify the control about which child element in the grid must be strongremovedstrong, strongchangedstrong change means user dragged an element, or resized it with the mouse or strongaddedstrong, and how would I identify which one of the existing children is the one that needs to be deleted or changed. I understand that this is where the DependencyPropertyChangedCallback comes in. But that only gets called when the DP property is set anew, not when something inside the collection changes like add, remove item. So in the end, does the codeDragGridcode control somehow need to subscribe to the CollectionChanged event At what point would I hook up the event handler for thatp  pemstrongEDITstrong The reason for using a Grid in the first place is because I want to be able to maintain a minimum delta for when the user drags or resizes the control in the Grid. A control represents a time span, and each grid column represents 15min which is the minimum value. Doing this in a Canvas with Thumbs was difficult and buggy. Implementing a DragGrid solved my user interaction problems. Also, a Canvas is not scalable, so the time spans would have to recalculated all the time. With the Grid, I dont have the problem because the columns tell me the time no matter the size.emp

Negative 12658 pIm using SQL Server 2008 on Windows Server 2008 R2, all spd up.p  pIm getting occasional issues with SQL Server hanging with the CPU usage on 100 on our live server. It seems all the wait time on SQL Sever when this happens is given to SOSSCHEDULERYIELD.p  pHere is the Stored Proc that causes the hang. Ive added the WITH NOLOCK in an attempt to fix what seems to be a locking issue.p  precodeALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[MostPopularRead] AS BEGIN SET NOCOUNT ON  SELECT      c.ForeignId , ct.ContentSource as ContentSource     , sumch.HitCount  hw.Weight as Popularity     , sumch.HitCount  hw.Weight  100  Total as Percent     , Total as TotalHits from      ContentHit ch WITH NOLOCK     join [Content] c WITH NOLOCK on ch.ContentId  c.ContentId     join HitWeight hw WITH NOLOCK on ch.HitWeightId  hw.HitWeightId     join ContentType ct WITH NOLOCK on c.ContentTypeId  ct.ContentTypeId where      ch.CreatedDate between Then and Now group by     c.ForeignId , ct.ContentSource order by     sumch.HitCount  hw.HitWeightMultiplier desc END codepre  pThe stored proc reads from the table ContentHit, which is a table that tracks when content on the site is clicked it gets hit quite frequently  anything from 4 to 20 hits a minute. So its pretty clear that this table is the source of the problem. There is a stored proc that is called to add hit tracks to the ContentHit table, its pretty trivial, it just builds up a string from the params passed in, which involves a few selects from some lookup tables, followed by the main insertp  precodeBEGIN TRAN insert into [ContentHit]      ContentId, HitCount, HitWeightId, ContentHitComment values     ContentId, isnullHitCount,1, isnullHitWeightId,1, ContentHitComment COMMIT TRAN codepre  pThe ContentHit table has a clustered index on its ID column, and Ive added another index on CreatedDate since that is used in the select.p  pWhen I profile the issue, I see the Stored proc executes for exactly 30 seconds, then the SQL timeout exception occurs. If it makes a difference the web application using it is ASP.NET, and Im using Subsonic 3 to execute these stored procs.p  pCan someone please advise how best I can solve this problem I dont care about reading dirty data...p  pEDIT The MostPopularRead stored proc is called very infrequently  its called on the home page of the site, but the results are cached for a day. The pattern of events that I am seeing is when I clear the cache, multiple requests come in for the home site, and they all hit the stored proc because it hasnt yet been cached. SQL Server then maxes out, and can only be resolved by restarting the sql server process. When I do this, usually the proc will execute OK in about 200 ms and put the data back in the cache.p  pEDIT 2 Ive checked the execution plan, and the query looks quite sound. As I said earlier when it does run it only takes around 200ms to execute. Ive added MAXDOP 1 to the select statement to  force it to use only one CPU core, but I still see the issue. When I look at the wait times I see that XEDISPATCHERWAIT, ONDEMANDTASKQUEUE, BROKERTRANSMITTER, KSOURCEWAKEUP and BROKEREVENTHANDLER are taking up a massive amount of wait time. p  pEDIT 3 I previously thought that this was related to Subsonic, our ORM, but having switched to ADO.NET, the erros is still live.p

Negative 12658 pI am writing a problem resolver for a despatch app.p  pThe despatch app prints labels using a piece of software supplied by the UKs Royal Mail postal service. The software ensures that the addresses on the labels are correct as per the Royal mails database of valid addresses, it renders a trackable code in alphanumeric and barcoded format and it automatically bills our company for secure mail sent via the system without having to do very much paperwork.p  pIts the latter feature that causes a problem. If a label is printed and not required because a the customer is in a foreign country we do not mail to or b two orders are for the same person at the same address we want to either not print a label in the former case or print one of two in the latter.p  pThe country thing is easy. If a customer really is in another country you just dont include it in the list of customers sent to the Royal Mail app for processing but some customers get handy with the mouse wheel and end up pretending to be from the United Arab Emirates when theyre really from Banbury the Duplicate Postcode issue, however, is much more troublesome.p  pIn the UK two people will have the same postcode if they live on the same street. So obviously if two people on the same street want something you must print two labels. Similarly if two brothers live at the same address we want to ensure that both brothers receive their individual mail items in this case the postcode, house number and surname will all match. However if two orders exist at the same address for Mr AN Other then MR Other should only require one label and his despatches can be combined.p  pBelieve it or not we do have cases where Mr AN Other orders twice and Mr SomeotherDude in the same street orders something as well. In this case the problem resolver rather than just needing to tweak a predefined field to some other known value needs to let the user decide how many labels to print out.p  pIn order to model this scenario in a UI I have created a listbox with a dynamic datatemplate that either allows people to straight includenot include the country problem people but in the case of Postcode problems it presents a horizontally aligned listbox which should include all the orders that have the same postcode.p  pSo simply this is as far as I have got with thisp  precode   ltDataTemplate xKeypostcodeTemplategt             ltGridgt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltRowDefinitiongtltRowDefinitiongt                     ltRowDefinitiongtltRowDefinitiongt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                     ltColumnDefinitiongtltColumnDefinitiongt                     ltColumnDefinitiongtltColumnDefinitiongt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltLabel Grid.Row0gtThis Orders Postcode matches the postcode of another order.

Negative 12658 pI have a JavaEE6 application, consisting of Web stuff and EJBs and which is deployed as WARonly  using EJB3.1. The build is based on Maven. I just read about a new possibility to order the module initialization in Java EE 6 a hrefhttpwww.dzone.comlinksrmoduleinitializationorderinjavaee6.htmlherea which i also need for my application. Also, i would like to have an option to define some EJB properties in XML.p  pSince the example is deployed as an EARproject the order is defined in the application.xml. But in a WARdeployed project, there is no application.xml. Now i wonder where i can define such informations Or is it possible to use an application.xml somehow in a WARdeployedappp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOops i didnt read the moduleorderexample right, in the first moment i thought it was about in which order the EJBs in my app are loaded. Of course i have only one module in my WARapp, so ordering makes no sense. p  pOk, but as im at it, one big question remains also altered the question title to reflect the change What about the ejbjar.xml Can i somehow define stuff about my EJBs in XML as its useful for some settings, to avoid recompilationp
Negative 12658 pHey, I have a table called products that has a relationship with itself. This table stores products, their subproducts, and then subsubproducts. When a user searches for the topmost product, this query is supposed to return the parent, its children, and its childrens children. Now, my query works, but I am new to the entity framework and SQL in general, so I am not sure if this is the way it should be done. To make things a bit more hairy, I am searching against multiple fields in the table.p  precodeelse                              productQuery                       from b in solutionContext.Version                     where                                                       b.Product.Name  search  b.Product.Description  search                              b.Product.Product2.Name  search  b.Product.Product2.Description  search                              b.Product.Product2.Product2.Name  search  b.Product.Product2.Product2.Description  search                                              orderby b.Product.LastNumber ascending                     select b              codepre  pFor clarification, Product2 is the relationship that goes from the child to the parent.p  pSubquestion In the future I want to a search for a child, to return its parent, and parents parent. The way I would currently go about doing that is to add some lambda expressions and do what I did, but going up the relationship. Is that smartp

Negative 12658 pI got a weird problem. I have a program that does many things but also show pdf via axAcroPDF control. In the control, I hide the toolbar because I dont want the user to have access to them, so I made a Print button the only feature I want them to have access.p  pNow, I went throu the hell to find how to change the default printer because Adobe thought it would be smart to not allow to pass the printer path in their printAll function, go figure.p  pThere is 2 kind of paper, one cheap and one very expensive, so depending of what type of document, it will print on one printer else the other and must not screw up else it will be expensive.p  pSo here it goes, PrintA is the default printer for everything and PrintB is the expensive paper printer.p  pIf I print with PrintB, my program keep in memory the current default printer, switch the default printer to PrintB, print the document, then switchback to PrintA.  Problem is, after that if I try to print a normal document, it will print with PrintB even if PrintA is the default printer.p  pThe opposite is also true. If I print a normal document with PrintA first, after that, it will still use PrintA to print special documment.p  pThis will do it until I close the program. So I thought at first it was my program, but I debugged it and everything was fine. I even test with printWithDialog and first time it pass throu it, it will pop the dialog, but subsequent times it pass throu, it will do nothing Op  pSo I am totally lost on how to fix this and I feel I will need to give access to the toolbar and have them set the printer and amount of prints themselves which is a very very bad idea, you have no idea how dumb they are.p

Negative 12658 pI feel like MVC misses a letter to describe the situation in a game. The model to me seems to consist of two distinct partsp  ol liA group of vars that describe the current game state these will have setters that send out events on change, and getters so that the view can access what changedli liThe rules of the game that determine what happens once a certain input i.e. shoot has been received by the controller these will update the group of vars as deemed appropriateli ol  pThe view will exclusively be reading from 1 while the controller will be exclusively communicating with 2. This is why I make the distinction and want to divide them up into class1 and class2.p  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  ul liI am unsure if I should be making this distinction, since I havent seen it anywhere.li liIf I should should I make two separate classes, or should I extend class1 with class2li liFinally, I am having trouble making sure that only class2 and not the view can change the variables in class1 while still being able to send out an event when a value changes.

Negative 12658 pI feel like Im close to the answer, but Im not quite there. I have a command line program that I call from a PHP. I use shellexec, and it runs on a Windows machine running an Apache server.p  pWhen I run the script, I see in Task Manager on the Windows machine that the process has started, and then promptly stops doing anything. The process is still running, but it takes up about 17 MB of space and then the PHP script just sits there loading.p  pThe program is tiny 3MB and it can handle files well over that size, and its currently only handling one file thats 28 KB. When I call either one from a command prompt as the administrator, they work fine. When I call this one from shellexec, it doesnt. Ive also tried exec and passthru.p  pI have noticed that when PHP calls the program, it shows up under the SYSTEM user. Ive checked permissions on the Security tab of both the program and the file being processed by the program, and SYSTEM, Users, and Administrators all have full control over them.p  pWhat am I doing wrongp  pIf I need to run it as administrator instead of SYSTEM, how do I do thatp  pI can elaborate more if you have questions.p  pThank you so much, this has been killing mep

Negative 12658 pI am writing a CKY parser for a Range Concatenation Grammar. I want to use a treebank as grammar, so the grammar will be large. Ive written a prototype a hrefhttpwww.nltk.orgdownload relnofollow1a in Python and it seems to work well when I simulate a treebank of a couple tens of sentences, but the memory usage is unacceptable. I tried writing it in C but so far that has been very frustrating as I have never used C before. Heres some data n is number of sentences the grammar is based onp  precoden    mem 9    173M 18   486M 36   836M codepre  pThis growth pattern is what is to be expected given the bestfirst algorithm, but the amount of overhead is what concerns me. The memory usage according to heapy is a factor ten smaller than these numbers, valgrind reported something similar. What causes this discrepancy and is there anything I can do about it in Python or Cython Perhaps its due to fragmentation Or maybe it is the overhead of python dictionariesp  pSome background the two important datastructures are the agenda mapping edges to probabilities, and the chart, which is a dictionary mapping nonterminals and positions to edges. The agenda is implemented with a heapdict which internally uses a dict and a heapq list, the chart with a dictionary mapping nonterminals and positions to edges. The agenda is frequently inserted and removed from, the chart only gets insertions and lookups. I represent edges with tuples like thisp  precodeS, 111, NP, 010, VP, 100, 001 codepre  pThe strings are the nonterminal labels from the grammar, the positions are encoded as a bitmask. There can be multiple positions when a constituent is discontinuous. So this edge could be represent an analysis of is Mary happy, where is and happy both belong to the VP. The chart dictionary is indexed by the first element of this edge, S, 111 in this case. In a new version I tried transposing this representation in the hope that it would save memory due to reusep  precodeS, NP, VP, 111, 100, 011 codepre  pI figured that Python would store the first part only once if it would occur in combination  with different positions, although Im not actually sure this is true. In either case, it didnt seem to make any difference.p  pSo basically what I am wondering is if it is worth pursuing my Python implementation any further, including doing things with Cython and different datastructures, or that writing it from the ground up in C is the only viable option.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong After some improvements I no longer have issues with memory usage.

Negative 12658 pI wrote a program that draws a specific situation of a board gameI think its called Ludo in English. Now I can draw all the fields and the pawns etc., but if a pawn is moved I have to redraw that pawn. The problem is that the screen flashes for a very short time when I do this. This is probably because I first clear all fields and pawns, and then redraw themIm going to improve this, but the problem will, in smaller form, still occur I think, the screen is then flashing between the time I cleared everything until I redrawed everything. Is there a way to tell C not to redraw even when I specifically call something like codethis.Controls.Clearcode until I tell it top  pI already tried it with codethis.SuspendLayoutcode, because the name suggests it should do exactly this, but that doesnt work.p

Negative 12658 pI currently have code in my controller which retrieves 3 types of entities from a db, in order to populate 3 select field.  The controller also takes responsibility for invoking the form objects validate method, and upon success, it instantiates and sets an entitys properties from the form inputs and calls on a data mapper to persist it.

Negative 12658 pOk, ive this multi view IPhone application in which ive integrated adWhirl ads. Thats the good news. The bad news is that ive literally implemented the adWhirl ads in each view controller, which means every time a view is pushed a new adWhirl object is created which takes time to load the AdMobiAds advertisements. Now, I cant help thinking about this being the wrong way to go about the problem. So the question is, do I make a singleton ad object maybe in the appDelegates didFinishLaunching method and use that ad object in all the view controllers or what Ive done is pretty much how it should be donep

Negative 12658 pI have a web app with a presentation layer and a business layer as individual projects. One being a web application and the other being a class library. I have added a web reference to the web application to use a webservice. I am having no trouble using the service API but Im finding myself adding a lot of business layer type logic in my presentation layer to utilize this API. I would love it if I could just change some of my business layer code to work with the web service, but the configuration of such sounds like a big circular no no. Anyway I would love to have my objects be able to keep doing what theyre doing but have it also work with a webservice, but i find myself having to create a helpermanager class in my presentation layer to work with the webservice. This causes me to require code changes everywhere I was performing the actions on the objects that I wanted to add to with the service. What is the correct way of attacking this issuep  pIm not even sure there is a legitimate question anywhere in all that rambling but if anyone could offer any helpful words i would be greatly appreciative.p  pThanks p

Negative 12658 pFollowing on from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6597847optimizationofagclanguageanyideasmy last questiona on optimization Im finding it easier to believe that its simply not possible to optimize my code further to get better performance in my game.p  pSo now I have a new idea and would like to know if its possible or even worthwhile to implement. Since the clear bottleneck in performance is from the physics processing which is based in .net, I was thinking, would it be possible to fit in an objectivec or C based physics engine such as box2D to interact with Monop  pFor example in the Mono code I would do something like CreateBox but behind the scenes the box is created in ObjCC. Or when I do a physics update, I simply call the function in Mono and the brunt work happens in ObjCCp  pIf this is possible can anyone point me in the right direction to get started p

Negative 12658 pI have written a small script to synchronize two directories. The script allows to sync certain file types and allows file comparison by checksum or date. After comparison a list of files that should be copied is given to a file copy procedure that makes use of the strongshutil.copy2strong module. In various test runs I found a strange behaviour of shutil.copy2 and I do not have a workaroundp  pFirst If the source is an ext3 volume and the target is fat32 memory stick shutil raises an error. I think it is because shutil.copy2 tries to copy the metadata as well and this is not supported by fat32. But I do not know how to catch this error with a try except statement.p  pSecond The second Problem is even more difficult. Both source and target are ext3 volumes. On the source there are some backups of a complete Linux directory tree. When my utility tries to synchronize these directory trees, the script runs in an endless loop until my system partition runs out of space. I tried to fix this behaviour and use the stat module to check if the source file is a regular file before starting the copy process but it does not help. The file in question with the strange behaviour is proc661fd3. Maybe there are some more, but I cannot test that because my system freezes because of the memory consumption while trying to copy this file.p  pI tried to find a solution for these two problems for several day now and I hope that the skilled programmers around her can support me.p  pThanks for any help.p  pHere the code of my filecopy procedurep  precodedef filecopyfilelist, fromdir, todir, overwrt print Files and directories will be processed  for filetupel in filelist     sourcefilename  fromdir  filetupel[1]  filetupel[0]     try         filemode  os.statsourcefilename.stmode     except         filemode  33205      if SISREGfilemode         targetdirname  todir  filetupel[1]         if not os.path.isdirtargetdirname             print Create directory   targetdirname             mkdirtargetdirname         targetfilename  targetdirname  filetupel[0]         if os.path.isfiletargetfilename and overwrt  mark             nameappendix  markedbysyncasdifferenton  time.strftimeadbYHMS, time.localtime             if targetfilename.find.  1                 newtargetfilename  targetfilename  nameappendix                 newsourcefilename  sourcefilename  nameappendix             else                 newtargetfileprefix  targetfilename.rpartition.[0]                 newtargetfileextension  targetfilename.rpartition.[2]                 newtargetfilename  newtargetfileprefix  nameappendix  .  newtargetfileextension                 newsourcefileprefix  sourcefilename.rpartition.[0]                 newsourcefilename  newsourcefileprefix  nameappendix  .  newtargetfileextension             print Rename file   targetfilename   in   newtargetfilename             os.renametargetfilename, newtargetfilename             print Copy file   newtargetfilename   to   newsourcefilename             try                 shutil.copy2newtargetfilename, newsourcefilename             except                 print Could not copy   newtargetfilename   to   newsourcefilename         print Copy file   sourcefilename   to   targetfilename         try             shutil.copy2sourcefilename, targetfilename         except             print Could not copy   sourcefilename   to   targetfilename     else         print sourcefilename   seems to be no regular file and will not be copied. codepre  pAfter following the hint from Answer No. 1 the shutil,copy2 statements changes top  precode    shutil.copyfilesourcefilename, targetfilename     try         try to set permission bits         shutil.copymodenewtargetfilename, newsourcefilename     except         print Permission bits could not be copied     try         try to copy metadata         shutil.copystatnewtargetfilename, newsourcefilename     except         print Metadata could not be copied   codepre

Negative 12658 pPython newbie here.  Im writing a script that can dump some output to either a file or stdout, depending on the arguments passed to it.  When interpreting arguments, I assign either an codeopencodeed file or codestdoutcode to a global variable named codeoutputfilecode, which can be used by the rest of the script to write output regardless of what type of stream was selected.  At the very end of the script I codeclosecode codeoutputfilecode.  This is proper to do for a file stream, and though its redundant for stdout, my experience with other programming languages suggests that theres no emharmem in explicitly closing stdout immediately before the program ends.p  pHowever, whenever stdout is used for output and subsequently closed, I get a ValueError IO operation on closed file..  I know this error is not directly produced by my call to close stdout, but occurs after my script returns.  My question is  Why does this happen, and is there a way to manually close stdout without triggering it  Im aware that I can easily work around the problem by conditionally closing the stream only when a file was selected, but I want to know ifwhy this is necessary.p  pVery simple demonstrative snippetp  precodefrom sys import stdout stdout.close codepre

Negative 12658 pstrongHi All,strong p  pI have an application windows serviceC which starts strongEXCELstrong and strongPOWERPOINTstrong and copies the data between these two applications using system strongclipboardstrong.br Application runs on a server with multiple active terminal sessions.br Office apps by default start in a session with lowest session ID.p  pstrongCOM objectsstrongp  pI use COM objects to communicate between msservice and office apps. Following code is an example of how I run strongEXCELstrong.p  precodexlApp  new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application   xlWorkBook  xlApp.Workbooks.Openpathtomyfile, 0, false, 5, , , false, Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.XlPlatform.xlWindows, , true, false, 0, true, false, false codepre  pstrongMulti Threadingstrong  parallel sessionsp  pATM the application is running on single thread mode. Im planning to run 2 simultaneous threards... the problem is that I have only 1 clipboard available for communication purposes. In order to get another one, Im planning to run the whole application on 2 separate windows sessions. In that case I would have 2 separate singlethreaded solutions. There will be 2 copies of the service, running their own office apps and Ill have 2 separate clipboards for my use. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pOne matter remains unsolved  I have no idea how to force these office apps to run on different user sessions. From what I see, they  are always running in a sesison with lowest ID. p  pIve found similar question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1280855onterminalserverhowdoesaservicestartaprocessinauserssessionOn Terminal Server, how does a service start a process in a user39s sessiona , however, running a process is not that similar to running office application via COM objects.p  pstrongEDIT strong Ive noticed that if I open the EXCEL not from WINDOWS SERVICE but from WINDOWS FROMS APPLICATION, the EXCEL behaves differently. It no longer starts under user session with lowest ID, instead it opens itself on the same account where WINDOWS FORMS APP is running.

Negative 12658 pI have a Python script with a handful of threads linked together by queues. One of the threads has a MySQLdb connection that is used in the init function of the thread, and in the main loop in the threads main loop as well.p  pNow when the script runs, the MySQLdb connection works just fine in the init part of the thread. But when it is used in the threads main loop, it deadlocks completely on the codeself.cursor.executeSQLcode line. Now things get even weirder when I hit CtrlC after the deadlock. The deadlock is then broken and the MySQLdb cursor gets its result and the thread continues just fine until the KeyboardInterupt is caught.p  pI have used the same code before many times, but this is the first time I have used MySQLdb in  it. I have never ever come across this behavior before, and I am at a loss trying to understand what is going on here. Its one thing if I would have some exception to refer to, but there is none. Also, I dont really understand why the codeself.cursor.executeSQLcode line actually returns the correct value after I hit CtrlC.p  pI am not at liberty to show the actual code, but believe me, it is completely straight forward without any frills. The threads main loop is just a while loop with a Queue get function with a MySQLdb query straight after. It doesnt seem to be a SQL issue as I have tried with the simplest codeSELECT hellocode query and it still leads to the same behavior.p  pWhat could be the reason for this behaviorp  pFWIW, I am using Python 2.7 and I get the same behavior on OS X  Ubuntu 11.10.p  pstrongEDITstrong I am starting to wonder whether its something caused by the MySQL server setup. I just tried using another Python MySQL library pymysql, and it gives the same behavior.p  pstrongEDIT2strong I just restarted the MySQL server with the slow log queries thing. Strangely enough I can see the other queries but the query that blocks doesnt show up.p  pstrongEDIT3 [solved sort of]strong I found a hrefhttpcode.activestate.comrecipes577334howtodebugdeadlockedmultithreadedprograms relnofollowthisa recipe detailing how to see what the threads are up to. After a bit of debugging it became obvious that the culprit was imports within the MySQLdb module. I then simply commented out rows 8395 in MySQLdbcursors.py and it suddenly worked ok. I dont think those lines are that important anyway as they only seem to render some warnings and I am sure of the quality of these particular queries I am running.p  pIf someone actually knows a more robust way around the issue Id love to hear it though.p

The error that I am receiving is Argument 1 cannot convert from System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection to System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collectionp  pSome background for the design decisions that led to this issue I have created a web service for dealing with IFruit, but due to the nature of SOAP and endpoint bindings as I understand them I have created methods with explicit implementations of IFruit. On the business layer, creating a separate method for each specific implementation of fruit would firstly cause a lot of duplicate code, and secondly couple the business and service layer tightly enough that accepting new IFruit types in the web service later would also require changing my code in the business layer adding another copy of redundant code. This design is one I have successfully implemented using Java in the past, but C interfaces seem to be just different enough to throw me.

There is a picture, a text area and a button, and I want that button to close the new stage that is the aboutBox from within the AboutBox.java class so to speak. p  pThe only way I found myself to be able to do this, was to define a  public static Stage aboutBox inside the Builder.java class and reference to that one from within the AboutBox.java in method that handles the action event on the closing button. But somehow it doesnt feel exactly clean and right. Is there any better wayp  pThanks in advance for your advices.p
Negative 12658 pI have a MySQL database and a table with about 128,000 rows pretty tiny from what I understand.  I also have an application connected to it that is set up to do paging.  My SQL queries look something like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM Documents WHERE PortfolioId   LIMIT , SELECT  FROM Documents WHERE PortfolioId   ORDER BY Date DESC LIMIT , codepre  pMy problem is twofold.  First, regardless of which query is used, the higher the first LIMIT number, the slower the query returns, eventually moving into an unacceptable delay.  For instance, if I go to phpmyadmin and executep  precodeSELECT  FROM Documents WHERE PortfolioId  1 LIMIT 0,20 codepre  pThe query takes .001 seconds.  However, when I execute thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM Documents WHERE PortfolioId  1 LIMIT 120000,20 codepre  pThe query takes 14.8 seconds.p  pMy second problem is that the second query where I order by Date which is also indexed in the table, makes the respective queries take much, much longer .1 seconds for the first example,  em2 minutes and 23 secondsem for the second example.p  pIs there a better way to execute these queries so they are much faster From my understanding, developers often implement paging on tables that have millions of rows but, doing it this way, it would take an extremely long time for the later pages to load.p

Negative 12658 pI stumbled onto something with Groovy closures and delegates that Im not sure is an official part of the language or perhaps even a bug.p  pBasically i am defining a closure that I read in as a string from an external source,  and one of the variables in the class that defines the closure needs to be modified by the closure.   I wrote  a simple example showing what I found works, and what does not work.p  pIf you look at the test code below you will see a class that defines a variablep  precodeanimal  cat codepre  pand two closures defined on the fly from strings that attempt to modify the animal variable.  p  pThis works p  precode    String code   gt   delegate.animal  bear   return name  xx   codepre  pBut this does notp  precode    String code   gt   animal  bear   return name  xx   codepre  pIt seems like i need to explicitly qualify my tobemodified variable with delegate. for this to work.

Negative 12658 pI need to move math league data between two different systems, both written in Java.

I would choose XML serialization because Im the most familiar with that. But Im curious about the advantages of JSON or YAML. At the same time, I need to add some export feature to the web application that will let me move some data into a format that the desktop client can read.

Negative 12658 pI have a selenium script Ive written in java that automates the input of some text into a text box for submission into a database. It was working fine until for some reason it broke one day, giving the error that the text box I was trying to write to was not visible. Several days later Ive finality figured out that someone much higher up must have updated the text box to be using a hrefhttpcodemirror.net1contribxqueryindex.html relnofollowcode mirrora which makes the text box invisible and creates some kind of javascript substitute thing. p  pIve been searching all day, and the only solutions I can find are disabling javascript within the selenium environment, causing the whole thing to default back to a normal text box, or somehow writing to the code mirror object with selenium. I havent been able to find a way to do either, so would anybody here know a possible solution to my problemp  pCheersp

Negative 12658 pAn item that I am struggling with is when I attempt to take a screen capture of any portion of the GMSMapView Google Maps SDK iOS. The UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext UIImage output is invisible. I eventually discovered that the GMSMapView is rendered with OpenGL. Knowing this, I attempted to use the glReadPixels method. The troubling thing is that I am able to retrieve a map screen capture on the iPhone simulator just fine, but when I use the same method on a real device it is still invisible iOS 6. p  pIm wondering if anyone has run into the same issue Ive done my share of investigating. I could not find anything relevant to my situation. Most of the generic solutions I did find said that I should update a few of the CAEAGLLayer attributes. I assumed the GMSMapView would limit me from finding the appropriate layer, but I was able to find and update the CAEAGLLayer, as seen belowp  precode[CAEAGLLayer [[[mapView subviews] objectAtIndex0] layer] setOpaque NO]  [CAEAGLLayer [[[mapView subviews] objectAtIndex0] layer] setDrawableProperties[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES],kEAGLDrawablePropertyRetainedBacking,kEAGLColorFormatRGBA8, kEAGLDrawablePropertyColorFormat,nil]] codepre  pForums recommended that by setting the layers OPAQUE attribute to NO and the retained backing property to YES it would alleviate the iOS 6 issue. It did fix it on the simulator, but not the device. p  pThe last fix I stumbled across said to update the main OpenGL views preserveBackBuffer to YES. This is where my technical expertise ended. I have not been able to find where or how to update the GMSMapViews preserveBackBuffer value. Im assuming this is the fix that will remedy all of my screen capture issues. Seems to be solely an issue with devices running iOS 6. p  pDoes anyone have a tested workaround for this issuep

Negative 12658 pI think this user was asking the same question Im asking, but the reason driving his question was different, so he accepted a different solution.  I need to do what he was originally askingp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13571433automaticallycancellingjqgridrequestAutomatically cancelling jqgrid requestap  pMy jqGrid has a search toolbar the input fields that appear below the column headers but above the data.  Most of the columns have dropdowns stypeselect that list the available filter options for that column, with an All option at the top.  The serverside code that responds with the JSON data that populates my jqGrid is complex and therefore somewhat slow, especially when there isnt much in the way of filter criteria.  This means that if the user selects All, it may be several seconds before any results show up.  This is fine by itself, but if the user makes another filter selection before the response comes back, the grid does not cancel the existing request, nor does it submit a new one, so at some point emafterem the user makes the second selection, the grid updates to show the response for the emfirstem selection.  Furthermore, the grid autoupdates when you emchangeem the filter selection, so to get it to show the data you wanted, you have to change your selection to something else, wait for that to load, and then change it back.p  pHeres what Ive tried so farp  precodedocument.readysetupGrid  var currentGridRequest  function setupGrid      var grid  grid.jqGrid         ...         loadError functionxhr, status, error              currentGridRequest  undefined         ,         loadComplete functiondata              currentGridRequest  undefined         ,         loadBeforeSend functionxhr, settings              if currentGridRequest  undefined                  currentGridRequest.abort                          currentGridRequest  xhr                codepre  pThe problem I have is that the loadBeforeSend event doesnt actually fire if theres already a request in flight.  Ive tried a other events from the event documentation page a hrefhttpwww.trirand.comjqgridwikidoku.phpidwikievents relnofollowhttpwww.trirand.comjqgridwikidoku.phpidwikieventsa beforeRequest and jqGridToolbarBeforeSearch both exhibit the same behavior.  p  pWhat can I do to abort the inflight request and proceed with searching based on the users most recent selection  Is this a bug in jqGrid  I initially encountered this issue on version 4.2 Ive just upgraded to 4.4.4 with no change in this behavior.p  pLooking at the jqGrid code, the behavior Im seeing appears to be unavoidable without changing the jqGrid code itself.  jqGrid sets a flag ts.grid.hDiv.loading at the beginning of each request and clears it at the end when this flag is set, new filter criteria will not be submitted and no events will fire.p  pI also considered modifying my JSON response so that it included the request criteria, and then write some JS code to compare the response to the current criteria selection.  If they didnt match, Id ignore the response and not render it to the grid.  Since jqGrid doesnt even SUBMIT the second set of criteria, that option is off the table and even if I can fix that problem, my current approach seems preferable.p
Negative 12658 pI am trying to upload large files video files to Facebook, but regardless of the approach taken, the result is always the same.

Negative 12658 pSo a little trivia first..p  pThere is written in ASP.NET website, which uses NTLM protocol to authenticate users that want to log in. Its perfectly ok when they normally use it, they type in website URL, they provide their credentials, authenticate and maintain session in web browser.p  pWhat I want to do, is create PHP website that will act as bot. It is my companys internal website and I am approved to do so. The problem I run into, is managing session. Users will be able to type in their credentials in my PHP website, and my PHP website will authenticate them to target site, using cURL. p  pThe code I got so far isp  precode    cookiefilepath  dirnameFILE . cookies.txt     ch  curlinit            curlsetoptch, CURLOPTUSERPWD, username.  . password      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER, 0      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTUSERAGENT, useragent      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, url      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYHOST, 0      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHTTPAUTH, CURLAUTHANY      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCOOKIEFILE, cookiefilepath      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCOOKIEJAR, cookiefilepath      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATION, true      curlsetoptch, CURLINFOHEADEROUT, true      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTFAILONERROR, 0      curlsetoptch, CURLOPTMAXREDIRS, 100          ret  curlexecch codepre  pAbove code logs in to target website by cURL which manages NTLM handshake, as it seems, and fetches websites content. It also stores Session ID that is sent back in cookie file. p  pWhat Im trying to do next, is comment the codeCURLOPTUSERPWDcode option, in hope that this script will use session ID stored in cookie file to authenticate previously logged in user in second execution of this script. It could get rid of user credentials and do not store it anywhere that way, becouse it is not safe to store it in manually created session, database, or anywhere else.p  pI need this becouse bot will be using CRON to periodically check if website status has changed and perform some user actions as reaction to this. But to do this, user first must be authenticated, and his username and password must not be stored anywhere, so I have to use session information estabilished when he initially logged in.p  pCURL seems to NOT DO THIS. When I execute script second time with commented codeCURLOPTUSERPWDcode option, it does not use stored cookie to keep beeing authenticated. Instead, it strongREWRITESstrong cookie file with not relevant data send to me from service as response to strongNOT AUTHRORISEDstrong access request. p  pMy questions are  Why cURL doesnt use stored session information to keep beeing authenticated Is there any way to maintain this session with cURL and NTLM protocol based websitep  pThanks in advance.p

Is it possible to create a factory in AngularJS whose key cannot be overwritten For example, I can set up a constant like this, which cannot be overwrittenp  blockquote   pmodule.constantanimals, cat meow, dog woofp blockquote  pBut Id like to do something like this that allows for overwritten emvaluesem but not the factory itselfp  precodemodule.valuecatSound,meow       .valuedogSound,woof       .factoryanimals, [catSound,dogSound, functioncatSound, dogSound              return                   cat catSound,                  dog dogSound                     codepre  pThe above factory can be overwritten allowing for another piece of code to have codemodule.factoryanimals,function return 7 code and break everything. However, as a factory, the individual values emcanem and should be overwritable, so I should be able to assign codemodule.valuecatSound,hisscode and have things still work as expected.p  pIve tried injecting into constants, but as far as Ive been able to understand that isnt possible. How can I prevent my factory declaration from being overwritten I realize that emconstantem probably isnt the correct term when describing what I want, but I do want the factorys function emdefinitionem to be constant.p

Negative 12658 pLets say I have two classes with the same name Bar in different modules the global namespace  no namespace and Foo in a Rails application. Both classes live in appmodelsbar.rb or in appmodelsfoobar.rb respectively and are thereby autoloaded by rails.p  precode appmodelsfoobar.rb module Foo   class Bar     def self.somemethod     end   end end   appmodelsbar.rb class Bar end codepre  pI have another class in the Foo namespace that uses the Bar class in a class method.p  precodemodule Foo   class Qux     class ltlt self       def something         Bar.somemethod  This raises a NoMethod error because                          it uses the Bar defined in the global namespace                          and not the one in Foo       end     end   end end codepre  pRails autoloading tries to load Bar using the current classes codenamecode, which is codenilcode in the singleton class, and defaults to Object.p  precodeklassname  name.presence  Object   from activesupportdependencies.rb codepre  pThis causes Rails to load codeBarcode from appmodelsbar.rb instead of appmodelsfoobar.rb. If I define codeQux.somethingcode with codedef self.somethingcode then code.namecode is FooQux instead of nil and the autoloading works correctly.p  pI see 3 options for at the moment to work around this problemp  p1 Rename one of the codeBarcode classesbr 2 use the codeself.code syntax everywherebr 3 Namespace codeBarcode with codeFooBarcode explicitly everywhere  p  pI dont like any of these options becausep  p1 codeBarcode is just the name that fits the bestbr 2 codeclass ltlt selfcode is perfectly fine by itself and used by most ruby developers, so the chance is high that the next poor guy stumbles over the same issues again soonbr 3 Same as 2, it doesnt really fix the underlying Problem and somebody will waste some time in the future to figure out why his code doesnt work as expected.  p  pIs there another, better option you can think ofp

Negative 12658 pI am investigating a problem with our website that uses SQL server to manage sessions.  The website is asp.net webforms based around the sitecore CMS.  We have the same code in various environments e.g. QA, staging, and production.  p  pIn production, what we are seeing is, periodically, we get a rapidly rising CPU usage that does not correlate in any way to traffic to the server.  Along with this cpu spike, we are seeing a corresponding spike in network IO.  p  pOur monitoring software does not differentiate between traffic out to the internet and traffic to the DB server however, what we are seeing on the DB server is strongliterally hundreds of calls per second to codedbo.TempGetStateItemExclusive3codestrong in the asp session database, all for the same session id, and no corresponding amount of page requests coming into the web servers.p  pWith the same code and config, we simply do not see this behaviour for other environments.

Negative 12658 pA Database already has up to 2530 tables and all are strongMyISAMstrong. Most of these tables are related to each other meaning a lot of queries use joins on IDs and retrieve data.p  pOne of the tables contain strong710 Millionstrong records and it becomes slow if i want to perform a search or update or even retrieval of all data. Now i proposed a solution to my boss saying that converting tables into InnoDB might give better performance.p  pI also explained the benefits of InnoDBp  ol lipSince we anyways join multiple tables on keys and they are related, it will be better to use foreign keys and have relational database which will avoid strongOrphan Rowsstrong. I found around strong1015kstrong orphan rows in one of the big tables and had to manually remove them. pli lipSupport for transactions, we perform big updates from time to time and if one of them fails on the way we have to replace the entire table with the backedup one and run the update again to make sure that all queries were executed. With InnoDB we can revert back any changes from query 1 if query 2 fails.pli ol  pNow the response i got from my boss is that I need to prove that InnoDB will run faster than MyISAM. My question is, wont above 2 things improve the speed of the application itself by eliminating orphan rowsp  pIn general is MyISAM faster than InnoDB p  pstrongNote using MySQL 5.5strongp

Negative 12658 pMy web application will be triggered from an external system. It will call one request path of my app, but uses different query parameters for different kinds of requests.p  pOne of the parameters is the action that defines what is to be done. The rest of the params depend on the action.p  pSo I can get request params like thesep  precodeactionsayHelloampuserJoe actionnewUserampnameJoeampaddressxxx actionresetPassword ... codepre  pI would like to be able to encode it similarly in the routes file for play so it does the query param based routing and as much of the validation of other parameters as possible.p  pWhat I have instead is one routing for all of these possibilities with plenty of optional parameters. The action processing it starts with a big pattern match to do dispatch and parameter validation.p  pGoogling and checking SO just popped up plenty of samples where the params are encoded in the request path somehow, so multiple paths are routed to the same action, but I would like the opposite one path routed to different actions.p  pOne of my colleagues said we could have one dispatcher action that would just redirect based on the action parameter. It would be a bit more structured then the current solution, but it would not eliminate the long list of optional parameters which should be selectively passed to the next action, so I hope one knows an even better solution p  pBTW the external system that calls my app is developed by another company and I have no influence on this design, so its not an option to change the way how my app is triggered.p

Negative 12658 pI was trying to prove a point with OpenMP compared to MPICH, and I cooked up the following example to demonstrate how easy it was to do some high performance in OpenMP.p  pThe GaussSeidel iteration is split into two separate runs, such that in each sweep every operation can be performed in any order, and there should be no dependency between each task. So in theory each processor should never have to wait for another process to perform any kind of synchronization. p  pThe problem I am encountering, is that I, independent of problem size, find there is only a weak speedup of 2 processors and with more than 2 processors it might even be slower.

So errors that happen after running the batch could not trigger an abort.pli lipThe codetransactional endpointcode in combination with codeautoindexingcode and codelabelsschemacode  gives me 1,2,4,5 nodes only and 6, but not 3, because labelsschema only works on nodes.

All 3 are being rendered with their likenamed components, which are being derived from a base page component.p  pIn this page component, I have a body.jsp that is including my navpanel component.  Everything works fine, but when setting the images in the navpanel while on the home page, they do not show on the other two.p  pI know the reason for this is because the navpanel design path is codeetcdesignstestsitejcrcontenthomepagenavpanelcodep  pIn codebody.jspcode, when including navpanel, I tried setting the path variable in the cqinclude to an absolute path ie codeetcdesignstestsitejcrcontentnavpanelcode, since according to the API, it should take an absolute path and not modify it at all.  Instead, when outputting codecurrentStyle.getPathcode, it continues to show the first path which includes homepage.p  pTo achieve my goal, I need to be able to configure the design path for this component to be on a global level and not nested within the templates design.p  pIs there a programmatic way of changing this value  Does it sound like there is a bug with the codecqinclude pathcode not behaving as intendedp
Negative 12658 pI need an advice for choosing sheet while reading through loads of Excelspreadsheets. The firm Im working for already has a big database of 100 Excelspreadsheets, where I am searching for values in a specific sheet. The problem is that the name and index of the spreadsheet variates, especially when it comes to the old documents. Ive tried both codesheetbyidex6code and codesheetbynamenamecode, but I cant seem to get it right. p  pWhen searching for codesheetbyindex6code, the problem is that the index changes in some documents, from for example index 5 to index 6. Another problem is that they also have hidden sheets, which Im not sure if will interrupt or just become the last indexes. p  pWhen searching for codesheetbynamenamecode, the problem is that the sheet name in most cases is called Ship Res.

Negative 12658 pIm having a rather simple issue with Macro. In it, I assign a formula to a cell. I would like it not to calculate it at first and do calculation only after some other part of Macro is finished. I thought I would do something like thisp  precodeApplication.Calculation  xlCalculationManual CellsStartRow, 4  i.Formula  FORMULA ... Application.Calculation  xlCalculationAutomatic codepre  pBut that doesnt work. It stops automatic calculations, but not for that cell  it still performs the calculation right after I assign the formula. Is there a way to skip itp  pTo clarify the exact prupose of this in my actual code Im assigning a formula to a group of cells in a cycle. Everytime I assign it to one cell  it calculates it. I figured if I will first assign them all and then do the calculation  it would be faster. As a matter of fact strongit isstrong. So instead of assigning it in a cycle, I assign it to the first cell and then do autofill. Autofilled formulas wait until I enable automatic calculation and I get a much faster macro. However, the initial assignemnt is still calculated which makes macro almost twice as slow.p

Negative 12658 pIve used Vim to code my Go script for a month, and Im pretty comfortable with codeImportcode and codeDropcode vim command when it comes to importing and unimporting any packages.p  pHowever, Ive more and more tired of typing such a long word which includes Capital letter so frequently, so I came to think that if I can use codeicode and codedcode other than codeImportcode and codeDropcode, Id be satisfied even more. However, Im not sure whether I can define such a command in Vim, since it involves 1 turning into commandline mode, and 2 taking a variable which is determined dynamically in typing.p  pSo for example, if I import codeencodingcsvcode package, all I want to type in is codei encodingcsvcode, etc... Can I define those commandsp  pI stumbled upon a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3878692aliasingacommandinvimthis questiona, but I cannot get what it is doing nor Im not sure whether the answer applies to this question in the first place. Can I solve the issue by replacing all of codewcode and codeWcode on the linked post to codeicode or codedcodep  pAlso, does it differ from the case that doesnt take a variable say, codeFmtcode command to goformat the scriptp  pThanks.p

So if anyone could help or perhaps point out something which could be causing this would be appreciatedp  precodepublic class TimerTest       static int attempts  4     static Timer timer  new Timer     static int controler     static int seconds  1     static Scanner keyboard  new ScannerSystem.in     static int time1, time2, time3      public static void run           Timer timer  new Timer         timer.scheduleAtFixedRatenew TimerTask               public void run                  if controler  1                      System.out.printlnseconds   seconds                                closed the running of timer          , 0, 1000          closed timer            public static void mainString args[]           System.out.printlntttthe rulesn         System.out.println1 press 1 then enter to start the game         System.out.println2 press 2 then enter as soon as you can to stop the timer         System.out.println3only enter the specified numbers none other         System.out.println4 numbers only no lettersnn          do               System.out.printlntttplease push 1 to start             controler  keyboard.nextInt              if controler  1 ampamp attempts  0                   run                 attempts               else if controler  2 ampamp attempts  3                   System.out.printlnstopped                  controler  controler  1                 System.out.printlnyour time is   seconds                 time1  seconds                 seconds  0               else if controler  2 ampamp attempts  2                   System.out.printlnstopped                  controler  controler  1                 System.out.printlngo 2   seconds                 time2  seconds                 seconds  0               else if controler  2 ampamp attempts  1                   System.out.printlnstopped                  controler  controler  1                 time3  seconds                 System.out.printlnfinal go   seconds                 seconds  0                 attempts  0                            System.out.printlnnyou have   attempts   attempts remainingn           while attempts  0          if time1 gt time2 ampamp time1 gt time3              System.out.printlnyour first go was slowest with a time of   time1   seconds          else if time2 gt time1 ampamp time2 gt time3              System.out.printlnyour second go was slowest with a time of   time2   seconds          else if time3 gt time1 ampamp time3 gt time2              System.out.printlnyour final go was slowest with a time of   time3   seconds          else              System.out.printlnSTOP FUCKING UP MY PROGRAM JAVA                   if attempts  0              System.out.printlnngame over, thanks for playing and please try again             System.exit0                  codepre

Negative 12658 pI am typically using R to do statistical analysis, and rather new to the data visualization capabilities. Im trying to figure out if there is some way to marry the motion chart package codegvisMotionChartcode with the mapping package, codegvisGeoMapcode. Id like to display a video of events over time, appearing on a map on their date of occurrence at latlon coordinates and then fading out. Anyone know if its possible to do this Any additional concerns if I have over 50,000 records daily over 5 years that I want to feed in to be displayedp  pPlease note that I do not have to use the codegviscode packagesI am just using these to motivate the idea. If there are other dynamic mapping packages available in R that will just draw on a shapefile and my event records, all the better.p  pThanksp

Negative 12658 pIve been working on the web for quite a long time and I saw the best practices evolve. Im now fairly convinced separating HTML Content, Javascript Behavior and CSS UI is the best thing to do.p  pA few months ago, I started using knockout.js . I did choose it among other similar frameworks like backbone or angular because a chapter in an MVC training I followed was about knockout, and the concept seduced me. Then after a quick comparison on the web it didnt look as a bad choice for my needs, and for a start.p  pBut heres my problem  when I look at my HTML code now, after a few weeks of dev on a project, theres quite a lot of knockout bindings in it, and it makes me think a lot about the old times, when we or at least I used to put inline javascript event handling through codeonclickcode attribute and so on.p  pTherefore those 2 questions, which Im not sure are 100 suited for SO, but I cant find any better StackExchange site to ask it p  ol lipIs using knockout or the other frameworks as they all seem to basically work with the same pattern contrary to the separation rule  Or is it an acceptable smallstepout of this rule  or is it even perfectly acceptable because it uses the data attributes pli lipIn the case this would be a somehow bad practice, is there any possibility to do all the binding through a separate javascript file, using for example jQuery to select the controls and apply bindings to them  If not possible in knockout, is it with another framework  I must admit at the time I did my selection, I diddnt think about this kind of implications...pli ol  pThank you and sorry if this should be moved to another SE site.p
Negative 12658 pIm trying to commit some changes to a SVN repository, but the commit results in an E210002 error. I am using plain SVN and not SVNSSH as discussed in the other questions I found dealing with this error, thus the solutions for SVNSSH dont work for me. The repository server is up and on a reliable connection, so it is not a network problem. What else could be causing this Errorp
Negative 12658 pI found out a common way to store data is Androids strongSharedPreferencesstrong. So I went out and tried to implement it with my application.p  pWhat I want to dop  ul liMy application retrieves strongweather detailsstrong from the users current stronglocationstrong, if the user desires heshe can add the location by pressing add to strongfavoritesstrong. They can have up to 10 favorite locations. So I want to store the location description exp Dayton, OH, the stronglatitude and longitudestrong So I may fetch the details when they want to see that weather. So Shared Preferences seem to fit my need. li ul  pWhat I did  I created a loop that would cycle through 10 keys for 10 locations an as long as the keys were null the location information would be saved. If the key was not null, it means the key has already been created.p  pMy codep  precodepublic void writeNewLocationString stringLat, String stringLon, String location       this.latitude  stringLat     this.longitude  stringLon     this.location  location      pref  mContext.getSharedPreferencesfavoritelocations, 0  0  for private mode     Editor editor  pref.edit      Loop through all the favorite keys to find an open spot     forint i  1 i lt 10 i           Test for current favorite key         String value  pref.getStringfavorite i location,null          if value  null              The key does not exist so it can be created and written to             First write the location description             editor.putStringfavorite  i  location, location             Next the write the latitude and lonitude values             editor.putStringfavorite  i  latitude, latitude             editor.putStringfavorite  i  longitude, longitude             editor.commit             i  11          else              If at end of loop Inform user             ifi  10                  Display an error                 Instantiate an AlertDialog.Builder with its constructor                 AlertDialog.Builder builder  new AlertDialog.BuildermContext                  Create the AlertDialog characteristics                 builder.setMessageYou can only have up to 10 favorite locations.

Negative 12658 pI am creating an app and a website for a project Ive got going, but Im not sure what I should do about login. This is not a emIm a noob and I want an app with loginemquestion. I am somewhat experienced with both web, database and appdevelopment, but Ive never actually touched the subject of emsecurityem before other than by application templates.p  pWhat Im imagining is a simple loginsystem like Skype, Facebook, NetFlix, really any app that you are able to log in to, which also has a website to log in to.p  pA part of my question is towards the security of the process. My initial thought is that a password in clean text should never be sent over internet, which makes me believe that the passwords should be hashedencrypted on the phone, as well on the website, when logging in. Ive done some smalltime hashingencrypting before, but just by using codesha1code and codemd5code to convert the text. Whats the proper way to do this With my current knowledge, I assume that if Im using codemd5code to encrypt a password, anyone could decrypt it with codemd5code too, but that I could use a codeSALTcode or some form for altering key. Is that how the big boys are doing it, or is there a secret passage I dont know ofp  pNow onto the real strongquestionstrong.. How should I store a login securelyp  pWhat Ive tried When making a testproject in Xcode for this, I simply created a class codeUsercode with a field for codeusernamecode. When logging in by entering a username and password, I simply sent a codePOSTcodemethod codeHTTPrequestcode to my code.phpcodepage, which simply performed a codeSELECT  FROM User WHERE Username  POST[username] AND Password  POST[password]code If the database returned one row, then the password was correct, and the page could print out the user in JSON or whatever. When the device got the successful login, I converted the userobject in the app, now containing the username and potentially UserID, Email, Address etc. to codeNSDatacode, and using codeNSKeyedArchivercode and codeNSKeyedUnarchivercode to save and load the user, never to authenticate again. If the user clicks Log out, I wipe this archive. This works, but I sense that its not a particularly emsecureem way of doing it. If so, why exactly is thatp  pOur backend is currently Googles App Enginejava, which has support for OAuth. Some are recommending this, but we cant find any proper documentation that makes sense for our plan with custom usersp

Negative 12658 pI have read about this topic in CLR C but theres something im wondering about.p  pIt is said that an instance of a class only stores its fields, a type object pointer pointing to its type object and its sync block index in the heap. the type object itself also has a type object pointer. so at which object does the type objects type object pointer point to shouldnt be all important data and metadata for the class already be in the type object itselfp  phope you get my point its quite confusing p

Negative 12658 pThe c code below is by no means ideal and Im really just looking for advice and suggestions as to how I could best refactor this and make the code safer.p  pBasically there is a class variable that stores the security check stage value initialised to 0. When a button in my application is pressed the code below is run to check that the user has permission to access their account screen. Depending upon a method parameter the appropriate handler method is called, which shows a PIN entry user control to the user this user control is a custom control that appears full screen and topmost. While the handler code is running the code shown below is calling Application.DoEvents in a do while loop to keep everything responsive while the user is entering their PIN. If the do while loop wasnt there the screen that the user is trying to access would appear on top of the PIN entry screen before we have a chance to valid that the user PIN is correct. When the PIN entry has passed the security check stage variable is set to 1, allowing the account screen to be shown.p  precode            try                              this.Cursor  Cursors.WaitCursor                  Application.DoEvents                  SecurityCheckStage  0                  Security              new tskSecuritytrue                 Security.TaskUpdate  new TaskUpdateHandlerhandler                  TaskManager.AddTaskSecurity, true                  this.Cursor  Cursors.Default                   Wait until security check has passed before showing account screen                 do                                      Application.DoEvents                     System.Threading.Thread.Sleep100                                  while SecurityCheckStage  0                  if SecurityCheckStage  1 ShowAccountScreen                  return false                          catch                              throw                          finally                              this.Cursor  Cursors.Default              codepre  pI am aware that calling codeApplication.DoEventscode in a loop is not good practice, so I really want to rework this code to make it better.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.

I understand that my 2 possibilities arep  ul lieither I dont use shelve and use another module to manage my simple database ex sqlite3 except it is a bit more complex than the simple shelve moduleli lieither I create a locking mechanism that will work on network by multiple machines so far I didnt find a module that seemed totally reliableli ul  pAdditional requirements if possible arep  ul liIt will mainly be used with Windows but I would like the solution to be crossplatform so that I can reuse it with Linuxli linetwork file system will be anything accessible through a standard explorer in linuxwindows through an address like MachineFolder. It could be either a file server or just a shared folder present on one of the machines. li ul  pAny recommendationp  pThanksp
Negative 12658 pIm trying to get a minimum Vaadin 7.1.12 app running spitting out a string from a session bean injected via CDI, on Wildfly final versionp  hr  pEDIT Problem solved  should have injected my gui component instead of using new.

However, creating error handling for every single query and making sure that the logic of the code stays the same not to mention staying readable throughout can be a somewhat tedious and error prone process.p  pI would like to know a bit more about what is going on behind the scenes when a query is sent, because it would help me a lot with some of my questions. Namely, is it really necessary to write codeif mysqliquerycode all the time for correct error handling, or is simply checking if the socalled master connection exists enoughp  pThat is, after I check codemysqliconnectcode, do I have to check every subsequent query within that connection to see if it went through connectionwise, not logicwise, or is it simply enough to check codemysqliconnectcode once, at the beginning of the program It would sure make things a lot easier.p  pAlso, while Im looking at codemysqlimultiquerycode for more practical query management, I would prefer not to use it until I can fully understand the simpler query functions.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 12658 pThe problem I have a site with a recently installed SSL certificate that is very dependent on POST calls over AJAX. The site worked fine on Internet Explorer 8 before the SSL certificate, but now does not.p  pSince I havent been able to get a good way to read any error messages, I havent been able to pin down where the bug is coming from. I will try to list as much as I know have figured out, and I greatly appreciate any suggestions.p  pWhat I knowp  ul liOn IE8, the site will not perform any AJAX POST calls that contain datali liThe site worked fine until recently. The SSL certificate has been the most significant change since we originally had the site working in IE8li liIf I change the AJAX call to use GET, or if I change it to use POST without sending any data, it reaches the server successfully. Unfortunately, the site requires using POST with data.li liThe site works perfectly on Chrome, FF, Safari, Opera, and IE11. I havent had the opportunity to test IE10 or IE9 since we found the bug. We wont really need to support lt IE8.li liI have tried to make a sample AJAX call using both vanilla JS and jQuery code for both is below. Neither has worked for IE8, and both have worked for everything else.li liThe AJAX call is being made to the same domain and even the same PHP file that is serving the main page, so there shouldnt be any issues with cross domain AJAX calls unless a bug is making it appear that wayli liAttempting to replicate the issue, I checked out another one of our sites that similarly uses SSL and has a lot of AJAX calls. It had the same issues at least we are consistent, but apparently has never been brought to our attention because apparently that client doesnt use IE8 in the workplace.li liWhen running on IE8, the call fails without throwing errors. In my vanilla JS test, I tried to alert the readyState and status on failure which returned 4 and 0 respectively. Strangely enough, IE8 threw an error on the alert that showed the readyState and status.li liI am testing on an emulated version of IE8 I have a Mac, so there is a possibility that my personal configuration on it is complicating things. However, I had a coworker test it also an emulator and he received the same result, and I am almost certain that the people who have reported problems were using IE8. I have enabled native XMLHTTP support in my install of IE8 that was apparently a common issueli liApparently another common issue with IE8 and AJAX is caching  I have tried setting the header cachecontrol to both nocache and public, and neither works.li ul  pHere is the vanilla JS codep  precodevar xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest xmlhttp.onreadystatechangefunction   if xmlhttp.readyState4 ampamp xmlhttp.status200            All the code that is supposed to run on success ...

Negative 12658 pBy default PHPUnit does not use colour output. One can add the codecolorscode flag to the codephpunitcode command or add codecolorstruecode to the config file.p  pId like to have colors by default and hence have the setting in my config file. This is nice since I can then run codephpunitcode rather than codephpunit colorscode most of the time. However I do have one place where the terminal does not support color output. When colors are enabled there, it makes the output less readable.p  pIs it possible to keep colors on by default and disable it for this specific terminal There appears to be no codenocolorscode flag or similar. And ideally Id not have to specify this anywhere to begin with, and be able to specify something like codecolorsautocode, which then detects if the terminal supports ANSI colors or not.p

Negative 12658 pIn my application I have to have an interface between a C class representing a data table and python, which needs to iterate over said table. The problem appears because the table records which of its rows and columns are selected and operates on them accordingly so sometimes the object is a table with only one column selected and the iterator should iterate over that columns, and sometimes it has more than one column selected and should iterate over the columns themselves.  Essentially the type of the iterator needs to change based on the internal state of the table.p  pIf this were pure C I would simply change it so that the indexing operator of the table returns a column rather than the table with that column selected however this will not work because of pythons slice operator, which could select zero or more columns, so the problem would be moved rather than solvedthis is why it doesnt return the individual columns currently.p  pIt seems like this should be easy to do because python is a dynamic language, so I just have to return the PyObject form of the iterator.  However I cant figure out how to use the wrapper declared with boostpython to convert the C object to a PyObject, or how to return it afterwardsi.e. does the boostpython wrapper want me to return a boostpythonobject or a PyObject, etc.p

He asked how do I solve the overflow problem, I answered by keeping track of how may times we exceed the max number and so forth, he said something about pushing into stack, the average and length, I never really understood his solution by pushing these 2 variables into some sort of list Anyone has a clue p

Negative 12658 pI am facing a problem while executing a Function written using PLpgSQL. The problem that I am facing is that when I execute the function manually using pgAdmin, the functions gets executed and the data gets loaded into the destination table. But when I execute the same function using a scheduler which has been developed by our team to execute all the different kinds of functions and ETLs based on the requirements, the postgreSQL function executes but doesnt COMMIT the data into the table. If we give a COMMIT statement after the function execution statement, only then the data gets committed. p  pCan any one suggest me what could be the possible reason for this behaviour of the function which get committed while executing manually but not when executed in a schedulerp  pI would be highly obliged if someone can help me with this at the earliest.p  pThanks in advance.p

Not sure if its a bug in ContentSearchLuncene.NET API or I am missing something BUT seems like what was posted a hrefhttpkamsar.netindex.php201304sitecore7linqgotchas relnofollowherea is probably not TRUE and if you have a complex field type  which you will  you can not query with a mapped class against Lucene.  not sure if this is also the case for Solr.

It looks like the test case code is using one database codetestltmydatabasenamegtcode and the view running on the dev server is accessing another the codeurllibcode call successfully contacts the view but cant find the product Ive asked for.p  pAny ideas why this may be the casep  pMight be relevant  were testing on a MySQL db instead of the sqlite.p  pemHeading off two questions but interested in comments if you think were doing this wrongemp  ul liI know It seems weird that the task accesses the view using codeurllibcode. We do this because the task usually calls one of a series of third party APIs to get info about a product, and if it cannot access these, it accesses our own Django database of products. The code that makes the urllib call is generic code that is agnostic of which case were dealing with.li liThese are integration tests so wed prefer actually make the codeurllibcode call rather than mock it outli ul

Negative 12658 pIm trying to implement offscreen rendering with OpenGL ES on Android. My ultimate goal is to improve performance of texture mapping which I do in plain java and Bitmapint[] APIs. I tried pbuffer approach, similar to the sample code from a a hrefhttpwww.anddev.organdroid2d3dgraphicsopengltutorialsf2possibletodoopengloffscreenrenderinginandroidt13232.html relnofollowrelevant forum threada. It shows rather low performance, codeglReadPixelscode call takes up to 50 ms on one device and up to 15 ms on another.p  pThere is more modern approach using Frame Buffers. The code samples are rather complicated and I dont expect much faster transfer from Frame Buffer to Androids Bitmaps than it was with pbuffers. Am I right with my estimationp  pThe third approach is using pixmaps. If I understood the docs right they should utilize more sophisticated memory sharing between OpenGL and Dalviks memory than plain copy. The problem is that relevant APIs arent present in the Android SDK.p  pThere is no codeeglCreateImageKHRcode and codeEGLImageKHRcode structure exposed in Java. All C examples I could find rely on them.p  pThere is codeeglCreatePixmapSurfacecode but I cant figure out how to use it from the docs. Probably it receives some kind of bitmap handle in the codenativepixmapcode parameter, but I cant find any way to create such a handle. Searching for eglCreatePixmapSurface android leads only to problem reports.p  pMy main question is can I use pixmaps on Android from Java without writing native code If I need to go native is there working code I can use to evaluate performance before diving deep into OpenGLp
Negative 12658 pLets say I have two tables codeContractscode and codeServiceProviderscode. A contract has a property codeLeadServiceProvidercode which references a service provider. p  pI also have a third table called codeSubServiceProviderscode that maintains a manytomany relationship between codeContractscode and codeServiceProviderscode acting as sub service providers.p  pId like to run a query on Contract that would give me a list of all service providers  Lead and Sub, together in one columnp  precodeSelect      c.LeadServiceProvider, subSP.ServiceProvider From      Contracts c  left join      SubServiceProviders subSP on c.ID  subSP.Contract Where      [Some contract criteria goes here] codepre  pThe query above gives me two columns that ideally I would like to flatten into one and run a codedistinctcode on. I could do a select for codeLeadServiceProvidercode and then codeUNIONcode it with a select for codeSubServiceProviderscode. p  pThat is simple enough for this example, but, in my actual application, the codeFROMcode and codeWHEREcode clauses are pretty complicated, and if Im to use codeUNIONcode, Im forced to repeat those clauses all over againp

How can I specify that the child elements of Thing should appear in alphabetical order by name when there is no attribute data for SQL to ORDER BYp  pAs I mentioned, this is a big bit of XML, with many different elements, which do not always all appear, so if there were some way to order all of the child elements at a certain level, without affecting the ordering of the grandchild elements without having to hardcode each element name, that would be really great.p  pI have searched all over the place to no avail for a method. I have looked at both an ex post facto xquery modify on my XML output which seems to me the most practical solution as some of the elements to be sorted have minOccurs  0, or as part of the design of the FOR XML EXPLICIT command which seems the most efficient as that way prevents rather than undoes the error but, of what I have understood, nothing seems to work.p  pI could, of course, remove the  constraints from the schema file, but would much rather avoid this if at all possible as giving in to inexactitude seems the wrong direction to step.p  pWith the above file, this is the outcome I would consider idealp  precodeltThingsgt   ltThinggt     ltLettersgt       ltLettergt         ltAlphaNamegtAltAlphaNamegt         ltPhoneticNamegtAyltPhoneticNamegt       ltLettergt       ltLettergt         ltAlphaNamegtBltAlphaNamegt         ltPhoneticNamegtBeeltPhoneticNamegt       ltLettergt     ltLettersgt   ltThinggt   ltThinggt     ltNumbersgt       ltNumbergt         ltNumericNamegt1ltNumericNamegt         ltWrittenNamegtOneltWrittenNamegt       ltNumbergt       ltNumbergt         ltNumericNamegt2ltNumericNamegt         ltWrittenNamegtTwoltWrittenNamegt       ltNumbergt     ltNumbersgt   ltThinggt   ltThinggt     ltRacecarsgt       ltRacecargt         ltColourgtRedltColourgt         ltRocketsgtYltRocketsgt       ltRacecargt       ltRacecargt         ltColourgtBlueltColourgt         ltRocketsgtNltRocketsgt       ltRacecargt     ltRacecarsgt   ltThinggt ltThingsgt codepre  pAs you can see, the three elements below Thing are now sorted alphabetically Letters,Numbers,Racecars but all elements within each of these are unchanged in order.p  pPlease let me know if you would like me to write out a codeSELECT ...

Its called the Assistant Editor Device Preview, where you are able to see the layout and layers of what is onscreen to see if maybe you have labels overlapping or going offscreen based on the device it is running on. If you want to check multiple device sized, just hit the plus icon in the lower left hand corner of this picture. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfTZ16.png altenter image description herep  pThis helped me find overlapping layers and sizing issues with the TableView.  I was able to see how it looked on each device size.p  pWhat also helps here sometimes to use the Pin menu. Sometimes the labels can run off screen because it doesnt know where the constraints of the cell are based on the device size. So your label can run offscreen if the label is based off of a landscape layout but the device is an iPhone 5 and is in Portrait for example. This is the Pin menup  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1laqK.png altenter image description herep  pHope that makes sense and gives some more color to the problem.  Let me know if you have any questions at all, thanks for the help everyonep

Negative 12658 pI am currently taking an AP Computer Science class in my school and I ran into a little trouble with one of my projects The project requires me to create a calculator that can evaluate an expression and then solve it. I have got most of that down, but I ran into a little trouble because my teacher asked me to use a while loop to continuously ask for input and display the answer, and I am stuck on that. To end the program the user has to type in quit and I cant use system.exit or any cheating thing like that, the program has to just run out of code.

Negative 12658 pIm a newbie to iOS development. Currently learning by following tutorials from iOS Apprentice by Matthijs Hollemans. Im using Xcode 6 and ObjectiveC to make the tutorial apps. p  pIn the books second tutorial, he teaches his readers how to build a todolist app with table views, navigation controllers, etc.p  pIn the beginning A custom Label with the text Label is placed in the prototype cell of the table. On running the app at this point, Label shows up in the app, as expected.p  pTo display custom text in the table view, he asks the readers to set the Tag identifier for the Label and then display custom text using the Tag as shown in the code below. This leads to abnormal behaviour. p  pWhat this does is that it displays Label on launching the app. However, on scrolling the text off the screen and then back on the screen, the custom text shows up.p  pTo resolve this, instead of setting the Tag identifier on the Label, I set it on the Table View Cell, in spite of the Author of the book specifically warning against doing this. I also had to remove the default text Label from the Label in the table view so that the custom text and Label dont overlap. p  pThis fixed the problem, but now Im confused as to what is the correct protocol to follow for setting the Tag identifier when it comes to using table views. Should the Tag be set on Table View Cell or the Label If it should be set on the Label then what could be the reason for me to run into this problemp  pHeres the code for the main ViewController.m p  precodeimport ViewController.h import ChecklistItem.h  interface ViewController   end  implementation ViewController       NSMutableArray  items    voidviewDidLoad       [super viewDidLoad]      items  [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity20]      ChecklistItem  item      item  [[ChecklistItem alloc]init]     item.text  Walk the dog     item.checked  NO     [items addObjectitem]      item  [[ChecklistItem alloc]init]     item.text  Brush teeth     item.checked  NO     [items addObjectitem]      item  [[ChecklistItem alloc]init]     item.text  Prepare breakfast     item.checked  NO     [items addObjectitem]      item  [[ChecklistItem alloc]init]     item.text  Soccer practice     item.checked  NO     [items addObjectitem]      item  [[ChecklistItem alloc]init]     item.text  Eat ice cream     item.checked  NO     [items addObjectitem]     voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning       [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]    data source method no.1 to get the number of rows in section for the table view  NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection       return [items count]     voidconfigureCheckmarkForCellUITableViewCell cell withChecklistItemChecklistItem  item       if the item is checked, display checkmark     if item.checked           cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryCheckmark       else           cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryNone            voidconfigureTextForCellUITableViewCell cell withChecklistItemChecklistItem  item       UILabel  label  UILabel [cell viewWithTag1000]     label.text  item.text     data source mathod no.2 to get the cell to display the row in the given index path  UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       UITableViewCell  cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierChecklistItem]      ChecklistItem  item  items[indexPath.row]      [self configureTextForCellcell withChecklistItemitem]     [self configureCheckmarkForCellcell withChecklistItemitem]      return cell     delegate method to handle taps on rows  void tableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       UITableViewCell  cell  [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]      ChecklistItem  item  items[indexPath.row]      [item toggleChecked]      [self configureCheckmarkForCellcell withChecklistItemitem]      [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPathindexPath animatedYES]    end codepre

Negative 12658 pIm implementing the iOS clientside of our Google Cloud Endpoints API, and want to know how Cloud Endpoints discovery documents get interpreted internally on iOS, so when I make changes on the Cloud Endpoints side add a field, change a field name, delete a field what happens to older clientsp  pI know that Cloud Endpoints exposes a REST JSON API for the JavascriptAngularJS side of things which we could tie into manually using something like AFNetworking on iOS. Im familiar with how to manage API changes on the client in that scenario, but if it makes sense to utilize the Toolkit SDK  RPC implementation, then Id rather do that.p  pIs this all handled by versioning the API, then So older clients would request an older version of the API Does the Google iOS SDK support semantic versioning then I could see version numbers getting out of control quickly if not.p  pNote this is the python version of GCE.p

Negative 12658 pBasically, Im creating hash navigation to take users directly to a page header, listed as a link on hover.p  pIm trying to pair codeh1code elements on various pages with their children codespan idcode values. The codeh1code text is the text displayed in each codehrefcode, and the codespan idcode value is the hash for the url.p  pIm using qTip2 to display the links under a parent li element, which takes the user to the page without a hash. Im using code.ajaxcode to fetch the codeh1code and codespan idcode values. Source code is directly from the qTip2 website, which can be found a hrefhttpqtip2.comguidescontent.ajax.element relnofollowherea.p  pThis works great what isnt working so great, however, is getting the hash values to match up with the codeh1code text values.p  pThe following code outputs everything but the hash perfectly. Im given only one of the codeidcode values instead of all of them.

Negative 12658 pIm in the process of writing a modal directive.  Id like to use angularui router to manage states within in the modal, but Im running into a hurdlep  pThe modal does not exist in the dom when the page first loads theyre dynamically added.  Which means the named uiview is not present.  Navigation works fine outside of the modal, but not inside of it.  I assume this is because angularui router isnt aware of that uiview  Is there any way to tell it to rescan the dom p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 12658 pI use delphi XE2. During my Main form OnCreate procedure I run some important elements, like login procedure and so on. My problem is, that when I show login form invoked by OnCreate procedure, my application is not visible on TaskBar  it became visible when main form became visible. The problem is, that when user covered my login form by another application, without icon on taskBar he might not know that my application already runs and try to start it again. He must use ctrltab to get my application login form.p  pNow question... How to force application  OS to show application icon on Taskbar when OnCreate procedure is not finishedp  pregards Mariop

Negative 12658 pIf a user registers for my plone site on a specific page, they get a modal form for registering. When they submit this, the modal asks if they want to log in now I cant imagine a circumstance that they wouldnt....

Negative 12658 pIn the KampR book p59 edit second edition, covering ANSI C, it is suggested that it is easier to split larger projects into multiple files. In each file, several libraries are included at the top as usual e.g. getop.c needs stdio.h, and so does stack.c and so does main.c.p  pThe snippets are something like thisp  precodemain.c include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include calc.h int mainvoid      etc    getop.c include ltstdio.hgt include ltctype.hgt include calc.h getop      code   stack.c include ltstdio.hgt include calc.h void pushdouble val      code  codepre  pI am having trouble figuring out how including the standard libraries several times in a project works. Of course, for the custom .c files to be able to access built in functions, we need to include codeinclude ltheader.hgtcode so that they are aware of the existence of codeprintfcode and codegetcharcode and so on, but wouldnt this approach increase the size of the final program if codestdio.hcode is included four times instead of once  if everything was placed in one filep  pKampR does point out that splitting a program over several files eventually makes it more difficult to maintain all the .h files.p  pI suppose what I am really asking is how does the compiler figure out the problem of one library being included several times in a project.p  pI have read up on using stronginclude guardsstrong, but it seems that is not needed for this implementation, as they deal with ensuring that identical bits of code arent included twice, as inp  pFile module.hp  precodeifndef MODULEH define MODULEH  struct foo      int member   endif  MODULEH  codepre  pFile mod2.hp  precodeinclude module.h codepre  pFile prog.cp  precodeinclude module.h include mod2.h codepre  pa hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiIncludeguard relnofollowrefsap

This allows the user to swipe between the pieces of media much like the Apple photos app.p  pWhen rotating the UICollectionView the CV loses its offset and thus I call scroll to offset in the willTransition method.p  precodevoidviewWillTransitionToSizeCGSizesize withTransitionCoordinatoridltUIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorgtcoordinator  [coordinator animateAlongsideTransitionnil completionidltUIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContextgt context          [self.collectionView setContentOffsetCGPointMakewidth  currentPage, 0.0]      [UIView animateWithDuration.2 animations         self.collectionView.alpha  1      completionBOOL finished           UICollectionViewCell cell  [self cellInView]          if[cell isKindOfClass[MediaImageCell class]]           else if[cell isKindOfClass[MediaVideoCell class]]             [MediaVideoCell cell cellFinishedRotating]          else if[cell isKindOfClass[MediaAudioCell class]]               ]  ] codepre  pThis causes the cells the have cellForRow called meaning many of my cells are being reconfigured and also makes the rotation look ugly.p  pI have seen apps that use a similar feature in which they have paged media which when rotated looks perfect, Twitter recent update, Box, DropBox.p  pAt the moment my CollectionView is using a subclassed Flow Layout but I am doing nothing special in this only setting the sectionInset and ScrollDirection.p  pHere is a link to a short video I made attempting to detail the issue without doing anything in the rotation method.p  pa hrefhttpgfycat.comOnlyMildCrayfish relnofollowVideo Linkap

Negative 12658 pIm building an Android app that needs to communicate with a server over TCP sockets. I know that networking should be done off the UI thread but Im not sure which threading approach to go with an IntentService or AsyncTask. I read that the you should use services if you have to run something continually in the background, and use AsyncTask for oneoff tasks but I find this rather vague. For my application I only need to communicate with the server on startup and when a user clicks some button, which would seem to favour AsyncTask since this seems like a oneoff task. What would be the benefit and downside of using AsyncTask over an IntentServicep

Negative 12658 pI have an App that is receiving a video file from another App that is working as a Server. While the App is saving the file received on the socket, the video stream starts playing the file which is under construction. In the code sample, after I press the btnStream, I press the btnPlay and App runs successfully. However, if the playing rate is greater than the download rate, an error will occur. I want to avoid this case. So I need to have a listener on the Video Playing that will pause the videoview when it predicts that this error will occur. I know a solution where if I know the video size, I can counter the bytes received and monitor how many seconds have been buffered and see if the videoview should pause or not. However, is it possible to do it without knowing the video file size Or having two threads that depends on each other Thanks. p  pNote the VideoView used is a custom one where it can play FileDescriptor.     p  precodebtnStream.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener                Override             public void onClickView v                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                 String s  etURL.getText.toString                 String ip  10.0.0.24                 int port  7878                 mct new VideoDownloadTaskip,port                 mct.execute                             final MediaController mediaController  new MediaControllerthis         mediaController.setAnchorViewmVideoView           Button btnPlay  Button findViewByIdR.id.button2         btnPlay.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener               Override             public void onClickView v                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                 try                      mVideoView.setVideoFDnew FileInputStreamnew FilesdcardtempVideo.mp4.getFD                  catch FileNotFoundException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                  catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                  mVideoView.seekTo0                 mVideoView.start                                  public class VideoDownloadTask extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Voidgt           String dstAddress         int dstPort         String response           Socket socketnull          VideoDownloadTaskString addr, int port             dstAddress  addr             dstPort  port                   Override         protected Void doInBackgroundVoid... arg0                   try                      socket  new SocketInetAddress.getByNamedstAddress, dstPort                  catch UnknownHostException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                  catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                     try                          ifsocketnullsocket.close                      catch IOException e1                           TODO Autogenerated catch block                         e1.printStackTrace                                                         File f  new FilesdcardtempVideo.mp4                  try                      f.createNewFile                  catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                  DataInputStream innull                 try                      in  new DataInputStream socket.getInputStream                  catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                  FileOutputStream videoFile  null                 try                      videoFile  new FileOutputStreamf                  catch FileNotFoundException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                  int len                 byte buffer[]  new byte[8192]                  try                      whilelen  in.readbuffer  1                          videoFile.writebuffer, 0, len                                       catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                   try                      videoFile.close                  catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                  try                      socket.close                  catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                               return null                   Override         protected void onPostExecuteVoid result              Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Done Downloading File,                         Toast.LENGTHLONG.show             super.onPostExecuteresult                  codepre
Negative 12658 pWhile developing an Android application I stumbled on a problem. I just started using Dagger so I know some basic concepts but when using it outside the scopes of tutorials and their use cases things become less clear.p  pSo to get to the point. In my application Im using MVP as described in this blog post a hrefhttpantonioleiva.commvpandroid relnofollowhttpantonioleiva.commvpandroidap  pSo at first I was injecting the Interactor class the one that handles the data to the Presenter class and everything was ok. But then I implemented methods that use SQLite database, so now there was a need to use Context in my Interactor class.p  pI cant figure out how should I do this properly My temporary fix was to exclude Dagger from my application and pass Context variable in constructor when creating Presenter class and then Interactor class inside presenter but Id like to use Dagger.p  pSo my current application looks somewhat like this.p  precodeMyActivity implements MyView             MyPresenter p  new MyPresenterthis, getApplicationContext  codepre  pConstructor inside MyPresenterp  precodeMyPresenterMyView view, Context context        this.view  view       MyInteractor i  new MyInteractorcontext  codepre  pAnd in constructor in codeMyInteractorcode I assign codeContextcode to a private variable.p  pI would only need to inject codeMyInteractorcode to codeMyPresentercode, because this is the part of application that will need to be tested against different implementations. But if it would be also possible to inject codeMyPresentercode to codeMyActivitycode, that would be great p  pI hope someone has some experience with what Im trying to achieve p
Negative 12658 pI have two columns codeDatacode and codeData1code, on worksheet named codeDatacode. I have same column names on sheet named codeMasterDatacode. I want to read the stuff on codeDatacode worksheet and copy to codeMasterDatacode based on the column names codeDatacode amp codeData1code. Also, lets say I have 10 data points that I copied over to codeMasterDatacode, next time I want to keep that data there, but copy new data from sheet codeDatacode to codeMasterDatacode, by checking for the 1st empty cell which in this case would be Cell Number 11 in specific column.

Negative 12658 pI am writing a WatchKit extension for an iPhone application. I share Core Data using App Groups. This is working, the data is shared.

Negative 12658 pI have a user repository in the application which works nicely for cases like this one p  precodeQuery FROM UserEntity ue WHERE ue.site.id  siteid           and ue.name  username User findByUsernameParamsiteid String siteId,                     Paramusername String userName codepre  pThere is now a new option in one of the user fields, which should prevent the user to appear anywhere in the application. So instead of modifying the whole application, Ive decided to modify just the queries in repositories with hardcoded clause like this p  precodeQuery FROM UserEntity ue WHERE ue.site.id  siteid           and ue.name  username and ue.state  Disabled User findByUsernameParamsiteid String siteId,                     Paramusername String userName codepre  pThe changed part is codeand ue.state  Disabledcodep  pThe problem is, that such query doesnt return anything no matter what the value of state is. p  pIve also tried codeue.state not like Disabledcode, but with the same result.  Ive seen a lot of examples of using codeQuerycode, but didnt find any with hardcoded clauses. Is that even possiblep
Negative 12658 pI am trying to create a Service in Automator that writes out a formatted date string.  I have written a JavaScript that does the job, but I cannot figure out to actually get the output string from the script.  I have tried log, console.log, this.console.log, write, and a few other commands that I have found out there.  I am not experienced at JavaScript at all I put this together piecemeal over a couple of hours.  Here is the code that I havep  precodeObjC.importCocoa rightNow  .NSDate.date dtFormatter  .NSDateFormatter.alloc.init dtFormatter.dateStyle  .NSDateFormatterFullStyle dtFormatter.timeStyle  .NSDateFormatterMediumStyle  formattedDate  dtFormatter.stringFromDaterightNow codepre  pI was under the impression from my reading that the final line of code would provide output, but this does not seem to be the case inside of the strongRun JavaScriptstrong Action in Automator.  When this code is run in Script Editor, the console displays the formatted date as expected.p  pThank you very much for any counsel.p
Negative 12658 pHow do you specify the criteria if you want to average a range of numbers but want to ignore errors using the AVERAGEIF functionp  pFor example, given the data belowp  precodeA1 1 A2 DIV0 A3 VALUE A4 5 A5 0 codepre  pI want to use the AVERAGEIFrange, criteria formula something like thisp  precodeAVERAGEIFa1a5,andltgtDIV0,ltgtVALUE                     or AVERAGEIFa1a5,ltgtError codepre  pIs there a way to specify a criteria to exclude errors  The answer I expect from the range is 2, the average of the three valid numbers 1, 5, amp 0.p  pI found, via searches, that there is a way to do this using an array formula or other functions, but I want to find out if there is a way to do this without an array formula or using another function.

Negative 12658 pId like to extend a Python 2.7 class that handles HTML or XML structures. At the moment Im fiddling with bs4, but thats probably not essential to this question.p  pI want to add a bunch of functions that do higherlevel operations say, manipulating entire table columns, sorting list subelements, etc. So I define a subclassp  precodeclass myBS4 bs4.BeautifulSoup     def sortChildrenself, keyPath,...     ... codepre  pFine so far. But the original class and related ones like Tag, NavigableString, etc. already have various methods that instantiate bs4 objects, such as newtag to make a Tag Element, newstring to make a NavigableString Text node, etc. Same with DOMbased classes, or probably any package that handles recursive data structures.p  pDoes that mean that I have to find every place in every bs4related class that instantiates a bs4related object, and subclass and override so they all instantiate my class instead That seems awfully tedious.p  pWorse, it seems very prone to subtle bugs. For example, the bs4 constructor constructs a quasiDOM tree from parsed HTML or XML but it may or may not call newtag while doing so. It may just say something likep  precodex  Tagdiv codepre  pIn which case, Id get instances of BeautifulSoup and Tag and NavigableString objects, mixed into my tree of myBS4 and myTag and myNavigableString objects. Calls would then fail when asked to do an extended operation on a nonextended node.p  pSo overriding newtag, etc. may not suffice the only way to know if you got all cases is to study or grep the entire bs4 implementation. And a bs4 update might be pretty likely to break it even though theres really no conceptual reason to touch bs4 itself at all.p  pIs there any clean way around this issue I thought about mixins, but as far as I can tell Id still have to subclass bs4 to pull in the mixin, so it wouldnt help. Am I completely missing somethingp

Negative 12658 pI am trying to get a better understanding of the codekindcode specification, so I wrote the following program.p  precodeprogram main   implicit none    realkind  selectedrealkind1  a1   realkind  selectedrealkind2  a2    print , Kind  , kinda1, Range  , rangea1   print , Kind  , kinda2, Range  , rangea2  end program main codepre  pThe program runs great. However, my question is not about codekindcode. My question is about using a do loop. I would like to make the program bigger, but I dont want to write out declaration and print statements over and over.p  pI dont think I have much choice on the declarations. I think I will have to write them out one at a time. Is that correctp  pHowever, I do think there is a way to use a do loop for the print statements.

Negative 12658 pI have a python script that I need to call lots of times around 160000 times and while I can do this in less that a second with hard C code, if I try to load and call a python script to do this, it will probably take hours I emthinkem that if I loaded the script once, then run the loaded script over and over, it will be significantly faster. Unfortunately, I dont know how to do this. I dont think I can load the file with codeifstreamcode, then use codePyRunSimpleStringcode on all the lines of the string. In case it isnt faster however, is it possible to return a 2D array in python, then convert that Array into a codestdvectorcodep

Negative 12658 pI have an sqlite lite database and I want it to be possible to insert values manually or read the database without being annoying to do.

That would be the most efficient way to implement it, but it makes it harder to read. Since each time you encounter a foreign key, you need to check the appropriate table.p  pNow what I was thinking was to replace Foreign keys with TEXT Foreign Keys to make links between tables. For example,  the form block table above would become something likep  precodepk  fkform             name         1   viewmonster        creature 2   viewmonster        modifier 3   viewmonster        single codepre  pIn that case, I am using the name of the form instead of its primary key. The primary key could remain to make sure each field is unique or it could also be removed.p  pThe advantage would be human readability, and also remove the need of a name to key conversion. For example a script could contain the line of codep  precodeopenform viewmonster codepre  pIn order to get the form blocks, I need query the form table to get the primary key before querying the form block table. But using name as a key allow me to query the form block directly.p  pI do understand that there could be performance issue. But in that case specifically, it is used to create a form. So it reads the tables once, generate the form objects and then its done. But if there is a huge amount of data, it might still be slow.p  pThe other issue I can see is misspelling the foreign key during insertion. p  pAs for key duplication, I will force users to have unique names like in MS access form names for example so it should not be an issue. The name will have to be unique.p  pI am trying to weight the pro and cons, so I was wondering p  pis there any other issues I am not aware ofp  pI am not sure if its worth the jump since in the end there should be a user interface to manipulate those data. So the user should not bother about keys themselves. But there are still many data format, especially document database, that do not use keys.

Negative 12658 pI would like to move a tile with drag and drop in Unity 2D. The tile is a sprite. The scene is an Unblock me or Blocked in like gameplay.p  pBecause the tiles in real life correspond to physical objects it seemed be to a good idea to model them with colliders and rigidbody. The border of the table surrunded with invisible colliders. I hoped these will constrain the moves of the tiles realistic, when the player moves them.p  pThen I implemented a simple mouse based drag and drop behavior which is worked perfectly except the moved tile penetrates to other tiles and the border, and sometimes jumps over them. Then I learned if I am overriding physics by explicitly setting transforms position which I do exactly in my drag and drop implementation, this will happen. OK I accept, I should set only forces, ect. on rigidbody never directly the position.p  pNow the questionp  pI am stuck here. I still want to drag and drop like user experience, and some realistic visual result. When in the real life a player moves a tile, it seems it is glued to its finger. How can I achieve this ot at least similar with just applying forces Any suggestions or point similar existing sampleblog codep  pI know as a backup plan I can omit all the physics and constrain the tile positions by code, and create some tweens to move the tiles.
