Positive 607 pIm taking a site that used to be static html generated by an offline tool and converting it to PHP.  Im sending all page urls to a single PHP file which parses the url.  At first I just stuck codeFallbackResource MyPage.phpcode in the .htaccess file, and it worked fine... except for urls with a fragment part.

Negative 607 pIve joined a team that works on a product. This product has been around for 5 years or so, and uses ASP.NET WebForms. Its original architecture has faded over time, and things have become relatively disorganized throughout the solution. Its by no means terrible, but definitely can use some work you all know what I mean.p  pIve been performing some refactorings since coming on to the project team about 6 months ago. Some of those refactorings are simple, Extract Method, Pull Method Up, etc. Some of the refactorings are more structural. The latter changes make me nervous as there isnt a comprehensive suite of unit tests to accompany every component. p  pThe whole team is on board for the need to make structural changes through refactoring, but our Project Manager has expressed some concerns that we dont have adequate tests to make refactorings with the confidence that we arent introducing regression bugs into the system. He would like us to write more tests first against the existing architecture, then perform the refactorings. My argument is that the systems class structure is too tightly coupled to write adequate tests, and that using a more Test Driven approach while we perform our refactorings may be better. What I mean by this is not writing tests against the existing components, but writing tests for specific functional requirements, then refactoring existing code to meet those requirements. This will allow us to write tests that will probably have more longevity in the system, rather than writing a bunch of throw away tests.p  pDoes anyone have any experience as to what the best course of action is I have my own thoughts, but would like to hear some input from the community.p
Negative 607 pthis is my first question to stackoverflow so here it goes...p  pI use cruise control for my continuous integration scheme, i want to use obfuscation in order to add another protection layer to my assemblies.

Suggestions that include other CI tools such as NAnt are also accepted. p  pCommercial tools are also an option so dont hesitate to include them in your answer. The applications that i am building and want to obfuscate are mostly written in Compact Framework 2.0, Dot Net 2.03.5.p  pAt the moment cruise control checks for changes in the repository, then based on the script for the specific solution downloads and builds the project by using devenv, after the setup project has been run it copies the setup file into a different folder and thats more or less it. So i need obfuscate somewhere in this process..p  pThanks in advance for any input.p

Negative 607 pI am trying to decide between two possible implementations and am eager to choose the best one p  pI need to add an optional BLOB field to a table which currently only has 3 simple fields. It is predicted that the new field will be used in fewer than 10, maybe even less than 5 of cases so it will be null for most rows  in fact most of our customers will probably never have any BLOB data in there.p  pA colleagues first inclination was to add a new table to hold just the BLOBs, with a nullable foreign key in the first table. He predicts this will have performance benefits when querying the first table.p  pMy thoughts were that it is more logical and easier to store the BLOB directly in the original table. None of our queries do codeSELECT code from that table so my intuition is that storing it directly wont have a significant performance overhead.p  pIm going to benchmark both choices but I was hoping some SQL gurus had any advice from experience.p  pUsing MSSQL and Oracle.p

Negative 607 pHow do you implement Roles and Security in your C Domain Driven Designs We have some debate raging on wether it should be implemented by the calling application ASP.NET MVC or in the Domain Model itself model entities and services. Some argue that it should be in the web site itself since thats where the authentication already exists. But that means you have to reimplement security every time you integrate with the core business systems.p  pstrongAs an examplestrong an Admin should be able to do pretty much any action in the system such as edit and deleting records ie they can delete a users order. A User on the other hand should only be able to edit and delete their own records ie they can addremove items from their shopping cart.p  pBTW Here is a nice thesis on the topic which covers 7 different scenarios regarding DDD amp Securityp  pa hrefhttpwwwhome.cs.utwente.nlpiressupervisionuitholmscthesis.pdfSecurity in DomainDriven Designap  ul liChapter 4 Security service design scenarios ul li4.1 Scenario 1 Security service as regular serviceli li4.2 Scenario 2 Security embedded in the UIli li4.3 Scenario 3 Security service encapsulating the domain modelli li4.4 Scenario 4 Security service as a gateway for the UIli li4.5 Scenario 5 Security service as an adapter for the UIli li4.6 Scenario 6 Security service integrated by AOP with adaptersli li4.7 Scenario 7 Security service integrated with AOPli ulli ul  pI would personally lean towards AOP using PostSharp but not having do much with it before Im hesitant to take the leap.p

Negative 607 pSo Ive got a simple web application using Spring MVC  Hibernate and am using the OpenSessionInViewFilter.  Ive recently been thinking of replacing the UI with something like Flex or GWT.p  pAt first I thought it would be easy, in that I can just hit my service layer from the new front end.  But as I consider this a bit more, Im a little bit nervous about the issues surrounding lazy loading.  Using a traditional web front end its no problem because Im using open session in view...everything that needs to get loaded for the view gets loaded as the view is constructed.p  pSo Lets say Ive got a method to return a Customer, and a Customer has a bunch of Contacts, and Contacts have a bunch of Addresses, and so on.  If I call getCustomer from my new RIA controller, its going to get a Customer, but the Customers collection of Contacts is just going to be a proxy or null.p  pI could create a new layer on top of what Ive already got that returns DTOs which are prepopulated...but... that seems like its going to get complicated.p  pAny advicep

Negative 607 pOOP is about programming with interface, not the implementation. Objects are talking to each other using their interfaces. When interfaces are not well defined one object can know too much about the other and if you need to change implementation of your object youll need to change your programm in different places. Thats really bad, its all about changing things in one place and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDon27t5Frepeat5Fyourself relnofollowDRYa principles. So my question is the following what if make interface context. Interface context will make sure that if object provides multiple interfaces other objects will only be able to use the one they need. This will ease things and reduce possibility of errors. p  pLet me introduce the example some abstract class that let us read text and write text. So it has two interfaces reader and writer. If you are dealing with reader, all you need is reader methods. So we can remove the writer interface. In the real world youll still see the reader part in IDEs like Visual Studio. But what if make such a thing that would allow you to declare Im in the reader context and youll be able to do things only related to reading and every class will show you its reader related interface. What do you think Does it make sense Like addins to Visual Studio that will hide other interfaces when set to onep

Negative 607 pIm taking an algorithm course at the university, and for one of my projects I want to implement a redblack tree in C the implementation itself isnt the project, yet just something i decided to choose to help me out.p  pMy redblack tree should hold string keys, and the object i created for each node looks like this p  precodeclass sRbTreeNode      public sRbTreeNode Parent  null     public sRbTreeNode Right  null     public sRbTreeNode Left  null     public String Color     public String Key      public sRbTreeNode                public sRbTreeNodeString key              Key  key       codepre  pI already added some basic methods for printing the tree, finding the root, minmax key by alphabet, etc...p  pIm having trouble inserting nodes hence, building the tree. Whoevers familiar with redblack trees knows that when adding a node to one side, you could have changed the balance of the tree. To fix this, you need to rotate around nodes on the tree in order to balance the tree out.p  pI wrote a RightRotate and LeftRotate method in pseudocode, and then when i tried to implement it in C, i ran into a bunch of reference problems with the sRbTreeNode object i created.p  pThis is the pseudocode I wrote for the LeftRotate method p  precodeLeftRotateroot, node     y lt node.Right     node.Right lt y.Left     if y.Left  null         y.Left.Parent lt node     y.Parent lt node.Parent     if node.Parent  null         root lt y     else         if node  node.Parent.Left             node.Parent.Left  y         else             node.Parent.Right  y     y.Left lt node     node.Parent lt y codepre  pI received a suggestion to implement it straight forward, but without using the ref keyword, which i tried at first. This is how i did it p  precodepublic static void LeftRotatesRbTreeNode root, sRbTreeNode node              sRbTreeNode y  node.Right         node.Right  y.Left         if y.Left  null             y.Left.Parent  node         y.Parent  node.Parent         if node.Parent  null             root  y         else             if node  node.Parent.Left                 node.Parent.Left  y             else                 node.Parent.Right  y         y.Left  node         node.Parent  y      codepre  pNow, when i debug, i see that it works fine, but the objects i pass to this method are only rotated within the scope of the method. When it leaves this method, it seems like there was no change to the actual nodes. That is why i thought of using the ref keywords in the first place.p  pWhat am i doing wrong p

Negative 607 pFor about a year I have been thinking about writing a program that writes programs.  This would primarily be a playful exercise that might teach me some new concepts.  My inspiration came from a hrefhttpsimple.wikipedia.orgwikiNegentropy relnofollownegentropya and the ability for order to emerge from chaos and new chaos to arise out of order in infinite succession.  p  pTo be more specific, the program would start by writing a short random string.  If the string compiles the programs will log it for later comparison.  If the string does not compile the program will try to rewrite it until it does compile.  As more strings mini useless programs are logged they can be parsed for similarities and used to generate a grammar.  This grammar can then be drawn on to write more strings that have a higher probability of compilation than purely random strings.p  pThis is obviously more than a little silly, but I thought it would be fun to try and grow a program like this. And as a byproduct I get a bunch of unique programs that I can visualize and call art.p  pIll probably write this in Ruby due to its simple syntax and dynamic compilation and then I will visualize in processing using rubyprocessing. p  pWhat I would like to know isp  ul liIs there a name for this type of programming li liWhat currently exists in this fieldli liWho are the primary contributorsli liBONUS  In what ways can I procedurally assign value to output programs beyond compilesyn brI may want to extend the functionality of this program to generate a program based on parameters, but I want the program to define those parameters through running the programs that compile and assigning meaning to the programs output. This question is probably more involved than reasonable for a bonus, but if you can think of a simple way to get something like this done in less than 23 lines or one hyperlink, please toss it into your response.     li ul  pI know that this is not quite metaprogramming and from the little I know of AI and generative algorithms they are usually more goal oriented than what I am thinking.

Negative 607 pMany aspects of my site are dynamic. I am using jquery.p  pI have a div which once the DOM is ready is populated using load.p  pThen if a button is clicked, using load once again, this value is replaced by another value.p  pThis kind of setup is common across my site. My homepage is essentially lots of dynamically loaded, refreshed, and changeable content.p  pWhat are the repercussions of this for SEOp  pIve seen sites where each page is loaded using load and then displayed using the animation functions... It looks awesome p  pPeople have posed this question before, but noone has answered it properly.p  pSo any ideas JQUERY AND SEOp  pThanksp  pEDITp  pVery interesting points. I dont want to overdo my site with jaascript.. just where neccesary to make it look good  my homepage however is one place of concern. p  pSo when the DOM is readY, it loads content into a div. On clicking a tab, this content is changed. I.E No JS, No content. p  pThe beauty here for me is that, there is no duplicated code. Is the suggestion here that i should simply print some default content, then have the tabs link to pages with the same content if JS is disabled. I.E sacrifice a little duplicate code for SEOp  pAs far as degrading goes, my only other place of concern is tabs on the same page.. I have 3 divs, all containing content.

Negative 607 pIm using Qt 4.7 QPainter to draw some polygons, etc into a widget.

Negative 607 pI need to replace a directory in my SVN repository on the production server, but am not sure of the correct way to do this without breaking anything.  The directory being replaced is a thirdparty module revision that has been completely restructured, so in order to upgrade cleanly I need to deleted the old directoryfiles and replace with the new directory and files.  When I do this using svn delete the working copy becomes obstructed or in a state that prevents me from committing or adding the new, unversioned directory to the working copy.  Ive tried svn update, svn cleanup, as well as other UI TortoiseSVN and Cornerstone fixit shortcuts, but cant seem to get things resynced  that is without rolling back to a previous revision or checking out a new copy.p  pI believe that the target directory on both the local working copy and remote repo have to be deleted, the working copy updated, the new directory added to the working copy and then committed to the repo but I am unsure of the specifics or any missing steps or subtleties that I may be missing.  The module that I am upgrading is pretty vital to the site application, so I need to get this right the first time  as this is being made on the production server  and has to be done quickly.  If someone could map the steps out clearly, I would really appreciate it.p

Negative 607 pI have an codeActivitycode containing a codeViewFlippercode and would like to show a different option menu for each view in that codeViewFlippercode. That is, the type of menu displayed when the menu button is pressed would depend on the type of the current view.

How could I solve thisp  pAny suggestions appreciated.p

Negative 607 pIm using Unreal Engine to build a game, most parts are done in Visual Studio in windows, except build the iPhone release.p  pThe Xcode project contains nothing but an Info.plist and the Game.app, which is build with external gcc amp g commands.

Negative 607 pI have been working on a program that has 3 classes of which 2 of the classes have timers that repeat at different intervals and once one cycle of the timer is done it raises an event with a string as return. The 3rd class subscribes to the events from the other two timer classes and prints them to screen. it works greatp  pBut my issue is that it is printing them separately. Lets say that the first timer class runs and then raises hello every 2 minutes and the other class dog every second and every time an event is raised it prints the raised event to console. I would want it to instead print hellodog every second and store the value of the first timerhello in a private field or something so it still prints to screen even if the timerthe slower 2 minute timer hasnt been fired. and when the 2 minute timer fires it updates the value to whatever the new one is and that new value get printed to screen until it fires again.p  pIf it is confusing I will gladly clarify. its kind of hard to explain.p  precodenamespace Final      public class Output              public static void Main                      var timer1  new FormWithTimer             var timer2  new FormWithTimer2              timer1.NewStringAvailable  new EventHandlerltBaseClassThatCanRaiseEvent.StringEventArgsgttimer1NewStringAvailable              timer2.NewStringAvailable  new EventHandlerltBaseClassThatCanRaiseEvent.StringEventArgsgttimer2NewStringAvailable             Console.ReadLine                   static void timer1NewStringAvailableobject sender, BaseClassThatCanRaiseEvent.StringEventArgs e                      var theString  e.Value              To something with theString that came from timer 1             Console.WriteLinetheString                   static void timer2NewStringAvailableobject sender, BaseClassThatCanRaiseEvent.StringEventArgs e                      var theString2  e.Value              To something with theString2 that came from timer 2             Console.WriteLinetheString2                    public abstract class BaseClassThatCanRaiseEvent              public class StringEventArgs  EventArgs                      public StringEventArgsstring value                              Value  value                           public string Value  get private set                    The event itself that people can subscribe to         public event EventHandlerltStringEventArgsgt NewStringAvailable          protected void RaiseEventstring value                      var e  NewStringAvailable             if e  null                 ethis, new StringEventArgsvalue                    public partial class FormWithTimer  BaseClassThatCanRaiseEvent              Timer timer  new Timer          public FormWithTimer                      timer  new System.Timers.Timer200000              timer.Elapsed  new ElapsedEventHandlertimerTick  Everytime timer ticks, timerTick will be called             timer.Interval  200000              Timer will tick evert 10 seconds             timer.Enabled  true                        Enable the timer             timer.Start                               Start the timer                   void timerTickobject sender, EventArgs e                      ...

Negative 607 pIve been dabbling around a bit with C and I find that being able to directly manipulate bits is fascinating and powerful and dangerous I suppose. I was curious as to what the best way would be to compare different bits in C would be. For instance, the number 15 is represented in binary asp  precode00001111 codepre  pAnd the number 13 is represented asp  precode00001101 codepre  pHow would you compare what bits are different without counting them It would be easy to use shifts to determine that 15 contains 4 1s and 13 contains 3 1s, but how would you output the difference between the two ex that the 21 spot is different between the two I just cant think of an easy way to do this. Any pointers would be much appreciatedp  pEDIT I should have clarified that I know XOR is the right way to go about this problem, but I had an issue with implementation. I guess my issue was comparing one bit at a time and not generating the difference per say. The solution I came up with isp  precode void compareint vector1, int vector2                int count  0       unsigned int xor  vector1  vector2       while count lt bitlength            if xor  2  1  would indicicate a difference                printfd , count                      xor gtgt 1            count            codepre

Negative 607 pI have a single UTF8 encoded String that is a chain of key  value pairs that is required to be loaded into a Properties object. I noticed I was getting garbled characters with my intial implementation and after a bit of googling I found this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions863838problemwithjavapropertiesutf8encodingineclipseQuestiona which indicated what my problem was  basically that Properties is by default using ISO88591. This implementation looked likep  precodepublic Properties loadString propertiesString          Properties properties  new Properties         try              properties.loadnew ByteArrayInputStreampropertiesString.getBytes          catch IOException e              logger.errorExceptionUtils.getFullStackTracee                  return properties      codepre  pNo encoding specified, hence my problem. To my question, I cant figure out how to chain  create a codeReadercode  codeInputStreamcode combination to pass to codeProperties.loadcode that uses the provided codepropertiesStringcode and specifies the encoding. I think this is mostly due to my inexperience in IO streams and the seemingly vast library of IO utilities in the java.io package.p  pAny advice appreciated.p

I can then cycle the contents of the label  1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3 etc and backward with the buttons.  As soon as I terminate the application using CommandQ. When I want to start it again, it crashes on p  precodecurrentItem[currentItem valueForKeyPrevious] codepre  porp  precodecurrentItem[currentItem valueForKeyNext] codepre  pinside the handleButtonClick method. And it is the same when I put the app on my iPod touch.p  pCan anyone see in my code anything that could explain this behaviorp

If I look at firebug, I dont see my specified getmarkerid.js in the section of my code. If I refresh the page, the .js file appears and all is fine, all functions were found and work perfectly.p  pAs a workaround I figuered out that to give the Tag of the Navigation an coderelexternalcode attribute solves this problem because the site is loaded completely and not from an ajax call. p  pNow I want to know if I can solve the problem with an better workaround  Because if I use the coderelexternalcode the mobile Safari opens a new Tab, if I had saved the Page to my homescreen and this is what my customers not want .

Negative 607 pIve come to seek your collective wisdom. p  pMy goal, an overview In order to better manage computers for various clients, Im attempting to extend Puppets a hrefhttpwww.example.com relnofollowDashboarda. Its a Rails 2 application, and Im trying to extend it with a Rails 3 application Im writing. There are a few problems that make Dashboard less than perfect for my needs, but the solutions are simple. Im going to focus on one, because I feel that the answer to this question will help me figure the rest out. Ive been looking into solutions that dont alter the dashboard code at all, because Im not the maintainer, and dont want to make a future mess.p  pI thought a lot about how to do this best. I thought about plugging directly into the database but I got cold feet after doing a little googling. It appears that setting up a second database connection isnt that difficult, the thing I dont like is altering another applications database while its running. Please say something if Im passing up a perfectly reasonable option, based on superstition. p  pThere were a few other ideas, but the one that I started in on finally, and had marginal success with was accessing Dashboards database via REST. Its built in, why not use it Well, I was able to manipulate a couple of the tables, but not the one that I wanted to. So there are three tables to be aware of in this situation.p  ol linodes basically computersli linodegroups the groups you can put computers inli linodegroupmemberships the join table that relates 1 and 2 to each otherli ol  pI can add and remove both nodes, and nodegroups, but I want to be able to create a connection between the two as well. In order to create a new user, I have an ActiveResource model set up that looks like thisp  precodeclass PuppetNode lt ActiveResourceBase                                                                                                                                                      self.site  http127.0.0.14000                                                            self.elementname  node                                                                     attraccessor grouped           end                                                                                             codepre  pIm then free to create new nodes, or grab info from the nodes table via the console. It might look something like thisp  precodePuppetNode.createcolumnname gt and so on codepre  pThe same goes for nodegroups, and I can even create a Rails 3 model that doesnt wig out for nodegroupmemberships, but I cant create anything in that table. I can see if I look at the Rails 2 nodegroupmembership controller by the good folks over at Puppet Labs, that there is a create methodp  precodeclass NodeGroupMembershipsController lt InheritedResourcesBase   respondto json   beforefilter raiseifenablereadonlymode, only gt [new, edit, create, update, destroy]   beforefilter standardizepostdata, only gt [create]    def create     create do success, failure       success.json  render text gt nodegroupmembership.tojson, contenttype gt applicationjson, status gt 201        failure.json  render text gt .tojson, contenttype gt applicationjson, status gt 422      end   end     we want nodegroupmembership gt nodeid gt ltidgt, nodegroupid gt ltidgt    allow and convert nodename gt ltnamegt, groupname gt ltnamegt   def standardizepostdata     unless params[nodegroupmembership]       params[nodegroupmembership]         node   Node.findbynameparams[nodename]       group  NodeGroup.findbynameparams[groupname]       params[nodegroupmembership][nodeid]  node ampamp node.id       params[nodegroupmembership][nodegroupid]  group ampamp group.id     end   end end codepre  pBut for whatever reason it chokes out every time I try to create an association with something like this p  precodeirbmain0050gt PuppetNodeGroupMembership.createnodeid gt 20, nodegroupid gt 5  gt ltPuppetNodeGroupMembership0x007fb3150af878 attributesnodeidgt20, nodegroupidgt5, prefixoptions, persistedfalse, remoteerrorsltActiveResourceResourceInvalid Failed.

Negative 607 pIm currently developing a maven osgi bundle using Netbeans 7.1. While its easy to create new maven osgi bundle project from netbeans, Ive been struggling about how I would run it.

Negative 607 pThe problem When I clear and repopulate my ListView, if an item was previously checked, the item at the same index is checked as well.  If the number of elements added to the adapter lt the index of the previously checked item, nothing is checked.p  pIve tried blocking the use of convertView even if it exists but that has no effect.  Strangely, when I stepped through the debugger to see what is going on and I see that repopulating the adapter results in one or more calls to setCheckedtrue in CheckableLinearLayout.

Negative 607 pIm playing around with MongoDB for the moment to see what nice features it has.  Ive created a small test suite representing a simple blog system with posts, authors and comments, very basic.p  pIve experimented with a search function which uses the MongoRegEx class PHP Driver, where Im just searching through all post content and post titles after the sentence lorem ipsum with case sensitive on I.p  pMy code looks like this  p  precoderegex  new MongoRegExlorem ipsumi   query  arraypost gt regex, posttitle gt regex codepre  pBut Im confused and stunned about what happens.  I check every query for running time set microtime before and after the query and get the time with 15 decimals.p  pFor my first test Ive added 110.000 blog documents and 5000 authors, everything randomly generated. When I do my search, it finds 6824 posts with the sentence lorem ipsum and it takes 0.000057935714722 seconds to do the search. And this is strongafterstrong Ive reset the MongoDB service using Windows and this is without any index other than the default on id.p  pMongoDB uses a Btree index, which most definitely isnt very efficient for a full text search.  If I create an index on my post content attribute, the same query as above runs in 0.000150918960571, which funny enough is slower than without any index slower with a factor of 0.000092983245849.  Now this can happen for several reasons because it uses a Btree cursor.p  pBut Ive tried to search for an explanation as to how it can query it so fast. I guess that it probably keeps everything in my RAM Ive got 4GB and the database is about 500MB. This is why I try to restart the mongodb service to get a full result.p  pCan anyone with experience with MongoDB help me understand what is going on with this kind of full text search with or without index and definitely without an inverted indexp  pSincerely   Mestikap

Negative 607 pSo in my javascript code, there is a part where if the user clicks on the checkbox I need to change the time delay used by codesetIntervalcode. At the moment, I used the codeonchangecode handler on the checkbox. Whenever the checkbox is changed, I call codeclearIntervalcode and codesetIntervalcode.

Negative 607 pIm writing a graphical editor for a model i.e. a collection of boxes and lines with some kind of semantics, such as UML, the details of which dont matter here. So I want to have a data structure representing the model, and a diagram where an edit to the diagram causes a corresponding change in the model.  So if, for instance, a model element has some text in an attribute, and I edit the text in the diagram, I want the model element to be updated.p  pThe model will probably be represented as a tree, but I want to have the diagram editor know as little about the model representation as possible. Im using the a hrefhttpprojects.haskell.orgdiagramsdiagramsa framework, so associating arbitrary information with a graphical element is easy. There will probably be a model class to encode the interface, if I can just figure out what that should be.p  pIf I were doing this in an imperative language it would be straightforward Id just have a reference from the graphical element in the diagram back to the model element. In theory I could still do this by building up the model from a massive collection of IORefs, but that would be writing a Java program in Haskell.p  pClearly, each graphical element is going to have some kind of cookie associated with it that will enable the model update to happen. One simple answer would be to give each model element a unique identifier and store the model in a Data.Map lookup table. But that requires significant bookkeeping to ensure that no two model elements get the same identifier. It also strikes me as a a hrefhttpwww.globalnerdy.com20100509newprogrammingjargonstringly typeda solution you have to handle cases where an object is deleted but there is a dangling reference to it elsewhere, and its difficult to say anything about the internal structure of the model in your types.p  pOn the other hand a hrefhttpokmij.orgftpcontinuationszipper.htmlzipper2Olegs writingsa about zippers with multiple holes and cursors with clear transactional sharing sounds like a better option, if only I could understand it. I get the basic idea of list and tree zippers and the differentiation of a data structure. Would it be possible for every element in a diagram to hold a cursor into a zipper of the model So that if a change is made it can then be committed to all the other cursors Including tree operations such as moving a subtree from one place to anotherp  pIt would particularly help me at this point if there was some kind of tutorial on delimited continuations, and an explanation of how they make Olegs multicursor zippers work, that is a bit less steep than Olegs postingsp

Negative 607 pIm trying to implement a a hrefhttpvenko.byethost14.com relnofollowsimple blckjack gamea, the problem is that the timeOut function is not working as I expect. I wrote some debugging messages to help you understand what I mean. With two words what I see is that the function is called once and than for some reason it exits from the function, program continues executing itself and than retunrs to the timeOut function... What I want is to pause the program execution to wait user to choose whether to request new card ot to stop. Thank you in advancep

Negative 607 pIve recently started on an MVC project, and right now it seems like every 5 minutes Im facing large pivotal design decisions on how I want to go with this thing. Always the way, rightp  pI have decided to keep my domain model classes entirely out of Views it will lead to a large amount of similarlooking ViewModels but using AutoMapper I dont think it will be a problem, and I think it is a nice clean approach.p  pHowever, my latest debate surrounds display logic. Say I have a model codeMyDatacode with a property of type codeStatuscode. This is an enum like the followingp  precodepublic enum Status     Ok,    NotTooGreat,    CouldBeBetter,    Awful  codepre  pIn a view, when I am rendering this model, I would like to output the status and additionally colour the output according to how bad the situation is. e.g. If its codeOkcode, Ill show green, if its codeNotTooGreatcode or codeCouldBeBettercode than yellow, otherwise red for codeAwfulcode.p  pWhere should this logic live Ultimately the colour choice itself will be within the View e.g. determine what css class to output, that class controls the colour, but determining what the state is at all is a decision that I dont think should be in the view. Possible options arep  ol lipUse DataAnnotations in a custom ViewModel class, e.g.p  precodepublic class MyDataViewModel       Amongst other MyData properties required...      public StatusViewModel Status    public enum StatusViewModel      [StatusDisplayDisplayState.Ok]     Ok,     [StatusDisplayDisplayState.Warning]     NotTooGreat,     [StatusDisplayDisplayState.Warning]     CouldBeBetter,     [StatusDisplayDisplayState.Error]     Awful  codepre  pThis means my mapping is fairly dumb and can just map the enums over by value. The View would then rely on a HtmlHelper to alter the output according to the DataAnnotation. This seems fairly straightforward, but is this putting too much business logic in the ViewModel That said, isnt this just a UI concern so its entirely valid for the ViewModel to define what the display state is Could I potentially end up with a ton of custom DataAnnotations this way Could these not get bloated, if I needed to also state which actions could be performed by a user according to the current statepli lipKeep the ViewModel simple, and rely on Mapping code to house the logicp  precodepublic class MyDataViewModel        Amongst other MyData properties required...       public string StatusText       public DisplayState Status  codepre  pThis means the ViewModel has no knowledge about what state is tied to what DisplayState, it just knows what different DisplayStates there could be i.e. Ok, Warning or Error. However this requires that logic to then sit within mapping code which doesnt feel like mapping to me  until now the maps between Model  ViewModel have been pretty straightforwards calls by the Controller  but perhaps thats an unnecessary fearpli lipThis emshouldem be in the view, the ViewModel should stay the same as the Model and then some code either in the View or an HtmlHelper for it will decide what class to output, based on what the codeStatuscode is.pli ol  pI think I am leaning towards number 1, but I would appreciate the views of others. One thing that comes to mind is that this is quite a simple example, but what if the View was much more complicated Say, if codeMyDatacode has a status of codeOkcode, we wanted to display many more properties from the codeMyDatacode Model to the user, or pull data in from other Model classes toop

Negative 607 pI am doing a bunch of logging when Im testing my application which is useful for getting information about variable state and such.p  pHowever I have read that you should use logging sparsely in production code because it can potentially slow down your application. But my question is now if my app is in production and people are using it, whenever a crash god forbid occurs, how will I be able to interpret the crash information if I have removed the logging statements Then I suppose I will only have a stacktrace for me to interpretp  pDoes this mean I should leave logging in production code only WHERE its really essential for me to interpret what has happenedp  pAlso how will the logging statements relate to the crash reports Will they be combined Im thinking of using a hrefhttpwww.flurry.com relnofollowFlurrya as analytics and crash reports...p

Negative 607 pI have written two classes, codeFullScreencode, which contains the logic for the screenshot, and codeFullScreenGUIcode, which contains the logic for simulating the emphoto clickem effect.p  pThe emphoto clickem effect is basically flashing the screen with white color for a short period of time, say 50ms after the screenshot is taken. It is produced by covering the whole screen by a codeJFramecode with an opacity of 1. The background is made white and then the opacity is changed from 1 to 100, kept like that for 50ms, then back to 1.p  pThe codeFullScreencode constructor takes two parameters, one for number of times to take screenshot, and the other for the duration in between.p  pThe codeFullScreenGUIcode constructs a codeJFramecode, maximises it, sets the background to white. When the codefirecode method is called, it changes the opacity as required to produce the effect.p  pstrongThe Questionstrong p  pUsing the code below I am able to produce the effect for the first time the screenshot is taken, but not for the subsequent clicks. Suppose, codeFullScreencode constructor is called with the parameters code4,2code i.e. to take 4 clicks each at 2 seconds duration, then the effect is produced nicely for the first click but not for the remaining 3 clicks. codeJFramecode of the codeFullScreenGUIcode does not seem to come to front, so the effect is not visible. I have tried codeJFrame.setAlwaysOnToptruecode, codeJFrame.toFrontcode but they dont seem to bring the codeJFramecode to the top.p  pThere is no problem in taking the screenshot, but instead with the effect.

Negative 607 pI am developing an application in android that needs to determine the amount of acceleration in a car when braking. I have found out how to get the pitch and roll angles, but I am at a loss on how to calculate the relative acceleration coordinates using the angles.p  pFor instance, if the device is sitting in a dock on the dash board, it is tilted forward at 15deg and tilted sideways at 5deg. When the person hits the brakes the acceleration due to braking will be distributed between the X, Y and Z axis. How do I use the pitch and roll to determine the acceleration in the Z direction relative to the earthp  pI have included a picture for reference In the picture I am trying to calculate Zprime based just off of the Y and Z axis, however in the real world, I will also need to use the X axis and also calculate Yprime and Xprime.p  pThank you for your help. and sorry for the bad handwriting img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com39hAk.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 607 pI cant seem to find a good answer to this anywhere. When using the none  custom mobile app service in the configuration for MobileESP in Joomla it seems like you are required to enter the device detection functions used.p  pInstead of entering every mobile device specifically windows phone 7 os, ios, blackberry etc, isnt there a single setting that covers all mobile devices I havent been able to find that, but kind of expected it to exist.

Negative 607 pI have successfully managed to register a region or monitoring, I know this because the codedidStartMonitoringForRegioncode method was fired.p  pI have a simple test app with one codeMKMapViewcode where I can see my current location, I also have my region drawn on the map as a red circle so I can actually physically see at what point I am entering or exiting this region. In the codedidEnterRegioncode and codedidExitRegioncode methods I have a codeUIAlertViewcode that fires.p  pA little while ago I decided to leave the office and take a walk with my iPhone 4, to see if this would work. I started in the middle of the region which is about 200m in radius, my app was in the foreground the whole time. I walked a couple blocks and exited the region, nothing happened.p  pI read on SO I think that sometimes it only works when you exit the region by a certain distance, so I kept on walking.p  pAfter another 200m or so I gave up as the codeUIAlertViewcode still wasnt showing, and started to walk back. Obviously, upon reentering the region, codedidEnterRegioncode wasnt firing either.p  pI am not calling code[locationManager startUpdatingLocation]code anywhere in my code, should I be Im only really creating the region and calling code[locationManager startMonitoringForRegion]code.p  pThe codeCLLocationManagerDelegatecode is my app delegate, and it seems fine as my codedidStartMonitoringForRegioncode is firing properly.p  pAm I missing anything elsep

Negative 607 pI am using Backbone.js to build a hybrid web app, which will be served as a native app using Phonegap. One thing I need is offline support for a large amount of data, and so we are considering using native code to synchronise the offline data with the server, and just transfer the bits of data we need to the web app when necessary. An alternative approach we considered was using the Phonegap storage plugin but this is backed by WebSQL which seems to have a 5MB quota, which is too small for what we need.p  pAs the app is based on Backbone.js, which expects a RESTful API as its backend, we are toying with the idea of embedding a a hrefhttpsgithub.commattstevensRoutingHTTPServer relnofollowRoutingHTTPServera into the native layer  essentially this allows us to embed a local web server in the app, so that the web layer can request data using standard RESTful calls to the local server.

Negative 607 pWere trying to create a property that when set in XAML can either take a direct value or a codeBindingcode object. Note, we want to store the codeBindingcode strongemobjectemstrong, not what it evaluates to.p  pFor the latter case, this works if the property is of type codeBindingcode but not if its of type codeobjectcode, which is needed for the former case of taking a direct value.p  pIm wondering if theres any way to decorate the property to say If someone sets a binding on you via XAML, store the codeBindingcode object itself, not what it evaluates to in essence doing the same thing as if it were of type codeBindingcode but still allowing it to receive other values.p  pHeres a walkthrough to clarify what were trying to do.  As you know, you can have this...p  precodepublic class MyClass      public object Content get set   codepre  pThen using XAML you can create an instance of it and set its MyValue property like this...p  precodeltlocalMyClass ContentHello World gt codepre  pThat works fine and stores the string in the property, but if you try this...p  precodeltlocalMyClass ContentBinding SomePath gt codepre  p...it fails because MyClass is not a DependencyObject so it cant set the binding, which isnt what we want anyway.  However, if you change the property definition to this...p  precodepublic class MyClass      public Binding Content get set   codepre  pIt now works Instead of attempting to evaluate the binding, it passes the codeBindingcode strongemobjectemstrong itself to the property setter.  In other words, you arent attaching a binding, youre storing a codeBindingcode object.p  pSince we now have the codeBindingcode object, we can later use it when building up the actual UI by attaching it at that time.  This is what we want.p  pThe issue with just changing the type to codeBindingcode is now the original XAML where you set the property to Hello World fails because it cant create a binding from that stringp  pThat leaves us with the wonky solution of using two properties... one for nonbindings, and one for bindings...p  precodepublic class MyClass      public object Content get set      public Binding ContentBinding get set   codepre  p...which works, but now there are two properties where we really just want one. After all, when binding to the Text property of a codeTextBoxcode, you dont set TextBinding You just set codeTextcode  Thats the model were trying to match.p  pThe issue is it looks like the XAML parser inspects the type of the property thats being set on, and if its anything but codeBindingcode even if its codeobjectcode, it attempts to evaluate it right then.

Negative 607 pI am running Cygwin on a Windows 7 machine, and using script files to execute Java programs in batch.

Negative 607 pHello I made a function that will return posts based on when they were created and ranked by the number of votes they have.  This is for a feed.  Im not sure that if this is an efficient way to do this and its important that I get it right because this could potentially be sifting through thousands of posts.  I have simplified it some here and briefly explained each step.  My current concerns and a post of the whole function without annotations are after.p  pThe start hours argument is for how many hours ago to get posts.  For example, if startHours6, than only posts created after six hours ago will be returned.p  precodedef rankrequest, startHours  codepre  pFirst I order all of the posts by votesp  precode    unorderedPostsPost.objects.orderbyvotes codepre  pThen posts are excluded by categories the user has specifiedp  precode    if request.user.isauthenticated          preferencesrequest.user.categorypreferenceset.filteronFalse         for preference in preferences                 unorderedPostsunorderedPosts.excludecategorynamepreference.categoryname codepre  pThen I make endHours, which is always 4 hours ahead of startHours argumentp  precode    endHoursstartHours4         4 hour time window codepre  pNow I slice the unorderedPosts and get only the ones created in the time window startHours to endHours from now.  For example, if startHours4, than only posts created after 4 hours ago but before 8 hours ago will be returned.p  precode    postsunorderedPosts.filtercreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursendHours      postsposts.excludecreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursstartHours codepre  pNow I make a loop that will move the time window back until at least one post is found that has a creation date that fits the time window.  I make the check variable to prevent an infinite loop the loop will quit if no posts are found within 200 hours.p  precode    countposts.count     checkendHours     while countlt1 and endHoursltcheck200         endHours4         startHours4         postsunorderedPosts.filtercreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursendHours         postsposts.excludecreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursstartHours         countposts.count         if countgt1 return posts, endHours      return posts codepre  pMy biggest concern is making a queryset of ALL the posts in the beginning.  This function is meant to return posts in small time windows, will it be unnecessarily slowed down by ranking all of the posts in the database  I know that djangopython querysets are quite efficient but wont ranking a set that contains thousands of objects be cumbersome for the purpose of this functionp  pIf this is a problem, how could I make it more efficient while keeping everything accessiblep  pHere is a post of the whole thing.p  precodedef rankrequest, startHours       unorderedPostsPost.objects.orderbyupVote      if request.user.isauthenticated          preferencesrequest.user.categorypreferenceset.filteronFalse         for preference in preferences filter by category preference                 unorderedPostsunorderedPosts.excludecategorynamepreference.categoryname       endHoursstartHours4     4 hour time window      postsunorderedPosts.filtercreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursendHours      postsposts.excludecreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursstartHours      countposts.count     checkendHours      while countlt1 and endHoursltcheck200         endHours4         startHours4         postsunorderedPosts.filtercreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursendHours         postsposts.excludecreatedgtetimezone.nowdatetime.timedeltahoursstartHours         countposts.count         if countgt1 return posts     return posts codepre

Negative 607 pWe are building an app iOS and Android. The core of the app will be a flash card interface where the user will see a question and then will need to give an appropriate answer.

This is good for a letter grade of A, average ...etc... codepre  pThe problem here is that if the user enters valid entries at first and then enters an invalid one, the compiler cant get back to the first while loop to check for the invalid entry. So I tried to swap the positions of the while loops. But this has the same effect it cant get back to the first while loop to check for valid entries after an invalid one is entered. The answer is most likely simple, but Im stuck.p

Negative 607 pLooking for advice on developing a Rails app using Postgres on multiple machines. Default sqlite3 has your development database in the app folder.  I leave my app folders in dropbox, so whether Im using my desktop at work or my laptop at home, code and development databases are synced with sqlite. Further, there are no database users in sqlite so thats another layer I dont need to worry about.p  pWith Postgres I always have problems the database doesnt exist, the user doesnt exist, etc. Postgres stores its files separate from the app, which makes it hard. So, how do you develop with Postgres across multiple machines and keep everything in syncp

Negative 607 pThese are the requirements of the questionp  pCreate a PLSQL function called codefindtotalcarmodelscode to return the total number of cars belonging to a particular model. The function should have a emsingle  IN parameter asem codemodelnamecode. You should then use an explicit cursor to count the  number of cars belonging to that car model and return the final count. You must strongNOTstrong  use any implicit cursors, table joins, subqueries, set operators, group functions or SQL  functions such as COUNT to create this function.p  pNow, write ONE PLSQL anonymous block that provides a report about car details.

Negative 607 pHeres my situation I have a website built with CakePHP and MySQL. My website has a public forum where members can post code samples. Some of these code samples are going to include PHP and MySQL code.p  pI understand that this is probably a dangerous thing to allow, but for one Only members whom I have specifically approved may post, and two I believe CakePHP already uses parameterized queries... and while Im sure there are still other risks involved, that is not what my question is concerned with.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pIn my local testing environment, I can submit posts that include SQL statements and strings with php code like codeltphp phpinfo gtcode but, when running the exact same code on my production server, I cant.p  pRather than being redirected to codepostsindexcode which is what normally happens after posting, I am redirected back to the same page I was on before codepostsedit25code, for example. It seems that when I attempt to submit form data that includes illegal substrings, the submittal silently fails, and CakePHP just sends me back to where I was before. No flash messages on CakePHPs behalf.p  pstrongMy diagnosis thus farstrongp  pCakePHPs codewwwapptmplogserror.logcode shows no sign of an error after I attempt to post this data. I dont have access to any other server log files at the moment.p  pI tried removing some of the php code from my posts. I emwasem able to submit strings like codeltphp echo Hello World gtcode, but if a function like codephpinfocode was anywhere in the form data, the post would get rejected. Stuffing my SQL examples with nonbreakingspaces also made it possible for me to submit form data that included SQL statements.p  pThe MySQL user account that CakePHP uses is a little restricted. I forget exactly which actions it is allowed to perform, but I think they are just codeselect, insert, update, delete, create, dropcode, and maybe a few others.p  pHowever, I also use phpMyAdmin locally to manage the production database, and when I access it via phpMyAdmin, I am using an admin account with maximum privileges. And when I manually change data through phpMyAdmin, strings like codephpinfocode in my code examples emdontem get rejectedp  pEven though this seemed like a small glimmer of hope, I have tested my site with CakePHP setup to use the MySQL admin user with max privileges, but I still cant submit my unsafe strings via the userfacing form.p  hr  pstrongMy unsatisfying conclusion thus farstrongp  pSince the exact same php code behaves differently depending on my environment, I suspect this has something do with my PHP version, MySQL version, or some security measure my sysadmin has put in place.p  pMy sysadmin is rather hard to get in touch with though, so Im trying to figure what might be causing the problem on my own.p  h2strongMy questionstrongh2  pWhat might my problem be Is there a PHP setting that prohibits unsafe strings, or some other commonlyknown setting that I could request my sysadmin to change Or perhaps might this be a MySQL setting Hard to tell given my phpMyAdmins strange ability to do things that Cake cant.

After successfully saving settings wordpress tries to redirect back to the settings page, however somehow that redirect changes the domain, instead of redirecting back to a hrefhttpxnsandraeiaki8db.com relnofollowhttpxnsandraeiaki8db.coma it redirects to a hrefhttpxnsandraeiakibra36d.com relnofollowhttpxnsandraeiakibra36d.comap  pThe only clue I got is that, a hrefhttpxnsandraeiakibra36d.com relnofollowhttpxnsandraeiakibra36d.coma is the punycode representation of httpsandraeiaki.com, so it seems like wordpress is using an invalid encoding here instead of UTF8 for redirecting back to the settings page.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI can see in wordpress options.php file that it tries to redirect using, after succesfully saving changesp  precode  Redirect back to the settings page that was submitted  goback  addqueryarg settingsupdated, true,  wpgetreferer  wpredirect goback  exit codepre  pstrongUpdate 2strong After a chat session with strongsoulseekahstrong we have traced back the issue to be in the location value set by IIS on Azure, creating a simple php page, that changes the location header, the redirection failsp  pcodeltphp header Location   exit gtcodep  pExamining the location header value, shows that it is encoded in ASCII instead of UTF8p  blockquote   pLocation sandraeiaki.comp blockquote  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pAfter some testing it only happens when the header php function is passed a relative location url value, setting the location value to an absolute uri resolves without problems , either by using the punycode domain encoding or utf8 encoding. p  pI made a temporaly fix by changing wordpress redirect function, now it sets only absolute uris, and seems to be working.p  pHowever, how I can fix that behaviour permanentlyp

I would appreciate any hint into the right direction, or even a solution for this problem.p  p[strongEditstrong] The derived solver classes need more than only the information from the xml file to work properly. That means, that I have to set some more properties which come from a mesh file. So I could give the meshfile to the IOService, so that the IOService could set the appropriate members this wayp  precodeclass IOService      BaseSolver getSolverMeshType myMesh              stdstring variableThatIReadFromXML           here I have to perform many actions before I can create a solver object           to retrieve the data needed for the constructors           TypeA variableIConstrucedWithDataFromXML         TypeB anotherVariableIConstrucedWithDataFromXML          if variableThatIReadFromXML  a                      auto solverA  new SolverAvariableIConstrucedWithDataFromXML  I know that this can leak memory             solverA.a  mesh.a                  else if variableThatIReadFromXML  b                      auto solverB  new SolverBanotherVariableIConstrucedWithDataFromXML             solverB.b  mesh.b                codepre  pBut then the IOService needs to know the class codeMeshTypecode, what I want to avoid, because I think that it breaks encapsulation. So I wanted to set the member codeacode and codebcode, respectively, in another part of my program here for simplicity in the main.p  pTaking this into account, only the answer from Daniel Daranas seems like a solution for me.

When the user selects yes then the particular record should be cancelled. p  pNow the issue is, when the user selects yes then i need to the get the index of the row for which the cancel button is clicked and i need to remove it from the list object that is used to bind the grid and rebind the gridview .p  pplease let me know how to achieve this.p  pThanks for all the reply.. im using custom pop up instead of built in confirm method.

Here is how I try to do that  I defined the tapGestureRecognizer like this p  precodeinterface GroupMasterViewController  ltSWRevealViewControllerDelegategt  property NSMutableArray groups property nonatomic, strong UITapGestureRecognizer tapGestureRecognizer  end codepre  pIn my ViewDidLoad method I have this p  precodeself.tapGestureRecognizer  [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself.revealViewController actionselectorrightRevealToggle] [self.view addGestureRecognizerself.tapGestureRecognizer] self.tapGestureRecognizer.enabled  NO codepre  pAnd in the delegate method which gets fired when the menu opens or closes p  precode voidrevealControllerSWRevealViewController revealController willMoveToPositionFrontViewPositionposition      if position  FrontViewPositionLeftSide          self.tapGestureRecognizer.enabled  YES         self.view.userInteractionEnabled  NO         self.tabBarController.tabBar.userInteractionEnabled  NO          else if position  FrontViewPositionLeft         self.tapGestureRecognizer.enabled  NO         self.view.userInteractionEnabled  YES         self.tabBarController.tabBar.userInteractionEnabled  YES        codepre  pThe Problem is that the tapGestureRecognizer does not work anymore if I disable the user interaction. p  pThank you in advance for any help. p
Negative 607 pI am new to Laravel and am working on an application that uses data provided from an external source which comes in more than forty separate databases. I have to select which database will be queried at run time based on a number of form fields. p  pI can get this to work by creating multiple connections in database.php and then using a switch statement in the controller to select the database, so it looks something likep  precodecase 1  datarows  DBconnectionmysqlxa01gttableclientdata    gtselectcolumn1, column2, column3, column4    gtwherecolumn5, LIKE, MN57XX    gtget    break  case 2  datarows  DBconnectionmysqlxa02gttableclientdata    gtselectcolumn1, column2, column3, column4    gtwherecolumn5, LIKE, MN57XX    gtget    break codepre  pand so on.  I have simplified the names of the columns and the query as thats not really relevant to the question.p  pThe issue is that I have a switch statement with more than forty case statements that are identical except for the database connection name. p  pIt is possible to generate the name of the required database from the submitted form data as the names follow a predictable sequence and it would seem to be much cleaner if I could pass the name of the database to the DBconnection using a variable, so it would look something likep  precode datarows  DBconnectionselecteddatabasegttableclientdata    gtselectcolumn1, column2, column3, column4    gtwherecolumn5, LIKE, MN57XX    gtget    break codepre  pThis would remove the need for the switch statement altogether.  p  pWhen I try to do this what happens is that the query returns no errors but the datarows object is empty. Im not sure if what I want to do is possible and maybe I have to stay with the long switch statement which does work as required, but it feels like it should be possible to do something like what I want.  I just cant figure it out and any guidance would be very helpful.p

Negative 607 pI have a UIScrollView which holds a custom drawing view. The drawing view is used to draw a large content 10000x10000 pixels. Since I cannot embed huge view inside scrollview [due memory limitations], I have created a custom view which is almost twice the size of the scrollView. I have used the StreetScroller [apple sample] logic to implement the same. This works fine but there is a problem with identifying touches. You can download the updated sample from here a hrefhttpsgithub.compraveencastelinoSampleAppstreemasterStreetScroller relnofollowhttpsgithub.compraveencastelinoSampleAppstreemasterStreetScrollerap  pSince the contentOffset of scrollview is reset to center whenever it moves X amount of pixels from its center. Hence, the scrollView content offset is different from what we actually need.

Negative 607 pIm trying to find the proper way to configure an application using Desired State Configuration. p  pFor example, Microsoft Deployment Agent. The installation is easy using the codePackagecode resource. When you run it for the first time it prompts you for user information and a URL. This is where I need help I want to add these settings to my DSC script.p  pI can tell that the information is saved in the registry, so it would be possible to use a codeRegistrycode resource, but that seems fragile. And even then, the password is not saved in that location. p  pIs there a better way to do this I feel like I am on the right track, but at the same time figuring out where applications store their settings seems very tedious and hard to get right.p
Negative 607 pWhats the industry standard for building an interactive dropdown navigation menu p  pGoogle tells me it emcanem be done in all sorts of ways. As a student working on my first major web project, Im wondering if theres a method thats standard practice. Id rather not reinvent the wheel, but Im also not confident picking and trusting one of the hundreds of guides out there, knowing that it could be outdated or bad practice. p  pIf there emis in factem no standard way of doing it and no bestpractice guidelines, let me know and Ill delete the question.p
Negative 607 pI already asked a similar question on emProgrammersem, but did not receive a good answer.p  pBelow is a quotation from the book strongWPF4 Unleashedstrongp  blockquote   pPlain text can often be used as the child of an object element, as in the       following XAML declaration of codeSolidColorBrushcodep      pcodeltSolidColorBrushgtWhiteltSolidColorBrushgtcodep      pThis is equivalent to the followingp      pcodeltSolidColorBrush ColorWhitegtcodep      peven though codeColorcode has not been designated as a content property. In this case,       the first XAML snippet works because a type converter exists that can convert       strings such as White or white or FFFFFF into a codeSolidColorBrushcode object.p blockquote  pIf I understand correctly, codeltSolidColorBrushgtWhiteltSolidColorBrushgtcode instantiates a single codeSolidColorBrushcode object thanks to the type converter. But how is the string codeWhitecode used How does XAML know which property should get that value What if there is another property of the same type as codeColorcodep  pIts important to note that codeSolidColorBrushcode does not specify any content property.p

Negative 607 pNormally, when you create a project through Xcode, you receive the option of having Xcode place the project under version control.p  pWith cocos2dx, one creates a project by using the createproject.py tool, which basically created a number of folders for each platform iOS, OSX, Android, WP8 etc. When you open the xcodeproj in the iOS folder, everything works fine in Xcode. But I cant get it to work after adding to version control. Here is what I didp  pAll these folders are placed under a root folder, which is the name of your project lets call it stanlyp  precodestanly     gtClasses     gt proj.ios     gt proj.mac     gt proj.android     .....     gtresources codepre  pEach of the above proj.  pHere is what I triedp  pI opened a terminal under stanley, and ran the following commandsp  precodegit init git add . git commit m Initial commit codepre  pIt appears that all the files in every subfolder has been added to version control.p  pIn Xcode, I then went to source controlConnect to repository , and pointed to the folder where I init the repository. I am asked which xcodeproj file to open, and a directory to use. I select iOS , and choose a new directory not the one which the python script createdp  pThe problem is, createproject.py, creates some kind of reference to cocos2dx in the xcodeproj file, but does not actually store the files in the same project directory It is intact pointing at the cocos2dx project in the folder two folders above where stanley was created. So when you open the project through the repository, the cocos2dx xcodeproj file appears as missing and the project wont compile. This problem is not there if you open the proj.ios xcodeproj file directly not by connecting to the repository through xcode.p  pHow do I fix this p  pEDIT  If I change the path to where the file is actually stored, the cocos2dx xcodeproj file is no longer missing, but other similar errors show up.p  pstrongSo what is the correct way, to create a cocos2dx project with createproject.py, place it under version control, and be able to add  commit  revert etc from the xcode guystrongp

Negative 607 pHoping someone can help me here because Im losing the will to live with this memory issue. When I push a particular view controller, Instruments shows a growth of around 3MB with the majority coming from CALayer objects belonging to each control I have on the view controller mostly textfields and labels. When I pop this view controller these CALayer allocations remain in memory, in fact every time I push and pop the controller I get a growth of 3MB each time.p  pSo my question is how do I remove these from memory, is there something I need to be doing when deallocating the controller  The only reference in my code to the controls layer is to create rounded corners and a border width layer.cornerRadius  10 but I still get the growth even when I comment this out. The controller contains a tableview where each cell contains 3 textfields, 2 buttons and an imageview which are created programatically.p  precodeUIButton formatButtonUIButtonbutton  button.layer.cornerRadius  10 button.clipsToBounds  YES button.layer.borderColor[[UIColor lightGrayColor] CGColor] button.layer.borderWidth1.0 [button.titleLabel setTextAlignmentNSTextAlignmentCenter] [button.titleLabel setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelveticaNeueUltraLight size20]] [button setTitle0 forStateUIControlStateNormal] [button setTitleColor[UIColor blackColor] forStateUIControlStateNormal]  return button   UITextFieldformatTextFieldUITextFieldtextField  [textField setFont[UIFont fontWithNameHelveticaNeueUltraLight size20]] textField.backgroundColor[UIColor whiteColor] textField.layer.borderColor[[UIColor lightGrayColor] CGColor] textField.layer.cornerRadius  10 textField.layer.borderWidth1.0 [textField setTextAlignmentNSTextAlignmentCenter] textField.clipsToBoundsYES textField.text textField.enabledNO  return textField    UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierItemCellID forIndexPathindexPath]  Configure the cell...

Negative 607 pUsing F in Visual Studio, I find myself having to explicitly annotate types a lot more that I would like, or should have to.  I am aware of some techniques for resolving this, in particular the use of the excellent forward piping operator.   However, in many circumstances I am unable to avoid doing so, and some of them seem just plain wrong.p  pFor example, I have F code like the following snippetp  precode    let b  new pqBoardthis     let b2,steps  b.Solve     if b2.Solved then          let cont  steps gt List.exists fun s  string gt s.IndexOfContradiction gt 0  codepre  pThe third line generates an error message suggesting a type annotation is required for the first of the pair returned from the call to the Solve method on the previous line.  But the second element of the pair a list of strings is fine, and requires no such annotation.  How is it that the type checker can seemingly be certain of the type of the second of the pair, but not of the first when the are returned from a single callp  pChanging the second line as follows fixes the problemp  precodelet b2  pqBoard,steps  b.Solve codepre  pWhy must I explicitly type the first element and not the secondp  pFurthermore, in this case and many others, inferred types are correctly displayed by VS in the tooltips.

I searched a lot on the internet but I only found the setprecision function for streams.p  pI cant do that because I dont want to print it but i want to write it to a file with only 2 decimals. So I have to first convert the float number to the same number but with only 2 decimals, then i put it into a string that already contain other characters. And then I write that string to the output file.p  pI found in the description of the ofstream a method precision, but I dont think it could work for what Im trying to do. a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencefstreamofstream relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencefstreamofstreama p  pDoes anyone know a function who does that or a manner for doing thatp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 607 pI am using vimrplugin to send commands from vim to a running R session and get back info about object list and autocompletions.p  pMy aim is to get communication between local vim and remote session of R. I manged to send commands to R with screen.vim plugin. However this type of communication was oneway only.p  pFor a while I thought that this is not really possible or at least not very easy to achieve however I discovered one site a hrefhttpmanuals.bioinformatics.ucr.eduhomeprogramminginrvimr relnofollowhttpmanuals.bioinformatics.ucr.eduhomeprogramminginrvimrap  pThe author there mentions accessing remote R sessions from local vim multiple timesp  blockquote   pFlexible code sending options from local vim instances to R sessions on remote machines or among remote machines.p      pThe vim session can run on a local computer, while the R session can run on the same or a remote system.p blockquote  pHowever nowhere on that site is there any description telling how to achieve this exactly.p  pI also asked the same question directly on the gouglegroup of vimrplugin, and the author replied with an option to run everything remotely a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicvimrplugin293VyyQntZ0 relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicvimrplugin293VyyQntZ0a . I managed to do that, but its not what I am after and I didnt want to bother him any further.p  pSo my question is it possible If not directly  maybe there are workarounds of not having to duplicate my vim configuration on all the remote servers I am usingp

Negative 607 pI have just started learning Stata and Im having a hard time.  My problem is this I have two different variables, codeATCcode and codeAcode, where codeAcode is potentially a substring of codeATCcode. Now I want to mark all the observations in which codeAcode is a substring of codeATCcode with codeOK  1code. p  pI tried this using a simple nested loopp  precodeforeach x in ATC  foreach j in A          replace OK  1 if strposx,j0       codepre  pHowever, whenever I run this loop no changes are being made even though there should be plenty.  I feel like I should probably give an index specifying which codeOKcode is being changed the one belonging to the codeATCcodex, but I have no idea how to do this. This is probably really simple but Ive been struggling with it for some time. p  hr  pI should have clarified my codeAcode list is separate from the main list simply appended to it and only contains unique keys which I use to identify the codeATCcodes which I want. So I have 120 codeAcodekeys and a couple million codeATCcode keys. What I wanted to do was iterate over every codeATCcode key for every single codeAcodekey and mark those codeATCcodekeys with codeAcode that qualify.p  pThat means I dont have complete tuples of codeATCcode,codeAcode,codeOKcode but instead separate lists of different sizes. For example I have p  precodeATC    OK  A  ABCD   0   . EFGH   0   . ...   ...  ... .     .    AB .     .    ET codepre  pand want the result that codeABCDcode having codeOKcode is marked as code1code while codeEFGHcode remains at code0code.p

Negative 607 pThis is under Android KitkatLollipop with multiple account feature enabled. I created a service with the user id system, and had an activity binding to the service. Then in different user account, I tried to have another activity binding to the same service with the flag Context.BINDAUTOCREATE.

I doubt how to implement the server.

My opinion that on multicore CPU the option 3 may give more efficiency. Am I correctp

Negative 607 pWhat is the performance impact of including secondary indexes 2i in an object written to Riakp  pLets consider two scenarios, both with a large number of objects within one bucket. Each object has a secondary index, lets call it codeexamplebincode but it could be an integer index as wellp  ol liAlmost each value of codeexamplebincode is a different value. A query for one specific value of the index returns only one, or just a few objects. Such index could be an email address or the registration time as a unix timestamp.li liThere is only several possible values of codeexampleintcode index. Therefore, the query for a specific index value returns huge number of objects. Such index could represent a category of users, such as administrators or customers.li ol  pWhat is the performance impact when updating these objects I understand the index needs to be checked every time the object is updated. Can either of the examples above comprise a time or resourceconsuming task for Riakp

I am doing this with CSS media queries and it works quite ok.p  pI also have a slideToggle function that should showhide the HTML content for page width less then 500px based on user demand.p  pThe problem is the following  for page width less than 500px, if the content is shown and then hidden again via slideToggle and the user resizes the screen at width larger than 500px, the HTML content is not shown again.p  pI assume the CSS rule in the slideToggle function overrides the CSS media rule and the content remains hidden. And I need to fix this.p  pThe current code is provided here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpazzescoz2xuu617 relnofollowJSFIDDLEap  pNow the first solution that I thought of An additional jquery function can be added to check screen width and display the HTML content for page width larger than 500px. Problem with this code is that once the function triggers the content remains visible even for page width less than 500px. The code is below, I havent added in the JSFIDDLE on purposep  precodevar filtermshow      jQuery.noConflict  filtermshowwindow.onresize, function      var win  filtermshowthis this  window     if win.width gt 500           filtermshow.mobhide.css         display block,                               codepre  pIS there a way to make the HTML content hidden again for width less that 500px, either via jQuery or CSS and in the same time keep the slideToggle functionality Any eedback will be appreciatedp

get used, everything seems to stop at the upload method in the JSP page, when it tries to call uploader.uploadAll method, thats where the error gets thrown. And it looks like it complains about the vars parameter, it tries to pass to uploadAll, but I have no idea what does the error mean and if theres any way to fix it. If anyone here knows anything about YUI uploader, I could use some help or at least some advise on how to debug this. p

Negative 607 pI have a windows application where I have a date that when it is changed there is a lot of other things going on or have to be confirmed. So my goal is to have a wizard popup when they select the date to walk the user through the process. I dont want them to be able to change the date on the main form at all. Ill update it through the wizard.p  pCurrently Im calling the wizard on codeEntercode of the codeDateTimePickercode. Im open to changing that if there is a better option but they have to actually select the field not just hover over it. The problem I have is that when the wizard closes, the focuscursor is still sitting in the date field where the user could potentially change the date. I know I can check the codeKeyPresscode or on codeMouseDowncode to relaunch the wizard, but what I would RATHER do is just move the cursor to another control. p  pI tried codeNewControl.Focuscode and this appears to work, however there are 2 problems with it. p  ol liAccording to MSDN, I should not be trying to change the focus with an Enter event. If COULD cause the application or OS to stop responding. li liWhen I cancel the wizard it Enters the control a second time triggering the popup and when it is cancelled a second time it leaves the calendar open or part of the date highlighted depending on who the user entered the field.li ol  pIm open to all suggestions for a better way to do this. p

Negative 607 pI made the switch to Ubuntu a couple of months ago and still do not have very much experience with unix and fish aside from the basicoften used commands. For a C class that I am taking I constantly need to SSH onto a remote linux machine run by my university called Zeus. The command to ssh onto it is a bit lengthy, and I would like to be able to make the process faster with a fish script.p  pI wrote a file called zeus.fish that essentially just calls my ssh command, among a few other things. Currently I can only run it by calling fish zeus.fish within the directory of the file. I would like to be able to run the script from within any directory, just like any other command. IE just typing zeus would attempt to log me into the remote machine. Im assuming that I have to do something with PATH. How can I do this Thanksp
