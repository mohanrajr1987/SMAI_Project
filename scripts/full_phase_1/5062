Positive 5062 pI am creating a clone of the header and when the scroll reach a certain height, the clone version will display.  This works, as I want. The problem is that I am trying to get the hamburger action to work in both headers. Now it only works in first section. I need to get it working in section two also. I know I have used an ID triggeroverlay, which should only be used one time and be unique. p  pIs this correct and the reason why it is not working Do you guys know a workaround to fix this problem p  pI need it to be an ID because of a more complex code in another script, but if its not possible to keep it I will do it in another way.

Positive 5062 pIm a C programmer turning my hand to a C project in VS 2008. I have the source of a program delivered by an outside company for which I wish to make a DLL providing some of the functionality to be used by a C program we build around it.p  pI have a C project which contains all of the code for the external companys program. All of the functionality I want is implemented in a single header file of about 15 but when I codeincludecode that in a separate project, I get a stronglotstrong of compiler syntax errors from libraries and header files included as part of other header files or one of the two .cpp files. p  pIve tried going through and just including everything wantonly from the original project just to get it to build but I still get fewer syntax errors. The original project builds just fine. p  pIm unaccustomed to dealing with this sort of situation and I dont have the vocabulary to describe my problem well enough for Google to help. Are there any tools or techniques used by C programmers to work through the web of dependencies like this in order to transplant the required dependencies from one project to anotherp  pEditp  pAn example of the specific problems Im seeing include p  precodeerror C2143 syntax error  missing  before lt codepre  pon the second of these two linesp  precodestatic int VLBNO static vectorltintgt VLBNOLIST codepre  pwhich is solved by adding  codeinclude ltvectorgtcode.p  pAnother specific example is p  precodeerror C2065 Dialogue  undeclared identifier codepre  pon the linep  precodeDialogue MADialogueMFpath codepre  pwhich is solved by adding codeinclude ..databaseDialogue.hcode which implements the Dialogue class. This leaves me with another 183 errors which I believe would be solved by also codeincludecode ing the correct header files.p  pIm not asking for help with a specific dependency or compiler error, Im asking if there are any programming techniques I may be unaware of which will help me identify what header and library dependencies a project has, so that I can then codeincludecode the required files in another project.p  pWhat techniques do C programmers use to unravel dependency issues which I might not be aware of as someone more accustomed to Cp

Positive 5062 pIm in the process of learning C for a coursework assignment. One thing that confuses me is header files. Ive tried to find some information regarding my question to no avail.p  pMy question is, say I have 3 different .c files. The convention is atleast from reading sources  each .c file has its own .h file, e.g. parser.c has parser.h, lexer.c has lexer.h, typechecker.c has typechecker.h if we were making a compiler. p  pWe then go on to add a statement p  precodeinclude parser.h include typechecker.h  codepre  pin the lexer.c file, and do the same with the other .c files changing the header files we include.p  pInstead of using that convention, is it okay to add all the prototypes for all 3 sclassess files into one header, say header.h, and just include that in all 3 sclassess The problem with this is that the 3 classes will have prototypes of functions already included in this class, but I dont see this as a problem Im a beginner at C so I could be wrong.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5062 pIll try to keep this example as simple as I can. Im trying to implement a domaindriven design a business object to represent each table in an old VB6 app which follows no OOP patterns.  The existing code is written just as you might expect from a 10 year old VB app i.e. use of ADODB.Recordset with no intellisense for fields. The existing code is nonOOP and I cringe at following its existing patterns. One of my challenges here is how to handle database changes as new requirements come up, without creating too much confusion to any developers who may look at the DB design later.p  pSuppose in this app we have a hypothetical Client table that is clearly overburdened as such clientId ClientName ContactName Address City State Zip Phone CreditLimit CurBalance and on and on and on...p  pA new requirement calls for new financial fields InterestRate  Terms p  pWould it be acceptable to break InterestRate and Terms into a separate Fiancials table, which may appear as a weird split since the existing 2 financial fields will exist in the original tablep  pIdeally the old financial fields CreditLimit, CurBalance would be relocated to this new table, but at the risk of breaking MANY parts of the app, it is not desirable to move fields.  I just want to stop the current practice of making a table wider and wider.p  pBasically, I am thinking I want to leave old codetable design alone, make a clean break with new fields, and create domain objects to handle any existing and new tables i.e. Client object could expose a Financials property representing the new Financials table.p  pIs it a good idea to TRY to make a clean break or just add new fields to the existing muck Is there a clever naming scheme for representing new tables versus the old How do you DBAs make a clean break without ripping apart the existing designp  pthanks for any thoughtsp

Assuming R is around 10 times larger than S  C, wont benefits from spreading the work of a request across multiple cores be minimal since each core is processing around 10 requests alreadyp  pIf Im correct why does a hrefhttpjacobian.orgwritingsnakesontheweb relnofollowthis guya say concurrency is so important to the future of Python as a language for web developmentp  pI can see many reasons why my argument would be incorrect.  Perhaps the application receives a few verydifficulttoprocess requests that are outnumbered by available cores.  Or perhaps there is a large variation in the difficulty of requests, so its possible for one core to be unlucky and be given 10 consecutive difficult requests, with the result being that some of them take much longer than is reasonable.  Given that the guy who wrote the above essay is so much more experienced than I am, I think theres a significant chance Im wrong about this, but Id like to know why.p

Negative 5062 pI have a question regarding DDD and the repository pattern. p  pSay I have a Customer repository for the Customer aggregate root. The Get amp Find methods return the fully populated aggregate, which includes objects like Address, etc. All good. But when the user is searching for a customer in the UI, I just require a summary of the aggregate  just a flat object with summarised information. p  pOne way I could deal with this is to call the find method on the repository as normal, and then in the application layer, map each customer aggregate to a CustomerSearchResult  CustomerInfo DTO, and send them back to the client. p  pBut my problem with this is performance each Customer aggregate may require multiple queries to populate all of the associations. So if my search criteria matched 50 customers, thats quite a hit on the DB for potentially retrieving data Im not even going to need.p  pThe other issue is that I may wish to include summarised data about the customer that is outside of the Customers aggregate root boundary, such as the date of the last order made for example. Order has its own aggregate and therefore to get the customers order information I would have to call the OrderRepository, also degrading performance.p  pSo now I think Im left with two optionsp  ol lipAdd an additional Find method to the CustomerRepository which returns a list of these summary objects by doing one efficient query.pli lipCreate a purpose built readonly CustomerInfoRepository, that just has the find method described in 1.pli ol  pBut both of these feel like Im going against the principles of DDD. My repositories inherit from a generic base Repository where T  IAggregateRoot. These summary info object are not an aggregates, and are of a different type to T, so really 1 goes against the design. p  pPerhaps for 2 I would create an abstract SearchRepository without the IAggregateRoot constraintp  pThere are many similar scenarios in my domain. p  pHow would you implement this scenario p  pThanks,  Davep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter reading Theos answer, I think I will go with option 2 and create a specialised SearchRepository within my infrastructure geared towards these scenarios.

Negative 5062 pI get a problem with SQL Server 2005, where a stored procedure seems to randomly hanglock, and never return any result. p  pWhat the stored procedure does is to call a function, which in turn makes a union of two different functions  returning the same type of data, but from different criteria. Nothing advanced. I dont think its the functions hanging, because there are other SPROCs that call the same functions without a problem, even when the first one has locked up.p  pAfter the SPROC hangs, any further attempts to call it will result in a time out  not in the call itself, but the response time will be too great, as no result is returned the code will throw an exception.p  pIt has happened at least three times in two months in a relatively lowload system. Restarting SQL Server solves the situation, but I dont regard that as a solution to the problem.p  pIve looked for information, and found something about the query cache going corrupt. However, that was in regard to dynamic SQL strings, which my problem is not. I guess it could still be the query cache.p  pHas anyone had the same problem, and if so, what did you do about it dont say restart SQL Server every morning   Is there any way of debugging the issue to try and find exactly what and where things go wrong I cant recreate the problem, but when it appears again it would be good if I knew where to take a closer look.p  pI dont think it makes any difference, but just for the record, the SPROC is called from .NET 3.5 code, using the Entity Franework. I say it doesnt make a difference, because when Ive tested to just execute the SPROC directly from SQL Server Management Studio, no result is returned either.p
Negative 5062 pIve got a .NET Web Service Reference to a 3rd party WSDL.p  pIn that reference are 2 classes.  Basically these 2 classes are most likely Interfaces on the 3rd Party API side but in .NET end up as 2 proxy classes.p  pI have a need to combine both these classes into one class.  Why  Because its stupid that these are split, theyre the service which allows me to make method calls.  The method calls are all split half and half between these 2 proxy classes.p  pSo I want to create a custom wrapper class called ThirdPartyService and somehow essentially inherit both those proxy classs members.  I know you can inherit 2 classes in C but I dont see how to do this with an interface either.p

Negative 5062 pI have some old C plugin code that was implemented strictly with Reflection.  In fixing some C 2.0  4.0 compatibility issues a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combshawnfaarchive20090608moreimplicitusesofcaspolicyloadfromremotesources.aspx relnofollowLoad from Remote Sourcea Ive decided to get rid of the old reflection code and replace it with an interface.  The interface is needed because the Plugins now need to be loaded into their own AppDomain and then marshalled across.p  pI can go through the source for hundreds of plugins and simply make them all implement the new codeIPlugincode interface with a simple searchandreplace.  This works nicely except in strongonestrong crucial place.  emAnd Im looking for an easy out.emp  pThe method codeRunPlugincode can be implemented in one of two ways, but never both  Either with an argument or without.  If I include this in the interface, Id have to implement both in each of the plugins.  The caller calls the one or no argument method based on emwhich one is implementedem.  The calling assembly figures this out now by reflection.p  pTo avoid that I can create a wrapper class for the plugins, that wrapper implements the interface, but then Id have to heavily edit each of the plugins to include an override for each of the APIs many methods.p  pSome sample code this doesnt necessarily work  Its all in transition right nowp  pThe interface samplep  precode In IPlugin.cs  IPlugin.dll namespace Plugin      public interface IPlugin                  Many, many happy API things like this...            void SetupOptionsHashtable options             examples elided              And then these two... either one or the other             is implemented, but not both.

Negative 5062 pI am working on a company running several internet shops. We are about completely rewrite the whole code site content and products management, order processing, partner relations, accounting, customer base and other. Currently we have a system, where all the stuff all internal management sites, businesslogic and internet store web sites is tightly coupled running on a single LAMP instance, and absolutely all data is located in a literally single garbage database. Because of this and also because of 10 years development, partially rewritten from perl, php code quality introducing new webstore, redesigning any existing or changing anything in logic is kind of impossible task.p  pIn order to not only rewrite old  code but also optimize system architecture, I am surely decide to separate web sites each other from, decouple business cores from web sites and business cores each other from.p  pFrom one point all web shops mostly sells the one common product base, they are kind of the mirrors, sometimes just designed differently to target international customers titles and descriptions may vary. Stuff we sell is a service product that depends on local partners but with common predefined product range. But in several cities we have special prices, in others cities we offer enhanced product range in addition to common range. So we also run dedicated websites focused on a single city, websites that sells special offers only and so on.p  pIn contrast to solution where each web site have their own product database that sometimes is copy of another I am considering to compose all the products descriptive information, availability in different cities andor different sites and prices into a single isolated product management system and serve all the info thru SOAP. And every time any user will visit any site, site will consume that service providing some parameters and then list the products. Apparently common access library can be developed to include it to every site.p  p1 Is that solution adequate Will it perform fast enough without caching We have limited resources 1.5 developer so I am trying to not introduce when possible additional technical complexities like requirement to use memcached on every site.p  p2 Suppose, I reconstruct the system in a decoupled manner. Will the benefit be adequate to engage myself in all the work with memcached etc.p  p3 It is reasonable to cache data on SOAP server side, but not in website and continue make thousands of soap requestp  pAll systems will be decoupled, some the website related of them is for example order processing, customer authorization common accross all websites, payment receiving integration and etc. In case of order processing when order is need to be placed website remotely put it in order processing system thru SOAP, and then in turn expose their own SOAP server to receive order status updates. p  p4 Is that decoupling SOAP centric philosophy rightp  pTechnologies to use are nginx, php, MySQLp

Negative 5062 pGiven the following code from a Microsoft examplep  precodepublic class EngineMeasurementCollection  CollectionltEngineMeasurementgt      public EngineMeasurementCollection              Addnew EngineMeasurement  Speed  1000, Torque  100, Power  20          Addnew EngineMeasurement  Speed  2000, Torque  160, Power  60          Addnew EngineMeasurement  Speed  3000, Torque  210, Power  125          Addnew EngineMeasurement  Speed  4000, Torque  220, Power  160          Addnew EngineMeasurement  Speed  5000, Torque  215, Power  205          Addnew EngineMeasurement  Speed  6000, Torque  200, Power  225          Addnew EngineMeasurement  Speed  7000, Torque  170, Power  200        public class EngineMeasurement      public int Speed  get set      public int Torque  get set      public int Power  get set   codepre  pHow do I get the minimummaximum of Speed or Torque or Power.  I need this to set the scale on a chart Im doing WPF Toolkit Chart to be precise. I suppose I could have a method inside EngineMeasurementCollection that iterates through each EngineMeasurement and looks at Power or Speed, but I suspect there is a much easier way  The class Collection does have some sort of Min method, but note, Im not trying to get the minimum of the collection Im not sure what that would mean in this case but rather, the minimum of a particular property ex. Speed.  I did see the use of Collection.Min with functors.  Is there something that could be done there  Or with Linq  Im interested in all ways. Thanks, Davep  pBonus question perhaps this will be obvious to me with the answer to minmax. What are the options to decide if a value such as Speed is already in the collection.  Its not clear from this example, but it could be the case that if you already have some data for a given independent variable time for example, you dont want any more.  So is there something like Collection.Containsspecify property you are interested inp

Negative 5062 pIm refactoring a project that involves passing around a lot of arrays.  Currently, each method that returns an array sorts it right before returning it.  This isnt ideal for a couple reasons  theres lots of duplicated code, its inefficient to sort an array two or three times, and its too easy to write a new function but to forget to sort the array before returning it.p  pIm looking for a way to guarantee that the array always kept in alphabetical order.  My current thought is to subclass codeNSMutableArraycode andor codeNSArraycode to create an alphabetized array class.  I would need to override all of the methods that create or modify the array to call codesupercode and then sort itself.p  pDoes this sound reasonable, or is there a better approachp  pEDIT Since performance issues have been mentioned, Ill include the relevant information from my project.  Speed is not an important concern.  The whole process only takes a few seconds, and the tool is only used every so often.  So simplicity and obvious correctness is more important.p  pAlso, the use case for arrays is specific.  When an array is returned, the caller always accesses every element in the array at least once.p

Which in turn would mean I have to create a custom class that inherits codeSystem.Diagnostics.Processcode, and have a method that accepts a string argument so the codeOutputDataReceivedcode event can pass the process instance name string to my overridden codeDataReceivedEventHandlercode.p  pThe purpose of the question is to get some opinions on how to proceed.

Negative 5062 pAlright, this ones got me baffled. I have and NSCollectionViewItem subclass which was registering as an observer of a property of its parent collection view. After implementing drag and drop on the collection view, the observation no longer works. Im calling codeaddObserverforKeyPathoptionscontextcode on the parent collection view in my codeawakeFromNibcode method, but it appears that now the collection view is returning a nil value although it doesnt do this in any of the other methods that get called later. Any ideasp  pEDIT 1 Okay. Ive narrowed it down and discovered that, for whatever reason, I cant make any calls to codeself.viewcode inside of codevoidsetSelectedBOOLflagcode, which Ive overridden in my NSCollectionViewItem subclass implementation. And I mean ANY calls. This code breaks the observation patternp  precodevoidsetSelectedBOOLflag       DiscCollectionItemView  theview  DiscCollectionItemView self.view   codepre  pI still have no idea why this doesnt work.p  pEDIT 2 After reading a few things other places, it looks like overriding setSelected is generally not a good idea. I figured out a workaround using bindings instead.p

Negative 5062 pWhat is a good solution for communication via message broker that supports both CPython and JavaJMS applications  My particular requirements arep  ul liopen source solutionli liAvailable on Linuxbased systemsli liNo rendezvous between sender and receiver required i.e. uses a message brokerli liMultiple producers and consumers supported for a single event queue only one consumer receives each messageli liUnit of work support with twophase commit XA support nice to haveli liSupport for persistent messages i.e. that survive a restart of the brokerli liSupports JMS for Java clientsli liNo component is fringe, meaning at risk of falling out of maintenance due to lack of community supportinterestli liIf there is a Python client that manages to speak JMS that would be awesome, but an answer including a task to write my own Python JMS layer is acceptableli ul  pI have had a surprisingly hard time finding a solution for this.  Apaches ActiveMQ has no Python support out of the box.  ZeroMQ requires a rendezvous.  RabbitMQ does not appear to support JMS.  The best candidate I have found is a combination of ActiveMQ and the pyactivemq library.  But the first and last release of pyactivemq was in 2008, so it would appear that that fails my no fringe requirement.p  pThe ideal answer will be the names of one or more wellsupported and welldocumented open source packages, that you have personally used to communicate between a JavaJMS and Python application, and that do not require a lot of integration work to get started.  An answer that includes an easy up to a few days of work implementation of additional glue code to meet all the requirements above, would be acceptable.  A commercial solution, in the absence of a good open source candidate, would be acceptable also.p  pAlso, Jython is out.  If only I could...  The same Python applications will need to use modules only available in CPython.p

Negative 5062 pWhen working with phylogenetic tree data in R specifically when working with phylo or phylo4 objects it would be useful to normalize branch lengths so that certain taxa the ones that evolve faster do not contribute a disproportionate amount of branch length to the tree.

I need more than just UniFrac values, however.p  pHowever, I cannot find a function that performs this normalization step. I have looked in ape, picante, adephylo, and phylobase. Could someone direct me to a package that includes this function, or a package that makes writing this kind of function straightforward p
Negative 5062 pOne of my unit tests is driven by test data, stored in codesrctestresourcestestData.txtcode. Since Maven will copy the contents of codesrctestresourcescode to codetargettestclassescode which is on the classpath, I can read that file conveniently from the classpath without caring about its absolute file name. So far, so good.p  pNow Im in the process of witing some code that will update that file with data fetched from a remote system. That code will be run rarely, and not as part of the build. The updated file will be committed to the source repository. In order to append to the file, I need to know the path to the original file in codesrctestresourcescode appending to the one in codetargettestclassescode will obviously not work.p  pHow do I determine that path in a portable way Id rather not hard code codesrctestresourcescode, because those directory names may actually change. Also, this would break if executed with a current working directory other than my project base directory.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 5062 pI am using LCDS and Flex. When I am sending an object from java to Flex, I donot want to send all the properties.

But When I see the AMF logs , the object has the birthDate with value in it.br Does serialization looks into code and checks the private variable is transient. I dont understand how it has access to private property. I am little confused.br Should I mark variable as public. Then getters and setters make no sense and moreover I write some code in setter method. So I need setter. p  pQuestionsp  ol lipI read in a bookEnterprise flex with blazeds by Brain Telintelo, Chapter 15 that out of box Blazeds only serializes fileds that have matching getters and setters. If this is the case, will blazeds even bothers to check private property as transient.pli lipCan some body please explain how normal serializtion not amf serializtion  takes place and keeps track of private transient variables even though they have public getters and setters.pli lipHow do I make a java variable not serialize in FlexLCDSBlazeDS environment.  pli ol  pI have 5060 variables in objects and 4 or 5 varibales should not be seriablezed. So writing custion Serializer in such a large objects is a big pain. And another disadvantage I see is hibernate will not be able to use this object if I write my own serializer.p

Negative 5062 pIm having troubles choosing the best solution to my problems. Currently, Im working on my first C project, Im using Qt BTW, but because Im a .NET developer, there are some things that bit me concerning C .  As you all know, in a gargage collected world, such as Java or .NET, best practice is to use Dependency Injection for loose coupling classes, making it more testable and maintenable, but I have no idea what to do in C. C doesnt have a GC, so we should take care about every memory allocation and that causes too much questions.p  pFor example, I have a class Rule, which has a member field pointing to Application classp  precodeclass Rule  public QObject  public     explicit RuleQObject parent  0      unsigned int id     void setIdunsigned int id      Application application     void setApplicationApplication application              mApplication  application         mApplicationgtsetParentthis        codepre  pIn the constructor, Im assigning NULL to application instance variable. In setApplication, Im assigning this as the parent to application. Application instance will be deleted automatically when Rule the parent is destroyed, thanks to Qt. Is this a good approach would it be better if I used smart pointer such as QSharedPointer instead of Application Whats your experience, whats the drawbacks,  whats the best approach. I would gladly listen to your advices. Also there is another tricky part here. What if I gave that class to another developer in the team, or I published the library. The developer could easily write something likep  precodeApplication app app.setId1 Rule rule rule.setApplicationampapp When rule will be destroyed, the program would crash because app is allocated on the stack. codepre  porp  precodeApplication app  new Application appgtsetId20 Rule rule  new Rule rulegtsetApplicationapp Application appToAnotherLocation  new Application rulegtsetApplicationappToAnotherLocation  This wouldnt result in memory leak, because app is already child of rule, but if I didnt used Qt this would be a problem... probably  codepre  pNow what about smart pointers Is there some rules, when we should use them and when we shouldnt I have a IRepository interface, which always returns QSharedObject instead of pointers. Is this a good approach or am I overusing itp  precodeclass IRepository  public     virtual bool saveApplication amp application  0     virtual bool saveRule amp rule  0     virtual bool saveHistory amp history  0      virtual bool removeApplication amp application  0     virtual bool removeRule amp rule  0     virtual bool removeHistory amp history  0      virtual QSharedPointerltApplicationgt getApplicationunsigned int id  0      virtual QSharedPointerltRulegt getRuleunsigned int id  0     virtual QListlt QSharedPointerltRulegt gt getRulesunsigned int applicationId  0      virtual QSharedPointerltHistorygt getHistoryunsigned int id  0     virtual QListlt QSharedPointerltHistorygt gt getHistoriesunsigned int applicationId  0     virtual QListlt QSharedPointerltHistorygt gt getHistoriesunsigned int applicationId, QDateTime dateFrom, QDateTime dateTo  0  codepre  pThanks.

My problem is that I dont have or dont want all the graphics to be in high resolution but I still want everything to be the same size as before, with a few objects in HD.

Negative 5062 pIve been trying to create a Web Service with play framework. Ive searched some tutorial and resource about this and end up using the strongrenderJSONstrong method to provide JSON RESTful web service.p  pBut, there seems to be a problem with that when I try to consume the web service with JQuery. If I use strongJSONstrong, it fails with this error codeOrigin httplocalhost is not allowed by AccessControlAllowOrigincode. Which seems to be a crossdomain problem. Then I try to use strongJSONPstrong as the datatype when JQuery trying to consume the web service, again theres an parseError problem.p  pAfter some research, I found that to provide a web service to the JSONP request. We need to provide something like a callback function. So its not enough to return only the JSON object to the client.

Negative 5062 pI have a c web application where I need to dynamically generate controls, and where the actions on the controls also affect which controls will be rendered. Imagine for example a list of buttons, where each button should remove itself and its reference in the database. I have the feeling I dont understand something quite basic here at least it should bep  pI would like to use event handlers here. However, the question is then where should I generate the controls, in PageLoad or PreRender If I generate them in pageload the event handlers havent fired yet so the generated content isnt up to date yet. I can also generate it in PreRender but then the event handlers dont fire because the controls dont exist yet.p  pWhat would be the preferred way of handling this I really want to avoid the option to modify the generated content later, it is way too errorprone in my case. I would like to generate all content from scratch, right after the events have been handled. Currently I solve this partially by examining the request.form before the generation of the controls but I have quite a lot of actions and its not really a workable solution in quite some cases already.p

Negative 5062 pI am a total php beginner. I actually want to customize a survey platform for visual stimuli for my needs as I need this for my thesis. The original version of this survey platform asks participants for their mail address to login then they see the available tests. As far as I understand it the code checks if the mail address is already saved in the database and if not reserves a certain number of the stimuli for the respective participant with the use of their mail address as identifier. This number of stimuli will then be blocked from further tests.

Negative 5062 pI have a couple processes running a tool Ive written that are joined by pipes, and I would like to measure their collected memory usage with codevalgrindcode. So far, I have tried something likep  precode valgrind toolmassif tracechildrenyes peakinaccuracy0.5 pagesasheapyes massifoutfilemyProcesses.p myProcesses.script codepre  pWhere codemyProcesses.scriptcode runs the equivalent of my tool codefoocode twice, eme.g.emp  precodefoo  foo gt devnull codepre  pValgrind doesnt seem to capture the collected memory usage of this the way I expect. If I use codetopcode to track this, I get for sake of argument 10 memory usage on the first codefoocode, and then another 10 collects on the second codefoocode before the codemyProcesses.scriptcode completes. This is the sort of thing I want to measure the usage of both processes. Valgrind instead returns the following errorp  precodeMassif msmain.c1891 msnewmembrk Assertion VGISPAGEALIGNEDlen failed. codepre  pIs there a way to collect memory usage data for commands Im using in a piped fashion using codevalgrindcode Or a similar tool that I can use to accurately automate these measurements p  pThe numbers that codetopcode returns while polling seem handwavy, to me, and I am seeking accurate and repeatable measurements. If you have suggestions for alternative tools, I would welcome those, as well.p  pstrongEDITstrong  Fixed typo with codevalgrindcode option.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong  For some reason, it appears that the option codepagesasheapcode is giving us troubles with the binaries were testing. Your examples run fine.  A new page is created every time we enter a noninlined function stack overflows  heh. We wanted to count those, but theyre relatively minor in the scale of memory usage were testing. Perhaps there arent function calls in codelscode or codelesscode Removing codepagesasheapcode helped get testing working again. Thanks to MrGomez for the great help.p

How would I refer to the UI file in my source code keeping in mind that the loading of the file is not performed by creating a file object codefopen...code but rather by passing a file location as a string argument to codeUIManager.adduifromfile...codep  pIn addition to this particular situation of a UI file, how would I do similar references to files i.e. databases, INI files, XML schemas by using the autotools build process Is there a piece of relevant Automake code to quickly set up a project to use this type of directory structurep

Negative 5062 pMy goal is to create a custom codeUITableViewCellcode which contains 2 UILabels. One is the title and one is the detail. The detail label should allow for 3 rows of text.p  pSo I went on and created a custom table view cell in storyboard. I also created a subclass of codeUITableViewCellcode and linked the two together.p  pI the added two codeUILabelcode to the cell in storyboard and placed them where i wanted them to be and linked them to their coresponding outlets in teh subclass. Since the content of the labels varies I wanted to align the text vertically to the top. As I understand the only way to do this is by calling the codesizeToFitcode method on the label. I execute this under in the sub class of codeUITableViewCellcodep  precodevoidlayoutSubviews       [super layoutSubviews]      [self.detailTextLabel sizeToFit]  codepre  pSo far everything seems fine and the text in the codedetailTextLabelcode is aligned as it should. Although when i satrt interacting with the cell, for example slide my finger over it so the delete button appears, the codedetailTextLabelcode will change size to the size that was set in storyboard. This causes the text to be misaligned. Similar things happen when i select the cell and change to another view and the return to the table view via a tab barp  pMy question is Is there any way of creating this custom cell differently using storyboard or is my only alterative to create everything programticallyp  pRegard, Christianp

But how can half a node be inserted strongWhenever n is not a power of 2, you always arrive at a decimal amount of node insertions at some level  how do you deal with thisstrong p  pI considered removing a certain amount of nodes such that the remaining nodes are a power of two, building a tree out of the remaining nodes and then bubbling the removed nodes into the tree after it has been completed. But with large amounts of nodes this becomes unfeasible i.e. number of nodes  1600. The closest power of 2 is 1024, meaning you would have to bubble 576 nodes, which is relatively time consuming.p
Negative 5062 pGenerally, when you want to iterate over a portion of a list in Python, the easiest thing to do is just slice the list. p  precode Iterate over everything except the first item in a list  items  [1,2,3,4] iterrange  x for x in items[1] codepre  pBut the slice operator creates a new list, which is not even necessary to do in many cases.

Negative 5062 pTo elaborate on my question, the particular situation is thisp  pIf I have a simulation or game project with, say, a codeMonstercode class that has different statistics as member data codehitPointsRemainingcode, codeAttackDamagecode, etc and I want to have any number of different types of monsters with constant base statistics codeMaxHPcode, codeSpeedcode, etc, then I see three ways that this class will need to be usedp  ol liAn actual class with an interface to be used for using Monster objects throughout the code say, codeMonstercodeli liThe actual data for the different types of monsters. conceptually possible subclasses although Im certain thats not the right solution example Goblin, Dragon, Cyclops, etcli liActual instantiated codeMonstercode objects representing different monsters as the character meets them in the game with possibility of multiple instances of the same type at any timeli ol  pI was wondering how most designers go about implementing this. My thoughts were as followsp  pIt doesnt make sense to make a codeMonstercode class and then a new subclass for every type of monster conceived of as development progresses. This seems like a horribly messy and unmaintainable solution, especially if the number of different monster types vary in the hundreds and difference between each type isnt nearly great enough to warrant a new subclassp  pRather, my solution would be as follows 1. Have a file that can be added to containing data for all the different codeMonstercode types and their characteristics in a table. The table could be added to at any time in the development of the project.p  ol lipWrite a function to load data from the table into a codeMonstercode object.pli lipWrite an initialization call at the start of the program, possibly in some sort of codeMonsterManagercode class, to parse the file and create a static or member vector of instantiated codeMonstercode objects with all the base statistics filled in from the table in the file ie, starting hitpoints, etcpli lipWhenever I want to instantiate a new codeMonstercode of some type to add to someones army or have someone meet with, choose a codeMonstercode out of the vector randomly or via some detemining factor create a new codeMonstercode object, and copy it out of the vectorpli ol  pDoes this make sense as a solution or am I out to lunch If this is not a good solution, what better methods are therep  pOther supplemental questionsp  pWould it make sense to make a different class for the monster data that would be held in the vector I thought I could have a class called codeMonsterDatacode that would be built into a vector by the codeMonsterManagercode above. I could pass to a codeMonsterDatacode object to the constructor of the codeMonstercode class to actually create codeMonstercode objects, since a lot of codeMonstercode objects characteristics would be determined by their monstertypes MaxHP, speed, etc and other stuff would vary CurrentHP, any randomized variables, etcp  pI thought this method would be optimizable since you could do things like add an entry to the table indicating which levels the monsters show up in, and then have the codeMonsterManagercode initialization function only load all monsters from certain levels at once to shrink the memory footprint Since Im not using an codeenumcode for this, does storing a text string make sense as a means of identifying the codeMonstercode objects type Perhaps a pointer to the codeMonstercode or codeMonsterDatacode it was copied from in the codeMonsterManagercodes vector would be betterp  pI used the game analogy because it is what makes the most sense to me here, but Id like to know the best design pattern for this kind of thing in any situation.p  pThanks everyonep

For 90 of the database, I have been able to get Code First EF to work, and I am very impressed.p  pIve run into a case that I am wondering how to model or access the data through a navigation property.p  pIn one case, the tables are like this this example is totally made up, but represents the problemp  precodeCREATE TABLE Dog      id            INTEGER      PRIMARY KEY,     name          VARCHAR50  NULL,     breedid      INTEGER      NOT NULL   CREATE TABLE Breed      id               INTEGER      NOT NULL,     organizationid  INTEGER      NOT NULL,     description      VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,      Primary key id, organization   CREATE TABLE Organization      id            INTEGER      PRIMARY KEY,     description   VARCHAR100 NOT NULL  codepre  pIn Table breed, the organization represents an organization that has defined a breed. A dog can have several breeds, but the program only displays one, the results being filtered by the organization id  which is a value that is configured when the program is set up.p  pAn example of the data that might be present is thisp  precodeid    organizationID    Description  1                 1    Basset Hound  2                 1    Great Dane  2                 2    Grande Dane codepre  pWhere organization 2 has chosen to call the breed something different than organization 1.  The unique primary key is a combination of id and organizationID.  A dog has a breed, but  does not have a property to define one or more associated organizations.  It takes additional information from another table, or a configured value perhaps an enumerated value to find the breed of a dog.    p  pIn my case, to find a particular dog breed, you have to have a dog id and another piece of information organizationid which is related to program configuration.p  pThe dog, breed and organization classes look like thisp  precodepublic class Dog    public int id   get set    public string name   get set    public int breedID   get set     public virtual Breed  get set               public class Breed    public int id   get set    public int organizationID   get set                public string description   get set     public virtual Organization  get set      public class Organization    public int id   get set    public string description   get set   codepre  pAs seen in the code, Id like to use a Navigation Property on Dog that returns a breed, but dont think I can configure this in code first. p  pIve tried a few different things in fluent API, and leaving organization out  since thats easy and will also document things I dont think workp  precode1     modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasKeyt gt t.id    modelBuilder.EntityltBreedgt.HasKeyt gt t.id    modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasRequiredd gt d.Breed.WithMany.HasForeignKeyd gt d.breedID codepre  pOf course, the problem with this is that more than one breed will be returned and entity framework will throw an exception because the breedID itself is insufficient to yield a single value  which the model is calling for.p  precode2     Change class dog       Remove           public virtual Breed  get set        Add           public virtual ICollectionltBreedgt Breeds  get set             public Breed Breed              get                 Assume 1 is configured organization value               return Breeds.Singlet gt t.OrganizationId  1                          set                Breeds.Addvalue                               Change model         I dont know how to do this for the given classes.  Since its a Collection, it must look something like          modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasManyd gt d.Breeds...          but I dont see how to specify that breedID is a foriegn key into the breed table. codepre  pIf I could get the model to work, the rest will work, but it does seem wierd and inefficient.  p  precode 3     Change model to account for composite key using first set of classes        modelBuilder.EntityltBreedgt.HasKeyb gt new  b.id, b.organizationId          modelBuilder.EntityltDoggt.HasRequiredt gt t.Breed.WithMany.HasForeignKeyt gt new  t.breedID, configuredValue  codepre  pI dont know how to inject configuredValue as in the last line, so this doesnt work either.p  pIf none of the above methods work, or if I cant find another way to configure code first properly, then Id like to specify that when the Breed navigation property getter is called, it should use a query that can get the appropriate breed and return it appropriately.p  pHowever, I dont want to dirty my POCO with the Context calls to return the result of the query. In other words, Id like to have a property on Dog that does NOT look something like this p  precodepublic Breed Breed     get        return context.Breed.Whereb gt b.id  this.id ampamp b.organizationID  1.Single         codepre  pIdeally, it would work like the Navigation collections do, where EF does its magic and returns the appropriate results.p  pIntuitively, it seems like I should be able to either configure this using POCOlike code or useextend a proxy to extend the configuration to use the particular query I want when the accessor is called. Or  it seems like I ought to be able to populate the property on any read and dirty the POCO on write. Im just not familiar enough with EF to know how to do this.p  pIs this possiblep  pAs an addition to the first post, because I desire to keep my POCO classes clean, I think I will probably implement the Repository pattern to encapsulate the complex queries like the ones Ive described, as well as support other operations also.p  pLooking at the EDMX that Ive generated from my Code First model, its not apparent how to implement the model from a database first perspective, either.p  pAny thoughts are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5062 pI am trying to create a static library written in ObjectiveC.  I would like to hide all implementation details from consumers of this library.

Negative 5062 pSo Im trying to teach myself object oriented programming using VB.net, and Although I have some basic experience with it, I feel that Im doing something terribly wrong.p  pThere are two visible screens Forms to my application, a select your difficulty screen that Ill refer to as screen1, and a game screen that I will refer to as screen2.p  ol lipI create a Main class that runs when the application has loadedpli lipFrom within Main I generate screen1 and screen2 both Forms.pli lipScreen1 holds two buttons. When clicked, they will hide the current screen, display screen2, and begin the game with a set difficulty based on what button was chosen.pli ol  pAfter jumping into the Form class, I can no longer reference Main, where I would be able to close one form and open another with ease.p  pSo the question is this. With regards to correct object oriented design. What is the most widely accepted way to change screens and start the game runningp  pI dont require code snippets or anything, I just need a basic explanation of how things should be done.p

Negative 5062 pWorking on a sort of Motif GUI design tool. After I programmatically change a property, addremove widgets, move widgets around, etc, I capture a screenshot of the Motif window showing the current window state. FYI, Im using cairo 2d to capture the Xlib surface of the window as a png.p  pMostly this works fine but sometimes my window capture happens before the UI update has completed. In particular Ive noticed this occasionally when changing a widgets font or changing the pixmap on a graphical label.p  pI want to wait until the window has finished drawing the new state before capturing the surface.p  pHow can I do that reliably It looks like Xlib exposure events occur prior to redraw.

Negative 5062 pI have a few select boxes that are acting erratically in ios.  Im running cordova 1.8.1 and have a knockout.js application running on my page.  When I select an item in the item picker, it gets selected but so do all the other items on the list.  Now, as far as I can tell the proper item is being selected and reported when I submit the form, but it looks really really bad to the user and could be very confusing.  Im doing anything fancy, here is the codep  precodeltselect classdropdownList1 stylewidth35left28positionabsolute databindvalueContactUsForm.Month,optionsContactUsForm.Months,optionsCaption Monthgtltselectgt codepre  pBut here is the result when I pick 7 for the monthp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxQhnM.png altenter image description herep  pThis is NOT a muti select box.  It seems to me that the error here is in iOS, but my suspicion is that Knockout is also doing some re rendering when I select a value.  In normal browsers the box snaps shut so you never see an intermediate state, but with ios, the box stays open until you click done.p
Negative 5062 pI have been experimenting with the multithreading features of JPL. As far as I understand from the comments in the source code one different Prolog engine is assigned per Java thread. Apparently there is a problem when a query is started in thread A, another query is executed in thread B spawned by thread A, and a third query is executed again in thread A.p  pThe following snippet of code illustrates the problemp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      try          ...         Query query         query  new Querytrue         System.out.printlnquery.hasSolution succeeds          Thread t  new Thread              Override             public void run                  Query query2  new Querytrue                 System.out.printlnquery2.hasSolution succeeds                               t.start         t.join          query  new Querytrue         System.out.printlnquery.hasSolution fatal error      catch Exception e          throw new RuntimeExceptione       codepre  pSince the JPL documentation mentions that no two queries can be active at the same time, the code waits until completion of the thread before continuing to the last query it is not yet clear to me if that constraint applies only to queries in the same thread or if it applies to queries in different threads and engines.p  pIn the previous example, only the first two queries succeed. When the third query is executed I obtain this fatal errorp  precode  A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment    SIGSEGV 0xb at pc0x000000010db65bd5, pid79191, tid7171   JRE version 7.006b24  Java VM Java HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM 23.2b09 mixed mode bsdamd64 compressed oops  Problematic frame  C  [libYap.dylib0x125bd5]  PLopenforeignframe0x45   Failed to write core dump.

When using SWI the example showed in the question is working fine.p  pStill I am puzzled with the JPL behavior in multithreaded programs. Taken a look to the source code and comments of the codeopencode method in the codeQuerycode class from the JPL libraryp  precodepublic synchronized final void open    ...   if Prolog.threadself  1   this Java thread has no attached Prolog engine     engine  Prolog.attachpoolengine  may block for a while, or fail         else   this Java thread has an attached engine     engine  Prolog.currentengine             ...  codepre  pit seems to say that JPL will create a new logic engine per thread. However, if I execute this simple programp  precodeThread t  new Thread    Override   public void run      Query query  new Queryassertx     query.hasSolution     query  new Queryx     System.out.printlnThread1 x  query.hasSolution query succeeds     t.start t.join  t  new Thread    Override   public void run      Query query  new Queryx     System.out.printlnThread2 x  query.hasSolution query also succeeds     t.start t.join codepre  pI can see the following outputp  precodeThread1 xtrue Thread2 xtrue codepre  pSo apparently the second thread is accessing the same Prolog engine than the first one, not a new one as the source code and its comments seems to suggest.p  pIf someone has experience with JPL and multithreading please clarify this.p

Negative 5062 pI have been working with a Collection View Source object that is bound to a listview and the CVS is a view on top of Observable Collection of objects.p  pI know how to apply a filter using the following techniquep  precodecvs.Filter  new FilterEventHandlerSomeFilterFunction codepre  pThis works fine when you are only filtering in one function. The problem is when I want to filter on top of the already filtered CVS. If I have another function that filters the objects in the view based on different criteria, the objects are filtered ONLY on the criteria in the second filter and the results of the first filter go away.p  pHere is some example code to explain my problemp  precodecvs.Filter  new FilterEventHandlerSomeFilterFunction1 cvs.Filter  new FilterEventHandlerSomeFilterFunction2  public void SomeFilterFunction1object sender, FilterEventArgs e        SomeObject example  e.Item as SomeObject       ifexample.Name.ContainsA                  e.Accepted  true              else                  e.Accepted  false           public void SomeFilterFunction2object sender, FilterEventArgs e        SomeObject example  e.Item as SomeObject       ifexample.Name.ContainsB                  e.Accepted  true              else                  e.Accepted  false         codepre  pSo in this example, I want only SomeObjects with the letters A and B accepted by the filters. My problem is that When make the call cvsFilter with the filterfunction2, only Objects Name containing the letter B are accepted, disregarding the objects with letter A. So an Objects name containing the letter B but not A are accepted, when they shouldnt be.p  pMy current solution to this problem has been creating a Master filter function that has every filter function inside of it and I run every Object through every filter and if the object makes it through ALL of the filters then it is accepted. This does work but my code is getting crazy now and logic is getting out of control. Does anyone know how to apply a new filter function on the result of the last filter for a CVS Why doesnt the CVS just do this automatically instead of sending every Object through every filter or am I not thinking about CVS in the right wayp

Negative 5062 pI am new to WPFMVVM and the examples I have found do not seem to cover an issue I am facing.p  pI have a screen for managing a rather complex business configuration object.  In MVVM I think this means I should have the followingp  ol liA XAML View with close to zero logicli liA ViewModel class that has the screen logicli liMy usual business classes fill the role of Model and have all business logicli ol  pIn my situation there are business rules that say changes to fieldA of my business class might have various side effects, for example changing the value of fieldB, or populating an entire list of subobjects.p  pI could be wrong, but I think I should keep these rules encapsulated in the business class, as these rules are not really about the screen so much as the entity.p  pNaturally, these sideeffects need to make their way back onto the screen immediately.p  pSo from the users perspective, he might edit fieldA, and see fieldB updated on the View.p  pI understand how to databind from the View to the ViewModel.p  pBut in my case, it seems that I need two layers of databinding one between the View and ViewModel, and another between the ViewModel and the Model.p  pGiven that I have essentially the same problem twice, I think one solution should apply.  So I have made my Model class into a DependencyObject, and I have made its properties into DependencyProperties.p  pLooking at fieldA for example, it would appear in all three layersp  ol liView as a visual component databound to ViewModel.FieldA, for example textBinding FieldA, ModeTwoWayli liViewModel as a DependencyProperty bound upward to the View, and downward to the Modelli liModel as a DependencyPropertyli ol  pI prefer not to directly couple my View XAML to the business object by skipping part 2, this does not seem like a clean application of the pattern to me.  Perhaps that is misguided.p  pI essentially seem to need a passthrough DependencyProperty in my ViewModel.p  pMy questionsp  ul liIs this the right general approach or am I thinking about it all wrongli liAre there examples out there using this passthrough approachli liCan someone give a code example of the proper way to create a passthrough binding between the ViewModel and Model FieldA DependencyPropertiesli ul

Negative 5062 pSublime has this behaviour which is really annoying sometimes when you have to type in constructions with lots of brackets. When you type codecode it adds codecode and puts the cursor in the middle, all fine, if you however will type codecode it will silently swallow the closing bracket.p  pThis is really annoying when typing long regexps because the brackets gets unbalanced pretty quick and this is driving me crazy. So you end up with constructions like code[az]code.p  pSo the question is  is there a way to disable this If I type a closing bracket I want it to stay, not be swallowed.p  pI have checked through Sublime configs, googled, but nobody seems to mind this behaviour.

Negative 5062 pI have a EF DataRepository Pattern, which I designed from the ground up, and works great when working with EF through the web applications that use it, but I have been tasked with producing an WCF API version of my system which works fine when only retrieving data.p  pWhen I try to create new objects these are created within the web service method and are not serilaized from the request I get the following issuep  precodeAn entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker codepre  pNow I had seen this previously when developing the system, but this had been because I was creating a new Context for every call, I remedied this by throwing my context into strongHttpContext.Current.Itemsstrong which as I say works great in the web applications, but now when I a call the code to give me the Context, HttpContext is Null as expected so the code would again generate a new Context for each call within the method.p  pTo fix this I gave my service providers the ability to send a Context as a parameter when initialising the service provider.  I then declare the Context at the start of the method, which means all calls within this method use the same context. p  pBut I am still getting the same issuep  pSample codep  precodepublic MyObject DoSomething      var dbContext  new myContext      var foos  new FooHelperdbContext.GetAllFoos      var bah  new bah     bah.Foo  foos.First     bah.title  youre a real object      new bahHelperdbContext.Createbah  codepre
Negative 5062 pIve read that a UIViewController is really supposed to manage the root view of your views hierarchy, and as a general practice, while you can use it for Navigation controllers or splitview controllers, you yourself arent supposed to use the view it exposes as a subview of another view thats also managed by a UICiewController, creating a nested ViewController hierarchy.p  pIn short, youre not supposed to use a UIViewController for Subviews.p  pOr at least thats the way it originally was.p  pHowever, I vaguely remember this has changed in the later SDKs and its now supported, but I cant remember or find if theres a new UIViewControllerlike class or subclass for this purpose, or if Apple enhanced the standard UIViewController for that role.p  pOur usecase is a UICollectionView subclass that isnt fullscreen, but rather a smaller part of another view.  There may even be multiple instances of it on the same screen.  Since UICollectionViewController already conforms to UICollectionViewDelegate and UICollectionViewDataSource, we figured wed just start using that.  Is this the right approachp

How can I retrieve pointer values correctly Thank you.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt includestructHeader.h include ltstdint.hgt  void initiateParams void displayParams char itoaint value, char result, int base   typedef struct MyStruct      char characterSet     uint16t intigerData     uint16t  intigerDataPtr   MyStruct  const uint16t bufferSize    400 MyStruct myArray[400] int main       initiateParams     displayParams      printfended     return 0   void initiateParams     uint16t i     fori  0  i lt 4bufferSize  i         uint16t k  i  bufferSize         MyStruct myStruct         myStruct.intigerData  i         char c         char c2  itoai , ampc , 10         c  c2          myStruct.characterSet  ampc         myStruct.intigerDataPtr  amp i          printfsrn , ampdig         myArray[k]  myStruct        void displayParams     uint16t i     fori  0  i lt bufferSize  i         MyStruct api  myArray[i]          printfretrieved integer value d , character pointer value srn                  , api.intigerData , api.characterSet         printfsrn , api.characterSet          C version 0.4 char style itoa  Written by Luks Chmela  Released under GPLv3.  char itoaint value, char result, int base       check that the base if valid     if base lt 2  base gt 36  result  0 return result       char ptr  result, ptr1  result, tmpchar     int tmpvalue      do          tmpvalue  value         value  base         ptr  zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba9876543210123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz                  [35  tmpvalue  value  base]      while  value        Apply negative sign     if tmpvalue lt 0 ptr       ptr  0     whileptr1 lt ptr              tmpchar  ptr             ptr ptr1             ptr1  tmpchar          return result  codepre

I need to do further logic dependent on whether a Customer has orders or not.p  pIm not sure whether this can be achieved with IF..ELSE, CASE, or a nested SELECTp

Negative 5062 pI want to compare two strings in a SQLite DB without caring for the accents and the case. I mean vnement should be equal to evenment.p  pOn Debian Wheezy, the SQLite package doesnt provide ICU. So I compiled the official SQLite package version 3.7.15.2 20130109 115305 with contains an ICU module. Now, I do have a better Unicode support the originalcodelowercode applied only to ASCII chars, now it works on other letters.

Negative 5062 pI realize this is an issue raised a lot in questions around here and I read many of them, and its not trivial to quickly explain the developmentscenario, so Ill squeeze it into a specific simplequestion which may explain everything, and I did not come acrossp  pRegardless of how the templates and settingsparameters generate the final url, they end up successfully generating an imageurl pasted in one of the renderedpages something like localhost8000staticimagesimagename.jpg which I can see and everythings perfect.p  pThe problem I have is in a different codepart and app, where I keep getting 404s although the generated url seems to match my existing directory amp files and I have no idea why it fails. So what I did is simply copy the image I cant seem to load, into the same legitfolder just pasted the file there, and modified the url localhost8000staticimagesnewimagename.jpg  and got a 404 even after reloading django. I dont think this has to do anything with the dbobjects ImageField etc, since im only challenging the urlparseandconversion mechanism  and cant figure out why it works for some but not all images on the some path same jpg format, image is loaded successfully in an image editor and in fact was drawn in mspaint.p  purls include urlpatterns  staticfilesurlpatterns and thats the only staticrelevant urlline as far as I can tell.p  pAny idea will be appreciated, I must be missing something about the urldecoding.p  pThanks.p

Negative 5062 pAfter reviewing all the different options I am still confused. Here is the scenario.  We have multiple databases on the same server that we would like to have a Single SSIS job handle imports or exports into from a table from a file.  We are calling this from vb.net and the job is running on SSIS on the server.  We dont have xpcmdshell available. We need to pass to the job unique job information it is possible that 2 people could be running the same job on the same db or on a different db on the same server, the database connection information This cannot be stored and selected in the job, as dbs may be addedremoved as needed and we dont want to reconfigure the job and the file namepath on the server or permitted UNC path available to SSIS.br We have looked at the option of declaring the jobjob steps and then directly executing the job.  We like this idea in that the Jobs would be unique and we could have the sql proc that the job calls report issues back to a common log table by the job id, which would then be available to review.br What I dont really follow is how to pass the information that this job needs.br In a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comCallingaSSISPackagea35afefb relnofollowhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comCallingaSSISPackagea35afefba I see them passing parameters using the set command, but I get confused by the explanation of the call that things are processed twice.  Also, in that example, would I be changing the Master DB reference to my DB in the Add Job Step My issue is that no example is really clean and simple passing parameters and changing DBs, a lot use different options like a list of dbs to process from a data source and none really cleanly show me what to do with a variable that will be passed on down to a called stored procedure.br I dont have time to delve deep and experiment, I need to see how it is done as I am trying to understand it at a level back so I know how we can utilize it and fit the information we need to use ie what do I need for connection information to dynamically assign it as I need to know it to understand where in the grand scheme I am getting that information.  We dont store that in the actual DB doing the job, we have a repository in a central DB for that, but I dont know exactly what I need to store Brian p

Negative 5062 pI have been playing with loosely coupling my data access layer.  I found the Dependency injection process quite helpful, but ran into a bit of a conundrum when considering the use of generics.p  pIs there a way to get a class that supports a generic type parameter to truly be both decoupled and type safe  My concern is that even if you write to a common interface if the derived type down the road is different than the entities you originally coded to then you can run into some nasty runtime errors that the compiler may not catch.p  pThe issue is that when I write the code to get the data from the database and hydrate my object I am faced with a conundrum when trying to implement it on the next layer up.  If I pass in an class such as Foo2 below I can break my code as there is no implicit conversion.  I had been working with reflection to try and loosen things up, but I keep coming back to the issue that when getting the data from the database I need to hydrate a concrete type.  That type then creates issues with casting and type assurance.  Additionally, if I wanted to abstract all the methods for all the many types in my entity library I can do this with reflection, but I still run into the issue that a generic can only make type assurances on explicitly where T  ISomeInterface statements.  Finally, this model would break down if we have more derived types down the road or types that branch off from interfaces to form new types.  Thinking I would need to implement new Data Access Objects for every single type ever made would force changes in the Data Access Layer.  That breaks the definition of loose coupling in my mind.p  pAll of this seems to force me back to the question  Can generics be used in a truly loose coupled way  If so, what references can you offerp  pSimplified Examplep  precodepublic interface IEntity       stuff for state and methods ...  public interface IRepositoryltTgt where T  IEntity      void Saveout int id, T obj     T Loadint id  public interface IFoo  IEntity      int Id  get set      All other IEntities goodness     Some new goodness specific to Foo  Concrete Entities public class Foo  IFoo       blah blah  public class Foo2  IFoo       new blah blah   public class FooRepository  IRepositoryltFoogt OOPS, Looks like we have settled in on a concrete type       public void Saveout int id, Foo obj               ADO.NET code to access Sql ...         id  1 this would actually be the result of the Sql insert output parameter         return           public Foo Loadint id              Foo foo  new Foo          ADO.Net code to access Sql         return foo       codepre  pSo how would you deal with code that could handle any IFoo derived object and still be able to return a fully formed concrete type regardless of what programmers do down the road  Is it best to ditch the generic portion and stick with the dependency injection  Any references, guidance, etc. would be great.  p

Negative 5062 pWe have around 45 vendor MSIs which we need to install on our servers we are talking about close to 50k machines . During install there are bunch of properties which we need to pass on based on the machine on which it is running. p  pI had put together a WIX Bundle package which reads the properties which it needs from the Registry and for the writing the Registry values I created a C console application. So the final output for deployment would be 3 files console app, console app.config, wixbundle.exe. I didnt create any custom bootstrapper for this and am just using the default bootstrapper for this application.p  pNow another group dealing with the same 6MSIs have come up with a VBScript to do the installation of the Vendor Msis. They have also written logic to manage the upgradepatches etc. We need to make a decision to go forward and I would like to know the pros and cons about this. I will mention what I think and please add to this or correct me if am wrong. p  pAM not for or against any solution, but I need to make sure that the solution can be sustained for years to come. We will be using this for another 510 years atleast.p  pAny help is much appreciatedp  pPros of WIX Bundle 1. All the MSIs are grouped together as a single entity, so the uninstallation is very easy compared to the VBScript. 2. We have a version associated with the WIX Bundle and dont have to find the version of the individual MSIs. 3. The console application controls writing the properties need for the WIXBundle, so the service accountpassword etc has some kind of abstraction.  p  pCons of WIX BUndle 1. I dont how exactly its going to deal with the patches and upgrades. I see lot of posts which are saying they see issues with patchesupgrades in wix bundle. 2. Reading the arguments through the registry is not the best of the solution. It would have been better if I could pass on the properties as command line to the WIX bundle. I understand that I will have to write a custom bootstrapper for this 3. p  pPros of VBScript 1. Atleast in our case, the solution with VBScript works and there is no need for additional work. 2. p  pCons of VbScript 1. During installation we use multiple service accounts, these service accounts change based on the machine, but in the VB script all these accounts based on each machine as well as the password is hardcoded.  2. Maintainign the script, since it has logic for uninstallationupgradepatchin etc which uses the GUIDversion number etc. We need to handholdupdate the vbscript for each of the release to make sure that it works fine.p

This value is logged as a new entry in the Employee History and is active as of, say, April 17th. So from April 17th onward he is now being calculated at 25.00  [QtyHours].p  pOn a daily report this is straight forward as a query checks the report date and calculates the totals for Employee1. Whether the report is March 17th or April 25th, the query looks up the assigned rate and figures the total cost.p  pHowever, if I were to create an administrative report that was to evaluate the total cost of all days between March 17th and June 3rd, there may be several changes in the employee rates that need to be accounted for. p  pThis is where Im having a problem. I cant figure out how to not show any previous rates if DateApplicable is lt DateRecorded.p  pHow might I go about writing a query that determines the rate on each day  dependent on the value in the Employee History  and calculate a total sump  pI apologize in advance if this question isnt phrased very well, but thanks a heap for any helpp

For example, I get errors like thisp  ul lipcodeerror mutex in namespace std does not name a typecode the file in question includes ltthreadgt and this error goes away if I also include ltmutexgt, not a requirement on x86 Ubuntupli lipcodeerror expected classname before  tokencode the line before  is codetemplatelttypename Resgt class basicfuture  public stdfuturebasecodepli lipcodeerror resulttype does not name a typecode this probably happens because of the error abovepli ul  pThese errors look like the ARM g compiler just doesnt like templates that much.

Negative 5062 pSimilar questions have been asked about the nature of when to use POST and when to use GET in an AJAX requestp  pstrongHerestrong a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions195212whataretheadvantagesofusingagetrequestoverapostrequestWhat are the advantages of using a GET request over a POST requestap  pstrongand herestrong  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1376369getvspostajaxrequestswhenandhowtouseeitherGET vs. POST ajax requests When and how to use eitherap  pHowever, I want to make it clear that that is not exactly what I am asking. I get idempotence, sensitive data, the ability for browsers to be able to try again in the event of an error, and the ability for the browser to be able to cache query string data.p  pMy real scenario is such that I want to prevent my users from being able to simply enter in the URL to my Compute.cshtml file i.e. the file on the server that my jQuery code.ajaxcode function posts to.p  pI am in a WebMatrix C.net webpages environment and I have tried to precede the file name with an underscore codecode, but apparently an AJAX request falls under the same criteria that this underscore was designed to prevent the display of and it, of course, breaks the request.p  pSo if I use POST I can simply use this logicp  precodeif IsPost  if this is not a post...      Response.Redirect ...redirect back to home page.  codepre  pIf I use GET, I suppose I can send additional data like a string containing the value codeAccessGrantedcode and check it on the other side to see if it equals this value and redirect if not, but this could be easily duplicated through typing in the address bar not that the data is sensitive on the other side, but....p  pAnyway, I suppose I am asking if it is okay to always use POST to handle this logic or what the appropriate way to handle my situation is in regards to using GET or POST with AJAX in a WebMatrix C.net webpages environment.p
Negative 5062 pI have a fairly low concurrency application which is latency sensitive where the data has to be written across two data centers. p  pThe database will have four physical hosts for redundancy a primary and secondary in the main A data centre and a pair of hot standby hosts in the secondary B data centre. Call them AP, AS, BP, BS. p  pWe want automated failover between AP and AS in the main data centre but manual promotion of hosts in the secondary data centre if we have to swap data centres. p  pWe have additional hardware to run an arbitrator node in each data centre to ensure that master election is based on three hosts within a given data centre. The arbitrator in the B data centre will be offline. As we dont want the B side hosts to be promoted without manual intervention we can set their priority to zero. p  pWe would like to achieve safe writes from java clients running in the A data centre that are confirmed to be on three of the four nodes AP, AS, and BP. p  pIs a vanilla four node setup okay If we loose the A data centre, servers BS and BP might not both be up to the same read. If we turn on the B side arbitrator, and increase the priorities on the B side to prefer BP as master can we expect BS and BP come up date with the latest reads  p  pOr to get data into AP, AS and BP should we setup a three data node replica set of AP, AS and BP that the clients will write to with a w3 error check and somehow chain BS off the back of BP [edit No specifying w3 is dangerous when nodes are taken down for maintenance or if connectivity to the B side is lost.]p

Negative 5062 pAre there other alternatives using AutoMapper Queryable extensions to avoid null reference exception when attempting to map from a child objectp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pWhen using AutoMapper Queryable extensions to project onto CustomerViewModel, mapping the FullAddress property fails with a null reference exception.

Test named strongcanmapAsQuerablewithprojectionthisFAILSstrong is the failing test.  p  pThe desire is to continue using AutoMapper and the Queryable Extensions because the code is expressive and easy to read however, calculating the FullAddress throws Null Reference Exception.

Only thing I can think is 200 ifelse statements and blocks that will surely kill the performance of my app.p  pAny other way to do this p  pId appreciate a short example  Thank you p

Negative 5062 pI have a custom codeListViewcode where I display some weapons which are retrieved from a local database. I have a total of 88 rows, for each row a text and an image is set each time codegetViewcode is called. The codeListViewcode lags while scrolling fast and the garbage collector is going insane, deleting some 1M objects per second. Im not getting why. p  pBefore I post my codeAdaptercode implementation, some explanation about how the Image is set. My strongWeaponstrong class is simply a data holder with setters and getters. This is how names and images are getting set when the database gets created yeah it might seem very strange, but all other solutions work even more slowlyp  precode    private Weapon buildWeaponCursor cursor      Weapon w  new Weapon     w.setIdcursor.getLong0     w.setNamecursor.getString1     w.setImageConstants.ALLWEAPONIMAGES[int cursor.getLong01]       return w  codepre  pSo I have an codeArraycode containing all weapon images in the form of codeR.drawable.someguncode.

If I tail the file I dont see output for minutes at a time, and the output is choppy, that is to say, the output may be cut off, as seen below.p  precodefoovarlog tailf openports.log   stats.foo.openports.broadsoft1 1 1378477047.01 stats.foo.openports.broadsoft2 1 1378477047.01 stats.foo.openports.bash 15 1378477047.01 stats.foo.openports.flash 16 1378477047.01 stats.foo.openports.cash 16 1378477047.01 stats.foo.openports codepre  pWhen I expect to see thisp  precodestats.foo.openports.broadsoft1 1 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.broadsoft2 1 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.bash 14 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.flash 16 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.cash 16 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.NS2 13 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.NMS 16 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.Netsun1 13 1378477036.44 stats.foo.openports.Cacti 16 1378477036.44  Metrics sent. codepre  pWhy does this happen and what can I do to fix this  As far as I can tell its not affecting anything but Id like to know why it does this and what I can do to correct this behavior.p

Inside this modal, more inputs and selects, members of the same form. The data gets populated nicely. If I modify some values, close this 2nd modal, and open it again, the modified values are kept.p  pThe problem is that if I submit the form the button is on the 1st modal window the inputs in the 2nd modal dont get posted...p  pWhat am I missing Cant this be done Should I try using some form of matching, so when the 2nd modal closes some hidden inputs in the 1st modal get populated and they get

Negative 5062 pI have been spending the last few days writing a fragment shader that will handle the background for a 2d game im making. However, today I noticed that my cloud rendering is extremley slow drop from 3000 to 300 fps when rendering.p  pAt first I thought that it was because I had done something stupid when generating the clouds, but after some experiments I noticed that the slowdown only happned when I added the clouds t the glFragColor. Calculating them seemed to not have any impact on performance.p  pI generate the clouds like thisp  precodefloat randvec2 co   return fractsindotco.xy ,vec212.9898,78.233  43758.5453   float hash float n  Borrowed from voltage      return fractsinn43758.5453   float fBmWRand vec2 p Borroowed from Mark Sleith      float f  0.0     f  0.50000rand p  p  p2.02     f  0.25000rand p  p  p2.03     f  0.12500rand p  p  p2.01     f  0.06250rand p  p  p2.04     f  0.03125rand p      return f0.984375   float noise in vec2 x Borroowed from Mark Sleith  vec2 p  floorx vec2 f  fractx     f  ff3.02.0f     float n  p.x  p.y57.0     float res  mixmix hashn  0.0, hashn  1.0,f.x, mix hashn 57.0, hashn 58.0,f.x,f.y     return res   float fbm vec2 p  Borroowed from Mark Sleith          float f  0.0         f  0.50000noise p  p  p2.02         f  0.25000noise p  p  p2.03         f  0.12500noise p  p  p2.01         f  0.06250noise p  p  p2.04         f  0.03125noise p          return f0.984375   vec3 bgGradient      Getting the height of the current pixel     float height  glFragCoord.y  iResolution.y      Calculating the brightness of the pixel     float brightness  1.0  0.4  height      Combining everything into a background     vec3 grad  vec31., 1., 1.  brightness     return grad   bool star  Getting a position to run random calculations with float pos  glFragCoord.x  iResolution.x  glFragCoord.y  iResolution.y  0.5  ifhashpos lt 0.001      return true  return false  iffBmWRandglFragCoord.xy  iResolution.xy lt 0.08      return true  return false   float cloudFadeDist  0.1 The distance at which the clouds will start fading away  vec4 clouds vec2 point   vec4 result  vec40., 0., 0., 0.

First one was close to 824KB and second one was 11KB.p  pCan anyone suggest why the dll generated using VS 2010 IDE is crashing whereas generated using nmake is working fine with the same code including wrapper filep

Negative 5062 pYou can set a codeTextViewcodes codeinputTypecode to one of the values from codeInputTypecode to hint that the typedin text should be a persons name, phone number, ampc. Even if the input method doesnt respect this hint, the codeTextViewcode uses a codeKeyListenercode andor codeTransformationMethodcode to ensure that only relevant characters can be entered, or to have effects like masking the password. Even the flags are more than just hints they can change the behaviour of the codeTextViewcode significantly the most obvious example being codeEditorInfo.TYPETEXTFLAGMULTILINEcode.p  pGoogles documentation is very vague about the actual effect of each codeinputTypecode. What characters are actually permitted in each case How does this vary by locale, if at all Even if there is no emdocumentedem answer, and its liable to change between versions, Id still like to know the expected behaviour.p

Negative 5062 pThis question has been asked a couple of times up here, but I havent found a solution yet. I have a Fedora 19 LAMP server and I just want to run the simple command codefileputcontentstest.txt, Hello therecode in order to confirm that my web server can use PHP to write data to files. Im having trouble figuring out a proper permissions scheme. To start, just for development, Apaches document root is codevarwwwhtmlcode. This directory was originally owned by a user and group called codewwwdatacode, but I changed the directorys group to the primary group of the owner of the httpd process, named codeapachecode. It is this owner that is active when PHP runs. Ive confirmed this with the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaturp.png altenter image description herep  pAs you see, the process owner is codeapachecode, the current direcory is codevarwwwhtmlphpconsolecode. The directory is owned by codewwwdatacode and members of the group codeapachecode have full access to it.p  pI have tried the following to get PHP to actually create a file in this location, but to no availp  precodechmod 777 varwwwhtmlphpconsole  chown apache varwwwhtmlphpconsole chgrp apache varwwwhtmlphpconsole  cd varwwwhtml gt test.txt chmod 777 test.txt codepre  pNothing will work while this script is run from the browser. However, when I use codefileputcontentscode with the PHP CLI, it works just like I would expect, provided that the user Im entering commands as or its group has write permissions to this directory or test file.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5XQMY.png altenter image description herep  pSo, from the command line, you see how codewwwdatacode has read, write, and execute permissions to the folder Im in. codeposixgetpwuidcode and codeposixgeteuidcode help you to find the owner of the ApachePHP process, which in this case is the same as the user logged into the console. codefileputcontentscode succesfully writes 8 bytes to the specified file. If I change the group or owner and group to something else, I get Permission denied, which absolutely makes sense.p  pIf this works on the command line, then why not when I really want it to, i.e., while actually serving web pagesp

Negative 5062 pI am starting a QT5 application with a rather complex design based on Qt Widgets. It runs on Beagleboard with a touchscreen. I will have a rather weird local invention instead of the LCD display. Its a laser painting on acrylic plate. It has no driver yet. To actually update a screen I must create a screenshot of the window as bitmap, turn it to grayscale and feed to a proprietary library, which will handle the laser. It should look cute, when ready. Unfortunately, the laser blinks on update, so I cannot just make screenshots on timer, or it will be jerky like hell.p  pI need to run a function every time a meaningful update of GUI happens, while preferably ignore things like button being pressed and released. Is there some way to create a hook without subclassing every single Qt Widget I will use The only way to do this I know is to override codepaintEventcode of everything. I want a simpler solution.p  pPossible assumptions are the application will be running under X server with dummy display, will be the only GUI app running. Some updates happen without user input. p

Negative 5062 pI am coding an android game in Eclipse with java. The main goal is to wait for a thread to finish, then to set a boolean to true. The reason is that when a user clicks a button it will only run if the boolean is true. However, when I call a method, it creates a thread and does its thing, then when it is done, it sets the boolean to true. However, it automatically sets the boolean to true while the thread is still running, and so the user can click the button which messes some things up. Is there a way to wait for a thread to finish without freezing the screen thread.join seems to be freezing itp  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 5062 pGood afternoon, or morning, depending on where you are located ofcourse. br I have a simple JQuery script using the mousetrap.js library a hrefhttpcraig.iskillingmice relnofollowhttpcraig.iskillingmicea designed to block out a set of keys. This code works fine in Chrome and I suspect that it also works in Firefox. This is due to that the event cancelBubble, stopPropagation and preventDefault is not defined for my set of keys. Again F5 is only one of approximately 1015 keys. I can provide the full array of keys which I wish to lock if that is necessary. I have tried to use the JQuery.event.fixe but that did not work and the event still got fired. Has anyone of you encountered this problem or a similar one, I would be very pleased if someone could help me with this issue.br Just to be clear, I am using IE version 8.0.7601.17514 and an update is not in question unfortunately because this is a corporate computer and our system requires that we block the keys. brThanks in advancep  precodedocument.readyfunction      Mousetrap.bind[f5], functione          ife.cancelBubble e.cancelBubble  true         ife.stopPropagation e.stopPropagation         ife.preventDefault e.preventDefault        codepre
Negative 5062 pIm working with javascript for Google Analytics API but Im no more than a novice in JS. I have C and Java knowledge and I can get along with logical thinking but some things puzzle me. In GA API I get to make a function call like thisp  precodegapi.client.analytics.data.ga.getidslttableIDgt,     startdateltstartDategt,     enddateltendDategt,     metricsltmetricsgt,     filtersltfiltersgt,     samplingLevelHIGHERPRECISION,.executeputToVar codepre  pcodeputToVarcode is a user defined function defined like sop  precodefunction putToVarresults      do processing with the results  codepre  pIt is my understanding that the code.executecode method is used to invoke a callback function for the asynchronous call codegapi.client.analytics.data.ga.getcode. So I assume what codefunction1.executefunction2code does is call codefunction2code with the return value from codefunction1code as argument Is this correctp  pIm in a situation where I need to apply several distinct filters and store them in an array to retrieve as and when required, irrespective of whether the API call returned a results object it is an async call, so I dont know when the response comes, it is only visible to the callback function.p  pI would like to pass to the callback function the dimensions of the array in which to store the returned objects so that I can retrieve them on demand later, without worrying about the order in which the responses get processed. I say this because, initially I tried a codeforcode loop and the order in which I got the response to my API calls were not the same as the order in which I placed API calls for my queries, so there were mismatches.p  pSince the reference uses this method to invoke the callback function, I would like to know how to pass additional arguments to a callback function like this when using code.executecode method, when I get to write codeputToVarcode function something like thisp  precodefunction putToVarresults,arrayDim      Process Results     Store in Array[arrayDim] the required value  codepre  pI hope I have made myself clear.

So I coded that the id values are restored in a codeArrayListcode whenever the codeCheckBoxcodees are clicked, and returned when a method is called in codeMainActivitycode.p  pThe problem is, I want for option menus to be changed if the codeCheckBoxcode is checked for example, codeDELETEcode and codeMOVEcode menu is unable when no codeCheckBoxcode is checked, and enabled once codeCheckBoxcodees are clicked, but dont know how.p  h3Some parts of my codeMainActivitycode and codeCursorAdaptercodeh3  pstrongMainActivity.javastrongp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity   private MenuItem itEdit, itSort, itView, itSelectAll, itDeselectAll, itDelete, itMove private boolean isEditChecked  private ListView lvWords private WordAdapter wordadapter private ArrayListltIntegergt checkedWords private Cursor wordCursor   Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain      lvWords  ListView findViewByIdR.id.lvwords      dbhandler  DBHandler.openthis     wordCursor  dbhandler.selectWordsactiveNoteId      wordadapter  new WordAdapterthis, wordCursor, isEditChecked     lvWords.setAdapterwordadapter      ....     ...     ..   protected void onResume      super.onResume     refreshListViews   Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu      getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.main, menu      itEdit  menu.findItemR.id.itedit     itSort  menu.findItemR.id.itsort     itView  menu.findItemR.id.itview     itSelectAll  menu.findItemR.id.itselectall     itDeselectAll  menu.findItemR.id.itdeselectall     itDelete  menu.findItemR.id.itdelete     itMove  menu.findItemR.id.itmove      itEdit.setVisibletrue     itSort.setVisibletrue     itView.setVisibletrue     itSelectAll.setVisiblefalse     itDeselectAll.setVisiblefalse     itDelete.setVisiblefalse     itMove.setVisiblefalse      return true   Override public boolean onPrepareOptionsMenuMenu menu      ....     ...     return super.onPrepareOptionsMenumenu   Override public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item      switch item.getItemId      case R.id.itedit         onEditMenuClicked         break     case R.id.itdelete         checkedWords  wordadapter.getCheckedArrayList         final int checkedDeleteSize  checkedWords.size         ....         ...              break          return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem    when edit menu clicked private void onEditMenuClicked      isEditChecked  isEditChecked     itSort.setVisibleisEditChecked     itView.setVisibleisEditChecked     itSelectAll.setVisibleisEditChecked     itDeselectAll.setVisibleisEditChecked     itDelete.setVisibleisEditChecked     itMove.setVisibleisEditChecked      wordadapter.setVisibilityisEditChecked      refreshListViews   private void refreshListViews      wordCursor.close     wordCursor  dbhandler.selectWordsactiveNoteId     wordadapter.changeCursorwordCursor     setVisibilityViews   codepre  pstrongWordAdapter.javastrongp  precodepublic class WordAdapter extends CursorAdapter   private boolean isCheckBoxVisable private ArrayListltIntegergt checkedArray private boolean setCheck  public WordAdapterContext context, Cursor c, boolean check      supercontext, c     isCheckBoxVisable  check     checkedArray  new ArrayListltIntegergt     setCheck  false   Override public void bindViewView view, Context context, Cursor cursor      CheckBox check  CheckBox view.findViewByIdR.id.cblistwordcheck      final int id  cursor.getIntcursor.getColumnIndexid      ifisCheckBoxVisable         check.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE     else check.setVisibilityView.GONE      check.setOnCheckedChangeListenernew OnCheckedChangeListener              Override         public void onCheckedChangedCompoundButton buttonView, boolean isChecked                I think something is added here               ifisChecked                 checkedArray.addid                          else                 checkedArray.removenew Integerid                              Override public View newViewContext context, Cursor cursor, ViewGroup parent      Log.dnewView,start of newView     LayoutInflater inflater  LayoutInflater.fromcontext     View v  inflater.inflateR.layout.wordlistrow, parent, false     Log.dnewView,end of newView     return v    set visibility of checkbox public void setVisibilityboolean check     isCheckBoxVisable  check   public ArrayListltIntegergt getCheckedArrayList     return checkedArray   codepre

Having used VB.NET for most of my career I thought it would be interesting to implement the app in C. However, I have encountered a problem due to my present unfamiliarity with C. p  pThe function takes in two strings of binary digits, converts these strings to char arrays, and then performs an XOR on them and places the result in a third char array.p  pThis is fine until I try to convert the third char array to a string.

Negative 5062 pI am attempting to use the MVVM pattern to display a List of objects that can be updated in the UI.  I would also like some basic operations like AddRemove.  Right now I have a simple codeCustomercode model that is just a first and last name.  I have the codeDataContextcode assigned to the codeViewModelcode.  In the codeViewModelcode class I have the model which is just a codeListcode of Customers that will be injected at a later point.   To keep the underlying codeListcode model up to date, I wrap the codeListcode with an codeObservableCollectioncode each time its accessed.  In doing this, it doesnt seem to keep the codeSelectedValuecode active because when you remove the codeSelectedValuecode, it sets it to codenullcode and clears out the selection in the codeListViewcode.  This means that I would need some manual tracking which I am hoping to avoid. I have tried to keep an codeObservableCollectioncode as a member variable to the codeViewModelcode class, but this only copies the underlying list of data and doesnt keep it synced if you addremove objects from it.p  pI also want to avoid using codeObservableCollectioncode as the model, since this seems more geared toward codeViewModelcode data binding support a hrefhttpupdatecontrols.netdoctipscommonmistakesobservablecollection relnofollowreference see Using it in the modela. Has anyone done this before and found a good way to keep the codeListcode model in sync but also data bind to the codeListViewcode using codeObservableCollectioncodep  pstrongMainWindow.xamlstrongp

Negative 5062 pI was wondering if there is a quick way in matlab pretty sure there is and I just dont know it to get all the values of an array at specific indices. Example If I have an arrayp  precodea  [1,3,5,7,9] codepre  pand I have my list of indices code[2,3]code, I am looking for a function that will give me back code[3,5]code which are the values at indices 2,3 in the array a. The straightforward solution is to loop through and index one at a time but I would like to know of a faster more efficient builtin function if one exists.p  pAnd as far as I have read, find function only returns the index where a particular value is present. I am looking for the opposite scenario wherein I pass in the indices as a array and all the values present in a at those indices are returned.

Negative 5062 pstrongSituationstrongp  pIm making a billiards simulator and have a static btBox representing the table surface with btSpheres as the balls. In the demo, both the ground table surface and the btSpheres are given positive values for rolling friction, 1.0 and 0.3 respectively. The demo shows the spheres roll naturally and eventually come to rest.p  pWhen I use these values in my simulation the spheres can never maintain an angular velocity and just skid across the table  no matter what values I set rolling friction in the surfacesphere. p  pIf I set rolling friction to zero for the surface doesnt matter which then it produces a realistic rolling behavior UNTIL the ball is about to come to rest.

Also balls will just start rolling sometimes, before any contact.p  pstrongConsiderationsstrongp  pI have tried many combinations of frictiondampening and cant reproduce the demos behavior or fix the problems I mention.

I have tried many things but cant seem to fix it. p  precodeimport java.awt.Color import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.awt.event.MouseEvent import java.awt.event.MouseListener import java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener import java.util.ArrayList  import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.Timer   public class painting extends JFrame  ArrayListltIntegergt mouseLocXList  new ArrayListltIntegergt ArrayListltIntegergt mouseLocYList  new ArrayListltIntegergt ArrayListltColorgt colors  new ArrayListltColorgt Color colorChosen  Color.black  String[] colorsSideBarButtonString  Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Pink Color[] colorsSideBar  Color.red, Color.blue, Color.green, Color.orange ,       Color.pink                           JButton[] buttons  new JButton[colorsSideBarButtonString.length]   public painting     setSize1200,700     setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     setLocationRelativeTonull     setBackgroundColor.WHITE     setLayoutnull     setFocusabletrue      addMouseMotionListenernew handler      colors.addColor.black      forint x  0 x lt colorsSideBarButtonString.length x         buttons[x]  new JButtoncolorsSideBarButtonString[x]         buttons[x].setBounds2,x5030,70,46         addbuttons[x]         buttons[x].addActionListenernew buttonListener           setVisibletrue   public static void mainString[] args     new painting   public void paintGraphics g     super.paintg      g.setColorColor.black     g.drawLine72, 0, 72, 900     g.drawLine1150, 0, 1150, 900     g.drawStringColors, 17, 45      forint i  0 i lt mouseLocXList.size i         g.setColorcolors.geti         g.fillOvalmouseLocXList.geti,mouseLocYList.geti,30,30         public class handler implements MouseMotionListener      public void mouseDraggedMouseEvent e          mouseLocXList.adde.getX         mouseLocYList.adde.getY         colors.addcolorChosen         repaint          public void mouseMovedMouseEvent e                    public class buttonListener implements ActionListener      public void actionPerformedActionEvent e          forint c  0 c lt buttons.length c             ife.getSource  buttons[c]                 colorChosen  colorsSideBar[c]                    codepre  pSorry the programs kinda long, i dont see where i can shorten it, everything seems necessary. Basically every time the mouse is clicked and dragged, its location is stored in an array, where its then drawn in a for loop in graphics. The color is clicked, and added to its own array, and every update to the mouses location while dragged, the current color is added to the colors array so it can be redrawn in color while in the for loop. I would think the best way to fix the problem is to run it. p  pOnce again, i know this is probably one of the worst written programs youve ever seen. I understand, but i am just testing out and trying to see how advanced i can make this. p

Negative 5062 pFirst I have developed much in C, now Im working on 3D web project and now the most usable language is JavaScript at the moment.p  pIn C until there becomes the new keywords codeasyncawaitcode in new C specification there was a way to make asynchronous calls by usingp  ul lidelegatesli liBeginEnd functions, like BeginInvoke, EndInvokeli liIAsync interfaceli ul  pAs for JS... Right now I have a need to use some parallel computations and really need a stuff, which is similar to asynchronous work with some locking models like Semaphore, Mutex or other..p  pAs for asyncawait...

Negative 5062 pIve bee experimenting with GMail IMAP API using the gmail ruby gem and was unable to pull search results for old emails. More specifically, if I would search for emails about a year ago they would not show up in the search result. This seems consistent with the Mail app on iPhone which also uses IMAP and seems likes its impossible to retrieve old emails.  It seems like this might be related to some limit that Gmail is putting on the IMAP interface which limits it only to the first 1000 emails. p  pAnybody else can confirm this  Is there a way around thisp

Negative 5062 pIve created a set of 3 Java JAXWS web services that each generate their own WSDL file but they are all contained in the same project amp web app.p  pThey share many of the same request  response objects.  For example all the all of the request amp response objects inherit from BaseRequest and BaseResponse classes.p  pWhen I create a client using C .NET it creates multiple BaseRequest and BaseResponse classes, one for each WSDL file, but what I would really like it to do is only create one set of shared BaseRequest and BaseResponse classes.p  pIt seems that I can accomplish this if I make all of my separate web services share the same target namespace.

Negative 5062 pI have an app which requires users to log in. Logging in is handled via a POST request to my backend REST API, which generates a new access token if the login details are correct and returns it to the app which is then saved in the keychain. My question is, how do I handle cases when a user logs in from multiple devices at once The device who logged in first will not realize that their access token has expired, but will continue to try to send requests which will be denied because the access token no longer matches the one stored in the database. I have thought about checking that the access token matches the database token in viewDidLoad in my AppDelegate, but this would only work when the app is first loaded. Is there best practice already established for this sort of thing If so what is itp  pThe best solution I have thought of so far is to just reissue the same access token each time the user logs in, but this seems insecure to me. Is this a safe way to handle itp

Negative 5062 pI am developing phonegap application . I want to add native  slide page transition while switching the pages. I am not using jquery mobile. Instead of that I am using the bootstrap . But the problem is there is nothing for page transitions in the bootstrap. so is there any way in jquery or javascript using which it can be implemented in the application.I have searched a lot but all the example are only for the div transitions . p
Negative 5062 pSo Ive made a forms application with visual studio 2012 using .NET 4.5 framework. The application exe works fine only on my computer. Ive tried two other computers to run it on but both seem not to be able to run it. Ive installed .NET framework 4.5 on both the machines ofcourse. The error on the one is p  blockquote   pTo run this application, you must first install one of the following   versions of the .NET Framework   v4.0.30319br   Contact your   application publisher for instructions about obtaining the    appropriate version of the .NET Framework.p blockquote  pAnd the other machine just brings up the windows error message which says that the application has stopped working. Again, both computers have .NET framework 4.5 installed. Ive also tried to install 4.0 to try but the installer says that a newer version is detected so I dont need to install this one pretty obvious.  I also tried to publish it so itll generate a setup program to install prerequisite components, but again the setup works fine on my computer and doesnt even start on the other.p  pThanks in advance. p

I need to both select sentences by an index daysentence, as well as perform operations on the entire sentence group such as mapping functions to these groups, as opposed to individual rows.p  pIt seems that both GroupBy and hierarchical indexing have some benefits  GroupBy seems to make it easier to perform calculations on the group level, while hierarchical indexing makes it easier to pluck specific phrases out of the dataframe for other purposes. Can anyone advise on which technique would be more appropriate Or is some combination of the two the best way to gop  pThank youp

Negative 5062 pI am doing some front end testing using Sahi, and its built in methods setFile amp setFile2 are not flexible enough for the file uploading approach being used by the site. For this reason, I am wondering if I can add an input element to the browser and attach file elements and then execute a drag drop via Sahi to get the file elements passed to the droppable area. Does anyone know if its possible to drag files from one browser input tag to another or another viable approachp

Negative 5062 pI am using codePostgrescode as main DB and REDIS for caching. I am working on caching mechanism for one db query which takes to much time Its about 56 JOINS  nested SELECTS. For now I am caching results of this query using codeSET some key JSON.stringifyquery.resultcode. This works fine, however I have one column that cannot be cached  it is called codecommentsCountcode. It has to be always up to date. As a temporary solution, I am querying db just for this one particular field like thisp  precodeapp.getpostgetBySlugslug,functionreq,res,next    var cacheKey  req.params.slugreq.params.language  mypostslugenus for example    cache.getcacheKey, functionerr, post       throw err if err       ifpost           db.getPostCommentsCount where  id post.id .donefunctionerr,commentsCount              throw err if err              post.commentsCount  commentsCount              res.jsonpost              next                  else           db.getFullPostBySlugreq.params.slug, req.params.language.donefunctionerr, post             throw err if err             cache.setcacheKey, post             res.jsonpost             next                       codepre  pBut it is still now what I want, because main DB is still queried.

At the begining counters were stored in language translations.pli lipGenerally this query looks for post where exists translation with specific slug and language sluglanguage on post translation is unique index. Morover post has to be published isPublished  boolean and post.status has to be published status  enum or post.iscomingSoon has to be true isComingSoon  boolean. Do you have idea what indexordering I could add to this query Or should I just remove limitpli lipIn every translation table I keep language as TEXT. It can be for example enus or zhcn etc. Do you think I should make it enum or maybe I should make another table to store languages and just keep languageid in translationspli lipAuthor actually can be null pli ol

Negative 5062 pAs a basic Prolog exercise, I set myself the task of writing a binary tree height predicate that would work forwards and backwards  that is, as well as determining the height of a known binary tree, it should be able to find all binary trees including unbalanced ones of a known height.

So Im basically abusing lists as Peanostyle natural numbers. The reasons this is convenient are...p  ol liNo concerns about negative numbers.li liI can check for  or  without knowing the exact number  for example, by matching two items on the head of the list, I ensure the list length is 2 without caring about the length of the tail.li ol  pNeither of these properties seem to apply to Prolog numbers, and I cant think of a way so far to adapt the same basic approach to use actual numbers in place of these lists.p  pIve seen a few examples in Prolog using Peanostyle numbers, so my question is  is this normal practice Or is there some way to avoid the issue that I havent spotted yetp  pAlso, is there a way to convert tofrom a Peanostyle representation that wont break the bidirectionality The following dont work for fairly obvious reasons...p  precodelengthL,N, treeeq1L,X.    infinite set of lists to explore if N is unknown  treeeq1L,X, lengthL,N    infinite set of trees to explore if X is unknown codepre  pThe best I can think of so far is an isthisvariableinstantiated test to choose between implementations, which seems like cheating to me.p  pBTW  I have some ideas for other methods which I emdontem want spoilers for  particularly a kind of dynamic programming approach.

This wont work because codeHTTPREFERERcode can be blank or changed.p  pMy second thought was to use codeJavaScriptcode in the pasted script to get the codedocument.locationcode and pass that back the to server.

Negative 5062 pI have been recently working on a scripts that takes file, chunks it and analyze each piece. Because the chunking positions depend on the content, I need to read it one byte at a time. I do not need random access, just reading it linearly from beginning to end, selecting certain positions as I go and yielding the content of the chunk from the previous selected position to the current one.p  pIt was very convenient to use a memory mapped file wrapped by a codebytearraycode. Instead of yielding the chunk, I yield the offset and size of the chunk, leaving the outer function to slice it.p  pIt was also faster than accumulating the current chunk in a codebytearraycode and much faster than accumulating in codebytescode. But I have certain concerns that I would like to addressp  ol liIs bytearray copying the datali liI open the file as coderbcode and the codemmapcode with codeaccessmmap.ACCESSREADcode. But codebytearraycode is, in principle, a mutable container. Is this a performance problem Is there a read only container that I should useli liBecause I do not accumulate in the buffer, I am random accessing the codebytearraycode and therefore the underlying file. Even though it might be buffered, I am afraid that there will problems depending on the file size and system memory. Is this really a problemli ol

All black line art on white will yield 0 for their H value  just is a side effect of whats done, their hue channel is black either way. So those could easily be categorized as such. I do not have a sufficient set of images to make predictions and adjust the bilateralFilter accordingly.

Negative 5062 pI am trying to use CXFreeze to distribute python code for multiple platforms. In windows all went well but I am stuck trying to use CXFreeze 5 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with python 3.4.

After two days of looking I havent found a good answer yet so Im going to ask here. If  answer is found, maybe it will help someone else as well. Thank you for any advice you can give.p  pEdit Judging from the number of views this post has gotten it is not a very common problem, however I found a solution and I want to share it in the hopes that it will help someone. The solution was to use cxFreeze 4.3.3 instead of 5. You can find version 4.3.3 here as a tar.gz file a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypiactiondisplayampnamecxFreezeampversion4.3.3 relnofollowhttpspypi.python.orgpypiactiondisplayampnamecxFreezeampversion4.3.3a .

Negative 5062 pIf I have a gif89a which has multiple image blocks that are identical and small, say 40x40 or 1600 pixels in size, should these continue to increase the final size of the gif file assuming a sane encoderp  pIm trying to understand how the LZW compression works. According to the W3C spec, I thought the entire data stream itself consisting of multiple image blocks should be be compressed, and thus repeating the same image frame multiple times would incur very little overhead just the size of the symbol for the the repeated image block. This does not seem to be the case, and Ive tested with several encoders Gimp, Photoshop. p  pIs this to be expected with all encoders, or are these two just doing it poorly p  pWith gimp, my test gif was 23k in size when it had 240 identical image blocks, and 58k in size with 500 image blocks, which seems less impressive than my intuition is telling me my intuitions pretty dumb, so I wont be shocked ifwhen someone tells me its incredibly wrong.p  p[edit]p  pI need to expand on what it is Im getting at, I think, to receive a proper answer. I am wanting to handcraft a gif image and possibly write an encoder if Im up to it that will take advantage of some quirks to compress it better than would happen otherwise.p  pI would like to include multiple subimages in the gif that are used repeatedly in a tiling fashion. If the image is large in this case, 1700x2200, gif cant compress the tiles well because it doesnt see them as tiles, it rasters from the top left to the bottom right, and at most a 30 pixel horizontal slice of any given tile will be given a symbol and compressed, and not the 30x35 tile itself.p  pThe tiles themselves are just the alphabet and some punctuation in this case, from a scan of a magazine. Of course in the original scan, each a is slightly different than every other, which doesnt help for compression, and theres plenty of noise in the scan too, and that cant help.p  pAs each tile will be repeated somewhere in the image anywhere from dozens to hundreds of times, and each is 30 or 40 times as large as any given slice of a tile, it looks like there are some gains to be had supposing the gif file format can be bent towards my goals.p  pIve handcreated another gif in gimp, that uses 25 subimages repeatedly about 700 times, but I lost count. It is 90k in size unzipped, but zipping it drops it back down to 11k. This is true even though each subimage has a different topleft coordinate but thats only what, 4 bytes up in the header of the subimage.p  pIn comparison, a visually identical image with a single frame is 75k. This image gains nothing from being zipped.p  pThere are other problems Ive yet to figure out with the file its gif89a, and treats this as an animation even though Ive set each frame to be 0ms in length, so you cant see it all immediately. I cant even begin to think how you might construct an encoder to do this... it would have to select the bestlooking or at least one of the betterlooking versions of any glyph, and then figure out the best  x,y to overlay it even though it doesnt always line up very well.p  pIts primary use I believe would be for magazines scanned in as cbrcbz ebooks.p  pIm also going to embed my handcrafted gif, its easier to see what Im getting at than to read my writing as I stumble over the explanationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comItmxg.gif altenter image description herep

Negative 5062 pI was asked to write an IMAP proxy that would act as a real IMAP server, except that it would translate all requests from clients to the backend IMAP server. In this setup, the client connects to proxy directly and doesnt necessarily know about the backend. The idea is to have the proxy monitor all the mail the client fetches.p  pI have been looking into Twisted for accomplishing this task, because Twisted has a codeproxycode module and it also has implementations of IMAP4 for client and server.p  pI would like to know if there are any difficulties with secure connections that one should be aware of. The program must monitor all traffic, thus it must maintain two secure connections with two different certificates. Is this feasible if the proxy has a certificate that the client trusts Are there any pitfallsp  pAlso, is it possible to use the codeproxycode module for this Ive seen a simple IMAP proxy written with this module, but the a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocumentscurrentapitwisted.web.proxy.html relnofollowdocs saya its for HTTP proxying.p

Negative 5062 pI am developing a webapp HTML5, pure JavaScript, no JQuery, and its a image gallery.p  pImages thumbs are loaded using Image object, and then drawn into a Canvas2D.

Negative 5062 pIve searched but havent found a good answer for this.  Im working with a few different webcams in DirectShow. Two of them produce a 4x3 aspect ratio image, which is what I need in my app. The last one only produces 16x9. After searching the docs, I think the Color Converter DMO should do what I want. I connected it in my graph after the capture device so CapDev output pin goes to ColorConvert input pin. Then I use the filters IWMColorConvProps interface to call SetFullCroppingParam to crop the video to the size and aspect ratio I want. That part seems to work.p  pHowever, on screen, what I see is still a 16x9 image, but only the left size of it a 4x3 rectangle has video, while the right side is black.  When I query the filters downstream from the Color Converter, it looks like they are still getting AMMEDIATYPE with the width and height set to the original 16x9 image.p  pDoes anyone know what is really needed to crop a video stream to some arbitrary size and aspect ratio  Am I using the correct filter Color Converter DMO, and if so, how do I get the rest of the filters to see the proper size image  If not, what filter should I use for cropping However, all the filters downstream from thisp

Negative 5062 pI have a database with product UPC numbers and vendor ID numbers.  Its possible for multiple vendors to supply the same products, so a simple query against UPC can and often does return multiple rows.  However, there is a vendor preference list because vendors sell the same product at different prices, and my goal is to return the product entry from the most preferred vendor.  In short, given five vendors numbered 1 through 5, the preferred vendor list may be vendors  array5,3,1,2,4.  Different users have different preference lists.  Therefore, right now Im creating the preferred vendor list, looping through queries up to five actually 83 times, and stopping the first time a query returns a row.  Its very slow.  Is there a single MySQL command that accepts sorts by an arbitrary list of column values and, using LIMIT 1, return only the first found valuep  precodeSELECT  FROM products WHERE upc123456789123 AND vendor5 SELECT  FROM products WHERE upc123456789123 AND vendor3 codepre  pTheoretically becomes something like...p  precodeSELECT  FROM products WHERE upc12345678123 AND vendor5, 3 LIMIT 1 codepre

I do not understand why since it should emit a new line for each codewordidcode which is the key for the reducer.p  pThe mapper produces the correct output pair of codewordidcode and values of codedocidtfcode on separate lines. I tested that without the reducer. The reducer is supposed to just append the values corresponding to the same key on one line for each key.p  pCould you please take a look on my code specifically on the reducer and configuration of the job and tell me why does the reducer emit only one huge line instead of multiple lines corresponding to the specified keys I spent many hours debugging this and cannot make my head around it.p  precodepublic class Indexer extends Configured implements Tool              Vocabulary key  term, value  index           private static MapltString, Integergt vocab  new HashMapltString, Integergt      public static void mainString[] arguments throws Exception          System.exitToolRunner.runnew Indexer, arguments           public static class Comparator extends WritableComparator          protected Comparator              superText.class, true                   Override         public int compareWritableComparable a, WritableComparable b               Here we use exploit the implementation of compareTo... in              Text.class.             return a.compareTob                    public static class IndexerMapper extends             MapperltObject, Text, IntWritable, Textgt          private Text result  new Text           load vocab from distributed cache         public void setupContext context throws IOException              Configuration conf  context.getConfiguration             FileSystem fs  FileSystem.getconf             URI[] cacheFiles  DistributedCache.getCacheFilesconf             Path getPath  new PathcacheFiles[0].getPath              BufferedReader bf  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReader                     fs.opengetPath             String line  null             while line  bf.readLine  null                  StringTokenizer st  new StringTokenizerline,  t                  int index  Integer.parseIntst.nextToken  first token is the line number  term id                 String word  st.nextToken  second element is the term                   save vocab                 vocab.putword, index                                 public void mapObject key, Text value, Context context                 throws IOException, InterruptedException                init TF map             MapltString, Integergt mapTF  new HashMapltString, Integergt               parse input string             StringTokenizer st  new StringTokenizervalue.toString,  t               first element is doc index             int index  Integer.parseIntst.nextToken               count term frequencies             String word             while st.hasMoreTokens                  word  st.nextToken                   check if word is in the vocabulary                 if vocab.containsKeyword                      if mapTF.containsKeyword                          int count  mapTF.getword                         mapTF.putword, count  1                      else                          mapTF.putword, 1                                                                  compute TFIDF             int wordIndex             for String term  mapTF.keySet                  int tf  mapTF.getterm                  if vocab.containsKeyterm                      wordIndex  vocab.getterm                      context.writenew IntWritablewordIndex, new Textindex    tf                                                                  public static class IndexerReducer extends ReducerltIntWritable, Text, IntWritable, Textgt              Override         public void reduceIntWritable key, IterableltTextgt values, Context context throws IOException, InterruptedException                       StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder16000              for Text value  values                              sb.appendvalue.toString                               context.writekey, new Textsb.toString                           This is where the MapReduce job is configured and being launched.

Negative 5062 pAccording to wikipedia and other resources, quick sort happens to be a special case of sample sort, because we always choose 1 partitioning item, put it in its place and continue the sort, so quick sort is sample sort, where m the number of partitioning items at each step is 1. strongSo, my question is, for 1 lt m lt n does it have the same complexity as quick sort when its not parallelstrongp  pThe following is the algorithm for sample sort described on wikipedia. p  pstrong1 Find splitters, values that break up the data into buckets, by sampling the data.strongp  pstrong2 Use the sorted splitters to define buckets and place data in appropriate buckets.strongp  pstrong3 Sort each of the buckets.strongp  pI am not exactly sure I understand this algorithm correctly, but I think we first find the partitioning item, put it in its place and then look to the left and to the right to find more partitioning items there, and then recursively call the same function to partition each one of those m samples into m samples again, strongam I rightstrong Because if so, it seems that sample sort performs the same as quick sort because it simply does the same thing, except half of it iteratively when looking for splitters and half of it recursively.p

Negative 5062 pIm new with angular and Ive read that it wasnt a good practice use it together with jQuery. p  pThere are lots of cool plugins developed in jQuery and its not possible to get them in angular... you should build them for your own in angular if you want to get the same behavior. p  pFor instance, you can find many admin dashboard templates in jQuery but just a few in angular. p  pMy question is if its really necessary to use angular in something built in jQuery by a third party or you can start your app in angular and when you need some plugin built in jQuery... just use it to avoid spending time building the same plugin in angular... Id like to know how to solve this kind of situation.p  pThanks in advance.p

I completed half of the code where user can buy but I am stuck at summing coffee salescups. p  pThe function cupsSold and totalAmount return 0 or garbage value.

Negative 5062 pI am using jquery validate plugin to validate form fields . I am also using jqtree . on click of every child node a section of form is visible to user, which is supposed to be filled with values.For every child there is a form content to be filled. Entire tree content is declared within one form only. I have a button in the form which on click generates json file. I am calling the function below to validate formp  precodemyform.validate .... ifmyform.valid    generate the json file codepre  pbut this is not validating the entire form. suppose I am on childNode1 it validates only form section defined for childNode1.

However, these methods only work for current codeSKTDownloadObjectHelpercodes. If I pull them out of codeSKTDownloadManager.storedDownloadObjectscode emafterem the app has been quit and then started again and throw them at codeSKTDownloadManager.sharedInstance.resumeDownloadForDownloadHelpercode the manager wont resume the downloads.p  pI dug a little deeper into the code and that these downloads are not getting restarted is because of a lack of a proper status. codeSKTGroupedDownloadOperation.m87codep  precodeif self.currentRunningGroupedOperation.stateDownloadItem gt SKTMapDownloadItemStatusDownloading       return NO cannot start download,isntall, finsihed  codepre  pSo, my questions is whether it is even possible to resume downloads after the app has been terminated and if so how do I do it.

Negative 5062 pscanf is automatically runnning the while loop 2 times when i enter the input  a3 c4p  pChef develops his own computer program for playing chess. He is at the very beginning. At first he needs to write the module that will receive moves written by the players and analyze it. The module will receive a string and it should report at first whether this string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board we call such strings correct and then report whether it represents the correct move depending on the situation on the chess board. Chef always has troubles with analyzing knight moves. So at first he needs a test program that can say whether a given string is correct and then whether it represents a correct knight move irregardless of the situation on the chess board. The cell on the chessboard is represented as a string of two characters first character is a lowercase Latin letter from a to h and the second character is a digit from 1 to 8. The string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board if it composed of 5 characters where first two characters represent the cell where chess figure was, 3rd character is the dash  and the last two characters represent the destination cell. Input The first line contains a single integer T lt 50000, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a nonempty string composed the characters with ASCIIcodes from 32 to 126. The length of the string is not greater than 10.

Negative 5062 pIm working on a small project, but Ive encountered a strange bug  with a canvas injected into the page with Ajax to be more specific, the jQuery strongelement.loadsomefile.htmlstrong method, it just appends the htmltext of the file into the specified element.p  pI have two modules that do different things. The first one, which is the subject of my question, is a simple canvas with 2000 particles moving randomly.  The structure works as expected, I can switch between the two modules and the DOM is updated without needing to refresh the page.p  pThe problem is that if I switch back and forth between the two projects, the performance of the canvas on the first module is decreasing.p  pThis behavior is unexpected for me, but please tell me if Im wrong when loading the template that contains the canvas tag, a new canvas element is created and the pointers to the old canvas and the old array of particles should be replaced.p  pI tested if my old canvas loops were still running in the background, but it didnt seem like it. I also tried to disable ajax caching and did some tests on the scope of the particles properties, but nothing changed, even with global variables. I also tried to cancel the requestAnimationFrame, but to no avail.p  pIm sorry if Im not being precise enough, heres a JSFiddle so that you can replicate the bug a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzq2o5w07 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netzq2o5w07a.

Negative 5062 pIm in the middle of making a wallpaper app for android and Im have a problem with Muzei support and hoping someone here can help me see what Im missing.p  pI have a JSON file which my app uses to get the wallpaper URLs and display the pictures from. It works fine and it gets the right images. However if I update the JSON with more entries and more images then the Muzei extension still uses the old database. I was thinking that maybe it caches the database and just doesnt update it for whatever reason. The only way to get it to use the updated JSON file is to clear the data of my app and set a different extension in Muzei and the reset Muzei with my extension. Which would not be very user friendly.p  pProbably just being blind but help would be appreciated.p  pArtSource.javap  precodepackage com.main.walls.muzei  import android.content.Intent import

Negative 5062 pI am currently working my way through the codeUdacitycode iOS Development Nanaodegree and have come up against a problem that I am really struggling to solve. I am new to development, and Stackoverflow, so this is my first post.... here it goesp  pI am building an app used to generate Memes. It does that by allowing a user to pick an image and enter some text.p  pI have a codeUIViewcode. In that codeUIViewcode I have 2x codeUIToolbarcode, 2x codeUITextFieldcode and a codeUIImageViewcode. The toolbars are positioned at the top and bottom of the view, the text fields beneath and above them respectively. The codeUIImageViewcode space the full with and height of the view, and is underneath the toolbars and textInputs.p  pSee here for a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BVyqP0WP7X9YTNGQWNVLWg3VWcviewuspsharing relnofollowscreenshots of Storyboard and appap  pThe user is able to select an image from their Album, or take a photo with their camera, to populate the codeUIImageViewcode. The codeUIImageViewcode is then set to codeAspect Fitcode to keep its correct aspect ratio. p  pI have setup constraints in Interface Builder so that the codeUITextFieldscode are positioned at a constant distance to the top and bottom toolbars. p  pThe problem I have is that the user needs to rotate the device to position the text fields so that they are positioned on the top and bottom of the image. What I mean by this is that if the user selects a landscape image, and the device is in portrait, the user would need to rotate their device to ensure that the text fields are positioned on top of the image.p  pWhat I would like to do is reposition the textFields after the user has selected or taken an image and the image has had Aspect Fit applied.p  pIt has been suggested that I could use codeAVMakeRectWithAspectRatioInsidecode to produce a codeCGRectcode with the same dimensions of the codeUIImagecode after it has has Aspect Fit applied, use the CGRect to update the frame of the codeUIImageViewcode, and then update the constraints.p  pI have managed to produce the new codeCGRectcode and update the frame of the codeUIImageViewcode. I have then changed my constraints on the codeUITextFieldscode so that they align with the codeUIImageViewcode instead of the toolbar however the codeUITextFieldscode dont reposition themselves when the frame is updated.p  pI call the following after the frame has been updatedp  precodeview.setNeedUpdateConstraints codepre  pIf anyone has an idea at the best way to approach this problem that would be great.p  pstrongEDITstrong p  pHere is the code from the viewController in project I have created to isolate and try to solve this issue..p  precodeimport UIKit import AVFoundation  class ViewController UIViewController       IBOutlet weak var imageViewPic UIImageView     IBOutlet weak var topTextToToolberContraint NSLayoutConstraint     IBOutlet weak var bottomTextToToolbarConstraint NSLayoutConstraint     IBOutlet weak var topText UILabel     IBOutlet weak var bottomText UILabel      override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad           override func viewWillAppearanimated Bool          let imageToDisplay  UIImagenamed CaptainPicardFacepalm         imageViewPic.image  imageToDisplay           func updateFrame                  let resizedImageSize  imageViewPic.image.size         let imageViewBounds  imageViewPic.bounds         let newRect  AVMakeRectWithAspectRatioInsideRectresizedImageSize, imageViewBounds         imageViewPic.frame  newRect           override func willRotateToInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation UIInterfaceOrientation, duration NSTimeInterval          updateFrame         view.setNeedsLayout       codepre

Negative 5062 plets suppose I have two monads codeFcode and codeMcode Scalazstyle and a function codef A gt F[B]code. Id like to create a function codeg A gt F[M[B]]code that applies f first then binds F monad with codepure[M]code. An example for claritys sakep  precode here, F  Option and M  List import scalaz.syntax.monad. import scalaz.std.list.  def fx Int Option[Int]  Somex def gx Int Option[List[Int]]  fx.mapt gt Listt codepre  pHere, implementation of codegcode is using the inner monad codeListcode constructor explicitly. I could avoid that as followsp  precodedef g2[M[] Monad]x Int Option[M[Int]]  fx.map.pure[M] codepre  pNow, the question is I have a function that expects something like codegcode so a function value of codeInt gt Option[List[Int]]code and something like codefcode in my hands. How do I feed one to another To put it plainlyp  precodedef fx Int Option[Int]  ... def callMeh Int gt Option[List[Int]]  ... I can of course do that callMet gt ft.map.point[List]  How it without lambda expression callMef.kindOfALift[List] callMef andThen  codepre  pThe problem here can be of course abstracted to support not only codeInt gt Option[Int]code but codeA gt M[B]code in general, but thats the easy part. The hard part for me is wrapping the result into an inner monad. The next step is to make it work on transformed monads so instead of having a monad codeMcode itll be cool to get it work with codeMTcode monad transformer. Any hintsp
Negative 5062 pI would like to create a promise in R programmatically. I know that the language supports it. But for some reason, there does not seem a way to do this. p  pTo give more detail I would like to have components of a list lazily evaluated. E.g.p  precodex lt listnodei, childrenpromisesomeexpensivefunctioni codepre  pI only want to access the second component of the list for very few values of the list. Prepopulating the list with lazy expressions results in very clear, compact and readable code. The background of this algorithm is a tree search. Essentially, I am trying to emulate coroutine behaviour here. Right now I am using closures for this, but the code lacks elegancy. p  pIs there a thirdparty package that exposes the hidden promise construction mechanism in R Or is this mechanism explicitly tied to environment bindings rather than expressionsp  pP.S. Yes, I am aware of delayedAssign. It does not do what I want. Yes, I can juggle around with intermediate environments, but its also messy. p
