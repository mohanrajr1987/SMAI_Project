Positive 2816 pIm going to develop an android app which needs very high efficiency even with a heavy weight database. in that case, i thought of having a hybrid database which include both SQL lite and noSQL. Is it possible to do thisp  pIf possible, I need to know what is the best no SQL for my task.

Positive 2816 pI have an app that manages prospects. These prospects are assigned to some collaborators. They have a tablet that they use to contact our clients. The mobile app has offline support and syncs with the desktop app. I have some users that manages this collaborators and they need to have access to all prospects from their collaborators.p  pOur current design is a cordova app, with angular and pouchdb that syncs to couchdb. The desktop app is a laravel app. We create a new couchdb database for every collaborator that syncs with their account on mobile app.  The admins and supervisors needs to access, list and edit all prospects of all couchdb databases. So, we sync through a nodejs process, all prospects on  couchdb databases to mysql prospects table, so we can easily list all prospects.p  pMy question is if this design makes sense or if we should go for another way.p  pThere is a similar question and design a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32030347cordovawebappusingpouchdbcouchdbschemadesign32206581comment5359525332206581hereap

Positive 2816 pIs there anyway to have a Role Based Access Control user management mechanism for a javascript app that uses couchDb as the database backend According to what I have been looking into, when it comes to security all the talks are about setting up different users for the couchDb instance itself, rather than having user and role information inside one database that belongs to a specific application.p  pIn addition, I would like to know how does authentication and rolebased authorization work if you have perapp, indatabase user amp role information Is there a tokenbased authentication way or whatp
Positive 2816 pWe are looking at load balancing our CouchDB databases. The strategy of having one primary database that handles only writes, and multiple replicas that handle only reads, seems like a good solution to me. This site explains it pretty wellbr a hrefhttpswww.safaribooksonline.comlibraryviewscalingcouchdb9781449304942ch04.html relnofollowhttpswww.safaribooksonline.comlibraryviewscalingcouchdb9781449304942ch04.htmlap  pHowever, I have this one nagging thought. If writes only go to the primary, and reads are only from the replicas, is it possible that a user could cause an update to their data and not see it right away because of the latency of the replication This sounds like it could happen every time, if the read comes quickly after the write.p  pWould it be useful or even work to include the primary in the list of servers that can read Or would that be useless, or even break things worsep

Positive 2816 pIm running CouchDB with Yocto Dizzy on a LogicPD Torpedo with a 1GHz processor. I have multiple Android devices connected, making changes, and syncing with this database through some Java and Nodejs code. For the most part, it looks like the database is replicating properly across all devices. p  pHowever, I do have a frequent issue where a device will fall out of sync and the Android app on that device will have to be restarted. By fall out of sync I mean that changes are being made on one device, synced to the database, and not showing up on another device.

Positive 2816 pI have CouchDB servers behind a load balancer. It is required to track the requests being made to the web server and the source of the request. When the INFO level logging is enabled all the requests are logged but the source IP is that of the load balancer. When the DEBUG mode logging is enabled, the actual source IP of the request is visible in the Clienthost field in the logs.p  pThe DEBUG is too verbose and may fill up the disks pretty quickly.p  pIs there a way to get all the access logged along with the actual source IP Clienthost without enabling DEBUG.p
Positive 2816 pI am new to Cloudant but have found it useful for a first stage of IoT data. But I need to subscribe to changes based on an id field that is separate from the id and is unique to the sensor that is sending the data. The examples that Ive seen so far havent helped with this problem. What Im doing now is sending a separate json doc for each post, so it should return new docs with this sensor id. The json docs sometimes come in by the second but it can be hours as well.p  pIm using c in a .Net web app. The code below creates a call to the Cloudant database and returns the data that I want based on an index that was created for the field SensorID,p  precodejson     selector      SensorID  h7365cf317bc4422b436f7bcf12b2e2a   ,   fields [     Data   ]   url  My Cloudant url   find.  codepre  pThis returns all docs with the sensorID field that corresponds to the SensorID value in the json query, but just the json object of each doc nested in the Data field.p  precodeusing WebClient client  new WebClient                              byte[] postBytes    System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.UTF8.GetBytesjson.ToString                 client.UseDefaultCredentials  true                 client.Credentials  new NetworkCredentialusername, password                  client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.ContentType]  applicationjson                  var response  client.UploadDataurl, POST, postBytes                 JObject  iJson      JObject.Parseclient.Encoding.GetStringresponse                  return parseIncomingiJson               codepre  pWhen the call is to My Cloudant url  GET DBUPDATES, it returns information regarding changes to the whole database. This can be set up as a continuous feed.p  pI was hoping that this meant that i could subscribe to changes in documents to get new data coming, like Redis PubSub. Im starting to think that this might not be the case, but if anybody can show me how to do it I would be grateful.p

Positive 2816 pI am coming to you for advices about modelling data for a webapp, I decided to go with couchdb  pouchdb cordova app.p  pstrongWhystrong because of the replication mecanism that seems pretty convenient to implement. Seems like I wont even need to use some server programming languages. If I am not wrong, javascript can manage the whole thing.p  pHowever, there is a slight problem like most of people, I come from relationnal database and what would seems pretty easy to implement in MySQL is giving me some headhache with the documents logic.p  pstrongBasic requirementstrong users can browse a list of movies splited by type. When viewing the description of a movie, a user can decide if yes or not he wants to see it. So when each user is seeing a list of movies, some would be tagged as something like must watch.p  pA relationnal DB would give me something likep  precodeUSERemail, firstname, name MOVIES id, title, duration, description, type TOWATCH email, id codepre  pUsing couchDB, what would be the best way to implement this  Something like below p  precodeuser this document would be created and updated directly through an app     id  email of the user,     firstname  firstname,     name  name,     movies           id id of a movie        movies this document would be created and updated directly through the server     id  unique id of a movie,     title  title of the movie,     duration  duration of the movie,     description  duration of a movie     type  kind of movie  codepre  pWhat do you think p

Negative 2816 pI have a web site which I download 23 MB of raw data from that then feeds into an ETL process to load it into my data mart. Unfortunately the data provider is the US Dept. of Ag USDA and they do not allow downloading via FTP. They require that I use a web form to select the elements I want, click through 23 screens and eventually click to download the file. Id like to automate this download process. I am not a web developer but somehow it seems that I should be able to use some tool to tell me exactly what putgetmagic goes from the final request to the server. If I had a tool that said, pass these parameters to this url and wait for a response I could then hack something together in Perl to automate this process. p  pI realize that if I deconstructed all 5 of their pages and read through the JavaScript includes and tapped my heals together 3 times I could get this info from what I have access to. But I want a faster and more direct path that does not require me to manually parse all their JS. p  pRestatement of the final question Is there a tool or method that will show clearly what the final request request sent from a web form was and how it was structured p

Negative 2816 pIve been extensively using smart pointers boostsharedptr to be exact in my projects for the last two years. I understand and appreciate their benefits and I generally like them a lot. But the more I use them, the more I miss the deterministic behavior of C with regarding to memory management and RAII that I seem to like in a programming language. Smart pointers simplify the process of memory management and provide automatic garbage collection among other things, but the problem is that using automatic garbage collection in general and smart pointer specifically introduces some degree of indeterminisim in the order of deinitializations. This indeterminism takes the control away from the programmers and, as Ive come to realize lately, makes the job of designing and developing APIs, the usage of which is not completely known in advance at the time of development, annoyingly timeconsuming because all usage patterns and corner cases must be well thought of.p  pTo elaborate more, Im currently developing an API. Parts of this API requires certain objects to be initialized before or destroyed after other objects. Put another way, the order of deinitialization is important at times. To give you a simple example, lets say we have a class called System. A System provides some basic functionality logging in our example and holds a number of Subsystems via smart pointers.p  precodeclass System  public     boostsharedptrlt Subsystem gt GetSubsystem unsigned int index           assert index lt mSubsystems.size          return mSubsystems[ index ]           void LogMessage const stdstringamp message           stdcout ltlt message ltlt stdendl       private     typedef stdvectorlt boostsharedptrlt Subsystem gt gt SubsystemList     SubsystemList mSubsystems       class Subsystem  public     Subsystem System pParentSystem            mpParentSystem pParentSystem             Subsystem           pParentSubsystemgtLogMessage Destroying...            Destroy this subsystem deallocate memory, release resource, etc.                              Other stuff here       private     System  pParentSystem  raw pointer to avoid cycles  can also use weakptrs  codepre  pAs you can already tell, a Subsystem is only meaningful in the context of a System. But a Subsystem in such a design can easily outlive its parent System.p  precodeint main               boostsharedptrlt Subsystem gt pSomeSubsystem                      boostsharedptrlt System gt pSystem new System              pSomeSubsystem  pSystemgtGetSubsystem  some index              Our System would go out of scope and be destroyed here, but the Subsystem that pSomeSubsystem points to will not be destroyed.         pSomeSubsystem would go out of scope here but wait a second, how are we going to log messages in Subsystems destructor Its parent System is destroyed after all. BOOM      return 0  codepre  pIf we had used raw pointers to hold subsystems, we would have destroyed subsystems when our system had gone down, of course then, pSomeSubsystem would be a dangling pointer. p  pAlthough, its not the job of an API designer to protect the client programmers from themselves, its a good idea to make the API easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly. So Im asking you guys. What do you think How should I alleviate this problem How would you design such a systemp  pThanks in advance, Joshp

Negative 2816 pI am writing a concurrent, persistent message queue in C, which requires concurrent read access to a file without using memory mapped io. Short story is that several threads will need to read from different offsets of the file.p  pOriginally I had a file object that had typical readwrite methods, and threads would acquire a mutex to call those methods. However, it so happened that I did not acquire the mutex properly somewhere, causing one thread to move the file offset during a readwrite, and another thread would start readingwriting to an incorrect part of the file.p  pSo, the paranoid solution is to have one open file handle per thread. Now Ive got a lot of file handles to the same file, which Im assuming cant be great.p  pId like to use something like a hrefhttplinux.about.comlibrarycmdblcmdl25Fpread.htm relnofollowpreada, which allows passing in of the current offset to readwrite functions.p  pHowever, the function is only available on linux, and I need equivalent implementations on windows, aix, solaris and hpux, any suggestionsp
Negative 2816 pI am trying to pass keyboard input from Javascript into a Flex app being displayed with Internet Explorer with the input language set to Japanese using Full Katakana in the Windows XP language bar.  After an initial keystroke, I am passing focus from Javascript to a text field in Flex.  Once the focus is in Flex, the IME wakes up and input of the Japanese characters behaves normally.  Unfortunately, the initial keystroke does not make it into the IME editor, and so I was hoping to pass along the unicode key value for the keystroke.  The keyDown event in Javascript is reporting only 229 for the keyCode, and 0 for the charCode.  Any ideas about getting a usable key or char code in Javascript while using Japanese inputp  pThanks, Philipp
Negative 2816 pI am creating a .NET MVC application and I have a view in which I want to display the followingp  pstrongCategorystrongp  pfollowed by a list of strongitemsstrong for the current Categoryp  p[possibly] followed by a list of strongsub itemsstrong for the current itemp  pI could create a custom ViewModel class that sends 3 separate IEnumerable lists categories, items, and sub items.  The problem with this approach is there is no easy way to render the data in the proper order hierarchy in the view.

This would mean that each item list would be iterated multiple times as I try to slot the items into the proper positions on the page.p  pI would rather pass back the data in the proper order, perhaps as an XML file.

Negative 2816 pI am using a simple Perl script to parse XML and convert it to usable SQL. My current SQL lines go something like this p  precodeINSERT INTO table VALUES data1, data2, data3,   codepre  pObviously I need to remove the comma at the end there. Sounds simple but I just cant get regex to find it. I tried codes,scode but that doesnt change anything when I run it. Strangely, codes,sWTFcode doesnt modify anything either, when it should be replacing all the commas and the spaces next to them. BUT when I run codesssomethingcode it correctly finds and replaces the close parentheses at the end of the line. So apparently the whitespace character right after the commas is some strange ghost character that I cant find by any means. Not even with the code.code expression.p  pWhats really weird though is when I use Find on the document in Notepad with the Regular Expression option, it finds all of them perfectly when I enter code,scode yet the exact same sequence in Perl regex will not find them.p  pI suspected it was something with codercode Im using Windows since I previously removed the codencode characters but it wont find a codercode in the whole sql file.p  pThank you in advance for your help this is really puzzling me.p
Negative 2816 pExtract from CLR via C on Boxing  Unboxing value types ...p  pOn Boxing If the nullable instance is not strongnullstrong, the CLR takes the value out of the nullable instance and boxes it. In other words a strongNullable lt Int32 strong with a value of strong5strong is boxed into a strongboxedInt32strong with a value of 5.p  pOn Unboxing Unboxing is simply the act of obtaining a reference to the unboxed portion of a boxed object. The problem is that a boxed value type cannot be simply unboxed  into a nullable version of that value type because the boxed value doesnt have the strongboolean hasValuestrong field in it. So, when unboxing a value type into a nullable version, the CLR must allocate a strongNullable lt T strong object, initialize the stronghasValuestrong field to strongtruestrong, and set the strongvaluestrong field to the same value that is in the boxed value type. This impacts your application performance memory allocation during unboxing.p  pstrongWhy did the CLR team go through so much trouble for Nullable types   Why was it not simply boxed into a Nullable lt Int32  in the first place strong p

I used a combination of WinDbg and perfmon to track the memory use over time from a couple hours to days. The total number of bytes on all CLR heaps does not increase by more than I expect, but the total number of private bytes steadily increases as more messages are logged. This makes WinDbg less useful, as its tools sos and commands dumpheap, gcroot, etc. are based on .NETs managed memory.p  pThis is likely why GC.Collect can not help me, as it is only looking for free memory on the CLR heap. My leak appears to be in unmanaged memory.p

Negative 2816 pWe transferred our existing website which is running on a Server 2003 machine using iis6 and coded with classic asp to a Server 2008 64 bit machine using iis7 and classic asp.  The only changes to the pages were for our calls to a Universe db, which need a new connection string .  We tested all the pages within the department running 45 users and all went well.  When we made it live for everyone between 40 and 100 users users were losing their session variables some immediately and others after 3 minutes.p  pIs there a setting in iis7 that could be throttling the amout of memory allotted for session variables  Or does anyone have any other ideas as to what may be happening.

Negative 2816 pI know there are some similar questions around in Stackoverflow, but they were either .Net related or didnt have any answer that helped us.p  pThe case is as follows with some friends we are starting an open source project. While setting the foundations of the hopefully successful project, a question arose how to enforce the code conventions of the projectp  pThe reasoning is that being an open source project, if people starts reformatting the code as they like, the patches will become cluttered with changes due to formatting that will hide the real value of the patch. So we want something that forces users to abide to a specific formatting, breaking the build if they dont. p  pThe project is using Struts 2  Spring  Hibernate, using Maven 2 thinking on moving to Maven 3. We know we can use CheckStyle to test the Java files, but this leaves some questions open that hopefully someone can answerp  ul liThere is some tool to check the style of XML and SQL files, breaking the build if they dont abide to the rulesli liThere is some tool that automatically reformats the source files Java, XML, SQL to the desired convention Can ti be integrated with Maven somehowli ul  pWe could find Jalopy for Java files, but we would prefer a free tool as far as we know, the latest version is paid one. And we still couldnt find anything for SQLXML.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong just to make it clear Im not asking about PMD, Checkstyle or these tools. Im asking for tools thatp  ul liAutomatically format SQL, XML andor Java files to a desired coding convention 4 spaces, etcli liDetect SQL and XML files with the wrong format and break a build because of that.li ul

Negative 2816 pI have just been asked by my company to rewrite a largish 50,000 single lines of code Java application a web app using JSP and servlets in Clojure. Has anyone else got tips as to what I should watch out forp  pPlease bear in mind that I know both Java AND Clojure quite well.p  h2Updateh2  pI did the rewrite and it went into production. Its quite strange as the rewrite ended up going so fast that it was done in about 6 weeks. Because alot of functionality wasnt needed still it ended up more like 3000 lines of Clojure. I hear they are happy with the system and its doing exactly what they wanted. The only downside is that the guy maintaining the system had to learn Clojure from scratch, and he was dragged into it kicking and screaming. I did get a call from him the other day saying he loved Lisp now though.. funny p  pAlso, I should give a good mention to Vaadin. Using Vaadin probably accounted for as much of the time saved and shortness of the code as Clojure did.. Vaadin is still the top web framework I have ever used, although now Im learning ClojureScript in anger Note that both Vaadin and ClojureScript use Googles GUI frameworks underneath the hoodp

Negative 2816 pIm new to Corona and as a learning exercise Im creating a simple game of keepie uppie httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKeepieuppie using the Corona SDK physics engine.p  pI have all aspects working correctly, except the ball motion on kick.

This is despite the force being applied at the point of contact on the ball. p  pI have come up with the following workaroundp  precodefunction balltouch event          only allow taps in bottom half of ball      if  event.y gt ball.y and event.phase  began  then            temporarily move floor to just below ball          floor.y  ball.y  ballSize           local flipx  0           ifevent.x gt ball.x then              flipx  event.x  ballSize          elseifevent.x lt ball.x then              flipx  event.x  ballSize          else              flipx  event.x          end           ballapplyLinearImpulse 0, kickForce, flipx, event.y       end end codepre  pThe above works by temporarily moving the floor position to just under the ball before the force is applied the floor is then moved back to the correct position via an enterFrame event listener.p  pI also found that with this solution I had to flip the x position of the event touch, or it would otherwise bounce horizontally opposite to the expected direction.p  pThe above is clearly not ideal. Should I be stopping the ball motion before applying the force and, if so, how Or am I taking the wrong approach completelyp

Negative 2816 pIve been relying on IoC pattern for 1 year now using structuremap amp asp.net mvc. IoC is really neat especially if you have a lot of dependencies in your class, just inject dependency in your constructor and your done, the IoC will autoinject it for you.p  pMy question is that im using asp.net mvc with a controller class which have IServices dependencies.p  pI need the dependency services only for a certain controller action let say customeradd but i dont need those dependency on other action let say CustomerIndex. However, since im using a DI Dependency injection in constructor, the dependency are always instantiated even if i dont need them. Is that any good object creation is expensive and consume memory footprint.p  pOf course, i can do container.GetInstance inside an action, but it is not a good practice since you will heavily be dependent on IoC in your code and unit testing.p  pAny suggestion correct me if im wrong with something.p

When running on the production server I get results back about 30 of the time, on my laptop with only 4 GiB of RAM and a regular 2.5 spinning rust hard drive its closer to 10.p  pSo, is there any way for me to either speed this up or is my best bet to just up the timeout and leave it running for weeks until it is finished Ive considered just building a data fetcher program that just dumps the results into a separate table along the lines ofp  precodeCREATE TABLE     id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,     keyword VARCHAR255 NOT NULL,     returneddata VARCHARMAX,  Or possibly a TEXT field.  codepre  pThat way I could leave the fetcher program running and just have my main program query this table. But honestly, Id rather just figure out a way of making the queries run faster or another way of making the queries. I just really hope Im being a dummy and that Ive missed out on some obvious way to make this run faster...p

This is just sheer curiosity, so please humour me p  pI know that if a C program opens a bunch of files and never closes any of them, eventually fopen will start failing. Are there any other side effects that could cause problems outside the code itself For instance, if I have a program that opens one file, and then exits without closing it, could that cause a problem for the person running the program Would such a program leak anything memory, file handles Could there be problems accessing that file again once the program had finished What would happen if the program was run many times in successionp

Yes, our special language format in the text file can be parsed into a tree structure. And so far I can see the correct structural differences of two files in the tree view in the upper part of the whole comparing window. p  pstrongHowever, my problem is that when I double click a tree node, it does not bring up the differences of the nodes in the two panes in the lower part of window.strong It just displays nothing, not like when comparing two java files in the eclipse.p  pI think this problem has something to do with the shared document as the guide saysp  blockquote   pFor text based inputs, clients should subclass the StructureCreator   class. This will enable the use of a shared document between multiple   editors open on the same file. Subclasses of StructureCreator that   provide syntax highlighting must implement both the   getDocumentPartitioner and getDocumentPartitioning90 methods to   support shared documents.p blockquote  pHowever, I dont know where went wrong. Do I need to extend more extension points such as codestructureMergeViewerscode to make it work or just to add more stuff in the subclass of codeStructureCreatorcode to make it right p  pAnd If I want to support syntax highlighting, What more things do I need to do the above quoted instructions are too simple to follow. p  pI wish some eclipse dev experts with such experience can help me with this. Thanksp

Negative 2816 pI have a batch of animation calls, invoked by iterating through an array. All these calls are nested within an encapsulating animation block so that they execute effectively in parallel.  I also have a completion block with I only want to fire once all of the nested animations have completed.br The problem is that the nested animations are of unknown durations, so I cannot simply calculate which call will be the last to finish and set the completion block on this call.  Similarly I cannot calculate the duration and use a delayed invocation on the completion block. brHopefully an example will make this clearer.

Negative 2816 pSome of our customers have chimed in about a perceived XSS vulnerability in all of our JSONP endpoints, but I disagree as to whether or not it actually constitutes a vulnerability.

Could be used to steal cookies and submit them to the attackers site, or even to generate a fake login screen for phishing.  User checks the domain and sees that its one he trusts, so he goes agead and logs in.p  pBut, in our case, were setting the content type header to codeapplicationjavascriptcode which causes various different behaviors in different browsers.  i.e. Firefox just displays the raw text, whereas IE opens up a save as... dialog.  I dont consider either of those to be particularly exploitable.  The Firefox user isnt going to read malicious text telling him to jump off a bridge and think much of it.  And the IE user is probably going to be confused by the save as dialog and hit cancel.p  pI guess I could see a case where the IE user is tricked into saving and opening the .js file, which then goes through the microsoft JScript engine and gets all sorts of access to the users machine but that seems unlikely.  Is that the biggest threat here or is there some other vulnerability that I missedp  pObviously Im going to fix by putting in filtering to only accept a valid javascript identifier, with some length limit justincase but I just wanted a dialog about what other threats I might have missed.p

The following code is working as long as the output is not too big, but once it is it just ends with a truncated log file.p  precodeimport logging, subprocess  def popenlogcommandL, logFile     p  subprocess.PopencommandL, shellFalse, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE     stdout, stderr  p.communicate     create logger     logger  logging.getLogger     logger.setLevellogging.DEBUG      create file handler which logs even debug messages     fh  logging.FileHandlerlogFile     fh.setLevellogging.DEBUG      create formatter and add it to the handlers     formatter  logging.Formatterasctimes  levelnames  messages     fh.setFormatterformatter     logger.addHandlerfh     logger.infostdout     logger.errorstderr     logger.removeHandlerfh  popenlog[script1.py, i, inputFolder], test.log codepre  pIt certainly has something to do with the streaming of the stdout and stderror to the log file or with the buffering but I just cannot figure out how to do so.

Negative 2816 pPHP  MVC question  So this is a pretty high level question about building an MVC. I have a class called page, and it needs to pull in classes for the model, view, and controller. There is also a Route class that has mostly attributes regarding the Path ClassMethodarg1arg2 , etc p  pRight now the Page pulls in that Route object as its constructor param. p  pShould Model, View and Controller extend Page  Whihle M,V,ampC need certain information from the Route object, I dont think that logically a Model for instance extends a Page  because while its a part of a page, its not a different kind of page, and Im not sure the M,V, amp C need to be that intimate with each other. p  pBut I thought Id ask anyway. What Im finding myself doing is the Page will pass that Route object to the controller when it instantiates it, then the same with the Model, View, etc. p  pI know every time you find yourself doing redundant things like this, it might be time to step back and rethink before you do too much work down that path. p  pBut again, in my mind, the M,V, amp C are not forms of a page, its more a composition thing. p  pThoughts p  pThanksp

Negative 2816 pI am working on a google apps script that is being published as a service, and accessed by multiple users via the UI.p  pThe problem Im having is that when one user causes a UserProperty to be set, all the users subsequently have their UserProperty set to that also. In other words it is acting like a ScriptProperty, rather than a UserProperty, in that it is not User specific. All users appear to cause this to happen.p  pI have studies my code and I just cannot see that it is anything to do with that.

Here after parsing every character I can call isWord method already implemented and then if it is keep going to the next character and increase the word length, if its not then simply reset the counter to zero and start looking for a word from that index.

If it tries running it again while the trimming process is still taking place, then the server will ignore that request, and the script will keep running as if nothing has gone wrong. What I want it to do, is check the log until it finds that the trim is completed. The log file throughout a trim will look something like thisp  precode20120812 035808 [INFO] World trimming task is ready for world world, trimming the map past 208 blocks beyond the border default 208, and the task will try to process up to 5000 chunks per second default 5000. 20120812 035808 [INFO] This process can take a while depending on the worlds overall size.

Therefore, I cant just tail the last 10 lines of the log and check that, as once 10 lines had passed for example an error that prints more than 10 lines in the interval that the script waits before checking the last 10 lines, its not going to ever going to be able to find anything that would cause it to realize that it finished, so it would wait forever, using up valuable resources and preventing the worlds from being trimmed until I noticed that something is wrong, which could take days, or even weeks to since its automated.p  pNot only would it have to stop when it is completed, only for that world, but it will have to record the hour and minute when it started trimming the world, and only check after that, because if I trimmed the same world earlier it would cause problems otherwise, as there would already be the task successfully completed in the log for that world, which would cause the script to stop almost immediately. Does anyone see a solution to this This makes my head hurt just thinking about it... Pp

Negative 2816 pGreeting all. I come from a C background, but I wanted to give Java a try, and have been reading a book. Now comes the JDK, though. Basically, what I want to do is make it so I can rearrangerename folders, and not make this break. I think the problem is specifically somewhere within the JRE and the JVM  specifically, if I rearrange stuff, it says it cannot fing the jvm.config file, using the path that it had been previously, which is logical  it is no longer there. My question is, how do you CHANGE this behavior so it, eh, works. I found a similar question on a SO site I forget which one, probably here detailing nearly the same problem. It was something about the... installer, perhaps Or something, adding some sort of registry path, as I understand it. JavaHome mabye. The linked to reference, or the answer, however, did not make it clear to me how to fix this. And thus, here I am.p  pFor example, lets say my directory goes kind of like this or, rather, went ...ProgramJava...p  pand within was the jre. I changed the Program to Programming  might be bad practice, but I felt urged to change it. Point is, it no longer worked unless I kept it like it was before. Ideally, I actually want all the JDK related file, including the JRE, all in a JDK folder. And, of course, any other movements I make. How do I fix this path problemp  pThanks if you can help.p

Negative 2816 pWorking on a project for class specific to the college network.p  pThe idea is that if we can fetch an identifying characteristic of the web sessionconnection on campus, we can map out and associate the AP with their location coordinates and plot them on a map. More specifically, were trying to determine which AP the device is connected to. p  pBasically the user would bring up a webpage on the intranet from a wifi enabled device preferably an iPad or iPod Touch, and either on the page load or through an action event an unique identifier is captured which we could in turn associate with lat amp long coordinates. The idea here is that the unique identifier would be sent and stored into to a DB field almost like a guestbook submission. Then, externally on a separate public webpage  viewers would be able to see these unique identifiers returned and translated as the most recently visited locations plotted on a map. This would translate to a manual checkin tracking service. p  pCapturing the IP address will not work as they are not static. p

Negative 2816 pWe have renamed our context root used by Apple MDM, and are now faced with a need to be backward compatible with devices already enrolled. We are running JBossp  pMy first attempt was just to add a second module entry to application.xml with a new context root but the same warfile. I did not work, unless I made a copy of the war file with a new name. I really dont like this solution though it worked.p  pInstead I tried adding a Valve to the root app, which would then redirect for the old context roots to a new one. This also worked very well until a device made a POST, and then the posted binary content was lost.br The benefit of this solution would be that we could establish a new context root preparing it for dealing with MDM for Android and Windows Phone.p  pCould this be done with a forward, and how should it then be implementedp

In environment sort  list nat gt list nat ls  list nat x  nat l  list nat y  nat l0  list nat left  list nat right  list nat Recursive call to sort has principal argument equal to left instead of one of the following variables l l0. Recursive definition is fun ls  list nat gt match ls with  nil gt nil  x  nil gt x  nil  x     gt     let left, right  split ls nil nil in merge sort left sort right end. codepre  pMy interpretation of these errors is that l and l0 are ls without its head, x, and ls without x and the element after x which I guess it decided to call y.  It is mad that I did not recurse on one of these lists and instead recursed on a locally defined list.p  pAm I only allowed to recurse on things that come directly from the pattern match  If yes, this seems like a severe limitation.  Are there ways around it  I am guessing that Coq cant tell that the function will terminate. Is there some way to prove to it that left and right are smaller than xsp

Negative 2816 pI am using a map which seemed the best implementation after a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15016197stdmapintintvsvectorofvectorprevious questiona, with a pair key, as a container for incoming messages that can be sorted according to sourceID and priority i.e. key sourceID, priority which points to an int value. Processing will happen on this map.p  pIve just come against a problem  I need to do something like this pseudo code to subsequently retrieve messagesp  precodemapltpairltint, intgt, intgt mymap  if mymap[makepairnodeID,i].empty i refers to all the priority levels     processing occurs here to retrieve a value codepre  pbut I cant seem to do it easily.

I need to check there there are messages available for any particular destID, regardless of priority level, so I am looking for an easy way to check this.p  pI know that if I use a vector, I will be able to do something like node[2].empty, if I want to check that node 2 has no available messages.

Negative 2816 pIn ASP.NET webapi, I send a temporary file to client. I open a stream to read the file and use the StreamContent on the HttpResponseMessage. Once the client receives the file, I want to delete this temporary file without any other call from the client  Once the client recieves the file, the Dispose method of HttpResponseMessage is called amp the stream is also disposed. Now, I want to delete the temporary file as well, at this point. p  pOne way to do it is to derive a class from HttpResponseMessage class, override the Dispose method, delete this file amp call the base classs dispose method. I havent tried it yet, so dont know if this works for surep  pI want to know if there is any better way to achieve this. p
Negative 2816 pIve been wondering for a time now  in c is there a way to define a template for several properties within a class.

Negative 2816 pI have a main view controller that lists a bunch of items, and when they tap on one of the items it segues them to the next view. However, in the next view, I dont want the navigation bar to be there, I only want it in the first view Im using a UIToolBar for the navigation bar, kind of like a hrefhttpi.imgur.com6GOoT1c.jpg relnofollowin iBooksa.p  pHow exactly do I go about achieving this If I remove the main view controller from the navigation controller completely unembedding, effectively I can implement the nav bars selectively, but this solution doesnt allow segues, so its no good.p  pMy other solution was to call codeself.navigationController.navigationBarHidden  YEScode in codeviewDidAppearcode for the second view, but with this, the UIToolBar that I added in my storyboard is pushed under the navigation bar that hasnt been hidden yet, and then when it does get hidden, it disappears and the UIToolBar falls down, which is a pretty gross effect to the user.p  pWhat would be the best way to go about getting this effectp

Negative 2816 pI cant seem to figure out how to effectively use androids layoutweight attribute. Im trying to create a custom listView that has three textViews. The primary textView resides at the top left, then i have a text view that resides in the top right for, and then the third one that lives underneath the primary textView. Id like the primary and the top right two be on the some horizontal axis but i want the primary textView to take up about 70 of the width, while the other textView takes the remaining 30.

Negative 2816 pI am aware that if I instantiate a template such asp  precodetemplateltint igt int ReturnMeDouble      return 2  i  codepre  pThen the compiler needs to be able to evaluate the value of i at compile time.  My problem is dumbed down for simplicity that I want my program to call one of two functions depending on a variable.  My code looks something like thisp  precodeint returnValue  0 switchvalue      case 1     case 2     case 3     case 4         returnValue  ReturnMeDoubleltvaluegt         break     case 5     case 6         returnValue  ReturnMeTripleltvaluegt         break  codepre  pThe real ReturnMe... functions do something less trivial.  Now obviously, I could use this switch statement and provide individual calls under each case statement, but I was just wondering if there was something Im missing, since it seems obvious to me if not to the compiler that in the first case, ReturnMeDouble can only be called with one of four values.  p  pIs it simply that the compiler would have to put in a conditional flow around the four separate function templates that would need instantiating effectively what Im trying to avoid doing manually and it doesnt know how top  pIs there a more elegant way of doing thisp  pEdit  To clarify  the less trivial implementation uses the integer value to apply some metaprograms for type selection within the function.p

Negative 2816 pYes,this is yet another question around icons in Xcode with Cordova.I have spent most of the day trying to track down the cause of these issues and have acted on everything Ive found but the errors keep coming.  There seems to be an issue aroundThe capitalization of the i in icon,along with how that filename is passed to Xcode,and the caching thereof.There is a further and more fundamental error that just seems to be a plain bug.This is what I do after receiving the codeunable to verify icon dimensions, no icon foundcode p  perror 1.Delete the archive 2.Product  clean 3.Product  archive. 4.Check Resources should be in resources  icons, where resources is in the folder on the same level as the codeproj folder, right. 5.Check Build phases for any items in red. Delete if I find any. 6. Organizer  Archives. This is the interesting bit  so long as my icons begin with lowercase i, Ill see my big icon in the organizer window. If a change the icon name to begin with a capital I which is what most people suggest,that icon doesnt appear.But the error message is always the same, and refers to Icon.png for example, not icon.png. Apologies for the length, and please dont suggest anything thats already been suggested seriously, Ive tried them all, and its doing my head in.Many thanks in advance.p

Negative 2816 pThis is a terrible idea, but im seeing if its even feasible before I walk down this road. p  pI have to write a Win32 C program that can dynamically load a library based on a file that has serialized information on what dll, function, signature, and arguements to use. Loading the library is trivial LoadLibraryEx works fine.  Then getting the function pointer is easy not a big deal, the GetProcAdderss takes care of this. However the rest is tricky. p  pHeres my plan of attack, feel free to let me know if this isnt the best approachp  ol liOpen the serialized information from a file on what DLL to load, and what function to execute.li liLoadLibraryEx to bring in the DLLli liGetProcAddress to get the function pointer after casting the byte array to a stringli liWrite the arguments which are read in as a byte array to memory in bytes.li liGet the address to the beginning of each argument ill know from serialization what the size of each argument is.li liUsing assembly jump to the beginning of the function pointer, push the addresses on the heap to the arguments in the stack in reverse order.li liExecute and get back the return value address as a void  li liUse the memory address of the return value that I got from assembly and the size which I got from the serialization of the return type value and write the raw bytes back to a file.li ol  pKeep in mind my limitationsp  ol liI will never know except for runtime what the signature, dll, function name is.li liIt is always read in from a file.li ol  pIs there a better approach, will this approach even workp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pFor anyone who comes poking in this thread to learn more, I found a solution. In C you can dynamically load a library using dlopen theres a winlib of this for ease of use. Once loaded you can dynamically execute functions using libffi supports macioswin 64 and 32bit. This only gets you to C functions and primitive types pointer,uint,int,double,float and thats about it. However using macosx objectivec bridge you can access objectivec by loading libobjc osxs native objc to c toll free bridge. Then through that dynamically create objc and c classes.  A similar technique can be done on windows using C and its marshaling capabilities.p  pThis ends up with HIGH overhead, and you must be VERY careful about your memory, in addition dont mix pointers from CCC. Finally, whatever you do, at runtime. BE ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU KNOW YOUR TYPES.... seriously.  BTW, libfficinvoke, amazing libraries.p

We build this view placing those subviews in some positions. br Now we need to build another subviews that contains a number of buttons as subviews contentView which number is given at runtime.br The algorithm will pick the size of this content view and put the correct number of buttons calculating the space between them in a way that the will be at the same distance from each other but covering the whole content view width. For example, the contentView is 200 point in width, buttons are 3 and squared with a side of 60. Together they cover 180, so we have 20 points left that should be placed as a space between the buttons10 points. br Thats pretty easy, made thousand of times before auto layout. To do that I need the width of the contentView which has some constraints to its superview that make it resize its width according to superview size, the problem is that I cant find any place inside UIView implementation where I can get the final value of the size of the contentView.br I tried view codelayoutSubviewscode, codeupdateConstraintscode, codedidMoveToSuperviewcode, value show are alway the original one. When the new frames are calculatedbr I clearly didnt get something about auto layout...br brbr br I discovered this problem trying to set table view cell height, trying to make them appear all on screen independently by the size of the table view. here is the related question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17122284autolayoutinuiviewwhereissafetoaskcomputedlayoutvaluesother questionap

Join mercurial subrepositories into one strongMainstrong mercurial repository with preserving the full history 2.

Negative 2816 pSuppose i have 3 view controllers. I initiate vc1 in vc0 and then vc2 in vc1. Now i want vc2 to be dismissed and after that only vc0 should be shown behind it. Hows that possible I read something about delegate declaration. But couldnt understand. p  pI have UISegmentcontrol where im displaying a controller from storyboard like  vc0  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifiervc0] and making it a subview of it [self.view addSubviewvc0.view] Vc0 is a tableView, which has a detailcontroller to be presented. When i tap on a cell, it shows detailview, but actual segmentcontrol.view is lost when detailview is dismissed.p  pAn example would be awesome. p  pPS Im not using segue for the viewControllers. Instead, im using presentModalViewController and dismissModalViewController. p

Negative 2816 pIve written a SON manipulator to encode some custom objects into mongo following a hrefhttpapi.mongodb.orgpythoncurrentexamplescustomtype.html relnofollowhttpapi.mongodb.orgpythoncurrentexamplescustomtype.htmla.  This works brilliantly for encoding and decoding the objects on their way into and out of the collection, but as far as I can tell, theres no way to use it in a query.  If I try to query using an object which can be encoded using the manipulator, I get the same codecannot encode objectcode error that you get if you try to insert the object directly without using the manipulator.  However, I can obviously query perfectly if I manually encode the object into the query.  Is there a neat way to use the SON manipulator in queries without resorting to manually encoding the objectp

Negative 2816 pI am working with a treePanel with ExtJS 4.2.1. My problem is quite delicate to explain.p  pI have two buttons, a tree button and a clear button.p  pWhen I click my tree button, it shows a treePanel with checkNodes so you can check some nodes. I have a valid button in my treepanel to valid the selection. Once you have clicked this button, the checked nodes precisely leaves but that is a detail will be added to a panel. This panel is a grid and its the list of the nodes you have checked. No problem with this grid. I dont have any problem with this button and my grid, and when I click the valid button the checked nodes are correctly listed in my grid panel.p  pWhen I click the clear button, which is not in my tree panel it clears all my selection, my grid becomes empty and all the nodes from my tree becomes unchecked like if you were starting from the beginning.p  pIt works when I do it for the first time. I can check nodes, click on the valid button and it will correctly add my items to my grid panel I never have any problem with my grid panel which list my checked nodes. If I click my clear button the list becomes empty. Then if I click on my tree button, the tree panel appears and if I expand it I can see that the selection is reinitialized, all the nodes are unchecked.p  pTHE PROBLEM  if I do the same operation a second time it seems to work great, but the tree panel is not visualy reinitialised. I click on the tree button, the treepanel appears and when I expand it I see that the nodes I precedently checked are still checked. The problem is that when I want to consult my checked nodes with some codeconsole.logcurrentChild.data.checkedcode I can see that the checked value is codefalsecode.p  pSo it seems to work with the data, but my tree panel is not correctly refreshed only when I do the operation more than one time.p  pI dont know if my problem is correctly explained.

Negative 2816 pOk I have found a couple of resources that have tried to load two datasources using d3js.  Unfortunately they dont seem to solve the problem I having.p  pEssentially what I am trying to do is create a force layout with nodes and links and have the ability to change datasources via a selection from a drop down menu.p  pHere are the basics...I retrieve all nodes and links from and external file using d3.json.  Everything works perfectly and I have even animated the visualization to cycle through the different dates for each node.  My problem is, now I am trying to expand on the functionality of this visualization...I want to be able to select a .json file from a dropdown menu and then reload the visualization with the new data.  Basically providing the user to view several different visualizations of completely different data.p  pAll the concepts appear to be working except for when I redraw the visualization using the new data file, some nodes appear and float off on their own not linking to the the original node.  I forgot the first 7 nodes I have hard coded their x, y coordinates to be in the middle of the visualization and every node after that uses the force functionality to place themselves depending on what they are linked to.p  pHere is some codep  precode    customer.changefunction  this is the dropdown menu      customer optionselected.eachfunction           var line  d3.selectAllline.remove  remove all links on screen         var g  d3.selectAllg.remove  remove all nodes on screen         dataFile  this.innerHTML  changes variable used in d3.json          change  calls function wrapper that contains d3.json           function change         d3.jsondataFile, functionfileData             rtm  new Object  initialize dictionary object             dates  []  initialize dates[] array to contain all dates in data              var node    node object               traverse through data contained in file             forvar i  0 i lt fileData.nodes.length i                 node  fileData.nodes[i]  assign current node to node object                 node.date  new Datenode.date                 rtm[node.id]  node  add node object to dictionary object                  check if date exists in dateArray                iffindDatenode.date, dates                    dates.pushnode.date  add dates that dont exist                                          getNodesfileData.nodes[0].date  finds the nodes to be visualized and updates the array passed to force.nodes             getLinksfileData.nodes[0].date  finds the nodes to be visualized and updates the array passed to force.links             start  initiates visualization after d3.json finishes                      function controls visualization.

Negative 2816 pIm currently building a monitoring facility based on JMX. The system to be monitored already exposes some KPIs in a publishsubscribe manner, i.e. a custom coded monitoring client can connect to the system, activate and subscribe to such KPIs and the system then notifies the client as soon as a new KPI value is available. As evaluation of those KPIs may be computationally expensive, only those KPIs having at least on subscribed client are evaluated. p  pMy task now is to extend the system providing a monitoring server based on JMX and JMX Notifications so that any JMX client can activate, subscribe and receive those KPIs. p  pThe problem I face is Each connected client changes some state on the server i.e. activates KPIs and registers some Listeners which I need to clean up as soon as the clients session is done or failed due to a connection loss. p  pConcerning sessions the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comotndocsjcpjmx1.4mrel3jsr160evalothJSpec relnofollowJMX specificationa states in chapter 13.1p  blockquote   pA session has state on the client, notably its listeners see Section 13.4 Adding   Remote Listeners on page 208. A session does not necessarily have state on the   server, and for the two connectors defined by this specification, it does not.p blockquote  pDoes anyone know of a JMXConnectorServer implementation allowing to maintain some session state Any code sample, tutorial or guidance in implementing such a server would also be highly appreciated. p
Negative 2816 pI have a fairly general question. I have written a fairly large rake task that goes through several API calls. On each API call I have written a fail safe likep  precodeif response.code  200     Email.delete codepre  pSo that works without any issue  If any API call throughout the entire script gives a response code of anything other than 200 it will abort. However, out of 100 times it seems like at least 12 times I get a timeout error. The script will freeze up for some time and then throw a timeout error.p  pHow can I escape that timeout error and make sure my script is running Email.delete if the script times out at any pointp  pThe big picture is my script is creating 10,000 emails. If it times out halfway, I dont want to have to resend all 10,000 emails. I would rather delete all of the emails and start over.p

Negative 2816 pShort background I am creating an app in which the user can see the menus for each restaurant. I have created a class called Dish in which the name, ingredients and price of a menu item is set.

Negative 2816 pIm coding iOS 6.1 and learning how to use Core Data.p  pThe documentation for fetchedObjects saysp  pThe results array reflects the inmemory state of managed objects in the controllers    managed object context, not their state in the persistent store. The returned array does not, however, update as managed objects are inserted, modified, or deleted.p  pThat last sentence bears on what Im seeing. p  pI.e., I fetch the data from an entity, I do a count of the fetched objects fetchedObjects.count and I get what I expect.  p  pThen I create a new object and I save it and then I do the fetchedObjects.count again and get the same result as last time  not bumped up by one as Id expected.p  pSo, my problem was how to get the fetchedObjects to update after Id saved my context.p  pI read about using the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13391934coredatansfetchedresultscontrollerfetchedobjectswillthismethodreflecrq1herea and tried out some of what was suggested which was that I use a delegate.p  pI assigned myself as the delegate.p  precode frc.delegate  self codepre  pI added the delegate like sop  precodeinterface DB  NSObject ltNSFetchedResultsControllerDelegategt codepre  pAnd I implemented the delegate call back like sop  precode void controllerDidChangeContent NSFetchedResultsController  controller                codepre  pAnd it all worked.   But I dont understand why.p  pIf I remove the three bits of delegate code, above, my code fails when I create a new object, save my context and then do the fetchedObjects.count.  It fails by the count coming up one short.p  pIf I add back the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate and the frc.delegate  self bits and leave out the call back routine, it still fails.p  pOnly if I also add the callback routine back in which does nothing functional, by the way, does my code succeed.p  pThis makes me a bit paranoid  as in wondering why it works if the callback does nothing and if this will work 99 of the time and then fail once in a blue moonp  pSo, I created a boolean and I set it in the callback routine so my code will not perform the  postsave count until its seen the boolean flip.  But, Im thinking this might be redundant  and maybe even silly.p  precodeoldCount  frc.fetchedObjects.count ltcreate a new object heregt frcDelegateCalled  FALSE    [self saveDB]    [frc.managedObjectContext processPendingChanges]    while  frcDelegateCalled  FALSE     newCount  frc.fetchedObjects.count codepre  pandp  precode void controllerDidChangeContent NSFetchedResultsController  controller        frcDelegateCalled  TRUE     codepre  pSo, the processPendingChanges call apparently hurries the update along and my boolean makes sure that the callback has been called indicating that the fetchedObjects has been updated before I recount.p  pIm a bit confused as to why the code works simply because a callback is present.   Can anyone shed some light herep

Negative 2816 pI have built an offline app in Phonegap, the JSON data gets pushed and gets to where it needs to go. But there are always a bunch of images that need to follow, and html5 cache will just not do it seeing it clears when an app is closed. I have been breaking my nugget on this for quite a while now.p  pThe issue is that you want to check if the image exists on the file system. Ive chosen to do so with a asyncfalse AJAX call, and therefore have the code running up to a point. I havent used the phonegap almost hack way by writing and setting overwrite to false which produces an error seeing that was another async function I didnt want to deal with wherein lies the problem async.p  pAnother problem is that the Phonegap browser allows best for 3 downloads at the time looked it up. My previous function was suffering from this debacle as it would just cut off downloading images if the amount simultaneous downloads was to high, which was around 20 to 40 depending on size images at the time which of course is not strange seeing download speed plummets when you divide it over multiple downloads at the time.p  pSo the question is, how to buildp  ol liA function that loops through JSON data image variables.li liDownloads them three at the time and set the meta data because Apple told it had toli liDeletes from disk those who are not needed anymore this last one is problem all over the inet as far as Ive read, so well keep this optional and because by now I really dont actually care about space anymore.li liShould run a function when all images are downloaded.li ol  pMy code as farp  precodevar datadir   var picsatthetime  0 var externalurlpics  httpFolder on server where images are   newconfig.pics holds the JSON data.

This complicates matters further.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pIn the above scenario, for the sake of simplicity, I have shown the standalone application and the thick client as separate but essentially they can be one application.p  pThe thick client that reads the XML data to display is coded in javafx.p

Negative 2816 ptook me a while, but I was able to successfully implement a diamondsquare algorithm to draw a plasma fractal using OpenGL. It is doing it by using a recursive function which is used each time a scene is generated I guess. What I wanted to do next is to add some extra function, to let the viewer move around the generated fractal. However, the problem is I cant make it work...so here are my questionsp  pIs it able to let the algorithm be rendered once Im not using any arrays to keep the record of generated points nor colours Is it just a matter of modifying the renderscene to do itp  pHow can I get rid of the grey spaces between squaresp  pIf there is no other way to do this except keeping the record of the values i.e. in an array could you give me an advice to do so, because Im getting lost in setting the indexes of an array...p  pHeres the code the comments are in polish though, as well as some of the variablesp

Negative 2816 pCurrently Im reading codeThink in Ccode.p  pIm confused about the strongconditional storage allocation for an objectstrong. p  pAs the code below, the codegotocode and codeswitchcode generate emwarning or an errorem. p  pBut codeifelsecode works fine, which is conditionally passed through during execution.p  pSo why there is no warning or error for codeifelsecode p  precode crosses initializaion error    include ltiostreamgt using namespace std class X  public     X  XX   void fint i      if i gt 2         X x1      else         X x2  why conditionally executed works fine          if i gt 2          goto jjump1          X x3   error coused by goto     X x3 works fine jjump1     X x4     switchi         case 1    X x5 break      case 2  X x6 break  error coused by switch        case 1 X x5 break        case 2 X x6 break  solved         int main      f1     return 0  codepre  pUPDATEp  pcodeC doing so is to guarantee that an object cannot be created unless it is also initialized.code But in the case of codeifelsecode how can both part of it be initialized as only one part of it will be go through p  pAs the C is following the practice in C of strongallocating the storage for a scope at the opening brace of that scope.strong  p  pHere is my thoughtI dont know whats wrong..p  pBut its the same for codeswitchcode and codegotocode, only the token case need to be initialized but there is crosses initialization error.

Negative 2816 pI have an Android Eclipse library project Lib that contains both Java and C code built with the NDK.  I have another project App, which is dependant on Lib.  App also contains both Java and C. My goal is to have multiple Eclipse Applike projects which each use the Lib project.p  pA Java routine in App calls a Java routine in Lib which calls C code in Lib.  This compiles, links, and runs perfectly on the device.p  pNow I want to add a call from the C code in App to the C code in Lib.  My First problem is header files.  I need to include a header file, jnilibjni,h, from the Lib projectp  precodeinclude libjni.h codepre  pin a .c file in App.  For this include to work I believe I need to add Libs jni directory to codeLOCALCINCLUDEScode in Apps jniAndroid.mk.  I do not want to hardcode this path, I would like to get it from Eclipse if possible.  After all, Ive told Eclipse that the App project depends on the Lib project and Eclipse knows how to connect Java calls between the two.p  pI temporarily kludged around the first problem by copying libjni.h from Libs jni directory to Apps jni directory.  Now Apps C code compiles, but it wont link it gets an undefined.  In Apps Android.mk I need to tell the C linker to link against libLib.so.  I tried putting lLib on codeLOCALLDLIBScode, but that didnt work.  libLib.so is in the Lib project in codeLiblibsarmeabilibLib.socode.  Eclipse knows to incorporate this .so into the .apk file it builds for App.p  pstrongIs there a way to emcleanlyem solve these two problemsstrongp  ol liAdd Libs jni directory to Apps codeLOCALCINCLUDEScodeli liAdd a reference to libLIb.so to Apps codeLOCALLDLIBScodeli ol  pI phrased these problems in terms of possible solutions.  Im open to any solution.  For example, if using codeLOCALLDLIBScode the wrong way to go, what is the right wayp  pstrongNotestrong Because App and Lib are two separate Eclipse projects built at separate times I am pretty sure I can not use codeLOCALEXPORTCINCLUDEScode in Libs Android.mk to make Libs jni directory available to Apps Anroid.mk  I tried it didnt work.  But Im prepared to be educated.p

Negative 2816 pWe are making an application which supports both tablet devices and mobile devices. We have provided different layouts for both the mobiles and tablets. We support landscape orientation for tablets and portrait for mobile. p  pNow we have one screen in app which allows user to open camera and take picture which then will be saved and shown to the user once the user will close camera. p  pApp works fine for tablet devices. But for mobile devices, it crashes once the camera app is closed after taking the picture. I then found out that Camera app for devices other than NexusVanilla Android in general have landscape orientation by default App works fine for nexus devices and so it recreatesreinitializes my main activity from which I have loaded my fragment after closing that camera app. p  pAfter trying to dig out some more, I found that camera app has orientation landscape in its source code file so I cant change that. That leaves me with 2 options p  p1 I need to integrate camera in my app only  it can be done but I dont want to do this option as it doesnt seem appropriate.p  p2 I need to implement some way to save instance of activity  I have only one activity to support tablet layout which loads all different fragments around 3035 fragments I guess  may be more than that and all this fragments have its own callbacks to activity. The fragment which opens the camera app is also opened by some callback method in activity so it seems very complex to implement this also. There will a huge number of variables to be retained which is not good. p  pPlease give me some other suggestion as to what other things can be done  Otherwise I will have to integrate camera in my app itself. p  pThanks in advance for your help. p

Negative 2816 pI am developing an application and currently I am trying to figure out how I should set up my database tables and relationships and what exact data needs to go into which table.  I need to be able to create and manage the following entitiesp  ul lipUsers managers They will be assigned to one strongparticular areastrong to manage e.g. a town or a town subdivision. They will be able to enter in the name of the area they will manage and will have to select one of the suggestions that will be pulled from a google maps search.pli lipBusinesses These are individual businesses with one address. However, a business can be created with any address in the UK, strongeven if no manager has been assigned to manage the area where that business is locatedstrong.pli ul  pNote that even if some businesses are created in an unmanaged area, once a manager is created for that area, he will automatically see all those businesses as his. This means that we cant assign a manager to each business individually as sometimes a manager might not exist for that area at the time of creation, but might be added in later on.p  pI have considered the following possible solutionp  ul lipHaving 3 tables Users, Areas and Businesses. Users would have a onetomany relationship with Areas table, which would actually allow one user to manage several areas. Areas would have a onetomany relationship with Businesses so that one Area could have multiple businesses. Each Business would have to be assigned to an area when created.pli lipThis would work, but there is one problem with this I would somehow have to create an Areas table with all possible areas in UK which would be a hard task. Not only would I have to add all areas, but I would also have to find and assign geo codes for each to do business  search within a certain radius around a post code later on. I do have a full UK postcode database file with over 2 million postcodes each having town, council, parish, ward, geo codes and some other info, however, each town subdivision usually an electoral ward has hundreds of postcodes and geo locations, which would make it very hard to try to generate an areas table with only one central geo code or post code for each area or town subdivision or whatever it is called.pli ul  pSo having explained my problem, I am asking you if my considered solution of having three tables, Users, Areas and Businesses, is actually a good solution, or if I have other better ways to solve this problem Is there a better way in which I could approach this problemp  pAny tips, info or answers would help a lot. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 2816 pIve left out coloring and such, but the idea that Im after is a 1000px wide 980 with padding header block no taller than 125px, with a 15 wide logo block on the left containing a clickable image that resizes to fit, a title block and nav block in the second, 85 wide column. The logo block extends six pixels beyond the bottom of the nav block due to the nav blocks 6px bottom margin.

Negative 2816 pIm a little confused about hashmapshashtables, because everywhere I look, I dont really get the answer im looking for. I still dont know if hashmaps use a static array or if they use dynamic lookup. This is how I thought hashmaps were stored at firstp  precode[Bucket 0] Object 1 [Bucket 4] Object 2 [Bucket 8000] Object 3 codepre  pI thought that if you wanted to get the value from bucket 8000 you would have to search through every bucket key before it until you reached 8000. Now after reading and watching some videos Im thinking its stored as a basic array likep  precode[Bucket 0] Object 1 [...3 buckets in between] [Bucket 4] Object 2 [...7795 buckets in between] [Bucket 8000] Object 2 codepre  pBut then when something generated huge hash codes it would waste tons of memory. Then somewhere learned that maybe it uses the codecode operator to keep them from using indexes too big, but then each bucket would be more likely to have a collision. So which is it I would think the most sensible one would be idea number one but Im not sure. Thanks.p

Negative 2816 pThe client wrote a REST API for their website before ever starting on an app. its a nice API, but it was designed to interact with a service thats running on the same network. The client didnt account for the fact that interaction over cellular data would take an exponentially longer amount of time than interaction on the same network, or even the same physical computer. Due to the fact that the client didnt account for this during server design, I am now left with an API that requires I transfer an entire object back and forth every single time the user changes 1 option. At first, it was slowing my main thread down by a ridiculous amount. So, I attempted to fix the problem by putting the API interaction on a background thread with a call to p  precode[self performSelectorInBackground] codepre  pThis helped a great deal. However, the graphics are still a little bit choppy. The speed at which the data is transferred and returned isnt overly important, as long as it happens. I was wondering if theres a method of lowering the background threads priority so that the graphics on the main thread arent affected at all, or at least, very little. Is that possiblep

I was told to ignore this one and just change the state back to GLNOERROR by using glGetError after initializing GLEW. The other error code appeared after using glUseProgram in the renderfunction. I wanted to get some information out of this, but the gluErrorString function is deprecated in OpenGL 3.3 and I couldnt find an alternative provided by any of my libraries.pli lipI tried validating my program via glValidateProgram after linking it. When I did this, the glPosition error message didnt show up anymore, but the triangle didnt either, so I assumed that this function just clears the infolog to put in some new information about the validation processpli ul  pSo right now, I have no idea what causes this error.p

That is, the algorithm can take advantage of concurrencymultithreading. p  pIt isnt doing any concurrent processing at the moment.  However, for the latter enhancements, im trying to make the class structured for this. p  pOne thing im doing is p  pkeeping the field members amp methods that read the problem, and have no affect or are affected by the solution instances as codestaticcodep  pamp p  pthe rest of the members the field variables specific to each solution space amp methods that run on solution spaces as codenonstaticcode. p  pIs the anything more I should do for future concurrency at this pointp  pTIA. p
Negative 2816 pIm using excel macros for the first time VBA too. I have data yffrequency lets say 10 curves data all in the same sheet each one in a column which is not the case, I have much more.

Negative 2816 pHey guys Im trying to make a program that helps people encrypt messages and decrypt messages using the Caesar shift cipher, I know its probably already been done, I want to have a go myself though.p  pThe problem Ive been having is when it comes to encrypting the text. The user selects a number between 125 and then the application will change the letters corresponding to the number chosen, e.g. if the user inputs HI and selects 2, both characters are moved two places down the alphabet outputting JK. My main problem is the replacing characters though, mostly because Ive set up the program to be able to encrypt large blocks of text, because my code isp  precode    If cmbxKey.Text  1 Then         If txtOutput.Text.Containsa Then             sOutput  txtOutput.Text.Replacea, b             txtOutput.Text  sOutput         End If          If txtOutput.Text.Containsb Then             sOutput  txtOutput.Text.Replaceb, c             txtOutput.Text  sOutput         End If     End If codepre  pThis means if the user inputs HAY it will change it to HBY and then because of the second if statement it will change it to HCY but I only want it to be changed once.

Its odd it isnt reported as missing though until it runs through Ghostscript.p  pThe PDF is created by Adobe InDesign and the font is copyrighted like most so I cant share it.p  pstrongEdit  Ive accepted Kens answer as he helped me on the Ghostscript bug tracker. In summary, it seems the font is broken as suspected due to the missing glyf table. Until I hear otherwise Ill have to suppose this is a bug in InDesign, and will continue investigating.strongp

Negative 2816 pI have my signalr hub running in IIS server and .net signalr client as windows service running on 2008 R2 server. The Server url is https ssl and client side .net code checks for ServerCertificateValidationCallback , and that callback takes 1020secs to validate the CRL. The issue I see here is CRL check while connecting to connection.Start.Wait, happening three times. And timingout. Please let me know why onconnect it does call three times the crl callback. But on reconnect it does call CRL callback one time. p  pAlso because our CRL callback takes more time 1020 secs, i had to keep transportconnectiontimeout to 1 mins in Server hub. p  pPlease need help. p

Therefore if I change properties of this entity, it shouldnt affect the data stored in second level cache. That meaning when I retrieve the entity again in another session, its properties should not be affected by the described change. p  pFor examlep  precodeuser  userDao.find1              get user stored in second level cache  System.out.printlnuser.getName  returns originalName  user.setNamemodifiedName    this is done in a different session   user  userDao.find1  System.out.printlnuser.getName  should return originalName codepre  pI tried the above example with ehcahce and it really works but my question isp  pstrongIs this behavior guaranteedstrong I mean if I can depend on it even when I change the cache provider, or when the implementation of my used cache provider changes I looked in the JPA specification and didnt find information on this.p

Negative 2816 pI have Gemalto BGS5T java module and 1wire temperature sensor. I have java midlet which uses RSR232 port to communicate with temperature sensor. But the problem is that, I get no response from the sensor no matter what I send. Sensor has the right voltage on it, so the connection should be fine. I tried testing my program so that I connected rsr232 port to computer and watched with terminalTermite if the sent data was correct and everything looks like it should.  Another test was that I connected temperature sensor directly to computer and sent data with terminal and it worked like it should. I even got responses on some random inputs like 9999. I checked the parameters for connection inside the terminal and copied them to java midlet, but with no success.

Negative 2816 pIn my rails 3.2 app, I have a few dynamically built tables that timeout on Heroku when the columns X times the rows gets too large because of the iteration load for each table cell.  A table with 6 columns and 30 rows does 180 calls to load DB records. To understand what I mean by a dynamically built table, the table is a Parent Class. The columns and rows each represent classes that belong to Parent AND the cells are represented by a manytomany join table for the columns and rows, with attributes of its own.  Any Parent can have custom number of columns and rows with attributes of their own.p  precode  parenttable   hasmany        columns, dependent  gt destroy   hasmany        rows,    dependent  gt destroy    column   hasmany        columnrows,       dependent  gt destroy   hasmany        rows,  through    gt columnrows    row   hasmany        columnrows,       dependent  gt destroy   hasmany        columns,  through    gt columnrows codepre  pThe schema is working great in the testing.

Negative 2816 pI have some hosting set up with WHM  cPanel I have root access and a bit of an odd requirement in that I need a single accounts main domain to point through to a specific directory in publichtml but the URL must not have any subdirectories on it.p  pe.g. abc.co.uk needs to load files that are in publichtml123, I was able to get it to work through redirects but I had abc.co.uk123 which caused problems with paths and all sorts.p  pI have discovered I can do this with addon domains as you can specify the document root but you cant do this for the main domain. I did consider changing the main account domain to something different and then setting the main domain as an addon domain. There are email accounts setup at the moment and I am not sure if they will be affected by this, I have done something like this before but it was many years ago and I cant remember what I did now.p  pI also believe I can change some config files somewhere to achieve this but I was not sure which I would need to change to and I have read that cPanel will overwrite any custom changes when I update and I only want this to affect a single account.p  pIs there a simple way of achieving this I dont have control over the website being developed and have just been told it needs to be done this way.p  pThanksp

Negative 2816 pIm developing an MMORPG and just want to hear the two different arguments between storing information in this case game logs to a file.p  pWould it be better to output the information as it gets created into a file were talking possibly 1030 entries every couple seconds, or store it in memory until the program is shutting down, and then dump all the information into a file before it terminates.p  pI can see arguments for both ends mainly being if we keep it in memory, it will begin to take up a lot of resources on the computers end, and if we wait until the program shuts down and for whatever reason the program shuts down via a crash and the information isnt saved this would be quite bad in an MMORPG stand point...

Negative 2816 pstrongTLDRstrong  Storing users login password for web app in memory in JS for use in clientside encryption of users data yea or nayp  hr  pIm working on a web application where users can store notes in the cloud. Users have a password to login. emIn additionem, users can elect to encrypt notes using a password. The notes are stored encrypted in the cloud, meaning only the user can decrypt them and notes are lost if their password is lost.p  pFor user convenience it would be better to use the same password for account login and for note encryption, and, upon login, to store that password in memory in a JS variable so they dont have to reenter their password every time the application needs to encrypt or decrypt anything for instance if they update a note.p  pIs this insecure Yes, an attacker with access to the users machine could do a memory dump, or insert breakpoints into uglified JS, etc., and obtain the password. But an attacker with access to the users machine could do this anyway in order to log in at all there is necessarily a point where the users password is accessible in plain text in my applications JS.p  pSo it seems okay to me  no more insecure than emnotem storing it.

This question is relative to the previous onep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28369024gstreamerneitherkeeprtspalivenorreconnecttoanipcameraGStreamer neither keep rtsp alive nor reconnect to an ip cameraap  pI used wireshark to grab packages between IP camera and my pc and it showsp  precodetimes    pc             ipcamera 5.72       DESCRIBE 5.836      SETUP          return timeout80 5.755      SETUP 5.763      PLAY 80.775     GETPARAMETER 155                       TCPFIN,ACK codepre  pso it might be the case that the clock of the camera is faster therefore the real timeout clock is shorter than 80s, while gstreamer is sending out keepalive message every 80s according to server returns. Therefore I wonder how one can change the time interval between two keepalive messages of rtspsrc. Rtspsrcs pages only mentioned on the time interval used by gstreamer to decide whether a link is down. p  pThank you.p
Negative 2816 pI am in this situation Please note that I am still new to the idea of this ssh thingp  pBasically, I have already set up SSH for my Github, so every time I do codegit push origin mastercode, it will not prompt me to enter username and password, which is good. Now I want to set up another SSH for logging onto my school server. I wanted to follow the same instruction which I did for Github in this a hrefhttpshelp.github.comarticlesgeneratingsshkeys relnofollowlinka. But after I typed in sshkeygen t rsa C meschool.com . It says that code.sshidrsa already exists. Overwrite yncode . p  pObviously, I do not want to overwrite it, since I still want instant access to my Github account. I know that I can create another codeidrsacode under a different name, but strongis this a good approach  Does it have any sideeffects strong It seems to look nicer if I can just  append the new RSA key to the existing codeidrsacode strongbut I have no idea how to do so.strong Need to know the right command to do this I guessp

Negative 2816 pI have created a number of standalone automated testcases captured using CodedUITest in Visual Studio 2013, to test webpages.p  pThey work fine within Visual Studio, individually and when several of them are put into a single project as a solution, to create a kind of playlist.p  pHowever, Im trying to use Microsoft Test Manager as a frontend  in order to be able to select which tests, create playlists, decide how many times a specific testcase should be run etc, with the results stored.p  pTFS is being used to both store my individual testcases, and, where Id like to deposit the resultant output of passfail etc.p  pTrouble is, even though the testautomation part functions very well within Visual Studio, getting Microsoft Test Manager to function with what I have, and its associated environment is proving a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.p  pMy system is simple I have a virtual machine setup with the testing environment which allows within VS for me to run these automated tests.p  pWhy is this proving so difficult to work with MTM It should be easy  I should simply be having to point MTM at the folder my testcases are stored, and use its GUI to tell it what and how many tests I want to run.p  pAnyone else have a similar problem, or a similar setupp  pAll MS do is point me to countless pages which Ive already read  for which the whole lot seems to be much deeper than it needs to be.p

Negative 2816 pI am preparing for the OCA SE 7 exam, and some of these questions are really  tricky.p  pIn one of the books Im using I found an error I think, so I would like to confirm the following please... p  precodepublic static void mainString... args      String autumn  new Stringautumn       line one     System.out.printlnautumn  summer   line two  codepre  pAfter the codeprintlncode method executes, how many codeStringcode objects are there in the poolp  pIt is my understanding that  line one does not add the string to the pool  line two creates autumn and summer and adds them to the pool So the correct answer in the book is 2. p  pHowever, I also think... since Im supposed to be paranoid with the exam questions... that also the string false is created and added to the pool... So I think 3 should be the correct answer... or does some other black magic happen like... true and false are already put into the pool by the JVM by default or something...p  pCan someone please confirmp  hr  pEdit after some research I find that it was not fair of me to speak of an error in the book as a general tip exam questions are usually formulated in terms of the following code so they are clearly interested in plain old simple calculation of what the code itself is locally doing. So the scope therefore does not allow inspection of the codeprintlnboolean bcode implementation or compiler optimizations. Fair enough p

Negative 2816 pI am given 3 DLLs API to external system and I can use those with my executable on Windows 7 32bit .net 4.p  pThen I need to sign my executable with a strong name.p  pIt mandates that the API DLLs will also be signed with the same strong name, if I understand correct.p  pAnd Ive seen posts how to do that ildasmilasm, or Brutal Developer, or Crypto Obfuscator and tried everything I put my hands on. Yet still getting strong name signed assemblies must specify a public key in their InternalsVisibleTo declaration.p  pAnyone been there also and managed to get out safelyp  pRegards, Orenp  pPS 1, I did manage to make it work on Windows 7 64bit there the 3 APIs DLLs were signed with Crypto Obfuscator done by previous developer. I started to investigate when it did not work in 32bit and I have realized I am using the signed DLLs. Then Ive located the original DLLs, but was only able to run without strong name in neither my assemblies nor the API. Any other combination, even when my assemblies were not signed or everything was signed to the best of my knowledge, did not work.p  pPS 2, I have also another DLL of mine, which works nicely with the executable I sign both, so I have a total of 5 assemblies, 2 mine and 3 given, Im not sure it is related, but brought it here anyhow.p

Negative 2816 pIm working on a rough TCP ServerClient. It works like this Client sends message to server  Server sends all user data to each client. I have this in a loop as Im going to use this transfer of data for multiplayer in a game.  However, for some reason my server will combine incoming data into one string instead of reading it line by line.  For example, it should read something like john00 for user data, but instead it reads like john00john00john00john00 Ive tried setting a delay on sending and receiving, but it only seems to work if I delay more than 100ms.  p  pServerp  precodeclass Program       private static Socket serverSocket     private static readonly ListltSocketgt clientSockets  new ListltSocketgt     private const int

Negative 2816 pSo Im having a little trouble understanding how multiple segue between multiple view controllers specifically multiple table views on a general level. Even after looking at responses and trying to search for examples of table views connecting to different table views, I still couldnt find a solid explanation and was wondering if someone could clarify for me.

Im little hesistant about this approach considering that the cells in Main View Controller is all the same and it seems a bit redundant to create seperate view controllers. This way, I could tell what each List of Subs View Controller cells type would be simply by the segue identifier.p  pIf Scenario 1 is correct, how would I get the cell identifier from the Table View Controller when Im currently viewing List of Subs View Controller in Swiftp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 2816 pIm writing an import script in PHP to bring tables from SQL Server into MySQL, and Im wrapping all charvarchar values in singlequotes for insertion. This works fine until the script encounters a value that has a singlequote in it. The obvious solution is to use codeaddslashescode, but that isnt working for me. I also tried codehtmlspecialcharscode as well as codemysqlirealescapestringcode, but neither worked.

Finally, I tried wrapping the values in double instead of singlequotes, but that gave me the same error upon encountering a row where the values doublequotes could not be escaped.p  pUntil the point of error, the script successfully inserts multiple chunks of 1,000 rows each, so I know the INSERT statement isnt formatted incorrectly.

Negative 2816 pI have set up an application level event class to monitor when new workbooks are created opened by following a hrefhttpwww.cpearson.comexcelappevent.aspx relnofollowCPearsons guidea. This works fine in isolation. However, it is intended as part of addin Im writing where several other subs are also called in the WorkbookOpen sub, see below codep  precodePrivate XLApp As baseCXlEvents  Private Sub WorkbookOpen     Set XLApp  New baseCXlEvents     test     AddLocalReferences     AddModules     AddClassModules     Debug.Print testing End Sub codepre  pSo the codeXLAppcode variable is called in the module scope as a codebaseCXlEventscode class. I have added a codeClassTerminatecode event to this class and this is triggered after the codeDebug.print testingcode is run, i.e. codeXLAppcode is terminated after the codeWorkbookOpencode sub has run. This does not happen when I quote out the subs codeAddLocalReferencescode, codeAddModulescode, and codeAddClassModulescode, which do exactly as their names would imply. The sub codetestcode only prints a messages in debug to test whether calling additional subs caused codeXLAppcode to be terminated.p  pMy current hunch is that adding references, modules, or class modules counts as editing, causing it to be terminated, as explained in a hrefhttpssupport.microsoft.comengbkb141693 relnofollowthis MS Support documenta. But, if so, why doesnt codeXLAppcode get terminated until the end of the sub As opposed to as soon as codeAddLocalReferencescode is run.p  pAny suggestions why the class is terminated I need it to stay alive and also need to load additional modules and references for the addin upon workbookopen.

I feel like i should be able to bind the multiselects text value or something and use that in the function,pli lipthe filter stops processing if i keep typing characters beyond the minLength setting. If i type cha the ds fetches Charles and Chad.
