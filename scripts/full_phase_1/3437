Positive 3437 pI can do the codeadmineditcode, codeadmindeletecode, codeadminprintcode and codeadminmanagetagscode actions on an codeArticlesControllercode, those actions will require an codeidcode passed.

So Id like to have something like thisp  precodedefnplus f [x] inc x codepre  p...expand out to something like thisp  precodedefn specialmetadata fixedvalue f [x] inc x codepre  pIn principle this doesnt seem that hard to me, but Im having trouble nailing down the specifics of getting the code[args]code and other forms in the defined function to be parsed out correctly.p  pAs a bonus, if possible Id like the macro to be able to handle all of the disparate forms of defn ie, with or without docstrings, multiple arity definitions, etc.  I saw some things in the a hrefhttpcode.google.compclojurecontribwikiDefApiDoccodeclojurecontribdefcodea package that looked possibly helpful, but it was difficult to find sample code which used them.p
Negative 3437 pIve built a screensaver for Leopard which utilises coreanimation. It doesnt do anything overly complicated uses a tree of CALayers and CATextLayers to produce a table of data in the following structurep  precode root    maincontainer      subcontainer        row [multiple]          cell [multiple]            text layer codepre  pAt most there are 50 CALayers rendered on the screen at any one time.p  pOnce Ive built the table, Im adding animating the subcontainer into view using CABasicAnimation. Again, Im not doing anything fancy  just a simple fadein.p  pThe problem is that while the animation does happen its empainfulem to watch. Its jerky on my development machine which is a 3.06Ghz iMac with 4GB of RAM, and seems to chop the animation into 10 steps rather than showing a gradual change.p  pIt gets worse on the ppc macmini the screensaver is targeted for it refuses to even play the animation, generally tweening from the beginning of the animation 0 opacity to halfway 50 then completing.p  pIm relatively new to ObjectiveC and my experience is based on using garbagecollected environments, but I cant believe Im leaking enough memory at the point the screensaver starts to cause such problems.p  pAlso, Im quite sure its not a problem with the hardware. Ive tested the builtin screensavers which use coreanimation, and downloaded a few free CAbased for comparison, and they run without issue on both machines.p  pInformation is pretty thin on Google with regards to using CA in screensavers, or using CA in general for that matter, and advicetutorials on profilingtroubling screensavers seems to be nonexistant. So any help the community can provide would be well welcomedp  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pSeems as though implicit animations help smooth things out a little. Still kinda jerky, but not as bad as trying to animate everything with explicit animations as in my solution.p
Negative 3437 pIm currently on a coop term working on a project nearing completion with one other coop student.  Since this project has been passed down from coop to coop, poor practices have been taken along the way and testing has been left until the end.

Negative 3437 pA common pattern in the .NET Framework is the TryXXX pattern I dont know if thats what they really call it, in which the called method attempts to do something, returning codeTruecode if it was successful, or codeFalsecode if the operation failed.  A good example is the generic codeDictionary.TryGetValuecode method.p  pDocumentation for these methods say that they will not throw exceptions  that failure will be reported in the method return value.  All good so far.p  pI recently encountered two different circumstances in which .NET Framework methods that implement the TryXXX pattern threw exceptions.  See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1148278buginsystemrandomconstructorhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1148278buginsystemrandomconstructora and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1120283uritrycreatethrowsuriformatexceptionhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1120283uritrycreatethrowsuriformatexceptiona for details.p  pIn both cases, the codeTryXXXcode method called other methods that threw unexpected exceptions, and those exceptions escaped.  My question  does this break the implied contract of not throwing exceptionsp  pPut another way, if you were writing codeTryFoocode, would you guarantee that exceptions cannot escape, by writing it like thisp  precodepublic bool TryFoostring param, out FooThing foo      try               do whatever         return true          catch              foo  null         return false       codepre  pIts tempting, because that guarantees no exceptions will escape, thereby honoring the implied contract.  But its a bug hider.p  pMy gut feeling, based on my experience, says that this is a really bad idea.  But if codeTryFoocode lets some exceptions escape, then what its really saying is, I wont throw any exceptions that I know how to handle, and then the whole idea of the contract I wont throw exceptions is thrown out the window.p  pSo, whats your opinion Should codeTryFoocode handle all exceptions, or just those that its expecting to happen  Whats your reasoningp

Negative 3437 pI have 2 questions p  pQ1 Can i implement an asynchronous timer in a single threaded application i.e i want a functionality like this.p  precode.... Timer mytimer5,timeOutHandler   .... this thread is doing some other task   ... and after 5 seconds, the timeOutHandler function is invoked. codepre  pAs far as i can think this cannot be done for a single threaded applicationcorrect me if i am wrong. I dont know if it can be done using select as the demultiplexer, but even if select could be used, the event loop would require one thread  Isnt it p  pI also want to know whether i can implement a timernot timeout using select. Select only waits on set of file descriptors, but i want to have a list of timers in ascending order of their expiry timeouts and want select to tell me when the first timer expires and so on. So the question boils down to can a asynchronous timer be implemented using selectpoll or some other event demultiplexer p  pQ2 Now lets come to my second question. strongThis is my main question.strong Now i am using a dedicated thread for checking timeouts i.e i have a min heap of timersexpiry times and this thread sleeps till the first timer expires and then invokes the callback. i.e code looks something like thisp  ol lilock the mutexli licheck the time of the first timerli licondition timed wait for that timeand wake up if some other thread inserts a timer with expiry time less than the first timer Condition wait unlocks the lock.li liAfter the condition wait ends we have the lock. So unlock it, remove the timer from the heap and invoke the callback function.li ligo to 1li ol  pI want the time complexity of such asynchronous timer. From what i see p  ol liInsertion is lgnli liExpiry is lgnli liCancellation li ol  p this is what makes me dizzy  the problem is that i have a min heap of timers according to their times and when i insert a timer i get a unique id. So when i need to cancel the timer, i need to provide this timer id and searching for this timer id in the heap would take in the worst case Onp  pAm i wrong p  pCan cancellation be done in Olg np  pPlease do take care of some multithreading issues. I would elaborate on what i mean by my previous sentence once i get some responses.p

Negative 3437 pHow would you modularize a large application that has some incoming SOAP webservices, some outgoing webservices, transformations between them and internal formats, internal logging services, accesses external archiving webservices, delays stuff and works on this asynchronously and so forthp  pOne way is to split the functionality into a collection of WAR, deploy all of them on one application server and have them communicate with internal webservices. This has some overhead, especially if the messages are large, and you might run into performance problems due to thread count restrictions and so forth.p  pAnother way would be to put everything into a giant WAR, such that you can communicate directly. Not exactly modularization. What would you dop

Negative 3437 pASP.NET MVC has come a long way compared to webforms in becoming a unit testable framework. However, we are often faced with some remaining pigs like FormsAuthentication, which I usually wrap in some type of UserSession object to keep it clean and testable. The other day I realized I was using Server.MapPath in my controller action, and while things like MvcContrib make it easyish to mock the current request, I found myself going down the path of creating a FileSystemService class to wrap operations with the file system. The benefits are that you get a tight API exposing just the methods you need, and its easy to stubmock in tests. The downside is that it is yet another constructor dependency.p  pWhat does the SO community thing about this situation Where do you draw the line when trying to make your controllers as light and flexible as possible p

However, by their omission of any further info, and by their example below this ONLY applies to the immediate children, not the nodes beneath each child.  So its possible to have a value somewhere in the left subtree that is  the current nodes value.li ol  pThis is NOT a selfbalancing tree the existing tree structure will not be changed on an insert, aside from adding the new value in a new leaf node.  No switches or shifts of values or nodes allowed.p  pAlso given was an example of the tree structure after test values were insertedp  precodeIf we insert 8, 5, 9, 3, 3, 2, 12, 4, 10      8      8   5        8   5 9      8   5 9  3      8   5 9  3   3      8   5 9  3    2 3      8   5 9  3   12 2 3      8   5 9  3   12 2 3    4       8   5   9  3  10 12 2 3    4 codepre  pI assumed the 10 was the right child of 5, since the given constraint prevents it from being the left child of 9.p  pMy requirements, given the rule above for nodes and the example of expected tree structure and behavior for given input write a traversal and insertion algorithm for this tree.p  pSince this isnt a real BST and were not allowed to alter the tree, I couldnt think of any clever way to perform traversal, other than using another datastructure to get this in order.p  pIve got an insertion algorithm which might work, but since it would have to allow back ups to the parent node and exploration of the other path in both cases where it starts traveling down the left or the right, it would be a really funky looking algorithm.p  pThis question was placed alongside normal, basic programming questions, so it seemed a little out of place.  So...any insights here  Or am I overlooking something obvious  p  pstrongEDITstrong Problem solved.  It WAS a typo introduced by the testgiver.

Negative 3437 pWhen starting a certain activity of my app, the user is welcomed with a dialog that he must fill with some data in order to proceed. Then, in the activity per se, the user has 2 buttons that enable him to dynamically create and delete an infinite number of fields that are composed by several viewsp  pAs you know, when the screen orientation changes, the activity is restarted so every information is lost. Obviously, this can be problematic.p  pIn order to handle the screen orientation, android documentation advises developers to use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcesarticlesfasterscreenorientationchange.html relnofollowonRetainNonConfigurationInstancea. The only problem is that if you use it to save objects in a context all the views tied will leak. This is further problematic in my case, since the data in that activity is inherently tied to its view, which, in turn, is tied with its context.p  pAndroid Documentation does not recommend developers to handle configuration changes themselves. They state and I quote in general, a shortterm solution that will only complicate their lives laterp  pI can bypass the initial dialog easily, creating a hasBeenShown Boolean and set it to true, for instance. I can even bypass the dynamically created views problem by saving their metadata in this case the number of fields generated, their type, their relative position to each other, their text or selection, and so on... with some minor bugs, but nothing serious.p  pBut since fieldsviews are generated dynamically with layoutInflateand thus we can have an infinite number of views, when regenerating those same fields after screen orientation change, the application gets really really slow even on emulator. With 20 fields approximately 120 views on a real device Samsung Galaxy S it took almost 1 minute to complete.p  pStrangely, when I passed views directly and thus, leaking all that stuff, it took my Samsumg Galaxy S less than 10 seconds to complete.  p  pWith this information, what do you think its the best approachp  p1  Let the fields reset not really an option, I bet anyone would get pissed if they inadvertently tilt their screen Pp  p2  Add a loading screen while android takes care of changing screen orientationp  p3  Block screen orientation changep  p4  Handle screen orientation change myself, and hope the impeding Doom Android docs talk about never comes.p  pP.S A bit offtopic, but when my activity finishes, all memory is released rightp

Negative 3437 pI have a rather large application which, on the admin frontend, takes a few seconds to load a page because of all the pageviews that it has to load into objects before displaying anything. Its a bit complex to explain how the system works, but a few of my other questions explains the system in great detail. The main difference between what they say and the current system is that the customer frontend no longer loads all the pageviews into objects when a customer first views the page  it simply adds the pageview to the database and creates an object in an unsynchronised list... to put it simply, when a customer views a page it no longer loads all the pageviews into objects but the admin frontend still does.p  pI have been working on some admin tools on the customer frontend recently, so if an administrator clicks the description of an item in the catalogue then the right hand column will display statistics and available actions for the selected item. To do this the page which gets loaded through codeactioncontainer.loadbla bla blacode into the right hand column has to loop through ALL the pageviews  this ultimately means that ALL the pageviews are loaded into objects if they havent been already. For some reason this loads really REALLY fast. The difference in speed is only like a second on my dev site, but the live site has thousands of pageviews so the difference is quite big...p  pSo my question is why is it that the admin frontend loads so slowly while using codebla.loadblacode is so fast I mean whatever method jQuery uses, cant browsers use this method too and load pages superfast Obviously not as someone wouldve done that by now  but I am interested to know just why the difference is so big... is it just my system or is there a major difference in speed between the browser getting a page and jQuery getting a page Do other people experience the same kind of differencesp  pThanks in advance,p  pRegards,p  pRichardp

Negative 3437 pIve modified an existing strored procedure. It originally had one ouput parameter in the stored proc and it was set up as follows in the c code that called itp  precodecmd.Parameters.AddVar1Param, SqlDbType.BigInt if Var1  0                 cmd.Parameters[Var1].Value  DBNull.Value             else                 cmd.Parameters[Var].Value  Var1             cmd.Parameters[Var1].Direction  ParameterDirection.InputOutput cmd.ExecuteNonQuery               Get Var1 Var1 dataMorph.ToInt64cmd.Parameters[Var1].Value.ToString codepre  pJust to clarify, this parameter was declared as OUTPUT in the stored proc but as inputoutput in the C code. This worked fine.p  pI have added another parameter to the same stored procedure and I want to retrieve both from the C code. The C code now is as followsp  precode  SqlParameter Var1Param               if VAR1  0                  Var1Param  new SqlParameterVar1, DBNull.Value              else                  Var1Param  new SqlParameterVar1,Var1                Var1Param.Direction  ParameterDirection.InputOutput               cmd.Parameters.AddVar1Param codepre  pAgain this parameter is declared as output in the stored proc but inputoutput in the c code. Here is the new parameter. This is declared as output in the stored procedured. Here is the C code.p  precodeSqlParameter Var2Param  new SqlParameterVar2, 0             Var2Param.Direction  ParameterDirection.Output             cmd.Parameters.AddVar2Param codepre  pI only want to output the second parameter as you can see. The assignment of 0 to this parameter seems to be a standard practice despite the fact its an output variable only. Im not sure if need to give it a type.p  pNow the executionp  precode             Execute             cmd.ExecuteScalar             connection.Close               Get DonationID             Var1  dataMorph.ToInt64cmd.Parameters[Var1].Value.ToString              Get Supersession Daf ID return param to see if new DAF was created             Var2  dataMorph.ToInt64cmd.Parameters[Var2].Value.ToString codepre  pWhat happens is that both the var1 and vaf2 parameters contain the value that was assigned to Var2 parameter in the stored procedure. I have read that any number of  parameters and parameter types can be used but it seems like the value assigned to Var2 is overwriting the Value that had been passed in or assigned to Var1.p  pAny advice I know I can work around this by having multiple result sets and putting my output values in the second result set but Id rather not deal with Kludges unless I have to. Ive seen a lot of posts about the odd state of parameters after they return from stored procs and are accessed in c. Is this type of behavior a bugp  hr  pI  will point out that Im using executenonquery because the SP does an update. sarfeast is using execute scalar. Im assuming that this shouldnt make any difference but Ill ask if anyone has any ideas on why this is happening. I modified the code by specifying sizes for the sqlparameters and now the value for var2 is showing up in var1 and var2 is Nullp  pAny advice would be appreciated.p

The incFormFields.cfm file contains the following section that returns the select boxp  precodeltdiv idRepIDDivgt ltcfparam nameclientID defaultdefaultClientIDgt ltcfparam nameselectedList defaultdefaultRepIDgt   ltcfset clientReps  application.clientService.getRepsByClientIDclientIDgt ltlabel forrepIDgtClient Repsltlabelgt            ltcftrygt             ltselect namerepID idrepID multiplemultiple size5gt                 ltoption valuegt    ltoptiongt                 ltcfoutput queryclientRepsgt                     ltoption valuerepID ltcfif listfindselectedList,repIDgtselectedselectedltcfifgtltcfif repActive NEQ truegtstylecolorcececeltcfifgtgtrepFirstName repLastName repJobTitle ltoptiongt                 ltcfoutputgt             ltselectgt        ltdivgt codepre  pSo I KNOW the whole process works as coded  because the page loads correctly and away we go.p  pHowever I also have the following code to reload incFormFields.cfm pagep  precodeltcfoutputgt clientID.changefunction          var tmpID  this.val         alertthis.val         divrepDiv.loadincincFormFields.cfm RepIDDiv,clientIDthis.val,selectedListreplist       ltcfoutputgt codepre  pNow on the surface it looks like it should work.  The first thing it does is create an alert with the value of the selected form field  this alert show me the CORRECT select box selected value.  However that same value does NOT get passed to the incFormFields.cfm document appropriately not at all I thinkp  pIf I dump the value or clientID in the included file  it is always defaultClientID.p  pSo the question  why does this work on page load  but NOT onChangep  pI am stumped.

Negative 3437 pI want to find a solution to make webpage for closed group private in which is possible for accounts with writting ability to post twitter like messeges when new info needed to be posted and that it can have many teams like Project Team A amp B.p  pEach user could be in many teams. All team writings can be viewable in one page but on other page only those writings that comes from only each users teams which can be 2 or 3.p  pExample for twitter is the wordpress.com theme a hrefhttpen.blog.wordpress.com20090311p2thenewprologue relnofollowhttpen.blog.wordpress.com20090311p2thenewprologuea.p  pBut it lacks need of being able to make Teams. It has tags but every time tag needs to be written so if it would be possible to auto make if Im from Team A then tag all my team tags on each my post automatically.p  pEither existing service for that just register wordpress, identi.ca or service like kodingen.com where i can deploy Joomla or other CMS.p  pA CMS like joomla I hope some has some solution with plugins or wordpress cms that has that theme I mentioned. Diaspora, maybe but havent tried it. Buddypress.com just somehow came on google when randomly searched.p  pTwitter can be private but only for whole account so I need new account that is OK, but it doesnt have auto tags if Im from Team A.p  pFacebook cant have privacy. All users will be anonymous so new profile making in FB could be good and making groups and all users invite only each other, but they need to be anonymous, which is opposite of facebook. Maybe even workflow will be interupted if some user gets banned becuase its a Narwhal or Dragon.p  pOptionally, pages can also be made and even better if collaborative, like Google Wave or Docs can be made and added countdown timer added. Countdown is more needed comparing to page writing like Docs or Wave that can be just any small Wiki plugin.p

Negative 3437 pIve recently had a few issues when trying to run SQLLite powered inmemory repository mock Repository pattern with Fluent Nhibernate. When I ran the tests against a TeamCity build agent on Windows Server 2008 the tests were failing with unable to load System.Data.SQLite exceptions.p  pAfter some fiddling I remembered there was a x64 version of System.Data.SQLite in the downloaded SqlLite binaries. Dropping that next to unit tested assembly and running tests through NUnit UI worked and no longer threw any exceptions.p  pMy question is is it possible to tell the build something like when compiling on x64 system, reference the binary from folder B and when on x86 system, from folder A So a conditional reference includep  pThe only other option I can think of right now is to limit TeamCity build agents to be x64 and use a command line script build step to overwrite assembly in binRelease folder in between build finishing ant unit tests running. Development environments are all x86 so thats the root of the issue.p  pWriting this there is one other option  but a messy one  modify the project file after svn build source is downloaded and before the build runs using a script.p

The Magento Admin page is looking for adminhtmldefaultdefaultreset.css instead of picnprint.meskinadminhtmldefaultdefaultp  pIf I place the CSS and JS files in the locations that the admin pages are currently pathing to then the Magento Admin will load normally but wont allow me to login.p  pAlso, All the product pages on the front end are displaying blank, the site template loads but no product content loads. Does anyone know what the cause of these issues could be and how I remedy the problemp  pCheers,p  pAndyp

Negative 3437 pI have been debugging a Python program which segfaults after receiving a codeKeyboardInterruptcode exception. This is normally done by pressing kbdCtrlCkbd from the shell. To test if a particular code change fixed the bug, I had a small shellscript that sent codeSIGINTcode to the program at random time after startup. The problem I have is that sending kbdCtrlCkbd seems to have a different effect on the program than sending the signal codeSIGINTcode and is thus not causing the bug to appear, so I quite wonder what the difference is then between the two actions.p  pThe program does not catch any keyboard actions at all, and is just a python program with some threadsprocesses in them. It installs no signal handlers though Python does, and codestty acode gives codeintr  Ccode. I suspect it might be that kbdCtrlCkbd sends codeSIGINTcode to all the subprocessesthreads while codekill INTcode only sends to the primary process, but that is as far my suspicions go.p  pHere is the shell script which sends the codekill INTcode.p  pre classlangsh prettyprintoverridecodewait while  do     secondspython c import random print random.random4     .mandos debug configdirconfdir               statedirstatedir norestore nodbus amp     pid      sleep seconds kill INT pid  amp     fg .mandos     status     if [ status gt 1 ] then         echo Failed exit status after seconds seconds         break     fi     wait done codepre

Negative 3437 pI am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.p  pI have a windows service written in C that calls into a dll released by an major telecoms service provider here in South Africa TELKOM. The dll is called MPIEst.dll, and I believe it was written in C. The guy at the link httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSwindowscompatibilitythreada7e5aafcbb5242c3a3b719cb4cfbf6d5 sort of had the same problem I had.p  pAfter doing some research I found out that DEP Data Execution Prevention was to blame for the error Unable to load DLL MPIest.dll Invalid access to memory location. Exception from HRESULT 0x800703E6. So I thought ok thats easy...lets turn off DEP for the whole computer and see what happens. So I do this and the result becomes even weirder...The windows service runs successfully like nothing happens, but all calls into the DLL dont do anything at all.p  pI know this because when I wrote a normal C console app that uses the DLL, the DLL methods returned values and worked properly, but when run from within the windows service, the DLL methods return a nonzero result, which indicates that something went wrong. The thing is there is no documentation that says what the return codes mean.p  pAnyway the bottom line is that somehow turning off DEP for the whole system doesnt affect a windows service.

With appreciation to indirect for his original answer, I want to call attention to kelvins newer less upvoted answer, summarized above.p  pMy false assumption Only a single version of a gem could be installed at a time, hence the need for gemsets to isolate the namespace.  Not true.  Multiple versions of a gem may be installed concurrently.  The most recent one will be used when invoked from a command line, unless you have a Gemfile specifying the version constraints and invoke the command via codebundle execcode, or specify the version as its first argument.p  pSee also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4062229577438How can I call an older version of a gem from the commandlinea re the underscoreversion notation.p  hr  pstrongOriginal questionstrongp  pI have multiple projects going on using different versions of Rails.  I have a workflow described below for creating projects using specific versions of rails, and keeping the projects isolated from each other.  Id like to experiment with other workflows, in particular, using rbenv instead of RVM, but its not clear how to do so.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong  What is the strongbest current practicestrong for creating multiple rails projects, each using a different version of rails, when making use of strongrbenvstrong and strongbundlerstrong, as opposed to rbenvgemset or rvmp  pstrongUSE CASEstrong  I have two rails projects, called ProjectA and ProjectB.  ProjectA is developed using one version of rails RailsA, whereas ProjectB uses a different version RailsB.  How do I manage having both versions installedp  pstrongTHE GEMSETS APPROACHstrong  When I first started with Rails development, I used a hrefhttpbeginrescueend.com relnofollowRVMa.  In addition to supporting multiple, concurrent installations of ruby, RVM supports having multiple a hrefhttpbeginrescueend.comgemsetsbasics relnofollowNamed Gem Setsa.  Each project has its own independent collection of gems including rails itself called a gemsetp  pre classlangbash prettyprintoverridecodervm gemset create RailsA rvm gemset use RailsA  RailsA.  Note My question is not versionspecific. gem install rails version 3.0 rails new ProjectA cd ProjectA rvm rvmrc use rvm current vi Gemfile bundle install cd ..  Now do the same for ProjectB rvm gemset create RailsB rvm gemset use RailsB gem install rails version 3.2 rails new ProjectB cd ProjectB rvm rvmrc use rvm current vi Gemfile bundle install codepre  pNote The very strongcreationstrong of the project folders should be done IMHO by a coderails newcode command using the emdesired versionem of rails, since the skeleton files change from version to version.  Perhaps I should revisit this premisep  pstrongTHE BUNDLER APPROACHstrong Ive been playing with using a hrefhttpsgithub.comsstephensonrbenv relnofollowrbenva instead of RVM, but I dont understand the workflow as clearly.  In the a hrefhttpsgithub.comsstephensonrbenv relnofollowREADME.mda, Sam Stephenson writes that rbenv does not ... manage gemsets.  Bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies.  There is a plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comjamisrbenvgemset relnofollowrbenvgemseta for getting the same results as rvms gemsets, but Sam clearly favors using Bundler instead.  Unfortunately, he doesnt elaborate on what the workflow would look like.  Even the a hrefhttpgembundler.com relnofollowBundlera website doesnt explicitly connect all the dots of how to isolate one project from another.  Several a hrefhttpquickleft.comblogmanagerubieswithrbenv relnofollowblogsa a hrefhttpsnippets.aktagon.comsnippets532Howtomigratefromrvmtorbenv relnofollowanda a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1384279 relnofollowgistsa come to the rescue, suggesting the following code.bundleconfigcode filep  precode BUNDLEPATH vendorbundle codepre  pBTW, Im not sure what the  is about.  The docs make no mention of it and it doesnt seem to make a difference.p  pThis effectively gives each rails project its own gemset, storing the gems in ProjectXvendorbundle.  In fact, rails itself will be reinstalled there, making the project completely independent of the rest of my environment, once I run codebundle installcode.p  pstrongBut the emelephant in the roomem is the chickenandegg problem of creating the rails project folder in the emfirst placeemstrong   In order to create the ProjectA folder using RailsA, I need to install rails and its numerous dependencies emfirstem.   But when I want to create ProjectB, I must then switch to using RailsB.  Without gemsets, I must do some serious upgradingdowngrading.  Not cool.p  pA possible solution is simply not to worry about what version of rails I use to create the ProjectX folder.  If I then use rails 3.0 to create a 3.2 project, I could just manually create the appassets tree.  But that just irks me.  Aint there a better wayp

Negative 3437 pIm sure Ive seen the answer to this, but cant find it after many minutes of digging.  It should be an easy one to answer...p  h2motivationh2  pIn the console, you can invoke the codegetcode method with a path argument, such asp  precodeapp.get postspath321 codepre  pThis invokes codeActionDispatchIntegrationRequestHelpersgetcode, which converts posts321 into the appropriate controller and action and parameters, e.g. controller  posts, action  show, id  321.p  pBut you cant do that in controller tests.  To get the same effect, youd needp  precodeget show, id gt 321 codepre  pThis is because the codegetcode method is defined by codeActionControllerTestCasegetcode, which expects the action and parameters to be already parsed out.p  pI can write my tests where I manually fill in controller, action and any parameters, but that seems like a good way to introduce errors.p  h2the questionh2  pIs there a method that will parse a string e.g. the invocation of codepostspath321code into the appropriate controller, action and parameters, suitable for passing to codeActionControllerTestCasegetcodep  pIt would make writing tests simpler and less errorprone.p  p[EDIT I realize that you need the HTTP verb codegetcode as well as the path codeposts321code to uniquely map to the controller and action, but the question still stands...]p

That is why neither HTTP authentication, neither secret API key, neither RSA keys exchange are not suitable for this type of API, because the service needs some authentication parameters to receive and the only way to do that is to pass them via AJAX using the JSON format. So, everyone, who knows how to look in the source code of the page, can simply copy those parameters and use them every way they want to.p  pThe variant with IP restriction is not suitable too, at least because the sitepartner can be hosted on the sharedhosting.p  pI thought to use some API key with some unclear hash clear only for the service  timestamp. But this method will become clear sooner or later.p  pAnyway, everything that comes to mind is not fully suitable. Maybe someone has faced that problem Will appreciate any answers.p

Negative 3437 pI am creating a base architecture for a gaming system. I need it to be messagebase for scaling and failover. It also uses sockets for publishersubscriber notification of messages. My challenge is should I go with what I have or use a fullblown ESB like nServiceBus or MassTransitp  pHere is what I have so far, its a bit complicated. First of all, it is a poker system.p  ol lipClients connect to a socket to receive messages. The messages are then dispatched to one or more local table queues. There of course can be more than one client.pli lipCard dealer clients, running on the back end, also connect via a different socket. There can be more than one dealer.pli lipRobotic clients, running on the back end, also connect via a different socket. There can be more than one robotic client.pli lipEach client and dealer creates a subscriber record in the database.  This indicates what their IP is, and ultimately what tables they are connected to.pli ol  pOverviewp  pDifferent clients can connect to different sockets, but be subscribed to the same table. Therefore, any messages directed to one table may possibly be handled by more than one socket in order to ensure that the message goes out on a pertable basis.p  pHow I accomplish this is I have a Message table and a ControllerMessage table.  The ControllerMessage table keeps track of all the messages handled by a particular Controller. I use a simple LEFT OUTER JOIN to determine messages needing to be sent by a particular Controller.p  pThe system works great. Failover is very fast and efficient since asynchronous sockets are immediately notified when the other party disconnects or goes down unexpectedly.p  pBut... Is there a btter way than building my own ESB I am even doing some things a message enrichment and adaptation, which an ESB could provide although I would have to create code or XSLT schemas.p

Negative 3437 pFor some reason I cannot get the Net.Pipe endpoint EP of my service working.p  pThis is a .Net 4.0 WCF Service hosted in IIS7.p  pThere are two faults...p  ul liFirstly the EP will not provide meta data.li liSecond the EP will not actually work  I am testing it via the WCF Test Client which is part of VS2010.li ul  pI think both are actually related to the same problem.p  pThe actual error received is...p  pcodeThere was no endpoint listening at net.pipe[machinename].[domainname]ServicesTestService.svc that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details.codep  pThe first thing I have noticed is that no matter what I call my pipe in the base addresses it gets renamed to [machinename].[domainname] which seems strange. This is evident in the service Meta data that is output. However, if I use my pipe name or this renamed name in the test client neither will work.p  pI have also, enabled WAS in Windows Features, set the site bindings for all protocols in IIS and also typed in the names of the protocols in the Enabled Protocols box in IIS http, net.tcp, net.pipe. I have also checked that the Net.Pipe listener adaptor is started in Windows Servics.p  pMy http and net.tcp EPs both work fine and return Meta Data.p  pMy config is listed below  has anyone got any idea what could be stopping this EP from working Im pretty sure its something simplep  precode ltsystem.serviceModelgt     ltbehaviorsgt       lt EP Behaviors gt       ltendpointBehaviorsgt         ltbehavior namePayloadMessageInspectorgt           ltMessageHeaderBehavior gt           ltMessagePayloadBehavior gt         ltbehaviorgt       ltendpointBehaviorsgt       lt Service Behaviors gt       ltserviceBehaviorsgt         ltbehavior nameGenericServiceBehaviorgt           ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultstrue gt           ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledtrue policyVersionPolicy15  gt         ltbehaviorgt       ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehaviorsgt     lt Bindings Section gt     ltserviceHostingEnvironment multipleSiteBindingsEnabledtrue gt     ltbindingsgt       lt Basic Http Binding gt       ltbasicHttpBindinggt         ltbinding maxReceivedMessageSize10485760 maxBufferSize10485760 maxBufferPoolSize10485760gt           ltsecurity modeTransportCredentialOnlygt             lttransport clientCredentialTypeWindows gt           ltsecuritygt         ltbindinggt       ltbasicHttpBindinggt       lt Net TCP Binding gt       ltnetTcpBindinggt         ltbinding maxReceivedMessageSize10485760 maxBufferSize10485760 maxBufferPoolSize10485760 gt                ltnetTcpBindinggt       lt Net Pipe Binding gt       ltnetNamedPipeBindinggt         ltbinding maxReceivedMessageSize10485760 maxBufferSize10485760 maxBufferPoolSize10485760 gt       ltnetNamedPipeBindinggt           ltbindingsgt     lt Services Section gt     ltservicesgt             lt Membership Service gt       ltservice nameTestService behaviorConfigurationGenericServiceBehaviorgt         lthostgt           ltbaseAddressesgt             ltadd baseAddresshttplocalhostServicesTestService.svc gt             ltadd baseAddressnet.tcplocalhostServicesTestService.svcgt             ltadd baseAddressnet.pipeDevServicesTestService.svcgt           ltbaseAddressesgt         lthostgt         lt HTTP gt         ltendpoint            address            bindingbasicHttpBinding            contractITestService nameTestServiceBasicHttp behaviorConfigurationPayloadMessageInspector gt         lt NetTCP gt         ltendpoint           address           bindingnetTcpBinding           contractITestService nameTestServiceNetTcp behaviorConfigurationPayloadMessageInspector gt         lt NetPipe gt         ltendpoint           address           bindingnetNamedPipeBinding           contractITestService nameTestServiceNetPipe behaviorConfigurationPayloadMessageInspector gt         lt Mex Net.Tcp  Net.Pipe  gt         ltendpoint nameTestServiceNetTcpMex addressmex bindingmexTcpBinding contractIMetadataExchange gt         ltendpoint nameTestServiceNetPipeMex addressmex bindingmexNamedPipeBinding contractIMetadataExchange gt       ltservicegt     ltservicesgt     lt Extensions gt     ltextensionsgt       ltbehaviorExtensionsgt         ltadd nameMessageHeaderBehavior typeServiceMessageHeaderBehavior, TestService.Logging gt         ltadd nameMessagePayloadBehavior typeServiceMessagePayloadBehavior, TestService.Logging gt       ltbehaviorExtensionsgt     ltextensionsgt      ltsystem.serviceModelgt  codepre

But, I was able to update even by given just test in the update attribute. So my question here is when should I use the  in the id or is it mandatory or is there any pre defined rule to give the ids in the attributep  pAlso, I am aware of the fact that the id given in the update attribute is through the UINamingContainer in which it is placed. Please pardon me if its trivial, I am really confused here.p  pAny help greatly appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 3437 pOk, Im not sure if the topic was clear enough. Im making a Flash based single player game. It is an executable AIR app, to be installed and ran directly, not to be played on a browser. So, I have tons of images, videos and stuff and recently I started to load them externally using the Loader class. Published AIR installer dont mind about external stuff though, so I copy them manually after installation. This is probably wrong from the beginning, but I dont know how to incorporate them. Ill maybe figure it out later somehow, this is not the main issue but if you answer this Ill be double thankful.p  pAnyway, the real question is, I dont want players to see images and videos used in the game stored in resource folders. Is there a way I can make them encrypted or hidden in some packagelike file like .DAT files in many grand games So they cannot be accessed or messed up with, by common players. And of course, still I should be able to load them in runtime.p  pI looked up to this .SWC format. But, I dont think its what Im looking for. Anyone could easily import that file to a Flash project.p

Negative 3437 pFor input text files, I know that .seek and .tell both operate with bytes, usually  that is, .seek seeks a certain number of bytes in relation to a point specified by its given arguments, and .tell returns the number of bytes since the beginning of the file.p  pMy question is does this work the same way when using other encodings like utf8 I know utf8, for example, requires several bytes for some characters. p  pIt would seem that if those methods still deal with bytes when parsing utf8 files, then unexpected behavior could result for instance, the cursor could end up inside of a characters multibyte encoding, or a multibyte character could register as several characters. p  pIf so, are there other methods to do the same tasks Especially for when parsing a file requires information about the cursors position in terms of characters.p  pOn the other hand, if you specify the encoding in the open function ...p  blockquote   pinfile  openfilename, encodingutf8p blockquote  pDoes the behavior of .seek and .tell changep

Negative 3437 pIve just finished skinning an xcart for a client and he has dropped me an email letting me know that he has been speaking to an iPhone dev company who are going to build a social networking app on top of Drupal for him.p  pHe wants to know if xcart will be able to share data from Drupal and vice versa. In particular, they want a registration on one platform to be accessible by the other, this could also go so far as either site accessing information about shopping habits or social interactions to push featuresproducts of the other system etcp  pThis is my first time touching xcart and I have zero experience with Drupal, however, I have done a little research and Ive seen there is an ecommerce module for Drupal. As the xcart system is not live and is now on hold until the app has launched, would it be quicker, easier, cheaper in dev hours and more future proof to scrap what we have already done with xcart and just reskin the store on the Drupal ecommerce modulep

Negative 3437 pI am developing an application where i have a main activity consisting on the left of a fragment showing products. Depending on the selection, the right part of the landscapeview shows detailed information, where the products properties can be thoroughly specified. This is the case if the applications running in landscapemode. If the orientation changes to portraitmode, then the user first selects a product and then specifies the products properties by individual dedicated activities, where each activity contains exactly one fragment of the previously mentioned landscapeview. p  pThe problem now comes when I rotate my screen during runtime. Assume that I started the application in portrait mode, and I select the first product Activity A, Fragment A. The next screen separate Activity, call it Activity B will contain a Fragment B where I can specify Property 1 of the product. Now I rotate the screen. The application will then show the landscapeview where the first product is selected, and ALL fragments dedicated to product configuration are shown at the right. Is there a solution that I can retain the configurations done by the user in the separate activity i.e. Fragment B, Activity B in such a manner that the landscape view receives the state such that the details view can properly show the hitherto done configurationsp  pTo summarizep  pI am in Activity A, just containing a list of products Fragment A I select the first then I get to a new Activity B, where Fragment B is shown then I rotate my screen then I get back to Activity A, now containing at the left side Fragment A the list and at the right side among others Fragment B. I want the state of Fragment B in Activity B be available in Activity A, Fragment B.p  pHope I could completely specify my question.p  pTIA Geraldp

Negative 3437 pI read something about the emSyncRoot patternem as a general rule to avoid deadlocks. And reading a question of a few years ago see this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions728896whatstheuseofthesyncrootpatternlinka, I think I understand that some uses of this pattern may be incorrect. In particular, I focused on the following sentences from a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combbradaarchive2003092850391.aspx relnofollowthis topica p  blockquote   pemYoull notice a SyncRoot property on many of the Collections in System.Collections. In retrospeced, I think this property was a   mistake... Rest assured we will not make the same mistake as we build   the generic versions of these collections.emp blockquote  pIn fact, for example, codeListltTgtcode class doesnt implements codeSyncRootcode property, or more correctly it is implemented explicitly see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4067371this answera, so you must cast to codeICollectioncode in order to use it. But a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions728896whatstheuseofthesyncrootpatterncomment13873399728934this commenta argues that making a private codeSyncRootcode field public is as bad practice as locking on codethiscode see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions251391whyislockthisbadthis answera, as also confirmed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3910628anydownsidestolockingacollectionvsasyncrootcomment41688733910716this commenta.p  pSo, if I understand correctly, when I implement a non threadsafe data structure, since it could be used in a multithreaded context, I should not actually, I must not provide the codeSyncRootcode property. But I should leave the developer who will use this data structure with the task of associating it with a private SyncRoot object as in the following sample code.p  precodepublic class A      private MyNonThreadSafeDataStructure list     private readonly object listSyncRoot  new object      public Method1              locklistSyncRoot                       access to list private field                    public Method2              locklistSyncRoot                       access to list private field                codepre  pIn summary, I understood that the best practices for synchronizationlocking should be as followsp  ol liAny private SyncRoot objects should not be exposed through a public property in other words, a custom data structure should not provide a public codeSyncRootcode property see also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6525118whylockoncollectionsyncrootinsteadofjustlockthecollectioncomment76820306525218this commenta.li liIn general, it is not mandatory to use private objects for locking see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3910655364056this answera.li liIf a class has multiple sets of operations that need to be synchronised, but not with each other, it should have multiple private SyncRoot objects see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3910628anydownsidestolockingacollectionvsasyncrootcomment41720923910656this commenta.li ol  pIs what written above the proper use of this patternp

When I place a div for top right after the body tag, the anchor only takes me to the beginning of content on the page, not the actual top.

Negative 3437 pIm trying to show or not show links based on a users access level. The links will be different depending on the section of the site the user might be in. The links also may not all be in one menu. They will more than likely be in various places on the page.p  pCurrently I have a database table that contains Users, Groups and Sections. The main menu is built from the Sections database table. Im thinking I should create an Actions table and add a link that Id like to show for each section in the action menu.

Negative 3437 pIve created a web app for sales people to use on their iPads at my work by using WordPress  GravityForms and optimizing the css for iPad displays. Using the plugin Gravity Forms PDF Extended I was able to output the captured data onto one of our service contract PDFs I opened the PDF in photoshop and made the background transparent and saved it as a gif, but I cant seem to use ifelseifelse statements.

Negative 3437 pI am trying to port a WinForms app for use with Mono, and Ive recently noted that calling Form.Show from another form will either do nothing or cause the new form to flash and disappear.

Any idea why this doesnt work I cant use ShowDialog because my program relies on events fired by completed async tasks, and I dont want to block a ton of extra threads that will be done right after the Show call.p

Negative 3437 pemI have a two dimensional array and I want to know how I can refer to the rows and columns in it. Do I use [row,column] or [column,row] I also have some graphics. Do I calculate the x,y coordinate set of each graphic with rowsize,colsize or with colsize,rowsizeemp  pThe whole two dimensional array is the building instructions for the grid. Each element in the array refers to a piece of the grid. I know how to construct this grid and its pieces and I know how to access and manipulate the arrays elements.p  pThe problem is that when I construct the grid I have to calculate the x and y coordinate of each piece, but I just dont know if my variable curRow should be used for the x or y coordinate. Its similarly with the variable curCol.p  pMy code is working, but it confuses me. I think of it like the rows control the y coordinates and the columns control the x coordinates, because I just learned of the way matrices are referred to.

So my code generates twoor more identical codes in the same transaction and the Unique constraint in the DB complains about it.p  pI thought of checking the database after each entry, but it is extremely time consuming, considering were talking about 10000 or sometimes more entries.p  pSo now I think the only option is to modify the code that generates them in the first place, cause it seems to be inefficient and generate doubles.p  pA big part of the problem is the required length of the codes, otherwise I would go with pure uniqid or something similar, but since I have to restrict it to 7 characters I guess that makes it a lot worse. Also, I have to exclude some characters from the code[labeled problemcharacters] in the code.p  pHeres the code, I couldnt modify it properly to generate unique values only.p  precodeproblemcharacters  array0, o, O, I, 1, 1  code  md5uniqidrand, true  extId  strtoupperstrreplaceproblemcharacters,rand2,9,substrcode, 0, 7  insert extId in the database codepre  hr  pGeo Ok, I tried your solution and it was working of course, but then I got a new problem  in the else part of your if Im doing the followingp  precodeextId  strtoupperstrreplaceproblemcharacters,rand2,9,substrcode, 0, 7  whiletrue             ifinarrayextId, allExternalIdsHandled ampamp inarrayextId, newEnteredValues        break         else  extId  strtoupperstrreplaceproblemcharacters,rand2,9,substrcode, 0, 7                    insert the modified value in the DB here codepre  pSo, now its entering an endless loop and its not breaking out with the break command even though it ought to be changed with the execution of the random call and then enter the if and break out...p  pI do not see the problem here. Can someone give me some direction, pleasep  pEDIT It sometimes hangs, sometimes does not. I just entered 10000 values and got two entries modified via the else path. I observed this using logs.p

Negative 3437 pAs I understand Progressive Enhancement, one of the basic tenets is the web site should be functional for emeveryoneem, regardless of browser version or settings.  p  pThe suggested breakdown Ive seen isp  ul liHTML content layer using semantic markupli liCSS Presentation layerli liEnhancement layer typically through JavaScript or a JS library like JQueryli ul  pIm a bit confused over the proper way to handle the HTML content layer, however.  In particular, the semantic markup.p  pI keep seeing that HTML5 tags such as nav, article, footer etc. are the ideal method of maintaining this semantic markup for PE.  However, many older browsers do not support HTML5 tags.  The easy way to get around this is to use CSS to set default stylings to  display block  for the HTML5 tags, but this only works with some browsers.  The dreaded IE6, for example, does not recognize HTML5 elements.p  pThe typical workaround for this is to use javascript to dynamically create the missing elements directly into the DOM such as through an HTML5 shiv.p  pHowever... if the client is running an environment that doesnt recognize HTML5 elements, strongandstrong they do not, for whatever reason, accept javascript, how do you incorporate HTML5 semantic tags in support of Progressive Enhancement, without failing to render properly for scriptless browsers that dont recognize the tags  Is this possible, or do you have to leave those browsers out of your design consideration which seems counter to the PE ideals p

Negative 3437 pLiterally, I have been asked this question The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,   the first two terms are 0 and 1, and each term thereafter is the sum of the two preceding terms  i.e., Fib[n]  Fib[n  1]  Fib[n  2]. Using this information, write a C program that calculates the nth number in a Fibonacci sequence, where the user enters n in the program interactively. For example, if n  6, the program should display the value 8.p  pThanks for the answers to the previous question, I have put it into my full code.

Negative 3437 h2Backgroundh2  pIm currently trying to extend Junit org.eclipse.jdt in order to do some tracing. Therefore I created my own plugin project which among others provides a class which should be used by the junit runtime plugin.p  pI have setup my project as a dependency for junit and the package containing my class is listed as exported in my Manifest in the runtime tab. If I run the plugins as an eclipse application everything builds and starts allright and.p  h2Problemh2  pHowever, if in the started eclipse I perform a Run as Junit, I get a NoClassDefFoundError concerning my class. In my understanding this means, that at runtime my class is not visible in the started eclipse. I thus printed the classpath while running and like expected my plugin doesnt show up.p  pDo I have to add my plugin to the runtime settings of the junit plugin In the Manifest, my package is not available under the export  add button. I tried importing a jar of my plugin and configuring those exports manually here, but this did not help either.p  pMy thought process kind of gets stuck with this run in run configuration...

Negative 3437 pI have a web app that stores videos. I am using a java servlet over https which verifies a username and password. Once the details are verified, i redirect the user to a video stored in AWS S3. For those who dont know how S3 works, its just a web service that stores objects basically think of it as storing files. It also uses https. Now obviously to make this work, the s3 object file is public. Ive given it a random name full of numbers and letters.p  pSo the servlet basically looks like thisp  precodevoid doGetrequest, response    if authenticateUserrequest.getParameterUsername, request.getParameterPassword       response.sendRedirecthttpss3.amazonaws.commyBucketxyz1234567.mp4      codepre  pThis is obviously simplified but it gets the point across.

Negative 3437 pI wrote simple raytracer using MS VS 2008 SP1 and SSE intrinsics. When I turn O2 optimization for x86 platform it speeds up 3 times. Obviously I would like to use it for x64 too.

Negative 3437 pDue to performance reasons, I have a custom made table. The table consists of columns that are created as HTML DIVs, and the row is wrapped into an AbsolutePanel. The position of the columns and the rows is absolute and calculated on the render loop. The table is added into a ScrollPanel and only renders the visible portion of the rows, and adds rows when the user scrolls.p  pCustomer requirement is to open a PopupPanel to show details about the row when the row is clicked. Ive added a ClickHandler to the row panel by sinking the click event into it, which works fine. p  pThe problem is, if I add e.g. a standard link or any clickable item into one of the cells in the table, clicking on the said items results in also the row click handler firing, which I want to somehow prevent. The source of the event is the row Element, not the linkiconwhatever that was clicked.p  pAny help solving this perhaps a completely different approach  is much appreciated.p

Negative 3437 pI have been learning a lot about frameworks recently and I have hopped between so many. But as I am revisiting PHP after many years, I was completely confused by the OOP adoption. Further, the MVC concept destroyed my entire understanding of programming and initiation in PHP.  p  pI am recovering the best I can, but as I have settled on to Yii, I am wondering why frameworks must start with a frontend controller index.php that calls subcontrollers that put together views and models.  This pattern seems topsy turvy.p  pMy idea for an easily understood framework is to start with a view that incorporates any particular controller which optionally calls up a model. The view would be directly initiated. And this concept makes things more compatible for IDEs.  emRun the view directlyemp  pstrongDoes anyone know of a framework that works like this  If I were to change Yii or any framework to work like this, what problems would I face, in terms of designstrongp
Negative 3437 pI am trying to embed a a hrefhttpraphaeljs.com relnofollowRaphaelJSa paper into qooxdoo widget. RaphaelJS is a SVG drawing library for JavaScript, and it needs to bind to a HTML codeltdivgtcode prior to any drawing. For that, I call codenew qx.ui.embed.Htmlltdiv idraphaelgtltdivgtcode and add it to my widget. After that, I should initialize Raphael by passing the div ID to it.p  pProblem is that codeltdiv idraphaelgtcode is not committed to the DOM model i.e., no real DOM element is created right after codeqx.ui.embed.Htmlcode constructor call. The DOM element creation is indeed deferred until the widget is painted to the screen. Ive managed to catch an codeappearcode event for the widget, and, after that, elements existence is guaranteed, and I can initialize Raphael library and do some drawing.p  pThis approach assumes that I have to run all my application logic from within that codeappearcode event handler, which is probably not what I want. Is there any other way to get a widget in its readyfordrawing state in the main application flowp

I also need precise control over my Begin Transaction and CommitRollbackSet Transaction. p  pAre the above mentioned SQL Native facilities likely to be deprecated and removed in future EF versionsp  pAm I better off using ADO.Net and forget about using EF  Or perhaps ADO.Net will eventually get deprecated in favour of EF so I should stick to DbContext despite using mostly native SQL accessp  pthank you in advancep

Negative 3437 pI have a custom user control in a scrollviewer, and the content of the scrollviewer is larger than the scrollviewer size.  If I scroll to the end of the data, and then resize the window, the usercontrol does not redraw because the usercontrols size did not change. How can I force the usercontrols size to change in response to the scrollviewers change in size p  pI was trying to do it by manually finding the control and changing the size in the code behind when it was in an itemscontrol, but now that i switched to treeview I cant seem to figure out how to find the control. p  pSo I was thinking what I basically want is for the resize to affect the user control in scrollviewer. I was thinking that I could either make some sort of command to send to the child control, or the easier thing is to just create an event handler for scrollviewers SizeChanged event that again manually finds the child control and updates its size and redraws the signals.  Do I have any other options p

Negative 3437 pI am working with a treepanel in ExtJS 4.2.1. I used to set modifications on dom elements precisely change the class name with the listener codeafteritemexpandcode when I expand nodes of my tree. In fact it was to have leaves with even index with a different color than leaves with odd color. It worked fine. Getting the ids of the items which interest me, I can access them, and then modify the className. I did the same way for another tree but the problem is that when I create this tree I expand it with an codeexpandAllcode, so the listener codeafteritemexpandcode is not called. I need this codeexpandAllcode, but I need the codeafteritemexpandcode listener too. The reason I use this listener is because I have an easy access to item.id with the prototype  codeafteritemexpand node, index, item, eOpts code.

Negative 3437 pI just condider using GridX as grid component in my application. I try to find out how to configure some things. p  pAt first I want to hava grid that would have full width of viewport, that would have a few columns with fixed width, but all others would adapt to the viewport. p  pIn normal table I set width to 100 to the table, width to fixed columns, and minwidth to autoresize columns. But here I cant find an example.p  pThere is a demo testgridcolumnwidth.html, but it doesnt have the features I want. The Grid of autoWidth is wider that viewport at start.p  pAfter changing the width attribute of .gridx and .gridxBody, the grid is adapted to viewport, but the columns are not adapted and some of them dissapear.p  pWhen I follow a hrefhttpsgithub.comoriagridxwikiIntroductiontoGridx relnofollowhttpsgithub.comoriagridxwikiIntroductiontoGridxa and set code.gridx width100code, the grid container is adapted to viewport, there is scroll, but the columns are neither shrinked nor expanded. p  pOK, I think my requirement is quite basic. So how to do that with GridX Am I missing somethingp

In reallife usage, you wouldnt want to immediately prompt someone to login         like this, for two reasons        1 JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they         result from direct interaction from people using the app such as a mouse click        2 it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.       FB.login      else         In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login         function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication        of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login        dialog right after they log in to Facebook.

Negative 3437 pI have  Cassandra 1.2.6 cluster running on datacenter A, each node has a solid state drive with somewhat limited space aprox 50 of disk space is free.p  pNow I need to implement somehow a way of having automatic backups of each node. Ideally I want to have a way of moving all of the clusters datafiles to a different disk standard cheaper disks, or even to a different server in the same datacenter A and possibly moving all the data once in a while to a datacenter B in a different location.p  pFrom what Ive read I can use snapshots on each node to get the files to copy using whatever tool I want and in this case I have the option to move the data to a different diskserverdatacenter.p  pMy question is, since each of my nodes is about 50 full, taking a snapshot will consume all that space or the hard links will consume way less space than I anticipate, if so, is there a better way of doing this, maybe with an already made tool, or everything should be custom made when it comes to this type of backups in Cassandrap  pThanks in advancep

Which makes sense because my event is .common click.p  precode .common.clickfunction           var currentID  this.attrid         alertcurrentID            ltdiv idaccordiongt              lth3gtProject Typelth3gt      ltdiv id1 classcommon styleheight150pxgt      ltdivgt      lth3gtAmmenitieslth3gt     ltdiv id2 classcommon styleheight150pxgt       ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pI need to figure out how I can get div id on header click. Accordion doesnt play very nicely so if i switch my id and class onto the header, the event doesnt fire. Ive tried using codeaccordion .common.clickcode and this doesnt work either p
Negative 3437 pWe are embedding a Google Maps street view in our OpenLayers  ExtJS application. For all the browsers, it seems quite fast, except for IE8, specially in slower workstations, where it gets slow and the panning is not smooth at all.p  pSo, using IE8, we go to maps.google.com , ask for a street view, it works fine. Same machine, IE8, go to our ExtJS application and ask for a street view, it is not that smooth, much slower. Same machine, Firefox or even IE9, it is smooth enough. p  pSome thoughts  p  ul liHaving a look with Firebug and Fiddler it seems that the images are properly cached. So it doesnt seem that we are asking for too many requests. I mean, panning is still slow even if we dont perform any image request at all.li limaps.google.com does not need to authenticate as our app does, but for the previous reason, I would not think that is the problem.li liIt is slow no matter we remove additional markers or the map including the pegman besides.li liThis happens even if the window size is not too big. That is, smaller than the window we use for testing with maps.google.com li liI can see a CPU usage when panning of roughly 30 using street view in our application and 15 with maps.google.comli ul  pThe code we use is not very different from the example p  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascriptexamplesstreetviewsimple relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascriptexamplesstreetviewsimpleap  pAny idea will be appreciated. Thanks.p  pUpdate. To simplify the problem, I tried getting rid of ExtJS. So I just open another window with the simple HTML below.

pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI managed to get the CFD code up and running Yay  The problem is that I am on a 64 bit machine but I was using the 32bit version of MSVS2010 express. I didnt realize this and I was trying to use the intel64 libs i.e. ...tbblibintel64vc10. Somehow this issue manifested in linker errors which doesnt really make sense. Anyway, switching to ia32 cleared up that problem, and the project would build.p  pThe next hurdle was the application complaining about some nondescriptive error like There was an error with the program [registry code]. So I ended up trying to run the TBB examples. The examples gave clearer errors when run, saying The tbb.dll file is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program. After some more googling, I found an easy solution move the dll files it was complaining about into the application directory.p  pThen, at long last, the application worked. The visual effect is so worth it. I cant wait to start playing around with this.p

Negative 3437 pIm working on an app where user sends data to a central database using a web service. The web service sends back an XML file with the primary key from the central database so the local database on the app is updated with this primary key.

The adapter used in this example binds       to an ImageView and to a TextView for each row in the list.             To work efficiently the adapter implemented here uses two techniques        It reuses the convertView passed to getView to avoid inflating View when it is not necessary        It uses the ViewHolder pattern to avoid calling findViewById when it is not necessary             The ViewHolder pattern consists in storing a data structure in the tag of the view returned by       getView. This data structures contains references to the views we want to bind data to, thus       avoiding calls to findViewById every time getView is invoked.           public class MainActivity extends Activity           private static class EfficientAdapter extends BaseAdapter              private LayoutInflater mInflater              public EfficientAdapterContext context                   Cache the LayoutInflate to avoid asking for a new one each time.                 mInflater  LayoutInflater.fromcontext                   Icons bound to the rows.                                          The number of items in the list is determined by the number of speeches               in our array.                             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetCount                           public int getCount                  return DATA.length                                          Since the data comes from an array, just returning the index is               sufficent to get at the data. If we were using a more complex data               structure, we would return whatever object represents one row in the               list.                             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetItemint                           public Object getItemint position                  return position                                          Use the array index as a unique id.                             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetItemIdint                           public long getItemIdint position                  return position                                          Make a view to hold each row.                             see android.widget.ListAdaptergetViewint, android.view.View,                    android.view.ViewGroup                           public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent                   A ViewHolder keeps references to children views to avoid unneccessary calls                  to findViewById on each row.                 ViewHolder holder                   When convertView is not null, we can reuse it directly, there is no need                  to reinflate it. We only inflate a new View when the convertView supplied                  by ListView is null.                 if convertView  null                      convertView  mInflater.inflateR.layout.rowlayout, null                       Creates a ViewHolder and store references to the two children views                      we want to bind data to.                     holder  new ViewHolder                     holder.text  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.text                     convertView.setTagholder                  else                       Get the ViewHolder back to get fast access to the TextView                      and the ImageView.                     holder  ViewHolder convertView.getTag                                    Bind the data efficiently with the holder.                 holder.text.setTextDATA[position]                 return convertView                           static class ViewHolder                  TextView text                                Override         public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState             setContentViewR.layout.activitymain             ListView lv  ListView findViewByIdR.id.list             lv.setFocusabletrue             lv.setFastScrollEnabledtrue             lv.setAdapternew EfficientAdapterthis             lv.setOnItemClickListenernew OnItemClickListener                              Override public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt arg0, View arg1,int position, long arg3                                       Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Hello    position, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                                  private static final String[] DATA                   Abbaye de Belloc, Abbaye du Mont des Cats, Abertam,                 Abondance, Ackawi, Acorn, Adelost, Affidelice au Chablis,                 Afuegal Pitu, Airag, Airedale, Aisy Cendre,                 Allgauer Emmentaler, Alverca, Ambert, American Cheese,                 Ami du Chambertin, Anejo Enchilado, Anneau du VicBilh,                 Anthoriro, Appenzell, Aragon, Ardi Gasna, Ardrahan,                 Armenian String, Aromes au Gene de Marc, Asadero, Asiago,                 Aubisque Pyrenees, Autun, Avaxtskyr, Baby Swiss, Babybel,                 Baguette Laonnaise, Bakers, Baladi, Balaton, Bandal,                 Banon, Barrys Bay Cheddar, Basing, Basket Cheese,                 Bath Cheese, Bavarian Bergkase, Baylough, Beaufort,                 Beauvoorde, Beenleigh Blue, Beer Cheese, Bel Paese,                 Bergader, Bergere Bleue, Berkswell, Beyaz Peynir,                 Bierkase, Bishop Kennedy, Blarney, Bleu dAuvergne      codepre
Negative 3437 pSetting codeSESSIONCOOKIESECURE  Truecode in Django tells the browser to only send the session cookie over SSL.  However, if an authenticated user navigates from a secure page to a nonsecure page the session middleware will not know about the secure session since the cookie wont be sent and will set a new session cookie.  The effect is that the user is then logged out, and needs to log in again.p  pFor example, a user might edit something in the secure admin, click view on site, is taken to a nonssl page, then clicks back, only to find that their session has been overwritten, and is no longer authenticated.p  pIm just wondering what the preferred approach would be to solve this issue.p  pAs I can see, there are the following solutionsp  ol lipUse different subdomains for the secure  nonsecure parts of the site.  Force everything on the ssl domain to be ssl.  I know this would probably be the preferred option, but is currently not an optionpli lipUse different django projects and different session cookie names for the secure  nonsecure parts of the site.  Use nginx to proxy to appropriate django project.pli lipCreate a custom middleware based on codedjango.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddlewarecode that manually handles sessions differently depending on secure  nonsecure.  Perhaps even check whether the url is an admin url, and use a different cookie name and cookie path.pli lipSet codeSESSIONSAVEEVERYREQUEST  Falsecode and hope that the user doesnt navigate to pages that use cookies.pli ol
Negative 3437 pRunning into an issue trying to embed a font in Acrobat via mPDF. p  pOpening the PDF in Acrobat one Truetype font is distorted bottom image no matter the font size at 100 magnification.

Negative 3437 pI am working on securing some REST services and I want to support Windows Authentication.  When the HTTP client has sent no authentication credentials my service responds with an Unauthorized response and a WWAuthenticate value of Negotiate.  This prompts the browser to pop a username and password dialog box.  I enter my windows credentials and the request comes back to my service.  This time there is an Authorization header with a Negotiate scheme that has a value which I assume is some form of my windows identity.  How can I take this header value and translate it into a WindowsIdentity object or some other object that lets me know who the authenticated user is  p  pEdit  My logic is actually occurring in a http handler higher up in the webapi pipeline.  p

Negative 3437 pMy goal is understanding the J2EE lifecycle at a highlevel with Spring, Hibernate, and Maven. From much research, I understand that Spring provides dependency injection and Hibernate provides objectrelation mapping with databases. Maven is a tool to improve the builddeployment process from my understanding. With that said, everywhere I search I get more and more lost on configuration files i.e. pom.xml, server.xml, etc., terminology, and alternatives such as Gradle.

Negative 3437 pBased on what I know, AB testing frameworks are for working with websites. For example, you want to know which of bluered color of Buy button will encourage user to click it.p  pSince website information of user interface comes from server, and browsers display it, AB testing is possible. However, since the user interface of mobile applications are native and static, its not possible to implement AB testing in the same manner if Im not mistaken.p  pSo, my question is how to implement an AB testing framework from the databaseservices all the way through to a native mobile application.p  pAny suggestion would be appreciated.

Negative 3437 pI have made a class that creates a codeSortedDictionarycode and fills it with roster information, keyed by date and employee number. In the form class where the roster object is created, I need to get access to the roster lines stored in the codeSortedDictionarycode, to either display them, or print them to a file.p  pIs it possible to create a method in my class that returns a codeStreamcode so that the calling function can more or less access the data in the codeSortedDictionarycode as if it were a filep  pI looked at codeStreamReadercode and codeStreamWritercode, however these require file names in their constructors. I am more or less thinking of a logical file that is attached to the codeSortedDictionarycode and exposed as a stream that looks like a file. The benefit of a stream, as I understand it, would be that the calling function would not need to know the structure of the codeSortedDictionarycode, it could just read until EOF, making it simple to use. Would a codeMemoryStreamcode be applicablep

Negative 3437 pOur URL structure has been evolving quickly and our logs sometimes fill up with 404 errors from users trying to reach old, nonexistent URLs.

The current setup involves some test cases created in SoapUI, but theres a problem.p  pWhen we run these test cases in code C, BCL WebClient, etc., the average time for a request is between 0.1 and 0.15 seconds. These same tests, when run in SoapUI, run for emalmost five seconds.emp  pIm not a SoapUI guy, and our QA guy is actually pretty new to it, too.

Negative 3437 pstrongDESCRIPTIONstrongp  pI am currently designing an architecture for a C multiagent simulation, where agent actions are driven by many modules in their brain, which may read sensors, vote for an action or send messagesqueries to other modules all of this is implemented through the exchange of messages. Of course, modules can have a state.p  pModules run in strongparallelstrong they have an update method which consumes messages and queries, and perform some sort of computation. The update methods return iterators, and have multiple yields in their bodies, so that I can schedule modules cooperatively. I do not use a single thread for each module because I expect to have hundreds to thousands of modules for every agent, which would lead to a huge amount of RAM occupied by thread overhead.p  pI would like these modules to behave like strongruntime pluginsstrong, so that while the simulation is running I can add new module classes and rewritedebug existing ones, without ever stopping the simulation process, and then use those classes to add and remove modules from the agents brains, or just let existing modules change their behaviours due to new implementations of their methods.p  pstrongPOSSIBLE SOLUTIONSstrongp  pI have come up with a number of possible solutions in the last few days, which all have something disappointingp  ol lipCompile my modules into DLLs, load each in a different strongAppDomainstrong and then use AppDomain.CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrap to instantiate the module, which I would then cast to some IModule interface, shared between my simulation and the modules and implemented by each module class. The interface would expose just the SendMessage, the Update and a few other members, common to all modules.p  ul liThe problem with this solution is that calls between AppDomains are much slower than direct calls within the same AppDomain.li liAlso, I dont know the overhead of AppDomains, but I suppose that they are not free, so having thousands could become a problem.li ulli lipUse some strongscripting languagestrong for the modules, while keeping C for the underlying engine, so that there is no assembly loadingunloading. Instead, I would host an execution context for the scripting language for each module.p  ul liMy main concern is that I do not know a scripting language which is strongbigstrong as in python, lua, ruby, js are big, Autoit and Euphoria are not strongfaststrong, strongembeddable into .NETstrong and allows strongstep by step executionstrong which I need in order to perform cooperative scheduling of module execution.li liAnother concern about this is that I suppose Id have to use a runtime context for each module, which in turn would have massive overhead.li liLastly, I suppose a scripting language would be probably slower than C, which would reduce performance.li ulli lipAvoid unloading of assemblies, instead strongrenamingversioningstrong them somehow, so that I can have a ton of different versions, then just use the latest one for each type.p  ul liIm not even sure this is possible due to omonimous types and namespacesli liEven if possible, it would be very memoryinefficient.li ulli lipDo a strongtransparent restartstrong of the simulation, which means pausing the simulation and execution of the scheduler of brainsmodules, serializing everything including every module, exiting the simulation, recompiling the code, starting the simulation again, deserializing everything, catching any exception raised due to the changes I made to the class and resuming execution.p  ul liThis is a lot of work, so I consider it my last resort.li liAlso, this whole process would be very slow at some point, depending on number of modules and their sizes, making it impracticalli ulli ol  pI could overcome this last problem the whole process in solution 4 becoming slow, by mixing solutions 3 and 4, loading many many assemblies with some form of versioning and performing a restart to clean up the mess every now and then. Yet, I would prefer something that doesnt interrupt the whole simulation just because I made a small change in a module class.p  pstrongACTUAL QUESTIONstrongp  pSo here is my questions is there any other solution Did I miss any workaround to the problems of those I found For example, is there some scripting language for .NET which satisfies my needs solution 2 Is versioning possible, in the way I vaguely described itSolution 3p  pOr even, more simply is .NET the wrong platform for this project Id like to stick with it because C is my main language, but I could see myself doing this in Python or something alike if necessaryp

I know this is an issue with the codefloatcode because the header doesnt do it only the content area and the footer.p  pI would like to fix this but not sure what to do. p  pThe website is a hrefhttpneerajmorar.co.uk relnofollowhttpneerajmorar.co.ukap  pIt works perfectly on PC, Linux and I assume the Mac since it works fine on Safari, but not on the iPad.p  pHTML code for index pagep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtml langengt  ltheadgt     lttitlegtNeeraj Morar  Homelttitlegt     ltmeta charsetUTF8gt     ltmeta namedescription contentThis is the personal website of Neeraj Morar.gt     ltmeta namekeywords contentNeeraj, Morar, neerajmorar, neerajmorar.co.uk, personal, website, portfolio, home, computing, information, systems, university, of, west, london, sql, server, web, designgt     ltmeta namegooglesiteverification contentk3NDZl5POUlqaDoEEOTdrX50XrOcQ9nmQr9IFJK1NlU gt     ltmeta namemsvalidate.01 content6F4E786D9BE746A1AC789E62D2C0F961 gt     ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefStyleSheet1.cssgt     ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefmobile.css mediaonly screen and maxdevicewidth 480pxgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery2.0.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgtfunction a, b  if android.mobileavantgobadablackberryblazercompalelainefennechiptopiemobileiphoneodiriskindlelge maemomidpmmpopera mobinipalm osphonepixirepluckerpocketpspsymbiantreoup.browserlinkvodafonewapwindows cephonexdaxiinoi.testa  1207631065903gso4thp50[16]i770s802sa waabacaceroosaikornalavcacoamoianexnyywaptuarchgoasteusattwaudimr s avanbeckllnqbilbrdblacazbrevwbumbbwnuc55capiccwacdmcellchtmcldccmdcompndcrawdaitllngdbtedcsdevidicadmobdocpods12del49aieml2ulerick0esl8ez[47]0oswazefetcflyg1 ug560genegf5gmogo.wodgradunhaiehcithdmptheihipttahp iiphschtc agpsttphuawtci20gomai230iac ibroideaig01ikomim1kinnoipaqirisjatvajbrojemujigskddikejikgt klonkpt kwckyocklenoxilg gklu5054ee[aw]libwlynxm1wm3gam50mateuixomc0121camcrmedircrimio8oatsmmefmo0102bidedot ovzzmt50p1v mwbpmywan10[02]n20[23]n3002n50025n700110necmontfwfwgwtnok6inzpho2imoptiwvoranowg1p800panadtpdxgpg13[18]cphilpireplayucpn2pockrtseproxpsioptgqaaqc0712213260[27]iqtekr380r600raksrim9rovezos55sagemammmsnyvasc01hoopsdksec0147mcndrisghsharsiemsk0sl45idsmalarb3itt5softnysp01hvv sy01mbt21850t6001018tagtlktcltdgtelimtimtmotoplshts70mm3m5tx9up.bg1siutstv400v750verivirgtevk405[03]vvm40vodavulcvx52536061708081838598w3c webcwhitwig ncnwwmlbwonux700xda2gyasyourzetoztei.testa.substr0, 4 window.location  b navigator.userAgent  navigator.vendor  window.opera, httpm.neerajmorar.co.ukltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         document.readyfunction               .content.cssdisplay, none             .content.fadeIn5000             if .header a.clickfunction event                  event.preventDefault                 linkLocation  this.href                 .content.fadeOut1000, redirectPage                          else if .transition.clickfunction event                  event.preventDefault                 linkLocation  this.href                 .content.fadeOut1000, redirectPage                           function redirectPage                  window.location  linkLocation                           ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt     ltdiv classheadergt         ltul classindexgt             ltligtlta hrefindex.htmlgtNeerajMorar.co.ukltagtltligt         ltulgt         ltul classnavgt             ltli classlinksgtlta hrefindex.htmlgtHomeltagtltligt             ltli classlinksgtlta hrefaboutme.htmlgtAbout Meltagtltligt             ltli classlinksgtlta hrefcomputingskills.htmlgtComputing Skillsltagtltligt             ltli classlinksgtlta hrefwebdesign.htmlgtWeb Designltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefcontact.htmlgtContactltagtltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classboxgt         ltdiv classcontentgt             ltdiv classhellogt                 lth2gtHello, Im Neerajlth2gt                 ltpgtBusiness Systems Apprentice at Stanmore College, Student at University of West London, and TIMEs Person of the Year 2006.

Very not ideal...p  pAs Im just getting familiar with wxPython, Im not clear where my eventpipeline is broken and wonder if any of the wizards out there may know which documentation I need to read, or which eventbind I need to learn.p  pThank you muchp  pZackp  pSource codep  precodeusrbinenv python    coding USASCII      generated by wxGlade 0.6.8 on Thu Feb 27 110938 2014     import wx  import matplotlib  matplotlib.useWXAgg  from matplotlib.figure import Figure as fig  from numpy import   from matplotlib.backends.backendwxagg import FigureCanvasWxAgg  from matplotlib.backends.backendwxagg import NavigationToolbar2WxAgg    begin wxGlade dependencies  import gettext   end wxGlade    begin wxGlade extracode   end wxGlade   TIMERID  1000   class EDSLiveViewFramewx.Frame      def initself, args, kwds           begin wxGlade EDSLiveViewFrame.init          kwds[style]  wx.DEFAULTFRAMESTYLE          wx.Frame.initself, args, kwds          self.SpectrumPanel  wx.Panelself, wx.IDANY, stylewx.TABTRAVERSAL  wx.FULLREPAINTONRESIZE          self.FigurePanel  wx.Panelself.SpectrumPanel, wx.IDANY          self.btnLogarithmic  wx.ToggleButtonself.SpectrumPanel, wx.IDANY, Logarithmic          self.notebookSettings  wx.Notebookself, wx.IDANY, style0          self.InstrumentPane  wx.Panelself.notebookSettings, wx.IDANY          self.SamplePane  wx.Panelself.notebookSettings, wx.IDANY           self.setproperties          self.dolayout           self.Bindwx.EVTTOGGLEBUTTON, self.OnLogPress, self.btnLogarithmic           end wxGlade           self.InitMatplotlibFigure           self.DrawFigure          self.Layout           self.Bindwx.EVTSIZE, self.OnSize, self           self.timer  wx.Timerself, TIMERID          self.timer.Start50          wx.EVTTIMERself, TIMERID, self.OnTimer       def setpropertiesself           begin wxGlade EDSLiveViewFrame.setproperties          self.SetTitleframe1          self.SetSize998, 652          self.btnLogarithmic.SetMinSize100, 100          self.notebookSettings.SetMinSize1, 300           end wxGlade       def dolayoutself           begin wxGlade EDSLiveViewFrame.dolayout          sizer1  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL          SpectrumSizer  wx.FlexGridSizer1, 2, 0, 0          FigureSizer  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL          self.FigurePanel.SetSizerFigureSizer          SpectrumSizer.Addself.FigurePanel, 1, wx.EXPAND, 0          SpectrumSizer.Addself.btnLogarithmic, 0, wx.FIXEDMINSIZE, 0          self.SpectrumPanel.SetSizerSpectrumSizer          SpectrumSizer.AddGrowableRow0          SpectrumSizer.AddGrowableCol0          sizer1.Addself.SpectrumPanel, 1, wx.ALL  wx.EXPAND, 2          self.notebookSettings.AddPageself.InstrumentPane, Instrument          self.notebookSettings.AddPageself.SamplePane, Sample          sizer1.Addself.notebookSettings, 0, wx.EXPAND  wx.ALIGNBOTTOM, 0          self.SetSizersizer1          self.Layout           end wxGlade       def OnSizeself, e          self.Canvas.SetSizeself.FigurePanel.GetSize          e.Skip       def OnTimerself, e          self.Canvas.Refresh       def InitMatplotlibFigureself           The figure goes in a FigureCanvas which fills a wxWidgets panel.          self.dpi  100          self.Figure  fig5.0, 4.0, dpiself.dpi          self.Canvas  FigureCanvasWxAggself.FigurePanel, wx.IDANY, self.Figure          self.axes  self.Figure.addsubplot111          self.PlotToolbar  NavigationToolbar2WxAggself.Canvas          self.FigurePanel.GetSizer.Addself.Canvas, 1, flagwx.ALLwx.EXPAND          self.FigurePanel.GetSizer.Addself.PlotToolbar, 0, wx.EXPAND       def DrawFigureself          self.x  arange0,10, 0.01          self.y  sinself.x          self.axes.clear          self.axes.gridTrue           if self.btnLogarithmic.GetValue  True              self.axes.semilogyself.x,self.y          else              self.axes.plotself.x,self.y           self.Canvas.draw          self.Canvas.Refresh        def OnLogPressself, event   wxGlade EDSLiveViewFrame.lteventhandlergt          self.DrawFigure          event.Skip   end of class EDSLiveViewFrame    class MyAppwx.App      def OnInitself          wx.InitAllImageHandlers          MainFrame  EDSLiveViewFrameNone, wx.IDANY,           self.SetTopWindowMainFrame          MainFrame.Show          return 1    end of class MyApp   if name  main      gettext.installapp  replace with the appropriate catalog name       app  MyApp0      app.MainLoop  codepre

Negative 3437 pI am using a visual studio c library project to contain static resources that are needed as deployment artifacts. in my case SQL files that are run with a combination of RoundhousE and Octopus deploy.

It does, as it makes sense, authentication before authorization. It first gets the security context and it shows that the security domain is acctually codemysecuritycode. But then it executes its own authentication which detects a missing principal and sets the unauthenticated identiy which has a valid authentication WAT. As a result the authentication succeeds and the authorization is executed. I still dont get where my login module fits in to that process and how to configure it correctly. This slowly drives me insane by now...p

Negative 3437 pemBackgroundemp  pLinqToObjects has the extension a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb338038.aspx relnofollowmethod codeCountcodea the overload not taking a predicate. Of course sometimes when a method requires only an codeIEnumerableltout Tgtcode to do Linq, we will really pass a richer object to it, such as an codeICollectionltTgtcode. In that situation it would be wasteful to actually iterate through the entire collection i.e. get the enumerator and move next a whole bunch of times to determine the count, for there is a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary5s3kzhec.aspx relnofollowproperty codeICollectionltTgt.Countcodea for this purpose. And this shortcut has been used in the BCL since the beginning of Linq.p  pNow, since .NET 4.5 of 2012, there is another very nice interface, namely codeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgtcode. It is like the codeICollectionltTgtcode except that it only includes those member that emreturnem a codeTcode. For that reason it can be covariant in codeTcode codeout Tcode, just like codeIEnumerableltout Tgtcode, and that is really nice when item types can be more or less derived. But the new interface has its own property, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh881496.aspx relnofollowcodeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgt.Countcodea. See elsewhere a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12622539on SO why these codeCountcode properties are distinct instead of just one propertya.p  pemThe questionemp  pLinqs method codeEnumerable.Countthis sourcecode does check for codeICollectionltTgt.Countcode, but it does not check for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgt.Countcode.p  pGiven that it is really natural and common to use Linq on readonly collections, strongwould it be a good idea to change the BCL to check for both interfacesstrong I guess it would require one additional type check.p  pAnd would that be a breaking change given that they did not remember to do this from the 4.5 version where the new interface was introducedp  pemSample codeemp  pRun the codep  precode    var x  new MyColl     if x.Count  1000000000                var y  new MyOtherColl     if y.Count  1000000000           codepre  pwhere codeMyCollcode is a type implementing codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode but not codeICollectionltgtcode, and where codeMyOtherCollcode is a type implementing codeICollectionltgtcode. Specifically I used the simpleminimal classesp  precodeclass MyColl  IReadOnlyCollectionltGuidgt    public int Count        get            Console.WriteLineMyColl.Count called        Just for testing, implementation irrelevant       return 0            public IEnumeratorltGuidgt GetEnumerator        Console.WriteLineMyColl.GetEnumerator called      Just for testing, implementation irrelevant     return IReadOnlyCollectionltGuidgtnew Guid[]  .GetEnumerator       System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator        Console.WriteLineMyColl.System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator called     return GetEnumerator     class MyOtherColl  ICollectionltGuidgt    public int Count        get            Console.WriteLineMyOtherColl.Count called        Just for testing, implementation irrelevant       return 0            public bool IsReadOnly        get            return true            public IEnumeratorltGuidgt GetEnumerator        Console.WriteLineMyOtherColl.GetEnumerator called      Just for testing, implementation irrelevant     return IReadOnlyCollectionltGuidgtnew Guid[]  .GetEnumerator       System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator        Console.WriteLineMyOtherColl.System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator called     return GetEnumerator       public bool ContainsGuid item  throw new NotImplementedException    public void CopyToGuid[] array, int arrayIndex  throw new NotImplementedException    public bool RemoveGuid item  throw new NotSupportedException    public void AddGuid item  throw new NotSupportedException    public void Clear  throw new NotSupportedException   codepre  pand got the outputp  preMyColl.GetEnumerator called MyOtherColl.Count calledpre  pfrom the code run, which shows that the shortcut was not used in the first case codeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgtcode. Same result is seen in 4.5 and 4.5.1.p  hr  pstrongemUPDATEemstrong after comment elsewhere on Stack Overflow by user codesupercatcode.p  pLinq was introduced in .NET 3.5 2008, of course, and the codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode was introduced only in .NET 4.5 2012. However, in between, another feature, emcovariance in genericsem was introduced, in .NET 4.0 2010. As I said above, codeIEnumerableltout Tgtcode became a covariant interface. But codeICollectionltTgtcode stayed invariant in codeTcode since it contains members like codevoid AddT itemcode.p  pAlready in 2010 .NET 4 this had the consequence that if Linqs codeCountcode extension method was used on a source of compiletime type codeIEnumerableltAnimalgtcode where the actual runtime type was for example codeListltCatgtcode, say, which is surely an codeIEnumerableltCatgtcode but also, by covariance, an codeIEnumerableltAnimalgtcode, then the shortcut was emnotem used. The codeCountcode extension method checks only if the runtime type is an codeICollectionltAnimalgtcode, which it is not no covariance. It cant check for codeICollectionltCatgtcode how would it know what a codeCatcode is, its codeTSourcecode parameter equals codeAnimalcode.p  pLet me give an examplep  precodestatic void ProcessAnimalsIEnuemrableltAnimalgt animals      int count  animals.Count   Linq extension Enumerable.CountltAnimalgtanimals      ...  codepre  pthenp  precodeListltAnimalgt li1  GetSomeHUGEListOfAnimals ProcessAnimalsli1   fine, will use shortcut to ICollectionltAnimalgt.Count property  ListltCatgt li2  GetSomeHUGEListOfCats ProcessAnimalsli2   works, but inoptimal, will iterate through entire Listltgt to find count codepre  pMy suggested check for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltout Tgtcode would repair this issue too, since that is one covariant interface which is implemented by codeListltTgtcode.p  pConclusionp  ol liAlso checking for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltTSourcegtcode would be beneficial in cases where the runtime type of codesourcecode implements codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode but not codeICollectionltgtcode because the underlying collection class insists on being a readonly collection type and therefore wishes to emnotem implement codeICollectionltgtcode.li linew Also checking for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltTSourcegtcode is beneficial even when the type of codesourcecode is both codeICollectionltgtcode and codeIReadOnlyCollectionltgtcode, if generic covariance applies. Specifically, the codeIEnumerableltTSourcegtcode may really be an codeICollectionltSomeSpecializedSourceClassgtcode where codeSomeSpecializedSourceClasscode is convertible by reference conversion to codeTSourcecode. codeICollectionltgtcode is not covariant. However, the check for codeIReadOnlyCollectionltTSourcegtcode will work by covariance any codeIReadOnlyCollectionltSomeSpecializedSourceClassgtcode is also an codeIReadOnlyCollectionltTSourcegtcode, and the shortcut will be utilized.li liThe cost is one additional runtime type check per call to Linqs codeCountcode method.li ol

In strongemFigure1emstrong, JList is not firing any mouse eventsp  pI have a seperate class to handle the Mouse and Key events for the entire window.

How can I store even bigger numbers so I can calculate up to 130 factorial Here are the methods doing the workp  precodepublic class FactorialCalculation      long startTime  System.nanoTime     recursive Factorial method     public long factoriallong number                if number  lt 1         return 1           else         return number  factorial number  1           Now output the factorials of 0 through 15     public void displayFactorials                   Calculate the factorial of o through 15                for  int counter  0 counter lt 130 counter                     System.out.print  Factorial of  counter     factorial counter    n               long estimatedTime  System.nanoTime  startTime              System.out.printlnestimatedTime        end of the method displayFactorials       end of class FactorialCalculation  codepre  pHere is the output showing it turning negative and then to 0.p  precodeFactorial of0 1  Factorial of1 1  Factorial of2 2  Factorial of3 6  Factorial of4 24  Factorial of5 120  Factorial of6 720  Factorial of7 5040  Factorial of8 40320  Factorial of9 362880  Factorial of10 3628800  Factorial of11 39916800  Factorial of12 479001600  Factorial of13 6227020800  Factorial of14 87178291200  Factorial of15 1307674368000  Factorial of16 20922789888000  Factorial of17 355687428096000  Factorial of18 6402373705728000  Factorial of19 121645100408832000  Factorial of20 2432902008176640000  Factorial of21 4249290049419214848  Factorial of22 1250660718674968576  Factorial of23 8128291617894825984  Factorial of24 7835185981329244160  Factorial of25 7034535277573963776  Factorial of26 1569523520172457984  Factorial of27 5483646897237262336  Factorial of28 5968160532966932480  Factorial of29 7055958792655077376  Factorial of30 8764578968847253504  Factorial of31 4999213071378415616  Factorial of32 6045878379276664832  Factorial of33 3400198294675128320  Factorial of34 4926277576697053184  Factorial of35 6399018521010896896  Factorial of36 9003737871877668864  Factorial of37 1096907932701818880  Factorial of38 4789013295250014208  Factorial of39 2304077777655037952  Factorial of40 70609262346240000  Factorial of41 2894979756195840000  Factorial of42 7538058755741581312  Factorial of43 7904866829883932672  Factorial of44 2673996885588443136  Factorial of45 8797348664486920192  Factorial of46 1150331055211806720  Factorial of47 1274672626173739008  Factorial of48 5844053835210817536  Factorial of49 8789267254022766592  Factorial of50 3258495067890909184  Factorial of51 162551799050403840  Factorial of52 8452693550620999680  Factorial of53 5270900413883744256  Factorial of54 7927461244078915584  Factorial of55 6711489344688881664  Factorial of56 6908521828386340864  Factorial of57 6404118670120845312  Factorial of58 2504001392817995776  Factorial of59 162129586585337856  Factorial of60 8718968878589280256  Factorial of61 3098476543630901248  Factorial of62 7638104968020361216  Factorial of63 1585267068834414592  Factorial of64 9223372036854775808  Factorial of65 9223372036854775808  Factorial of66 0  Factorial of67 0  Factorial of68 0  Factorial of69 0  Factorial of70 0  Factorial of71 0  Factorial of72 0  Factorial of73 0  Factorial of74 0  Factorial of75 0  Factorial of76 0  Factorial of77 0  Factorial of78 0  Factorial of79 0  Factorial of80 0  Factorial of81 0  Factorial of82 0  Factorial of83 0  Factorial of84 0  Factorial of85 0  Factorial of86 0  Factorial of87 0  Factorial of88 0  Factorial of89 0  Factorial of90 0  Factorial of91 0  Factorial of92 0  Factorial of93 0  Factorial of94 0  Factorial of95 0  Factorial of96 0  Factorial of97 0  Factorial of98 0  Factorial of99 0  Factorial of100 0  Factorial of101 0  Factorial of102 0  Factorial of103 0  Factorial of104 0  Factorial of105 0  Factorial of106 0  Factorial of107 0  Factorial of108 0  Factorial of109 0  Factorial of110 0  Factorial of111 0  Factorial of112 0  Factorial of113 0  Factorial of114 0  Factorial of115 0  Factorial of116 0  Factorial of117 0  Factorial of118 0  Factorial of119 0  Factorial of120 0  Factorial of121 0  Factorial of122 0  Factorial of123 0  Factorial of124 0  Factorial of125 0  Factorial of126 0  Factorial of127 0  Factorial of128 0  Factorial of129 0  Factorial of130 0  codepre

Negative 3437 pI have a question in regards to page speed of a website. See I have a picture with a original size of 100k that is use in 3 different location in a page. And in the 3 different location the size of the picture is different. The largest size of the 3 location being the 100k pic. When I ran Chrome page speed, it recommends me to serve scale image for the other 2 smaller size location.p  pI would like to ask if the picture has only 1 size of 100K, in 3 picture location does the browser fetch the image from the server 3 times or just oncep  pThis lead to my question now is should I serve scaled image and have more dom elements but reduce page size OR should I serve the 100K image and the the browser fetch only once p  pIf I were to serve scaled image then the browser will have to request for 3 different size of the same image from the server which may increase the time to load rather than reducing it.p

Negative 3437 pi have a question regarding the use of jmeter in a virtualbox.

Now I have already set up the virtualbox and i can Ping in both directions and ive got internet connection, but jmeter still gets a ConnectException when I try to start a remote test.p  pI have disabled the firewall and I am using a networkbridge.p  pHas anybody an idea what could still be missing Thanks in advancep

Negative 3437 pI am currently looking for a way to use the oracle OCI to provide a solution that will allow clients to reset their passwords without knowing the old ones. We are currently using the OCIPasswordChange a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1050101appdev.920a96584oci16100.htm relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1050101appdev.920a96584oci16100.htma to allow passwords to be changed, however this becomes an issue when the user forgets their old password crazy, I know. We would like to provide an admin ability to simply reset their password. I know their use to exist a OCINewPassword call which would instead just set your password to whatever is specified, but this appears to be no longer supported and there is nothing that replaces it. Any help would be appreciated. p

How can I do this in a proper way p  hr  pstrongContextstrongp  pI have development environment in a project that is not very common, I guess. I could develop it in a remote VM, but the Eclipse and the entire machine are so slow that I think is unproductive. Also, I have to use a VPN to connect to the VM, which makes my connection slower. Because of that, I want to develop in my local machine, but, for the build I need to apply this patch in this remote VM to test if the changes were made correctly. I noticed that a patch cant be applied to a unversioned file, for that, I have to clean my entire remote repository with Tortoise and apply the patch again.

Negative 3437 pThis is sort of a followup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq207477421049someone elses questiona about filteringquerying a list of cars.

But what if my filtering query becomes more complicated and I need to use Boolean operators, such asp  precodecolorblue OR typesedan AND doors4 OR colorred codepre  pThat is, I want to find a fourdoor blue car or a fourdoor sedan, but if the car is red Ill take it without caring about any of the other properties.p  pIs there any sort of convention for providing Boolean expressions in a RESTful URIs query parameters I suppose I could by create some new querying expression language and put it in a codePOSTcode, but that seems like a heavy and proprietary approach.

Negative 3437 pi am building an WebApi with ASP.NET. Now i have divided my whole application into few layers and two of them are interfaces and models every one of the layers has its own .dll. In models.dll all my models are defined and at application start injected where their are needed. So far so good. Now i am facing a problem when i am returning values from my controlles. Lets assume the following p  precode public class TestController  ApiController      IBusinessObject businessObject      public TestControllerIBusinessObject businessObject              this.businessObject businessObject           [Routedetailsobjectid]     [HttpGet]     public ISomeObject GetObjectByNrint id                 return  this.businessObject.SearchForObjectid       codepre  pNow when you look at GetObjectByNr you can see that the return type of it is codeISomeObjectcode and of course the return type of this.businessObject.SearchForObjectid is also ISomeObject .The actual implementation of ISomeObject is inside of the ModelLayer but I dont want to include it into my WebApi project, because it shuold only communicate through the interfaces. Now when i run it like this i get an  error which says that i should use a codeDataContractResolvercode and something about serialization. I am aware that i cannot serialize an interface but i thought that my application is smart enough to find the right class to inject here at start i do resolve all the interfaces and that works fine, when calling codethis.businessObject.SearchForObjectidcode the right classes are being called and filled with right values, but just when returning the object at this point, i get the error. I have been looking at SO and found some ways to go for example the codeKnownTypetypeofSomeObjectcode attribute. But when i try to set inside of TestController  it is not being recognized but even if that would work, it would need a reference to my actual model class and i dont want that. p  pIs there any way to make my interface serializable and to return the right object without actually telling my controller what the implementation of ISomeObject is p  pthanksp

Negative 3437 pIm using Guice in a Restlet web server, and theres one pattern I cant figure out how to inject objects that are specific to a certain user or a certain request.p  pSay we have a request to list all the Widgets that belong to a project.

There are many Projects in the system.p  pMy code currently looks something like thisp  precodepublic class WidgetResource extends ServerResource       path projectprojectwidgets      private final WidgetService service     private final ProjectLookup projectLookup      Inject     public WidgetResourceWidgetService service, ProjectLookup projectLookup          this.service  service         this.projectLookup  projectLookup           Get     public WidgetCollection getWidgets          String projectName  getAttributeproject restlet lookup of path var         Project project  projectLookup.getprojectName         WidgetCollection widgets  service.getWidgetsForproject         return widgets        codepre  pThis works well enough, but its clumsy, and I hope theres a better way.  It would be great to inject the correct Project object directly.  Is there a way to do this  p  pSo far Ive explored AssistedInject, which gives a factory object very similar to my Lookup.   I came close to an answer with custom annotationsinjections, but deadended because the Restlet attributes map isnt populated until after injection. Have read the GitHub docs and the Users Guide.

Negative 3437 pin my company we have a webservice zu send data from very old projects to pretty new ones. The old projects run PHP4.4 which has natively no jsonencode method. So we used the PEAR class ServiceJSON instead. a hrefhttpwww.abeautifulsite.netusingjsonencodeandjsondecodeinphp4 relnofollowhttpwww.abeautifulsite.netusingjsonencodeandjsondecodeinphp4ap  pToday, I found out, that this class can strongnotstrong deal with multi byte chars because it extensively uses a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.ord.php relnofolloworda in order to get charcodes from the string and replace the chars. There is no mbord implementation, not even in newer PHP versions. It also uses stringindex to access the char at a index, Im not completely sure if this supports multi byte chars. p  precodeExcerpt from encode method   STRINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN ASCII OR UTF8 FORMAT             ascii               strlenvar  thisgtstrlen8var                           Iterate over every character in the string,              escaping with a slash or encoding to UTF8 where necessary                          for c  0 c lt strlenvar c                   ordvarc  ordvarc                 Here comes a switch which replaces chars according o their hex code   and writes them to ascii codepre  pwe callp  precodeServiceJson  new ServiceJSON data  ServiceJsongtencodeMarktplatz, Hauptstrae, Endingen echo data prints Marktplatz, Hauptstrau00dfe, Endinge.

The issue also occurs in the Android browser, but thats less surprising. There is a circle shaped flash of chord colors at the beginning of the transition.  Its the size of the inner radius and, generally, you can see multiple circles slightly offset.p  pIn my own experimenting, Ive noticed the issue goes away if there are less chords to transition. These diagrams are pretty CPU intensive, more chords means more transitions.  However, my Android tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab III can hardly run this example, BUT the flash of colors does not happen in Firefox for Android. Also, one more data point, if you load this on a new iPad Air 2 the performance is great.  No flashing issue, smooth transitions, etc.p  pAny ideas what the issue is Any workaroundsp

Negative 3437 pI am new to everything arduino related and I have pretty limited experience in circuitry. I picked up an arduino uno a little while ago without a project in mind. I have recently decided on one but require a little guidance.p  pI am attempting to make a clock of sorts using 8 servos that are controlled based on info collected from a php script pulling info from facebook. Each servo turns a gear that controls a hand on the clock8 hands total. Ive looked into a few different wifi shieldsesp8266, cc3000, arduino shield but Im confused on their pin placement. It seems that they take up too much space to be able to use a wifi shield in addition to 8 servos on a single arduino uno So is there any sort of way to fit all 8 servos and a wifi shield on a single arduino uno Also, I realize that the arduino is not going to be able to power the servos alone, therefore needing a separate power supply. Would some kind of wall wart be suitable for this purpose The servos I am looking at operate at 4.86 voltsHiTec HS422. Im not concerned about the programming side of things as I am a developer, but I have been having a tough time with the hardware. Thank you all in advance.p

Negative 3437 pI have a data source that is passing me a hex string such as 11C01 that I need to convert each character in it into an integer or byte value so that I can use it as a bit field i.e. doing things like value  0x01  0 like you would in old Cstyle bit fields. The language for this will be Swift.p  pFor the life of me I cannot find a way to convert a character containing a hex value into an integer without doing some weird roundabout putting into NSData then converting it from there or doing it using C in an ObjectiveC class. Just looking for something in Swift to do this instead of resorting to that.p  pA sample string would be this 11C01 I need it to create an array of bytes or integers like this 0x1, 0x1, 0xC, 0x0, 0x1.p  pThe output should be an int or byte that I can do the bitwise operation on.p  pHow would I go about doing thisp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3437 pI have created a System DSN to connect to an Informix DB.  On top of that I created a SQL Server Linked Server.  I query, successfully, for maybe half an hour, or so, and then it fails.  If I remove and recreate the DSN, it works, again, for a while.p  pAnyone have a clue on why this would be happening  What would cause a System DSN to suddenly change itself or whatever its doingp  pEven if I dont create the Linked Server, I get similar issues.  Once I create the DSN, if I open it, again, it will fail immediately.  The only way to get it working again is to remove it and recreate it.p

Negative 3437 pI copied some of this source code in C, from another web site and tested the neural network by itself with only a few inputs and two outputs and a hidden layer consisting of 4.p  pWhen the neural network gets trained on the expected outputs of a letter, be it A or B or C Which are formatted as a monotone image made up of 16 by 16 pixels Which makes up 126 bytes. I convert the images literal bytes into a byte array, then convert those into a double and I feed the neural network the entire double array as the input, and I give it the expected output. It trains, on just one letter.p  pWhen I train it through other letters, it seems to adjust its weights in a way which make it forget other letters that it learned.p  pHow can I have it so that the weights dont get over written Am I just giving it the wrong expected valuesp  pHere is the code, keep note its from another source but i have heavily modified it. One thing I did was write the train function as well as the test function so that I would have easier access to use that part of the code.p  pThe letter A is supposed to output a 0.99 value roughly on the first neuron in the outputs. The rest of the outputs are supposed to be 0.25p  pThe letter B respectively is supposed to output a 0.99 roughly value on the SECOND neuron in the outputs. The rest of the outputs are supposed to be 0.25p  pHere is the full source code a hrefhttppastebin.com0E3WM42W relnofollowhttppastebin.com0E3WM42Wa It wouldnt let me put code into this because the message body I had was over 33, 000 characters. Anyways Basically the parts I added were the Image loading functions, the image to byte array functions and all that fancy stuff. I was modifying heavily the already existing neural network code example. Luckily the examples given were so modular I didnt have to change the classes at all that support the network Im just having issues adding my own structure as a formality of the network. So any help is appreciated I would really love this network to be able to preserve DIFFERENT information that it learns.p  pI dont know if its something Im doing wrong or if the neural network that I am using simply doesnt support learning multiple things at once it doesnt seem to be very good at giving a variety of output  Thats for sure p

Negative 3437 pOkay so Im new to java and I am trying to a project for varsity. The thing is, I need to make a program that takes inputs from a file, or that can just be pasted into the terminal, but the problem is one of the inputs is a char, for examplep  precode6 N 3 3 H 5 2 1 codepre  pIve tried using stdlib with this codep  precodeint x  StdIn.readInt char Y  StdIn.readChar int z  StdIn.readInt codepre  pbut for some reason the Char input is completely skipped if it is after an Int.

Negative 3437 pWhen I use Bower to install something like codebootstrapsassofficialcode, it installs it in the codebowercomponentscode directory. A component like Bootstrap allows for customization by editing the file codebowercomponentsassetsstylesheetsbootstrap.scsscode. In this case, you simple pick and choose which parts of Bootstrap you want to use for your project.p  pIt is well known that it is most efficient and best practice to leave packages and components like code.bowercomponentscode, code.vendorcode, code.nodemodulescode etc out of source control.

Negative 3437 pThe C99 standard suggests that the type codesizetcode is large enough to store the size of any object, as it is the resulting type of the codesizeofcode operator.p  blockquote   pThe sizeof operator yields the size in bytes of its operand, which may be an expression or the parenthesized name of a type. ...p      pThe value of the result ... is implementationdefined, and its type an unsigned integer type is sizet, defined in  and other headers.p blockquote  pSince codeSIZEMAXcode codeltlimits.hgtcode, if I recall correctly is defined to be the largest value that a codesizetcode can store, it should follow that the largest object would have a size equal to codeSIZEMAXcode.

Its supposed to be a runtime constraint if any standard C function is used with a value greater than codeRSIZEMAXcode as an codersizetcode argument.

Negative 3437 pThis may turn out to be a very easy solution, but I am having an issue connecting to a local PCs database. Specifically, I need PC 1 to connect to PC 2s database through the use of the SQL Server 2012 Management Studio.p  pThe problem arises in that PC 1 is connected to 2 simultaneous networks  one to the internet, and the other directly wired via Ethernet to PC 2. This causes PC 1 to fail in connecting to PC 2, because I assume that PC 1 is trying to connect to PC 2s IP address through the wrong network the one to the internet rather than the right one the direct connection. If I unplug its connection to the internet, then the connection works just fine, since there is only one network to choose from.p  pSo the question is simple how do I define which network to prefer to use while connecting to a server using the SQL Server 2012 Management Studiop

Negative 3437 pI have 2 data structures p  ul lilist, andli lidictionary.li ul  pList holds a bunch of keys. Dictionary has those same keys. As for the value of each key, I want to store the address of corresponding element in the list. What would this achieve For a key, I would lookup the dictionary if the key is present or not. If key is present, then get the address of that element in the list and fetchpopappend that element.p  pMy questionp  pWhat do I store in the dictionary as the codevaluecode of each key using which I can get to that particular element in the list Index of a key will change in the list. For example, I can pop an element out and insert it towards the end. So that makes the index of all the keys change in the dictionary. Hence, storing the absolute index is not what I want.p  pExample of the list, some operation on it and the resultant list. L  [1, 2, 3]p  precodeAdd 4 to list             L  [1, 2, 3, 4] Pop the last unused element L  [2, 3, 4] Use the element 2         L  [3, 4, 2] Pop the last unused element L  [4, 2] Add 1 to the list         L  [4, 2, 1] Add 5 to the list         L  [4, 2, 1, 5] Use 2 from the list       L  [4, 1, 5, 2] codepre  pAs you can see, the position of the elements are changing based on the operations performed. Using dictionary will help to avoid searching the list if I had the stored the address of the element in it.p

Negative 3437 pI am working with an SSIS package in BIDS 2010Visual Studio 2010. I have a script task that calls out to some .NET code. I have placed some breakpoints in this code, and can also see a breakpoint in the SSIS diagram. Whenever I debug the SSIS Package, it opens Visual Studio 2010 and ignores the breakpoints I have placed. p  pFrom what I have I read, I need to set a property on the project called Run64BitRunTime to false. I have done this, but it has no effect on resolving the problem. If I right click the Script Task and select Edit Breakpoints, it shows my breakpoints checked with a Hit Count Type of Always. However to SSIS, always means the exact opposite, because it never hits the breakpoints. p  pI have also tried setting the build to x86 in Visual Studio 2010, but again, that has had no effect. p  pWhere am I going wrong here p  pThanks p

Negative 3437 pI noticed that if I start an Oozie coordinator with a start time many iterations in terms of the frequency previous to the current time, then the coordinator would sequentially run workflows several times, ignoring the assigned frequency. However, for me it is more important that the workflowaction run itself at the assigned frequency, than it is for workflowaction to have run the correct number of times at a given point.p  pIs there any way I can avoid this behavior One way would obviously be to ensure the start time is correct within an iteration time is there a way to have it automatically take the start time. Another would be to configure it to avoid this behavior altogether, and basically run at the next time when it should have given the start time and the frequency.p

Negative 3437 pAlright so I am attempting to get a digital industrial scale to send data to an RS232 wireless device. The RS232 device will then send the data taken from the scale to the website I use at work. I have finally gotten the RS232 set up perfectly to match the details on the scales user manual which can be seen here www.globalindustrial.comsiteimagesuniversalproductextras300625DigitalShippingampReceivingScale.pdf. I know it is set up correctly because the website lists it as a weight value and I am getting data sent from the RS232 to the website. My issue you ask All the data is in hexadecimal. While this would be fine if everyone using the website was an engineer, it makes it a little difficult to read for everybody else. Now, using the RS232 wireless devices user manual which can be found here a hrefhttpww1.microchip.comdownloadsenDeviceDoc50002230A.pdf relnofollowhttpww1.microchip.comdownloadsenDeviceDoc50002230A.pdfa there are tons of options for set opt format except one to change the data to decimal from hex. When the scale is directly connected to the null modem I get no issues the weight data is displayed like you would assume it would. Maybe this is a more difficult task than I think it is, but you would think there would be an option for that right Anyway, I would really appreciate any insight or help anyone has to offer. Thank you.p

Negative 3437 pI never thought this would have been an issue  Using IntelliJ 14.1.4 was using 15.  I removed 15, removed the .IntelliJc15 directory and removed all of my project files and folders the .idea folder and .iml files.  Drastic, but IntelliJ is doing something really screwy with my junit tests and I thought, probably the test version is at fault.p  pSo, I grabbed the latest 14 release.  Installed and tried to import my project.  Something Ive done many times before.p  pCant do it  I get as far in the wizard as the screen Source files for your project have been found. blah blah.  There is no Next button  Just Previous and Finish plus Mark All and Unmark all, Cancel and Help.  So, when I click Finish, all that happens is the .idea folder is created, no .iml files in my modules folders.. rendering my project uselessp  pPreviously, it used to chat about libraries and so on and so forth.  Not now... whats going onp

Negative 3437 pI have an array 1,8760 which represents hourly loads. The loads are the same for each year and i wan to perform calculations for 20 years. So i tried to use repmat, toeplitz and trill in order to have a matrix with the latest load for each time. My main objective is to calculate the moving average using a geometricall scheme basically just calculate each F in the code below. The problem is than i cant use toeplitz for such a big array.
