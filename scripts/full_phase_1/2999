Positive 2999 pI have a controller which is calling a service with codethisgtgetapp.service.myservicecode in many functions handling routes.p  pInstead of fetching that service systematically, I was wondering whether there is a way of being notified that the controller and the services have been created.

Positive 2999 pMy Angular app would be consisted of 2 HTML, 1 controller.js, 1 service.js and 1 state.js. In first html file I have one button. I want on click on the button to transferred to state getExam in state.js, in which the controller would be called with a method getOldestExam, and from that method the service getOldestExam.  First I tried with ngClick, and it is transferring me to getOldestExam controller ok, but the problem I have is that I want the result from the controller to be printed in the second HTMLthe scope of the result to not be lost  I tried a second solution instead of using ng.click I am using uisrefexamuuid, that is changing the state fine in which is the second HTML called, but I cannot call the controller from the State successfully Can someone suggest me a correct approach or solutionp

This property should match one of the ids in my dropdown list.p  pIf I do it like that when I load my page it can never select the correct value. From what I have read it is because it has to compare the two objects and it cannot make the comparison between the object and the guid even though I think I handle that correctly with track by. I might be doing something wrong there.p  pThe page can either have an empty section object because I want to create a new section or an existing section object because I want to update the existing.

Positive 2999 pThis is my first question on StackOverflow and I hope someone can help me. p  pI am planning to build a webapplication backend with spring roo. For the backend I will use Spring and HibernateJPA. In the future I will implement a web client JSFPrimefaces, a mobile client Android and a Windows App.  With spring roo it is easy to create a layered architecture with domain classes, repositories and services. This part is fun. p  pBut now I am thinking about remoting and how to connect all the clients web, mobile, windows with my backend. p  pstrong1. What do you prefer for the remoting between client and backend SOAPWeb Services or a RESTAPI e.g. with JSON.strongp  pstrong2. If RESTAPI How should the API look like for authenticationlogin functionality REST is resourceoriented but how do you implement authentication with REST APIstrongp  pAt the moment I think a RESTAPI is a good idea. Because I am using spring it is easy to create a Spring MVC controller with REST support. But is this the correct way to implement a REST API for all the three devices The web client e.g. should be implemented with JSF and Primefaces and I dont use spring MVC for the web layer. p  pstrong3.Can I nevertheless use Spring MVC controllers to build the REST API together with JSF in the web layer Or is there a better waystrongp

Negative 2999 pIn various IDEs, typing an opencurly results in the appearance of a matched pair of brace characters.  Typically the braces are inserted in some contextsensitive way.  Within a string literal, there is no intervening newline inserted between the braces.  Outside a string literal, there is a newline, and things are indented immediately.  p  precode     cursor  codepre  pAs I continue to type at the cursor, all new code is properly indented.  p  pIn Emacs, though, by default in my ccmode csharpmode, javamode, etc., an opencurly runs selfinsertcommand which just inserts the open brace with no indent.  The closecurly runs celectricbrace, which indents the close curly only, not the full scope.  The result is while I am keying within the curly scope, the indentation is all wrong, and I have to manually reindent the curly scope when it closes.p  pIs there an easy way to get Emacs to behave like the popular IDEs I have used I have written some Emacs Lisp to do, it but it is not very general and I want to know if I am mising something. p  pI know about the skeletonpairinsertmaybe function.  It inserts matched pairs of emwhateverem braces, parens, quotes, angle brackets, square brackets.  But that function doesnt do any contextsensitive indenting and doesnt give me the blank newline.  Is there a way to get it to indent or ... is there another function I should bind to opencurly to get what I want p  pPS my Emacs Lisp looks like this p  precode The default binding for open curly was skeletonpairinsertmaybe.  It  inserts a pair of braces and then does not insert a newline, and does not  indent.  I want the braces to get newlines and appropriate indenting.  I  think there is a way to get this to happen appropriately just within emacs,  but I could not figure out how to do it.  So I wrote this alternative.  The  key thing is to determine if the point is within a string.  In ccmode, this  is at least sometimes done by looking at the font face.  Then, if not in a  literal string, do the appropriate magic.  This seems to work. defun cheesoinsertopenbrace    if point is not within a quoted string literal, insert an open brace, two newlines, and a close brace indent everything and leave point on the empty line. If point is within a string literal, just insert a pair or braces, and leave point between them.   interactive   if        are we inside a string        cgotfaceat point cliteralfaces        if so, then just insert a pair of braces and put the point between them       progn         selfinsertcommand 1         insert          backwardchar               not inside a literal string.      therefore, insert paired braces with an intervening newline, and indent everything appropriately.     progn       selfinsertcommand 1       cindentcommand       newline       insert        cindentcommand       previousline       newlineandindent        point ends up on an empty line, within the braces, properly indented                codepre

Negative 2999 pThis is part observation, part question.br First the observationbr While everyone talks of modular programming, OOP, procedural done right, aspect oriented, design patterns, etc., several popular opensource PHP apps are plain script files with the structure being controlled by codeincludescode and coderequirescode.p  pThis looked stupid to me till I faced a recent issue with my shared web host  they dont support MySQL stored procedures on shared hosting. I checked out many competing shared hosting packages  same story.br Then I rewrote the code using SQL queries and some static functions in DBhandling class.br That was when I realised that the emsaid PHP projects actually take into account the whole spectrum of web hosting packagesem and so decide to keep the code as dumb as possible, so as to reach a wider user base.br The other thing is the reach of the script to newbies without a formal Software Engg background emScripts are easier to hack for newbiesem.p  pThose two were the good reasons I saw to explain the phenomenon.br Make no mistake, the guys maintaining these projects are pretty good at software development, so it is not incompetence.br Sometimes they have spare cash too.p  pNow the question What other sensible reasons can you think ofp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong I personally feel that its not about OOP alone, as pointed out by others, good code structure is not dependent on OOPProcedural style. Ive seen and coded a few  functionsbased PHP projects myself.   p  pThe thing that bothers me most is that the folderfilesystem layout is good, the filefolder naming is great, documentation is plenty, standards are followed, strongbut,strong when you open the file to read the code, theres a hundred ifthenelse conditions, versionchecking, odd use of output buffering here and there, cookie manipulation code, some constants, includes, and no clear structure in many files.   p  pAt least I seem to be lost every time I try reading the code. But if I read code from Java or C code bases, or even some other sidelined PHP apps  there is proper separation of code inside functions, templating is used for display and so on. Looks organised. Looks easily understandable.br Backward compatibility could be strongthestrong issue for maintainers, but they would be open to making the next version in a more structured way. But that too does not happenbr Obviously, Im missing something because those maintainers always work hard, after all.p

Negative 2999 pIm developing a new user store for my organisation and am now tackling password storage.  The concepts of salting, HMAC etc are all fine with me  and want to store the users passwords either salted and hashed, HMAC hashed, or HMAC salted and hashed  not sure what the best way will be  but in theory it wont matter as it will be able to change over time if required.p  pI want to have an XML amp JSON service that can act as a Security Token Service for clientside apps.p  pIve already developed one for another system, which requires that the client doubleencrypts a cleartext password using SHA1 first and then HMACSHA1 using a 128 unique key or nonce supplied by the server for that session only.p  pId like to repeat this technique for the new system  upgrading the algo to SHA256 chosen since implementations are readily available for all aforementioned platforms  and its much stronger than SHA1  but there is a problem.p  pIf Im storing the password as a salted hash in the userstore, the client will need to be sent that salt in order to construct the correct hash before being HMACd with the unique session key.  This would completely go against the point of using a salt in the first place.  Equally, if I dont use salt for password storage, but instead use HMAC, its still the same problem.p  pAt the moment, the only solution I can see is to use naked SHA256 hashing for the password in the user store, so that I can then use this as a starting point on both the server and the client for a more secure saltedhmacd password transfer for the web service.p  pThis still leaves the user store vulnerable to a dictionary attack were it ever to be accessed and however unlikely that might be  assuming it will never happen simply doesnt sit well with me.p  pGreatly appreciate any input.p

Negative 2999 pIm chasing a production bug thats intermittent enough to be a real bastich to diagnose properly but frequent enough to be a legitimate nuisance for our customers.  While Im waiting for it to happen again on a machine set to spam the logfile with trace output, Im trying to come up with a theory on what it could be.p  pIs there any way for competing file readwrites to create what amounts to a deadlock condition  For instance, lets say I have Thread A that occasionally writes to config.xml, and Thread B that occasionally reads from it.  Is there a set of circumstances that would cause Thread B to prevent Thread A from proceedingp  pMy thanks in advance to anybody who helps with this theoretical fishing expedition.p  pbEditb  To answer Pyrolisticals questions the code isnt using FileLock, and is running on a WinXP machine.

Negative 2999 pI have a scenario where I want to dynamically add words of text to a container so that it forms a paragraph of text which is wrapped neatly according to the size of the parent container.  Each text element will have differing formatting, and will have differing user interaction options.  For example, imagine the text  has just spoken out about .  Each word will be added to the container one at a time, at run time. The username in this case would be bold, and if clicked on will trigger an event.  Same with the news article.  The rest of the text is just plain text which, when clicked on, would do nothing.p  pNow, Im using Flex 3 so I dont have access to the fancy new text formatting tools.  Ive implemented a solution where the words are plotted onto a canvas, but this means that the words are wrapped at a particular y position an arbitrary value Ive chosen.  When the container is resized, the words still wrap at that position which leaves lots of space.p  pI thought about adding each text element to an Array Collection and using this as a datasource for a Tile List, but Tile Lists dont support variable column widths in my limited knowledge so each word would use the same amount of space which isnt ideal.p  pDoes anyone know how I can plot words onto a container so that I can retain formatting, events and word wrapping at paragraph level, even if the container is resizedp

Negative 2999 pI want to write a DotNetNuke module that can take an HTML form and parse or transform it into an asp.net form that would then do a HTTPPost to the page specified in the HTML Forms action property. p  pWe regularly run into the need to use preexisting forms from existing sites and Service Providers like Paypal and Constant Contact.

It seems like it should be fairly easy to create an automated way to handle these with ASP.NET.p  pMy quick plan 1. Admin Users will paste the form into a settings page and then click a convert button 2. The code will parse the HTML and generate a ascx User Control from it and store the posting address.

In the user controller functional test, should I just make sure that user.save is called with the appropriate parameters, or should I test that the DB gets a new record  The former seems to call for a stub and assumes that, since Rails is so well tested, the object will be saved successfully if .save is called on the user model.

Negative 2999 pWe were handed a dump file by another team who are gone away for the rest of the year. When we try to import the dump into our own database, we get the following errorp  preIMP00038 Could not convert to environment character sets handlepre  pUpon some research, our speculation is that we have a mismatch between the NLSLANG setting of the source machine and our local machine. We currently dont have any means to check what the value of NLSLANG is on the source machine.p  pSo, having just a dump file in our hands, is there a way to figure out the NLSLANG value with which the export was done From the looks of it, we should be able to override the NLSLANG environment variable before running the import client imp.p  pAnother thing is, the dump was done from an 11g instance and our imp version is 10.

Negative 2999 pI have written a network server class that maintains a stdset of network clients.  The network clients emit a signal to the network server on disconnect via boostbind.  When a network client disconnects,  the client instance needs to be removed from the Set and eventually deleted.

If I comment it out,              everything works fine but I never delete the disconnected NetworkClient.                If actually deleted the client here I might expect problems because it is the caller              of this method via boostsignal and bind.  However, The clientPtr is a shared ptr, and a              reference is being kept in the client itself while signaling, so              I would the object is not going to be deleted from the heap here. That seems to be the case.              Nevertheless, this line makes all the difference, most likely because it controls whether or not the NetworkClient ever gets deleted.             clients.eraseclientPtr              I should probably put this socket cleanup in NetworkClient destructor.

My input is something like thisp  precode0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 codepre  pI would like to get the most nested list inside this list which in this case isp  precode7 codepre  pI did have an idea that I could flatten the list somehow, until there was only one sublist left. To illustrate what I mean, here is a few stepsp  pStep 1.  inputp  precode0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 codepre  pStep 2.  flatten on first levelp  precode0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 codepre  pStep 3.  flatten on second levelp  precode0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 codepre  pNow theres only one nested list left, which means that was the most nested list. But I see a problem here, when two or more such lists would occur. Please share your thoughts on this. p  pIm having problems putting this procedure to reality in Common Lisp, so I would be grateful for some pointers in the right direction, maybe some example code and so on. This is a homework assignment, so I dont really expect a full solution, but would be glad if someone pointed out perhaps an easier and better solution and its implementation.p
Negative 2999 pI am working on an Android app that already exists on iPhone.p  pIn the app, there is a Map activity that has I counted around 800 markers in four groups marked by drawable in four different colors. Each group can be turned on or off. Information about markers I have inside List. I create a mapOverlay for each group, then I attach that overlay to the map. I strongly believe that coding part I did properly. But I will attach my code anyway...p  pThe thing is, my Nexus One cant handle map with all those markers. It takes around 15 seconds just to draw 500 markers. Then when all drawn, map is not quite smooth. It is sort of hard to zoom and navigate around. It can be done, but experience is bad and I would like to see if something can be done there. I know if I avoid String  Double conversion, I could save some time, but I doubt that would be significant.p  piPhone seems doesnt have problems showing all these markers. It takes roughly about 12 seconds to show all of them and zooming and panning is not that bad. Slow down is noticeable but still acceptable. I personally think it is no good to draw all those markers, but app is designed by somebody else and I am not supposed to make any drastic changes.p  pI am not sure what to do here. It seems I will have to come up with different functionality, maybe use GPS location, if known, and draw only markers within some radius, or, if location not known, use center of the screenmap and draw markers around that. I will have to have reasonable explanation for my bosses in case I make these changes.p  pI appreciate if anybody has any idas.p  pAnd the codep  precode    ListltOverlaygt mapOverlays  mapView.getOverlays     Drawable drawable  this.getResources.getDrawableR.drawable.pinblue     drawable  this.getResources.getDrawableR.drawable.pinblue     ArrList  appState.GetSleepArrList     ItemizedOverlay itemizedoverlay  new ItemizedOverlaydrawable, this      ...     ...        for int m  0 m lt ArrList.size m              tName  ArrList.getm.getname.toString             tId  ArrList.getm.getid.toString             tLat  ArrList.getm.getlat.toString             tLng  ArrList.getm.getlng.toString             try                  lat  Double.parseDoubletLat                 lng  Double.parseDoubletLng                 p1  new GeoPoint                         int lat  1E6,                          int lng  1E6                 OverlayItem overlayitem  new OverlayItemp1, tName, tId                 itemizedoverlay.addOverlayoverlayitem              catch NumberFormatException e                  Log.dTAG, NumberFormatException  e                                   mapOverlays.additemizedoverlay         mapView.postInvalidate codepre  p................................ p  precodepublic class ItemizedOverlay extends ItemizedOverlayltOverlayItemgt      private ArrayListltOverlayItemgt mOverlays  new ArrayListltOverlayItemgt     private Context mContext     public HelloItemizedOverlayDrawable defaultMarker, Context context              superboundCenterBottomdefaultMarker         mContext  context           public void addOverlayOverlayItem overlay              mOverlays.addoverlay         populate          Override     protected OverlayItem createItemint i              return mOverlays.geti          Override     public int size              return mOverlays.size          Override     protected boolean onTapint index              final OverlayItem item  mOverlays.getindex                     ...

Negative 2999 pI tried making my own .obj loader, but it didnt go as smoothly as I had hoped, and there is probably other libraries out there that do it more efficiently than I could.p  pSo can anyone recommend a good library for loading 3d models Id prefer a 3ds loader because I want to eventually be able to use animation with them. If there is a different format out there that has a good loading library and also supports animation, that would be fine too.p  pOne thing that I need from it though is the ability to easily use the vertices, normals, and texture coordinates with Vertex Buffer Objects. I dont really want to have to write my own code to convert all the data to something I can send to a VBO, but I guess if I absolutely have to then I can.p

Negative 2999 pI want to add the menubar to TextBox control in Silverlight 4. I will create a new reusable control. The menubar will consists of a few image buttons. The idea is that it will normally stay hidden and will show up only when the user puts hisher mouse cursor to the TextBox area. If used in a multiline textbox, whole menubar can fit inside it, this should be easy. I hope. p  pBut how to solve situation when TextBox is in single line mode Id like to put the menubar above the TextBox. But I dont have a clue how to do it. Can somebody help I need to let all other controls in a form to stay in their positions, and only add my menubar above my textbox. So the menubar will NOT hide the textbox. Instead, it will hide other controls residing right above the textbox. It should work in all arrangements of form, like Grid, StackPanel, Canvas etc. In the fact it would be similar to a classic rightclick context menu, but not modal. Rightclick context menu is modal, i.e. while it is shown you cannot use other controls, and it automatically hides when you click anywhere else. I want my menubar to stay visible as long as user heeps mouse cursor over the textbox or the menubar.p  pExample Coordinates of textbox are top100,left20,bottom115,right120. So my menubars coordinates should be bottom100,left20, right amp top are based on size of menubar.p  pIf many textboxes will be used on a single page, each single one should have its own menubar.

Negative 2999 pI am writing a Tetrisbased game, and I am using a GridLayout to display the actual shaft which the Tetris pieces fall down. The GridLayout is filled with little JLabel objects. The shaft is itself a JPanel inside another JPanel, the panel I am using to contain and control the entire game. When the game ends, I want the words GAME OVER to appear on top of the grid, possibly accompanied by a small image. p  pMy shaft is an instance of ShaftPanel, which extends JPanel so that I could override paintComponent and is a nested private class so it has access to private instance variables of the larger JPanel. The private instance variable it needs to access is boolean game, which is true when the game is in session and set to false when the game is over. Here is the code for my ShaftPanel class p  precodepublic class ShaftPanel extends JPanel   public ShaftPanelGridLayout g   superg   public void paintComponentGraphics g   super.paintComponentg    ifgame     return    g.setColorColor.WHITE   g.setFontnew FontCourier New, Font.BOLD, 15   char[] c  G,A,M,E, ,O,V,E,R    g.drawCharsc,0,c.length,45,45  codepre  pp  pI have one method in the larger class calling the repaint method of shaft at the appropriate time. Adding a print statement indicates that the paintComponent method is being called when I want it to, and the setColor, setFont, drawChars methods are all being called at the correct times. However, nothing shows up. I highly suspect that the text is being drawn underneath the grid of JLabels, so that it cant be seen, but I dont know how to fix this problem. The JLabels inside the grid have to stay opaque, because the program relies on them being different colors. Is there a way to tell paintComponent to draw the text on top of anything else in the panel p

Negative 2999 pMy scenario I have a computation that should be run about once a second. After it is run there should be a wait of about 200ms for other stuff to catch up. If the compuation is still running after a second it should be started a second time, but should the program should wait until it is finished and start the next computation 200ms after finishing.p  pThe way I am doing it nowp  precoderefreshFinished  new Subjectltboolgt autoRefresher  Observable.IntervalTimeSpan.FromMilliseconds1000    .ZiprefreshFinished, x,y gt x    .Subscribex gt AutoRefreshstuff codepre  pThe problem with this code is, that i see no way to put in a delay after a computation finished.  The Delay method only delays the first element of the observable collection. Usually this behaviour is the right once, since you would have to buffer an endless amount of elements if you wanted to buffer everyone, but since delaying the call to Autorefesh by 200ms delays the output of refreshFinished by 200ms as well there would be no buffer overhead. Basicly I want an Observable that fires every every MaxTimesomecall,1000ms then gets delayed by 200ms or even better, some dynamic value. At this point i dont even really care about the values that are running through this, although that might change in the future.p  pIm open to any suggestionsp

I have many different varying queries, some where I join to the table over there, one with the subquery that, one using a group by here etc. etc.p  pOftentimes I need the result just to display a particular table that is generated by JSP, so I can just use the convenient queryForList method that returns a codeListltMapltString, Objectgtgtcode, a List with each row represented by a map that maps column names to values. In JSP this is just fine, there is no compile time type check anyway, no code completion for properties by eclipse etc.p  pBut sometimes I have java code to process the query result and I think it would be helpful to not work with maps, but with real objects, mainly for having a compile time check whether to properties really exist, have the correct type and of course to have code completion.p  pBut if I want that I need to write an Object for every single query which may be many objects pages of code with nothing but setters and getters.p  pWhat would be the best way to deal with that situation Just write those darn objects Or is there a better wayp

Currently the app requires photos to be categorized in several ways before they are valid, hence users must upload photos one at a time and categorize them in order to save them to the database.p  pCategorization takes some time, so Id like to allow users to upload batches of photos and then come back and categorize them when they have time, but when photos are stored without being fully categorized I dont want them mixed in with complete photos.p  pId ideally like this to be a sort of Wizard system where users can upload a bunch of photos at once and then proceed through their personal queue and categorize each photo to finish creating it when they have time.p  pMy question is how would you approach a problem like thisp  pIve been thinking about using Single Table Inheritance to create two subclasses of Photo codeIncompletePhotocode and codeCompletePhotocode.

Negative 2999 pSo I know you can use a semaphore and possibly other methods to determine if a lock will succeed andor how many threads are waiting for the lock but can you do this from within the lock itself p  pMy situation is I have an event handler that could be called by many objects within a codeListcode. I want to do a test within a lock to see if all the objects are in the right state before proceeding. The objects transition to the appropriate state strongand thenstrong raise this event so in a single thread model when the last one raises this event, all objects will be in the right state and we proceed. But it occurred to me that, with multiple threads, multiple objects may be transitioned to the state Im checking for but as yet have not processed this event as they are waiting at the lock. Therefore the conditional state check within the lock will be true but proceeding would be bad till all threads have finished processing this event. I need it to only be true as the last thread is processed to ensure we dont proceed too soon.p  pFor example in semi realistic codep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeobject LockObj  new object  void EventHandlerobject sender, EventArgs e      MyObject originator  sender as MyObject     iforiginator  null         return      Do stuff with the originator      lockLockObj              ifListOfMyObjects.FindAllo gt o.State  DesiredState                           .Count  ListOfMyObjects.Count                                   ampamp nothing waiting at the lock                      Proceed                codepre  pIm perfectly prepared to accept my approach is smelly to start with and that the solution Im looking for is moot if I do it properly in the first place but Im uncertain how to do it properly in a thread safe manner. p  pI was going to add yet more states to codeMyObjectcode and manage the flow by setting the appropriate State in the codeDo stuff with the originatorcode section but it didnt feel correct to be transitioning MyObject from here, not to mention I then have to implement a holding state for each state that raises an event which is getting smellier not simplerp  pSo if there is a simple way of doing the emnothing waiting at the lockem check then thats the way Id like to go unless Im missing a really simple to implement pattern that helps in this scenario.p

Negative 2999 pBefore starting on this project, I had the false impression I was proficient in coding and using Visual Studio 2010. I realize now I was under just full of myself.p  pMy platform is development box is 64bit Windows 7, but I need to build for both 64 and 32 bit platforms.

The .lib seems to compile, but obviously things are not all well since the test program breaks.p  pI cannot use .dlls with my program, this has come from on high, therefore Ive been trying to statically link my library to libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib.  Ive only just begun and like to start slow when using something new, so the only two functions Im trying to call from SSL are HMAC and EVPsha512p  pcodeHMACEVPsha512, key, keyLen, lpBufferAddr, dwCurBufSize, hashOut, amplencodep  pI acknowledge I may be doing it entirely wrong, but there you have it. Honestly, the only thing I need are the crypto functions, and HMAC functions. I could probably use something else, but Ive been told to use OpenSSL. Anyway, moving on....p  pWhen building the test program that links to my library project which in turn links to the two OpenSSL libraries, I get the following linking errorsp  precodeerror LINK2019 unresolved external symbol HMAC28 referenced in function public int thiscall etc error LINK2019 unresolved external symbol EVPsha51228 referenced in function public int thiscall etc codepre  pI include both libraries in Additional Dependencies, and have included their directory in Additional Library Dependencies.p  pCan anyone help me with this Ive been pouring over this and have come to the unfortunate conclusion Im a dunce.

Negative 2999 pIve read in some places that JavaScript strings are UTF16, and in other places theyre UCS2. I did some searching around to try to figure out the difference and found thisp  blockquote   pQ What is the difference between UCS2 and UTF16p      pA UCS2 is obsolete terminology which refers to a Unicode   implementation up to Unicode 1.1, before surrogate code points and   UTF16 were added to Version 2.0 of the standard. This term should now   be avoided.p      pUCS2 does not define a distinct data format, because UTF16 and UCS2   are identical for purposes of data exchange. Both are 16bit, and have   exactly the same code unit representation.p      pSometimes in the past an implementation has been labeled UCS2 to   indicate that it does not support supplementary characters and doesnt   interpret pairs of surrogate code points as characters. Such an   implementation would not handle processing of character properties,   code point boundaries, collation, etc. for supplementary characters.p blockquote  pvia a hrefhttpwww.unicode.orgfaqbasicq.html14httpwww.unicode.orgfaqbasicq.html14ap  pSo my question is, is it because the JavaScript string objects methods and indexes act on 16bit data values instead of characters what make some people consider it UCS2 And if so, would a JavaScript string object oriented around characters instead of 16bit data chunks be considered UTF16 Or is there something else Im missingp  pEdit As requested, here are some sources saying JavaScript strings are UCS2p  pa hrefhttpblog.mozilla.comnnethercote20110701fasterjavascriptparsinghttpblog.mozilla.comnnethercote20110701fasterjavascriptparsinga httpterenceyim.wordpress.comtagucs2p  pstrongEDITstrong For anyone who may come across this, be sure to check out this linkp  pa hrefhttpmathiasbynens.benotesjavascriptencodinghttpmathiasbynens.benotesjavascriptencodingap

Negative 2999 pLets assume we have one server with a database and N servers that can be used for caching data with Memcache. Every record in database can have several but substantially less than N representations in a cache. For example, entity with id 108 can be cached by keys entity1081, entity1082, ..., entity10810. When some record in a database changes, the respective records in cache are being replaced with a new data.p  pWhy is this architecture not better than masterslave database setup It seems like it has same advantages while additionally not suffering from replication lags.p

Ive also tried to change the whole ImageActionLink by a plain codeltimggtcode with a jQuery trigger with no difference.p  pWhat happens is that when a user clicks on the Edit link it will do an ajax call to the AddOrEditCriteria, that ActionResult, finds the criteria, and displays the PartialView form back into the div AddOrEditCriteriaFormContainer.  So far so good, this works fine in all browsers.p  pBut when I click a second time on that edit, instead of doing the ajax call, IE simply displays the PartialView from what it had in the cache, when all other browsers correctly pull the data again which is required, as that view allows to edit the criterias, it could have been edited by someone else in the mean time.p  pThe weird part is that IE is making the call but somehow it never reaches the server, it just uses the cache by using a Result 304.

Negative 2999 pCan you advise on how to represent parameterized data structures in haskell e.g. in an application which represents contents of a garments shop, I might have instances of racks for mens and womens clothes. These parameters can be hierarchical, e.g. based on age groups. So I can have a rackmenunder14, or a rackwomenadult. Also, some constraints may apply to the rack parameters, e.g. no baby clothes. And as with java classes, I would need some member functions which would operate on these instances.p

Negative 2999 pI was recently making some adjustments to code wherein I had to change a formal parameter in a function.  Originally, the parameter was similar to the following note, the structure was typedefd earlierp  precodestatic MySpecialStructure myspecialstructure static unsigned char charbeingpassed               Passed to function elsewhere. static MySpecialStructure  pmyspecialstructure   Passed to function elsewhere.  int myFunction MySpecialStructure  pstructure, unsigned char usefulchar      ...  codepre  pThe change was made because I could define and initialize myspecialstructure before compile time and myFunction never changed the value of it.  This led to the following changep  precodestatic const MySpecialStructure myspecialstructure static unsigned char charbeingpassed               Passed to function elsewhere. static MySpecialStructure  pmyspecialstructure   Passed to function elsewhere.  int myFunction const MySpecialStructure  pstructure, unsigned char usefulchar      ...  codepre  pI also noticed that when I ran Lint on my program that there were several Info 818s referencing a number of different functions.  The info stated that strongPointer parameter x line 253 could be declared as pointing to conststrong.p  pNow, I have two questions in regards to the above.  First, in regards to the above code, since neither the pointer nor the variables within MySpecialStructure is changed within the function, is it beneficial to declare the pointer as constant as well  e.g. p  precodeint myFunction const MySpecialStructure  const pstructure, unsigned char usefulchar codepre  pMy second question is in regards to the Lint information.  Are there any benefits or drawbacks to declaring pointers as a constant formal parameter if the function is not changing its value... even if what you are passing to the function is never declared as a constant  e.g. p  precodestatic unsigned char mychar static unsigned char  pmychar pmychar  ampmychar  int myFunction const unsigned char  pchar      ...  codepre  pThanks for your helpp  pstrongEdited for clarification strongp  pWhat are the advantages of declaring a strongpointer to codeconstcodestrong or a strongcodeconstcode pointer to codeconstcodestrong strongas a formal parameterstrong I know that I emcanem do it, but why would I want to... particularly in the case where the pointer being passed and the data it is pointing to are not declared constantp

Negative 2999 pI have the following issue I want to collect data from several locations or servers. Now I want to store all collected data locally at that location via carboncache, storageschemas and so on, but in addition to that I want to aggregate carbonaggregator this information to reduce network load and send it to another main or central location where all the important metrics from different locations are stored. The reason for this is, that internet connection to several locations is not always that reliable as some locations are in developing countries. Therefore a local backup with all the data would reduce the risk of losing important data. I thought of a setup where I use carbonrelay to duplicate the data. One goes into carboncache, the other one into carbonaggregator which forwards it to the main location. Is this even possible How would I achieve this configuration Or what would be another possibility to achieve my goal. I appreciate any help.p

Negative 2999 pI am trying to improve my knowledge of javascript and while searching for some best practices, someone pointed out to me that it is faster to cache the DOM document and then access it through that var instead of accessing the document object directly. p  pYou can see the results here, on an edit I made on jsperf a hrefhttpjsperf.comjquerydocumentcachedvsuncached3httpjsperf.comjquerydocumentcachedvsuncached3a edit the title holds jsquery because that was the original test, my edit contains vanilla javascript, the framework makes no differencep  pThis really makes me curious.

Negative 2999 pFirstly sorry if this is a common question but I couldnt  find anything on Google and it doesnt seem overly documented.p  pIm currently making a portfolio for myself showcasing my graphic design and things. I love how it looks but I do realise it looks quite dark in comparison to other websites. The text in the navigation bar especially is also quite small, but I dont want to change it.p  pInstead I would like to have a small iOS style switch at the bottom of the page which when clicked would take the user to an alternate version of the page in question, or just a version with different CSS applied to it. I could then set the backgrounds lighter, the text bigger, etc. The simple but tedious solution would be to make each page four times, one with big fonts and light backgrounds, one dark and small, etc. but this isnt ideal. I was wondering if I could make something more likep  precodeportfolio.co.ukhomelightonamptextbig codepre  pAs far as I know dynamic URLs as I believe theyre called are a PHP thing but I have as little experience with PHP as a man without experience of PHP. I was wondering if this task would be possible without getting too complex and if maybe thered be a way of even creating a cookie so that a recurring visitor wouldnt have to navigate to their preferred version every time.p  pThanksp

Negative 2999 pI have been through all the questions on S.O. of the Eclipse debugger cant find source variety, but still have no idea what is causing my problem. Basically I have 2 java projects in eclipse, project A and project B, and A is on Bs buildpath. A unit test in B instantiates a class ClassX that resides in A. When highlighting the ClassX constructor call in the unit test in B and pressing F3, eclipse does indeed open the ClassX source in A. However as soon as I try and step into this same call in the debugger, I get the source not found window.  If I click edit source Lookup path, Then I see that the default path already includes the src folder in project A, where the ClassX source resides. Furthermore if I click the source tab in the debug configuration used to debug the unit test in B, the default source lookup path there too contains the src folder in project A.p  pSo why cant the debugger find the ClassX sourcep  pAny suggestions would be much appreciatedp  pEDIT The default source path pictured below looks like its including project A org.xtext.example.hyrule  twice.

Negative 2999 pI have just started a new database project to price customer bid proposalsp  pSome of the tables in the database will contain information that is regularly updated say for example the pricing tables.p  pNow new bids should always use the latest information on the database, however existing bids should continue with the data used when they started unless the bid author decides otherwise.p  pMatters are somewhat simplified as a bid will under no circumstances use prices across versions so even if a product was coasted and available on an older version of the pricing table, it will not be available to newer projects.p  pIn order to achieve this I am planning to include a version column and perhaps a linked version control table. I think this will be enough.p  pHowever I feel like this must be a common database design requirement and thus there must be existing best practices and techniques to achieve this so Id rather build on existing experience than poorly reinvent the wheel.p  pAny advice on how to resolve this problem Also I am working with the Grails platform so any Grails specific information would be much appreciated.p  pIm not sure I explained my problem correctly so here is an examplep  precodeclass Bid   Each new customer bid is stored in this table     String bidName     static hasMany  [ item ItemList ]     static belongsTo  [ versionNumber VersionControl]   class ItemList   ProductsServices are associated with a bid via this table      String description     static belongsTo  [ bid Bid, item Price ]   class Price   The price of individual products and services the company offers     String description     Long value      static belongsTo  [ versionNumber VersionControl]   class VersionControl    So that when filling in the ItemList form for a bid, I can query for only     prices with the correct version number        String user     Long versionNumber     Date timestamp      static hasMany  [ bid Bid, productOrService Price ]  codepre  pThis example works fine, and illustrates what I want to do. I just dont know if it is the best way to address the problem and how well it will scale  I have around 20 tables containing different parameters whos versions I need to keep track of.p  pA bid will always be assigned the latest version of a pricing list, but the user must have the ability to be able to select a different version. p  pI should probably mention that prices will be updated in bulk, not individually, using a csv file provided by the accounting department. Each csv represents a new discreet price list version, not just as far as the database is concerned, but from an internal management perspective.p  pA similar philosophy will affect other tables in the DB such as exchange rates to use or geographical regions where the company operates.p  pThe regularity with which new versions are released is also hard to predict which could make determining the endDate a problem.p
Negative 2999 pI am developing a .NET 4.0 WPF application in C that controls a motor via RS232. I am having problems when exiting my application that the application sometimes deadlocks when closing the comport.p  pAfter some research on the internet I noticed this was a common problem and that using BeginInvoke in the DataReceivedEvent or closing the serialport in a different thread should solve the problem.  The problem with those workarounds are that. 1. I dont use the DataReceiveEvent. 2. closing the serialport in another thread doesnt make any difference. What happens is that the GUI shutsdown but you can see in the TaskManager that the process is still running.p  pOther things I have tried isp  ul liNot closing the serialport and just exiting the application. This successfully closes the application and process but the serialport is still blocked, and to unblock the serialport I need to restart the computer.li liSleeping a couple of seconds before and after I close the serialport.li liHaving the application be a WinForms app. instead of WPF. No difference in the deadlock between the two.li ul  pThe computer I run the program on uses com ports that are mounted on the motherboard and have Microsoft drivers.p  pAnd now for some codep  pWindowClosing event looks like thisp  precodeprivate void WindowClosingobject sender, System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs e      window.Closing  WindowClosing                 Thread CloseDown  new Threadnew ThreadStartserver.Dispose Closes serialport everything in another thread to avoid hang on serialport close.

Negative 2999 pstrongIs there a way to force the Android NDK to rebuild a particular library when changing build configurations in Eclipsestrongp  pI am building building an Android Project using the Android NDK to build C libraries. I am using Eclipse with the Sequoyah plugin. Everything is set up and works well.p  pHowever, I have run into an issue with build configurations. You can manage build configurations by rightclicking the projectproperties and then go to the CC Build section. This allows you to create the traditional Debug, and Release builds that most C libraries depend on in some way.p  pHere is an example of my Debug configurationp  precodeV1 NDKDEBUG1 NDKAPPLICATIONMKconfigdebugApplication.mk codepre  pThese work well, except that when I switch back and forth between configurations, it does not trigger a rebuild of the libraries I am building. This would be expected for something like Visual Studio where each build config dumps to a different directory, but in Eclipse everything gets dumped to the same directory. I am forced to actually change relevant source files to trigger a rebuild. So what ends up happening is I end up running for instance in the Debug configuration but linking to libraries that were built in Release.p  pSo my question is strongis there a way to force the NDK to rebuild a library when changing configurationsstrong I am aware of the B command I can add, but that rebuilds emeverythingem, emeverytimeem.

Note that this does not properly compare everything to everything you might get duplicate comparisons and some combinations might never be compared.p  pMy idea is to populate a combinations table with all the unique combinations between what is being compared amount of rows count Array elements choose 2  example 5 nCr 2. A and b are foreign keys to the score table holding the data for elos rating system.p  pIf an element disappears, the table can be cleaned and when a new element is added, a new set of permutations is added to the table.p  precodeid   a    b 1    1    2 2    1    3 3    1    4 4    1    5 5    2    3 codepre  pThe user would then be showed a randomly picked combination from the combinations table code[...] WHERE NOT id IN ids of combinations this user has already set a vote forcode. If theres nothing left, a message is shown that everything has already been compared to everything, come back after crontime.p  pUsers should be able to compare without registration. Plug and play. This is one of the first problems which arise. How to identify unique users Sessions could work but they can easily be renewed by the user. Ideasp  pThis implementation scales stronghorriblystrong. Both for each new user the processedcombinations, even though truncated daily, can go huge and the combinations table. Sure it works fine with comparing 1 to 5 with a few users, but what if we want to compare 1 to 100, or even thousandp  pWhat are your ideas for a better implementationp

Because I have a generic repository, it seemed a good and logic idea to have generic services. In the end, very similar to the repository structurep  precodeProjectNamespace BusinessLogicLayer.Services Service layer supposed to reference only the repository project and not Entity Framework.

How can I avoid the need to reference Entity Framework therep  pAt this point, Im willing to even throw it all out and rebuild everything but this is the only way I found to make it work given my needs DbContext sharing connection strings, generic repository to avoid replication of code.p  pAppreciate any help. Thanks.p  pemEditIncluding here some extra steps I did 3 hours after I posted the questionemp  pIn order to figure this out, I started to create a sample project with the same code above plus some implementation to mimic the results on the original project as much as possible.p  pI created the domain classes project, the whole base data layer project and then the context project. I noticed I need to reference Entity Framework on the context project even though the context class does not derive directly from DbContext. Instead, it derives from an abstract class that derives from DbContext. This is ok though since my context will have DbSets and any other implementation related to DbContext.p  pNext is the repository project. Needs to reference all other three domain, base data layer and context. My repository has no code. All funcionality lies on the ancestor. I try to compile the repository project and VS requires me to referente Entity Framework. I wonder if its really just a matter of embedding libraries. If this is confirmed, its going to be a surprise. Entity Framework library is present on the output of the other projects. Why would I need to reference it here too Whats making VS require thisp  pAnyway, for testing purposes, I added the reference. After all, Im inside the data layer. I can live with that. Moving on to the service layer. For the sake of simplicity, I put all of the service classes into the same project.p  pOne possible flaw is that one of the constraints for the service abstract classes is the repository interface. That requires me to add a reference to the base data layer on my service layer. Perhaps already here there is something I can do that allows me to use only the repository reference. I have no option but to reference base data layer.p  pLastly, my concrete service is created and VS gives me the following error message The type System.Data.Entity.DbContext is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly EntityFramework, Version4.3.1.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb77a5c561934e089.p  pSo, in the end, the only way to keep going is to reference Entity Framework on the service layer. And at some point, when building the Windows Forms App, I will also have to reference Entity Framework.p  pWhat should I do to avoid having these references What improvements can I have on this structurep  pWhat I know is that my app certainly doesnt have to know that Entity Framework is involved anywhere on the other layers. Neither does the service layer. Services will only consume repositories. Repositories can even be providing fake data for tests.p  pIn case anyone is interested, I uploaded the project I created while writing this. Its a 1,17Mb zip file with no binaries whatsoever except the Entity Framework 4.3.1 dll that I got through Nuget.

Negative 2999 pI have a simple winforms form used as a modal dialog with several controls on it. I want to display a tooltip for one of the textbox controls. I have added a tooltip component to my form, and did a SetToolTip call in the constructor of the form for the desired control. I am using default values for the various delay properties.p  pDisplay of the tooltip is very erratic. When the mouse is over the textbox, sometimes the tooltip displays. Sometimes it will only display when I move the cursor while over the control. Moving the cursor out and back in may get the tooltip to display. When it does display the timing seems much longer than InitialDelay. If it does work a few times, it then stops working, and no amount of leavingentering the control will make the tooltip appear again.p  pI tried setting ShowAlways to true, but that didnt make any difference. p  pAny suggestions for getting my tooltip to work reliablyp  pThanks.p
Negative 2999 pThis is a very strange issue. I have setup a web application that uses Active Directory authentication to authenticate users to the application. It does not use the ASP.NET Membership Provider. It works great  except for one user. They attempt to login and I have sat and watch them do this with their AD username and password and they get the following error message from the login controlp  blockquote   pYour login attempt was not successful. Please try again.p blockquote  pNow, I have seen elsewhere that this issue can be caused by not setting the applicationName in the web.config file a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20060422443634.aspx relnofollowwhen using the ASP.NET membership providera but I am NOT using the ASP.NET membership provider.p  pThey can log into all other AD applications without issue. Including ones that integrate via PHP and the native Windows login, etc., but not into this application. Helpp  pFurther Explanationp  pSecurity Roles which control permissions are baked into the application...so it isnt using AD permissions at all for determining access, it just ensures that the user is a valid AD user who can authenticate to AD, once it does this it uses the local application to determine security roles and provide valid permissions...but the user is getting a login error at the point where the app tries to authenticate to AD...even though they are entering correct info. and are able to access all other AD systems and we even did a password reset just to be safe.p

Negative 2999 pImagine you have a grid of sample points of a function z  fx, y where 1 lt x lt N and 1 lt y lt N. The formula is not given, but just the raw data, that could be for example the grey level of an image.p  pI would like to find, given a point A, whose x and y coordinates are given and z is known from the data, so A is a vertex of the surface a number M of points that lie on the circumference of the circle with center in  A and radius R that are a good approximation of a circular cloth draped on the imaginary surface described by the data points. Imagine also that the edges of the surface are a triangle mesh.p  pThe biggest constraint in the approximation is that the sum of the length of the edges of the resulting polygon is constantly R  2  PI, so that moving the A point across the surface would just change the M points but never the sum of their reciprocal distances. The draping doesnt need to be perfect, it would be nice though to be as close as possible to the surface., or always on one side of the surface, above or below.p  pCould anybody give me a pointer to something to read about this Is this a known problemp  pI feel that the problem is not completely formulated, Id already like some help to give a complete description of it.p

What I really dont understand is How would I do this with multiple filesp  pMy aproachp  ul liOne header per stateli liOne header with all possible states, forward declaredli lieach header which declares a state includes the header which declares its contextli ul  pThen it looks like thisp  precode forward.h struct Machine struct StA struct StB   machine.h include forward.h struct Machine  scstatemachinelt Machine, StA gt    a.h include forward.h  for StB include machine.h struct StA  scsimplestatelt StA, Machine, StB gt    b.h include forward.h include a.h struct StB  scsimplestatelt StB, StA gt  codepre  pNow its left open how to include the whole thing in the program. My idea was to have one header which includes from outside to inside all the states headers.p  precode themachine.h include forward.h include machine.h include a.h include b.h   use this header now where you need the state machine codepre  pHowever, I dont know if the general idea is ok and even if so, I cant get this to compile well, not emexactlyem this but a machine I built following this design principle.  Having all in one file it pretty easy once you reaized that context needs to be complete, states need to be forward declared and so on, but splitting for complexity and maintenance reasons frays my nerves ... codeIncomplete type StXY used in nested name specifiercode and so on.p

Negative 2999 pI feel like this might be answered in another OAuth question here, but I couldnt find it...p  pI have implemented an OAuth provider on a web service Im writing. OAuth consumers of my provider applications have consumer keys, and get user access tokens in the typical OAuth way get a request token, redirect to my producer to have the user authorize, get an access token, store that, etc. This all works fine.p  pMy question is about how these OAuth consumers can authenticate someone on visiting them using emmyem applications login credentials. Basically, when someone visits a consumer application, I would likep  ol liUser clicks login on consumer site.li liUser is redirected to my application and presented a login form.li liAfter login, my application OAuth provider, realizes that this user has already authorized this consumer, and redirects them back to the consumer.li liConsumer is somehow told this users username or access token in this request.li ol  pThis is similar to the typical OAuth flow, except that the OAuth consumer does not need to exchange an authorized request token for an access token. Instead, as soon as the user has authenticated, the consumer now knows which user was authenticated, and can immediately begin making requests using their alreadystored stored tokensecret.p  pWhat are some security conditions I need to take into account when implementing this Is this even possible to implement securely Navely, this could be implemented by having the producer return some GET parameter to the consumer callback, with the users username or something else unique. However, an attacker could exploit this by making requests to the consumers callback with the username of the user they want to attack.p  pThoughts Is this a solved problem that Im trying to reinvent and reimplement My platform is Java, if there are libraries that already do all of this. Thank youp

I did this after seeing Jersey popping up with Guice often on Google, thinking there would be sufficient documentation to get the two of them working together.

It appears to be for a different more specialized functionality of RESTful services than regular servlets  but thats what I needed, anyway.  From my unscientific Googling observations besides Tomcat theres Grizzly and Jetty that are popular as well  you may want to look into them if youre having trouble with Tomcat.p  pI hope this edit saves someone the hours I spent yesterday and today getting it to work.p

Negative 2999 pIm trying to implement a form using the jQuery Form plugin. The form has three text fields and a file input and I am validating the form in the beforeSend callback. The problem is, whether the validation passes or not, the php script that handles the file upload gets loaded in the browser, which, obviously is not what I want to happen  I need to stay on the forms page.p  pYou can take a look at the form and its dependent files at a hrefhttpwww.eventidewebdesign.compublictestUpload relnofollowhttpwww.eventidewebdesign.compublictestUploada. Indexing is on for that directory, so you can take a look at all of the related files. The form itself is on testUpload.php.p  pId appreciate it if someone could take a look at my code and help me figure out whats going on here.p

Negative 2999 pthis is just a question out of curiousity. Lets say, I have an application where some objects are created dynamically during runtime.

And as a last precondition we say, that it is totally important to optimize the performance.p  pWhat would be the betterperforming alternativep  ol lipFirst create an array[20]. When adding objects, perform a check whether the array is already totally occupied, and if so create a new array with newArray[array.length  f], where f is a float greater than 1.0f.

Negative 2999 pEDIT PLEASE NOTE The thing I ask for is impossible, as explained at the bottom Therefore, the question is answered.p  pDear people with overflowing stacks,p  pI have a problem with a syntax error in a prepared statement in a stored procedure. I get a syntax error when I run the procedure, but not if I manually execute the syntax returned by the SELECT sql command. It has to do with the delimiter, because if I have only one command, it runs fine within the procedure. I did not use any table within my procedure for easier reproductionp  precodeDROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS stackoverflowtest DELIMITER   CREATE PROCEDURE stackoverflowtest  BEGIN        SET sql  CONCAT         SELECT test12 AS test1         SELECT test34 AS test2           return the statement from sql     SELECT sql      execute the statement from sql     PREPARE stmt FROM sql     EXECUTE stmt     DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt  END DELIMITER   CALL stackoverflowtest  codepre  pI tried to look for this, but all hits are about the general use of the DELIMITER command when defining a procedure. Now I know that the delimiter works clientside. Do I have to use something else in a statement that is saved on the server EDIT I did try to use  as a delimiter, which produced the same syntax error.p  pBest chonezp  pEDIT It seems to be impossible. SQL syntax for prepared statements does not support multistatements Source a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1ensqlsyntaxpreparedstatements.html relnofollowhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1ensqlsyntaxpreparedstatements.htmla . The solution for me was to reduce the prepared statement to one statement and move the other statements around the execution, which worked for me because the other statements are staticp  precodefirst static statement DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table  dynamic statement PREPARE stmt FROM sql EXECUTE stmt DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt  second static statement ALTER TABLE table     ADD UNIQUE INDEX sdef  cntry, track, year  codepre
Negative 2999 pRecently Ive been working on an expression engine project that has a performance problem. On a test with 50 concurrent connectionsp  ol liExtremely high 100 CPU usageli liLow RAM usage 2 gigs out of 8li liLow CPURAM usage on the databaseli ol  pAnd the web server has 4 CPUs. Now, if I turn on the cache, the utilization is lower, but the content is such that dynamic caching had to be taken off. Now the expression engine is made up of templates that have to be read into memory and parsed. For those not familiar with expression engine, it is built using CodeIgniter.p  pMy thinking is this that if Apache and the expression engine files were taken off HDD and put onto an SSD, IO for the templates, it would be a lot faster and would lower the CPU utilization by Apache. Would this kind of performance improvement actually happen or would an SSD make no differencep

Negative 2999 pIm currently working on a project that primarily uses Jython, but makes use of interop using rik0s a hrefhttpsgithub.comrik0pyclj relnofollowpyclja solution with Clojure to utilize the a hrefhttpovertone.github.com relnofollowOvertonea library. Typically, leiningen is the primary way of handling dependencies for projects, but since Im mostly using Jython, I doubt it will help with handling the dependencies when using it.

I assume this means that either just having the jar on the classpath isnt sufficient for including resources packaged in the jar like dylibs, or that its something to do with the fact that the Jython files arent compiled and resolved in the lein build.p  pHow would I go about properly resolving these resource dependencies between Jython and Clojurep  pEDITp  pSo I was able to get it to work using a hacky solution found from a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumfromgroupstopicovertonevhfd1eH5pL0 relnofollowthisa Google Groups post by setting the dynamic library path to the path where libscsynth.dylib is located before running Jython.

Negative 2999 pI am building a windows store application in vs2013 preview with the Hub App Template.

Everything works fine until I go to local machine and then it shows a clipped version of the 100 scale image. It should be scaling to the 180. It is also clipping the area of the hub section to only show about 40 of the width the hero image should be. p  pIs there anyway to change how the scaling works so that it is pulling the correct 180 scale I assume it thinks I am on a TV set and not a monitor because the Device section for 23 and 27 show only a scale of 100 and they are close to the results I am seeing in my local machine build. p  pEditing to provide more information.p  precode    ltHubSection Width1024gt         ltHubSection.Backgroundgt             ltImageBrush ImageSourceAssetsCavePainting.png StretchUniformToFillgt         ltHubSection.Backgroundgt     ltHubSectiongt codepre  pImages are titledp  precodeCavePainting.scale80.png CavePainting.scale100.png CavePainting.scale140.png CavePainting.scale180.png codepre  pThe images scale properly as long as I am in simulator mode, but once I go into Local Machine they do not, they scale back to 100 and there is a lot of clipping.

Negative 2999 pI am currently working on an Object Oriented Design project, and would like to know if there is a better way to validate data in mutators of subclasses.p  pFor example, I have a Home class with the subclasses Apartment, Condo, and House. In the Home class, I would like to include the mutators for private fields that the subclasses share. Say one of the fields is squareFootage. Is there a way to make the mutator in Home generic enough so that the subclasses can then set their own valid values for squareFootage without having to override the mutator completely That is, I want different valid ranges for squareFootage for each subclass.p  pIve tried setting possible range values in Home, then override them in the subclasses. Unfortunately, the mutator in Home still grabs from the Home class and not the subclass.p  pSo, Ive resorted to abstracting the mutators, but unfortunately this results in a lot of repeated code, since I can literally copy and paste the mutators in each subclass.p  pI want to make the possible range values static if possible, and I understand this may be possible with reflection, but Id really like to avoid using it for this project.p

Negative 2999 pI have problem with simple javascript and some ajax.p  pI have link that calls javascript function like this p  precodeltdiv idButton11 onmouseoverchangeContent4gtActionsltdivgt codepre  pJavascript function that is called above is like this p  precodefunction changeContent4      BubbleOn     document.getElementByIdtext1.innerHTMLSome text here     clearTimeoutBOffi     var BOffi  setTimeoutBubbleOff, 20000  codepre  pThis works, it runs BubbleOn function, places text to element text1, most likely it empties BOffi timeout and sets new timeout 20000ms for it.p  pHere is BubbleOnp  precodefunction BubbleOn   bubble.fadeInfunction        codepre  pAnd here is BubbleOffp  precodefunction BubbleOff   bubble.fadeOutfunction        codepre  pAs in functions BubbleOn and BubbleOff works. They just hide or show div named bubble which contains text1 element. When BOffi goes timeout it just runs the BubbleOff function. This works fine. The problem is that when BubbleOff has been run and mouse is placed immediately over link that runs changeContent4, It does make the bubble div visible again and places text there again but then bubble div fades out inside a second Not after 20000ms. After this if the mouse is placed again to run changeContent4 everything works great. If there is about millisecond longer time than a second between the bubble fadeout and placing the mouse over changeContent4 launcher it works and waits 20000ms. Less than a second and bubble is shown about second...p  pWhat can cause this Could it be that fadeOut is still running even the bubble is vanished from the screen and therefore it does not reset the BOffi counter Which could have 1 second or less time left and then runs BubbleOff again after that magical secondp

Negative 2999 pSay you have a set of objects that are arranged into a hierarchy. That is, there is an all encompassing object, then that object refers to several objects of the same kind but at a lower level, and each of those objects refer to several objects of the same kind but of a lower level, and so on for a variable number of steps. For example sake, lets consider these objects to be governments, so the highest level would be global, then global would have countries, and tribes, and countries would have towns, and towns would have houses, and businesses ect. All these governments extend the gov abstract class, so they all share the same kind.p  pI need to iterate through all the objects in the whole hierarchy, but because I dont know the complete structure at runtime, I have to do it in a generalized fashion.I only know for certain that there is a Global government, and then I have to check what subgovernments it has to proceed.p  pOne way Iv found to do it is to give the super class a function called getSubGovs which returns a list of all its sub governments plus what each of those sub governments return from getSubGovs. I hope that makes sense. Its a nice way to recurs through the problem. p  pWhat Im looking for is a way to do this without having to add a function to the super class, for the case where Im dealing with an API and cannot modify the super class. What would be an elegant way to do thatp

Negative 2999 pThe background for this question centres on a grid demonstrating progress in tasks on work items. Each row represents a work item that follows a set pattern of steps, some of which are performed per work item, or are performed on all work items at the same time.p  pThe brief is that a checkbox be provided in the header for each step that is performed on all work items simultaneously, and when this checkbox is checked, all the checkboxes in that column are checked.p  pFurthermore and I understand this might be a separate question, but I am including this since it is part of the same issue I am experiencing, whenever a checkbox in a row is checked, all the previous checkboxes in that row are also checked. It also stands that any checkboxes after a particular checkbox are unchecked if they are inadvertently checked, but I assume this would be a minor addition to the select code for a row cell checkbox.p  pMy understanding is to have an on click event in the column header checkbox triggering a function that iterates through rows and selectsdeselects checkboxes in that column. These checkboxes in turn would have onclick and onchangesince the checkbox isnt actually being clicked events that select all the checkboxes prior to that checkbox and deselect those checkboxes further along the row.p  pSee below for example code rendering the table and some pseudocode the example is using static data as a proof of concept to the client, but will eventually interact with a SQL DB.

Negative 2999 pI have a bit of a theoretical question for which there is no code yet as I am still just in the thinking stage. I want to update an app to allow users to share their data with others through DropBox Datastore or something like that. However, when a user creates data which get populated into multiple sqlite tables on the device, each table has an autoincremental integer as a primary key that is used as a foreign key in other tables to link the data.p  pIf there is more than one user actually creating the data and sharing it then the primary key columns are obviously going to be an issue. If I download the data and store it locally I obviously cant insert user 1s key value in user 2s data table, firstly because of the autoincrement and secondly because user 2 might already have data that is not shared saved with that key value.p  pI have thought about a few options but nothing is particularly appealing or robust. I was thinking about creating a UUID to identify the device, that value would have to be stored in each of the tables and the primary key would be a combination of that column and the current primary key integer which would obviously have to have the autoincrement removed. So to pick up all related data from each table the id column and UUID column would both have to be used.p  pI feel like there must be a more robust method of achieving this though, any one have any better suggestionsp

Negative 2999 pIs there a compelling reason why codegnometerminalcode and, under the hood, maybe the codeVTEcode widget sets codeTERMcode to codextermcode rather than codexterm256colorcode  Clearly it supports 256 colors.  p  pFor a while, I had a line in my code.bashrccodecode.zshrccode to simply codeexport TERMxterm256colorcode, because thats usually the terminal emulator that Im using.  But then I open up codetmuxcode, and the behavior  colors are wrong in many CLI applications, such as codeemacscode and codehtopcode, because codetmuxcode will set the codeTERMcode variable to screen256color, emthenem the shell loads and executes my code.rccode file, which then sets the codeTERMcode incorrectly.p  pFor now, I havep  precodeif [ TERM  screen256color ] then     export TERMxterm256color fi codepre  pI dont like this, because what if one day I break out my actual VT220 or use a different terminal emulatorp

Negative 2999 pI have gone through some materials available on the web regarding the unix file system but I couldnt get any proper answer.In some materials it is mentioned that the directory structure used in unix file system has a hierarchical directory structure whereas in some others it has been mentioned that actually its a directed acyclic graph due to the presence of hard links.It is obviously hierarchical but DAG will be a better term to describe it.Can anyone explain whether it is really a DAG or hierarchical or tree structured p
Negative 2999 pLast night a friend and I came across an anomaly that were trying to understand, but cant. At the time we were playing with an ATTiny2313 using AVR assembly, today I have replicated the exact same experience in Arduino on the ATMega328P. p  pI noticed he had an error in his code where he was setting a LED HIGH and later LOW using codePINB,6code. I told him to use codePORTB,6code and for some other reason that didnt work at all. That whole code is gone now, so I have replicated it in Ardunio C and got unexpected results being that when assigned correctly everything works as it should, yet when assigned incorrectly, the LED flashes at half the rate. It seems like a phasing issue.p  pBefore I go into the code, I KNOW you can not assign output via codePINcode, the issue is we tried in error and were trying to understand how it works. p  precodevoid setup   DDRB0xFF   void loop   PORTB  1ltlt5     turns on the LED   delay500   PORTB amp 1ltlt5  turns off the LED   delay500    codepre  pThe above code is correct and the led toggles every 500ms p  precodevoid setup   DDRB0xFF   void loop   PINB  1ltlt5     turns on the LED   delay500   PINB amp 1ltlt5  turns off the LED   delay500    codepre  pNow the above code does in fact occasionally work. Instead of turning on and off every 500ms, it turns on and off every second p  pI have inspected the circuit diagram for the chip actually the ATMEga128as I have a hard copy of the PDF here, pp66, Figure 30, General Digital IO.p  pThe circuit indicates PINx is read only, but you obviously can set it, although it seems to take every third set. p  pAs an interesting aside, if you only SET PINx as in the following codep  precodevoid loop   PINB  1ltlt5     turns on the LED   delay500  codepre  pthe LED TOGGLES every 500ms. Trying the same with clearing the OUTPUT doesnt work, only setting it.p  pAgain, I KNOW this isnt how the OUTPUT is set, Im just trying to understand why it does what it does.p

Negative 2999 pSo I have a List of job names in a codeListViewcode that is generated by a custom adapter that extends codeBaseAdaptercode. All items are shown as grayed out initially. For each item, I send an async request through a web service in order to get the status of this job. At the same time, I show an indefinite progress bar in each row. Everytime a response is received, a callback method onSuccessint itemPosition gets called for that particular item. itemPosition is the index of the item in the List.

Negative 2999 pI have a dbf table. I want to automatically divide this table into two or more tables by using Python. The main problem is, that this table consists of more groups of lines. Each group of lines is divided from the previous group by empty line. So i need to save each of groups to a new dbf table. I think that this problem could be solved by using some function from Arcpy package and FOR cycle and WHILE, but my brain cant solve it D  My source dbf table is more complex, but i attach a simple example for better understanding.

Negative 2999 pmy app has two functions, validate the input the user enter. one EditText must be numbers only, one must be alphabet only.no space or special characters. i have done the numbers, but i search there are no alphabetonly validation. so can someone teach me how to loop through EditText and ensure every character is a alphabet  strongEDITstrong i change my code in my afterTextChanged.when i press a alphabet or number in my userTextInout, my app crashed second is to calculate the steps user has taken or just distance by using gps. however my output has nothing. it display nothing. Im not sure whether it has something to do with the emulator. in my past application, when i click on the emulator control to send gps data, it will not send most of the time, after i click repeatedly on the send button then it can update my location. p  pi heard there is a new Location API for more accuracy but what is the difference between that and mine at the Google developer page there are not much detail.p  peven if i calculated the distance, how do i display it the setText does not display long. it is my first time using distanceBetween method so i am not familar with it. p  pXML codep

Negative 2999 pI have a Symfony project which also sends some standard emails like Dear user XYZ, please find the attached file etc.  the content of these emails is stored in Twigtemplates like yourfile.html.twig. The admin has the ability to change those basically textfiles in a simple webinterface. Any changes are written back to the file. The emails are send with SwiftMailer just like in the example code in their docs with the filepath to the twig template.p  pThis works fine in the debug environment  as Twig automatically rerenders cached files which were changed. However, when I am in production environment this doesnt work anymore. Changes made to the mail template arent recognised by Twig and it uses the cached version and the user therefore gets an email with the text of the old version.p  pOne way to solve this problem would be to just clear the cache every time the admin changed the email templates which wont happen too often. Anyway, I dont like this way as it forces a full rerender of every page which is just a waste of resources...p  pAnother possibility would be to enable the auto rerender feature of Twig also in production environment, but again Im not happy with this solution as it results in performance loses...p  pThe best way of doing this would be to call some function to rerender just this one file which was changed Pseudo code twigrerenderpathtofileyourfile.html.twig, but I could not find any way to accomplish this. Maybe I just used the wrong keywords for searchingp  pI would really appreciate if someone has an idea on how to solve the problem abovep  pThanks in advance, katzesonnep

Negative 2999 pIm using codeLaravelcode and am attempting to write an artisan command that accepts an argument, content, that then needs to be transposed to an array. For examplep  precode     An example of a value that is being passed in from the CLI and stored as content     content  [div][div][0][h2][a] codepre  pTo clarify, codecontentcode is then being passed in as a function argument where it will be used to pull out the values from the actual result set. In other words, Im receiving a response from an API and codecontentcode is the path to the values that I need to pull out of the response. For example, the hard coded version of the implementation looks likep  precode    result  report[div][div][0][h2][a] codepre  pNow, coderesultcode contains the values that I need to process. However, Im trying to make this dynamic so I dont repeat myself each time I add in a new data source to check for reports. Currently, I have 4 functions each with hardcoded paths to the desired result the goal is to make it so that I can pass in an argument that contains the path to the desired values and refactor my code so I only have the one function which accepts the path to the values as an argument.p  pI hope that clarifies the endgoal and why Im only referencing keys, not a value.p  pAnyway, back to the problem at hand. Ive attempted different variations of the followingp  precode     Attempting to parse the string into an array     arr  explode], trimstrreplace[,,content, ] codepre  pThis results in the following arrayp  precode    array size5       0 gt string div length5       1 gt string div length5       2 gt string 0 length1       3 gt string h2 length4       4 gt string a length3 codepre  pBut, what I need is for the array to be formatted like the followingp  precode    array  [div][div][0][h2][a] codepre  pI attempted to do a codeforeacharray as elementcode over codearrcode and do an codearraypushcode for each element, but that resulted in the same output as codearrcode. p  pHow can I loop over the string and parse it into an array Additionally, I need 0 to remain as an index, and not be type casted as a string. And, one last note, the value of codecontentcode will be completely different each time, so I need it to be quite flexible. The only part that will remain constant is the code[code and code]code will always encapsulate the keys.p  pId love to hear how others would solve this seemingly trivial problem Ive taken a few years off from programming and apparently have forgotten more than I care to admit   . I honestly thought that the strreplace and explode was going to provide me the result I was expecting... p  pBut, after rereading the php.netexplode doc, its always going to cast each element as a string thus overriding my 0 index, and I have no idea how to turn it into a nested array, instead of a simple, flat array.p  pI look forward to your advice and insight. Thanks.p  pEDITp  pIncluding the function that is making use of the arguments to help provide some greater clarity.p  precodeprivate function yqlcheckwebsiteurl, xpath, content       requireonce..vendorOAuth.php      statement  select  from html where urlurl and xpathxpath       cckey   thisgtkey     ccsecret  thisgtsecret     url  httpquery.yahooapis.comv1publicyql     args  array     args[q]  statement     args[format]  json      consumer  new OAuthConsumercckey, ccsecret     request  OAuthRequestfromconsumerandtokenconsumer, NULL,GET, url, args     requestgtsignrequestnew OAuthSignatureMethodHMACSHA1, consumer, NULL     url   sprintfss, url, OAuthUtilbuildhttpqueryargs     url . ampenvstoredatatables.orgalltableswithkeys     ch  curlinit     headers  arrayrequestgttoheader     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTHTTPHEADER, headers     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, url     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, TRUE     rsp  curlexecch     report  jsondecodersp, true       Dynamically inspect the report object for the xpath content     result  report . content      unsetreport      return result  codepre  pSo, report contains the entire API response, but the only thing I need is the content that is provided in codereport[div][div][0][h2][a]code for this example, at least, the path is different for each report that Im scraping. So, the reason Im trying to convert the command line argument into an array is so that it can be used in the above code where codecontentcode is being called in order to navigate the APIs response and return the values from that segment. p  pI hope that makes more sense. And, if there is a better way to achieve this endgoal, feel free to mention it. I may be taking the wrong approach...p

So in Step you would writep  precodeStep     function firstStepNoArgs          foo.asyncCallthis     ,     function secondSteperr, argFromFoo          if err              handleErrorerr                   bar.asyncCallargFromFoo, 1, this.parallel         baz.asyncCallargFromFoo, 2, this.parallel     ,     function thirdSteperr, argFromBar, argFromBaz          if err              handleErrorerr                    etc...        codepre  pIf I didnt know any better, I might guess youd do that in async.js like this emuntested, consider it pseudocode Im talking about a theoretical change I havent actually pursued yetemp  precodefunction thirdStepargFromBar, argFromBaz       etc...    async.waterfall[     function firstStepNoArgscallback          foo.asyncCallcallback     ,     function secondStepargFromFoo, callback          async.parallel[             barResult functioncallback                  bar.asyncCallparameterFromFoo, 1, callback             ,             bazResult functioncallback                  baz.asyncCallparameterFromFoo, 2, callback                      ],             functionerr, result                  if err                      handleErrorerr                  else                      thirdStepresult.barResult, result.bazResult                                    ],    functionerr, result         if err             handleErrorerr         else              noop just assume thirdstep runs               codepre  pStep was very focused and sequential, and my little draft here shows it getting messy in the adaptation.  Am I missing somethingp  pstrongSo my question isstrong What is the right way to convert the clear Step code into Async.JS  Or have I chosen the wrong library to upgrade to  I dont want my code to get uglier, but I dont want to depend on a library that seems kind of dead, either.  p
Negative 2999 pIve decided to roll my own FTP Socket client in C in order to have more control but mostly for the learning experience.  But I cannot figure out how much file data I need to read after issuing the RETR command.  I am able to establish the initial FTP communication connection, and then connect a second socket on a new port by issuing the PASV command and all that good stuff.p  pMy problem is, when I issue the RETR command on the Communication port, the FTP server begins sending the file over the Passive port and then issues the 226 command when it finishes sending on the Communication port.  I can receive the data fine but sometimes the 226 command arrives on the Communication port before all of the file data arrives on the Passive port.  So, if I immediately signal my Passive socket task to stop reading after I get the 226 command, it will sometimes miss out on the data that comprises the end of the file.  Ive tried checking for Socket.Available before exiting out of my Socket.Receive loop but more often than not Socket.Available will report 0 bytes available on the socket  but with sockets that doesnt mean there isnt more data on the way.  Reading the FTP spec it seems as though the FTP server is supposed to shut down the data connection after it finishes sending all the data but I dont think that is happening.  I can keep looping reading 0 bytes of data all day long.  Am I looking at a broken FTP server or am I doing something wrong in my methodologyp  pNow for some additional info that might be the answer to my question. Using Filezilla, connected to the same FTP server, I see that when requesting a file the FTP server appends the file length to the 150 command in parenthesis. For example, 150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for test.zip 123421 bytes.  Is this text part of the FTP standard  If all FTP servers use this same behavior and formatting then I can just keep reading until I hit 123,421 bytes.  But if this isnt common behavior then Im back at square one.  Appreciate any ideas.p

Negative 2999 pIm fairly new to WPF and am almost positive Ive just overlooked something.  Im having issues preserving the state of user controls within my tabs when I select.  It seems very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2080764howtopreservecontrolstatewithintabitemsinatabcontrolthis questiona but it didnt seem to get resolved.p  pIn my main ViewModel I have an ObservableCollection of the abstract TabableViewModel class.  It also implements the INotifyPropertyChanged for the TabControls SelectedIndex.  p  pI want the TabControls content to be automatically created so I used a DataTemplate like sop  precodeltWindow.Resourcesgt      ltDataTemplate DataTypexType vmEasyViewModelgt         ltUserControlsEasyControlgt     ltDataTemplategt     ltDataTemplate DataTypexType vmComplicatedViewModelgt         ltUserControlsComplicatedControlgt     ltDataTemplategt     ltDataTemplate xKeyTabHeaderTemplategt         ltGridgt             ltTextBlock TextBinding HeaderText gt         ltGridgt     ltDataTemplategt     ltStyle xKeyTabItemStyle TargetTypeTabItemgt         ltSetter PropertyHeader ValueBinding gt         ltSetter PropertyHeaderTemplate ValueStaticResource TabHeaderTemplate gt         ltSetter PropertyContent ValueBinding gt     ltStylegt ltWindow.Resourcesgt ltTabControl xNamecontentTab TabStripPlacementBottom        SelectedIndexBinding SelectedTabIndex, ModeTwoWay       ItemsSourceBinding TabItems, ModeTwoWay        ItemContainerStyleStaticResource TabItemStylegt ltTabControlgt codepre  pEasyControl and ComplicatedControl both have a number of text boxes, combo boxes and other fields. Both ViewModels extend the TabableViewModel class and implement INotifyPropertyChanged.p  pIn a typical test the ObservableCollection will contain one instance of EasyViewModel and then two instances of ComplicatedViewModel.  The tabs build themselves properly, but the state of the ViewModels is not being maintained.p  pIf I make changes inside EasyControl, switch to the first ComplicatedControl tab and then switch back, all data has been lost.p  pIf I make changes to the first ComplicatedControl and switch to the second, I get those same changes instead of a blank slate.  If I then switch to EasyControl and back again, all data is once again cleared.p  pIve seen quite a few examples where the DataTemplates are basic, but I havent seen any where UserControls are picked based on ViewModel type.  Is there anything special I have to do to maintain statep  pI dont want to break the MVVM pattern by creating the UIElements within the ViewModels.  Im also hoping that I dont have to extend any Tab controls to get this working, but I will if I have to.  Im surprised its this hard to do.p

Negative 2999 pIm using ARC. I have UINavigationController to push and pop. It happens that one of the ViewController is a huge scrollview holding up 100MB. After popViewController, the ViewController that contains the scrollview is supposed to release. NSLog shows that dealloc was called. However, the 100MB memory is still occupied. Is it normal p  pIf dealloc of the viewController get called, does it mean that its retainCount is already Zero and Im not leaking the viewController p  pThanks in advancep  pRef a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9226023memorynotreleasedwhenpopviewcontrollercalledMemory not released when popViewController Calleda APURV is suggesting there is a cache mechanism of iOS that holds up memory.  Is that true p  pEDIT  Memory usage was observed from Debug Navigator in Xcode img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvpGrY.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT2 p  pI just tried running exactly the same code again. But this time, I have Personal Hotspot of my iPhone ON and have it downloading something continuously. I then run the app again with the same code. I see this  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comU3gwl.png altenter image description herep  pThe spike in the middle is the 100MB scrollview, now if I popViewController, it goes back to 12MB. It makes me think that theres really a cache going on in iOS and is depending on memory availability. When its out of memory, the cache will be washed away, also, release will then happen immediately. p  pI will also try to learn to Instrument and post result here later. p

And the distance should depend on when the button is clicked. p  pHeres what I have gotten so far. p  precode RequestAnimFrame a browser API for getting smooth animations window.requestAnimFrame  function      return window.requestAnimationFrame              window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame           window.mozRequestAnimationFrame              window.oRequestAnimationFrame                window.msRequestAnimationFrame                function callback               return window.setTimeoutcallback, 1000  60            var loop  400 var canvas  document.getElementByIdmyCanvas var context  canvas.getContext2d  function drawALine      context.beginPath     context.moveTo10, 10     context.lineTo400, 10     context.stroke   function drawABallpositionX      context.beginPath     context.arcpositionX, 10, 5, 0, 2  Math.PI, false     context.fillStyle  green     context.fill     context.lineWidth  5     context.strokeStyle  003300     context.stroke   function clearScreen      context.clearRect0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height   function animloop      loop  loop  1     init  requestAnimFrameanimloop      clearScreen     drawALine     drawABallloop   jQueryaddBall.clickfunction      animloop     drawABall0  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnoppanitz5VwL6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netnoppanitz5VwL6ap
Negative 2999 pSay I have a table with integer columns codenoofunitscode and codeaveragerevenueperunitcode. To get the total revenue for any one row, I just need to calculate codenoofunits  averagerevenueperunitcode  simple enough. But what if I want to calculate the total revenue for the entire tablep  pThe obvious way would bep  precodetotalnoofunits  TableName.sumunits overallaveragerevenue  TableName.averagerevenueperunit totalrevenue  totalnoofunits  overallaveragerevenue codepre  pBut it feels icky having to use two separate SQL queries. Is there a way I can do this with just one chained ActiveRecord query Or could I and should I do it using raw SQLp  pEDIT Ive just realised my above sample code is wrong codeoverallaveragerevenuecode is the average of all the integers in the coderevenueperunitcode column... but this isnt the same thing as the actual average revenue per unit, because different rows have different numbers of units. I need a weighted average. Back to the drawing board...p
Negative 2999 pI am using Python 2.7.5 on my Linux Mint to write simple programs as .py files and running them in Konsole Terminal. These work fine on my computer, but I need to share them with a friend using Windows IDLE I suppose and wonder if these will work as they are without modification.p  pThe programs start with the usual codeusrbinpythoncode, you know. p

Negative 2999 pI have a simple Google App Engine backend written in Python for an Android client. All the backend is responsible for is accepting a key and returning a value it is a classifier in general, implemented simply by looking up the key in a Cloud SQL table, though this specific behavior will change in the future.p  pThe backend and client communicate via Google Cloud Endpoints. I want to restrict access to my backends API to only accept requests incoming from my client, and am wondering if OAuth 2.0 is really the way to do this. p  pI dont need any contextual or extra information from the user, and as such, dont want to have user action to grant any type of authorization. All I need to do is be certain the request came from my app. I was considering simply generating a static key and hardcoding it in my client and backend, but I thought there must be a more elegant way to do this.p  pTLDR How can I restrict access to my backend only to my clientapp without needing user contextinput, by OAuth 2.0 or otherwisep

Negative 2999 pHey  So I was able to figure out most of the issue so far. I m trying to draw a button by resizing a simple button background image to fit the size of the text. Everything works well except for the actual drawing of the string. The strongystrong value that I give the Graphics object designates the baseline, however I would like to draw the the string above the y. So that this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comltVo4.png altcutoff string doesnt happen. I gave the graphics object the y of the bottom of the strongPstrong and would instead like to give it the value of the bottom of the strongystrong. Is there a way to do that by reading the Strings bounds or something, or is there a way to get the Graphics object to use the passed strongystrong value as the definite bottom of the Stringp  pThanks, StrongJoshuap

But Im having trouble correctly importing the library.p  pThis is the URL of the library  a hrefhttpsgithub.comdmytrodanylykandroidprocessbutton relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdmytrodanylykandroidprocessbuttonap  pI first tried importing the library to eclipse and move the files in java directory to src directory and set the project as library and importing the sample to eclipse and set it to use the library project PropertiesAndroidLibraries. But it didnt work. The layout files said it failed to instantiate [custom widget class]. p  pThe I tried importing the .jar file to libs directory and update the java build path but it didnt work either. It showed errors in the java files too.p  pI then tried copying all the java and layout files to the sample project directory and it worked. But Im guessing thats not the way to work with 3rd party libraries.p  pI first thought its some error with the library but all the other libraries I tried to import to my projects faced the same problem.p  pCan someone walk me through how to correctly import a 3rd party library to my android projectp

I believe I know the answer but Ive received contradicting answers, so I figured Id ask here.p  pOn the W3C site it saysp  blockquote   pstrongClient Error 4xxstrong   The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client   seems to have erred.p blockquote  pIt also saysp  blockquote   pstrongServer Error 5xxstrong   Response status codes beginning with the digit 5 indicate cases in   which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of   performing the request.p blockquote  pI take this to mean that if a request is syntactically correct, but logically wrong, such as an attempt to create an object with an invalid value on a specific property, then my API should throw a 5xx Error, because the server DID understand the request, but found it to be invalid. I have, on the other hand, been told that it should be a 4xx error specifically 400 Bad Request because the logical error was on the client side, as it sent an invalid value in the first place.p  pSo, what error code SHOULD I be reportingp

But this is only an extra wish p  pMy current code isp  precodeOptions FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond REQUESTURI sub.domainone.com1 RewriteCond HTTPHOST sub.domainone.com RewriteRule . httpdomaintwo.com1 [P,NC] codepre  pThis code seems to work to an extent it will let me go to sub.domainone.com but if I go to sub.domainone.comclientname it will redirect my browser url to domaintwo.comclientname But I need it hidden p  pThanks heaps in advancedp  pJamesp

Negative 2999 pMy basic idea was to create a linked list, and as each new value comes in, add 1N times the new value and subtract 1N times the first value, then move the pointer to first along by one and free the memory that had been associated with first.p  pThis wont ultimately be implemented in Python but just to get the process clear in my head, I tried to write it in Python, but my implementation is flawed.

Negative 2999 pFirst of let me explain what Im trying to achieve. The application that Im making should have the ability to compare two columns of two different tables with eachother. So every cell of the column from the first table should be linked to the best matching cell from the column of the second table. So you would get something like thisp  pimg srchttpfoto.modelbouwforum.nlimages20141103Levenshteinmatch.png altexamplep  pThis can easily be achieved by using the Levenshteins algorithm. So I wrote a test program in c to see if I can recreate the same results as the image is showing us. I made two arrays, one containing the first column of the image and one containing the second column of the image. Every cell of the first column is compared to every cell of the second column, so that means I get 4 iterations on every cell 16 in total. The highest match the one with the lowest levenshtein distance of the second column is then linked to the cell of the first column. p  pThe problem Let say we have two large columns with 100K rows each, this should get some serious performance issues. Because every cell from the first column need to be matched to every cell of the second column to get the highest possible match, so you have to iterate 100K  100K  10 billion times. So I have to create something to avoid iterating 10 billion times.p  pI did some research about where levenshtein could be used and came across this a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netfullscreenVasileTopacfuzzyhashmap4 relnofollowhttpwww.slideshare.netfullscreenVasileTopacfuzzyhashmap4a. Im wondering if I am able to create something like the guy did in the linkp  pSome things to considerp  ul liIn such large columns there could be multiple matches on a single cellthe user need to chose the right one. So that means you cant exclude previously matched cells from the current search in order to bring down the iteration.li liIn the example the matchingcomparison is only done on two columns, however in the future I like to compare a single column from table 1 to all the columns from table 2 less work for the user.

Negative 2999 pI wonder what conditions must be met so Android stops a codeServicecode, besides the obvious, running low on memory.p  pSee, I run a bootstrapping codeServicecode, holding a local codeBroadcastReceivercode. The service itself contains a state machine and so I transition from one bootstrapping state to another. Each states transition function starts either an codeAsyncTaskcode or an codeIntentServicecode and once its done, it dispatches an codeIntentcode back to emServiceem to let it know that the task was executed successfully. However, during that, the service just stops, and thus the intent is being dispatched into nothing, which is frustrating.p  pI dont want to use a Foreground Service and I dont want to trick around just to keep my service alive. I also dont want to rely on codeonHandleIntentcode of an codeIntentServicecode, since the codeIntentServicecode looses all its states, meaning all members get nulled once ran through, so when stateA is finished and stateB should be kicked off, the whole statemachine is null, all previous states are gone, etc....p  pI commit the codeServicescode context to each codeIntentServicecodecodeAsnycTaskcode and I thought, as long as they hold a reference of the service context, the codeServicecode wont stop. Sadly, this is not the case... p  pDo I have to invoke a method on the context while codedoInBackgroundcode an codeAsyncTaskcode, just to keep the codeServicecode alive or somethingp

Also, theres no way to constrain the image aspect ratio, so we are inputting a new value for the height or width, they adjust independently, leading to stretched and squished images. p  p3 If you click on the font color or highlight color buttons to bring up the color option and click More Colors  selecting Custom Colors tab throws a script error,p  pThis occurred in IE 11.p  pHow do I resolve these issuesp
Negative 2999 pIm studying for a final exam and one of the practice problems given to us from a past exam is as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3RNC7.png altPractice Problemp  pMy instinct says to reduce this problem to the Subset Sum problem. p  pMy initial solution isp  pLet A be the Subset Sum NPComplete problem.p  pLet B be the Partition Problem that we are trying to prove is NPCompletep  pA takes an instance alpha that is a set S and a value bp  pB takes an instance beta that is a set S and a k value for the decisionp  pWe want to polynomially reduce alpha to an instance betap  pI would take b from alpha, put it into the set S to make S, then set k  0 making beta equal to SS union b, K  0p  pLets assume B can solve for this instance. Since it can, it produces an output using beta which was formed from alpha.p  pSince B can solve that instance, it means that A is solvable in polynomial time, however we know this not to be true since A is NPComplete. We have a contradiction. Because of this contradiction, we know that B is at least as hard as A, therefore it too is NP complete. p  pPlease let me know whats wrong with my solution or if it is valid.p  pThanksp

Negative 2999 pCould some give me a hint at this problem   An expression is correct only if it contains parentheses and braces properly closed and no other character, even space.

Negative 2999 pWe have observed that using javascriptbased audio from a browser, the output level is not correctly linearly proportional to the input signal level on many systems.  For example, if you play two sin waves with amplitude varying by 20dB, the resultant difference from different devicessettings may be markedly different from 20dB, e.g. as far off as 10dB or less. We need to put out simple audio signals e.g. sin waves at calibrated decibel levels relative to each other, for example put out one sin wave at one volume, then put out another sin wave that is 20dB quieter than the first one, and have them actually come out that way. We would like to do this from a browser using HTML5javascript.br We have tried to do this in several ways, e.g. using precreated, calibrated .mp3 files, using the Web Audio API directly to generate an oscillator with calibrated dB levels.  We have gotten to us very surprising and basically incorrect results. When we have measured the resulting sounds coming out of the device using a calibrated microphone, all kinds of weird things have been observed, indicating that audio is not just played in a linear way, but complex preprocessing is being done on it before it actually gets output.  This seems to depend on all kinds of variables currently outside of our control.  It does not work the way that a normal audio amplifier works, ie that a 20dB louder input produces a 20dB louder output, whatever the absolute level is set to. We have found that using the same javascript code produces very different results depending on all kinds of variables including the hardware e.g. browsing on Mac vs. iPhone, the volume settings chosen even the emrelativeem values not different by 20dB for 20dB difference in input when volume is at 12, if headphones are used, etc.p  pIn further testing, it appears that the primary problem is related to the use of external speakers.  When using headphones, the results look emmuchem better.p  pThe basic problem is that if you create two different signals with known differences in volume, eg 20dB, and put them both out in any of several ways, the measured difference will often not be 20dB, and is in some cases as bad as 10dB.p  pIs there some way to programmatically do thisp  pIs there a way to override whatever preprocessing or audio volume compression seems to be adjusting the volume causing output that is not correctly proportional to inputp  pWe need a way to do this that will work across platforms desktop, iOS, Android, different browsers, different headphonesspeakers, hence the use of HTML5.p  pIf it isnt possible to do this using HTML5, how can we do it using native iOSAndroid code  This appears to be more of a hardware than a software problem, but perhaps there are ways to override it.p  pThanksp

Negative 2999 pI am working on an Eclipse RCP project with Luna and the exported product works well. The only problem is that the generated main JAR file is too largeover 30MB. I checked the root of this large size. Some thirdparty libs, which are all put inside a folder named lib under my project, are also included into this JAR. I also tried to exclude these libs in binary build and then of course the exported product did not work.p  pI am wondering if there is a way to separate those thirdparty libs from the main JAR file and the exported product can still use them. Thank you very muchp

Negative 2999 pI have a program that simulates serial communication the port send a query and I send a response to the port and does some actions. I display the communication on two richtextboxes, one for received and the other for transmit. The application works fine for a few minutes but then it starts getting sluggish. I check on the task manager and i can see that the memory usage increase from about 50k to 200k in about 20 min or so. Once it gets to 130k, the program does not respond anymore. The only that the program would keep working if I clear the richtextboxes. Once a clear them, the memory reduces back to around 60k and it starts working again but eventually it stops.

Negative 2999 pMy program finds and lists all files located on a remote folder. The same program is able to save new files created into the same folder. I can decide the filename, but I need the program to give some sort of ID to each of them. I would like the program to be able to Count the number of files in the folder at all times, and name the file being saved as the next number in line.p  pSee, I have 10 files in the folder. And I go in to create a new one using the NewCase Event. I write in a bunch of information and in the end hit SaveCase event. I want the program to name the file Somename11p  pAnd then, since its now 11 files in the folder I do the same and create a New Case  Bunch of information  and Save, and the next file will be called Someothername12.p  pI have yet to find any examples that works, but I found many where the number increases if the filename already exists in the folder. I need the Number to increase regardless.p  pI have tried using a Counter that increments each time, but since this program will be used by multiple users at the same time, I need to avoid two users incrementing the same digit.p  pSo by incrementing it by the number of files in the folder would work much better I believe.p  pIf it helps to nail this down, I am unable to use p  pMy.Computer.FileSystem.GetFilesp  pas its remote, and that only wanna search my PC.p  pI am using WinSCP .NET to have an SFTP to the Server.p
Negative 2999 pMy aim is to be able to catch whatever response in Alamofire requests JSON, string before my final competition handler is called and if it is a specific response code than I treat it the same for all responses.p  pI did a wrapper around Alamofire which lets me do specific requests I need login request etc. and there I catch the responses also, but I dont want to treat my error codes that are common globally in every specific request. It seems more naturally to just subclass Alamofire Request and make the treatment there.p  pBut when I subclassed Alamofire Request class, in order for everything else to work I would also have to subclass Alamofire Manager and specifically override the method that returns the Request inside the manager. And that is not possible because inside that method the superclass uses its own private stuff.p  pHow should I proceed in order to make a more clean and nice solutionp

Negative 2999 pIll preface this with the standard Im new to C statement. This is my first time working with arrays and am having some difficulty. p  pI understand arrays in general. I also understand initializing the array. Where I am struggling is with printing specific rowscolumns from my 3D array. Basically, we have a large array of high and low temperatures for three months. The goal is to print various subsets of the array per user request. a hrefhttpcpp.sh7pob relnofollowHerea is the shell of my program. Ive entered only 3 days worth of data for starters. p  pThe functions for calculating average, max, and min were provided. Maybe Im not fully understanding how these functions are operating.p  pI started with something like thisp  precodecase A     cout ltlt Which month J for June, U for July, A for Aug ltlt endl cin gtgt y     switch y          case J         cout ltlt The average for June was  ltlt for i0 iltDAY i                      for j0 jlt1 j                              for k0 kltXTR k                                      averagearray[3][0][2]                                        ltlt endl break codepre  pwhere I am wanting to call the function averagearray to iterate through all 3 days for only month June, and print the result.p  pI also tried replacing things likep  precodeaveragearray[DAY][MONTH][XTR] codepre  por p  precodefor i0 ilt30 i      for j0 jlt1 j              for k0 klt2 k codepre  pAny suggestions are much appreciated Obviously I am going about this entirely the wrong way, and am just not understanding how to reference specific sets of values in the array. The closest our textbook gets to explaining this is iterating through 1D and 2D arrays and printing the result. This is a small assignment, but understanding this is the key to completing our next and last large project.p

Negative 2999 pI am creating a GUI structure, where obviously I have two main parameters width and height. For simplification lets pretend these are my only values. I am developing this in C.p  pI have an XML file which builds up the structure hierarchy of the widget and I have a CSS like file, which gives the values width and height for each node in the structure. When the program starts I read and parse these files. Now my question is about what is the best practice to store the variables from my CSS like filep  pIf the width and height parameters would only be numbers, than the answer is easy, since I store them in an int for example. But in my case in my CSS like file I can give the value parent or child to width and height, which means that their dimension is the same as their parent or child node.p  pA simple solution would be to assign some numbers negative numbers for example to parent and child, while parsing them, but this doesnt look to elegant.p  pAn other solution, which came into my mind to create a struct where I can store two bool variable and one int for example and the bool variables would indicate if it should be parent or child, but for some reason this also doesnt look too elegant for me, but I might be wrong.p  pDoes anybody have any advice, maybe other solutions or knows a best practice in cases like this All help, hints are much appreciatedp

Negative 2999 pDoes anyone know how to identify the user objectID when their iOS app is launched from a Facebook Notification  Request  Importantly, can you also do it offline Ive had complaints that FB Notifications take you into the app but leave you in someone elses account.  p  pApple Store is rejecting apps that use Facebook login discovering this bad experience. Meetup App groups and Apple Store suggest removing Facebook login and replacing it with a login that provides a better experience.p  pIm hoping Im missing something obvious.p  pExample Situation On the familys iPad, Sally was logged in on Facebooks FriendSmash game and sent Mike a challenge.  Later Mike logged into the iPads Facebook App and clicked the AppLink Notification which opened FriendSmash.  BUT...Facebook opened FriendSmash still using Sallys credentials, so Mike was in Sallys account trying to smash Sally.p  pEven with no internet connection, the Facebook app will still send you to the game app, so the game app needs a way to determine if the incoming user is the same as the user currently logged in even if the only thing you track is highscores.p  pMy current games allow you to switch users by storing tokens basically using Facebooks SwitchUserSample to manage tokens.  These users can send requests out Beat my score....  p  pWhen Facebook launches my app, I can only find who the request came FROM Sally, and not who clicked on the notification to answer it Mike.  If Mike clicked on the link, I need to know that when my game is launched.p  pIf the user has previously authorized the game, you sometimes get a 1 hour temporary token, though older notifications sometimes arrive already expired. If not, the only hint seems to be a requestid that can include multiple users and is completely useless offline. p  pI really need an offline solution, but Ill settle for an online solution. So far the only option I found was to send the user BACK to the Facebook app to identify the current user, though this does not work in airplane mode. This also causes windows to flicker back and forth and confuses the launch and token states.

Negative 2999 pI have a site running on godaddy hosting yes I know... that holds up to 100 concurrent php processes. Lately the site has started receiving 503 errors and the processes max out. p  pI know this has been discussed before in relevance to Wordpress but thats the kicker... I am not running WP nor am I using mysqlpconnect. The processes just stay and stack up until I manually kill them.p  pI connect to a database and run 34 select statements and thats all. Godaddy support was useless and I have no log of what script is calling the process.  p  pWithout a in depth analysis of the code or being able to see certain logs what steps can I take in order to narrow down what is causing the issue It occurs randomly through the day and doesnt match up to high usage either. I can have 130 users with no problems but get 503 errors with 30 users. p  pThanks for any help as I am pulling out my hair...p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Finally got access to view processes and stats. The processes are definitely going over the time limit on the server. Talked to server support and they said there is an issue with a few boxes that they have added my server into that issue list. Crossing fingers but doubting that will be the fix. p  pI ran an strace p on a process that ran for 10 minutes... the trace shows it basically going from page to page... pausing then accessing another page. I tied that process to a google bot. Is that normal Out of 53 processes active 52 were sleeping.. These sleepers go from anywhere to 20 seconds to 10 minutes. running a trace on a few showed a LOCK which i assume means it is pausing to receive. You will notice when running top the php process that is sticking... this one when traced just loads a page, sleeps on a timer, loads another page... This is when my site is dead so you can imagine when it is busy to have these processes running for so long. I have no scripts or anything that do such a thing on the site. I have a long trace report that i can message or email but is too long to post here.p  precodetop  173158 up 6 days,  917,  0 users,  load average 6.16, 7.77, 7.15 Tasks   8 total,   1 running,   7 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie Cpus 16.1us,  7.1sy,  0.0ni, 70.6id,  6.1wa,  0.0hi,  0.2si,  0.0st Mem  32741960k total, 27249096k used,  5492864k free,  1930272k buffers Swap  8388604k total,        0k used,  8388604k free, 12611492k cached    PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S CPU MEM    TIME  COMMAND             2617 user  20   0  346m  30m  11m S  0.7  0.1   006.95 php                 19181 user  20   0  4404  784  676 S  0.7  0.0   001.80 strace              11404 user  20   0  105m 1936  948 S  0.0  0.0   000.03 sshd                11410 user  20   0 11476 1680 1348 S  0.0  0.0   000.01 bash                15425 user  20   0 14908 1148  960 R  0.0  0.0   000.49 top                 17913 user  20   0  105m 1944  948 S  0.0  0.0   000.32 sshd                17945 user  20   0 11476 1672 1348 S  0.0  0.0   000.00 bash                24294 user  20   0  332m  16m  10m S  0.0  0.1   001.14 php    codepre

Negative 2999 pIm working with convolutional deep neural networks CRBM in particular. I need to perform several valid convolution and several full convolutions. I need to optimize their speed. Im working with C. p  pIn the case of the valid convolution I have been able to speed it up by around 50 by rearranging the image This is the equivalent of emim2colem in Matlab and multiplying matrix multiply by the matrix of kernels one per line, replacing several convolutions by one matrix multiplication. p  pUnfortunately, I havent been able to gain anything with full convolution. I know that I can also rearrange the image using an equivalent of emconvmtx2em in Matlab, but simply doing the rearranging of the image matrix to a convolution matrix is already much slower almost an order of magnitude than doing all the convolutions. The convolution matrix becomes large very quickly. p  pIs there a good practical way of speeding full convolution with multiple kernels up with matrix multiplication in C  Perhaps, an efficient way of computing convmtx2  p

Negative 2999 pI am writing an Angular application that has a ScalaPlay backend and a MongoDB. Im new to unit testing and Im trying to wrap my head around how to test the Mongo calls. p  pThe app was designed by someone else and Ive inherited it. The backend is very generic there are only four API services defined  save, find, delete, and generate newID. The angular calls take in a collection name and maybe an ID.p  pI have written tests to make sure a particular method processes data in the way that I expect, but I am lost when it comes to testing the Mongo part. p  pFor example, lets say I have two objects  Apples and Oranges. I could have methods such as thesep  precodemyAppleSvc.getApple id gt     myDataSvc.find apples, idid myOrangeSvc.getOrange id gt     myDataSvc.find oranges, id id codepre  pThe lower level data svc would do something like thisp  precodemyDataSvc.find collection, query gt     deferredq.defer     doPost apiv1findJsoncollection, query, deferred     return deferred.promise codepre  pThe doPost function is a helper method that handles the successfailurep  precodedoPost path, data, deferred gt     http.post path, data     .success result gt deferred.resolve result     .error result gt deferred.reject result codepre  pThere are some other things going on in the codebase, but this is the basic pattern.p  pI am trying to understand the best way to test this code. Most of my calls just return a promise to be resolved. How would I test the getOrange and getApple calls As far as I can tell, all I can do is make sure they are returning a promise. With the dataSvc.find call, it seems all I need to do is make sure that it calls the correct URL and also returns a promise. Am I missing somethingp

Negative 2999 pI am implementing an mobile app for android and iOS and I am using GAE with the datastore for persistance as the server side of my app. My app uses facebook login for user authentication. One of the key aspects of the app is that users can interact with each other through the app but I want to keep their actual facebookid secret so that user cannot discover the facebook profile of another user through my app.p  pMy original design for this was using MySQL and there I had a simple implementation of a users table with the table primary key, an autoincrement integer served as the user id for the app. So I could safely send the user id of other users to the client app, and this did not give away any information I did not want to give away. When a user logs in, the client app performs all the necessary facebook login procedures and sends the facebook access token to the server. The server would extract the facebook user information from this token chech if a user with this id already exists, if so use this user row, otherwise create a new one.p  pOn an SQL database this works great since it is strongly consistent, and there is no way I will miss the fact that the user is already in the table. However now when I am using the eventual consistent datastore with the same idea, I ran into a problem where if a user logs in for the first time ever, an entry is added to the datastore, but then if the user logs in again shortly after the query I am performing to check if a User entity with the same facebookid is already present this query sometimes still return no results. This leads to the same facebook id being assosiated with 2 different users of my app and this is obviously bad.p  pI know this seems like an unlikely scenario, but I actually accidentally ran into it during developmentp  pI thought of a few ways to mitigate thisp  ol lipInstead of using the app user id as the entity key use the facebook id, this ensures consistency since there is no index involved in the lookup now. This would imply I need to use the facebook id as the id for my app and this violates one of the design principles the facebook id of other users will now leak to the client app.pli lipInstead of relying on the datastore generated entity key id for the user, specify the id myself, by performing some sort of deterministic manipulation of the facebook user id, such as a hashing it or encrypting it. This way I can use the key to perform the lookup and no matter how many times the same user logs in their user id will be generated the same. But this seems like too heavy an approach to do correctly. If I hash it I will need to make sure to use a good hashing algorithm to prevent collisions. A good hash or encryption will output a long string as a user id, which is not too bad, but I would like to keep the user id as a simple long integer value if possible.pli lipAccept the fact that this is eventually consistent, during a log in if we find more then one corresponding entity, delete them and stay with one. This is bad, because what if the user has already performed some operations that are stored on the previous entity I will have to run through all the data for the multiple user entities from the same user and perform some sort of merging operation on them. This will also require me to run through other entities that store the user id and change them all.pli lipUse memcache to store the user, this will probably make this scenario even more unlikely, but not eliminate it entirely. Memcache entries can be evicted prematurely, and in this case we are back to swaure one. pli ol  pWhat is the best approach here Is there something I am missing Would really appropriate your input.p

Then the program peeks the priority queue amp selects the least cost node front of queue and then searches again recursive call to above search method with that particular node as startNode and the search continues.br When the program reaches the new nodes, the cost at each new node should get the cumulative cost of the path visited so far and the program should output the path and the cost. p

Negative 2999 pServer is a Opensips server 1.10.0tls linux. It can handle conversations tofrom local stations and recently it has been updated to allow stations from external systems. It does this by changing the username, ip and port in the ru if the station doesnt exist locally tu is untouched. This works fine for invites, calls and all similar messages.p  pThe problem Im having is that byes coming from the external server, that are being passed on to the local client station, are being rejected by a 481 call legtransaction does not exist that i can confirm is coming from the client software, yet it accepts byes from local stations on the same server without any bother. Calls from local to local end ok, calls from local to external all shutdown ok, its just calls from external caller to local callee that wont close it is the callee that is saying 481.p  pI understand this is caused by transaction matching not occurring due to something different in the tags in the tofrom and the callid i understand that something like my ru script that changes parts of the ru might have an effect on the hash to determine the transaction, but i dont change the tags or the callid, just the ru name to make it go to the right IP and station name.p  pMy question is how do i go about solving this on the server without changing the client applications Ive included some examples of the messages being sent below taken from a wireshark capture on the client workstation, so im unsure what im doing wrong..Ive tried different things on the server with no luck. Is there a way to mark or tell the client via sip messages to shutdown the conversation regardless of transaction matchingp  pI would greatly appreciate any aid in this as Ive been pulling my hair out about this for some time.p  pMessage examples for External caller 103 on server 5.44 to Local Callee local name is wks2, external ref name is 155, on server 3.3, client is 3.0.

Negative 2999 pHistorybr We are delivering .mp4 video via http partial request streaming.  It works fine except on iPadiPhone and we have followed all of the recommended procedures for encoding .mp4 files for iOS devices so the issue is not the files themselves.  The video files are stored outside of the root of the web server so we have written code to open and stream the video upon request.  Our testing has brought us to the point of comparing the headers of our streamed video working but not in IOS and linking directly to the file working in all instances but not a possible solution as we need to store files outside of web root.

I want to remove the CSS property when the wScroll is outside the range.p  precode.img.eachfunction           var sectionOffset  this.offset.top         var attID  this.attridattID  attID.toString         if wScroll gt sectionOffset ampamp wScroll lt sectionOffset  sectionHeight              addCSSattID               function addCSSelement          element.css             position fixed,             top stickyPosition  75,             left OffsetLeft               function removeCSSelement          element.css             position ,             top ,             left            codepre  pI tried modifying it this way but it makes it jump p  precode.img.eachfunction           var sectionOffset  this.offset.top         var attID  this.attridattID  attID.toString         if wScroll gt sectionOffset ampamp wScroll lt sectionOffset  sectionHeight              addCSSattID                  else if wScroll gt sectionOffset  sectionHeight  wScroll lt sectionOffset              removeCSSattID               codepre  pI managed to get it working smoothly without using an array, but the code is a bit long and I was hoping to simplify it without losing function. p  pHere is a simplified version a hrefhttpcodepen.ioebeverspenxwbdbP relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioebeverspenxwbdbPa for this, I just need the squares to jump back into place.

Negative 2999 pIm trying to authenticate my user on my site using StackExchange OAuth API.p  pEverything works fine when the user signs up for the first time. At this point, I get the access token, which I save in my DB.p  pBut the next time the user signs in, access token value is actually different to the previous one. Is it supposed to be like thisp  pIf then, how do I check for existing users who already have signed up using StackExchangep  pI can get the users information by giving a specific site name e.g. stackoverflow. But what if I dont have that information and I need to check that the user has already signed in via StackExchangep  pIs there a user information that I can get given an accessTokenp

I have a hypothetical big class Thing.  Things are big and thus costly to make, but while they are used everywhere in the code shared, passed around liberally, modified, stored for later use, etc., they are often not actually used in the end, so delaying their actual creation until they are actually accessed is preferable.  Thing thus needs to be lazilycreated, plus needs to be shareable.  Lets call this encapsulating pointer wrapper SharedThing.p  precodeclass SharedThing    ...
