Positive 1141 pIm reviewing some code and I came across a line that does the followingp  precodePerson.findbyname Tom.id codepre  pThe above code gets the FIRST record with a name of Tom, then builds a model, then gets the id of that model.  Since we only want the id, the process of retreiving all data in the model and initializing the model is unneeded.  Whats the best way to optimize this using active record queries  p  pId like to avoid a raw sql solution.  So far I have been able to come up withp  precodePerson.wherename Tom.pluckid.first codepre  pThis is faster in some situations since codepluckcode doesnt build the actual model object and doesnt load all the data.  However, codepluckcode is going to build an array of records with name Tom, whereas the original statement only ever returns a single object or nil  so this technique could potentially be worse depending on the codewherecode statement.  Id like to avoid the array creation and potential for having a very long list of ids returned from the server.  I could add a codelimit1code in the chain,p  precodePerson.wherename Tom.limit1.pluckid.first codepre  pbut is seems like Im making this more complicated than it should be.p
Positive 1141 pI am working on my first real Rails 4 app and I have run into a problem with my design. p  pCurrently I have a Service model which started out with attributes such as name, onlinestatus, ip, dnsname, port, and servicetype. This model has evolved to include many methods and attributes for specific servicetypes like authtokens, etc. and thus it is very overgrown. The columns added to the database to accommodate the needs of the different types of services make this model act like a ghetto version of STI without separate classesmodels.p  pThe Service model also has methods such as ping which is used to determine the onlinestatus. I believe the types of services are different enough to warrant their own separate tables because each service seems to have many unique properties and methods.p  pExamplep  pA generic service has name, ip, dnsname, onlinestatus, etc...p  pA specific service such as Plex will have name, ip, dnsname, onlinestatus, username, password, authtoken, etc... p  pThe issue, is that I would like to be able to access the more specific types of services from their parent Service class. So when I create a view, I can loop through all the generic services and the more specific services as if they were all the same type of service or at least be able to access all services in some simple way without looping through each type and appending them. p  pI also need to access the specific types of models on their own, so doing something like couchpotatos.each in my view will only go through the instances of the Couchpotato class.p  pControllers play into this confusion too since I dont exactly know how to have a single page display all these different types of models from the same controller.p

Positive 1141 pI am building an ActiveAdmin page, backed by an ActiveRecord model, codeModelAcode, that has a codehasonecode relationship to another model, well call it codeImagecode. I want to design it so that codeModelAcode can have one of two subclasses of codeImagecode, called codeImageMobilecode and codeImageDesktopcode, to be determined after codeImagecode is created but before it is saved. Here is what my models look likep  precodeclass ModelA lt ActiveRecordBase     hasone image, classname Image     acceptsnestedattributesfor image end  class Image lt ActiveRecordBase     attraccessible attachment end  class ImageDesktop lt Image     DEFAULTWIDTH  1500      if definedPaperclip         hasattachedfile attachment,              styles                  scale1x DEFAULTWIDTH,                 scale2x DEFAULTWIDTH2,                            end      Do some stuff with DEFAULTWIDTH end  class ImageMobile lt Image     DEFAULTWIDTH  400      if definedPaperclip         hasattachedfile attachment,              styles                  scale1x DEFAULTWIDTH,                 scale2x DEFAULTWIDTH2,                            end end codepre  pSo the subclasses each have a codeDEFAULTWIDTHcode that is unique to it and necessary for Paperclip to do image manipulation. Following, is my ActiveAdmin code for uploading the image to attach to codeModelAcode.p  precode    form do f         f.inputs Details do             if f.object.image.nil                 f.object.buildimage             end             f.hasmany image, newrecord false, allowdestroy false do img                 img.input attachment, required true, as file             end         end          f.actions do             f.action submit, label Create             f.action cancel, label Cancel         end     end codepre  pIm wondering if there is a way to branch on the codehasonecode, either through a callback or whatever, so I can choose which of the subclasses to use depending on the image that I upload through ActiveAdminp

Positive 1141 pin a Rails 3 application there are two models assinged to each other by strongbelongstostrong and stronghasonestrong.

Negative 1141 pDumb question Im sure, but why does Entity Framework EntityDataSource object require the where clause to contain strongitstrong as the first part of the object selectorp  pThe documentation for the where clause a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc488531.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc488531.aspxa states that the string is passed directly to the ObjectQueryT, so I should be able to pass in for example strongxstrong.OnlineOrderFlag  TRUE where x is anything that makes sense in a predicate, however the clause only works if I pass in strongitstrong.OnlineOrderFlag  TRUEp  pAll of the Microsoft examples use it so what am I missingp  pSteve Daviesp

Negative 1141 pHow do you go about creating an instance of an object when given the class name as a string in an ASP.NET v2 application For example, Ive got a class called SystemLog defined in the appcode section of the application.

Negative 1141 pIm writing a webserver in Python as a hobby project. The code is targeted at NIX machines. Im new to developing on Linux and even newer to Python itself.p  pI am worried about people breaking out of the folder that Im using to serve up the website. The most obvious way to do this is to filter requests for documents like ....etcpasswd. However, Im worried that there might be clever ways to go up the directory tree that Im not aware of and consequentially my filter wont catch. p  pIm considering adding using the os.chroot so that the root directory is the website itself. Is this is a safe way of protecting against these jail breaking attacks Are there any potential pitfalls to doing this that will hurt me down the roadp

The commercial client app displays these characters correctly, but my application is displaying them as an inverted question mark.  The Oracle character set is WE8ISO8859P1.p  pMy application reads the commercial database using System.Data.OracleClient.OracleDataAdapter, converted into a table via DataSet.Tables.  The tablerows are converted into objects, and the fields in question are stored as strings.  p  pIf I examine in the debugger the data in the DataSet immediately after reading it from the db, and the special characters are already displayed incorrectly.  I cant figure out how to examine the data as hex bytes to see whats really there, nor am I certain what I should be looking for.p  pI have also noted that Toad displays the characters as inverted question marks as well.  p  pOne aspect of our application writes these records to a separate table in our own database when that occurs the special characters get modified, and subsequently display as boxes instead of upsidedown question marks.p  pI can provide further information if needed.  Thank you for any and all helpp

Negative 1141 pI am implementing a tree browser in HTML. On clicking a node, I call a function that adds the nodes child elements. So far so good. I now want to immediately invoke the click handler of one of the child elements to expand that too. My problem is that jQuery cant find the child elements that have just been added. When I step through in the debugger, my code to find the elements is being invoked before the new elements get rendered by the browser, which Im guessing is the problem.p  pIs there some event I can wait for similar to onload maybe that marks when the newly added HTML is visible Or a method I can call to force the rendering to take place earlier Any suggestions would be welcome.p  pNote I have since realised that the problem was entirely my fault, not the browsers or jQuerys.

Negative 1141 pI wrote a RESTful servlet, and the UI developer wants to save the loggedin state on the server.p  pHe made this strange claim  I havent encountered a production REST implementation that is pure REST.  The ones Ive seen all have had the server maintain a session.p  pI find this difficult to accept.  First theres the technicality that there are plenty of plain HTTP pages out there, all purely RESTful.  Second, yes, there are nonRESTful implementations labeled RESTful, just like theres brass labeled gold.  Third, just because everyone else jumps off a bridge doesnt mean I should.p  pBackground  Its a JavaScript Ajax web application using HTTPS and Basic authentication.  To avoid the usual uncustomizeable browser login popup box, the application shows a login screen with the product logo and text boxes for name and password.  The name and password are stored in the document and sent in the Authorization header for each request.  If you refresh the page, the name and password are lost and the user must type them in again.  Thats considered a bug the UI developer wants to be able to press the refresh button without giving the password again.p  pSo the developer wants to use a cookie or a JSP session.  Abby, is it true that in the end every REST implementation maintains application state on the server  Or is there a way I can solve this problem and still maintain my RESTful purityp

Negative 1141 pI am using Google Maps API v3 on a website I am developing. I have a dropdown box beneath my map which allows the user to switch between different sets of markers to be displayed on the map. Each marker is displayed using marker.setMap.p  pMy problem is that the map sometimes takes a long time to display the new markers, especially in IE. I want to show a Loading animation while the map is switching markers. But I dont know how to detect when the map has finished displaying the new data there is no page load, since this is all AJAX. Is there a callback or event listener for a setMap event, so I can call a function to stop the Loading animation when the last marker has finished loadingp

Negative 1141 pThis sounds like a pretty easy question to answer but I havent been able to get it to work.  Im running PHP 5.2.6.p  pI have a DOM element the root element which, when I go to elementsaveXML, it outputs an xmlns attributep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standaloneyesgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml langengt ... codepre  pHowever, I cannot find any way programmatically within PHP to see that namespace.  I want to be able to check whether it exists and what its set to.p  pChecking codedocumentgtdocumentElementgtnamespaceURIcode would be the obvious answer but that is empty Ive never actually been able to get that to be nonempty.  What is generating that xmlns value in the output and how can I read itp  pThe only practical way Ive been able to do this so far is a complete hack  by saving it as XML to a string using saveXML then reading through that using regular expressions.p  pEditp  pThis may be a peculiarity of loading XML in using loadHTML rather than loadXML and then printing it out using saveXML.  When you do that, it appears that for some reason saveXML adds an xmlns attribute even though there is no way to detect that this xmlns value is part of the document using DOM methods.  Which I guess means that if I had a way of detecting whether the document passed in had been loaded in using loadHTML then I could solve this a different way.p
Negative 1141 pI have a web based application which servers content to authenticated users by interacting with a soap server.  The soap server has files which the users need to be able to download. p  pWhat is the best way to serve these files to users  When a user requests a file, my server will make a soap call to the soap server to pull the file and then it will serve it to the user via referencing the link to it.  p  pThe question is that these temporary files need to be cleaned up at some point and my first thought was this being a linux based system, store them in tmp and let the system take care of cleanup.  p  precodeIs it possible to store these files in tmp and have apache serve them  to the user   codepre  pIf apache cannot access tmp since it is outside of the web root, potentially I could create a symbolic link to tmpfilename within the web root  This would require cleanup of the symbolic links though at some point. p  pSuggestionscomments appreciated on best way to manage these temporary files  p  precodeI am aware that I could write a script and have it executed as a cron job on  regular intervals but was wondering if there was a way similar to presented  above to do this and not have to handle deleting the files  codepre
Negative 1141 pI am working with a client who has an ERP system in place, called M1, that they are looking to make custom changes to.p  pI have spent a little bit of time investigating the ERP system in terms of making customizations.  Here is a list of what I have found with regards to custom changesp  ul liCustom changes cannot be exportedimported.  There is an option in the M1 Design Studio, however, they always appear to be disabled... I tried everything and I couldnt find a mention of it in the help documentation.li liYou can export a customizations change log CSV, XML, Excel, HTML that provides type, name, location and description.  In essence, it is a readonly document that provides a list of changes you made.  You cannot modify the contents of this log.li liCustom form changes made, go into effect for all data sources Test, Stage, LIVE.  In other words, there does not appear an ability to limit the scope of a form change.li liCustom field changes must be made in each data source Test, Stage, LIVE.  Whats odd here is that if add a field in Test, adjust a grid to display it, subsequently change to LIVE, it detects that the field doesnt exist and negates the grid changes.li liIm unable to find documentation indicating that this application supports version control.li ul  pemsighemp  p....p  pSo...p  pHow do I manage changes from an SDLC ALM methodology and tools standpointp  pI could start by bringing in a change request system to manage pending and completed customizations.  But then what  How should changes me managed and released  Put backups of application under source control and deploy when neededp  pThere might not be a good answer to this question since Im unable to take advantage of version control and create a separation of environments, but I figured Id ask in case anybody has had similar experience or worked with M1.p

Negative 1141 pWe have a rather extensive test suite that takes forever to execute. After each test has completed, the database MSSQL needs to be emptied so it is fresh for the next testcase. The way we do this is by temporarily removing all foreign keys, TRUNCATEing all tables, and readding the FKs.p  pThis step takes somewhere between 23 seconds, according to NHProfiler. All the time is seemingly spent with the FK operations.p  pOur current method is clearly not optimal, but which way should we go to improve the performance  The number of elements which are actually deleted from the DB is completely insignificant compared to the number of operations for the FK removaladditions.p  pUsing an inmemory SQLite database is not an option, as the code under test uses MSSQL specific operations.p

Negative 1141 pWe are trying to build some RESTful services with Spring MVC. We will be providing several representations XML, HTML, amp JSON. We would like to use JiBX as the OXM technology.p  pWe are currently having difficulty figuring out how to wire up Spring with JiBX. If we want to wire up a single class, for example codeCustomercode, we simply define a codeJibxMarshallercode, an XML codeMarshallingViewcode, and add it too our codeContentNegotiatingViewResolvercode. This works great.p  pThe problem is we arent sure how to wire up marshalling of multiple classes, for example, codeCustomercode and codeUsercode. Each codeJibxMarshallercode can support only one class unlike the Jaxb2Marshaller which can support many. We tried declaring a marshaller for each class, but the codeMarshallingViewcode only support one marshaller. Declaring multiple codeMarshallingViewcodes does not work it appears only the first one works. p  pYour advice is appreciated.

I thought it meant the marshaller would only work for a single class, however, it appears to just uses the target class as a way of finding all related bindings.

I tried overriding the codeonTouchEventcode and the codeonInterceptTouchEventcode, but these arent always called. p  pI took a look at the source for the codeSpinnercode, and noticed that Google is using an Dialog for what I believe to be its dropdown how it is being positioned is beyond me at this point. p  pIs there any way I can have my codeViewcode intercept ALL touch events on the codeWindowcodep

Negative 1141 pI have a PHP site, and for real time updates and chat I have installed Node.js and its running fine.p  pBoth PHP and Node.js have access to the same MySQL database.p  pBut the problem is to verify the identity of an user, who is already logged in to the PHP site.p  pI dont want to talk to the PHP app via any means, REST or not. As, to me this will defeat the same purpose of using Node.js, as then each Node.js request, a new PHP page request would be made. p  pWhat I want is, a encryption and decryption method which is understood by both PHP and node.jsp  pSo that I can set a cookie with the encrypted value for Node.js request, which will be at updates.mydomain.com subdomain. By reading the cookie, Node.js can decrypt its value and verify the users identity.p  pSo, my question is there any encrypt and corresponding decrypt method that is supported via both PHP and Node.js, using same encryption keyp  pstrongUpdatesstrongp  pActually i m not looking forward to decrypt it on client side D as then the whole point of decryption is pointless. What i want to do is  p  p1 PHP to generate a cookie encrypted user info and use that cookie for a specific domain like updates.mydomain.com p  p2 Then node.js will get the cookie for each subsequent request, and decrypt the data on server side, using the same encryption key.p  pAs u can see, that is why i wanted to know, if there is a common encryptiondecryption system between PHP and node.js, so that encrypted data by one can be decrypted by the other and vice versa.p  pThis way i can securly transfer the current logged in users identity from PHP to node.js and i dont have to worry about session management of other kinds p  pSo in short, Encrypt by PHP  Decrypt by Node.js  get back same data. Possiblep  pThanks,br Anjanp

To make a long story short, IE specifically, strongwininet.dllstrong leaks connections under certain circumstances. The only suggested workaround is to explicitly kill all Internet Explorer process instances after running a Test. A fix is not likely since this has been an issue for YEARS, and they are afraid of breaking compatibility with existing applications.p  pFYI, here is what Microsoft has to sayp  blockquote   pThe best workaround would probably to   kill and restart IE at some interval   during your test run automation.  You   can restart IE at some regular   interval or have some kind of   detection logic in your code.  When   you get into this situation IE wont   be able to make any request out so I   would expect the application to   receive a strongBeforeNavigatestrong event if   you sink this event set up a timer   and by the time the timer fires check   to see if you ever get a   strongDocumentCompletestrong event for the URL which you probably wont.  This is a   good indication that you run into the   problem so you can proceed to kill and   restart the IE process at this point.p      p...this approach is not addressing the   root cause of wininet connection loss   but at the same time there arent any   practical approach within your control   to do this.  Just to provide some   perspective on how you get into this   situationp      pWhenever there are ActiveX components   such as msxml making an AJAX request   making an HTTP request and the Tab   window hosting that component is   closed before the response is   received, there is a chance IE will   lose that wininet connection if the   ActiveX does not abort the call.  This   is exactly what happened in the hertz   scenario.  The page has script running   to issue an AJAX request.  IE window   is then closed before the response   comes back.  Upon part of tearing down   the page, IE calls into the ActiveX   MSXML in this case to notify the   control upon shutting down.  The   control can then abort that connection   upon being destroyed.  MSXML does not   abort the connection here leading to   the leak.  The issue is deeply rooted   in IEs design architecture and how it   interacts with 3rd party components.    Because of this you will most likely   encounter this issue on web sites that   have AJAX requests.  Over the years   there are multiple bugs opened against   this issue but all those bugs were   rejected due to high application   compat risk.  Part of the difficulty   in providing a fix is that IE does not   always know that the ActiveX is the   one making a connection.p      pWininet does not expose any mechanism   for a 3rd party control to reset or   clean up the wininet connection loss.    By default IE67 has 2 connections per   server while IE8 has 6 so this   behavior is probably less visible in   IE8.  There is a registry key   documented here   a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb183110 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb183110a   you can try to increase the number of   available connections.  However this   is only delaying the problem.  This is   why I mentioned the only supportable   way to reset the wininet state is to   restart the IE process.p blockquote

Negative 1141 pI am working on a project which requires the use of Google Maps and is aimed for tablet PCs running the Android OS. We have purchased an Archos 101 Internet Tablet to test our implementation, but what I have quickly noticed is that any application that I install which uses Google Maps immediately crashes on startup throwing a ClassNotFoundException on the class which extends MapActivity. I then learned that Archos is not a Googlecertified device and apparently does not support the Google Maps API. p  pI understand that we may need to acquire a Tablet which is confirmed to work with Google APIs for Android. p  pI wanted to know if anyone has ever tried to develop a Google Maps application on one of these tabletsp  pAs a follow up, what tablet would you suggest for developing a Google Maps application p  pstrongEDITstrong I have tested the same implementation successfully on both the Android Emulator and a Nexus One phone. I want to stress that the issue seems to be the lack of support for Google Maps on the Archos 101 tablet. Also, this is just a prototype, and we are not developing anything for the market quite yet, so the workaround is acceptable in this case.p

Negative 1141 pMy program.cs calls the mdi parent frmMain. frmMain then opens different child forms based on user action. p  pAll the processing logic is written in BusinessLogic.cs. frmMain at load calls the methods of BusinessLogic.cs to initially populate the data. The child forms too call BusinessLogic to fetch data and process it. Id like to do all this through a BackGroundWorker ie the frmMain calls the say StartBGWorker method of BusinessLogic.cs and this method creates a backgroundworker for this specific call, calls the Dowork event, does the fetching amp processing and closes when done.p  pIm at a loss about how to create the instance and the events for backgroundworker. So how exactly do I use backgroundworker in a class file p  pEdit Maybe my logic is wrong and I should add a BGW to each form that calls BusinessLogig.cs. Then whenever I call a method of BusinessLogic I can do so through backgroundworker. Would this be a better implementationp  pEdit2 Feel a bit idiotic about my doubt now that I found a way. I just created a public static method with the initialize code of BGW in BusinessLogic. Now whenever I need to do processing I first call this method from my forms.  Id like to know if my implementation of BGW is standard or is there any way to improve the design. p

Negative 1141 pSo Im having problems releasing some view controllers. In essence the dealloc for the PhotoPostViewController never seems to get called, so I cant clear down the images contained within that are munching all the memory.p  pThis is my UIViewController subclass, I can have up to 100 of these at any one time added as subviews to the main scroll view, the iPad gets tight for memory after that.p  precodeinterface PhotoPostViewController  UIViewController      IBOutlet UIImageView backgroundImage     IBOutlet UIImageView serviceImage  codepre  pThen in my main view class I have a method to create these views and add them to a scrollView. This method is typically called from a loop to create all the subviews I need.p  precode void addPost      PhotoPostViewController postView  [[PhotoPostViewController alloc] initWithNibNamePhotoPostViewController bundlenil]     [scrollView addSubview[postView view]]     [viewControllers addObjectpostView]   codepre  pviewControllers is an NSMutableArray created in the main class init. scrollView is a UIScrollView on my main view.p  pThis all works fine, I know the limit of the memory usage on the iPad and keep within that at any given time, opening Popovers to give preview images and videos etc... Doesnt run out of memory until I try to refresh the screen. The code to do this isp  precode IBActiondidPressRefreshidsender      forUIView subview in [scrollView subviews]          [subview removeFromSuperview]          forUIViewController c in viewControllers          [c release]          [viewControllers removeAllObjects]  codepre  pFor the sake of simplicity I clear off all the subviews and try to release them before recreating the next set of subviews using the function above. It removes them from the view, but runs out of memory adding the new set of view controllers. In my test cases the sets of view controllers are identical in content, so if it loads from clean first time, then it should load the second time and every other time after that if I release everything properly.p  pWhat actually happens is it crashes due to low memory when creating the second set of view controllers.p  pWhile debugging Ive put breakpoints on the viewDidUnload and dealloc methods, but they never get hit.p  pIt looks like the UIViewController itself is getting released, yet the UIImageViews within are not, clearly theyd usually get released by my code in the dealloc or viewDidUnload method.p  pSo Im confused.

Negative 1141 pI have a sliding carousel of items, each of which includes its own like button. I want the like buttons to have comments that is, when the user clicks Like, he should be presented with a prompt to leave a comment a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comblogpost397 relnofollowhttpdevelopers.facebook.comblogpost397a. Im starting to doubt that these goals are compatible and would like to hear if anyone has already achieved it.p  pThe comments on the Like buttons are wider than the items in the carousel, and correctly overflow onto other carousel items. However, some of these items are outside the clipping box, since the carousel items are necessarily inside a div with overflow hidden otherwise we wouldnt achieve the effect of the items scrolling into existence upon paging. Because of this, if I click Like on the rightmost item currently visible, the comments prompt that appears will be partially outside the clipping box and thus partially visible.p  pIt appears to me the only possible hope of allowing the comments prompt to overflow the carousel container is to place the prompt outside the container in the dom. This way, assuming we can visually position the prompt next to its Like button where it belongs, its no longer constrained by the container. This seems within possible, since at the time of this writing the comment prompt is implemented as a separate iframe from the button itself i.e., this XFBMLp  precodeltfblike width450gtltfblikegt codepre  pyields approximately this HTMLp  precodeltiframe srcfacebook.comlikebutton.phpgtltiframegt ltiframe srcfacebook.comcommentswidget.phpgtltiframegt codepre  pBut if I try to move the comments iframe in the dom, it instantly and permanently becomes empty. Even if I could find a way to detach certain events and prevent this, it shows that an intricate solution is called for, and one which Facebook can break at any time in the future with changes to their implementation. Thus, I cant move the comments in the dom, and thus, the prompt is always in danger of being clipped. Facebook says this on the subjectp  blockquote   pIf the Like button is placed near the edge of an HTML element with the overflow property set to hidden, the flyout may be clipped or completely hidden when the button is clicked. This can be remedied by setting setting the overflow property to a value other than hidden, such as visible, scroll, or auto.p blockquote  pClearly in the case of a carousel its not possible to remove overflow hidden. Has anyone found a way around this, or should I give up and spend my time elsewherep  pThanksp

Negative 1141 pI am editing a GUI written in MATLAB and have a line in the OpeningFcn that sets the callback for resizing the figure.p  precodesethObject, UserData, handles.ParentFig, ResizeFcn,cbFigResize, CloseRequestFcn, Cancel codepre  pThe callback is pasted below with much edited out for simplicity. p  precodefunction cbFigResizesrc,evt  check if figure width is less than 600 if fpos3 lt 600      set min. width to 600     fpos3  600 end check if figure height is less than 560 if fpos4 lt560      set minimum height to 560     fpos4  560 end codepre  pMy coworker runs Windows XP and an earlier version of MATLAB.  I run Windows 7 and MATLAB 7.12.0.635.  Now when he resizes figures they always resize properly.  When I run the same code I can sometimes get the figure smaller than the above set minimum width and height limits.  My coworker says it is a Windows 7 interrupt problem.  If anybody else out there has this problem we found a simple but illogical workaround which I will post below.  p  precodefunction cbFigResizesrc,evt,doStop if nargin lt 3     doStop  false end   check if figure width is less than 600 if fpos3 lt 600      set min. width to 600     fpos3  600 end check if figure height is less than 560 if fpos4 lt560      set minimum height to 560     fpos4  560 end  if doStop     cbFigResizesrc,evt,true end codepre  pYou can see that this function calls itself with a flag that stops if from becoming an infinite loop.  And now I cannot resize windows below the minimum.  Has anybody any insights into this behaviorp

But accuracy isnt that important, just as long as it fires.p  pLike this article a hrefhttpwww.beansoftware.comASP.NETTutorialsScheduledTasks.aspx relnofollowScheduled Tasks in ASP.NETa, Ive come across several sites and stackoverflow answers that propose the use of timers, cache expiration techniques, or threads, for scheduling. But timers AND cache expirations arent firing for me in global.asax, and threading just causes the visual studio JIT debugger to be thrown up, but Im unable to catch any exceptions in any of the code the project was created as an http website in visual studio, not a web project  so no stepping through the debugger  just try catch  yay.p  pIve even tried Quartz.net, but cant get it to fire even once, plus its overkill given my simple needs.p  pAnyone successfully gotten scheduling to work in .Net in any capacityp

Negative 1141 pI am developing a facebook app and ran into the problem of secure browsing. Facebook can be set to secure browsing where all interaction with the website happens over HTTPS. To make the app usable in this case it is included via an iframe, we need to provide a secure URL ourselves. Since we currently cant buy a CA signed certificate, we needed to sign our own one. However, when the website is displayed in this iFrame, the security exception is not at all or not correctly displayed In Firefox the Add Exception button is not clickable and in Chrome we get a 501 error message. What is this And can this be solved somehowp  pPlease do not post comment about how unsecure selfsigned certificates are. I know that, and I would rather have a real one. This is just not an option at the moment, so signing our own is better than excluding secure browsing people totally from the app.p

Thanks in advance.p  pemEDITemOkay so I got it to work using your suggestions, but the problem now is that the script doesnt start until an image is initially moused over. All the pictures start full opacity until moused over then they all become .4 opacity.

Negative 1141 pCan anyone help me figure out why this page causes Android browsers to crashp  pa hrefhttpthewellcommunity.org relnofollowhttpthewellcommunity.orgap  pAll subpages seem to work just fine, but when I load the home page on an Android, the browser app just closes without any warning or error messages.  Ive tried this on 3 Android phones and on a Kindle Fire.p  pWhen I completely disable JavaScript in the browser on the phone, the page loads successfully.  Unfortunately this is a live website, so Id prefer to save disabling chunks of JavaScript on the server side as a last resort.p  pOn a side note, Opera Mini, Opera Mobile and Firefox on an Android phone do not crash, but Dolphin, Miren and the stock browser do.p  pUPDATE It appears that I spoke too soon when I said this was fixed. I was able to reduce how often the browser crashes, but it still does occasionally crash when the page is loaded. p  pUPDATE 2 It now appears that the crash may be CSS related. After spending weeks enabling and disabling various JavaScript snippits, I tried disabling the stylesheet, and now I cant get it to crash. p  pAnyone know of an Android CSS bug that might be causing this  My guess is that its related to some CSS that only gets accessed after the JavaScript does its work.p

Negative 1141 pI need to readwrite 16 bytes atomically. I do the writing only using cmpxchg16, which is available on all x64 processors except I think for one obscure AMD one.p  pNow the question is for aligned 16 byte values, only ever modified using cmpxchg16 which acts like a full memory barrier is it ever possible to read a 16 byte location thats half old data and half new datap  pAs long as I read with a SSE instruction so the thread cannot be interrupted in the middle of the read I think that its impossible even in multiprocessor numa systems for the read to see inconsistent data. I think it must be atomic.p  pI am making the assumption that when cmpxchg16 is executed, it modifies the 16 bytes atomically, not by writing two 8 byte blocks with the potential for other threads to do a read in between honestly I dont see how it could work if it wasnt atomic.p  pAm I right If Im wrong, is there a way to do an atomic 16 byte read without resorting to locking p  pNote There are a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7646018sseinstructionssinglememoryaccesscouple similar questions herea but they dont deal with the case where the writes are done only with cmpxchg16, so I feel this is a seperate, unanswered question.p  pstrongEditstrong Actually I think my reasoning was faulty. An SSE load instruction may be executed as two 64bit reads, and it may be possible for the cmpxchg16 to be executed in between the two reads by another processor.p

Negative 1141 pJava claims to be object oriented and typesafe, and Scala even more so.p  pInternal Class fields are represented by class called Field, which you can obtain a reference to via the Reflection API.p  pMy question do these languages provide any way to obtain that Field reference in a strongtypesafestrong way  And if not, why on earth not  Seems like a glaring deficiencyp  pIt would be extremely useful when mapping an Object to some external representation, for example to html fields in a template, or to column names in a database, to keep the reference names automatically in sync.  p  pIdeally Id like to say something likep  precodeampSomeClass.someField.name  codepre  pto get the name of the field declaration, similar to how java enums let you say p  precodeMyEnum.SOMEINSTANCE.name codepre  p[update] after reading feedback that this functionality would somehow violate the intent of the Reflection API, I agree that Reflection is designed for things that arent known at compile time, and thats exactly why its so absurd to have to use it to learn things that strongarestrong known at compile time, namely the Fields of the very class that its compilingp  pThe compiler provides this for enums, so if the compiler is able to access the enum Fields reference to allow MyEnum.SOMEINSTANCE.name, then theres no logical reason why it shouldnt also be able to provide this same functionality to ordinary Classes.p  pIs there any technological reason why this functionality couldnt be there for ordinary classes  I dont see why not, and I disagree that this functionality would complicate things... on the contrary it would vastly simplify the present cumbersome Reflection API techniques.  Why force developers into Reflection to find out something that is known at compile timep  p[update 2] as for the utility of this feature, have you ever tried using the Criteria API in JPA or Hibernate to dynamically construct a query  Have you seen the absurd workarounds people have come up with to try to avoid having to pass in an unsafe String representation of the field to query againstp

Negative 1141 pI am having a hard time even formulating the question I want to be answered, so heres my situationp  pIm trying to make a simple stock market plotter tool using an existing database I populate elsewhere.

Using easy to build scopes, I want something likep  precodestock  Stock.selectclosebytickeraapl,goog  codepre  pattributes arep  precodeaapl, goog, date codepre  pwhere aapl and goog contain the closing price data for just that ticker. I can run multiple database queries if I need to, for now I just want to be able to sort my data into this form. Also, it must be completely dynamic, so I cant hardcode codeaaplcode, codegoogcode and all the millions of other tickers into my model. p

Negative 1141 pI am working on an online recipe book, in which there are many recipes, ingredients, categories etc. I have to implement that the admin can add related recipes to objects of given entitiese.g. a category has many related recipes, which according to my clients wish should be added manually. Also, the related recipes have to have an order, which is also set manually. So I need one ManyToMany relationship between recipes and each of other entitiescategory, ingredient, recipe, etc., and additionally I have to store the position of each related recipe.p  pOne solution could be to set up a table for each entity having related recipes, and each row would contain an id for the entity, a recipe id and a position. This would mean I would have as many tables as many entities I have with relative recipes, which does not seem to be the best solution.p  pAnother solution could be to have 1 table containing all the information about related recipes, then each row would additionally contain the type of the other entity. Also I am really strict about the DRY principle so I would want to achieve this without writing repeated code and use Doctrine2Symfony2 to handle as much work as possible.p  pAnd if possible, the best would be if I had a piece of codesuch as a class which I can reuse and add the related recipes feature to new entites as well without writing or copypasting much code.p  pWhat could be the best classdatabase design for this I am highlighting, I am using Doctrine2  Symfony2 so please try to think in Doctrine.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1141 pI am currently in the process of refactoring an midsized software project. It contains a central kernellike class that is used by multiple threads. Currently, this class uses a codeGlibDispatchercode for handling signals that are emitted by multiple threads. Since one goal of the refactoring proccess is to get rid of codeglibmmcode entirely since codeQtcode shall be used as the new framework, I am trying to figure out a way of how to simulate the dispatcher functionality using codeBoostcode. I already looked into codeBoost.Signalscode and codeBoost.Signals2code, but neither one of these libraries seems to offer an alternative to the dispatcher.p  pTo clarify what the dispatcher shall do, heres a short description from a hrefhttpdeveloper.gnome.orgglibmmunstableclassGlib11Dispatcher.html relnofollowthe official documentationap  blockquote   pGlibDispatcher works similar to sigcsignal. But unlike   normal signals, the notification happens asynchronously through a   pipe. This is a simple and efficient way of communicating between   threads, and especially useful in a thread model with a single GUI   thread.p      pNo mutex locking is involved, apart from the operating systems   internal IO locking. That implies some usage rulesp      ul   liOnly one thread may connect to the signal and receive notification, but multiple   senders are allowed even without locking.li   liThe GLib main loop must run in the receiving thread this will be the GUI thread usually.li   liThe Dispatcher object must be instantiated by the receiver thread.li   liThe Dispatcher object should be instantiated before creating any of the   sender threads, if you want to avoid extra locking.li   liThe Dispatcher object must be deleted by the receiver thread.li   liAll Dispatcher objects instantiated by the same receiver thread must use the same main   context.li   ul blockquote  pCould you give me some pointers in the right direction Is this the sort of functionality I can achieve using codeBoost.Signalscode or codeBoost.Signals2codep  pEdit As a commenter rightly pointed out, using codeQtcode would perhaps be an option. However, the class that I am refactoring is very lowlevel and I do not want to add this additional dependency.p

Negative 1141 pIm currently working with a system that makes scheduling decisions based on a series of requests and the state of the system.p  pI would like to take the stream of real inputs, mock out some of the components, and run simulations against the rest.  The idea is to use it for planning with respect to system capacity i.e. when to scale certain components, tracking down certain failure modes, and analyzing the effects of changes to the codebase i.e. simulations with version A compared to simulations with version B.p  pI can do everything related to this, except generate a suitable input stream.  Replaying the exact input from production hasnt been very helpful because its hard to get a long enough data stream to tease out some of the behavior that Im trying to find.  In other words, if production falls over at 300 days of input, I dont have enough data to find out until after it fell over.  Repeating the same input set has been considered but after a few initial tries, the developers all agree that the simulation seems to need more random.p  pAbout this particular systemp  ul liThe input is a series of irregularly spaced events i.e. a stochastic process with discrete time and continuous state space.li liProperties are not a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStatisticallyindependent relnofollowindependenta of each other.li liEven the more independent of the properties are composites of other properties that will always be, by nature, invisible to me leading to a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMultimodaldistribution relnofollowmultimodal distributiona.li liRequest interval is not independent of other properties i.e. lots of requests for small amounts of resources come through in a batch, large requests dont.li liThere are feedback loops in it.li liIts provably chaotic.li ul  pSop  blockquote   pGiven a stream of input events with a certain distribution of various properties including interval, how do I generate an infinite stream of events with the same distribution across a number of nonindependent propertiesp blockquote  pHaving looked around, I think I need to do a MarkovChain MonteCarlo Simulation.

Am I just looking at this problem wrongp  precode Card             BudgetCard       Budget        BudgetAccount         Account                                      cardId    budgetIdltbudgetIdgtbudgetId         accountIdto Cardgt  accountId    gtcardId            limit          accountIdlt      typeId  etc                              typeId                             etc    typeId in Budget is either 1 for an account budget or 2 for a card budget. codepre  pAs you can see, its a circle.  What Im trying to accomplish is return one row with two columns  the sum of codeBudget.limitcode for the record in codeAccountcode where codetypeId  1code, and the sum of codeBudget.limitcode for all rows in codeCardcode belonging to codeAccountcodes of the same type.p  pAs per suggestion, I can in fact get the data I need from a union, but its no use to me if the data is not in two separate columnsp  precodeSELECT DISTINCTROW SumBudget.limit AS SumOfLimit FROM Account RIGHT JOIN Card ON Account.accountId  Card.accountId RIGHT JOIN Budget LEFT JOIN BudgetCard ON Budget.budgetID  BudgetCard.budgetId ON Card.cardId  BudgetCard.cardId GROUP BY Budget.typeId, Budget.quarterId, Account.typeId HAVING Budget.typeId2 AND Budget.quarterId[quarterId] AND Account.typeId[accountType]  UNION SELECT DISTINCTROW SumBudget.limit AS SumOfLimit FROM Budget LEFT JOIN Account RIGHT JOIN BudgetAccount ON Account.accountId  BudgetAccount.accountId ON Budget.budgetID  BudgetAccount.budgetId GROUP BY Budget.typeId, Budget.quarterId, Account.typeId HAVING Budget.typeId1 AND Budget.quarterId[quarterId] AND Account.typeId[accountType] codepre

Negative 1141 pI have a database with 600 tables and I am creating a unittestable data access layer using POCO, EF 4.1, Repository and unit of work patterns. This mean that I have 600 POCOs classes for entities, then for each entity class I have a repository class. I am using idea of aggregation from domain driven design which lead to creating bounded contexts that are specific to related sections in domain model. so far we have identified 40 bounded context. What I am confused about is how to model unit of work. Should there be one unit of work per respoistory or should it depend upon number of context that I have. I can always have one huge unit of work but then this may take away all advantages that I get by using smaller and targetted bounded contexts.p

Negative 1141 pAlright, so Im working on some code in my companies repo, and I stumbled across this bit of browser detection in the login checks. That pretty much searches for MSIE specifically, and wants to decline the login if the browser version is codelt 6code however. This is a rather flawed concept at the moment. Seeing as the method takes the user agent string and removes everything but the version number, however the version number in this case is a single digit which works great for version 19 detection. However with Internet explorer 10, the result is 1, thus breaking the logic and making it useless.p  pSo right now I am stuck trying to keep this logic for the most part the same, but in essence compensating for versions that would need 2 digits, such as 10p  pits been a long while since Ive done any browser detection thats version specific.

Negative 1141 pId like to sync between the internal Android calendar and my application. Im using CalendarContract available from Android API 14 onwards.p  pAny change of the content provider com.android.calendar calls onPerformSync.. of my sync adapter. However, at this point, all the rows of the events are set DIRTY  0. That means, the Google calendar sync must have set the DIRTY FLAG to zero before my sync adapter can access them.p  pCalendarContract.EventsColumns.SYNCDATA1  SYNCDATA10 are said to be columns of the content provider for use with sync adapters. Does anybody know if there is some convention for what is the use of these columns Ive realized that on my device SYNCDATA5 stores the date last modified and SYNCDATA1 seems to store the Google event ID. So it seems whenever the Calendar app syncs with Google Calendar, these columns are modified.p  pHowever, if I choose to use one of these columns for my sync adapter, how can I make sure another application doesnt use the very same columns and they override each otherp  pIf SYNCDATA5 is ALWAYS used by Google Calendar to store the date last modified I would be fine with just using that for my sync logic, I just need to be certain that this is a convention.p

Negative 1141 pSo, first off, this is an assignment for a friend that Im helping with, and while its been a while since Ive done C, thats not the problem Or at least I dont think it is, the problem is the assembly code. The assignment must use a function written in inline assembly to sum two numbers that have been passed to the function after having been input by the user, and return the value, which is then output. On running my code, I get errors either reading or writing to memory locations found in the asm function, specifically the second mov command, and the program will hang while attempting to execute that line of code. Tracing the program, one of the values will be stored correctly Whatever the second value the user enters, which I believe is normal, because values are read in reverse in assembly and the other isnt read at all, and the program crashes. Ive spent about four hours trying to figure this out, and am now resorting to outside help. Anyways, enough background, trying to be thorough, heres the code.

Negative 1141 pI have a pattern to process web service requests using chained partial functions this is a chain of responsibility pattern, I think.  In my example, lets say there are two parameters for the request, a string Id and a date.  Theres a verification step involving the id, a verification step checking the date, and finally some business logic that use both.  So I have them implemented like sop  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecodeobject Controller    val OK  200   val BADREQUEST  400    type ResponseGenerator  PartialFunction[String, DateTime, String, Int]    val errorIfInvalidIdResponseGenerator       case id,  if id  invalid gt Error, Invalid ID, BADREQUEST       val errorIfFutureDateResponseGenerator       case , date if date.isAfterDateTime.now gt Error, date in future, BADREQUEST       val businessLogicResponseGenerator       case id, date gt         ... do stuff       Success, OK            def handleRequestidString, dateDateTime       val chained  errorIfInvalidId orElse errorIfFutureDate orElse businessLogic     val result String, Int  chainedid, date       make some sort of a response out of the message and status code      e.g. in the Play framework...     Statusresult.2result.1     codepre  pI like this pattern because its very expressive  you can easily grasp what the controller method logic is just by looking at the chained functions. And, I can easily mix and match different verification steps for different requests.p  pThe problem is that as I try to expand this pattern it starts to break down.  Suppose my next controller takes an id I want to validate, but does not have the date parameter, and maybe it has some new parameter of a third type that does need validation. I dont want to keep expanding that tuple to codeString, DateTime, Othercode and have to pass in a dummy DateTime or Other. I want to have partial functions that accept different types of arguments they can still return the same type. But I cant figure out how to compose them.p  pFor a concrete question  suppose the example validator methods are changed to look like thisp  pre classlangscala prettyprintoverridecodeval errorIfInvalidIdPartialFunction[String, String, Int]     case id if id  invalid gt Error, Invalid ID, BADREQUEST   val errorIfInvalidDatePartialFunction[DateTime, String, Int]     case date if date.isAfterDateTime.now gt Error, date in future, BADREQUEST  codepre  pCan I still chain them together It seems like I should be able to map the tuples to them, but I cant figure out how.p
Negative 1141 pSorry for the broad question, but I didnt know quite how to word it. I am creating an app that manipulates the cameras pixels.

Then we try to get the rgb data out of the look up table to replace the cameras pixel with. This is where the problem occurs.

When we comment out the last line in the main loop,p  precodevec4 data  texture2DdataTexture, vec2floatx512.0, floaty512.0 codepre  pthe camera just displays like normal, because we dont do any manipulations on the actual FragColor.

This works fine when using a mouse. Question is, on a touch screen such as iPad or iPhone does removing your finger from the screen equate to mouseleave and if it does then how could you ever use your finger to tap a link inside the slidedown box Does this mean you always need to use a click to close a dropdown menu or other touch opened box on a touch devicep  pThanks.p

Negative 1141 pI am using the Pyramid web framework with SQLAlchemy, connected to a MySQL backend.  The app Ive put together works, but Im trying to add some polish by way of some enhanced logging and exception handling.  p  pI based everything off of the basic SQLAlchemy tutorial on the Pyramid site, using the session like sop  precodeDBSession  scopedsessionsessionmakerextensionZopeTransactionExtension codepre  pUsing DBSession to query works great, and if I need to add and commit something to the database Ill do something like p  precodeDBSession.addmyobject DBSession.flush codepre  pSo I get my new ID.p  pThen I wanted to add logging to the database, so I followed a hrefhttpdocs.pylonsproject.orgprojectspyramidcookbookenlatestloggingsqlalchemylogger.html relnofollowthis tutoriala. That seemed to work great.  I did initially run into some weirdness with things getting committed and I wasnt sure how SQLAlchemy was working so I had changed transaction.commit to DBSession.flush to force the logs to commit this is addressed below.p  pNext I wanted to add custom exception handling with the intent that I could put a friendly error page for anything that wasnt explicitly caught and still log things.  So based on a hrefhttpdocs.pylonsproject.orgprojectspyramidcookbookenlatestpylonsexceptions.html relnofollowthis documentationa I created error handlers like sop  precodefrom pyramid.view import      viewconfig,     forbiddenviewconfig,     notfoundviewconfig       from pyramid.httpexceptions import      HTTPFound,     HTTPNotFound,     HTTPForbidden,     HTTPBadRequest,     HTTPInternalServerError       from models import DBSession  import transaction import logging  log  logging.getLoggername  region Custom HTTP Errors and Exceptions viewconfigcontextHTTPNotFound, rendererHTTPNotFound.mako def notfoundrequest     log.exception404 not found 0.formatstrrequest.url     request.response.statusint  404     return   viewconfigcontextHTTPInternalServerError, rendererHTTPInternalServerError.mako def internalerrorrequest     log.exceptionHTTPInternalServerError 0.formatstrrequest.url     request.response.statusint  500     return   viewconfigcontextException, rendererHTTPExceptionCaught.mako def errorviewexc, request     log.exceptionHTTPException 0.formatstrrequest.url     log.exceptionexc.message      return  endregion codepre  pSo now my problem is, exceptions are caught and my custom exception view comes up as expected.  But the exceptions arent logged to the database.  It appears this is because the DBSession transaction is rolled back on any exception.  So I changed the logging handler back to transaction.commit.  This had the effect of actually committing my exception logs to the database, BUT now any DBSession action after any log statement throws an Instance not bound to a session error...which makes sense because from what I understand after a transaction.commit the session is cleared out.  The console log always shows exactly what I want logged, including the SQL statements to write the log info to the database.  But its not committing on exception unless I use transaction.commit, but if I do that then I kill any DBSession statements after the transaction.commit.p  pSooooo....how might I set things up so that I can log to the database, but also catch and successfully log exceptions to the database, too  I feel like I want the logging handler to use some sort of separate database sessionconnectioninstancesomething so that it is selfcontained but Im unclear on how that might work.  p  pOr should I architect what I want to do completely differentp  pEDIT I did end up going with a separate, logspecific session dedicated only to adding committing log info to the database. This seemed to work well until I started integrating a Pyramid console script into the mix, in which I ran into problems with sessions and database commits within the script not necessarily working like they do in the actual Pyramid web application.p  pIn hindsight and what Im doing now instead of logging to a database I use the standard logging and FileHandlers TimedRotatingFileHandlers specifically and log to the file system. p

Negative 1141 pTo give an overviewp  pI have an app built on Symfony1 but Im building the new parts with Symfony2. Ive moved the loginlogout actions on Symfony2 and made Symfony1 read the session data from Symfony2. By telling Symfony2 to write its session data in the default PHP SESSION, it works great, everything is there in arrays and Symfony1 can read the data and login my users automatically.p  pNow Im moving the Symfony1 and the Symfony2 apps on their own respective VMs. So instead of writing in PHP SESSION, I save the session in a MongoDB via the MongoDbSessionHandler. But now when I read the session data from the Symfony1 app, I end up with something like thisp  precodesf2attributesa0sf2flashesa0sf2metaa3s1ui1362655964s1ci1362655964s1ls10 codepre  pand it is definitely not unserializable. Symfony2 seems to serialize the data in its own way and I guess these sf2 stuff are the metadatabags. The thing is that strongI cannot find where this serialization is happeningstrong. To be able to unserialize it I need to find how it is serialized. The closest place Ive found is in the SessionHandlerProxyp  precodepublic function writeid, data      return bool thisgthandlergtwriteid, data  codepre  pthe data passed here contains the serialized data, but I cannot find in the code where it is called.p  pAny luckp

Negative 1141 pwell Ive stumbled upon similar cases of this problem, and also followed the solution approaches. But my case is quite strange, as I have 2 different DetailsViewcontrols with different data, one works, the other doesnt.p  pSo heres the problem in detail. I get the following error messagep  precodeDropDownList2 has a SelectedValue which is invalid because it does not exist in the list of items. Parameter name value codepre  pI am aware of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5886179aspnetwebformsdropdownlisthasaselectedvaluewhichisinvalidbecauseitdthis threada, and maybe Im stupid and not seeing something. But maybe you do. I have 2 Detailsviews, which bind their data based on a dataset for one user. Both DVs have DropdownListControls inside their EditItemTemplates, which bind the possible values for this very column. I use SelectedValuelt Bindmycolumn  for my DropDownListtemplate exactly the same way in the 2 DVs.p  pAs said, I am aware of codebehind workarounds, but I want to avoid those, to keep my code clean and consistent. I cant really document why I use a workaround on one DetailsView, and why I dont on the other.p  pHere is the code of my 2 DetailsViewsp  precodeltaspDetailsView IDdvthemeava runatserver Height50px

For comparison I used the 2 fields theme and type. Both tables only have 1 column in my database, holding string entries.p  pNow, the typeDDL gets its items perfectly fine, and has the SelectedValue bound to the value brought to the DetailsView by the datasource. When I bind the themeDDL with SelectedValue, I get the error. Interesting in the same EditItemTemplate I have set up a Label ID lolbel2 p to check the databinding. It works of course, when I remove the SelectedValue from the DDL. So without the SelectedValue in the DDL my output is like [DROPDOWNLIST] with items space, magic [LABEL] with text magic since this is the value of my testuser.p  pAm I missing something Am I completely nuts So, sorry for reasking this question for like the 10thtime, but I want to UNDERSTAND what my code does.p  pThanks in advance Konradp

Negative 1141 pIn my application I am using DefaultDataTable with SortableDataProvider which has LoadableDetachableModel as the model. p  pI used it to display a set of records  say strongRecordListstrong page. When I add or remove some records and load the page  strongRecordListstrong again, it displays the changes. However, if I use the back button of the browser and go the  strongRecordListstrong page which was rentered earlier  before adding removing the records . The DefaultDataTable still has the old sets of records. This is a big issue when records are deleted. p  pFor example, If I delete a record and press back button then the page fails as the record it is trying to show does not exist in the database.  Adding does not create an issue because it simply does not get listed in the set of records. p  pIn another page, I just have PageableListView with LoadableDetachableModel. It works fine with out an issue. p

Negative 1141 pIm trying to figure out if it is possible to use ServiceStack Razor for oldfashioned serverside form validation.p  pBy way of example a GET to a url returns a razor template with a form.

If, on the other hand the request DTO is valid, the service will redirect the user to another page.p  pIs that scenario possiblep  pIf so, how would one go about implementing it I presume Ill have to write certain filters or features for this to work, however Im wondering what strategy will require minimum amount of coding.p  pI understand javascript validation is possible, however my question is specifically whether it is possible to roundtrip the form with serverside validation.p

Negative 1141 pThis is mostly for Py2app, but I plan to also port to Windows so Py2exe is also applicable.p  pFor Mac How can I access the Resources folder of my app bundle from Python code The ideal way for me would be to get the path to this folder into a variable that my classes prepend to any file they need to access. Given the portable nature of OSX app bundles this Resources folder can move, so its obviously not acceptable to assume itll always be at ApplicationsMyApp.appContentsResources. p  pFor development I can preset this variable to something like .Resourcestest but for the final distribution I would need to be able to locate the Resources folder to access files therein as file objects.p  pFor Windows If I use py2exe, whats the correct way to get the path to where the application is running from Think portable app  the app might be running from Program files, or a directory on someones flash drive, or in a temp directory On Windows itd be suitable to simply know where the .exe file is and just have a Resources folder there.

Negative 1141 pstrongContextstrong I have a system that acts as a Web UI for a legacy accounting system. This legacy system sends me a large text file, several times a day, so I can update a CONTRACT table in my database the file can have new contracts, or just updated values for existing contracts. This table currently has around 2M rows and about 150 columns. I cant have downtime during these updates, since they happen during the day and theres usually about 40 logged users in any given time.p  pMy systems users cant update the CONTRACT table, but they can insert records in tables that reference the CONTRACT table Foreign Keys to the CONTRACT tables ID column.p  pTo update my CONTRACT table I first load the text file into a staging table, using a bulk insert, and then I use a MERGE statement to create or update the rows, in batches of 100k records. And heres my problem  during the MERGE statement, because Im using READ COMMITED SNAPSHOT isolation, the users can keep viewing the data, but they cant insert anything  the transactions will timeout because the CONTRACT table is locked.p  pstrongQuestionstrong does anyone know of a way to quickly update this large amount of rows, while enforcing data integrity and without blocking inserts on referencing tables p  pIve thought about a few workarounds, but Im hoping theres a better wayp  ol liDrop the foreign keys.  Id like to enforce my data consistency, so this dont sound like a good solution.li liDecrease the batch size on the MERGE statement so that the transaction is fast enough not to cause timeouts on other transactions.  I have tried this, but the sync process becomes too slow Has I mentioned above, I receive the update files frequently and its vital that the updated data is available shortly after.li liCreate an intermediate table, with a single CONTRACTID column and have other tables reference that table, instead of the CONTRACT table. This would allow me to update it much faster while keeping a decent integrity.  I guess it would work, but it sounds convoluted.li ol  pstrongUpdatestrong I ended up dropping my foreign keys. Since the system has been in production for some time and the logs dont ever show foreign key constraint violations, Im pretty sure no inconsistent data will be created.

Negative 1141 pThis is driving me crazy.

Negative 1141 pIm trying to do exactly what a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4357440snakegamefollowingsegmentsnongridbasedthis guy is doinga but I emthinkem he may have less requirements than me because the answers in that post dont seem like theyd work for my game.  Let me inline his algorithm so my question is easier to understandp  blockquote   pThe easiest solution is to loop from tail to head and set the position of the current to the next segments position, ie codesegment[i].position  segment[i  1].positioncodep blockquote  pI think the strongkey differencestrong between our requirements is I want to move each piece less than its own widthheight on every tick.  For examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY3LGC.png altenter image description herep  pPretend these squares are aligned horizontally I drew it unaligned because I think it makes it easier to see whats going on.  The red codeHcode is where the head currently is.  The red codeTcode is where the tail currently is.  The black codeHcode is where the head should be next tick.  So the snake is moving right to left.  If I use the algorithm described above, wont the segments overlap or start driving apart  Let me play it out step by stepp  ol liCreate H.positionli liT.position  H.positionli liH.position  H.positionli ol  pThe result of this would becomep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPMGGI.png altenter image description herep  pWhat algorithm can I use to make sure that all the pieces move at the same speed and stay the same distance apart from each other  p  hr  pIll give my idea, but Im skeptical of it because my research doesnt show anyone else using thisp  pEach segment will store its coordinates and its direction.  EG code[[50, 50, LEFT], [100, 50, LEFT]]code.  The head is index 0, the tail is index 1.  strongThe speed at which the snake moves is 10, even though the segments are 50x50strong.  p  pEach tick Ill do thisp  ol liIf the mouse was pressed, overwrite the codenextDirectioncode variable with the direction that was pressed.  Otherwise, codenextDirectioncode is whatever it was last tick.  In this example, lets assume someone pressed codeUPcode.li liIterate the array and apply the direction to each tick.  EG code[[40, 50, LEFT], [90, 50, LEFT]]codeli liShift the directions from head to tail and set the heads new direction to codenextDirecitoncode.  EG code[[40, 50, UP], [90, 50, LEFT]]codeli liRepeat every tick.li ol  pDoes this algorithm seem like it would work  Part of the reason Im asking is because its more complicated than the other guys algorithm so I feel like Im doing something wrong.  And also, the more I think about his algorithm, the less it seems like it can work.  p  hr  h1Rewording My Problemh1  pPretend each segment of the snake is a 20x20 pixel rectangle.  Each emtickem, I want the head to move 5 pixels in some direction.  strongHow do I make sure all the segments stay touching each otherstrongp  pRafes description below in a comment is p  blockquote   pConsider the ordered set of locations occupied by the snake at step codetcode, with the leftmost being the tail and the rightmost being the head codeA, B, C, D, Ecode. At step codet1code, the ordered set of locations occupied by the snake is codeB, C, D, E, Fcode where the tail has moved from codeAcode to codeBcode and the head has moved from codeEcode to codeFcode.p blockquote  pAnd I dont think this algorithm works becausep  blockquote   blockquote     pYes but if the width of codeA  B  C  D  E  F  20pxcode.

Why is this behavior If there is a loss of precision as the number 0.1f not being represented precisley in binary representation and adding it time and again is causing the summation to be lesser than 1.0f The same should be true for the next loop right How far can we trust the floating point arthimaticp

Negative 1141 pOk, so Ive made a timer that makes parts of my SVG map fadeOut as they cross certain thresholds. However, I want to mess with other parts of the CSS.p  pI looked at this post, but couldnt make sense of it in terms of my problem.p  p Edits Below p  pThanks for the help, I took a look at my code and tried to clean out some of the stuff that didnt need to be there. I also restructured my if statement, putting it inside of the JQuery code. I tried the suggestion below, assigning the var timer outside the interval function, but then my start button no longer worked and the script started running on page load. So, I moved it back to keep things working.  Also, put my code into JSFiddle, but I couldnt get it to work correctly. Will spend some more time familiarizing myself with that in the meantime. Thank you for introducing me to that. p  pAs for my original question  the .animate tag works so long as I set it to change the opacity attribute, but has no effect on the other attributes I want to change. I know SVG and CSS have different attribute names, and Ive tried both types of names. Here is my code below. I am trying to get the .animate effect to change the fill color and strokewidth. p  precodevar i,timer i  2013  function start  timer  self.setIntervalincrement, 800    function increment  i document.getElementByIdtimerout.innerHTML   i  document.ready function      if i  2014          AL.animate              opacity 0.3  , 500          function stop  clearIntervaltimer timer  null    function reset  stop i2013 document.getElementByIdtimerout.innerHTML  i  codepre  pIm really just concerned with the JQuery statement, which works perfectly fine until I replace opacity with a different CSS attribute. p  pThanks again for the attention and advice.p

Negative 1141 pI currently store a number of document preview images jpgtif outside of my web root. There are 100s of them, so having this work efficiently is important. The reason they are stored outside of the web root is that they contain data the only specific usersuser groups may view but each user can have 100s of documents they can view.p  pMy current implementation is, when the user selects view image an ajax call is triggered and this moves the image in question to a specific folder within the web root. The location is passed back and used to display the image to the user. When the next image is clicked, the call deletes any existing images and copies over the requested image.  At session logout  timeout the users image folder is emptied. This has a few problems, but mainlyp  ol liFiles are constantly being copied and deletedli liThere is the risk of images being left in the folder issues with log off scriptsli liThe whole time an images is in the folder it could be viewed by another users unlikely but possibleli ol  pIs there a better way of doing this I looked at trying to combine the BinaryReader with the ajax call as I hoped this would cut out the need to copy the files, but cant see how to get the data back to be used by the JS in the calling page.p  pAlternatively is there a way of making selected Folders only accessible to given users based on some session criteria I cant imagine there is but I thought its worth asking.p  pSo if anyone has any ideas on how this can be improved that would be great. This is a c ASP.NET app using Jquery.p  pEdit The image is displayed using ajax, this allows for preloading and also means the rest of the page does not need to be reloaded when they select the nextprevious image. It can almost be thought of as a javascript image swapper type situation, where the images are stored outside of the web root.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1141 pI am updating a client site and the simple contact form that used to work is now broken. It appears that the HTML form sends and receives data from the jQuery file as I get the error messages returned, though it is not passing the data through to the PHP file for sending an email. If I send the data direct from the HTML form to the PHP file, then an email is sent. The error is probably at the end of the jQuery, though my search for how to fix has not revealed an answer.

K is the given value I am trying to find. Key is the value the loop finds in each spot as it moves down the table.

Ive one more query in code there are two arrays regdata[30][65535] and bitarray[30][2000] after reading data from a file I can decide the first dimension of array i.e. [30]..if data in file is for two slave id then i require regdata[2][65535] and bitarray[2][2000]..how I can manage this assignment at runtime I tried using vector like codestruct                                                                      regdata[65535]                    bitarray[2000]                                                    regstack                                                            after reading file Icode tried to pushback regstack, but it gives heap error..how I can resize this array in runtimep

Negative 1141 pI have the intuition that a circular list can be simulated by a proper list with an end marker in combination with a loop through the whole list over and over.  My feeling is that circular lists are cleaner since the control logic loop is built into the structure.  On the other hand, taking the control logic apart from the structure seems a separation of concern, which may be favored in some situation.  What I am not quite sure is in what situation is each useful.  Also I am not quite sure whether the simulation is always possible.  If not, could you please give a counterexamplep

Negative 1141 pAssume you are given a set emAem  1, 2, ..., emmem and a set emBem  1, 2, ..., emnem, such that beach element from the set emAem has to be assigned to some element from emBemb. The following parameters for each element emiem from the set emAem and each element emjem from the set emBem are knownp  ul liemSsubijsubem is the cost of assignment an element emiem to element emjem greater or equal to zeroli liemtsubijsubem is the minimal preference of element emiem to element emjem  greater or equal to zeroli liemTsubijsubem is the maximal preference of element emiem to element emjem  greater or equal to zero.li ul  pFor each fixed emiem, all values of emtsubijsubem, emTsubijsubem for all emjems are different. emmem and emnem are integers greater than 0, and the other variables are nonnegative real numbers.p  pElements from the set emAem are assigned to elements from emBem according to their preferences emtsubijsubem or emTsubijsubem. For example, if emtsubijsubem lt emtsubiksubem preferences emTsubijsubem or emTsubiksubem might be used in any case instead, read further, then element emiem will be assigned to emjem rather then emkem. Out of emmnem preferences, exactly emrem of them have to use value of emTsubijsubem as a value of preference, and remaining emmn  rem have to use value of emtsubijsubem which is lower value then emTsubijsubem.p  pIf element emiem is assigned to an element emjem, then the cost emSsubijsubem is added to the total cost of assignment to element emjem, i.e., emCsubjsubem  emCsubjsubem  emSsubijsubem. Let emMaxem be the maximum among all costs emCsubjsubem and emMinem the minimum among all costs emCsubjsubem. The goal is to choose which preferences of assignment element emiem to element emjem will take the value of emTsubijsubem, and which preferences will take the value of emtsubijsubem, such that the value ofp  ol liemMaxem is minimalli liemMax  Minem is minimal.li ol  pI think there is some dynamic programming algorithm, but Im not sure. Does anybody know how to solve this by DP approach, or any other It might not be polynomial, however, but I think it is.p  pbExample.b Let emmem  3, emnem  2, i.e. emAem  1, 2, 3 and emBem  1, 2, 3.

Similar example might be constructed for minimizing emMaxem  emMinem.p
Negative 1141 pIm fairly new to PowerShell and Im posting this on many forums but Ive had success with programming assistance from here before and although this isnt strictly programming, I was hoping someone might know the answer.p  pMy organization had about 5,300 users we needed to disable for a client. Someone decided the best use of our time was have people go through AD and disable them one at a time. Soon as I got wind of this I put a stop to it and used PowerShell to take the CSV list we already had, and ran a cmdlet to disable all of the users in the CSV list.p  pThis appeared to work, but I wanted to run a comparison. I want to compare the users from the CSV file, to the users in AD, and confirm that they are all disabled without having to check all 5300 individually. We checked about 60 random ones to verify my run worked, but I want to make sure none slipped through the cracks.p  pIve tried a couple scripts and Ive tried some variations of cmdlets. None of the scripts I tried even worked, spammed with errors. When I try to run a search of AD either using getcontent or importCSV from the csv file, when I export its giving me about 7600 disabled users if I search by disabled. There were only 5300 users in total, so it must be giving me all of the disabled users in AD. Other cmdlets ive run appear to do the same thing, its exporting an entire AD list instead of just comparing against my CSV file.p  pAny assistance anyone can provide would be helpful.p

Therefore, Im trying to write thisp  precode  describe GET index do     it should set somevar do       someservice.stubstatus.andreturnaloha       get index       assignssomevar.should  aloha     end   end codepre  pAs some of you might have guessed already, this gives mep  precodeexpected aloha got nil using  codepre  pI think Im not stubbing the service correctly. Could some one please help  Thanks.p

In the explanations of other approaches, dropping the branch after the action is implied by the structure of the responses. but nothing is explicitly stated about it.p  poneliner I have a fix that needs to get into production before the topic branch will be done the same fix needs to also be in the branch for the work there to be viable. p  pThis would applies to cases where production and test or whatever branches coexist for long periods, as well.p

Negative 1141 pI have a MVC structured web application. I have both codeapplicationcode, codesessioncode, and coderequestcode scoped data, And I use a custom made Request Based MVC framework, similar to the ones in Spring and Struts. I have used a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3541077designpatternswebbasedapplicationsthis questions answera as a tutorial.p  pI have a java object called codeShowModelcode, which is passed as session scoped data. I use this to keep track of the users selection of visible components on the webpages.p  pAll of the possible visibility selections are represented by a checkbox. They are all set to default of visiblechecked when first setting the session data.p  pI have a listener on all of the checkboxes, that registers change, by class name toggle, and sends its id and codecheckedcodecodeuncheckedcode status by ajax to the serverservlet. See code example 1. I want to state that my experience with ajax is very limited.p  pAs all of my calls are intercepted by my Front Controller Servlet, I needed to make a corresponding action, to execute the ajax codePOSTcoderequest.

The problem Im running into is that I am using the changepoint cp in my looping structure, and I am getting an error Cannot evaluate upper index of counter i. I am guessing that I cannot loop using a variable I also want to estimate Im wondering if anyone has done this andor has a suggestion on how to do this.

Negative 1141 pI am writing a code in which I am drawing two rectangles as obstacles and an oval as the robot. The robot moves while obstacles are stationary. The problem is as the robots location is generated randomly in the beginning, it sometimes overlap the rectangles. I am trying continuously to fix this, but I am not able to find a good solution.p  pI tried checking the bounds of the rectangle with the x,y coordinate of circle before drawing it. But, it only checks for that single point and sometimes some other point of circle overlaps the rectangle. I tried intersect method but I am not able to implement that in my code as I am using fillOval and fillRect.p  pstrongI know this question is already asked in the community multiple times. But, all answers revolve around the intersect method in AWT. I am not using the RectangleEllipse classes. I am using fillRect and fillOval to create my shapes.

Negative 1141 pI am having a problem with a code that I created. I have two classes that use the same code. The only thing I changed was the name of the class and the activity. For example  p  precode Class          Activity   A.java           A.xml   B.java           B.xml codepre  pI copied and pasted both class and activity. p  pThe problem I am experiencing is that codeA.javacode works but codeB.javacode does not. codeA.javacode uses a database and populates a codeListviewcode when is called. If a user wants to search it will display the results accordingly to the criteria.  codeB.javacode should do the same, but the problem is that it doesnt search. It returns 0 results from the database. Like I said, it uses the same code. I have not change anything from codeAcode to codeBcode. I dont understand why codeBcode is not working while codeAcode is. The only good thing is that codeBcode populates the codeListviewcode when it is called but not when it searches.p

Negative 1141 pso I have kind of a unique website, where I have a gallery where users can click on the image and then see more photos of what they clicked on, specifications, and a little info blurb. However, I am coding it on my 11inch laptop, but when I checked it out on my 1440p screen it looked terrible, so I fixed that with media queries, but I am not sure if that is the best way to get it to look right on all screen sizes.

Six total navigation states as each tab starts with a Search Form page which leads to a Search Results page on submit and then a View page emonmousedownem click action of an individual result for each of Person amp Address data. The Search Form pages are sessionscoped, and designed to pass search parameters around to each other in a header box entitled Users Search Query. It does this because the Search Results page for Address searches is really an overloaded Person search result with Address thrown in for Search for People by Address.

And I need to find out if codeltltltcode appears in the buffer.p  pIm using C11 VS2013 and coming from a .NET background the problem wouldnt be that hard create an codeEncodingcode object instance for the encoding, then pass it the data as codeByte[]code and convert it to a codeStringcode instance internally using UTF16LE, and use the string functions codeIndexOfcode or a codeRegexcode.p  pHowever the C equivalent doesnt necessarily work as Microsofts C runtime library, specifically its implementation of codelocalecode, does not support UTF8 multibyte encoding a complete mystery to me.

Negative 1141 pI am using an codeNSURLConnectioncode to connect to a server with a wildcard TLS certificate like .domain.com, and when I call codeSecTrustEvaluatecode in my codeNSURLConnectionDelegatecodes codeconnectionwillSendRequestForAuthenticationChallengecode method, the certificate is rejected as invalid. Another server that has a fullyspecified TLS certificate like server2.domain.com is accepted. Both certificates are issued by the same CA, and I have added the CA certificate to my devices trusted certificate list.p  pI am seeing the same behavior from Safari on my iPhone  iOS 8.1. The server with the wildcard certificate is reported as having an untrusted certificate, while the other server works fine. So it looks like iOSs default certificate verification rejects wildcard certificates. Is this the casep  pIs there a way to tell codeSecEvaluateTrustcode to allow wildcard certificates Heres an excerpt from my codeconnectionwillSendRequestForAuthenticationChallengecodep  precode voidconnectionNSURLConnection connection     willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallengeNSURLAuthenticationChallenge challenge    if [challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod          isEqualToStringNSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust]      SecTrustRef trust  [challenge.protectionSpace serverTrust]     SecTrustResultType trustResult     OSStatus status  SecTrustEvaluatetrust, amptrustResult     if status  noErr        if trustResult  kSecTrustResultProceed            trustResult  kSecTrustResultUnspecified           Success. server2 gets here        else           Server authentication failure. server1 gets here                 codepre  pstrongEDITstrong The Android version of our software accepts the wildcard certificates just fine, so I suspect there is something specific to iOSs certificate handling that is going on here. The Android client is using a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceorgapachehttpconnsslBrowserCompatHostnameVerifier.html relnofollowcodeBrowserCompatHostnameVerifiercodea to verify the certificate, which as far as I understand performs the same function as codeSecPolicyCreateSSLcode  performing the same checking on the certificate that a browser does.p

Negative 1141 pIve made a global scope and a trait that applies it as per the L4 docs.  The scope gets applied in the boot function of the trait.p  pWhen I use the initial model to run queries the scope gets applied OK, but if I make a new model the scope is not added to the queries on that model.  e.g.p  precodecustomer  new Customer customergtget         scope applied here  customer2  new Customer customer2gtget         scope NOT applied here codepre  pIve changed the code so that in the model constructor I call a function on the trait which adds the scope for each model, e.gp  precodeClass Customer extends Eloquent       use UserRestrictionTrait      construct            thisgtaddUserRestrictionScope        codepre  pThis means that  staticaddGlobalScopenew UserRestrictionScope is being called once per model instance rather than just once in the boot function of the trait.p  pSeems to be working OK, just wondering if this is the right thing to do or if I misinterpreted the conceptp  pThanks.p

The exercise involves creating a codeRobotcode data type which is capable of storing a name, which is randomly generated exercise codeReadmecode is included below.  p  pFor those who arent familiar with it, the codeexercism.iocode learning model is based on automated testing of studentgenerated code.  Each exercise consists of a series of tests written by the test author and the solution code must be able to pass all of them.  Our code must pass all tests in a given exercises test file, before we can move to the next exercise  an effective model, imo. codeRobot Namecode is exercise 20 or so.p  pIn this particular exercise, were asked to create a codeRobotcode datatype and three accompanying functions codemkRobotcode, coderobotNamecode and coderesetNamecode.p  ul licodemkRobotcode generates an instance of a codeRobotcode li licoderobotNamecode generates and returns a unique name for a unnamed codeRobotcode i.e., coderobotNamecode does not overwrite a preexisting name if a codeRobotcode already has a name, it simply returns the existing nameli licoderesetNamecode overwrites a preexisting name with a new one.li ul  pIn this particular exercise, there are 7 tests.  The tests checks thatp  ul li0 coderobotNamecode generates names that conforms to the specified pattern a name is 5 characters long and is made up of two letters followed by three digits, e.g., AB123, XQ915, etc.li li1 a name assigned by coderobotNamecode is persistent i.e., lets say we create robot A and assign him or her a name using coderobotNamecode calling coderobotNamecode a second time on robot A shouldnt overwrite his nameli li2 coderobotNamecode generates unique names for different robots i.e., it tests that were actually randomizing the processli li3 coderesetNamecode generates names that conform to the specified pattern similar to test 0li li4 a name assigned by coderesetNamecode is persistentli li5 coderesetNamecode assigns a different name i.e., coderesetNamecode gives a robot a name thats different form its current nameli li6 coderesetNamecode affects only one robot at a time i.e., lets say we have robot A and robot B resetting robot As name shouldnt affect robot Bs name AND ii names that are generated by coderesetNamecode are persistentli ul  pAs reference, heres the test itself a hrefhttpsgithub.comdchaudhexercismhaskellsolutionsblobmasterrobotnamerobotnametest.hs relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdchaudhexercismhaskellsolutionsblobmasterrobotnamerobotnametest.hsap  hr  pstrongemWhere Im stuckemstrongp  pemVersion 1 original postem sAt the moment, my code fails on three tests 1, 4 and 6 all of which have to do with persistence of a robots name.s.p  pemVersion 2 interimem sNow my code fails on one test 5 only  test 5 has to do with changing the name of  a robot that weve already createds  thanks to bheklikr for his helpful comments which helped me clean up version 1p  pemVersion 3 finalem The code is now fixed and passes all tests thanks to Cirdecs thorough post below.

Negative 1141 pI created an algorithm that calculates certain things. This can be considered as the model. The algorithm is implemented in a fully functional way, so it uses immutable classes only. Now using this model, I would like to develop a GUI layer on the top of it. However I do not know anything about the bestpractises of building GUI in Scala. I intend to use ScalaFX.p  pMy problem is the following in ScalaFX similarly to JavaFX you can bind values from the GUI to object properties. This clearly violates the functional paradigm, but seems very convenient. This would require rewriting my classes to use bindable properties which would feel like the tail wagging the dog  the model would depend on the GUI.p  pOn the other hand, I could have an independent GUI layer. In this case I would need proxy objects to bind to and I would have to create my model objects based on these proxy objects. This would feel more idiomatic but implies a lot of code duplication and extra work. My model and the proxy objects would have to be kept in sync and I would have to take care of copying the attributes.p  pWhat is a good way of doing this A GUI is always full of mutability so functional programming does not feel right here. Nevertheless I love Scala so I would like to keep using it for the GUI, too.p

Negative 1141 pI updated a few libraries and code and published an update to our production environment. There was a JavaScript error which only occurred in production environment and not in our dev and test environments.p  pAfter going through every possibility, I discovered that if I change strongcompilation debugfalsestrong to strongdebugtruestrong in web.config then everything works in all environments.p  pLikewise, when I changed the setting from strongtruestrong to strongfalsestrong in any environment, the controls doesnt work. Ive restarted IIS on all servers and even rebooted the test environment web server, but the scripts still doesnt load when debug is set to false in any environment.p  pI believe the WebResources.AXD call is being cached, so Ive cleared my browser cache multiple times and set my Chrome dev tools to disable caching. However, even after a test env server reboot, the script fails to be properly loaded when debug is set to true. p  pIt continues to work fine in all environments when debug is set to true and continues to fail in all environments when debug is set to false. For the time being, I reverted my production environment, so Im just trying to get it to work in the dev amp test environment with debuggingtrue, before trying to publish it to production again.p  pUsing MS IIS 6, ASP.NET 4x, Win 2003R2 serversp  pThanks,p
Negative 1141 pI am trying to export a scikit learn multinomial naive bayes model into the PMML format.  Based on my understanding of the PMML format, for each feature xi and class yj I need the count[xi,yj] which is the number of times feature xi occurred in class yj.  I was under the impression that featurecount attribute would give me that number but when I run it for a particular feature I seem to be getting decimal numbers, which does not make sense to me.  Here is the output below where I am printing out the featurescount for xi where i200000 and I have j30 classes.  I did not use any prior sample weighting which is what confuses me about this output.

List a is a list of real objects and assigned number to them. If the same drawing and object repeat in database its ok. The problem is when two drawings are assigned to one object. In my case if items in the same location in two list repeat its not a problem. 3c is just a repetition not causing problems. 3c can be ignored from my study. 3c would be a situation in which we have two identical object and two identical drawings so no conflict. 2 is a number assigned to real object and a is a letter for drawing. Problem is when there is one real object and two different drawing assigned to the same object. It cause mistakes in production of parts. 2, a, 2, b, is a problem.p

Negative 1141 pI have an intranet site that has to perform complex and lengthy MySQL operations, and I have to find a way to prevent a PHP Session timeout from happening while this is going on.p  pA PHP page has all the form data that the user can fill out. When the user hits the submit button, an Ajax call goes out with that data, and the Ajax call waits until the operation is completed and then notifies the user of the result. I have to prevent the site from timing out while this call is going on.p  pMy first thought was to use codesetIntervalcode and run a second ajax call every 10 seconds to a page that only loads the session and refreshes some of the data in it, but during a first test I noticed that the second call and any further calls were not answered until the first one completed I used PHP codesleep20code in my first call to simulate a long wait. My script started several new ajax calls which I watched in Firebug, but they all waited until the first call was completed  there was no response from the server until then. I think the server simply ignores a second call from the same client until the first is done. I doubt Apache would stop accepting calls because PHP is waiting for codesleepcode to finish...p  pDuring my research on this I havent really found out yet what event is used to consider a Session timeout. One page claimed that just using Ajax to load a picture would extend the Session time, but that doesnt sound right to me since that doesnt involve PHP  besides, if the server doesnt accept a second connection, that wont work. Another page said it has to do with whenever the Session variable data is being written do, but again that also doesnt match my experience since I have plenty of pages that write during login but not after that.p  pSo my question is twofoldp  ol lipWhich exact events have to happen or not happen within a given timeout period for the Session to be considered timed out I am guessing there are two timers involved here  the cookie timeout in the browser and  the Session timeout in PHP, but these are just guesses, and Id like to hear from the experts on this.pli lipHow can I keep that Session alive while the process is still going on The process may take an hour or longer. The site is an intranet site and not accessible from outside the network, so security is not quite as big an issue, but I still want the regular Session timeout to work outside of this page.pli ol  hr  pOK, I feel the need to clarify here.p  pI am trying to find out what happens behind the scenes on the server whenever a PHP session timeout is involved.p  pFor example If I have a script that takes 1h to create a PDF file but the timeout is set to 30 minutes, will the timeout be triggered because the userbrowsermouse is not active, or will the timeout NOT be triggered because a script is still runningp  pWhat I would like to know is what EXACTLY is going on  what events take place both user and server created in prolonging a session before it times outp  pYou can tell me about PHP settings all day, and I still wont know what happens.p  pLets start with the basics as far as I understand themp  pA typical session may consist out of a session file on the server, a session id, and often a cookie in the client browser that holds the session id and a timestamp.p  pIm assuming that the session file on the server or some index of session files also includes a timestamp.p  pWhich events cause these timestamps to be updated, and which of these timestamps is being used to determine that the session has timed out or not I could see the server testing the cookies expiration date to determine if the session should timeout or not, but its probably safer to rely on the server information.p  pThis is the type of information Im looking for here.p  pMaybe I should close the original question and write a new one with this information  Im open to suggestions here. When I wrote the original post, I just needed an answer for my project, but I realized that I will never fully understand the process until I know the workings in the background.p

Negative 1141 pI have a large over a  million characters text file of this shapep  precodeabc 2 nmb 3 sds 5 abc 6 codepre  pAs you see, each line has two elements. The pairs on each line are not unique, meaning abc could map to 2 and 3 and probably many more. I need to store this into a suitable data structure that I could save to a file. Later I would like to see for example how many times a string has showed up and how many times it has been mapped to a certain number. I need to be able to do this relatively quickly, otherwise I could just use the file asis. p  pI first tried to create a dictionary and store the data using the codejsoncode library, which was pretty easy and straightforward to do. But then I realized I can not use that because the keyvalue pairs are not unique and a key can be mapped to several values and the data structure should preserve that. p  pSo given the largeness of the file and the way I want to use it, what is a good way to do thisp
Negative 1141 pI have a web application with a websocket connection, and I cannot seem to get the connection to work. It keeps giving me the error access denied java.util.PropertyPermission org.glassfish.tyrus.client.sharedContainer read on the client side log, ad on the server side I get Warning   StandardWrapperValve[default] Servlet.service for servlet default threw exception java.io.IOException Connection reset by peerp  pIm not sure whether this is because of a problem with my code, or with the libraries and classes I used to support that code. When I change the clients target address, it gives the same error but I dont get any errors on the server end. Im not sure if this is because Ive incorrectly configured the connection protocol, and so its hitting the server app but not the websocket port, or if its because of the combination of technologies Im using for the server and the client. Im trying to use the plain JSR 356 for both, but that doesnt quite work for the client. I found out somewhere that the JSR client isnt properly done, but that its supposed to work if you include the Tyrus stand alone libraries in your project, even if you dont actually change your code to use any classes from them. If I leave out the Tyrus library, then I get Could not find an implementation class from my client instead. You can view the source code for my client a hrefhttpgithub.comAgoraProjectJAgoraLib relnofollowherea and for my server a hrefhttpgithub.comAgoraProjectJAgoraWebSocketServer relnofollowherea. Ive gotten the same errors on the client side both when using netbeans with glassfish, and also when deployed to a remote tomcat server. For the browser, Ive been using Firefox under an Xubuntu operating system.p  pSo is this a problem of me just not getting the two aimed at the right places to talk to each other, or am I using the wrong libraries, or using them in the wrong way, or whatp

Negative 1141 pAt the moment I am using a custom overlay on a codeUIImagePickerControllercode, calling codetakePicturecode to capture images. However, it takes a good few seconds to call the delegate method codedidFinishPickingMediaWithInfocode. Ive heard about using codeAVCaptureSessioncode for my control over the camera. Would this allow me to get faster picturetaking speeds similar to that of Snapchat Or are there any other ways that I canp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm implementing my image capture as follows.p  pFirst I initialise a UIImagePickerController, using a UIView subclass called codeCustomCameraOverlayViewcode for the overlay view, and present it in a modal view.

Negative 1141 phope someone can help. I have a pretty big XML file that needs tidying up. Basically some line breaks are present which we need to get rid of. There are roughly 19,000 codeltLocationgtcode tags with text between. Is there a way to have NPP search for all codeltLocationgtcode tags, select it up to the closing  tag and perform join lines Join lines fixes the problem, but its going to take all day checking each one.p  pEDIT Sorry, dont think I explained it very well So basically there are more tags present in this XML document, for example p  precodeltAccomRefgt ltCodegtBT1ltCodegt ltLocationgtSometimes the text in here has line breaks like thisltLocationgt ltAccomRefgt codepre  pI guess ideally I need to keep the tags nice and tidy with breaks after each closing tag, but just ensure that all location text is joined without breaks. I tried CTRLA  CTRLJ but that then makes the file incredibly hard to read Hope this makes more sense.p

Negative 1141 pSo the problem with this solution, as Ive understood it, is that its too time consuming. In the a hrefhttpadit.ioposts20130511TheDiningPhilosophersProblemWithRonSwanson.html relnofollowexplanation I was readinga and also on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDiningphilosophersproblemResourcehierarchysolution relnofollowwikipediaa its assumed that philosopher 1 has both forks 3 and 5. But now he also needs fork 2, so he drops 3 and 5 then picks up 2, 3 and 5 respectively. Now, in the frame of our example why would a philosopher actually ever need three forks at the same time if he only needs 2 to eat Or have I misunderstood something along the way p

Negative 1141 pI would like to use a Apple mobile device iPhone, iPod touch to connect to a Windows CE device via bluetooth, but it failed.  Iphone returns an error message that the device is not supported.p  pI understand about the MFI process but its too difficult to get approval from the Apple MFi Team for a Windows CE device so I dont even bother to try.p  pAnother way is change the bluetooth profile in the WinCE so make it as a headset or bluetooth keyboard so hopefully Apple can discover it as another device and accept the connection.  I have the CERegEditor to modify the registry and also a COD generator from this link a hrefhttpbluetoothpentest.narod.rusoftwarebluetoothclassofdeviceservicegenerator.html relnofollowhttpbluetoothpentest.narod.rusoftwarebluetoothclassofdeviceservicegenerator.htmla.  I modify the bluetooth profile successfully on the device and verified by Android.  However, Im still not able to use a iPhone to connect to it.p  pI tried to make it as a wireless headset or handsfree but its not discoverable by the iPhone, or it just directly refused to connect.p  pIf I made it as a keyboard, its discoverable by the iPhone, but it doesnt connect after I send a pair request and type in the correct 4digit pin.  iPhone returns the out of range error even its just next to it.p  pI hope I can get some help here.  I appreciate if anyone can share similar experience before or provide me an appropriate COD code which works for you, or any other methods that can let me to make a connection.p  pThanks for your attention.p

Negative 1141 pImagine the case where you have three buttons side by side. You want the three buttons to fill the available width, and be perfect squares with a minimum size set, with a set amount of space between them. To set this up, you would have the following constraintsp  pAbr 11 Ratio to Abr Leading to superviewbr Width and height  25p  pBbr Equal width and height to Abr Leading to A 50p  pCbr Equal width and height to Abr Leading to B 50br Trailing to superviewp  pNow imagine the available width is small enough such that there isnt enough horizontal space in order to ensure the buttons are a perfect square with 50 between each of them. Instead of breaking the aspect ratio and width constraint, you would instead like to decrease the amount of space between the buttons. My question is, how do you do thatp  pI thought I would just change the relation of the leading constraints to be less than or equal, but this results in Inequality Constraint Ambiguity with those two constraints. I figured perhaps I need to specify a minimum value for leading, so I added two more leading constraints set to be greater than or equal to 10. That didnt resolve the ambiguity. I then added another set of leading constraints, this time equal to a set value that is inbetween the two values, then I decreased the priority of those. This resolved the ambiguity, however the space between the buttons is never decreased  its always the value I set for the constraint with the equals constraint despite its lowered priority.p  pWhat constraints need to be set to obtain thisbrp  ul liThree buttons displayed side by side in the same horizontal spaceli liAll three buttons are perfect squaresli liA minimum size for the buttons 25x25li liA set amount of space between them  50li liWhen the horizontal space is too small to ensure the constraints can all be satisfied, it should decrease the amount of space between the buttons. li ul
Negative 1141 pi have writtenCopied code for a tcpip server.  We have software that sends a message via TCPIP and expects a return message back to say Receive is Acknowledged. This works fine. But after sending the acknowledgment the connection drops out. I am not sure where in the code this dropout is occurring. So when the next message is sent, there is no connection so it does a rollback and reconnects again and then send the message. So every time i send multiple messages i will keep getting rollback alerts. We will be constantly sending messages all day long.

Negative 1141 pI have a web application running on Weblogic. It has  com.jamonapijamon2.81 as maven dependency. Im using codeorg.springframework.aop.interceptor.JamonPerformanceMonitorInterceptorcode with aop configuration. For every servicedao method call, jamon interceptor calculates statistics and stores them in memory. p  pI setup a jetty base for deploying jamon.war and started it. I can access it via a hrefhttplocalhost3162jamonjamonadmin.jsp relnofollowhttplocalhost3162jamonjamonadmin.jspap  pHowever, it shows only local statistics. It doesnt show any statistics from my web application running on Weblogic. This did not suprise me since I didnt do any configuration for this. The question is that how can I do this magic configuration to make jamon.war see the statistics collected in my web application running on weblogic.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1141 pI have a small Mesos cluster and Im using Marathon to manage a set of longrunning services with a variable number of instances each.p  pId like to be able to launch new nodes or terminate some of them as required by business needs. However, when terminating a node I realized there is a potential problem when I shut down a Mesos slave, it happens that the number of instances of some services falls temporarily below the defined codeminimumHealthCapacitycode. That can lead to some downtime if, for example, the machine to be stopped is running a service with only one instance.p  pConsider the following simplified scenario node 1 is running service A, node 2 is running service B and node 3 is running service C. The codeminimumHealthCapacitycode for all services is 1. I want to terminate node 1 and leave only 2 and 3 running. I dont want any downtime on service A. An example of intended behavior would be to scale service A to 2 and then safely terminating node 1.p  pWhat can I do to make sure no service falls below the codeminimumHealthCapacitycode p  pIdeally, I would have a rollingupdate inspired process for that  replacements are launched in separate machines, followed by the termination of the services in the machine to be shut down. I would like to have at least an automated process to do that, so that a scale down is a simple script away. I have no requirement for the amount of time it takes to do that, i.e. I can shut down the Mesos slave only after Im sure the Marathon migration is finished and successful.p

Negative 1141 pWhat would be the correct way to handlegain an increase in API request rate limit with the Instagram API.p  pInstagram API doc state that We recommend that you use an Oauth token for the authenticated user for each endpoint, even in cases where its not required, since the rate limit for authenticated calls scales as you grow the amount of people using your app..p  pHow does that manifestp  pIf a person authenticate their Instagram profile to my Instagram client, will my Instagram client get an increase in authenticated queries  above the default 5000  and i will use my Instagram client token to make queries since the rate limit is now increased.p  pOr is the increase just another way of saying, that now that you have user tokens, you can used each of them for 5000 authenticated queries pr hour.p  pThe questions isnt so much in regards of using client token or user token in the matter of read rights in queries  but more a question on how the rate limit is increased in an Instagram Client when people authenticate it, and how that should be manifested in the queries you make to Instagram on behalf of the userprofile. p

Negative 1141 pIm trying to use Semantic UI and jQuery with Webpack. Seemingly a very simple concept, but made impossibly complex in this case. I cant find a solution on the web that demonstrates both jQuery and Semantic with Webpack.  The problem Im having is that Ive had semantic and jquery load via the index.html through a CDN. Now that I want to move them to the bundle, I need both to be available globally. p  pIve usedp  precode new webpack.ProvidePlugin      jquery,     jQuery jquery,     window.jQuery jquery , codepre  pThough I cant test if it works since semantic loads before hand and tries to use jQuery which is not available. I want semantic to be available globally as well, as I dont think its something i can import explicitly. p  pThanksp
Negative 1141 pI have been searching for days but I am still not able to understand how exactly these differ in functionality and what role does each of them play in Media Playback It would be very helpful if someone can explain the difference. Thanks in advance p
