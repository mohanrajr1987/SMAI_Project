Positive 376 pI am migrating a Windows Phone 7.8  application from to Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight  and ultimately possibly to Windows Phone 10.. p  pBut now I am stuck in a triviality of not getting Background Audio Player to work in Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight at all.

Positive 376 pWe need to create an application that can be used via the browser but that can also be used while offline.p  pThe browser Version will be used by our customer to do calculations. Each customer needs to log into the application with a username and Password.  The offline version will be used by our own employees. They need to be able to use this Version while not connected to a Network. The data that is needed for the application will be stored in XML files.p  pWe are mainly programming with C and the .NETFramework. We thought about using WPF for the client version.  I have read that you can use Silverlight or XBAP to create a browser Version of the WPF application. AFAIK Silverlight is a dying Technology. How about XBAP Would you still invest into this Technology p  pThe other solution would be to create two front end applications The WPF application as an offline application and a web application e.g. ASP.NET MVC as a web application. Thought, this would mean that we would have to create two frontends more work.p  pIs there another alternative  Would it be better to create an HTMLJavaScript application e.g. with AngularJ or something similarp

Positive 376 pAfter updating a Silverlight project from Blend 4 Silverlight 4 to Blend for Visual Studio 2013 silverlight 5 blend is very slow. E.x. takes it 5 seconds to select an element in an view. I have 1000 behaviours in the project. By reducing this amount to the amount of behaviours used in one view 10 behaviours blend seems OK responding. There is no problem in visual studio 2013. For me it seems that blend by selecting anything rescans all files in the solution Any solution p

Positive 376 pi am working on an asp.net web application, where tasks are assigned to users, we set standard time to every task, in that standard time period the user has to finish the task, there are two buttons on the page, proceed and save, when a user clicks on proceed button, the time is saved in database as starttime, and when the user clicks on save button, the time is saved in database as endtime. this way we are capturing the time period within which the user is completing the task.p  pthe standard time is set on an average time study basis, not every time the task takes the same amount of time.p  poften users can complete the task in very less time than the standard time, in this case the users are proceeding the task and even after completing the task, instead of saving it, they lock the system and go for tea breaks and after coming from break, they save the task.p  pi want to save some information on the web page when they lock the pc even when the browser is minimized.p  pi tried implementing applet using jintellitype library but its not capturing the key combinations that are used by windows os.p  pi also tried using Silverlight but there is no such support as in winforms application in Silverlight, i have to create a com component or something that interacts with system32 or some native api. it doesnt seem easy for me, i would like to know if there is such library for Silverlight.p  pit should be browser independent, i havent tried ActiveX, but i think it can be done using ActiveX, but i dont want to use ActiveX as it runs only on IE.p  pi want to know all the possible solutions to achieve this.p  pthanks in advance.p

Positive 376 pI have a number of Silverlight apps hosted in an ASP.Net Web Forms Application based on the Navigation Application template.  My company has upgraded to IE11 and we are now experiencing the White Screen of Death on browser refreshes and after using the Back button.  A lot of searching has me believing that the only way to solve the WSOD is to replace the object tag that Im using with JavaScript to load it during the onload event of the html body.  While it does appear to fix the WSOD, when I navigate to other pages, the url in the browser does not update, therefore the Back button navigates to the previous web page not Silverlight page.  It appears the the generated html tag differs a bit  possibly most significantly by the applicationxsilverlight vs. applicationxsilverlight2  I did note that the Silverlight.js file does contain the 2, so Im not sure why the output does not use it.p  pHas anyone dealt with this before and come up with a workaroundp  pOriginal codep  precodeltdiv idsilverlightControlHost stylepadding0pxgt         ltobject idSilverlightClientControl datadataapplicationxsilverlight2, typeapplicationxsilverlight2 width100 height100gt           ltparam namesource valueltGetXapLocationgtgt           ltparam nameonError valueonSilverlightError gt           ltparam namebackground valuewhite gt           ltparam nameminRuntimeVersion value4.0.60129.0 gt           ltparam nameautoUpgrade valuetrue gt           ltparam nameinitparams idinitParams runatserver valueltGetInitialParamsgtgt           lta hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkID149156ampv4.0.60129.0 styletextdecorationnonegt               ltimg srchttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId161376 altGet Microsoft Silverlight styleborderstylenonegt           ltagt         ltobjectgt         ltiframe idslhistoryFrame stylevisibilityhiddenheight0pxwidth0pxborder0pxgtltiframegt      ltdivgt codepre  pUpdated JavaScript version function called in onload event of body tagp  precodefunction createSL              Silverlight.createObjectEx                     source ltGetXapLocationgt,                     parentElement document.getElementByIdsilverlightControlHost,                     id SilverlightClientControl,                     properties                          background white,                         version 4.0.60129.0,                         height 100,                         width 100                     ,                     events                          onError onSilverlightError                     ,                     initParams ltGetInitialParamsgt                           codepre  phtml generated by object tagp  precodeltobject width100 height100 idSilverlightClientControl datadataapplicationxoleobjectbase64,long string of characters  typeapplicationxsilverlight2gt           ltparam namesource valueClientBinTicketMaintenance.xap9242015 35125 PMgt           ltparam nameonError valueonSilverlightErrorgt           ltparam namebackground valuewhitegt           ltparam nameminRuntimeVersion value4.0.60129.0gt           ltparam nameautoUpgrade valuetruegt           ltparam idinitParams nameinitparams valueMATaxFreeStartDate8152015, MATaxFreeEndDate8162015gt           lta styletextdecoration none hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkID149156ampampv4.0.60129.0gt               ltimg style altGet Microsoft Silverlight srchttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId161376gt           ltagt ltobjectgt codepre  phtml generated by the JavaScriptp  precodeltobject width100 height100 idSilverlightClientControl datadataapplicationxoleobjectbase64,long string of characters  typeapplicationxsilverlightgt     ltparam namebackground valuewhitegt     ltparam namesource valueClientBinTicketMaintenance.xap9242015 35125 PMgt     ltparam nameinitParams valueMATaxFreeStartDate8152015, MATaxFreeEndDate8162015gt     ltparam nameonError valueslEvent0gt ltobjectgt codepre
Positive 376 pfolks, I am maintaining a silverlight project with silverlight at client side and WCF service hosted in IIS at service side. It has been working abnormal recently. I added exception logging code to the common base class of business classes using AOP mode. And then it stopped working totally. I dont want to insert debug code in each method all over the classes and rebuild the old project. I want so much to use AOP mechanism to intercept the invoking messages and capture all exceptions, because in that method much fewer codes are needed. But now I am not sure if Silverlight is compatible with ContextBoundObject. My codes are shown as fellowp  precode[ServiceContract] public interface IJob        [OperationContract]      void DoSomething    [AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsRequirementsMode  AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Required] public class JobService        public void DoSomething                 new JobBroker.DoSomething         [ExceptionLogProxy] internal class JobBroker  ContextBoundObject       public void DoSomething                   ...         public class ExceptionLogProxy  RealProxy      ...

Negative 376 pIve got a WPF application on an ultrasound machine that displays ultrasound images generated in C at a speed upwards of 30 frames per second.p  pFrom what I understand, the normal process for displaying images in WPF is to create a BitmapSource for your image and set the Source for your Image, which then causes it to invalidate and display.p  pSince BitmapSources do not implement IDisposable, using this method forced me to create 30 BitmapSources a second. For a 640x480 image with 32bppArgb format, this is around 30MBsec of memory being allocated a second and then garbage disposed every 10 seconds, causing visible lag. Obviously not an acceptable solution.p  pMy currently solution isp  pstrongIn Cstrong I create a System.Drawing.Bitmap WinForms bitmap in Managed C, do a memcpy from a pointer to populate the picture, use the Graphics object to do some additional drawing I need, and pass this into the CWPF during an ImageReceived event.p  pstrongIn Cstrong Image.Source is set to a source generated by BitmapBuffer, which is a hackway of accessing the raw data of the bitmap source See a hrefhttpjmorrill.hjtcentral.comHometabid428EntryId16WPFHackeryPartII.aspxthis link.a I do a PInvoke of CopyMemory to copy the data from the Bitmap.Scan0 into the BitmapBuffer. I then invalidate the Image to update the screen, and Dispose the Drawing.Bitmap object to free the memory.p  pWhile this method has worked for a while, it seems very hacky and I find it hard to believe that there is no other appropriate way to do this than through reflection.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there a better wayp

It is an requirement for the project that every change made to the source data is logged, for auditing purposes.  The tables with the logging contain things such as bank account numbers, into which vast sums of money will be deposited.  There are maximum a few thousand records, and they should only be modified very rarely.

Negative 376 pThe ISO C Standard ISOIEC 9899 and the ISO C Standard ISOIEC 14882 are not published online instead, one must purchase the PDF for each of those standards. I am wondering what the rationale is behind this... is it not detrimental to both the C and C programming languages that the authoritative specification for these languages is not made freely available and searchable online Doesnt this encourage the use of possibly inaccurate, nonauthoritative sources for information regarding these languagesp  pWhile I understand that much time and effort has gone into developing the C and C standards, I am still somewhat puzzled by the choice to charge for the specification. The a hrefhttpwww.opengroup.orgonlinepubs009695399OpenGroup Base Specificationa, for example, is available for free online they make money by charging for certification. Does anyone know why the ISO standards committees dont make their revenue in certifying standards compliance, instead of charging for these documents Also, does anyone know if the ISO standards committees a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21atrociously looking websitea is intentionally made to look that way Its as if they dont want people visiting and buying the spec.p  pOne last thing... the C and C standards are generally described as open standards... while I realize that this means that anyone is permitted to implement the standard, should that definition of open be revised Charging for the standard rather than making it openly available seems contrary to the spirit of openness.p  pP.S.  I do have a copy of the ISOIEC 98991999 and ISOIEC 148822003, so please no remarks about being cheap or anything... although if you are tempted to say such things, you might want to consider the high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who might not have all that much extra cash. Also, you might want to consider the fact that the ISO website is really sketchy and they dont even tell you the cost until you proceed to the checkout... doesnt really encourage one to go and get a copy, now does itp  pbEdit  Commentbbr  It occurs to me that if the ISO standards committees were to make their revenues from certification that it would incentivize smaller but more frequent changes to the standard rather than very large revisions very infrequently. It would also incentivize creating an implementable standard I doubt the ISO C committee would have introduced export in the first place if they got their revenues from certification.p  pI have found a solution to one of the annoyances of not having the PDF online.... I have uploaded my copy of the standards into my Google Docs, so that I can still access it from any computer without carrying it around.p

Negative 376 pIm trying to write an Android application that will use plugins. These plugins will just be other Android applications without a launcher.

The choice the user makes may or may not show an activity, but it will return the list of images to the application. However, this list of images, isnt just a list of URLs to the image itself, because some sites which the user should be able to get the images from needs parsing, and that takes time, rather its a resource as of how to obtain the list of images, so that later, I can connect to a contentprovider that will download the images needed on the fly.p  pHowever, I also have a service running that gives the user the ability to mark a given set of images like a chapter, or album for downloading, and then the service will download the images specified, but my application doesnt know how to get images from flickerfacebookany other plugin, so I was wondering how I can make my service talk to the plugin to download the images in the background without having to fire an activity that the user needs to see.p  pAny thoughts of how this can be achieved would be appreciated.p  pPS.

Negative 376 pOK I am going to try to explain this the best I can and maybe someone will understand it. I have a CRM application I am building and have the following tables contacts, email, phone, website and address. I have been trying to create a Query that gathers all the info into one result set. I have kind of found a way that works 99.9 but I think I am missing something for that 1 to work and have killed myself trying to find it. p  pMy query looks like this p  precodeSELECT  contacts.fullname, contacts.title, contacts.company, contacts.background, GROUPCONCAT email.emailtype ORDER BY  email.emailtypeas emailtype, GROUPCONCAT email.email ORDER BY  email.emailtypeas email, GROUPCONCAT phone.phonetype ORDER BY phone.phonetypeas phonetype, GROUPCONCAT phone.phone ORDER BY phone.phonetypeas phone, GROUPCONCAT website.websitetype ORDER BY website.websitetypeas websitetype, GROUPCONCAT website.website ORDER BY website.websitetypeas website, GROUPCONCAT address.type ORDER BY  address.type  as addresstype, GROUPCONCAT address.addressstreet ORDER BY  address.type  as street, GROUPCONCAT address.addresscity ORDER BY  address.type  as city, GROUPCONCAT address.addressstate ORDER BY  address.type  as state, GROUPCONCAT address.addresszip ORDER BY  address.type  as zip, GROUPCONCAT address.addresscountry ORDER BY  address.type as country FROM contacts Left Join email ON contacts.id  email.contactid Left Join phone ON contacts.id  phone.contactid Left Join website ON contacts.id  website.contactid Left Join address ON contacts.id  address.contactid GROUP BY contacts.id ORDER BY contacts.id ASC codepre  pNow like i said it works like 99.9 of the way I want it to but here is the result set now this is a simulated result object but it follows what currently is spit out after the query.p  precodestdClass Object      [fullname] gt John Mueller     [title] gt President     [company] gt Mueller Co.

So in this case you get 4 of the same item in all the other supporting tables. p  pI have tried everything I can and maybe it cant be done but I thought I would try one more time and see if anyone would look at it and say oh yea youre missing 5 letters that will make it work or something. At this point even a your stupid that wont work woud be great too. p  pThanks again for any help anyone can offerp  pUPDATEp  pI feel Like such a noob now, I pulled a classic mistake i checked my result without full verification, but at the same time by the information i provided it was not clear. Ill explain my original solution worked except that when i had 3 work type1 numbers i would end up with a result like phonetype  1 and phone  5551212,5551213,5551214 this is fine but when i have 2 work and 1 home the type identifiers were useless, but i never said that you can have more than one of any type for a contact so actually both of my answer below are correct, with that said the sql was a bit malformed but i knew what he was saying so it actually worked better and correct on the nose. BTW just pulling distint from the type fields wouldnt do it either ... I tried that. p  pPatial new query solution p  precodeSELECT  contacts.fullname, contacts.title, contacts.company, contacts.background,  innerphone.phone, innerphonetype.phonetype  FROM contacts  left Join SELECT phone.contactid, GROUPCONCATphone.phone ORDER BY phone.phonetype as phone FROM phone GROUP BY phone.contactid  innerphone ON contacts.id  innerphone.contactid left Join SELECT phone.contactid, GROUPCONCATphone.phonetype ORDER BY phone.phonetype as phonetype FROM phone GROUP BY phone.contactid  innerphonetype ON contacts.id  innerphonetype.contactid  ORDER BY contacts.id ASC codepre  pThank you for your answers, and as a side note I just canceled that overpriced Experts Exchange this is so much easier to use and find what you are looking for and best of all free   thanks again. p

Negative 376 pIve written a WPF application in Visual C 2010 Express that has 2 windows.  The 1st has a various buttons, the other displays video using the MediaElement control.  When a button is pressed, a video associated with it is played or stopped if its already playing.  p  pOn my development machine Windows 7, good graphics card, lots of memory etc, this runs fine.  The only problem Ive encountered is that when attached to the debugger it is very unstable but when run normally these issues go away.  p  pUnfortunately when run on a much less powerful XP machine the videos run at 12fps.  This is despite the fact that the videos run fine in Windows Media Player.p  pThere seem to quite a lot of reports of poor performance for the MediaElement control not to mention inconsistencies in what it can play so I decided to look at some alternatives.p  pI tried a free library call WPF MediaKit httpwpfmediakit.codeplex.com that I thought might have some effect, however while Ive got it to work on an XP machine, it resolutely refuses to display videos on my development machine despite using exactly the same code.  Im still hoping I can this to work but Im not confident it will help given its still using the MediaElement control behind the scenes.p  pI then tried using wmp.dll COM control Windows forms rather than WPF and even with the simplest app new Windows Form project, WMP control added to form, and 1 line of code to set the URL on load I get odd behaviour.  With the debugger attached, it works across multiple monitors, but sometimes when it starts playing, it just repeatedly stutters over the 1st few frames and the only way to break it out of this seems to be to move it to the other monitor.  If Im not using the debugger, I dont seem to get the stutter issue but the video is only displayed on the main monitor, as soon as I move the window to the secondary monitor, it goes black.p  pSo my question is has anyone experienced anything like the above andor have a decent solution to it  It would be especially nice to find something that works consistently with and without the debugger attachedp

And the constraint is that both dimensions will be filtered.p  pThe suggested time sorted array is an obvious solution to handle the timedimension. To increase query performance an tree based index might be used. A binary search itself isnt so easy as each entry might have a different size  but the index tree covers that nicely and basically has the same underlying idea.p  pGoing that route first one dimension time, then the other one will result in a poor performance I fear for the ID filtering, as I have to use a brute force lookup.p

Negative 376 pThe standard idiom for codepthreadatforkcode usage is supposed to be to obtain all locks in the prefork handler, and release them in both the parent and child handlers. However as far as I can tell, this is impossible. codepthreadmutexunlockcode is specified to either have undefined behavior in the case of normal or default type mutexes or to fail in the case of recursive or errorchecking mutexes if the calling thread is not the owner of the mutex. And in the child handler registered with codepthreadatforkcode, the calling thread is the main thread of the newly created process, and thus emcannot beem the owner of the mutex.p  pAm I mistaken or is the whole codepthreadatforkcode idiom broken by design and essentially impossible to usep  pstrongEditstrong I also fail to see any valid portable workaround for the issue. Ideally one could just destroy and reinitialize the mutexes in the child process, except that calling codepthreadmutexdestroycode on an initialized mutex is specified as undefined behavior in order to accommodate ridiculous implementations where mutexes are not POD but involve a reference to some kernellevel object.p

Negative 376 pDuring bulk load of entities into a database, I have a scenario where an incoming entity relies on an existing entity in the database in order to compute a value.

Negative 376 pThis hopefully is an easy one... Im trying to find a WPF panel that I can use that when resized keeps all its vertically aligned children buttons offset the same distance from the bottom edge of the panel, so it looks like they are expanding.p  pThe obvious one is to use a dock panel and anchor to the bottom but this doesnt seem to work. Putting more that 2 children in there messes up the alignment and whatever I do I cant get them vertically lined up. Ive tried all sorts of panels but have had no joy. Im assuming its fairly straightforward but its stumped mep  pBasically Im trying to get a concertina effect when I click the top button the panel expands and shows all the sub buttons. And when I click the top button again it collapses. I guess I can move each of the children with a storyboard but I have to think all my story needs to do is change the size of the panel and the children maintain their offsets and concertina out...p  pAny ideasp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 376 pim writing a little c app to wrap around the opencv haar training function namely cvCreateTreeCascadeClassifier. The function throws a whole load of output to the console and I wish to parse this output so that I can populate various variables in my code.p  pThe function I wish to use is not part of the actual openCV library instead it has to be built with my code as part of the project. All of the output from the the function is via printf.p  pQuestion Is it possible to intercept the printf statements before they end up on the console Ive managed to redirect them using freopen but this seems a little clumsy as I then need to parse the file and then delete it when the function call is finished. Also, the function is likely to be running for several hours and possibly even weeks so the size of the file might be an issue if its constantly being appended too.p  pRequirements I need this app to be c and to run on both windows and linux but have no problem with conditional compile statements if need be. I would also like to be able to still see my cout and cerr messages on the console just not the printf.p  pMy googling has removed my will to live Can anyone help with a solution via either code example or pointers to places I should be looking for an answerp  pThanksp

The size is number of bytes of the message after serialization I guess. I thought PrefixStyle.Fixed32 says there is only one uint32 before the message but there are 4p  pFinally, I thought you should use ProtoWriter.WriteInt32intbuf.Length, writer to transfer integers because I followed suggestion from a hrefhttpmarkmail.orgmessagev5oy24eyshdb254hquery3aDeserializeWithLengthPrefix20cpage1mid3afcsyebmstgt5nfz2state3aresults relnofollowsomwhere in the interneta which I suppose is a workaround relevant to C. Now I see you shouldnt write varints  they are related to the engine and that is to sophisticated to spend time on.p  pShould I send a message with an int How should I distinguish that from next message that size is stored in the first onep  pI see C can hadle prefixes fine but is there ANY COMPATIBLE with C and C way to state size of a message Otherwise, there is no ememing way to queue messages what I would find irrational.p

I gave up trying to get the code to work in objc and rewrote it in Python.  It has now been running for a couple of hours, checked 1.2 billion of the 1010 combinations, has not clagged up the system memory and on average is using 50 less CPU time than the objc code.

Negative 376 pI am looking for an algorithm to generate pseudo random numbers in a three or better n dimensional space of large extents. When initialized with a seed the generator should be able to repeatedly produce the same numbers for the same seed.p  pBut unlike most generators available in programming languages, it should not just return the next random number in a sequence, but instead generate numbers for specific coordinates, no matter in what sequence the values are requested.p  pThe size of the space should be regarded as too big to generate all the numbers at initialization time. In Java it could look something like thisp  precodeRandom3D gen  new Random3Dseed int n1  gen.getInt3,0,6 int n2  gen.getInt2,3,1 ... codepre  pHow would I do something like thisp  pI tried it in Java by writing some code using java.util.Random, but the quality of the results was not very good.p

Negative 376 pI do not want to violate MVC, Id like to achive the following Im rolling my own authorization lib with ActiveAdmin.

Negative 376 pSpring provides formatters and converters with the use of annotations. This means that a request parameter can be annotated on a controller to format user input and also a property of a data model class can be annotated to format data for a view.p  pThe latter seems to me as a clear violation of MVCs main purpose, that is the separation between model and view. Annotating a data model class with formatting specifics binds the model to the view. If the model hast to be used for some other view or for anything else, it cant, since its fields are formatted for a specific view.p  pIf I am wrong let me know. If not, is there a way to format fields from and to view format without violating MVCp

Negative 376 pI am using a 3rd party WinForms Login Dialog in my WPF app, and for some reason this is making my WPF application not close correctly when debugging.p  pIf I exit the winforms login dialog prior to logging in, the application closes correctly, however if I login successfully and launch the WPF window, exiting the window does not shut down the application. p  pI put a breakpoint in the codeOnExitcode method of codeAppcode and it never gets called.

Negative 376 pIm facing writing a reasonably large program for a research project that will probably be used only by me, or possibly also by a small number of people that might take it over in the future. The point is  its not a commercial application, and wont be publicly available. And my question  in such a case are there really any good arguments behind defining all my classes private rather than public The whole code is meant to be a job sequence scheduler. So, for example, I have a basic job class that looks likep  precodeclass Job   private     should it be     int Jobid      int stackrow   horizontal positon in a stack     int rowheight      position in a column of containers      float ArrivalTime     float FinishTime     float GantryTime      float WaitingTime  Job Start  Job Arrival     float ReachableTime  later time of Vehicle or YC arrival to job location      float DueDate     float Tardiness  max0, Cidi Ci, Completion time  Finish time di, DueDate     float SlackTime     int type  1, Loading 2, Unloading    codepre  pThen theres a class for a sequence of jobs, simulation data, machines involved, and a number of other things. The point is, I end up with lot of classes, and even more components for them. All of them will be used either only by me, or a small number of other people. I could define all classes private, with codesetwhatevercode, codegetwhatevercode functions for all private components that need to be set or read, but is there really a point to it A  it takes time. B  it doesnt make for a very legible code when I writep  precodejobschedule.joblist[i].setfinishtime jobschedule.joblist[i].getArrivaTime    jobschedule.joblist[i].getProcessingTime   codepre  pinstead ofp  precodejobschedule.joblist[i]  jobschedule.joblist[i].FinishTime  jobschedule.joblist[i].ProcessingTime  codepre  pSo my question is  is there a really good reason I would stick to private classes in this case Or maybe there is a more elegant way to dop  precodejobschedule.joblist[i].setfinishtime jobschedule.joblist[i].getArrivaTime  jobschedule.joblist[i].getProcessingTime   codepre  pwhile remaining privatep

Negative 376 pI think the title for this question is probably wrong, but Im not sure quite how to phrase it. I have a C 4.0 VS2010 WPF application. p  pThis application consists of a single window with a header including the basics logos, captions, etc and a set of navigation buttons back, retry, next, etc. The rest of the window is comprised of a listbox that is populated with one or more usercontrols based on what mode the app is currently in. p  pThe way the code is currently written when the mode changes the listbox is cleared, all new user controls are added, and the buttons are set to their required state. This is fine for the initial state of each window mode but Im having trouble deciding a good approach to update the navigation buttons as the contents of the controls change.p  pFor example one screen is a configuration screen and there are three user controls contained within the listbox. These controls are custom classes that inherit from UserControl. Additionally they implement an interface that defines a method bool Validate which determines if the control has been completely filled out.p  pThis same scenario could apply to lots of other situations but this is a generic use case that is pretty straightforward to understand. When the screen initially loads the Next button, whose visibility is controled by the parent window, is visible but disabled as the child controls cant possibly yet be valid. At some point as the user fills out arbitrary data within one or more controls each one would return true if its Validate method was called. p  pAt the point where all controls are valid, the next button would then become enabled. Fairly straightforward design.p  pThe problem is each control doesnt know what screen it is on, and this is by design. I dont want the controls having to be aware of each other and updating a button status in the parent window. I also dont want the parent window to run a polling thread to call Validate every second because in some cases the validation could be complex.p  pIm thinking that the change event of each control within the UserControl text boxes, radio buttons, etc would all call a trigger a private validate event and this would set some public property on the interface or class. p  pf I can do that is there a way for the parent window to respond in an eventdriven manner to the change of that property Im not looking to do this in WPF, doing this in C code is preferable as I dont want to get into the complexity of WPF quite yet. Im just not sure, other than constant polling, how to tell when every controls IsValid property will have synchronized all to true, if that is even a good approach.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, here is another way to ask the question. I have a List of something in this case a list of an interface and want to be able to respond to a public property change on each item in the list so I can take an action when all items are bool in this case true. The above explains the use case, but this is a more generic version of the question.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pVincent you might do it in an even simpler way with a custom ValidatedChanged event that you can hook in the same way.p  pIt turns out that this is really what I was looking for. The property notification approach seems to be more for ease of use with databound controls. I read a lot of posts on this site about how to implement that but it really wasnt what I wanted. I just wanted my objects to notify that an event occured, which happened to be a property change, but that is beside the point. I found documentation on implementing an event in an interface and I have it working now. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction and helping me realize what is really is that I needed.p

Negative 376 pSo this is in relationship to dealing with the Large Object Heap and trying to minimize the number of times I instantiate a byte[]. Basically, Im  having OutOfMemoryExceptions and I feel like its because were instantiating too many byte arrays. The program works fine when we process a couple of files, but it needs to scale, and it currently cant.p  pIn a nutshell, Ive got a loop that pulls documents from a database. Currently, its pulling one document at a time and then processing the document. Documents can range from less than a meg to 400 megs. hence why im processing one at a time. The following is pseudocode and before Ive optimized.p  pSo the steps Im doing arep  ol lipMake a call to the database to find the largest file size and then multiplying it by 1.1p  precodevar maxDataSize  new BiztalkBinariesData.GetMaxFileSize maxDataSize  maxDataSize  null ampamp maxDataSize gt 0      longmaxDataSize  1.1      0 var FileToProcess  new byte[maxDataSize] codepreli lipThen I make another database call pulling all of the documents without data from the database and place these into an IEnumerable.p  precodeUnprocessedDocuments      claimDocumentData.SelectStatusCodes.CurrentStatus.WaitingToBeProcessed foreach var currentDocument in UnprocessDocuments        all of the following code goes here  codepreli lipThen I populate my byte[] array from an external sourcep  precodeFileToProcess  new BiztalkBinariesData     .GetcurrentDocument.SubmissionSetId, currentDocument.FullFileName codepreli lipHere is the question.

Negative 376 pA beginners question, probably a trivial one. Heres the XUL code snippetp  precodeltwindow     xmlnshttpwww.mozilla.orgkeymastergatekeeperthere.is.only.xulgt      ltscript typeapplicationjavascript srcchrome...main.jsgt      ltbutton labelClick me oncommandclickhandlergt ltwindowgt codepre  pThe JavaScript codep  precode main.js  var test  Peanut butter     a global variable  function clickhandler      alerttest  codepre  pThe interpreter processes the JavaScript file just after reading the main windows opening tag and then proceeds with the rest of XUL code. In my opinion, the codetestcode variable should go out of scope in the very moment the interpreter finishes processing codemain.jscode. Moreover, the codeclickhandlercode function should have gone out of scope too, which means, when the button is clicked, nothing should happen. Well, unless I declare them as codedocument.testcode and codedocument.clickhandlercode, for instance. However, a simple experiment proved me wrong. Both the function and the variable exist when the button is clicked. What is the actual life span of variables declared like this When are they destroyed Are they around until the application exits Any best practices and references are highly appreciated.p

Negative 376 pIm running tomcat and I want to change the default codewebrootcode so that it points to another location.  Is there a way to find out whats running tomcat or where the default webroot is set as I cant find httpd.conf which is where I believe its usually setp  pCheers,p  pAlexei Blue.p  pUPDATEp  pIts been a long time since I looked at this question that I forgot about it.  In the end it turned out that we were using Apache HTTPD to accept requests from port 80.  From there we had the codewebrootcode and codeProxyPasscode rules set in the codeetchttpdconfvirtualhostsdefault.confcode file these can also be set in codeetchttpdconfhttpd.confcode.  From there we had several tomcat instances running, all hosted on different ports which are setup in codeapachetomcatxconfserver.xmlcode.pp  pWhen I wrote this question I was trying to setup a new tomcat instance to run an application in development and was told I would need to change the codewebrootcode to access my application, which was incorrect.  Instead what I needed was to include a codeProxyPasscode rule so that when my application name was recognised in the URL, HTTPD would send the request to the correct tomcat instance to be processed. E.g.pp  precodewww.domain.commyApplication  In etchttpdconfvirtualhostsdefault.conf  ProxyPass myApplication ajp127.0.0.1ltajpportgtmyApplication ProxyPassReverse myApplication ajp127.0.0.1ltajpportgtmyApplication codepre  pWhere the ajpport is setup in codeapachetomcatxconfserver.xmlcode.  I needed to ensure that non of the ports conflicted with other tomcat instances so remember to check all ports i.e. Shutdown, HTTP, HTTP with SSL, AJP etc.p

Negative 376 pLet explain what Im trying to create. Im creating a framework, the idea is to provide base classes to generate a math problem.p  pWhy do I need this framework Because at first time, I realized when I create a new math problem I always do the same steps.p  ul listrongConfiguration settings such range numbersstrong. For example if Im developing multiplications, in beginner level only generate the first number between 25 or in advanced level, the first number will be between 6 9, for example.li listrongGenerate problem methodstrong. All the time I need to invoke a method like this to generate the problem. This one receives the configuration settings and generate the number according to them. And generate the object with the respective data.li listrongValidate the problemstrong. Sometimes the problem generated is not valid. For example, supposed Im creating fractions in most simplified, if I receive 24, the program should detect that this is not valid and must generate another like this one, 14.li listrongLoad the viewstrong. All of them, have a custom view please watch below the images.li listrongAll of the problems must know how to CHECK if the user result is correctstrong.li listrongAll of this problems has answersstrong. Some of them just require one answer, anothers may require more than one, so I guess a way to maintain flexibility to the developer has all the answers he wanna used.li listrongAt the beginning I started using PRISMstrong. Generate modules for each math problem was the idea and load it in the main system.li ul  pI guess are the most important things of this idea.p  pLet me showing some problems which I create in a WPF standalone program. Here I have a math problem about areas. When I generate the problem a set to the view the object and it draw it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comH46YA.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSNwLq.png altenter image description herep  pIn beginner level, I set in the configuration settings that just load square types. But in advance level, can load triangles and squares randomly.p  pIn this another, generate a binary problem like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAQUzo.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYGJgE.png altenter image description herep  pAbove just generate a single problem. The idea of this is to show a test o quiz, I mean get a worksheet this I call as a collection of problems where the user can answer it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwMiqy.png altenter image description herep  pI hope gets the idea with my ugly drawing.p  pHow to load this math problems As I said above, I started using PRISM, and each module contains a math problem kind. This is a snapshot of my first demo.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtoywO.png altenter image description herep  pBelow show the modules loaded, and center the respective configurations or levels.p  pUntil momment, I have no idea to start creating this software. I just know that I need a question  problem class, response class, user class.p  pBut I get lost about what properties should have to contain in it.p  pPlease give a little hand of this framework. I put much effort on this question, so if any isnt clear, let me know to clarify it.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 376 pAn Visual Studio project, for ASP.NET or WCF, typically is assigned onetoone with an IIS application.   But what if, for example, I want two WCF projects to be hosted in the same appdomain within IIS  This implies that I would have two Visual Studio WCF projects assigned to a single IIS application.p  pI started to try this out, and ran into the a hrefhttpscottonwriting.netsowblogarchive20100217163375.aspx relnofollowfirst error messagea.  Ive a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5278089284758seen commentsa suggesting how not to do this.  But in my case, I actually emwantem to do this.  I dont mind if this means having three web configs for the IIS application one at the root of the IIS app, the other two in project folders it contains or if it means having only one web config for the IIS application.  p  pSo for my two Visual Studio WCF projects, Ive shuffled around web.config contents in a variety of waysp  ul liOne IIS application, pointing at the physical directory where my Visual Studio solution file is found.  The two WCF projects are in two respective subfoldersli liOne IIS application, pointing at some arbitrary physical location, containing two virtual directories pointing to the two WCF project physical directories, respectively.  I have three web config files here one for the IIS app root, the other two in the virtual directories.li ul  pA variation of the second option above nearly worked.  The final error message I got wasp  blockquote   blockquote     pThe type Sample.ServiceGroupAlpha.ServiceAlpha, provided as the Service attribute value in the ServiceHost directive, or provided in the configuration element system.serviceModelserviceHostingEnvironmentserviceActivations could not be found.br     strongDescriptionstrong An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request.

Well, this didnt work, but I cant help but think Im close to making this work.  Id like to know if anyone has a fix, or can relay the correct way to accomplish this whole thing.p  pUltimately the answer may be that there is no such thing as having two separate webWCF projects within the same IIS application I would be surprised if that was the case.  Another answer may be combine the two WCF projects into a single Visual Studio projectbinary.  Please assume I dont want that answer either.p

Negative 376 pI am writing a webapp on Google App Engine with python and right now I am using the built in federated login system with OpenID and it works great with GoogleYahooAOL but I want to give users on Facebook and Twitter access to the site as well.

So i have to make somehing like a select query with 2 groups and date range. p  pAs the table grows larger, the select query performance is decreasing dramatically. What can i do to get better results p  pI have created another table with summarized sales like hourly, daily and monthly, but there are functions that i mush search from the sales table. p  pthe first application was written in c asp.net webservice and mssql server with stored procedures as database, these operationg were quick as few seconds top. and i had the same about of data, even i wasnt using any summarized table the make queries quicker. p  pI know, a dedicated server application will always be faster than an embedded server, but i think there must be a way to improve the performance of this query. p  pIs there any optimizations that i can do over H2 engine.p  pBecuase of concurrency issues, i had to enable MVCC on H2 server, could this be a problem on performancep  pThanks for reaindg and spending your time. p  pememEdit For people who use Play Framework 1.2.xp  pive just added Indexnamesalescolumnnameindex annotation on each column i want to add to index and now H2 engine is working even faster than my old mssqlasp.net application. p

Negative 376 pI need to copy data from one cluster to another cluster. I did some research and found I could do copyTable, which basiclly scan and put data from one to another.p  pI also know that I can copy over the whole HDFS volumn for Hhase. I am wondering if this works and if perform better than copyTable I believe it should perform better since it copy files without logic operationsp  pThanksp
Negative 376 pI try to port a C tool to x64 in VS2005. The problem is, that the code contains inline assembly, which is not supported by the 64bit compiler. My question is, if there is much more effort to code it with clear c or use intrinsics. But in this case not all assembler functions are available for x64, am I right Let say, I have a simple programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  void main     int a  5    int b  3    int res  0      asm             mov eax,a        add eax,b        mov res,eax           printfd  d  dn, a, b, res  codepre  pHow must I change this code using intrinsics to run it Im new in assembler and do not know about most of its functions.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI made changes to compile assembly with ml64.exe like Hans suggested.p  precode add.asm   ASM function called from C  .code  AddInt PROC,     aDWORD,     receives an integer     bDWORD      receives an integer  Returns sum of a and b, in EAX.        mov  eax,a     add  eax,b     ret AddInt ENDP END  codepre  pstrongmain.cppstrongp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  extern C int AddIntint a, int b  void main      int a  5     int b  3     int res  AddInta,b      printfd  d  dn, a, b, res  codepre  pbut the result is not correct code5  3  1717986920code.

Negative 376 pstrongExamplesstrong Say I have several 1D arrays, such as A, B, and Cp  precode A    B    C       2    4    99  3    5    37  4    6    42       7 codepre  pI want to use a formula to pad each of these arrays which are named ranges so they have the same number of rows.  emEdited, to provide a more complete explanationem  I would also like to be able to shift the starting position of each array by a specified number of rows.  Here is an example output, where Im shifting A by two, B by three, and C by one positionp  precode A   B   C       0    0    0  0    0    99  2    0    37  3    0    42  4    4    0  0    5    0  0    6    0  0    7    0 codepre  pSo the formula really a combination of multiple existing standard formulas to pad one of the arrays would effectively have four inputs the original array namerange, the number of values to pad at the beginning of the original array, the number to pad at the end, and the padding value i.e. 0, NA, etc..p  pstrongInitial approachstrong My first attempt was to concatenate the three array sections beginning padding array, original array, and ending padding array into one array like thisp  pcodeINDIRECT amp IFNPadBegingt0, REPTPadValamp,, NPadBegin1 amp PadValamp,,  amp ArrayName amp IFNPadEndgt0, , amp REPTPadValamp,, NPadEnd1 amp PadVal,  ampcodep  pwhere the variables with underscores are named ranges for the four inputsp  pHowever, it doesnt seem possible to build an array like this.  Ive searched for other methods to combine 1D arrays using a formula, but came up empty.p  pAnother approach might be to create an array of the final desired length and initially populate it with the padding value.  For example, create an A array with eight rows of 0.  I can do this step in a dynamic formula.  Then you could overwrite the values in this initialized array with the original array, making sure to shift the original array to the correct location.  For example, overwrite the 0 values in rows 2 through 4 of A with the values of A.  I cant figure out how to do this second step...p  pstrongBackgroundstrong I have multiple 1D arrays of data generated using dynamic named ranges that I would like to plot together on a single line chart.  The arrays have differing lengths however, so I need to pad each array with a certain number of NA values at the beginningend of the array.  They also need to be lined up based on an index.p  pIt probably wouldnt be too difficult to achieve this in VBA, but Id prefer a nonuserdefined formulabased solution.p

Negative 376 pWhat are the differences between codeFOObar .configurecode and code.configure FOObarcode, where code.configurecode is a script generate by autoconf from a codeconfigure.amcode  I know that the former sets the environment variable codeFOOcode to codebarcode before running the script code.configurecode, and the latter passes the string codeFOObarcode to code.configurecode.  I think that code.configurecode interprets this and remembers it as setting the variable codeFOOcode equal to codebarcode, but beyond that, I dont know.  In particular, are there any advantages to doing it one way or the otherp

Negative 376 pI have a situation where I would like to use a single QThread to run two or more separate methods at different times. For example, I would like the QThread to run codeplaycode sometimes, and when I am done playing, I want to disconnect the QThread from this method so that I may connect it somewhere else. In essence I would like the QThread to act as a container for anything I would like to run in parallel with the main process.p  pI have run into the problem where starting the QThread and then immediately disconnecting it causes strange behavior at runtime. Before I discovered what race condition meant or really understanding much about multithreading, I had the sneaking suspicion that the thread wasnt fully started before being disconnected. To overcome this, I added a 5 ms sleep in between the codestartcode and codedisconnectcode calls and it works like a charm. It works like a charm but it isnt The Right Way. p  pstrongHow can I implement this functionality with one QThread without making the call to codesleepcodestrongp  h2Code Snippet in Questionh2  precodedef playself          self.stateLabel.setTextStatus Playback initated ...          self.myThread.started.connectself.mouseRecorder.play         self.myThread.start         time.sleep.005  This is the line Id like to eliminate          self.myThread.started.disconnect codepre  h2Full Scripth2  precodeclass MouseRecordQtCore.QObject      finished  QtCore.pyqtSignal          def initself          superMouseRecord, self.init                  self.isRecording  False         self.cursorPath  []      QtCore.pyqtSlot       def recordself          self.isRecording  True         self.cursorPath  []          whileself.isRecording              self.cursorPath.appendwin32api.GetCursorPos             time.sleep.02                      self.finished.emit      def stopself          self.isRecording  False      QtCore.pyqtSlot         def playself          for pos in self.cursorPath             win32api.SetCursorPospos             time.sleep.02                  print Playback complete         self.finished.emit              class CursorCaptureQtGui.QWidget      def initself          superCursorCapture, self.init          self.mouseRecorder  MouseRecord          self.myThread  QtCore.QThread          self.mouseRecorder.moveToThreadself.myThread         self.mouseRecorder.finished.connectself.myThread.quit          self.initUI      def initUIself          self.recordBtn  QtGui.QPushButtonRecord         self.stopBtn    QtGui.QPushButtonStop         self.playBtn    QtGui.QPushButtonPlay                  self.recordBtn.clicked.connectself.record         self.stopBtn.clicked.connectself.stop         self.playBtn.clicked.connectself.play          self.stateLabel  QtGui.QLabelStatus Stopped.

Negative 376 pI recently uninstalled, then reinstalled WAMP, But now my domainszend projects are malfunctioning. I can only access the front pages for these domains but not any further pages, which I explained in a previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14677307cannotaccesszendprojectsafteruninstallingandreinstallingwampthreada Everything suggested on the thread and more have not worked so far.p  pSo I have another idea from searching google which suggests that WAMP has not been completely uninstalled when I did the first uninstall, and the solution is to go to regedit after uninstall, do a search for wamp then delete all records related to wampserver. Id done this but Im getting 216records and only three of them has a mention of wamp on the record names. I feel it cant be right to delete all 216records and im scared because these records point to other programs and systems in windows.

Highlight Computer and press the [Ctrl][F]   key combination to launch a search box.  Type in wamp as a search   term.  Delete all instances of a record pertaining to WampServer.  On   a healthy installation, there may be 70 such entries or more.  Just   grit your teeth and get it done, making sure all the while that the   search result is indeed a WampServer related entry...p blockquote  pI have deleted the 3records I found with mentions of wampserver, but yet no solution to my problem. So my question is Could the instruction possibly be to delete the entire 216records in order to completely clear my system of all traces of the old WAMP installationp

Negative 376 pThe bottleneck of my current project is heap allocation... profiling stated about 50 of the time one critical thread spends within the codenewcode operator.p  pThe application cannot use stack memory here and needs to allocate a lot of one central job structurea custom jobbuffer implementation small and shortlived but variable in size. The object are itself heap memory codestdsharedptrcodecodestdweakptrcode objects and carry a classic CArray codecharcode payload.p  pDepending on the runtime configuration and workload in different parts 300k500k object might get created and are in use at the same time but this should usually not happen. Since its a x64 application memory fragmentation isnt that big a deal but it might get when also targeted at x86.p  pTo increase speed and packet throughput and as well be save to memory fragmentation in the future I was thinking about using some memory management pool which lead me to codeboostpoolcode. p  ol lipAlmost all examples use fixed size object... but Im unsure how to deal with a variable lengthed payload A emsimplifiedem object like this could be created using a boostpool but Im unsure what to do with the payload Is it usable with a codeboostpoolcode at all p  precodeclass job  public     static stdsharedptrltjobgt newObj  private     delegatet call     argst  args     unsigned char  payload     sizet payloadsize  codepreli lipUsually the objects are destroyed when all references to the sharedptr run out of scope and I wouldnt want to change the sharedptr back to a cptr. A deferred destruction of the objects should also work to increase performance and from what I read should work better with a boostpool. I havent found if the pool supports an interaction with the smartptr The alternative but quirky way would be to save a reference to the sharedptr on creation together with the pool and release them in blocks.pli ol  pDoes anyone have experiences with the two boostpool usage with variable sized objects and smart pointer interactionp  pThank youp

Negative 376 pI have a program where I need to read the contents of several pipes, compare the words, print smallest word, get a new word from that pipe and that pipe only, compare again, until all pipes are empty.p  pI have a couple issuesp  p1 For some reason I can only read from one pipe.  When trying to read from the others, it keeps giving me nothing, even though if I set the pipe to be any of the others, it works with that pipe only.  p  pBasically, I cant get sortOutput to switch to the other pipes when I want it to.p  p2 For some reason I cannot seem to detect when an array element is empty so it compares  to the word, and  is always lower.  p  pAs far as I can tell, what is happening is that sortOutput is set to the last pipe, and then it keeps reading from that pipe instead of the other pipes,  or nothing if forced to read from the other pipes via the loop.  Im unsure why, but if I set sortOutput explicitly to a different pipe without a loop, declared globally, it will read all words from any of the other pipes just fine.  Its switching sortOutput to other pipes within the loop that is causing the problems, I think.  Strangely enough, when setting up the initial word array, switching sortOutput to other pipes works just fine.  As a note, I have to use fgets, I dont have a choice in that.p  pHeres the code for the suppressor, I have commented where I believe the problem to be happeningp  precodeSuppressor  Reads one word from each pipe, compares, prints largest.

Negative 376 pIn my javascript application I have big memory leak when making codeAJAXcode call to retrieve codeJSONcode object. Code is really simplep  precodefunction getNewMessage      newmessage  []  this is global variable     var inputforball  []     var sum     var i      var http  new XMLHttpRequest     http.openGET, url  randomball.json, false     http.onreadystatechange  function              ifhttp.readyState  4 ampamp http.status  200                      var responseTxt  http.responseText             inputforball  JSON.parse[  responseTxt  ]                   http.sendnull      newmessage  inputforball  codepre  pThis is called every 1 milisecond and as you see, its synchronous call. This function costs me 1MB every 1 second.p  pWhen I use instead of codeAJAXcode just assigning to variable likep  precode inputforball  JSON.parse[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] codepre  pthen its everything perfect. So error must be in my implementation of codeAJAXcode call. This happened when I use codejQuery AJAXcode call too.p  pstrongUPDATE 12032013strongp  pAs codeTom van der Woerdtcode mentioned below, this really was intended behavior. So as codeMatt B.code suggested, I have rewrote some code to make asynchronous calls possible and it helped a lot. Now my application memory consuming is stable and small.p

My request is that I would like to do the same but having a number in seconds, and if the range is huge, like maybe between 100 and 2500, it should be converted to minutes, what I have now is the followingp  precodeyAxis          title              text Minutes,             margin 10         ,         min 0,         tickInterval 60,         labels            formatter function                 var minutes                   if this.value gt 59                     minutes  Highcharts.numberFormatthis.value60, 0                                  return minutes                           codepre  pwhich is great for range between 60 and 500, but when the range is longer, it draws a lot of lines to display the minutes.p  pAny ideas Can I change the tickInterval depending on some valuep  pI already have seen this reply a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8268170plottingsecondsminutesandhoursontheyaxiswithhighchartsPlotting seconds, minutes and hours on the yAxis with Highchartsa, but I dont want to handle a datetime object on that axis.p

How do I save as a variable the url that the person arrived from there is a paramater I need from there 2. How do I redirect the user to the new url at the end of the steps saving, parsing new url, etc 3. Where do I perform these two main actions In the controller That is my instinct, however, doesnt the view hold the relevant url where is the relevant index url people are referring top

Negative 376 pI have a couple places at my php site where the script should give something like headerLocation error.phpmsgError Message I thought that its not so good to keep those messages inside the code and probably the good way to save them would be some kind of array or constants.

Negative 376 pIm using JAXRS Jersey implementation to build a web service.p  pThe entry point to the web application is a class that extends codeApplicationcode and overrides the codegetClassescode method. I understand that JAXRS will create a new instance for each new request.p  pIt is possible to override codegetSingletoncode instead. My understanding is that this will reuse the same instance for all requests. However, wont this approach assuming Im correct destroy concurrency within the web application That is, since the same instance is always used, incoming requests will be processed one at a time FIFO.p
Negative 376 pIs a private static parameter of a singleton considered a synchronized parameter if the access to it is exclusively through synchronized methods  What if it was public I dont think it is in either case because I believe you can only put the synchronized keyword on labeled blocks and methods, not params.  If the param is mutable in any way reflection even though access is restricted, then it risks being out of sync if not used through the synchronized methods.p
Negative 376 pIm trying to enable SSL on a Token Vending Machine hosted on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. However, it tells me I need an SSL certificate if I try to enable a port 443 listener.p  pThis would make sense if I had my own domain, but this is a system machine giving out tokens to a mobile app. The URL is of the form codemytvm.elasticbeanstalk.comcode and will never be seen by an end user so theres no need to get a custom domain.p  pIs it possible to enable SSL without the hassle of setting it up on a custom domain name Pretty much every host Ive used before had a wildcard SSL certificate for stuff you ran on a subdomain of their main host. In other words I would expect Amazon to have had setup a wildcard certificate for code.elasticbeanstalk.comcode. Is this not the casep

How would I do thisp
Negative 376 pIve set a repeating alarm on a service and decided that its most convenient to reset the alarm from within the called service. The reason is that the service already has code to check if its within a userdefined schedule time range. When its outside the time range, it resets the alarm to start at the future time selected by the user.  Maybe Im approaching this wrong but Ill put this question out there and see what you think.p  pAn activity kicks off the service by creating a repeating alarmp  precodeActivity Calendar cal  Calendar.getInstance Intent intent  new IntentgetApplicationContext, MyService.class intent.setDataUri.parseMyServiceidentifier PendingIntent pIntent  PendingIntent.getServicegetApplicationContext, 0, intent, 0 AlarmManager alarm  AlarmManagergetSystemServiceALARMSERVICE alarm.setInexactRepeatingAlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP, cal.getTimeInMillis,             intervalInMins60000, pIntent codepre  pThe service has something like thisp  precodeService Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId      Uri Action  intent.getData     try          if Action.equalsUri.parseMyServiceidentifier              Simplifying the code here CalculatedOffset is determined from the current time             and scheduled start time. intervalInMins is read from settings.             if WithinSchedule                  Calendar cal  Calendar.getInstance                 PendingIntent pIntent  PendingIntent.getServicegetApplicationContext, 0, intent, 0                 AlarmManager alarm  AlarmManagergetSystemServiceALARMSERVICE                 alarm.setInexactRepeatingAlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP, cal.getTimeInMillis  CalculatedOffset,                         intervalInMins60000, pIntent                            catch NullPointerException np          np.printStackTrace          return Service.STARTREDELIVERINTENT  codepre  pI was hoping to reuse the intent to reset the repeating alarm. With this new code, Im seeing multiple alarms stack up firing rapidly in succession around when the start time hits. It should not spaz out like that, but should fire at regular intervals as it did before the scheduling reset. I need to catch it in the debugger but havent been able to determine the exact conditions yet. Is my understanding of alarms completely off base here Is there a better way to do thisp  pAddendum A wrinkle in this is that Im using RootTools to gain superuser privileges in order to work around Android 4.2s airplane mode. This hasnt been a problem before the scheduling, but Im suspicious whether su is blocking for a long time while the alarms stack up.p

Negative 376 pI have 3 checkboxes and need user to select atmost one at a time, so have a code where everytime user selects one of my checkboxes.

When I set styling for the different levels, sometimes the foreground color for the text is White and sometimes its Black depending on the background color.  Heres my dilemma.

Negative 376 pIm currently implementing a redblack binary search tree for geometric interval search. Im saving in the tree segments containing a startpoint and a endpoinit where the startpoint is the key entry to the tree. My concern is to be able to save into the tree segments which have the duplicate starting point or if you prefer, which have the same key. Its a kind of C multimap for geometric search. The solution I came up with is for each entry who has duplicate keys, save a list or vector of segments with corresponding duplicate keys. The problems I see with this approach are twofold 1. It will reduces the efficiency of the search if  there are a large number of duplicate keys. 2. Ill have to use more memory to store the duplicate keys.p  pMy question is is there another way to implement this more efficientlyp
Negative 376 pSo Im making a plugin and I was wondering would it be possible to movecopy the project from folder A to folder B and then all the compilation is done from folder Bp  pThe purpose is that the project files will be encrypted and I would then move them to folder B and then decrypt them. Then eclipse would handle them normally.  Once they savequit the files it would save a encrypted version back to folder A. Of course folder B would get deleted once eclipse is closed.p  pIs it possible to make eclipse compile from a different folder that is not in the workspace using a plugin of course. I will be trying to make it seem like the user is working on the original encrypted files.p

Negative 376 pI am running 64bit Fedora 18 and trying to update Glassfish 4.  Glassfishs update tool doesnt run 64bit apparently, and needs 32bit compatibility libraries.

Negative 376 pI have implemented a conditional variable example. However, I see that once I sleep after the signal is received by the  pthreadcondwait. The code after sleep is not executed. It directly jumps to the else condition. I understand that the mutex is unlocked now. I have just two threads A and B. Both the threads have two different startup routine. If I put a sleep in thread A after getting a signal, then it should schedule thread B. Now, once thread B is done. The thread A should resume from the place after sleep. However, it is resuming not from sleep. It reacquires the lock. See my example, and its output.

In LogAttribute Im reading content as string ReadAsStringAsync so I dont lose request body. p  precodepublic class LogAttribute  ActionFilterAttribute       ..     public override void OnActionExecutingHttpActionContext actionContext               stuff goes here         var content  actionContext.Request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync.Result           content is always empty because request body is cleared           public override void OnActionExecutedHttpActionExecutedContext actionExecutedContext               other stuff goes here         var content  actionContext.Request.Content.ReadAsStringAsync.Result          content is always empty because request body is cleared            ..  codepre  pOn the other hand Ive put FromBody attribute before my action parameter class to take advantage of its benefits. p  precode[Log] public class SomethingController      public HttpResponseMessage Foo[FromBody] myModel               something       codepre  pThe problem is the content is always empty either in ActionExecuting or ActionExecuted.p  pI think this is because FromBody runs before my Log attribute unlike their order in the code. And again I think its because of finding the best actioncontroller match for the request according to action parameters Route Processing. After that my request body is cleared since request body is nonbuffered in WebApi. p  pI want to know if there is any way to change the run time order of FromBody attribute and my Log attribute or something else that solves the problem I should mention that I dont want to remove FromBody and using HttpRequestMessage instead of my Model or something like that.p
Negative 376 pI have an algorithm that requires the construction of an NxN matrix inside a function that will return the product of this matrix with an Nx1 vector thats also built on the fly. N is usually 8 or 9, but must be generalized for values greater than that.p  pIm using the Eigen library for performing algebraic operations that are even more complex least squares and several other constrained problems, so switching it isnt an option.p  pIve embenchmarkedem the functions, and theres a huge bottleneck due to the intensive memory allocations. I aim to build a thread safe application, so, for some cases, I replaced these matrices and vectors with references to elements from a global vector that serves as a provider for objects that cannot be stored on the stack. This avoids calling the constructorsdestructors of the Eigen matrices and vectors, but its not an elegant solution and it can lead to huge problems if considerable care is not taken.p  pAs such, does Eigen either offer a workaround because I dont see the option of passing an allocator as a template argument for these objects, OR is there a more obvious thing to dop

Negative 376 pI am working on a large C code base and I want to speed up its compilation times. One thing I know is that all of my library includes are on a network drive which slows down things a lot. If I can get make or something else to automatically cache them, either in tmp, or to a ramdisk, I expect that to improve the compile times for me quite a bit. Is there a way to do that Of course I can copy them manually and set up a sync job but then every developer will have to do that on every box they ever compile so I am looking for an automated solution. p  pThanksp
Negative 376 pI did common modal popup for one of the project.  For that modal popup, I am passing datamodelsay Salary model as a parameter.  Sometimes we need to pass model as an object i.e. instead of salary model we pass salary object. Based on that i am checking if parameter is an instance of ember or an object .p  pMy question is, can we convert objectsay salary object to ember data model say salary modelp  pFor eg I have a Model like belowp  precodeApp.SalaryDS.Model.extend empnameDS.attrstring, empsalaryDS.attrstring   Json object salaryid1,empnameRaju,empsalary5000 codepre  pFor some reasons , I pass ember salary model as an parameter  salary objectJSON as an parameterp  pBoth are having same data , but salary model will be ember instance . If i change some thing in node , it will reflect in associated models. But for salary object , if change some thing in node , it will not reflect in associated models . p  pI know salary object is not associated with emberdata model , thats why it will not reflect with salary associated models .p  pSo is there any way to convert that salary object into salary model . So if i change something in the node , it will reflect associated models .p

The above code works as desired when I log in to a root shell and start the program manually.p  pHowever, when I have the program start automatically by systemd at startup, the schedule setting fails with a permissions error.

Negative 376 pIm using a binary in CygwinWindows where some libraries are loaded dinamically with codedlopenpath.cstr, RTLDLAZYcode but in this case, the C singleton pattern doesnt seem to work. Even if the main program initializes the singleton with a codeSingletoninitInstancesome,paramscode call, which sets a private codestatic Singleton ptrcode field of the class, the shared library which calls the codeSingletongetInstancecode and then should retreive the codeptrcode as an initialized values, it returns a codenullptrcode instead. Ive tried to solve the problem by defining a codeSingleton sharedsingletoncode in the main program that could be accessed in other modules with an codeexterncode call, but even in this case codesharedsingletoncode seems to be codenullptrcode.

Negative 376 pI am attempting to develop an interface to be used by different payment processor wrapper implementations, such as stripe, paypal, etc., that can be injected into another class.  The problem I am running into is that it is quite possible that each implementation may require different bits of data to process a payment thus making a common interface across implementations difficult.  p  pIs this a scenario where it would make more sense to create an interface specific to each type of processor and design the receiving class to expect a specific interface While this seems cleanest and keeps things testable it would require some redevelopment of the receiving class to implement a new processor.p  pId like to avoid creating empty interfaces or have an interface with methods for each type of processor and have each implementation throw not implemented exceptions on the methods it doesnt need.  The other option is to have common methods such as ChargeCard that accept an object, which would contain the data needed by each implementation but that doesnt feel right either.  p  pThanks in advance for any help or suggestions.p

Negative 376 pI am writing a program that performs operations on a database of Football matches and data. One of the issues that I have is that my source data does not have consistent naming of each Team. So Leyton Orient could appear as L Orient. Most of the time this team is listed as L Orient. So I need to find the closest match to a team name when it does not appear in the database team name list exactly as it appears in the data that I am importing. Currently in my database I have a table Team with a data sample as followsp  precodeTeamID  TeamName    TeamLocation 1       Arsenal     England 2       Aston Villa England 3       L Orient    England codepre  pIf the name Leyton Orient appears in the data being imported I need to match this to L Orient and get the TeamID 3. My question is, can I use the LIKE function to achieve this in a case where the team name is longer than the name in the database I have figured out that if I had Leyton Orient in the table and was importing L Orient I could locate the correct entry withp  precodeSELECT TeamName FROM Team WHERE TeamName LIKE lorient  codepre  pBut can I do it the other way around Also, I could have an example like Manchester United and I want to import Man Utd. I could find this by putting a  sign between every character like thisp  precodeSELECT TeamName FROM Team WHERE TeamName LIKE ManUtd  codepre  pBut is there a better wayp  pFinally, and this might be better put in another question, I would like not to have to search for the correct team when the way a team is named is repeated, i.e. I would like to store alternative spellingsaliases for teams in order to find the correct team entry quickly. Can anybody advise on how I might approach this Thanksp

Negative 376 pI was using hstore, Postgresql 9.3.4, to store a count for each time an event happened in a given day, with an update like the following.p  precodedayscount  dayscount  hstorex, coalescedayscount gt xinteger, 0  1text codepre  pstrongWhere x is the day of the year.strong After running a simulation of expected behavior for production I ended up with a table that was strong150MB  2GB Toast  2530MB for the indexstrong, after Analyze and Vacuum.p  pI am now instead breaking up the above column into one for each month like the followingp  precodeymonthdayscount  ymonthdayscount  hstorex, coalesceymonthdayscount gt xinteger, 0  1text codepre  pstrongWhere x is the day of the month, and y is the month of the year.strong I am still running the simulation right now, but so far at third of the way done I am at 60MB  A pretty steady 2030MB of Toast  2530MB for the index. Which means in the end I should end up with about strong180MB  3040MB for Toast  25MB30MB for the indexstrong after Analyze and Vacuum.p  pstrongSo first is there any known issues with Hstore and Toast bloat that would explain my issue with my first set upstrongp  pstrongSecond will my current solution of breaking up the columns cause any type of issues with hstore and performance in the future because of the number of hstore columns on one table It seems to be steady now with row numbers in the hundred of thousands, and while I know more columns can make things slower, I am unsure if this is worse with hstore columns.strongp  pFinally I did find something out. I have one hstore column that ends up representing each hour a day, so it has 24 different keys. When I run the simulation for just this column I end up with almost no toast, in the KB, but when I run the whole simulation, with the days broken up into months columns, my largest hstore has 52 keys.p  pSo for a simple store of either a counter or a word or two, the max number of keys before I see any amount of toast for hstore is between 24 and 52 keys.p

Negative 376 pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7436366indddarchitecturewheredoikeephelperclassesthis questiona on Stack Overflow, in DDD architecture helper classes can be in different layers depending on their purpose. For example a helper that formats something in a user friendly way would go in the UI. A database helper would go in infrastructure. p  pBut what about helpers that can be used by more than one layer For example age calculation. Age might be required in the model layer for business logic. It is used by more than one entity, so it should not be in a specific entity. Also there are places where age is required merely for display purposes in the UI. Similarly, I have string functions that can be used by more than one layer. For example my custom Right and Left methods could be used for formatting in the UI, but they might also be used in the model, for example conditional logic based on a prefix.p  pSo where should these common methods go My setup is like thisp  ul liUIli liApplicationli liModelli liInfrastructureli ul  pModel is core and has no dependencies on infrastructure, so the common helpers cannot go in infrastructure. I am considering two optionsp  p1 Have another layer called Common or similar that can be used by any layer. This would create a dependency between Model and Common.p  p2 Duplicate the helper logic in whatever layer is needed. Eg Have an Age helper in UI AND have an Age helper in the Model. This would violate DRY, but would not require the domain to have a dependency on a Common layer.p  pWhich option is better Is it OK for the Model layer to have a dependency on a common layerp

Negative 376 pI have an app that is able to detect BTLE devices and connect to them in the developer version.

My app does not deal with background connections. When the user leaves the app it disconnects any existing communications. p  pandp  precodebluetoothle codepre  pThis one seems to be to restrict the users device to only use BT. This is an option for us but not a requirement. If it means it works then well add it but if they dont connect to a device that is ok as well. p  pIm a little confused as to how to test this as well. If my Dev version is working but only the app store one is not Im not sure how to test other than submitting it to the app store every time for review and testing afterwards.p  pThanksp

Negative 376 pI have a complex WPF application that is using a lot of resources from the shared Resource Dictionary. The first Window initialized takes 8 seconds to initialize. The performance issue is less on SSD disk drives but still it requires 2 seconds.p  pI tried to use the Visual Studio Profiler and it shows big expense of time on InitializeComponent of the windows that needs to be displayed.p  pI believe it is related to the Resource dictionary used but I cant replace it because I really need it and because all windows and WPF elements are using the StaticResource references.p  pI tried to optimize the launch as much as it is possible. I created many background threads but this didnt helped too much. Whenever a window needs to be displayed it must be attached on UI thread under the same Dispatcher. This makes a big performance issue and all UI and any Progress bar left on the screen is blocked.p  pSo to summarize. From the point when the ShowDialog is called until the window is displayed it  takes 8 seconds. This is visible only on the first window. Any other window opened after that is displayed quickly.p  pNow I am asking firstly what happens in the background and why this delay is so big and second what can be done to increase the startup speed.p  pI didnt mentioned but there are no Exceptions or DataErrors present during the launch so it is not related to Exceptions.p  pI believe it is something with the initialization of Buttons and other components because almost all of them have the ControlTemplate restyled.p

If thats the case, then the codefovycode parameter would be code  4code radians, correctp  pWith all that said, what is the codefcode variable in the method short for and what is the purpose of itbr I was trying to envision the actual scenario, and I imagined something like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWCask.png altSide view of [perspective in 3D scenep  pThinking like this, I can understand why you divide codefovycode by code2code and also why you take the tangent of that ratio, but why is the inverse of that stored in codefcode Again, Im having a lot of trouble understanding what codefcode really represents.p  pNext, I get the concept of codenearcode and codefarcode being the clipping points along the zaxis, so thats fine, but if I use the numbers in the picture above i.e., code  4code, code4  3code, code10code and code100code and plug them into the codeperspectivecode method, then I end up with a matrix like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp3Wfq.png altenter image description herep  pWhere codefcode is equal top  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVARLE.png altenter image description herep  pSo Im left with the following questionsp  ol liWhat is codefcodeli liWhat does the value assigned to codeout[10]code i.e., code110  90code representli liWhat does the code1code assigned to codeout[11]code doli liWhat does the value assigned to codeout[14]code i.e., code2000  90code representli ol  pLastly, I should note that I have already read a hrefhttpgames.greggman.comgamewebgl3dperspective relnofollowGregg Tavaress explanation on the perspective matrixa, but after all of that, Im left with the same confusion.p

Negative 376 pI have a web application with a websocket connection, and I cannot seem to get the connection to work. It keeps giving me the error access denied java.util.PropertyPermission org.glassfish.tyrus.client.sharedContainer read on the client side log, ad on the server side I get Warning   StandardWrapperValve[default] Servlet.service for servlet default threw exception java.io.IOException Connection reset by peerp  pIm not sure whether this is because of a problem with my code, or with the libraries and classes I used to support that code. When I change the clients target address, it gives the same error but I dont get any errors on the server end. Im not sure if this is because Ive incorrectly configured the connection protocol, and so its hitting the server app but not the websocket port, or if its because of the combination of technologies Im using for the server and the client. Im trying to use the plain JSR 356 for both, but that doesnt quite work for the client. I found out somewhere that the JSR client isnt properly done, but that its supposed to work if you include the Tyrus stand alone libraries in your project, even if you dont actually change your code to use any classes from them. If I leave out the Tyrus library, then I get Could not find an implementation class from my client instead. You can view the source code for my client a hrefhttpgithub.comAgoraProjectJAgoraLib relnofollowherea and for my server a hrefhttpgithub.comAgoraProjectJAgoraWebSocketServer relnofollowherea. Ive gotten the same errors on the client side both when using netbeans with glassfish, and also when deployed to a remote tomcat server. For the browser, Ive been using Firefox under an Xubuntu operating system.p  pSo is this a problem of me just not getting the two aimed at the right places to talk to each other, or am I using the wrong libraries, or using them in the wrong way, or whatp

Negative 376 pI implemented an app to monitor few geofence regions and when a user enters to a particular region , app will show a vicinity message that sends from a server. All  regions radius is set around 200m. I already gone through all the delegate methods and I have understood how the delegate methods fires.p  pTo identify user has entered  to a particular region, I have used didDetermineStateForRegion method and inside it I check whether user is inside the region and then sends my location data to the server alone  with region identifier to get the vicinity message.p  pProblem is sometimes app shows the vicinity messages of geo regions that are located in 47km far away and vicinity messages of multiple geo regions pops altogether at once when triggers a one geo fence region. Theoretically this cannot happen. p  pPlease assist me to sort out this problemp  pSteps that regenerate the problem 1. App open once and then app is killed after some timeWhen app is open once, it will fetch 20 geofences from server and started monitoring for those regionsp  ol start2 liWhen enter to a one region, automatically triggers the events for other geofences alsoli ol  pExpected Results Trigger the geo fence event only for actual region where device is located at in order to get the vicinity message. Not the events for all regions. Since I needed to display the vicinity message  only for current region, it is a major issue for me that trigger all geo fence events at once and displaying all vicinity messages.p  pReally appreciate any kind of support.p  pThank You. p
Negative 376 pCan anyone suggest a design pattern for a masterdetail UI Basically, I have a master page that shows a collection of items. You can select an item, delete, add, edit. When you add or edit, it will show the Detail UI, where the single item is edited and saved. p  pThe master has the basic functionality of p  ul ligetItems collection li ligetItem li lideleteItemli ul  pThe detail has the functionality of p  ul ligetItem li lisaveItemli ul  pMany different objects in my application will have this same pattern they are just different types. My natural tendency is to create two generic base classes that do as much of the work as possible   BaseMaster, BaseDetails classp  pand just inherit from them from each object type.  However from experience I find that you put too much code into the base classes and end up fighting around the functionality of them.p  pI was thinking some sort of dependency injectcomposition over inheritance idea would be the way to go but cannot quite picture it fully.p

Negative 376 pI am creating codelatticecode figures and annotating them with the codegridcode package.  To set coordinates for my figures, I use codeunitcode and related functions from the codegridcode package.  It often helps to add units together, and this is typically no problem.  But I find that a strange problem arises when I try to add native units and the x and yscales for the current viewport dont have a lower bound of 0.  Here is a small examplep  precodelibrarygrid librarylattice   Expected result xyplot010  010, ylimc0,10 myVP lt seekViewportplot01.panel.1.1.vp   y1   lt unit5, native  unit2.5, native convertYy1, native   7.5native, as expected   Strange result xyplot1020  010, ylim  c1020 myVP lt seekViewportplot01.panel.1.1.vp   y2   lt unit10, native  unit5, native convertYy2, native   5native why not 15native   Other results with same lattice plot are as expected convertYunit10, npc     unit5, npc, npc      15npc convertYunit10, mm      unit5, mm,  mm       15mm convertYunit10, native  unit5, mm,  native   10.35native codepre  pFurther investigation reveals that codeunitcode is subtracting codeminylimcode when it does addition in native units.  So, in this example, I expect that codeunit10, native  unit5, nativecode will yield a unit of code15nativecode, but it really yields a unit of 1510native.p  pWhy does unit addition work this way with the native coordinate system, and why does it work a different way with other coordinate systemsp

Negative 376 pI am working on a kiosk application using Windows 7 as the OS, and Win32 C to detect and manage USB drives.

What I have come up with is the possibility of calling DeviceIoControl and passing IOCTLDISKGETPARTITIONINFO as the control code, since the PARTITIONINFORMATION structure returned can tell me whether the partition type is recognized or not.  But this doesnt necessarily tell me whether the USB is corrupt.  I assume this is more likely to tell whether this is a recognized NTFS format, as opposed to a format written by a Linux or Mac system.p  pCan anyone tell me how I could go about detecting corruption in a newly added USB drive, so that I can take the necessary next stepsp  pOne more thing.  Ive tried to purposefully create a corruption on my USB drive so that I can emulate the issue found by our user, but Win7 seems to be smart enough to stop me from doing that.

The benefit would be not having an additional look up when accessing the data itself and not having to define a class with just the id and the data.p  pI know a list of tuples are an option too, but in the near future I will want to store mutable attributes. p  pWhat is the python way to do this p

Negative 376 pI have run into an issue where I have multiple asynchronous requests occuring which grab images and information from the Facebook API and my Firebase database. I want to perform all my asynchronous requests, then store all that data that I grabbed from the Facebook APIFirebase database into one entire object which I can quickly load.

Very good input here from all.p  pThe solutions from patrick and ErwinBrandstetter both work. I will favour Patricks here as my role in this is to convert the system asis. There may be scope to refactor in the future, but at this stage I feel it risky to mess with or improve someone elses duct tape solution i.e the codebase seems overly complex in places, with no sign of documentation, and Im reluctant to poke around or attempt core improvement without more background info on business logic. I suspect parts of the model may need to be overhauled anyway, so [sic]fix favoured here.p  pI suspected some clickjiggery might have generated the original query... trying to give the original dev the benefit of the doubt and assume there was some business pressure that called for a quick i.e mousy turnaround. Complex SQL is not my strong suit but Im glad my instinct was correct, the query being unnecessary complex to begin with. Perhaps the view was an unplanned bolton not designed in the first place. Wise or not, Id probably have tried to hit the problem with an ORM based approach.p  pIm on this project last minute, running cleanup for a relaunch original dev was let go, so am working with a mostly undocumented codebase full of unknown functionality. Running paratrooper as it were. Thankfully, this view issue emappearsem to the last piece of the puzzle. Thank you p

Negative 376 pIm using a library which provides custom codeViewcodes. I want to create a method that accepts only custom codeViewcodes from this library. p  pE.g. I have a codePieChartcode and a codeTableChartcode. codeTableChartcode extends codeLinearLayoutcode but codePieChartcode extends some internal codeabstractcode chart which extends codeViewcode. So, I dont have any abstract class or interface that can describe both these objects.p  pCurrently my method looks like thisp  precodevoid drawView chart, ChartData data      switch data.getType          case PIECHART             PieChartltNumericgt pieChart  PieChartltNumericgt chart              ...             break         case TABLECHART             TableChart tableChart  TableChart chart              ...             break          ...       codepre  pSo, I can actually pass any codeViewcode as a codechartcode parameter, which doesnt look good.

I downloaded STS 3.7 and tried to find out a Spring MVC tutorial on the web. However, most of the tutorials i found are for STS version lower than 3.7 and they all start with Create new project  Spring Template  MVC.  However, When i check my New Project options in my STST 3.7, i only see two Spring options   Spring Project and Spring Starter Project.  1. Under Spring Project, i can see one of the templatesclosest match to a web project named as Simple Spring web maven, and i tried creating the project using that template, but it did not create the same folder structure as was shown in tutorials. For instance, it did not create a WEBINF folder and hence no servletcontext.xml 2. Under Spring Starter Project, i could see a lot of options, one of them was Web and one was WS, but none of them could produce similar folder structure as shown in tutorials like the one here a hrefhttpwww.codejava.netframeworksspringspringmvcbeginnertutorialwithspringtoolsuiteide relnofollowhttpwww.codejava.netframeworksspringspringmvcbeginnertutorialwithspringtoolsuiteidea so again no servletcontext.xmlp  pCould someone kindly explain what am i missing here.

Negative 376 pI am working on a legacy J2EE project that is having serious performance problems under load. Here are some of the features that we are using.p  ul liEJB 2.1 released in 2003li liEJB CMPsli liJSPsli liSession and Entity Beans. No remote EJB callsli liJboss 5li ul  pThe servers CPU usage never goes above 25  on a 4 core machine, and the application stops responding to any request. The database server doesnt even have a load. It is possible that since it never goes above 25 that the problem is outside of the application.p  pI am currently under the belief that application is running at 100, but because the application isnt properly multithreaded it wont utilize more than one core. The EJB spec we are on wasnt even out when multicore CPUs were common.p  pIs there a way I can prove the JVM is locked up, and that the web application is running as fast as it possible canp

It is fine, but for some js libraries it it problem. For example for jsTree jQuery plugin.

Negative 376 pId like to learn how to write better jQuery code that is neater and more extensible. Most tutorials always, for the sake of convenience, use ideal case scenarios. p  pOne of these cases are event listeners on a page. These listeners add up the more a user interacts with a page, which can cause problems, so as in this case.p  pstrongJSstrongp  precode Adding list item Click of Button    document.body.onclick,submititem,functione      var buttonText  this.attrvalue      ifbuttonText  Add Item        var productName  this.siblings.formgroup.childreninput[nameproductname].val       var productDesc  this.siblings.formgroup.childrentextarea[nameproductdescription].val        .listgroupitems.appendltli classlistgroupitemgt  productName  ltspan classhiddenproductdescgt  productDesc  ltspangtltspan classglyphicon glyphiconremove pullright ariahiddentruegtltspangt ltspan classglyphicon glyphiconedit pullright ariahiddentruegtltspangtltinput typehidden nameselectproducts[] value productName  productDesc gtltligt       .productform.slideUp       alertItem added       buttonText         productName         productDesc            e.stopPropagation     e.preventDefault     codepre  pThe above listens for a click event on a button and adds an item to the list. The first time this works fine. If the user adds another item and clicks the button, it then adds the item twice and so on. The tenth click would then result in 10 identical items being added to the list.p  pstrongWhat Ive done so farstrongp  precodee.stopPropagation e.preventDefault codepre  pI  thought that these would prevent this problem.p  pIve also tried adding .off after the target like sop  precodedocument.body.off.onclick,submititem,functione      code here  codepre  pThis however breaks editing and deleting functionality on each item, which I built. p  pId like to know if there is a common practice that is being used to tackle this problem.p
Negative 376 pIm new to AngularCSS and Ive been checking out some stuff about how to flip a card and how to apply different rotations and animations. Ive both flavours where you can flip on hover over and flip on click. I have my new ngapp that has a controller that toggles a css class for flipping a div and all of that works fine. However what I would like to achieve would be something like thatp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjwhazelAaU6v11 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netjwhazelAaU6v11ap  pWhich is in JQuery and honestly I dont know how best it would translate into the Angular world.

Negative 376 pI have a MySQL database linked to a scheduling program. When an appointment is made, it is saved in a table called bookings. Even though the appointment is recurring, it is saved as one row. There is a formula that classifies what kind of recurring event it is once a week, twice a week, once a month, etc.. From the manual, all the parameters are as follow p  ul lis  single event.li lid1  every weekday.li lid  every day.li liwxy  every x weeks on y. y corresponds to an 8 bit representation of the weekdays Sunday is 1, Monday is 2, Tuesday is 4, Wednesday is 8, Thursday is 16, Friday is 32, Saturday is 64.li limdx  every x months.li limxyz  the xth y of every z months. x can be first 0, second 1, third 2, fourth 3 or last 4. y corresponds to the weekday Sunday is 1, Monday is 2...Saturday is 7.li ul  pI created a PHP script that queries from the bookings table, but will only bring up the one appointment that shows the start date and end date. It is followed by a freq column, but I do not have a function or set of parameters that can translate that into querying all the recurring events from the start date to the end date. Also, the startdate and enddate columns are in datetime format yyyymmdd 000000.p  pP.S. I cant post a picture because I am a new member, but I have 5 examples. p  ol liw132 is once a week on Fridays li liw18 is once a week on Wednesdays li lid is a daily appointment li lid1 is only on weekdays  5w104 is every 10 weeks on Tuesdays.  li ol

Negative 376 pLets say I have some computations in Python that take a long time, and are run from the Spyder IDE so the results can be easily inspected and used for further work afterwards.p  pI want to run the Spyder process inside a Docker container that is hosted on a server machine i. e. not the same machine Im sitting in front of. I have already seen that it is possible to run e. g. LibreOffice and Chrome like that, so this should be possible. But these processes were not kept alive when the user detached from the container.p  pNow the question is is there a way to open a Spyder process within a Docker container, start the computations manually, detach from the Docker container, and afterwards reconnect to the container so I return to the still running Spyder GUI to be able to inspect the outcome of the computations and keep working with themp  pTo keep it simple for the users which would be multiple people, but each with their own container, I would not want to have to save the computation results to a file a reread them for further processing.p  pWith IPython, I could probably simply use screen to keep the interpreter alive. But I would not know how to achieve the same thing with Spyder. Can I maybe somehow connect Spyder to a remote IPython interpreterp  pstrongThe solutionstrongp  pThanks to JanSuchotzki, I was able to get a X11VNCservercontainer running alongside a client container where Spyder is installed and that can use the server container for displaying graphics. After additionally setting an environmental variable codeUSERcode, Im able to run Spyder successfully. Only the screen size of the X11server needs to be adjusted not to cut off the edge of the Spyder GUI, then everything works greatp
