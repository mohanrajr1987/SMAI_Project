These periods last 30 seconds to a minute and occur every few minutes.  Duration extends and timeinbetween reduces as time goes on.  Upon restart performance returns to normalp  pStack traces taken at the time of performance degradation indicate a lot of threads Waiting on Condition, however I cannot see the condition.  Usually, I would expect to see the reason the thread is waiting on the top of the stack trace.p  pIn this case, we do not.p  pLooking  GC logs, this does not appear to be related to STW GC collections. they are approx every 30 mins to every hour p  pStack traces taken 2 seconds part show the threads are moving to different parts of code, only to hit up against the Waiting for Condition again. In fact, the same request thread can move Waiting for Condition through its observable life. p  pIf I throw significant load at the server, when it is running fine then I dont see any Waiting for Condition in worker threads. p  pHere is an example stack trace.p  blockquote   pajpbio8014exec281 70085 daemon prio5 osprio0 tid0x0000000074c73000 nid0x21b0 waiting on condition [0x00000000487cb000]

Positive 463 pSeveral years ago I built a system around Flex Builder 2 and ColdFusion 8. It uses MySQL 5.5 and Web Services The application ran very nicely for several years on a hosted server. Then I mothballed it for several years. I tried to revive it a few months ago only to find that the world had changed considerably. Adobe gave Flex to Apache and ColdFusion was up to version 11.p  pI know that I have to migrate to CF10 or CF11,but I wouldlike to use all of the MXML code that I had been using. I installed CF11 and found that all of the data from MySQL was displaying in Flex 2 as nulls. I did some instrumentation on the CF code and found that the query return data, while still on the server looked correct however when viewed on the client all of the data was displaying as nulls.   p  pI hope that someone has also experienced this and can help me with a solution.p  pThank you, Lionel Bentkowerp

Positive 463 pThis is a bit unorthodox of an approach, but I need to post query values into a form handler. What Im doing  is taking a query from a separate database and I need to post those query values into the action page that processes form values to submit to a different database table. p  pIn this case, I dont have a form I just need to post the values of the query into the form action page which will post those values and additional generated values to a dozen different tables. The reason Im trying to do it this way because the form handler page that processes the form values has over 2,700 lines of code that takes those values and operates on them, running numerous codeIF ELSEcode operations to decide which table those values should go in based on other values so simply querying the tables and directly inserting them is not an option. p  pHow can I get the query values into form handler page without using a formp

Positive 463 pI need to dynamically load a form into a Bootbox modal window. Im loading the form through Ajax.

Positive 463 pIm hitting a wall with an issue and its been probably more hours than I care to admit tracking this thing down.  p  pSpecifically what I have is a jQuery AJAX call that posts some data to a .cfc I call the method and I pass in some arguments run a few database queries and then nothing is returned. I then use the success method of the AJAX function to continue on.p  pI developed this on a ColdFusion 11 server and it works a treat. However in my recent move to a Lucee server I am having all kinds of issues with this.p  pFirst I noticed that the success methods werent being called. However Firebug is reporting a 200 OK on the call. So I checked further and the databases queries have all run within the method. Byond that the Lucee logs looks clean as well and acknowledges that the database quereies were run successfully. So everything is reporting fine of the things I know to check. I have doen teh basics and tried different machiens and different browsers in the off chance this was specific, but nothing budged.p  pI noticed that Firefoxes Inspect Element was throwing a no element found error and upon further inspection it was returning that the arguments I was posting to the cfc were undefined. This cause me to dig a bit further and I noticed that it was returning this error XML Parsing Error no element found Still saying that the return was 200 OK, but not ok enough to go through to the success method of the AJAX call.p  pOther ideas I had and attempted with no real results were enabling CORS, including a returntype of JSON which removed the XML error, but did little else.p  pAny ideas of what I can try, Im starting to wonder if the entire Lucee setup was botched and I need to scrap it and reinstall p  pThanks for any help or ideas you can thrown in.p  pstrongEditstrong Apologies for not attaching code, as this appeared to be connected to a server set up I was naively hoping that someone would go, Yeah you need to set this setting and modify this file and youre all good Then wed all have a laugh at Tomcat.p  pIm assuming with the first comment saying, Show us your code that this is not the case.

They had already copied the tools.jar file into the lib folder.  They deleted the stubs folder and restarted the CF server, but we still got the same error.    I visited with them and they showed me that the certificates were indeed in the keystore.  p  pAs described here a hrefhttpshelpx.adobe.comcoldfusionkbcoldfusionmxtroubleshootingscheduledtasks.html relnofollowhttpshelpx.adobe.comcoldfusionkbcoldfusionmxtroubleshootingscheduledtasks.htmla We added some debugging to jvim.config as I ran the web service.

It was NOT installed after all.  So the NA installed the a hrefhttpcertman.riaforge.org relnofollowCertMana add on in CF Admin.

Positive 463 pWeve just upgraded to CF10, and Im finishing up a library of missing utility functions mostly iterationrelated, like codemapcode and codereducecode. These functions should always be available on every page and in every component in the application. They are methods of a stateless component thats basically acting as a module or namespace.p  pI have taken after Underscore and its ilk by referring to the component as codecode. So, usage looks like code.mapmyArray, myCallbackcode. My question is where I should put the codecode variable. I can start every page with codevariables.  new Shared.Components.Util.FunctionalUtilcode, but thats annoying and were going to end up with a lot of useless copies. Id like to have it declared globally and initialized no more than once per request.p  pColdFusions global scopes are CGI, URL, Form, Cookie, Client. These are the scopes used for name resolution that share their values across a request. Of these, the CGI, URL, and Form scopes run the risk of collision and the Cookie scope actually stores data on the client this leaves Client. However, components cannot be stored in Client scope. In fact, the only ones that seem to work are URL and Form, and Form doesnt always exist.p  pNow, stuffing a utility component into URL kind of seems like a questionable thing to do. Is there a saner alternativep

Positive 463 pOK guys.. Im a little stumped on this one..p  pI have a table of items in locations that I am consolidating. The items are spread between different rows like a warehouse. I have calculated what to send where, and the distance between the starting and ending position. p  pNow, I need to develop a report that starts with the shortest move, then from its FINISH location finds the next shortest move with a START location closest to the first moves FINISH location... so if I move obj A from warehouse row 20 to row 30, I want my next line to be the next closest move, probably in row 30, that is also the shortest distance. p  precodeitem  startloc  endloc  distance A     5          10       5 B     14         11       3 C     20         1        19 D     10         13       3 E     10         5        5 F     10         6        4 codepre  pSo the table above would be orderedp  blockquote   pD, B, F, A, E, Cp blockquote  pBasically I want to optimize the amount of trips and spend the least amount of time empty handed..p  pUsing ColdFusion and SQL to do this..p  pEdit from comments below Ill try to clarify further.. The table above would be ordered D, B, F, A, E, C because  D has the shortest distance  3  B is the next closes to Ds end 13  14  F because move B ends at 11, 10 is the next closest row with a move, and F has the shortest move distance in that row A bc F ends at 6, and A starts at 5  E bc A ends at 10 and E starts on 10  C because it is the most inconvenient longest, nothing ends by it so its

Negative 463 pLet me begin with an illustrative example assume the implementation is in a statically typed language such as Java or C.p  pAssume that you are building a content management system CMS or something similar. The data is hierarchically organised into codeFoldercodes. Each folder has a collection of children a child may be a codePagecode or a codeFoldercode. All items are stored within a root folder. No cycles are allowed. We have an acyclic graph.p  pThe system will have a remote API and instances of codeFoldercode and codePagecode must be serialized  deserialized across the network. With a typical implementation of folder, in which a folders children are a codeListcode, serialization of the root node would send the entire graph. This is unacceptable for obvious reasons.p  pI am interested to hear people have solved this problem in the past.p  pI have two potential suggestionsp  ol listrongNavigation by querystrong Change the domain model so that the folder class contains only a list of IDs for each child. To access a child we must query for it. Serialisation is now trivial since the graph ends at a well defined point. The major downside is that we lose type safety  the ID could be for something other than a folderchild.li listrongStop and reattachstrong During serialization stop whenever we detect a reference to a folder or page, send the ID instead. When deserializing we must then look up the corresponding object for each ID and reattach it at the relevant position in the nascent object.li ol

Negative 463 pI already started this in javascript so I dont want to use jquery but can somejavascript expert look at my code and tell me what Im doing wrong and or right Let me tell you what I am trying to accomplish here. I have a menu that consists of four buttons and when you hover over them, they change color and then underneath a heading image is displayed when you hover over the heading, the button should go back to its original color, and then underneath the heading appears another image that contains some text. For the most part the code works ok except in Firefox sometimes the headings shift around and I am assuming that this is because when visible the text image doesnt exist, so the heading falls to where the text would be, I dont have this problem in IE. The biggest problem is the onmouseout. I dont want the original button to go back to the color right away because I need time to be able to roll over the heading to show the text, so I was trying to use a setTimeout function to pause for a few seconds but it didnt work. p  pHeres the codep  precodewindow.onload  rollover function rollover var images  document.getElementsByTagNameimg  Get all the images in the document var roll  new RegExproll var preload  [] var fileLoc  imagesrollovers for  var i0 iltimages.length i   if images[i].id.matchroll  Loop through all the images in document and look for match on roll  preload[i]  new Image preload[i].src  fileLoc  images[i].id  over.gif  Preload the overs into an array. images[i].onmouseover  function   Add a mouseover event to image  this.src  fileLoc  this.id  over.gif  When rolled over, this file now equals the over image var currentButton  this.id  Grab the id of the current image var imageHeader  document.getElementByIdcurrenttitle Grab all images that are titled currenttitle var newHeaderImage  new Image newHeaderImage.src  fileLoc  currentButton  header.gif  Create new image and store Header image inside newHeaderImage.id  currentButton  header New id for new image is file  headerId imageHeader.src  newHeaderImage.src imageHeader.height  newHeaderImage.height  Assign header image id to currect location imageHeader.width  newHeaderImage.width imageHeader.style.visibility  visible imageHeader.onmouseover  function  Attach mouse event for header image  var imageText  document.getElementByIdbuttontext var newTextImage  new Image newTextImage.src  fileLoc  currentButton  text.gif imageText.src  newTextImage.src imageText.height  newTextImage.height imageText.width  newTextImage.width imageText.style.visibility  visible      images[i].onmouseout  setTimeoutmouseOutfileLoc, this.id,3000       codepre  pp  precodefunction mouseOutfileLoc, curButton codepre  pp  precodevar titleImg  document.getElementByIdcurrenttitle var imgButton  curButton this.src  fileLoc  imgButton  org.gif  titleImg.style.visibility  hidden codepre  pp
Negative 463 pI know this is less programming related and more time management related, but I value the feedback of the users on this site. Im finding myself particularly busy this semester, managing various tasks and timelines between work and school. Further, I find myself running around between labs, work, home, libraries, etc. For these reasons I think a web based solution is ideal. Which leads to the question, do you have a recommended web based solution for taskproject management for personal use Ideal would be free or nearly, and one which I could install on my server. Accounting is not a requirement, just management of time and tasks gantt charts would be great. However, svn integration would be really good as I keep my school work in there.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI put a bounty on this, as a good solution would be very valuable to me more so than the rep. The answers so far have been great, but none fit just right for personal use. Ideal would be something that manages files and time with something I could self host. It would be a plus for MACPC solutions as we use MAC OSX in the lab on campus. Currently SVN and a web based time manager seems to be the way to go.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pFirst, thank you for the great responses FogBugz, Trac, and Request Tracker were either strongly recommended or suggested more than once. Trac and Request Tracker are also free and self hosted, however, their strengths seem to lay in team development. Im going to give FogBugz on Demand a shot and see how that works out. I am also going to start using the Drop Box as suggested, great idea  Further, SVN strongemwillemstrong be used for the longevity of everything.  This should walk around the 2 gig issue and self hosting desire. I am considering SVNNotifier for keeping machines current.

As he said, it really does everything I want from task tracking to time management.  Its an amazing and generous free offering from FogCreek.  Thank you everyone, I really appreciate all of the feedback.p  pstrongFOLLOWUPstrongp  pJust to follow up on this item. I have been using FogBugz for two weeks now couldnt be happier. I have started using a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclickB001AAN4PW relnofollowLiveScribes SmartPena in conjunction with FogBugz. I am keeping longer term items within FogBugz, and copy the current weeks items in a journal for the road. The SmartPen makes digitizing the journal painless.p  pFor managing files I am using a mixture between FogBugz, DropBox, SVN, and Unison. I use DropBox to share across the net, say between home and the lab, and Unison to synch up the DropBox folder within the larger SVN working copy not everything is in DropBox.p  pstrongLONG TERM FOLLOW UPstrongp  pIve been using fogbugz much less in favor of the LiveScribes journal. Seems that the traditional pen and paper has an efficiency to it thats hard to beat. Regarding LiveScribe, I have had a few problems with it which has left me uncomfortable with their file format. Their files are obscured in both the naming convention and the format. If they had an open format I would feel much better about entrusting it with my data.p  pstrongemLONGER TERM FOLLOW UP 3 YEARemstrongp  pIve switched to using wikimedia to document my worktimeresearch.

Negative 463 pHope some of you can give some pointers on this one. p  pI generate code where i have to make calls to remote resources like webservices or databases. p  pConsider this piece of code p  precodeclass Parent         IEnumerableltChildgt Children      int SumChildren             note the AsParallel         return Children.AsParallel.Sumc gt c.RemoteCall            class Child              public int RemoteCall           call some webservice. Id like to pool these calls           without having to rewrite the rest of this code        codepre  pFor 50 children, its going to make 50 calls to the service, taking the overhead 50 times. In my real life examples this could easily be a million calls, bringing the whole thing to a crawl. p  pWhat i would like to do is batch these calls in some way that is transparent for the calling threadtask. So instead of calling the service directly, it calls some central queue the  train station that batches these calls.p  pSo that when it does that, the calling task blocks. Then the queue waits for X calls to accumulate and then makes 1 call to the remote service with a list of requests. p  pWhen the result comes this queue returns the return values to the right task and unblocks it. for the calling thread, all this remains hidden and it looks like just another function call.p  pCan this be done Are there primitives in the TPL that will let me do this p  pIt kinda smells like the CCR with lots of things going on at the same time waiting for other stuff to complete.p  pI could of course rewrite this code to make the list of requests on the Parent class and then call the service. The thing is that with my real problem all this code is generated. So I would have to look inside the implementation of Child.RemoteCall, making this all a whole lot more complicated than it already is. Also the the Child could be a proxy to a remote object etc. Would be very hard if doable at all, id rather isolate this complexity.p  pHope this make sense to someone, if not let me know ill elaborate. p

Negative 463 pIt seems that most Delphi applications fit into two classes Databasecentric Applications that use Reporting Systems for all their printing needs, and applications that dont need printing.p  pFor those in the excluded middle nondatabase printing, nonreporting system, there are components to help out. For example, I have been a Developer Express Express Printing System customer since early on in that products life cycle. For printing out any component grid, spreadsheet,etc that is also a Developer Express Printing System component to help me out.p  pSo far so good. What Im looking for is an alternative way in Delphi 2010 to generate one or two page printouts that contain, typicallyp  ul liTitles, and Headingsli liPage Headers and Page Footersli liAbility to include a large picture which is the primary thing on the page. In this case, the picture bitmap is a chart custom drawn by me.li li100 bulletproof output quality on every version of windows known to human kind, with every kind of printer known to human kind.   li ul  p[UPDATE I was previously having bizarre glitches with Developer Express printing components on color laser printers, which I am now quite hopeful I can sort out. ] ... Still I think it would be wise to look at other printing components out there so my toolbox of possible solutions for my current and future projects can include a simple reliable way of generating printer pages. p  pSo I could really use suggestions.  I am biased against Reporting Systems, even Code Based ones, but I am considering fast reports even though my use for it would be far from the typical usecase scenarios. There are no row and column datasets involved in my printed pages.p  pUpdateFinal  It looks like FastReports is great. It can easily transfer any data from in memory in your application such as an Image, to the current report pages, like thisp  precodeprocedure TForm2.Button1ClickSender TObject var   picTfrxPictureView begin   pic  frxReport1.FindObjectPicture1 as TfrxPictureView   pic.Picture.AssignImage1.Picture    frxReport1.ShowReport    frxReport1.Print end codepre

Ive only been able to debug this by repeatedly running amp closing the application, with task manager open, Create Dump File and looking at the resulting 400mb mess in Windbg.  Win7 64 for reference.  Make sure this makes sense to you.p  pEDITp  pThe following code on shutdown still shows the same exception.p  precodeclass IndexNotFoundException  Exception    public static string RunAndPossiblyThrowint index, bool doThrow      try              return Runindex          catch               return    public static string Runint index      ifstore.Containsindex         return store[index]     throw new IndexNotFoundException   codepre  pThe only thing that seems to get rid of the exception is to go straight to p  precodeclass IndexNotFoundException  Exception    public static string RunAndPossiblyThrowint index, bool doThrow      try              return Runindex          catch               return    public static string Runint index      ifstore.Containsindex         return store[index]     return   codepre  pNaturally the exceptions gone, but my fears of going crazy are still present.p  pEDITp  pit just got worse...  this still crashes...p  precodeclass IndexNotFoundException  Exception    public static string RunAndPossiblyThrowint index, bool doThrow      try              throw new IndexNotFoundException          catch               return   codepre  pEDIT I have a distinct feeling this is going to get me nowhere.  On top of the wierd behavior, I can also note that during execution of the UI in the above case, the try catch is being executed faithfully.  My UI doesnt crash amp its full of empty strings.  However once I start closing the UI, the crash shows itself and the try catch no longer holds back the exception.p  pstrongEDITstrong amp final Apparently the dump file was listing in it the most recent firstchance exception.  I verified this by creating a new project that threw inside a try catch amp slept for 10 seconds.  During the wait I got the .dmp file amp sure enough, my completely caught exception was showing up.p  pIll mark some points for the useful answers, however unfortunately theres still no rhyme or reason why my code is crashing...p

Negative 463 pThis is a bit of an open ended question but we have a problem with a web application that on the final step of completing an order, multiple post requests are being made, sometimes up to 10 and all within a couple of seconds to the page.p  pTheirs nothing unusual about the page, the user fills out a form which is then validated using the jQuery form validation plugin. Weve seen this behavior exhibited over a couple of different browser types, notably IE6 but also IE8.p  pWeve also managed to trigger the bug ourselves but nothing out of the ordinary seems to occur on the browsers end, everything progresses as normal.p  pApache logs show that multiple post requests where made at the same time and the Rails logs show that multiple posts requests were also received by the application, leading me to think its a problem with the browser.p  pIve exhausted all avenues that I can think of for debugging so Im throwing this out there to see if anyone has some ideas of what we could try or look for next.p

Negative 463 pThis code doesnt work, but hopefully youll get what Im trying to achieve here.  Ive got a Money class, which Ive taken from a hrefhttpwww.noticeablydifferent.comCodeSamplesMoney.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.noticeablydifferent.comCodeSamplesMoney.aspxa, and extended it a little to include currency conversion. p  pThe implementation for the actual conversion rate could be different in each project, so I decided to move the actual method for retrieving a conversion rate GetCurrencyConversionRate into a derived class, but the ConvertTo method contains code that would work for any implementation assuming the derived class has overriden GetCurrencyConversionRate so it made sense to me to keep it in the parent class  So what Im trying to do is get an instance of SubMoney, and be able to call the .ConvertTo method, which would in turn use the overriden GetCurrencyConversionRate, and return a new instance of SubMoney.p  pThe problem is, Im not really understanding some concepts of polymorphism and inheritance yet, so not quite sure what Im trying to do is even possible in the way I think it is, as what is currently happening is that I end up with an Exception where it has used the base GetCurrencyConversionRate method instead of the derived one.  Something tells me I need to move the ConvertTo method down to the derived class, but this seems like Ill be duplicating code in multiple implementations, so surely theres a better wayp  precodepublic class Money      public CurrencyConversionRate              get                      return GetCurrencyConversionRateregionInfo.ISOCurrencySymbol                    public static decimal GetCurrencyConversionRatestring isoCurrencySymbol              throw new ExceptionMust override this method if you wish to use it.           public Money ConvertTostring cultureName                         convert to base USD first by dividing current amount by its exchange rate.

Negative 463 pbr Im searching for a very high performant possibility to insert data into a MS SQL database. The data is a relatively big construct of objects with relations. For security reasons i want to use stored procedures instead of direct table access.p  pLets say i have a structure like thisp  ul liDocument ul liMetaData ul liUser li liDeviceli ulli liContent ul liContentItem[0] ul liSubItem[0]li liSubItem[1]li liSubItem[2]li ulli liContentItem[1] ul li...li ulli liContentItem[2] ul li...li ulli ulli ulli ul  pRight now I think of creating one big query, doing somehting like this Just pseudocodep  precodeEXEC DeviceID  CreateDevice ...

Since INSERT INTO A VALUES B,C,C,D,E,F is more performant than 3 single inserts i thought i could get some performance here.p  pThanks for any hints, Marksp

Negative 463 pWhat Im trying to do should be very simple but somehow I cant reach the right answer to my problem. Ive asked something similar in the past but the answer given to me previously no longer fits the requirements. So heres whats going on  I need to conditionally select values from a table in my database in a different than the usual manner, like sop  pTablep  ul liId int not nullli liParentId int not nullli liEventOn DateTime not nullli liUser int nullli ul  pBy the following selectp  precodeSELECT RST. FROM RangeSheetTime RST WHERE RST.[User] is not null codepre  pin the above case, I take all the rows where the user isnt nullp  precodeSelect RST. FROM RangeSheetTime RST WHERE RST.[User] is null codepre  pin the above case, I take all the rows where the user is nullp  pSo what am I trying to do I want to build a select statement that when given a condition, such as EventOn lt GETDATE, will retrieve all the rows where the USER isnt null. In case there arent any rows where USER isnt null, then it should retrieve the rows where it is null, if any.p  pHow can I put this to workp  pNote I cant use if here, otherwise this would be easier.p  pEDITp  pIm going to try to explain it the best I can. Imagine I have 3 rows for the same ParentId, 31. 2 of these rows have a column named StartOrEnd set to 1. Theres just a difference between them, for the 1st one, the USER column is null for the 2nd one, the USER column has the value 90. The 3rd row has the column StartOrEnd set to 0. Now, I want to display results no matter the value of startorend. But theres a catch. For every startorend, if there are more than 1 row and one of them has USER set to null and the others not null, then only the non null rows for that startorend will display. but in case there are no non null rows for this condition, than the null values will display. I hope I was clear now.p

Negative 463 pIve a weird situation while keyboard shortcuts of a button along with datagridview is used. Here is the explanationp  pIve a winform in which there is a datagridview and a save button. Save button has keyboard shortcut AltS. I enter some rows in the grid and I validate all the cells on Save button click and if cell value is invalid then Ill set the focus to that cell. Here is the code used to achieve thatp  precode  for var index  0 index lt GridView.Rows.Count index        var itemRow  GridView.Rows[index]      if itemRow.Cells[SomeColumn.Name].Value.ToString  string.Empty             GridView.CurrentCell  itemRow.Cells[SomeColumn.Name]        GridView.Focus         codepre  pAbove code works fine and sets the focus in the particular cell with cursor when I click on the save button.p  pBut, when I use shortcut key, focus is not set to the cell at all. Im not sure why it is behaving like this.p  pOut of curiosity Ive tested an event of the datagridview. CellLeave event of datagridview is fired when I click on save button, but when I use shortcut for save button it doesnt get fired.p  pWhy is it behaving like this any inputs How can I set the focus when I use shortcutsp  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive done a trick to work it properly. Ive added SaveButton.Focus code in the button click event of the save button as first line. This is redundant but forcing the grid to lose the focus when user uses short cut key to access this button. This solution is working fine, but not sure what could be the reason for the above situation. Still looking for an answer. p

But in one place I want the combobox to include an all items option.p  pIs the way to do this simply with xaml converterp  pIt seems like doing it in the view model would be a good idea, but its really a lot dependency object goop to basically wire up an collection that is two objects deep for an on change event, where as the xaml converter just works.p  pBut I always feel like xaml converters should be generic and reusable, where in this instance, the xaml converter would be more of a one off.p  pOf course the third option would be to create one off list for UI in the object that contains the standard observable collection.

Negative 463 pI am not too clear about the IIS lifecycle, but my general understanding isp  ol liEvery couple of hours IIS resets itself. This is apparently done so as to fix up any memory leaks, resource deadlocks etc. etc. ie. It seems to be a cleanup operation.li liEvery couple more hours I think I read 23 hours the server just stops listening to inbound requests and runs ApplicationEnd. An external page request will restart the app.li ol  pCan I get a bit more reasoning to why these behaviors occur Especially with regards to item 2... My server runs internal scheduling behaviors which completely died last night. The reason was that ApplicationEnd occurs and no customer requests were happening to start the IIS server again. This seems weird. Why not just clean up memory leaks etc. and then keep IIS running exactly as it was The only reason I can think of is that it lets the server reclaim memorycpu used by IIS, but that seems nonsensical and the cause of bugs, such as my scheduler issuep

Negative 463 pIve been looking at the new Scala 2.9 parallel collections and am hoping to abandon a whole lot of my crufty amateur versions of similar things. In particular, Id like to replace the fork join pool which underlies the default implementation with something of my own for example, something that distributes evaluation of tasks across a network, via actors. My understanding is that this is simply a matter of applying Scalas paradigm of stackable modifications, but the collections library is intimidating enough that Im not exactly sure which bits need modifyingp  pSome concrete questionsp  ol liIs it correct that the standard parallel implementations interact with the fork join pool emsolelyem through the code in a hrefhttpwww.scalalang.orgapicurrentindex.htmlscala.collection.parallel.ForkJoinTasks relnofollowcodeForkJoinTaskscodeali liI see that theres an alternative trait, a hrefhttpwww.scalalang.orgapicurrentindex.htmlscala.collection.parallel.FutureThreadPoolTasks relnofollowcodeFutureThreadPoolTaskscodea.

But in my disconnected state it doesnt work, however, if the machine is connected it does work by downloading and caching the appropriate libraries from Adobe.  Unfortunately I need to deploy this Projector file as a single entity and often into disconnected scenarios.  Reviewing Flexs build options Ive selected Merged into code for the Framework Linkage that I assumed would create my single, deployable object but alas no.p  pIs there any way of compiling these RSLs into my deployable SWF  Projector without requiring an Internet Connectionp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 463 pIm looking for a data structure with the functionality of eg. the codeOrderedDictionarycode in .NET, that is to say an associative collection i.e. one that associates a emkeyem with a emvalueem that maintains element order just like a normal codeListcode does. p  pIt must have fast lookup by both index and key. It should also have a fast append operation inserting a new item at the end, and fast removal of items with any index based on either index or key.p  pThe codeOrderedDictionarycode in .NET uses both a hash table and an array to store its items if Im not mistaken. Retreiving an index based on a key or vice versa is therefore emOnem, and of course removal of an item from the middle of an array is emOnem to start with, plus the added lookup of the index from the key if removing by key.p  pMy question is if there exists a more efficient data structure that satisfies my conditions, or if this is indeed my best option herep

Negative 463 pIm designing a program now and Ive come across a UI issue. I want to have a bunch of different screens, yet I dont want to have to use 20 different forms Im pretty sure thats bad practice anyways, and I dont want to lay down all the controls at once in the designer because then things get messy. I had an idea of running a sub on startup that would dynamically generate all the controls I need with all the right coordinates and settings, and then dump al the ones needed for a specific screen into a Panel. Then I return an ArrayList of panels, and pull out the correct panel to attach to the form when I need that screen. The only problem is that my form will not have any implicit knowledge of its controls, so Im assuming I wouldnt be able to use the WithEvents  Handles. keywords to declare handlers in the form class which is what Id rather do. I know this sounds a little convoluted Im still trying to understand what Im saying  If anyone has any ideas about what way is better, or if theres a better one that I havent come across, let me know.p

Negative 463 pI think what I have may actually be a design issue rather than a technical issue, but either way Ive seem to a hit a wall in both my ability and understanding to get past this problem.p  pIm creating a reporting web page as part of a standard VB.NET web application. The page is data driven, with jquery making calls to a web service local to the application to get values of elements that are dynamically created in the DOM. Ultimately these dynamic elements and their values are all wrapped up in a JSON object, so that part of the client side is fine.p  pRight now, I can pass that JSON object to a method in the web service which creates an SQL Data adapter from the values and queries a database. My ultimate goal is to have this client JSON data be used to query the database and construct an excel file to send back to the user, or failing that a CSV file.p  pIts my understanding from working with PDF file generation that this type of function can only be done on the server side of the web application, not even from the web service i.e. I cant have the web service return an array of bytes and have JavaScriptjQuery present that as a file.p  pSo, how do I go about this Now I have my JSON object on the client side, where should I be sending it, how, and how do I go about returning my filep  pIve read about either storing the JSON in a hidden field and having the server take the elements value and go from there, or using AJAX to send the JSON to the server just before a postback is made to fire off the serverside function to run the query and return the data.p  pI just need a little guidance, and a little help understanding where to use the hidden field, or what I am actually doing with the prepostback AJAX call.p  pThanks.p

Negative 463 pJust developed a frontend almost entirely in FF 3.6. It works perfectly in IE9 even with lots of SVG, Opera, and Webkit, but is completely broken in FF9. Ive spent the entire day debugging it, and it looks like getBBox has broken somewhere along the line. There are possibly two separate issues, both related to getting a bounding box on a group containing multiple text elements, with rotated text, or text spread over multiple lines.p  pAnyone else seen this Ive got to say Im really, really, pissed off by this. Nothing in Bugzilla. If they didnt have such a moronic release cycle Id be tempted to go back and try an older version, but it seems a lot easier just to dump it...p  h2EDITh2  pHeres the answer, for anyone who comes by this way. Its basically to do with jQuery UI tabs, codedisplaynonecode, and dimensional computation, but the issue is that the workaround at jqueryui.com a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemostabs...myslider.2CGoogleMap.2CsIFRetc.notworkwhenplacedinahidden.28inactive.29tab.3F relnofollowherea is incomplete.p  p1  getBBox issues are generally due to a codedisplaynonecode somewhere, but my code didnt have an explicit codedisplaynonecode in itp  p2  FireFox is a lot more susceptible to displaygetBBox issues than other browsers. Oddly, FF 9.0.1 on Win7 is better than 9.0.1 on XPp  p3  the standard way to do dimensional computations in a hidden tab or hidden anything is to display offscreen see the link above, instead of applying codedisplaynonecodep  p4  Without the linked workaround above, FF throws an exception, Chrome gets the numbers wrong, Opera doesnt care, etcp  p5  But the workaround above offscreen display in code.uitabshidecode isnt sufficient. If you do this, but select the tab codetabsselectcode emafterem doing your dimensional computations, then FF can still get it wrong but it doesnt throw an exception. IE9, Opera, and Webkit are Ok.p  p6  I was wrong about FF 3.6  3.6Linux seems to behave the same as FF 9.0.1XPp  p7  short of digging into the tabs code, one fix is simply to select the tab before doing the dimensional computation. Ok for me, but would probably defeat the point of the exercise for most people.p  pChanged the subject to mention tabs.p

Negative 463 pIm working in a remote administration toy project. For now, Im able to capture screenshots and control the mouse using the codeRobotcode class. The screenshots are codeBufferedImagecode instances.p  pFirst of all, my requirements   Only a server and a client.   Performance is important, since the client might be an Android app.p  pIve thought on opening two socket connections, one for mouse and system commands and the second one for the video feed.p  pHow could I convert the screenshots to a video stream Should I convert them to a known video format or would it be ok to just send a series of serialized imagesp  pThe compression is another problem. Sending the screen captures in full resolution would result in a low frame rate, according to my preliminary tests. I think I need at least 24 fps to perceive movement, so Ive to both downscale and compress. I could convert the codeBufferedImagescode to jpg files and then set the compression rate, but I dont want to store the files on disk, they should live in RAM only. Another possibility would be to serialize instances representing an uncompressed screenshot to a GZipOutputStream. What is the correct approach for thisp  pTo summarizep  ul liIn case you recommend the series of images approach, how would you serialize them to the socket codeOutputStreamcodeli liIf your proposition is to convert to a know video format, which classes or libraries are availableli ul  pThanks in advance.p  pUPDATE my tests, client and server on same machinebr Full screen serialized BufferedImages only dimension, type and int[], without compression 1.9 fps.br full screen images through GZip streams 2.6 fps.br Downscaled images 640 width and GZip streams 6.56 fps.br Full screen images and RLE encoding 4.14 fps.br Downscaled images and RLE encoding 7.29 fps.p

Negative 463 pThe subject says it already p  pI am thinking right now about following designproblem I define an interface for a specific type of object that contains various methods. Now i have the problem, that different implementations of this interface, need additionaldifferent methodparameters because the way they are implemented makes this necessary, which i cannot incorporate into the interface because they are not common to emallem interfaceimplementations.p  pNow i realize that interface implementations could come with their own propertyfiles, loading their additional parameters from there, but what if these parameters need to be passed in at runtimep  pCurrently i can only think of passing in a codeMapltString, Objectgt parameterscode to overcome this problem  since JDKClasses like a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlparsersDocumentBuilderFactory.html relnofollowDocumentBuilderFactorya are doing something very similar by providing methods like codesetAttributeString attName, Object attValuecode this seems like a feasible approach to solve this problem. Nevertheless i would be interested in how others solve issues like this, alternative ideasp  pI dont want to derive from the interface and add additional methods, since in my case i would then have to throw codeNotImplementExceptioncode from the methods of the base interface.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWhat could be eventual problems of the Mapapproach Implementing classes are free to ignore it completely if they cant make use of additional parameters. Others might check if the Map contains the desired parameternames, check the type of their values and use them if valid, throw an exception if not. I have also seen this being used for the abstract class JAXBContext, so it seems to be a common approach..p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI decided to go for the mapapproach, since i dont see any obvious disadvantages and it is being used in the JDK as well yes, i know this does not necessarily mean much  Since i cannot accept an answer on this question, i will just upvote.

Negative 463 pstrongUpdate 2  Mystery Solvedstrongp  pI have figure out the issue  it was my misunderstanding of the keyword emstaticem when being use in java inner classes.  I assumed that static meant static in the traditional sense  as with c.  In the case of Java, static inner classes have a slightly different meaning.  I personally would have used a different keyword other than static to achieve the same effect to eliminate the confusion.  p  pHere are a couple good links that explain what static inner classes mean in java. p  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavajavaOOnested.html relnofollowlink1a a hrefhttpwww.javaworld.comjavaworldjavaqa19990801qastatic2.htmlpage1 relnofollowlink2ap  pSorry for sending everyone of a wild goose chase p  pstrongOriginal Poststrongp  pIn java I can write the followingp  precodepublic class UseStaticMembers      private Holder holder      holder.txt1  text     holder.txt2  text      CallSomeMethodholder    static class Holder      public string txt1     public string txt2  codepre  pBut I cannot do this in C.

Negative 463 pJust a thing Ive been thinking of for a while.

Negative 463 pI am in need of a class that mimics a TextBox control but is not a Control, but instead a custom drawn component or element.p  pCreating one feels like reinventing the wheel since I see them everywhere.  For example, in any modern web browser the text boxes are not controls.  Most Winforms controls, especially ToolStrip controls such as ToolStripTextBox, have elements which behave like text boxes but are not Controls.p  pI assume that Microsoft doesnt reinvent the wheel for each control they make it.  But most likely their code is proprietary and not public.p  pDoes any one know of an open source solution for this  I am experienced with GDI drawing but a text field is not a trivial task when you consider caret positioning, selection, and inserting text.p  pAny pointers on how to go about writing the code myself would be appreciated, such as how to calculate the character at a given point.  Should I create a lookup table for the measured width of each possible character  Or loop through MeasureString to take into account formatting spacep

Negative 463 pI work for a fairly new web development company and we are currently testing subversion installations to implement a versioning system. One of the features we need the versioning system to perform is to update the development server with an edited file once it has been committed. p  pWe would like to maintain one server for all of our SVN repositories, even though, due to system requirements, we need to maintain several separate development servers. I understand that the updates are fairly simple when the development server resides in the same location as SVN, but that is just not possible for us.

I dont know the hex values well enough to see them and know off hand its red or a flavor of it, green, blue, etc.p  pWould it make sense to have a comment at the top that is a color reference for the given sitep  pExamplep  precode  [Site Name] Color Standards  Red   Specific hexvalue for shade of red being used.  White FFF or FFFFFF  Black 000 or 000000  Yellow Specific hexvalue for shade of yellow being used.  and so on...  codepre  pI have not seen that in any of stylesheet examples around the web or anywhere else.  As one who does not work with stylesheets on an as needed basis, I think this would be a good standard.  I will certainly use it going forward.  I would understand why someone who works with them constantly would find this useless and would not do it.  p  pEdit In response to comments I poorly chose to have black and white in there as part of the example, but what I was getting at is why isnt done as a standard.  The design document may not always be available but I agree that it should.  I wrote this after I started doing web development which is new to me and I just thought that something like this would make sense so that emanyoneem could come into the stylesheet know what colors to use to keep the colors on the site consistent.  If something like this were done, there would be no need to rely on an additonal resource the original designer who might have moved on, design document which may or may not be available, or anybody else in the officeon the team.p

Negative 463 pIm trying to calculate the distance between two geographical coordinates in PHP Im aware this has been covered many times before, bear with me.

It turns out that if I hardcode the latitude and longitude values in as floats my results match the expected distances, but if I use the string values retrieved from the database Im a couple of percent out.p  pI have echoed out the values to check theyre not being truncated or anything daft like that and they look fine.

Now I want to put this thing inside other tabs and whatnot across the app. This looks like a candidate for abstraction rather than copypaste.p  pWhats killing me is should I package all this functionality logic to showhideswap buttons, record sound, analyze sound levels together into a widget If so, how many classes should I use and which classes should each subclass And lastly, in Interface Builder which object should I drag onto my storyboard inside the tab and which of my classes should I type into the Custom Class box.p

That would both exclude all users who require binary only packages and just simply be really inefficient. p  pAnd 1 seems technically possible, but as a hrefhttplists.rforge.rproject.orgpipermailrcppdevel2012July004026.html relnofollowdiscussed on the Rcpp mailing lista, it is not worth implementing a set of automagic converter functions. p  pSo, the question p  pstrongCan someone please give a walkthrough of the correct way to take the provided example code and turn it into an R packagestrong p  pThere is just a bit too much newness for me to make sense of the existing documentation. FWIW, Im sure it would be helpful for people in the future p

Negative 463 pWe are going to develop a huge webapp coded in Java EE technology for our client. My client doesnt support ANT and Eclipse which are OSS in their servers. p  pSo our requirement is to code and develop the application in our local system and test it, then we need to supply the source code in the client server where we will run a deployment script which will compile the required java files from the source files and deploy the .class files and other resource files to Tomcat running on that server HPUX.p  pIs it possible to use just javac, jar or other commands available in JAVAHOMEbin to deploy an application with out using ANT scripts If there is any such implementation could you please guide us I wonder before ANT was developed, how JAVA developers used to deploy big applications. I came to know that MAKE command available in our server is not good for java applications.p  pNote We will be having complex package hierarchy up to 4 levelsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong It looks like I dont have a straight forward answer. I would like to persuade our client to use ANT. If not I will develop a cross platform custom build tool for my client based up on the comments below... Thanks guys..

Negative 463 pSo, to do much of anything useful with leaderboard data, one must first fetch an array of codeGKScorecodes from codeGKLeaderboardcode and then fetch the corresponding codeGKPlayercodes for each score. p  pOnce you have that, you might want to have a dictionary mapping the players to scores or the scores to players or codeplayerIDcodes to score codevaluecodes or some such. And itd be nice to set up such a dictionary using code[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsforKeys]code since we already have arrays. p  pThe question is are these arrays emguaranteedem to be in the same order i.e. is it safe to do the followingp  precodeGKLeaderboard leaderboard  [[GKLeaderboard alloc] init] [leaderboard loadScoresWithCompletionHandlerNSArray scores, NSError error      NSArray playerIDs  [scores valueForKeyplayerID]     [GKPlayer loadPlayersForIdentifiersplayerIDs withCompletionHandlerNSArray players, NSError error          self.scores  [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsscores forKeysplayers]     ] ] codepre  pError handling and ARC safety ommitted for brevity.p  pI know code[scores valueForKeyplayerID]code will get me an array of codeplayerIDcodes in the same order as the scores  thats what codevalueForKeycode on an array is supposed to do. But does the completion handler from codeloadPlayerscode guarantee that the array of fetched player scores will be in the same order as the input Ive created a few sandbox accounts and done a few tests, and it appears that the sort order always matches, but thats no guarantee.p  pThe documentation doesnt say anything either way. It does say the array may contain partial results in the case of an error, in which case it obviously wont map to the input, but what about the noerror case Its pretty simple to sort both arrays on codeplayerIDcode, of course, but itd be a shame to have to spend time sorting an array if itll always be already sorted.p

Negative 463 pIm at the investigative stage for Workflow Service and WPF.p  pHaving State Machine WF Service hosted in IIS and one or more WPF clients talking to the WF Service sounds reasonable choice so far.p  pHowever, although days of reading and research it isnt clear to me what would be the best strategy for tracking the transfer between states from WPF app.p  pTherere numerous samples of tracking participants but most of them are based on One process scenario. p  pSo I am thinking of a structure as below.p  ol liA serverside WCF operation that any client calls to register its clientside endpointli liA custom tracking participant that goes through all registered clientside endpoints and sends TrackingRecord at its Track method.li ol  pAdvantage of this approach is that it allows real time update of the states without extra layers like ETW. Another advantage is that it allows decoupling of the logic or maybe model layer from the presentation layer.p  pCan anyone share the opinion over the above structure I would also welcome any suggestions for achieving the goal.p  hr  p[EDIT] To make my idea above more detailed and clear, below steps would be a typical usage.p  p1 WPF client contains and opens a WCF endpoint for receiving TrackRecords.p  p2 WF Service opens a WCF operation or a simple WF instance with a Receive message that registers clientside address to an internal store.p  p3 WF Service a custom tracking participant is created and added that will send TrackingRecord to the registered clients endpoints.p  p4 client connects to the above service and hands out clientside endpoint mentioned at step 1 and consequently receives TrackingRecords.p  hr  p[ EDIT 2 ]p  pTo put my goal in simple terms, Id like to knowp  p1 the most efficient way of tracking the StateMachines state on a WF Service IIS  WPF or any types of client app through TrackingParticipant.p  p2 if my suggestion can be improvedp  pMeanwhile, I have implemented this and works good so far. I also added MvvM Light frameworks messaging feature at the clientside so that it propagate the received message to the models easily.p

Negative 463 pRight now, Im working on a project, and my setup is something like this I have a class codeFoocode which has several methods inside of it which must be activated at different times by the main class. p  pIve been researching this for quite a while, and the only thing I can find is the codeTimercode class, which doesnt quite work, as it can seemingly only time a class, and I dont want 25 different classes for such a basic program. p  pHow do I activate each method in codeFoocode individuallyp

Negative 463 pIve made a simple PHP jQuery Chat Application with Short Polling AJAX Refresh. Like, every 2  3 seconds it asks for new messages. But, I read that Long Polling is a better approach for Chat applications. So, I went through some Long Polling scripts. I made like thisp  h2Javascripth2  precodesubmit.clickfunction     .ajax         url chathandler.php,         dataType json,         data action  read, message  message        var getNewMessage  function      .ajax         url chathandler.php,         dataType json,         data action  read, message  message,         functiondata             alertdata                    getNewMessage   document.readygetNewMessage codepre  h2PHPh2  precodeltphp     time  time     while time  time lt 25          data  dbgtgetNewMessage           if empty data              echo jsonencode data             break                   usleep1000000  1 Second      gt codepre  pThe problem is, once codegetNewMessagecode starts, it executes unless it gets some response from chathandler.php. It executes recursively. But if someone wants to send a message in between, then actually that function codesubmit.clickcode never executes as codegetNewMessagecode is still executing. So is there any workaroundp

Negative 463 pI know it is not possible for an html form to have two actions, but maybe there is a better way for me to accomplish what I need. I have a simple form that collects the users email address and signs them up for a Constant Contact email list. In addition, the email is submitted to another controller which displays a thank you message that contains the email variable from the form. I can accomplish both of these things separately but cannot get them to work in sync with each other since the form information is being sent to thankyou and the Constant Contact site. Im sure there is a way for me to send this data to Constant Contact via the thankyou controller, I am just not sure how to do that.p  pAlso, I cannot use ajax with this because I need to show a different page on submit to track how many times the thank you page has been viewed.p

Negative 463 pIn the Chapter 7.3.5 Inheritance and Instance Variables of the book the ruby programing language says p  blockquote   pBecause instance variables have nothing to do with   inheritance, it follows that an instance variable used by a subclass cannot shadow an   instance variable in the superclass. If a subclass uses an instance variable with the same   name as a variable used by one of its ancestors, it will strongoverwritestrong the value of its ancestors   variable. This can be done intentionally, to alter the behavior of the ancestor, or it can   be done inadvertently. In the latter case, it is almost certain to cause bugs. As with the   inheritance of private methods described earlier, this is another reason why it is only   safe  to  extend  Ruby  classes  when  you  are  familiar  with  and  in  control  of  the   implementation of the superclass.p blockquote  pI had made my own test , but seems instance variables from subclass does NOT affect the superclass p  pmy Ruby versionp  precodebobbobruby ruby version ruby 1.9.3p194 20120420 revision 35410 [i686linux] bobbobruby  codepre  pBelow is the codep  precodeclass Point    attraccessor x,y    def initializex,y      x,yx,y    end end  class Point3D lt Point    attraccessor x,y,z    def initializex,y,z      xx      yy      zz    end end  irbmain0520gt pPoint.new1,2 gt ltPoint0x87e8968 x1, y2gt irbmain0530gt qPoint3D.new4,5,6 gt ltPoint3D0x87e423c x4, y5, z6gt irbmain0540gt q.x gt 4 irbmain0550gt p.x gt 1 irbmain0560gt  codepre

Everything works fine but i want to call this method only when i finish typing all 4 digits but here the method is called when i try to enter 4th digit.p  pHow can i perform this where i type in 2000 and it will call the method after shouldChangeCharactersInRange return Yes after entering 3rd zero.p  pHeres my codep  precode BOOLtextFieldUITextField textField shouldChangeCharactersInRangeNSRangerange replacementStringNSString string      NSString substring  [NSString stringWithStringtextField.text]     substring  [substring stringByReplacingCharactersInRangerange withStringstring]      if filteredarray count1 and substring and filteredarray object at index 0 matches then call a method here       return YES  codepre

Then another record is written in the status table for when it is in progress StatusType 1.  And also when the service order is closed, another record written in the status table StatusType 3.  There are also other status types that may happen, but these are the most common.  The data in the SOSTATUS table looks like thisp  precodeid            Date                JobID  StatusTypeID  EmployeeID 1     20120101 090500.000       51        2             5 2     20120101 100000.000       52        2            12 3     20120101 100100.000       51        1             5 4     20120101 121500.000       53        2             8 5     20120101 121600.000       51        3             5 6     20120101 130000.000       52        1            12 7     20120101 140000.000       52        3            12 8     20120101 141500.000       53        1             8 9     20120101 150000.000       54        2            11 10    20120101 163000.000       53        3             8 11    20120101 150000.000       54        1            11 12    20120101 163000.000       54        3            11 codepre  pI need to be able to find the time elapsed between each status change of each JobID.

The only other similar question I have found is a year old, had no solution, and can be found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10784329springsourcetoolsuiteskippingcodesherea.p  pThe best guess I have so far is that the debugger is displaying the text I have typed in, but is actually executing an older version of the class file which it has cached somewhere.

It uses a script to pipe commands to the openssl but which then enters an infinite loop to keep stdin open until it receives a signal to tell it to quit.  Here is my test scriptp  precodebinsh  if [ 1  doit ] then    trap echo 04 logout exit SIGUSR1    echo 00 login USERNAME PASSWORD    echo 01 SELECT PID    echo 02 SELECT FOLDER    echo 03 FETCH 1 BODY[HEADER.FIELDS Subject]    while  do  done fi  MYFLAG 0 doit  openssl sclient crlf connect server993 2gtdevnull  while read LINE do    LINEecho LINE  tr d r    [ LINE04   OK ] ampamp MYFLAGY     [ LINE033  01 NO Mailbox doesnt exist PID ] ampamp PIDLINEPID    [ MYFLAG ] ampamp echo LINE    [ PID a LINE  03 OK Fetch completed. ] ampamp kill USR1 PID done echo Finished. codepre  pThe script calls itself with a parameter to output the IMAP commands which is piped to openssl, whose output is piped into a codereadcode loop so it can be processed.  The MYFLAG variable is just used to hide the information output by openssl and just echo the output from the server connection.p  pI select a dummy folder name which includes the PID of the second instance of the script as a way to pass this back, obviously a temporary file would have been better but for the testing I wanted to keep everything self contained and be able to watch what was happening.p  pOnce the fetch information has been displayed and the server returns the OK response, it sends a SIGUSR1 signal to the second instance of the script, that then sends the logout message and quits, closing stdin which causes sclient to disconnect.p  pOriginally I included the code04 logoutcode command in the initial set of echos, but when I did this the read loop only displayed as far as the fetch output then stalled, it did not even show the OK status for the operation, though everything was received.p  pAlso I need to use codetrcode to strip trailing carriage returns, but if I pipe the output from openssl through then nothing is received by the read loop.p

Negative 463 pSo, I have a Django view, which is based on codedjango.views.generic.Viewcode, which accepts only codePOSTcode requests. It takes basic calls in an codeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedcode format, parses them, and then responds as appropriate. I realise this is failing on the idea of skinny controller, fat model, but Im not sure as to the best location to place the following logic, as it is related to the view, rather than specifically to the underlying model.p  pAt present, the view handles some logic to create new subscriptionsp  precodeclass ExampleViewView     def postself, request, args, kwargs         mode  request.POST.getmode          if not mode             return HttpResponsemode required, status400          if mode  subscribe             if not request.POST.gettopic                 return HttpResponsetopic required, status400              if not [ another required argument ]                 and so on ...              [ If were ready to roll, create a Subscription object ]              return HttpResponseSubscribed, status200 codepre  pSo, this appears to me like putting the logic in the wrong layer. Where would be the best place to process what is being passed to the View, and to generatefail to generate Subscription objects as appropriate. p  pShould the processing of the provided data happen on the Subscription object, which then returns HttpResponses to the view Or should it just return status and messages, which are then relayed to the user by the view creating the correct HttpResponse objectp

Negative 463 pI just started working with uploading files via php.p  pFrom my understanding you need to set the properties of the folder to 777 so anyone can upload to that location.p  pThats fine and i only obviously keep information there that is not sensitive, its basically images which are displayed back to the public.p  pHowever can someone not just run a delete statement if they know the image name to my server folder or is that only possible if the php file is on my serverp  pi.e delete myimage.pngp  pBasically my question is other than the normal security precautions like limiting the upload of only .png, using basename etc do i need to take additional security measures to prevent someone deleting files in that folder or can that only be done from a script on my webserverp  pI wont be using any post methods to delete images or anything like that but im just not sure if its possible to take advantage of a folder with 777 permission and do unauthorized stuff since i gave full access to the folder. p

Negative 463 pI have been reading a lot onlineoffline about where to put validation and business rules in general for domain driven design. What I could not understand is how can an entity provides methods that does validation and business rules without resorting to static methods or having a service This is especially important for cases where the domain object does not need to be instantiate yet, but we need to validate a value that will eventually used to set the objects attribute.p  pI noticed blog postings such as a hrefhttplostechies.comjimmybogard20071024entityvalidationwithvisitorsandextensionmethods relnofollowhttplostechies.comjimmybogard20071024entityvalidationwithvisitorsandextensionmethodsa relies on .NETs specific extension method, which is not available in programming languages such as Java. I personally dont like static methods are they cannot be overridden and hard to test.p  pIs there anyway I could do this without static methods or having to instantiate an unnecessary domain object just to use its validation and business rules methods. If not, does that mean domain driven design is very dependent on static methodsp  pThanksp

Negative 463 pI have written an application in VB 2010 that generates log files, and I wanted to add a feature to view the log files without leaving the app. This was done, naturally, by adding a form with a text box and loading in the file.p  pSometimes these files get plenty big, so I was looking for a way to just show the most recent entries  i.e., the last few lines. I got that figured out using a pretty cool method that works really fast without iterating through all the lines of text.p  pJust to make it convenient, I wanted to make it display the very bottom of the text box, so ScrollToCaret was employed. However, in this particular text box, the ScrollToCaret function didnt work, no matter how I tried to implement it. If I use a RichTextBox, it works fine, and if thats what I need to do, thats how Ill do it. But I have to know why it wouldnt work in a regular text box.p  pHeres my codep  precode    Dim intLineCount As Int64  IO.File.ReadAllLinesstrFileName.Length     Dim intStartPosition As Int64  intLineCount  1000     Dim intPositionLoop As Int64     Try          Dim strAllLines As String  File.ReadAllLinesstrFileName         For intPositionLoop  intStartPosition To intLineCount             txtViewLogs.AppendTextstrAllLinesintPositionLoop  1 amp vbNewLine          Next     Catch ex As Exception      End Try     txtViewLogs.Focus     txtViewLogs.ScrollToCaret codepre  pAs this shows, this will display the last 1000 lines of the log file. When the file is completely loaded, the caret is already at the end of the file, so there was no need to set the codeSelectionStartcode point to the end of the file, but I even tried that, and no luck.p  pIn order to eliminate the possibility that some property of the text box could have been accidentally changed, I deleted the text box and added another one, taking care not to make any accidental changes to the properties.p  pAnyone have any idea why its like this As I said, if I have to stick with a rich text box, thats what Ill do, but it kills me not knowing why this is doing that. I know Ive used this in other applications, but I cant see why it wont work with this one.p

Negative 463 pI have an codeNgComponentcode in Angular Dart which instantiates a search box and according to the query strings it populates another div in my html template with the codengrepeatcode directive.p  pMore precisely, p  pQuery string update there is a binding to the input text value with a field in my components controller. p  pResults population In the codeattachcode method I added a watcher for the local field which acts as a model to the input box, and whenever it changes I add to a local list some items which then acts as a model to the codengrepeatcode directive in another div.p  pSo far everything works fine. But now I want to add some event listeners inside my component, like keystroke listeners or if possible to add listeners on specific elements in my html template. I have used CSS for hover and focus events and also codengfocuscode and codengblurcode for easy functions. But I do not think that this can be used for keystroke listeners.p  pThe reason I want the keystroke listener is to enable results traversing using the arrow keys. While the cursor is inside the input text box I would like to move to the first result, which is in another div, with the press of Down arrow, and then continue to the other results.p  pThank you p

Negative 463 pso I have an array of points that show a dottodot of various letters. This was done with bezier calculation on the lettersWhich Im not terribly familiar with. p  pMy problem is that I now need to make an equal distance between each point of the array. So rather gaps on the straight section and many points on tight curves. I instead need one uniform unit every set distanceLets say 5 pixels. So using the original Array how can I set an equal spacing between the pointsp  pIve been ceaselessly amazing myself with how many wrong answers I can come up with. p

Negative 463 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am building a multitenant approx. 100 paying clients Customer Relationship Management application for a specific industry niche.  The CRM will store data about my clients prospects and customers or rather, contacts.  The data that will be stored will be a combination of known  standard data Id, Name, Address, Phone, etc. and configurable  dynamic data defined by each client.  In other words, there will be a form builder allowing my clients to add more data about each contact.  Furthermore, they will need to be able to import both the standard and dynamic data from legacy systems.  The key requirement in addition to searching through the standard data, clients should be able to search through dynamic data to find matches to queries, or even create reports that include  summed  grouped by this dynamic data.p  pI would prefer to use Microsoft Azure since I am a C developer and have some familiarity with the user interface, even if Im not widely experience in all the tools Azure has to offer.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pMy hope was to use reflection emit to create instances of dynamic classes representing contacts with both standard and dynamic properties, then serialize those instances into JSON and into Azure Blobs.

Negative 463 pIm not familiar with responsive websites and would like to start creating a website taking all the screens into account.p  pObviously media queries is the way to go but they only concern CSS.p  pIn my current project, I would like to organise the page differently according to the width of the page being completely device agnostic. The thing is, on small widths, I would like the HTML layout to change completely so I will have to make the HTML responsive as well as it should change according to the website width.p  pHow can I achieve that Is there any js library jQuery if possible but not mandatory that will serve another html page according to the width of the pagep  pThe whole website should be build this way so the script should be more than a gadget, it should be rock solid enough to allow the whole website to rely on it. And, of course, it should work on any device or screen or browser.p  pSome would say that Im looking for adaptive techniques more than responsive ones but I believe its a mix between those two as the elements will still be responsive in general but between some critical breakpoints, it will indeed adapt and change the html.p  pI read a lot about different techniques but I cant find something that suits my needs. Any lead would be appreciated.p  pThank you for your help. p

That is, until there is some allocation happening in part c. p  pWhen the GC decides to cleanup the minor heap, the double pointer may become invalid. Since this can only happen to parameters in b, Id like to signal the GC do whatever you want, but never move the content in these blocks until I tell you so. Is there a way to achieve this using the OCaml API p

Negative 463 pI have a few basic trigonometry questions that will probably make you laugh when I ask them, but because Im a strongwilled individual, Im going to ask them anyway So, math is not my forte. I suck at it. I sucked at it in high school. I didnt even touch it in college. And I try my best to steer clear of it now. However, Im a developer, so it rears its ugly head almost on a deldailydel hourly basis. Let me tell you about my current situation.p  pI have an analog clock that Im drawing entirely in code. Ive read up on all sorts of fun trig stuff and scary functions like codeatan2code, and Ive actually got a clock that changes with the time. Its pretty cool.

Negative 463 pIm slowly moving a legacy FileMaker application to Rails 4.1. To do that Im in the process of creating a simple Rails JSON API to keep the FileMaker application which is still being used and Rails data in sync.p  pTo simplify things Id like to make use of nested JSON resources where possible  e.g. Creating  updating a contact should automatically include its addresses and other data from related tables. Otherwise Id have to jump to related records in FileMaker and initialize separate API requests, which is a rather slow process in FileMaker. Handling this in one request is prefered.p  pOf course its important to keep the IDs of those existing FileMaker records, which is why they have to be set in those API requests. However it turns out that nested resources in JSON requests that have an ID set automatically trigger an update action for those nested models. Lets look at an example like this small piece of JSONp  precode     id 7777     name John Doe     addresses [              id 123,         name John Doe,         address Some Street 12         city Sampletown         ...     ,          id 654,         name Jane Doe,         address Some other address         city Maybe in another city         ...     ]  codepre  pIf I wanted to push this contact and its addresses from FileMaker to Rails via API request Rails will look for existing addresses with the IDs of 123 and 654 instead of creating new ones with those IDs.p  pI know this intended by Rails and if I wanted those addresses to be created Id have to post them without IDs, but as mentioned before its important to keep the IDs since they are used for all kinds of relations within the application like order billing and delivery addresses. This behaviour also only seems to apply to nested data. The parent object can be created just fine with any ID.p  pOf course I could just post addresses as first level parent objects in several requests but that would require a lot of jumping around in FileMaker, so if anyone is aware of a way to avoid the default Rails behaviour when it comes to post requests and nested attributes with a fixed ID, Id be glad to hear it.p

Negative 463 pAVX allow for bitwise logical operations such as andor on floating point datatype m256 and m256d. p  pHowever, C doesnt allow for bitwise operations on floats and doubles, reasonably. If Im right, theres no guarantee on the internal representation of floats, whether the compiler will use IEEE754 or not, hence a programmer cant be sure about how the bits of a float will look like.p  pConsider this examplep  precodeinclude ltimmintrin.hgt include ltiostreamgt include ltlimitsgt include ltcassertgt  int main       float x[8]  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8     float mask[8]  1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0     float xmasked[8]      assertstdnumericlimitsltfloatgtisiec559      m256 x  mm256loadpsx     m256 mask  mm256loadpsmask      m256 xmasked  mm256andpsx,mask      mm256storepsxmasked,xmasked      forint i  0 i lt 8 i         stdcout ltlt xmasked[i] ltlt        return 0  codepre  pAssuming that IEEE754 is used, as the representation of 1 is 0xffffffff, I would expect the output to be p  precode1,0,0,4,0,6,0,0 codepre  pwhile its insteadp  precode1 0 0 1.17549e38 0 1.17549e38 0 0 codepre  pHence my assumption about the internal representation was probably wrong or I made some silly mistake.p  pSo the question is is there a way in which I can use floating point logical and be safe about the fact that the result will make sensep

Negative 463 pSuppose Im writing a container class codetemplate lttypename Tgt class MyContainercode and for some reason I would like to pass objects of type codeTcode with their type hidden from the user.

Also, Im not sure if the compiler will optimize away the HidesType completely. p  pThe problem with the second is that I dont know if the reinterpretcast is safe e.g. wont there be any alignment issues.p  pThe problem with the third is that codeTcode might be marked codefinalcode and HidesTypeamp converts to Tamp implicitly.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThe main purpose of hiding is to make codeHidesTypecode abstract and distinguishable from codeTcode.

Negative 463 pIm having a problem updating nodes in my force layout. I have used some help from another stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21070899d3jshowtoremovenodeswhenlinkdataupdatesinaforcelayoutposta for updating nodes. This worked out fine until I realized that everythingcircle svg, lines, text, etc were under their own g tag.p  pSo that means that I cannot manipulate any of the text like I did before.   If you compare a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netclanofnoobsnjyojesa relnofollowthisa   with a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netclanofnoobstnrctL8s relnofollowthisa you can see that in the first fiddle, I cant increase the text size based on the click. coded3.selectthis.selecttextcode does not work since the g tags do not include a circle and a text together.p  pSo I need to be able to manipulate the text in correspondence to the node. The second fiddle handles that but it has a problem updating the nodes. If you hit the update button, it updates all the nodes but it does not remove existing nodes. For the first fiddle, update works fine but i cant manipulate the text like I mentioned earlier. So for a solution, I need to either find a way to manipulate the text in the first fiddle, or for the second fiddle, I need to somehow have it properly update all the nodes on exit. I would say the second fiddle would be more natural to work with since the nodes are set out in a structured layout. i.e, each circle and its corresponding text are in g tags just like what you would group in divs. p

Negative 463 pWhile Debugging I have some PDFFiles in AppData folder of my WebSite in production the files are located somewhere else because I want to avoid that they are getting deployed. Inside the code I can access and manipulate the files. But if I want to open them in a new browser window e.g. via JavaScript, Im getting an Error 404.0. The URL is correct and also the displayed physical filesystem path. So I think it may be an issue of the IIS Express I have already removed the appdata tag in applicationhost.config from the hiddenSegments section. Is there something else I could configure to get the problem solvedp

Negative 463 pIm using a PivotGrid to display string values as my Data area value. My first problem was that, because the data value is a string, all cells contained zeros when the pivot is performed. However, I fixed that by changing the column aggregate type to max from sum.p  pNow, my problem. I have a SQL proc that takes a type parameter and returns a list of possible values for the type. Each column in the pivotgrid is one of these types. I am showing only the string value of the type, but I have the int value which needs to be passed to the proc in the grids datasource as well as a separate field. Now, I can have any number of columns, and would need to be able to edit a cell with a LookUpEdit repository item. The list of values returned for each cell would be dictated by the column Im busy with. Therefore, I need to dynamically create lookupedits for each cell on the fly, passing the cells type ID through as a parameter to correctly fill the dropdown.p  pIm able to do that, but there is no link between the ID in the lookup and the ID on the grid. When I drop down, I can select a value from the lookup, but I dont know how to bind the value I selected to the specific field in the grids datasource the cells value just switches back to what it was before I dropped down. I think the main problem is that Im displaying the string value in the data area of the grid and not a numeric value. The users of this screen will need the string value to know what theyre doing, and will need to be able to select a new string value from the lookups to edit the underlying tables int value.p  pI hope this is clear enough. If you need any more detail, please feel free to ask.p  pThanksp

Negative 463 pI am working on a .Net software product that consists of multiple applications of various sizes and dozens potentially hundreds of assemblies. Everything must be translated into several languages.p  pWhereever I look, the suggested way to localize strings in .NET is to create satellite assemblies with resource strings. Of course, all those examples simply show one assembly, and how to make localization work technically. My problem is, that in practice strongI dont see how this should scale to a large set of assembliesstrong.p  pIf i simply duplicate the approach for each assembly I end up with a really big number of satellite assemblies to maintain and deploy, and I have to keep track of one and the same stringtranslation in every assembly that requires it. Everytime a translation changes, I have to locate all uses of this string throughout all my assemblies, and modify it. p  pEverytime I need to update my translations, I need to extract everything from the multitude of resource files, send it to the translators, and then spread their results again to the correct resources. This can be done of course, and I assume some of it can and must be scripted. However, it doesnt strike me as especially emsmoothem and efficient.p  pOne alternative I can think of is to create a dedicated translation assembly with satellite assemblies that serves as a central repository for localized strings. All translations of all strings of all assemblies would go there, and it would be referenced by each and every assembly in turn to spit out the translations. p  pThis seems to make maintenance a lot easier, but of course this central assembly with its enormous set of resource strings would have to be deployed alongside even the smallest of my applications which actually would need only a tiny fraction of them. Moreover, this assembly would have to be frequently changed by many developers which would lead to a high risk of conflicts.p  pMy question isbr   How is the approach of localization via satellite assemblies supposed to scale to large software projects with many assemblies What are the suggested strategies and best practicesp

Negative 463 pIm trying to submit a jsf hform from another webpage a plain html page without any dynamic. Im doing this because I have a web page which is devided into two parts. A static html part with contentsonly and a dynamic part with some simple jsf forms contact form in this case. But the footer of my static pages should contain a contact form. So I want to submit a users input from the static footer to the dynamic jsf page. It would be entirely sufficient if this form just copies the fieldnames and action url of my jsf contact form. The jsf app will take care of validation and actionprocessing. p  pWhen I go the my jsf form and copy the whole  part using firebug and submit i from a static html page everything works fine at first. But later on I guess after my session is expired the form is not submitted or filled with the values anymore. I do get redirected to the correct page but the form does not process anything.p  pMaybe there is a certain sessionbound parameter present somewhere in one of the formfields or a binding of some sort tying all http requests of the jsf form together.p  pSo this is my question Is there a way to submit a jsf hform from a simple html pagep  pThanks and regards Sebastianp

Negative 463 pI am trying to parse stanford nlp trees and use them in a python script. For the syntactic analysis i am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comdasmithstanfordcorenlppython relnofollowthisa. It is set as a client server interface which is leaving the stanford parser to run within java in the server and the client side receives the parsed data. The problem appears when the tree is parsed for ussage in the client end though. They are using nltk trees for that and they are missing a lot of methods that the nlp.tree provides.p  precodenlp  StanfordNLP result  nlp.parseHello world  It is so beautiful. pprintresult  from nltk.tree import Tree tree  Tree.parseresult[sentences][0][parsetree] pprinttree codepre  pIs there an implementation of nlp trees within nltk or an other python library i can use I really want to avoid going through all the code and making it fit.p

I tried the following variationsp  precodeINSERT INTO LIBNAME.TestTable Statuscode, EnteredDate, LastUpdateDate VALUES 2, ampsysdate9000000dt,ampsysdate9000000dt codepre  pThis method does not enter the time only the date and the date entered is wrong as well.

Negative 463 pI have a wordpress 4.0 website that I am working on that has a regular blog and a video section. Right now I am using the post categories News, Blog, Episodes, Documentaries, amp Trailers. The first two show up on the blog page and the last three show up on a video page. What I would like to do is create a new tab using everything in the Post tab but call it Videos. This would give the client another seperate place to post videos and blogs. They would each have their own set of categories.p  pI could then use this to search just that taxonomy video posts or blog posts. I have seen this done is some portfolio plugins.p  pDoes anyone either know how I can get started doing this myself or if there is an existing plugin out there that will do thisp  pThanks,p  pMattp

For example if the dice roll returns 1, I would do something like frequency.at0.

Negative 463 pI have been using the ffmpeg libraries libavcodec, libavformat, etc. in my C application to encode buffer data retrieved from my cameramicrophone using DirectShow.Net and stream it over the network to a destination IP address using MPEGTS and UDP. p  pI communicate with the C libraries of ffmpeg through a C wrapper .dll which I call with DllImport. I send the raw video and audio buffer data from C to the C libraries for the purpose of encoding, muxing, and streaming.p  pThe encoding and streaming works perfectly, however I sometimes seem to encounter a problem with the avwriteframe function which is used to write the encoded packet to the output media. After a seemingly random period of time, the following line produces an error oc being the AVFormatContext and pkt being the AVPacketp  blockquote   pavwriteframeoc, amppktp blockquote  pOne of two errors occursp  ul liAn IO error is returned return value 5.li liA System.AccessViolationException Attempted to read or write protected memory.

Also, this error occurs at both video and audio encodingwriting, so I havent been able to pinpoint the exact reason behind this problem. Unfortunately it always results in my application either crashing or the streaming to stop working. p  pI have tried catching the AccessViolationException, which sometimes allows the application to continue for a little longer, but eventually it ends up exiting without any warning.  In case of the IO error, I can reset my application, but eventually it still crashes. p  pAny help with fixing this issue would be greatly appreciatedp  pThank you very much in advance.p

Negative 463 pI am working on a Django web application for writing a basic querying and reporting tool for a large dataset derived from the GAP computer algebra system www.gapsystem.org.  Currently this is at its very early stages, the Github repo is here a hrefhttpsgithub.comsrmurthyTPP relnofollowhttpsgithub.comsrmurthyTPPa.p  pThe dataset is currently in the form of several HTML tables, and I estimate that there are roughly about 810 million records.  Each record displays some numerical parameters about certain mathematical objects which are associated with finite groups of order up to 1000, one record per group.  Using a Python parser this data will be extracted from the tables and stored in a relational database SQLite.p  pTechnically thats not a problem, but in thinking about how to store relevant fields about groups, the problem arises as to how to define a primary key for a table about groups based on the GAP representation of groups in its small groups library a hrefhttpwww.icm.tubs.deagalgebrasoftwaresmallREADME relnofollowhttpwww.icm.tubs.deagalgebrasoftwaresmallREADMEa, which is a collection of groups of small order.  There is no publicly visible unique object ID I could use in GAP.  In the small groups library groups are given an ID which is of the form [N,M] where N is the order of the group and M is the index of that particular group in the collection of groups of that order.  So the group Sym3 group of permutations of degree 3 has the GAP ID [6,1] etc.  But this is a logical ID not an object ID, and in the case where I need to distinguish between the isomorphic subgroups of Sym3 generated by the transpositions 1,2, 1,3, 2,3, it will fail because the GAP IDs of these subgroups are all identical, i.e. if I need to store a record for the triple S,T,U associated with the group Sym3, where S  subgroup generated by 1,2, T  subgroup generated by 1,3, U  subgroup generated 2,3, then I need to be able to have unique IDs that I can associate with S, T, U as distinct GAP objects.p  pI dont know the specifics of how GAP stores groups, but there is OpenMath functionality in GAP a hrefhttpgapsystem.orgManualspkgopenmathdocchap0.htmlcontents relnofollowhttpgapsystem.orgManualspkgopenmathdocchap0.htmlcontentsa.  If I understand correctly this functionality allows me to extract objects from GAP into a platform independent way, either XML or binary OMPrint, OMString, OMPut seem to be some relevant functions in GAP, but it is unclear how I still need to think about how to write to and extract the objects from the relational database.  I dont have any experience of using OpenMath in this context, and was wondering whether anyone has advice in this regard.p

Negative 463 pIm searching for help with my websocket problem. I have built a simple HTML5 websocket to connect between my AngularJSSite websocket connects through simple JS and my PHPServer. The connection works as well, and also sending and recieving data works as well. The reason, why I need a websocket is I have a diferent RESTService PHP at the same server, which also communicates with the AngularJSSite. So the RESTService changes data at a Database. Now, when I kick an action from the AngularJSSite create a new user for example, the RESTService creates a job in a joblist, and the job will be performed from any other service not relevant, and after some seconds, the service will give a sign to the RESTService, if the job is done. The job will be set to done in the database.p  pNow, at this point as the job is set to done, i need to send a request from the RESTService to the PHP Websocket, ant the Websocket should send a message to the angularJSSite. I know, i could polling through AngularJS, but that would create too big traffic, beacuse many users will use that system at the same time.p  pSorry for my bad explanation and also for my bad english  im german .p  pMy simple question strongIs there any possibility to send a request from the PHP RESTService to the websocket, so the websocket will notify my angular The job is done.strongp  pIs that simple request possible, or have I to create a PHP Client which refreshes over and over the database to check, if the job is done and send then to the angular through the websocket Any other ideasp  pThanks for your helpp  pstrongEditstrong Maybe as said some code would be good .

The function will first create the table, and then create an arbitrary model by using the newly created table. Finally, the newly created model will be used to save. Notice that the save method is used without any parameters and the newly created table has very few fields. These are all intended and the desired result is just the insertion of a new row into the table provided to the function.p  pWhen I run this code, I get the following messagep  blockquote   pTable randomTableName for model randomModelName was not found in   datasource default.p blockquote  pWhen I check my database, the table is there.

Negative 463 pI am currently building an Angular front end on a site that pulls much of its data from an API that requires authorization via login.p  pI have built the following authInterceptor that works well and redirects users to the login page if a 401 error is sent from the serverp  precodeangular   .modulemyApp.services   .factoryauthInterceptor, [rootScope, q, window, location, functionrootScope, q, window, location       return          request functionconfig            config.headers  config.headers             if window.sessionStorage.token              config.headers.Authorization  Bearer   window.sessionStorage.token                       return config         ,         response functionresponse            return response  q.whenresponse         ,         responseError functionrejection           if rejection.status  401             location.pathlogin                      return q.rejectrejection                    ] codepre  pThe problem with this is that the API calls and therefore, the 401 errors dont occur until the end of the page load process   so, users can see a split second of all of the elements e.g., HTML, CSS, images and all other elements that dont hit the API loading up on my page before the application hits the API and gets the 401.p  pIve worked around this by putting a random API call right at the beginning of my MainController that doesnt really do anything but this seems like the wrong way to do it since Im making an unnecessary ping to the server. Any suggestions and best practices around thisp  pAlso, when I do hit those unauthorized routes, I get the ugly 401 error messages in my console  is there a way to do this redirect without displaying those to the user or is this normalp
Negative 463 pIm trying to make a function in this extension that will open a tab with a given url and run a script on that tab with a given filename.

Negative 463 pI was told on one of environments ASP.NET application consumes even up to 64GB of RAM. I dont know how long it takes to consume it and I have not tried to monitor this app with any kind of tool yet. But I suspect that this is some memory leak. My colleague said that maybe it is not and that its possible that GC decides not to garbage collect because it still has 64GB RAM left.p  pFrom what I understand its not possible to use that much of RAM without some extensive caching built in and I have not seen this in this applications source code. I know GC can decide to grow Generation 0 when it sees that it needs more space but in order to consume 64GB this memory must be used by either Gen2 or LOH right This is Business Intelligence app and it does store some data in Session between postbacks so that it does not hit data warehouse every time but still 64GB of RAM consumed seems suspicious to me.p

Negative 463 pIve been looking at examples of C code that is compiled for some lesser known processors like ZPU using the gcc cross compiler.p  pMost of the working examples I see assume a certain arquitecture Memory map and set of peripherals and simply give you a recipe to compile for these and they work.p  pHowever I can find very little information on what needs to modified if you use the same cpu with a different memory map and set of peripherals. p  pFrom what Ive read. There are two main files that I need to make sure that are done right. The linker script that is used and the crt0.o Which if I need to modify means recompiling the crt0.S which is assembler.

Negative 463 pThis question is kind of a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1830050whysameoriginpolicyforxmlhttprequestWhy same origin policy for XMLHttpRequestap  pHowever, this answer isnt satisfactory because it doesnt address the fact that there are workarounds as stated in the question. The answer only addresses security concerns related directly to the XMLHttpRequest but these problems are still present with JSONP and possibly CORS, not sure. So the question still remains  Why have a strict Same Origin policy when there are workarounds like JSONP thats arguably even worse because its executable rather than static contentp  pHeres an example Company.com wants to make an AJAX call to some unprotected resource, like a simple public API for some data lookup. Company.com realizes that this may be insecure so they will carefully scrub the data to ensure there is no funny business. However, XMLHttpRequest does not allow this, so Company.com must use JSONP, but this would prevent the scrubbing of data and could result in an Attacker injecting arbitrary Javascript onto the page. How is this a better solutionp  pAnother example Company.com has a vulnerability and an attacker is able to inject Javascript onto the page which is then viewable by some user there are a million ways this can happen its probably the most common website attack. With a strict SameOrigin policy, the attacker can mess with the page all day long but he cant call home which is an important detail because it means all your data is safe.

Negative 463 pIm trying to configure a remote OpenFlow controller over an interface which is also part of the bridge OpenVswitch is managing. I am emnotem using mininet rather, I have a real VM host supporting a few qemukvm VMs with a real ethernet port. I want the tap interfaces plus the ethernet port to all be in the same bridge and managed by OVS. The OpenFlow controller resides on a different host, reachable only through the physical ethernet port. So far I have set the remote controller for the bridge as well as put the failure mode into standalone. Unfortunatley the network is simply not coming up after a reboot NB before I lost connectivity I did verify that traffic was flowing between the VM host and the OF controller host on port 6633. It seems that, at a minimum, I need to update the OVS database with an inband setting in some table, but Im not sure how to do this or if this will be sufficient along with the things Ive already done. With mininet, setting this inband configuration appears to be handled by the topo command, but obviously I cant do it this way. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of an OVS configurationp

Negative 463 pIm currently implementing Google authentication on Android with offline access. This entails requesting a onetime authorization code that can be sent to the server and redeemed for a refresh token. So far so good.p  pHowever imagine that there is an error on the server between the time that the code is redeemed and a response is sent to the user indicating that they have been authenticated. If the user then rerequests an authentication code, Google returns the same one as was previously issued. When the server attempts to redeem this code with Google, the errorp  blockquote   pInvalid Grant  This code was already redeemedp blockquote  pis returned.p  pIs there a way of recovering gracefully from such a case that doesnt require the user to try again later when Google will decide to issue a new code I realise that the waiting period to get a new code is only 5 or 10 minutes, but this still isnt a very nice situation from the users point of view.p

Negative 463 pWe are a small dev team that has inherited a decent sized ASP.NET MVC project started a few years ago with ASP.NET 4.  We are looking to migrate to ASP.NET 5 at some point.  Currently the solution has 3 projects  Data, Services, Web.  The data project uses the Entity Framework.  The Web project previously was just MVC but now houses a Web API where we have a couple hundred RESTful API calls and an AngularJS frontend.p  pIt looks like the ASP.NET 5 default solutions for web applications uses a new structure with the web project containing wwwroot and other things.  Would you recommend having multiple projects or should we keep the data and services in the main project  Im leaning towards the single project approach, but Im unsure what the best long term structure would be.

Negative 463 pI have encountered a problem with a custom codevectorcodetype class. I get a runtime error codedynamiclinks3941,0x7fff749a2310 malloc  error for object 0x61636f6c65720054 pointer being freed was not allocated  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug codep  pThe problem seems to be intermittent and stops occurring whenever I make any small change in the application code e.g. adding an codestdcoutcode in an arbitrary place. The problem also appears and disappears randomly if I make changes to the compiler optimisation options e.g. if I change from codeO3code or codeOfastcode. For example, a certain code configuration by configuration I mean introduction of codestdcoutcodes in an arbitrary places may work with one optimisation, but produce an error when I use another optimisation. I could not reproduce the problem with the codeO2code optimisation flag. p  pBoth the classes and the application codes are quite long and rely on a variety of custom types. However, most of the code associated with the classes are getter and setter functions. Here, I only provide the constructors and the member variables of the classes. The functionality of the gettersetter functions should be apparent from the code. p  pUnfortunately, I am also having difficulties debugging the code using gdb.

Negative 463 pFor a project I am working on, I am trying to count the vowels in text file as fast as possible. In order to do so, I am trying a concurrent approach. I was wondering if it is possible to concurrently read a text file as a way to speed up the counting I believe the bottleneck is the IO, and since right now I am reading the file in via a buffered reader and processing line by line, I was wondering if it was possible to read multiple sections of the file at once.p  pMy original thought was to use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11180078splitfilejavalinux1118052711180527Split File  JavaLinuxap  pbut apparently MappedByteBuffers are not great performance wise, and I still need to read line by line from each MappedByteBuffer once I split. p  pAnother option is to split after reading a certain number of lines, but that defeats the purpose.p  pWould appreciate any help.p

Negative 463 pSo I have a file and I want to split it into 2 groups.

My problem with this is that it uses line numbers to make them into groups. If I were to use different files in the future, it might not be seperated by those exact numbers. I do know though that each starts withp  precodeBEGIN PROCESSING ALPHA PNRS codepre  pand ends withp  precodeEND PROCESSING ALPHA PNRS codepre  pBeta is the same as alpha, but BETA is inserted where ALPHA is.p  pMy question is, is there a syntactical way where it is similar to what I have above, but uses regular expressions to solve my problem of making these into 2 groups of Lists And if there is could you please let me know in the form of an answer instead of a comment Thanksp

Negative 463 pI am consuming 3axis accelerometer data using Rx.  I need to set up some unit tests.  The data frames come in fast, with the median timespan between frames being 80ms, but on occasion it comes in at 120ms.  Also, it is never exactly 80ms, but hovers in that range.p  pSo I have created a class that subscribes to the IObservable and records the dataframes sequentially in a .csv file.  One of the fields in the .csv file is the start time of the frame with the first frame having start time  0.0.p  pNow I want to read that file and stream it again for the purpose of testing and development.  I want to use the StartTime field as the schedule for when I will fire any given Accelerometer frame when testing.p  pI looked over the answers in this question, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12692244schedulingaienumerableperiodicallywithnetreactiveextensionsScheduling a IEnumerable periodically with .NET reactive extensionsa but it seems only to address constant timespans.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there already a canonical and preferred way to schedule frame pushes at irregular but known intervals in the Rx framework, or should I just roll my own somehowp  pEdit 2 I am interested in something which could be as simple asp  precodeIObservableltTgt AsObservable    IEnumerableltTgt source, FuncltT, TimeSpangt getTimeDelta     var retVal  ColdObservableVaryingTime    foreachvar frame in source            retVal.AddScheduledgetTimeDelta, frame        return retVal  codepre  pEdit 1 what I call frames in this question, Rx documentation calls TState.p

Negative 463 pI have an ASP.net project that uses AJAX tab containers. I have created and applied custom themes for my tab containers. However, I seem to have run in to an odd issue.

Negative 463 pIm having trouble with codegoogle.maps.places.Autocompletecode and single page app. Long story short I have a Angular directive with codeformcode with codeinputcode field in it. The codeinputcode field has autocomplete functionality so when clicked and address typed it shows matching addresses. Its single page app so whe user navigates to the page it loads appropriate codengviewcode. When user navigates away to another page and another content is loaded in codengviewcode memory is not cleared. Using profile and snapshots in Google Chrome I clearly see there is rubbish left over and the form element is detached its marked in red. This is due to codeinputcode field where codeautocompletecode is attached. I narrowed it down to the line where new codegoogle.maps.places.Autocompletecode is declared. If I remove the call to autocomplete memory clears as it should, otherwise however the entire form where input codeaaacode exists stays in memory. I also clear all the variables on destroy so it could be garbage collected but nothing seems to work. Is there any solution to this and any way to use Autocomplete in dynamically loaded ngviews without leaking memoryp  precodelink function scope, elem, attrs, ctrl                  var autocomplete var aaadocument.getElementByIdaddress                  function initializeGoogleMaps                      autocomplete  new google.maps.places.Autocomplete                         aaa,                              types [geocode]                                              scope.ondestroy, function                           .paccontainer.remove                         autocompletenull                                       initializeGoogleMaps  some other code codepre

Negative 463 pI currently have a Telerik RadGrid whose columns are automatically constructed from data fetched with a stored procedure. I append a GridHyperLinkColumn to this grid, and my goal is to now set the hyperlinks in each cell of this column.

But the additional axis has the same values as one of my columns. But I want the additional axis to have the values of my timesteps array. So that the resulting shape would be something like 22221, 22221, 3 and not 22221, 1, 3 like its now.p

Negative 463 pI am creating a Rails app for a client that lets them connect data generating devices to the app and perform analysis.  The Device either POST some data to app or the APP GETS it from a url. p  pThe device can generate a lot of data 250M recordsrows in a year and  data generation rate might grow. p  pThere is no interdevice analytics. Hence, I am thinking of partitioning the data by limiting 1 device to 1 table. p  precodeHere are few things I need   1. Client should be able to add a new device through a form.   2. This should create a new table, say device1data at runtime and also run appropriate migrations.  codepre  pIn a way its similar to a multitenant architecture. Whats a good way to achieve this in Rails4.1 deployed on Herokup

Firstly, the codecbTestStylecode of codeComboBoxItemcode I want to be able to populate dynamically.  Databinding would be my obvious goto, but with the separator and Reset styles at the end, Im not sure how to do this.  I currently have the codeComboBoxItemcodes hardcoded in XAMLp  precode    ltComboBox xNamecbTestSelect               Height34               Width18                IsEnabledFalsegt         ltComboBoxItem StyleStaticResource cbTestStyle ContentTest 1 Foreground7FFF0000 SelectedComboBoxItemSelectedgt         ltComboBoxItem StyleStaticResource cbTestStyle ContentTest 2 Foreground7F00FF00 SelectedComboBoxItemSelectedgt         ltComboBoxItem StyleStaticResource cbTestStyle ContentTest 3 Foreground7F0000FF SelectedComboBoxItemSelectedgt         ltComboBoxItem StyleStaticResource cbSeparatorStylegt         ltComboBoxItem StyleStaticResource cbResetStyle ContentReset allgt     ltComboBoxgt codepre  pIn this example, I would ideally like to dynamically create the first three items and have the separator and reset items remain static.  Im still relatively new to WPF.  I felt like trying to create this control in WinForms which the application this user control would be used in is would be a lot more complicated.  Plus Im trying to steer us towards using WPF more anyway.p  pAny help or links to other questions or tutorials online would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 463 pIn routeChangeStart Im checking if my user is authenticated and if I have its own data in rootScope, otherwise I make a call to retrieve these data.p  pThe problem is my app fires routeChangeSuccess and my controllers are before my user request is finished.

Negative 463 pIm trying to find a way to map something like a simple SVG circle to a point on a webglearth globe.p  pI understand that the API only supports adding markers with the option of a custom image or polygons, but since theres a mechanism to fix points for markerspolygons, Im guessing it should be possible to map latlong to xy screen coordinates.p  pI havent been able to locate the function used by the markerpolygon mapping, so if thats not possible perhaps others have solved the problem by overlaying another map altogether on the webgl earth globe.p  pReally appreciate any thoughts whatsoever about a possible way to tackle this problem  webglearth is perfect for my project assuming I can find a way to map my own shapes to the projection.  Thanksp

Negative 463 pIm trying to develop an app. In it user can input his friends name and birthday inluding hours and minutes. When its friends birthday, application should send a notification. First Ive tried to use timerTask to send a notification when needed, but it only sent it once, and only if time Ive input is the same means that timetask is working. But when I input at least 1 minute more, 1 minute later theres no notification. Same goes for handler.

Negative 463 pIn Npgsql V2, I could use the following code to update a record, and return the updated record values using a single Npgsql command.p  pThe codecommand.CommandTextcode property contains both an UPDATE statement and also a SELECT statement.
