Negative 494 pIve got a very simple line of code in ObjectiveCp  precodeif selectedEntity  nil ampamp [selectedEntity isKindOfClass[MobileEntity class]] codepre  pOccasionally and for no reason I can tell, the game crashes on this line of code with an EXCBADACCESS. It usually seems to be about the time when something gets removed from the playing field, so Im guessing that what emwasem the selectedEntity gets deallocd, then this results. Aside from being impossible to select exiting Entities but who knows, maybe this isnt actually true in my code..., the fact that I am specifically checking to see if there emisem a selectedEntity before I access it means that I shouldnt be having any problems here. ObjectiveC is supposed to support Boolean shortcitcuiting, but it appears to not be EDIT looks like shortcircuiting has nothing to do with the problem.p  pAlso, I put a trycatch around this code block because I knew it was exploding every once in a while, but that appears to be ignored Im guessing EXCBADACCESS cant be caught.p  pSo basically Im wondering if anybody either knows a way I can catch this and throw it out because I dont care about this error as long as it doesnt make the game crash or can explain why it might be happening. I know ObjectiveC does weird things with the nil value, so Im guessing its pointing to some weird space that is neither an object pointer or nil.p  pEDIT Just to clarify, I know the below code is wrong, its what I was guessing was happening in my program. I was asking if that would cause a problem  which it indeed does. p  pEDIT Looks like there is a fringe case that allows you to select an Entity before it gets erased. So, it appears the progression of the code goes like thisp  precodeselectedEntity  obj NSAutoreleasePool pool  ... [obj release] if selectedEntity  nil ampamp etc...  [pool release] codepre  pSo Im guessing that because the Autorelease pool has not yet been released, the object is not nil but its retain count is at 0 so its not allowed to be accessed anyway... or something along those linesp  pAlso, my game is singlethreaded, so this isnt a threading issue.p  pstrongEDIT I fixed the problem, in two ways. First, I didnt allow selection of the entity in that fringe case. Second, instead of just calling [entities removeObjectAtIndexi] the code to remove any entities that will be deleted, I changed it tostrongp  precodeDeselect it if it has been selected. if entity  selectedEntity      selectedEntity  nil   [entities removeObjectAtIndexi] codepre  pstrongJust make sure you are assigning nil to the variable at the same time you release it, as jib suggested.strongp

Negative 494 pWe are currently leveraging a third party tool to convert pdf files into gifs and displaying them in the browser.

[edit]p  pIf you want to use ActiveRecord in a website or webservice you have to tell it via the configuration it is running in a web envirnoment. p  pHow ever it assumes it will have a HttpContext.Current which doesnt exsist in WCF. p  pSo we tell AR to use our own implementation of AbstractThreadScopeInfo which also implements IWebThreadScopeInfo to tell it it is compatible with the Session per Request pattern which becomes a Session per Session pattern today.p  pAdded some fixes to lazy loading exception I ran into from a hrefhttpwww.developerfusion.comcommunityblogentry8214605castleactiverecordmoreonlazyloadingandsessionscopes relnofollowhereap  precodepublic class WCFThreadScopeInfo  AbstractThreadScopeInfo, IWebThreadScopeInfo       public static readonly ILog Logger  LogManager.GetLogger typeof WCFThreadScopeInfo      private readonly object syncLock      public WCFThreadScopeInfo              syncLock  new object            public new void RegisterScope ISessionScope scope              CurrentStack.Push scope           public new ISessionScope GetRegisteredScope               if CurrentStack.Count  0                      Instead of returning a null stack as is in the original ActiveRecord code,              instantiate a new one which adds itself to the stack immediately             lock syncLock                              if CurrentStack.Count  0                                      new SessionScope                                                 return CurrentStack.Peek  as ISessionScope           public new void UnRegisterScope ISessionScope scope              if GetRegisteredScope   scope                      throw new ScopeMachineryException Tried to unregister a scope that is not the active one                  CurrentStack.Pop            public new bool HasInitializedScope              get  return GetRegisteredScope   null             region Overrides of AbstractThreadScopeInfo     public override Stack CurrentStack              [MethodImplMethodImplOptions.Synchronized]         get                      Lets use the OperationContext instead of the HttpContext             OperationContext current  OperationContext.Current              Which offcourse cant be null             if current  null                 throw new ScopeMachineryException Could not access OperationContext.Current              Get the first WCF StackContainer from the OperationContext or null             WCFStackContainer stackContainer  WCFStackContainercurrent.Extensions.FirstOrDefault ex gt ex is WCFStackContainer              If the previous statement didnt find any add a new one to the OperationContext             if stackContainer  null                              Logger.Debug Creating new WCFStackContainer                 stackContainer  new WCFStackContainer                  current.Extensions.Add stackContainer                           In the end return the stack in the container             return stackContainer.Stack                   endregion  codepre  pAs you can see above we need a WCFStackContainer which can be added to the current OperationContext.Extensions.

Negative 494 pI use embedded servers that run inside Junit test cases. Sometimes these servers require a working directory for example the Apache Directory server.p  pThe new Rule in Junit 4.7 can handle these cases.

However this does not work because Junit processes the rules in reverse order as they are defined in the file. The TemporaryFolder Rule will not be executed before the server Rule. Thus the rootfolder in TempraryFolder will be null, resulting that any files are created relative to the current working directory.p  pIf I reverse the order of the attributes in my class I get a compile error because I cannot reference a variable before it is defined.p  pIm using Junit 4.8.1 because the ordering of rules was fixed a bit from the 4.7 releasep
Negative 494 pI created a branch from my SVN trunk.  In the branch, another developer deleted a directory, but then readded it with the same files.

Negative 494 pIm currently creating a WPF application, using C and XAML in Visual Studios 2010.p  pI have a master grid. In that master grid I have a group bar which you can select different items. Depending on what you select, the middle of the master grid can be totally different. What I was wondering is, whats the best way to program the middle partp  pRight now, I have it set up in such a way that everything in the middle is dynamically programed in C, and everything on the outside is programmed in XAML. p  pIn C I programmed for each group bar item, there is a grid that goes with it so that different content can be displayed on it. Each grid is a child of the master grid. Each grid is visible or hidden when necessary. Is this the best way to approach thisp  pThe best example of this is in Outlook 2007, where you have your group bar on the right hand side. When you select different items on the group bar mail, calendar, tasks the right of the group bar completely changes.p

Negative 494 pI have a rather complicated toolchain so prepare for a lengthy post until getting to the problemp  pI managed to get PDFCreator and a virtual PDF creating printer under Windows 7 running in server mode as a service. Next step in the process is PDFCreator calling a VBScript after the PDF is created. The script uploads the PDF to our server via WebService and polls the server for a resulting PDF. When the resulting PDF has been downloaded, the VBScript needs to print it to a confiured printer.p  pNow for printing I was using the integrated COM object of PDFCreator which gives access to GhostScript. This worked perfectly onder Windows XP for any account the PDFCreator service was started. For example as a domain user to have access to shared printers from the VBScript, as the user context is the same as the PDFCreator service.p  pNow I tried the same for Windows 7 and used the local system account as before, because my test printer is a local one and works, i.e. TestPage. Effect is that the wscript stays in the task manager and never finishes. Next I activated Interactive mode for the service and a saw Ghostscript asking for the printer to print to. The Printer does exist as I checked before calling GS within the VBScript, but out of any reason GhostScript does not see the printer although in the dialog opened to select the printer, the printer is there.p  pAfter days long searching and unsuccessfully trying even a dedicted new administrator account for the servive with no success I finally came up  with a way to get it working. Changing the user for the PDFCreator service to locale service I first got an error that the PDFCreator COM object creation failed. Okay I thought this makes sense, as locale service has less rights that locale system. I got around this limit by changing the access right under comexp.msc and granted locale service rights for local and remote COM and Script access. Voil, everything worked.p  pWhat I do not understand Why is Ghostscript under the locale service account capable to find the printer although the account has less rights that locale system p  pAnd Which access right do I need to set for locale system or any other user account to make it workp  pOr Is there a comprehensive list of detailed differences between these accountsp  pThank you very much and greetz, GHadp

Negative 494 pIm trying to make an educated decision about what ORM to use for a number of legacy applications Im responsible for porting to MVC 2. The ORMs Ive looked at are LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Entities and nHibernate. L2S seemed to be the easiest, but Ive found numerous articles and blog entries stating that Microsoft would no longer be updating it after .NET 3.5. With that in mind, Ive been working with Entities a bit, but have found that it is cumbersome and overcomplicated for the small applications Im working with same with nHibernate. I recently purchased Pro ASP.NET MVC 2 Framework by Steven Sanderson, in which he chose to use LINQ to SQL as his ORM, at one point stating  p  precode Im aware that some developers have expressed concerns that Microsoft might   deprecate LINQ to SQL in favor of Entity Framework. However, Microsoft included   and enhanced LINQ to SQL in .NET 4, so these fears cannot be entirely justified.  codepre  pI was unaware that they had made changes, nor had I bothered to look, as the general community opinion seemed to be that L2S was approaching endoflife, to be replaced by L2E. Damien Guard wrote about some of the changes on his blog httpdamieng.comblog20090601linqtosqlchangesinnet40 for those interested.p  pMy hope is that someone can shed some light on Microsofts position regarding LINQ to SQL. The applications Im porting and updating have a roughly 810 year life span, so Id prefer to adopt a technology that wont be abandoned in that timeframe and leave my replacements up creek. Of course, if anyone has any other recommendations for small shops  our database has less than 5 million records  Id love to hear them.p

Negative 494 pMy embedded projects have a postprocess step that replaces a value in the executable with the CRC of some sections of the flash. This step can only be done after linking since that is the first opportunity to CRC the image. In the past the file format was COFF, and I have created a custom tool to do the patching. p  pThe development tool has switched to ELF, so I need to reimplement the CRC patcher. Before I do, I thought Id look for an existing tool to do this. The compiler is based on gcc, but I cant see any combination of codeldcode and codenmcode and codereadelfcode that can do the job. A Google search has not been fruitful. p  pMy present tool uses codenmcode to find the address to patch, and calls the patcher with the address, the expected value to prevent overwriting the wrong data, and the new CRC value. The CRC is calculated on a hex format of the executable that I also patch so fortunately I dont have to redo that part.p  pI can implement this with codelibelfcode and custom code again, but before I do, does it already existp  pIs there a better way to accomplish my goal of putting a CRC of the executable into the executable so its available to the applicationp

Negative 494 pIm working on a GuiModule for Qt to plot realtime measurements like in an digital oscilloscope, based on a hrefhttpqwt.sourceforge.net relnofollowQwta. Everything works so far like it should, but maybe there are some features left to add p  pIn the moment the data is stored columnwise in QVectors, together with one global timeReference QVector in one seperate QObject. So the data can be discarded rowwise to keep only Meusurement  up to a certain past. All QVectors always have the same length. The complete data can then be rowwise timecorrectly plotted in a QwtPlot.p  pI wanna encapsulate the datastorage more, to be more independent on working with the measurements. Therefore it would be nice to add a seperate List of timecoordinates for every measurement and put them both in a seperate QObject, which accepts and delievers the data. Then there would be 10 or 20 of such QObjects, one for every datachannel, which are seperately plotted by an overlying QObject on the QwtPlot.p  pThe data can now be dynamically whatever  how the data is stored, altered or discarded in between should not be visible to the outside. p  pMy Question is Is this smart 20 or 30 QObjects containing each 10000 measurements, 10000 timevalues, plus a seperate memory region of similar size dynamically filled where a subset ob the data is presented for plotting... Is it sane to receive each measurement in its QObject as a signal, firing at around 1kHz The signalslotpart comes from the idea of making every OBject a QThread later, and implement realtime filtering, like lowpass or FFT on the data  therefore, signalslot connections are handy to controll the output in an multithreaded environmentp  pHow could the data be stored efficiently inside my OBjects Im thinking about two QList, one for time and one for precious data. Then allocating two plain doublearrays on the fly for dynamic access, whose pointers together with the length are put in a struct and returned by an accessDatapastTime method. The dynamic memory is filled with the timeValmeasurement combinations from now up to a certain point in the past, settable by a signal. Everything fragile secured by mutexes inside the QObject.p  pWhen discarding old values, the QList has to be searched from the beginning for the first value which is young enough to be kept, the ones residing before this index are thrown away. Is a QMap smarter because of its upperBound function I figure that the hidden overhead wouldnt be worth it.p  pHow would one pro try to solve this problem nicely, efficiently or without any hassle Special QtFeatures I should know about Or are even free solutions out there Anyhow, much text for such a basic question...

Negative 494 pIm implementing the a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencepluginslikeFacebook Like Buttona, but Im running into some trouble with the width. Im using the JavaScript SDK implementation, not the direct iframe.p  pAccording to the documentation, the default width is code450code. Thats fine, and I understand that the width can be changed by way of the codewidthcode attribute on the codeltfblikegtcode tag. However, my problem is that I really cannot specify a fixed width. Due to the nature of the button, the width is not constant in all states. For example, if no one has liked the page yet it displays Be the first of your friends to like this if someone has, it displays XXX people like this. Be the first of your friends and still if emyouem have liked it, it displays You like this emorem You and XXX people like this. In other words, there are many states of the button, none of which share a constant width.p  pThis wouldnt be much of a problem if it werent for the fact that I want to display the button floated on the righthand side of a codeltdivgtcode. To be clearer, this is what Im doingp  precodeltdiv idwrappergt     ltspan classfblikegtltfblike showfacesfalse width450 fontlucida grandegtltfblikegtltspangt     ... ltdivgt ltstyle typetextcssgt .fblike      display inlineblock     padding 0.5em     position absolute     right 0     top 0  wrapper      position relative  ltstylegt codepre  pThis works fine, but the problem is that the iframe now has a strongconstant widthstrong of 450 pixels. Since the iframe is leftaligned, when the text is shorter there is extra space to the right. Ive tried various applications of codetextalign rightcode to no avail. And the problem is further compounded by the fact that this is really just fancy markup for an iframe that is added by the FB SDK, so Im powerless to change any of its contents with CSS or JavaScript.p  pI need a solution that will either a keep the width of the button area dynamic i.e., it changes according to the content or b rightalign everything in the button area.p  pThanks for any help anyone can give mep

Negative 494 pI understand that viewRenderer is a built in action controller helper, but where exactly is this set  I see that when the action controller is instantiated, it creates the helper broker, which iterates over the ZendControllerActionHelperBrokerPriorityStack, which already has the viewRenderer within it.  But how did the viewRenderer get set within the helper broker priority stack  As always, thx for taking the time out to read my questionp

Negative 494 pIm in a Silverlight 4.0 project where we have a variety of windows and dialogs, some of which are modal.  In the hosting HTML, weve bound the emonbeforeunloadem event so that we can warn users before their browser forces them to lose any changes from the Silverlight app by accidentally hitting F5, for example.p  pHowever, if there happens to be a modal showing in the Silverlight app, the browsers onbeforeunload dialog is hidden from view, and the user cant click anything.  The only recourse it to kill the browser process.  Weve observed this both in IE8 and IE8 so far.p  pHas anyone else encountered this  If so, what workarounds have you usedp

Negative 494 pHey there, I want to evaluate a mathematical function userdefined which returns several values in an array this function is a vector based function fRnRm with n input coordinates and m output functions in C for certain parameters, e.g.p  precodedouble myfuncconst mxArray point      double dat  mxGetPrpoint     double vals  new double[ 3 ]      vals[0]  dat[0]dat[0]dat[0]dat[0]dat[0]     vals[1]  sindat[0]dat[1]dat[2]dat[2]cosdat[1]     vals[2]  expdat[0]sindat[0]dat[3]      double pnt  vals      return pnt  codepre  pCurrently I do this on the CPU. So I call the function once and get back an array with all function values. As I want to parallelize it now on the GPU, I thought about how to do it. p  pI assume it would be kind of stupid to evaluate myfunc completely in each thread since than each thread would calculate the whole functionarray. strongIs this the right assumptionstrongp  pWould there be any way to comfortable calculate only the nth element of the functionarray and return it, so that 5 threads could easily calculate the functionarray in parallel instead of one CPU calculating it completely alonep  pThe only way I could think off wasp  precodedouble myfunc0const mxArray point      double dat  mxGetPrpoint     return dat[0]dat[0]dat[0]dat[0]dat[0]  double myfunc1const mxArray point      double dat  mxGetPrpoint     return sindat[0]dat[1]dat[2]dat[2]cosdat[1]  double myfunc2const mxArray point      double dat  mxGetPrpoint     return expdat[0]sindat[0]dat[3]  codepre  petc... But this would be quite uncomfortable for the user who uses the program later because he always would have to create new C functions if he wants to extend the functionarray instead of just adapting ONE single Cfunction. And a further problem would be I have to dynamically call the function since the number of functions is dynamic and thus I would have to do a call to codemyfuncicode and dont know if this is a good way to do it... So the question is if there would be a better way to deal with this problem p

Negative 494 pIn most browsers, when an html element is only partially opaque, its children inherit this opacity.  It isnt quite inheritancemore correctly, the entire image is assembled, including the parent and its children recursively, and then the opacity is applied to the entire thing.  p  pIn IE8 and I would assume also for earlier versions of IE, this is not always what happens with opacity.  If the child elements have positionstatic the default if no position is specified, then it does work as I described above.  However, it appears to be the case that, if the position is set to anything else e.g., absolute, or relative, then the child element is fully opaque.  p  pI want to know how to make the opacity correctly affect both the parent and the child elements but still keep the child element with positionabsolutep  pHere is an example of the problem.  The following code is supposed to make a translucent gray box with a translucent blue surrounding area, on top of a vertical red bar.  On Firefox, Chrome, etc., This is what is actually seen.  On IE8, the blue box is correctly translucent, but the gray part is opaque.  p  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltstylegt       div.parentElem                backgroundcolor0000ff         position absolute         left75px         top75px         width300px         height225px                 opacity0.5         filteralphaopacity50              div.childElem                backgroundcolor808080         position absolute         left 10px         right 10px         top 10px         bottom 10px              div.redBar                position absolute         left150px         top50px         height350px         width25px         backgroundcolor ff0000                    ltstylegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv classredBargtltdivgt     ltdiv classparentElemgt       ltdiv classchildElemgtltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pObviously, this is just a toy exampleI could have had a single div with a blue border and a gray background to achieve the desired effect.  In the real scenario, I am layering several different divs, each of which has a png background image to dynamically build an image.  p  pMy first attempted workaround was to apply opacity to both the parent and the child, either by setting the filter on the child to alphaopacity50 or simply setting filterinherit.  This does not achieve the desired result because it makes a translucent blue rectangle with a translucent gray rectangle on top of it.  The empty space in the middle ends up being translucent blueish gray whereas it should be translucent gray.  Similarly, it does not work to make the elements siblings.  Any solution needs to compose the two images before applying any transparency to anything.p  pIn my research, I found some suggestions that applying either zoom1 or floatnone to the inner element might resolve the issue, but neither worked for me.p  pMy eventual workaround was to give the child element positionstatic.  Its kind of an ugly solution, but what I would do to apply it to the above example is change the style of the child element to look likep  precode  div.childElem        backgroundcolor808080     positionstatic     marginleft10px      marginright10px     height205px     margintop10px    codepre  pIts kind of an ugly solution because it means that I have to know the height of the object.  Also, in the real case where I am composing several different pngs, and I would like them to be logical siblings, I have to put them all in a nested parentchildgrandchildetc. relationship.  It also prevents me from adding any textual elements except on the very top of the stack the innermost div without messing up the positioning.  It does work, though, and it looks the same in all browsers.p  pIs there any way to avoid such a horrid workaround and have opacity correctly affect the child elements without making the position static  Thanksp

Negative 494 pI would like to allow the user to draw curves in such a way that no line can cross another line or even itself.

Negative 494 pEventhough I write in python I think the abstract concept is more interesting to me and others. So pseudocode please if you like p  pI have a list with items from one of my classes. Lets do it with strings and numbers here, it really doesnt matter. Its nested to any depth. Its not really a list but a container class which is based on a list. p  pstrongExamplestrong em[1, 2, 3, [a, b, c] 4 [d, e, [100, 200, 300]] 5, [a, b, c], 6]emp  pNote that both [a, b, c] are really the same container. If you change one you change the other. The containers and items can be edited, items inserted and most important containers can be used multiple times. To avoid redundancy its not possible to flatten the list I think because you loose the ability to insert items in one container and it automatically appears in all other containers.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong For the frontend just commandline with the python cmd module  I want to navigate through this structure with a cursor which always points to the current item so it can be read or edited. The cursor can go left and right users point of view and should behave like the list is not a nested list but a flat one. p  pFor a human this is super easy to do. You just pretend that in this list above the sublists dont exist and simply go from left to right and back.p  pFor example if you are at the position of 3 in the list above and go right you get a as next item, then b, c, and then 4 etc. Or if you go right from the 300 you get the 5 next.p  pAnd backwards If you go left from 6 the next is c. If you go left from 5 its 300.p  pSo how do I do that in principle I have one approach here but its wrong and the question is already so long that I fear most people will not read it . I can post it later.p  pP.S. Even if its hard to resist The answer to this question is not Why do you want to do this, why do you organize your data this way, why dont you [flatten the list something out of my imagination] first The problem is exactly what Ive described here, nothing else. The data is structured by the nature of the problem this way.p

Negative 494 pIll try and explain this as best as I can...p  pIm just trying to make sense of views, view models and presenters so I created a little program to illustrate some of the ins and outs. My small application basically stores albums. The albums are listed in a combo box and I have fields for artist, genre and year, which are all text boxes. Up until now, no problems... I created a binding source and bound it to the view model which has properties for title, artist, genre and year and it works as expected. I can cycle through the combo box and the various text boxes will change depending on the combo box selection.p  pI then decided I wanted to add a list of songs for each album, so I added a new songs property to the view model and added a data grid view to the view. This is where I became quite confused. If I bind the binding source I used for everything else to the data grid view, it obviously just wants to render the immediate fields of the view model basically repeating what Im displaying in the text boxes, only in a grid format.p  pAssuming I described the problem adequately enough, what can I do to display the album fields in the text boxes and the songs in the data grid view I think Ive come to the conclusion that I simply need a second binding source, but Id like to avoid it if possible. Ive attempted obvious things like directing the DataMember property of the data grid view to Songs the property name of the songs collection in the view model without any luck.p  pCould anyone point me in the right directionp

Negative 494 pAre there any known techniques and resources related to them, like research papers or blog entries which describe how do dynamically strongprogramaticallystrong detect the part of the code that caused a performance regression, and if possible, on the JVM or some other virtual machine environment where techniques such as instrumentation can be applied relatively easyp  pIn particular, when having a large codebase and a bigger number of committers to a project like, for example, an OS, language or some framework, it is sometimes hard to find out the change that caused a performance regression. A paper such as a hrefhttpbuytaert.netstatisticallyrigorousjavaperformanceevaluation relnofollowthis onea goes a long way in describing how to strongdetectstrong performance regressions e.g. in a certain snippet of code, but not how to dynamically strongfindstrong the piece of the code in the project that got changed by some commit and caused the performance regression.p  pI was thinking that this might be done by instrumenting pieces of the program to detect the exact method which causes the regression, or at least narrowing the range of possible causes of the performance regression.p  pDoes anyone know about anything written about this, or any project using such performance regression detection techniquesp  pEDITp  pI was referring to something along a hrefhttpwww.phoronix.comscan.phppagearticleampitemlinuxperfregressionsampnum2 relnofollowthese linesa, but doing further analysis into the codebase itself.p
Negative 494 pI have a web service that I would like to load test by sending multiple requests to it in parallel. It occurred to me that WF might prove a useful tool to orchestrate that with the flexibility to quickly modify the loadflow and capture timing information in a visible and repeatable way thats why WF is good, right. From my reading to date, it appears that despite being called Parallel and ParallelFor, neither activity will run the enclosed activities in parallel but will run them serially on a single thread and wait for all enclosed activities to complete. If a parallel activity blocks it can then be persisted and execution will continue with the next parallel activity.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq7418327132599This SO questionanswera suggests that if an AsyncCodeActivity is used i.e. where I might call out to a web service, then p  blockquote   pan AsyncCodeActivity always creates a no persist block for the duration of the activitys execution. This prevents the workflow runtime from persisting the workflow instance in the middle of the asynchronous work, and also prevents the workflow instance from unloading while the asynchronous code is executing.p blockquote  pWhich is clearly not what I want either. So how can I use WF to make multiple parallel requests to a webservice or is this a SPRH square peg round holep

Negative 494 pIf I have an iPhone app, Android app, and Blackberry app, is there any way to implement a monthly or yearly subscriptionbased billing scheme such that a user need only pay for one subscription in order to use my app on any device The problem is that each app store seems to have the stipulation that any fees required to use the app must be paid through them so they can take their cut.p  pDropbox does this, but I think they can get away with it because their apps will work for free, and the subcription only offers more storage space. Is their any way to do this type of billing for an app which requires a subscription in order to be used at all If not, will simply adding some sort of free functionality get me around thisp  pThanks.p  p[EDIT]p  pLet me be clear, my question is about how this can be done emlegallyem. Im basically running up into the same issue that caused the Financial Times to stop offering its paper through a native iPhone app. The difference between them and me, though, is that I dont mind paying the app markets their cut. I just want to know if this is possible a user can either order their subscription through Android Market or the App Store, and if a user isnt paying through both stores then I think Im violating the terms of one of the stores.p

My form that fails was originally created with the CE version of Form Builder and imported into the PE version via cutting and pasting the form source.p  pbDetails of problembbr I had configured Orbeon to store my form data as both XML and PDF in Alfresco, however nothing was being stored in Alfresco when the send button was pressed  the form contents were only being updated in the Orbeon Forms eXist database.p  pI then created a simple test form with a single field, and it was successfully sent to Alfresco and both the XML and PDF versions were stored in the configured directory.p  pExamining the orbeon.log file after sending the both the simple test form and the more complex form which fails shows that the failing form throws a warning in the Orbeon log file which does not occur with the form that succeedsp  precodeWARN  XFormsServer   instance  instance not found instance id frpersistenceinstance codepre  pI suspect that this is what is causing the failure, but I dont know how to correct it.p  pBoth the orbeon log file and a Wireshark analysis indicate that processing for the failing form stops after the first two steps and never reaches the PDF generation stage.p  pHere is the traffic generated when trying to send the failing formp  precodeNo. Stream Time      Protocol Info   8 1      0.013116  HTTPXML PUT orbeonfrserviceexistcrudtestalfresco2data8758825eb4cb1047b6c70cb9a8021d63data.xml HTTP1.1   17 3      0.505195  HTTPXML PUT orbeonexistrestdborbeonfrtestalfresco2data8758825eb4cb1047b6c70cb9a8021d63data.xml HTTP1.1   19 3      2.703298  HTTP     HTTP1.1 201 Created   23 1      2.728196  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  codepre  pAnd here is the traffic generated when the simple test form was sentp  precodeNo. Stream Time      Protocol Info   8 1      0.008351  HTTPXML PUT orbeonfrserviceexistcrudtestalfrescodata4b9597478172d9e3a99db4f333136101data.xml HTTP1.1   17 3      0.493899  HTTPXML PUT orbeonexistrestdborbeonfrtestalfrescodata4b9597478172d9e3a99db4f333136101data.xml HTTP1.1   19 3      1.061385  HTTP     HTTP1.1 201 Created   23 1      1.067774  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK   27 1      1.266107  HTTPXML POST orbeonfrservicetestalfrescopdf4b9597478172d9e3a99db4f333136101frlanguageen HTTP1.1   29 3      1.678506  HTTP     GET orbeonfrserviceexistcrudtestalfrescoformform.xhtmldocument4b9597478172d9e3a99db4f333136101 HTTP1.1   34 4      1.724603  HTTP     GET orbeonexistrestdborbeonfrtestalfrescoformform.xhtml HTTP1.1   63 4      1.887303  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK   66 3      1.887533  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK   69 3      3.401139  HTTP     GET orbeonfrserviceexistcrudtestalfrescodata4b9597478172d9e3a99db4f333136101data.xml HTTP1.1   71 4      3.466335  HTTP     GET orbeonexistrestdborbeonfrtestalfrescodata4b9597478172d9e3a99db4f333136101data.xml HTTP1.1   74 4      3.467743  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK   78 3      3.469550  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK   83 5      7.379995  HTTP     GET orbeonxformsserver3.9.0.201105152053orbeonf8ea744bfde8e279e895681476e87b4ae5eec96a.css HTTP1.1   94 5      7.601110  HTTP     HTTP1.1 200 OK  textcss  96 5      7.636405  HTTP     GET orbeonxformsserver3.9.0.201105152053orbeonc2aa09348528b375f1cb95d729030dfb1a6373a0.css HTTP1.1  107 5      7.698251  HTTP     HTTP1.1 200 OK  textcss 109 1      8.540060  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  111 1      8.565153  HTTP     GET orbeonxformsserverdynamic90101f83d4c2f6ea307ee44255f29a21 HTTP1.1  114 1      8.598588  HTTP     HTTP1.1 200 OK  applicationpdf 118 1      8.648522  HTTPXML POST alfrescoapiAuthenticationService HTTP1.1  121 1      8.818012  HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  125 1      8.848028  HTTPXML POST alfrescoapiRepositoryService HTTP1.1  128 1      11.108350 HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  132 1      11.123460 HTTPXML POST alfrescoapiContentService HTTP1.1  135 1      11.238135 HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  139 1      11.272450 HTTPXML POST alfrescoapiAuthenticationService HTTP1.1  142 1      11.287273 HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  145 1      11.300528 HTTPXML POST alfrescoapiRepositoryService HTTP1.1  148 1      11.524832 HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  151 1      11.533724 HTTPXML POST alfrescoapiContentService HTTP1.1  154 1      11.610843 HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  156 1      12.522981 HTTP     GET orbeonfrserviceexistcrudtestalfrescoformform.xhtmldocumentMyConfirmationPage HTTP1.1  157 3      12.556468 HTTP     GET orbeonexistrestdborbeonfrtestalfrescoformform.xhtml HTTP1.1  183 3      12.688109 HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  186 1      12.688383 HTTPXML HTTP1.1 200 OK  194 7      13.630066 HTTP     GET webassetsFormSiteLogo.png HTTP1.1  198 7      13.631951 HTTP     HTTP1.1 200 OK  PNG codepre  pNoting that it was prior to the PDF generation that the process had failed, I turned off sending the PDF version to Alfresco and then the XML version of the original form was successfully saved to Alfresco.

Negative 494 pI seem to be missing something and extensive use of google didnt help to improve my understanding...br Here is my problembr I like to create my domain model in a persistence ignorant manner, for examplep  ol liI dont want to add codevirtualcode if I dont need it otherwise.li liI dont like to add a default constructor, because I like my objects to always be fully constructed. Furthermore, the need for a default constructor is problematic in the context of dependency injection.li liI dont want to use overly complicated mappings, because my domain model uses interfaces or other constructs not readily supported by the ORM.li ol  pOne solution to this would be to have separate domain objects and data entities. Retrieval of the constructed domain objects could easily be solved using the repository pattern and building the domain object from the data entity returned by the ORM. Using AutoMapper, this would be trivial and not too much code overhead.   p  pBut I have one big problem with this approach It seems that I cant really support lazy loading without writing code for it myself. Additionally, I would have quite a lot of classes for the same thing, especially in the extended context of WCF and UIp  ol liData entity mapped to the ORMli liDomain modelli liWCF DTOli liView modelli ol  pSo, my question is What am I missing How is this problem generally solvedp  pUPDATEbr The answers so far suggest what I already feared It looks like I have two optionsp  ol liMake compromises on the domain model to match the prerequisites of the ORM and thus have a domain model the ORM leaks intoli liCreate a lot of additional codeli ol  pUPDATEbr In addition to the accepted answer, please see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14376163572644my answera for concrete information on how I solved those problems for me.p

Negative 494 pIm using OSX Lion and Chrome which allows you to swipe back and forth to go back forward in the browser. However Im finding it often interferes with scrolling within a page. I have horizontal scroll bars within the website im creating and swiping back and forth within them often causes the browser to move forward backward in my browse history  definitely not the behaviour i want. p  pIm creating my horizontal scroll boxes very simply with htmlcss and the overflow property. Im wondering if the correct approach is to use javascript to detect a scroll event, and prevent the default behaviour. It just seems like a more complicated approach to something that should be simple. p

Negative 494 pIm a Java EE beginner and now working on a web app, using JSF,EJB and JPA as the three tiers. The website consists of several apps like twitter and ebay. Their accounts are all binded to the main account. A client can have access to any app after logged in through the index page.p  pThe whole websites structure is likep  precodeMain Pages index.xhtmlLogin register.xhtml Twitter app Twitterindex.xhtml TwitterFriends.xhtml TwitterPosts.xhtml ...  Managed Beans UserBean TwitterBean  EJBs UserEJB TwitterEJB  Entities MuserMain user,has one to one relationship with Twuser TwuserTwitter user,has many to many relationship with itself codepre  pHere are the problems Both JSF managed beans and SFSBs can hold the conversational state, but EJBs are in charge of business logic. So an entity recording the users infoname,password,etc. should be stored in SFSBs. Ive tried annotating UserEJB and TwitterEJB Stateful and inject the UserEJB into TwitterEJB to get the current users account, but the EJBs injected to TwitterEJB and UserBean are different because theyre in different projects.So I put the entity in the managed bean and changed the EJBs to statelesspass the user as argument, which seemed even better due to SLSBs better performance. But it contravenes the role of presentation tier.p  pThe problem can be easily solved if theres only a managed bean and an EJB. I hope that a bean can just deal with the specific apps logic, retrieving the users entity from a correct instance of bean automatically.p  pCould you give me a good design Thanks Sorry for my poor English..p
Negative 494 pI have spent the last 2 days trying to figure out how to use the SvnInfo task in the MSBuild Community Tasks pack relatively. It works on my machine because I used the installer. Though surely I should be able to make it work with a relative path. If I dont install the the pack on the CI server I should be able to store the pack in svn and when the ci server gets all the code to build it, the build script that I have written seems to try to reference the tasks and dlls etc off the c drive where it would normally be installed but doesnt exist. Im not sure why. Even if I use a property to refer to the relative task and then reference the property throughout the task it still seems to error out. p  pI want to retrieve the svn revision number from subversion our svn and then update the assembly revision number. So that we can tie what was implemented back to what changeset was pulled for that release. What little documentation I could find for the msbuild community pack said that I should use the client only but the only one that I could find to use was slik svn. It seems to work locally but somehow that also feels wrong ... should I stick with the same flavor of svn. p  pIF anyone has any suggestions or improvements or links that they were able to find that I could not ... it would be much appreciated.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltProject xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comdevelopermsbuild2003      ToolsVersion4.0gt    ltPropertyGroupgt     ltRevisionNumber Condition RevisionNumber   gtxltRevisionNumbergt     ltConfiguration Condition Configuration   gtDebugltConfigurationgt   ltPropertyGroupgt     lt 1 gt   ltImport Project.ThirdPartyToolsMSBuildCommunityTasksMSBuild.Community.Tasks.Targets gt   ltUsingTask AssemblyFile.ThirdPartyToolsMyMSBuildExtensionsBuildTasks.MSBuildTaks.dll           TaskNameBuildTasks.MSBuildTasks.AssemblyInfoReader gt   ltUsingTask AssemblyFileMSBuildCommunityTasksPathMSBuild.Community.Tasks.dll           TaskNameMSBuild.Community.Tasks.Subversion.SvnInfo gt     ltItemGroupgt     lt Required here in order to use the outDir syntax in the compile target  useage BuildArtifacts gt     ltBuildArtifacts Include.buildartifacts gt     ltSolutionFile Include.OnlineSales.sln gt   ltItemGroupgt    ltItemGroupgt     ltNUnit Include.ThirdPartyToolsNUnitnunitconsole.exe gt     ltTestAssembly Include.buildArtifactsOnlineSales.Tests.dll gt     ltTestResults Include.buildartifactsTestResults.xml gt   ltItemGroupgt     ltTarget NameClean gt     ltRemoveDir DirectoriesBuildArtifacts gt     ltMessage TextCLEAN COMPLETED.

Examples of files you should put in the Caches directory include database cache files and downloadable content, such as that used by magazine, newspaper, and map applications.pli lipData that is used only temporarily should be stored in the tmp directory. Although these files are not backed up to iCloud, remember to delete those files when you are done with them so that they do not continue to consume space on the users device.pli lipUse the do not back up attribute for specifying files that should remain on device, even in low storage situations. Use this attribute with data that can be recreated but needs to persist even in low storage situations for proper functioning of your app or because customers expect it to be available during offline use. This attribute works on marked files regardless of what directory they are in, including the Documents directory. These files will not be purged and will not be included in the users iCloud or iTunes backup. Because these files do use ondevice storage space, your app is responsible for monitoring and purging these files periodically.pli ol  pSo Since application bundle is not backup on icloud.

The documentation said codereadcode returns codeanycode, so is it turning the line to a string I have problems turning the string code1code to the number code1code, or code500.8232code into code500.8232code.  I am also wondering if Racket can directly read numbers in from a file.p

Negative 494 pI am currently developing a system that uses allot of async processing. The transfer of information is done using Queues.

I have mentioned JMS but I am open to anything, in fact I am using Hazelcast for the Queues. p  pPlease note this is more of a architectural question, in terms of available java technologies and methods, and I do feel this is a proper question.p  pAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 494 pI have been working with converting strings to PDFs. A typical problem that arises is the occasional smart quote or other utf8 character which becomes one or another ISO character such as , ,  , , etc. The function defined below solves said problem by encoding them to html entities, however, of course a PDF is not html. When inputting a string with codecode in place for an apostrophe codecode, the function converts it to codeamp8217code. Thats great if we were dealing with HTML, but as a PDF, it treats it as a string and therefore its exact form is never converted.

Negative 494 pWe have a windows service that was developped a while ago which use a lot of scheduled tasks on a distant server. This might seem like a bad idea and it probably is, but since we are working with another company that will only work like that to activate their system, we dont really have more choice than to go with it. p  pIn order for this to happen, we we told to use SCHTASKS command, which can easily start a service on another distant server. We then store the output of this call to a log. Normally, we get this p  precode20120206 094055  SUCCESS Attempted to run the scheduled task WPALREI. codepre  pThis is the normal message we get when everything is good. Sometime we get this p  precode20120220 155329  INFO scheduled task WPALMO2 is currently running. SUCCESS Attempted to run the scheduled task WPALMO2. codepre  pThis is still nothing serious since we know the task can take up some time and we know it will get back to available soon. Sometime we get this p  precode20120213 085003  INFO Scheduled task WPALMO2 has already been disabled. codepre  pThis is not good but we know this means someone disabled the tasks on the other server so we can act accordingly. p  pThis is where it gets weird. We notices that after a while about 2 weekes of continued running, the tasks would not respond. Everytime we checked it seemed everything was running fine the service was running and we could see the content of our database being worked on, but the tasks would still not be started. When we looked at the log file, we found this p  precode20120222 155015  ERROR Class does not exist. codepre  pAnd after a while, we got this message p  precode20120222 152115  ERROR Not enough storage is available to process this command. codepre  pThen the other message appears after and so on. After a while, we simply get thisp  precode20120222 163238   codepre  pMeaning either the Process.Start no longer get the ouptut, either the SCHTASKS no long send it or the process stop being called for some reason. I looked on Google but cant really find anything about SCHTASKS giving out this so I suspect process.start might be the problemp  pdid anybody ever got this and how to correct this  Or is it the process start and is there any other way to correctly start a task from a distant server, providing you have the credentials... p  pAny other thins we might want to check on the server to diagnose the problem  Thanks,p
Negative 494 pFor the past two days Ive been struggling with texture issues in opengl where the textures just come up as white boxes on certain devices and on everything else they show up fine. Ive double checked and used only POT power of two images and that did not resolve the problem. From what I read Im thinking that android is doing something to the bitmaps on these certain devices that is knocking them out of dimension and then causing the textures to come up blank or white.p  pThese images that I am using are not stored within the apk although I have tried to use images stored in the local resources and it doesnt seem to make a difference whether their stored locally or Im using images streamed to the device in the form of a stream. My only other guess is that I need to do something to keep certain builds of android from resizing the images but I dont know how to do this.p

Negative 494 h1 Introduction h1  pI have some sort of values that I might want to access several times each page is loaded. I can take two different approaches for accessing them but Im not sure which one is better. Three already implemented examples are several options for the Language, URI and displaying text that I describe herep  h1 Language h1  pRight now it is configured in this way codelangcode is a function that returns different values depending on the argument.p  pExample codelangfullcode prints the current language, English, while codelangcode prints the abbreviation of the current language, en. There are many more options, like codelangselectcode, codelangselectactcode, etc that print different things. The code is too long and irrelevant for the case so if anyone wants it just ask for it.p  h1 Url h1  pThe Url array also returns different values depending on the request. The whole array is fully defined in the beginning of the page and used to get shorter but accurate links of the current page.p  pExample codeecho Url[full]code would print httpmypage.orgpathtofile.phppage1 and codeecho Url[file]code would print file.php. Its useful for codeactioncode within the forms and many other things. There are more values for codeUrl[folder]code, codeUrl[file]code, etc. Same thing about the code, if wanted, just request it.p  h1 Text h1  p[You can skip this section]p  pTheres another array called Text that is defined in the same way than Url. The whole array is defined at the beginning, making a mysql call and defining all codeText[i]code for current page with a while loop. Im not sure if this is more efficient than multiple calls for a single mysql cell.p  pExample codeecho Text[54]code prints This is just a test array which this could perfectly be implemented with a function like codetext54code.p  h1 Question h1  pWith the 3 examples you can see that I use different methods to do almost the same function no pun intended, but Im not sure which one should become the standard one for my code. I could create a function called codeurlcode and other called codetextcode to output what I want. I think that working with functions in those cases is better, but Im not sure why. So Id really appreciate your opinions and advice.p  pstrongShould I mix arrays and functions in the way I described or should I just use funcionsstrongp  pPlease, base your answer in thisp  ul liThe source needs to be strongreadablestrong and strongreusablestrong by other developersli listrongResource consumptionstrong processing, time and memory.li liThe strongshorterstrong the code the better.li liThe more you strongexplainstrong the reasons the better.li ul  pThank youp  pPS, now I know the differences between Url and Uri.p

If scroll down and click on the middle of the window, popup is displayed at out of the window current display area.........................p  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLICgt lthtmlgt  ltheadgt   ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.7.1.jsgtltscriptgt   ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.8.16jqueryui.jsgtltscriptgt  ltstylegt    div      border1px solid      backgroundff9999      width500px      height500px      displaynone      positionabsolute      ltstylegt   ltscriptgt    var mouseX,mouseY,windowWidth,windowHeight    var  popupLeft,popupTop  document.readyfunction     document.mousemovefunctione            mouseX  e.pageX            mouseY  e.pageY            To Get the relative position            if this.offsetLeft undefined              mouseX  e.pageX  this.offsetLeft            if this.offsetTop  undefined              mouseY  e.pageY  this.offsetTop             ifmouseX lt 0                 mouseX 0            ifmouseY lt 0                mouseY  0             windowWidth   window.width            windowHeight  window.height           html.clickfunction        div.show       var popupWidth   div.outerWidth       var popupHeight   div.outerHeight        ifmouseXpopupWidth gt windowWidth         popupLeft  mouseXpopupWidth       else        popupLeft  mouseX        ifmouseYpopupHeight gt windowHeight         popupTop  mouseYpopupHeight       else         popupTop  mouseY        ifpopupLeft lt 0           popupLeft  0       ifpopupTop lt 0           popupTop  0        div.offsettoppopupTop,leftpopupLeft           ltscriptgt  ltheadgt   ltbodygt         ltbrgtltbrgtltbrgt  ltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgt ltbrgtltbrgt ltbrgt   ltbrgt   ltbrgt   ltbrgt   ltbrgt   ltbrgt          ltbrgtltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt    ltbrgtltbrgtltbrgt ltbrgtltbrgt  ltbrgt   ltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgt         ltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgt              ltdivgt          s dflasld fsadf          sdfas dfsadf         ltdivgt  ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  pCan you please check it.......p

Negative 494 pI have MinGW and I wish to compile the a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgdownload.htmlSQLite amalgamation sourcea into a 64bit dll.

Negative 494 h3Backgroundh3  pI am attempting to create a reusable chart object with a hrefhttpd3js.org relnofollowD3.jsa.  I have setup a codechartcode function that will produce a column chart.

They make a call to the database for every row and column for each of the subreports in Books, Stories and Articles.br 2 When used within CRM 2011, you can only have one parent report per subreport which precludes being able to reuse subreports.  I have a Landscape and Portrait version of the same report landscape has additional columns and I would like to reuse the same subreports but this seems to be unsupported.p  pMy question is whether I could craft a large dataset which contains all the joined properties and then nest a table within a parent table and use filters to only display the correct data within each cell.  To put it another way, the parent Table would have the Authors Name and Email, then there would be 3 sub tables, one in Books, stories and Articles.p  pI have tried putting in a filter into the subtables but I get an error sayingbr The definition of the report ReportName is invalidbr The tablix tablix3 has a detail member with inner members.  Detail members can only contain static inner members...p  pThis makes no sense to me because the email Field is an inner member and it is not static.  Anyone out there know how I should better approach this  Just to preempt the response Change the design of the report, I cant.  This is how the users want to see the data.  I will accept answers which keep this layout but change the underlying implementation, but not answers along the lines of make 3 separate reports.p  pThanks in advance for your attention.p

Id rather have a small fast repository and then add the binaries folder as a submodule if the developer requires it.p  pIve found two potential options so far.

Second, I could use codesvndumpfiltercode to split the current Subversion repository into two and then codegit svn clonecode each separately.p  pMy question is though, what will happen to all the history, and particularly the branches and tags Id still like to know what the folder of binaries looked like at every tag in the project, even though the binaries may not have changed between two tags. is that possiblep  pstrongEditstrong The folder of binaries is not full of build artefacts .class, .o, .dll etc so I cant just strip it out and make them external.

Negative 494 pWe are working on an Enterpriselevel application, which will store tens of thousands of objects with Core Data, and we are having issues on several fronts.p  hr  pOur application has several independent systems which operate on the data when needed. These systems include discovery of items, loading of items, synchronization and UI display. If we design our software correctly, there should be little to none merge conflicts due to the different systems modifying same objects. Each system has its own operation queues, all performing in the background. We wish to keep all object creation and modification in the background to minimize UI performance issues, especially during initial ramp up, where thousands of objects might be created from data on the server. Here we have hit several problems with our various design attempts. Huge memory consumption during these ramp ups, and incorrect orchestration of all the contexts and child contexts, causing deadlocks and crashes. We have attempted the following designsp  ul liOne root codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode managed object context which has one child codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode context. The UI fetched results controllers use this child context to fetch results from. From the codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode child context, we created one codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode child context, which we called savingContext and each background operation created a child context of that savingContext, did its changes, and finally did what we called a deep save, recursively saving to the top. We initially chose this design to not have to deal with codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode notifications from many different child contexts. We wrapped every call to the codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode contexts and access to objects with codeperformBlockAndWaitcode. Functionally, this design performed. All changes and inserts were saved to the persistent store, and UI was updated with the changes. This, introduced two issues. One was laggy UI during ramp up because of merged changes going through the codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode child context, and more importantly, very high memory usage during ramp up. We would hit prohibitive RAM usages due to inability to call coderesetcode recursively on contexts as the main UI child context is there too andor lack of knowledge when to call coderefreshObjectmergeChangescode. So we went a different road.li liHave two toplevel contexts linked with the persistent store coordinator, one codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode for save child contexts, and a codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode for UI display. The codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode listens to codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode notifications from the main codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode context and merges them in the main thread. Each background operation creates a child context of the main codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode context, also with private queue concurrency type, does what it does, performs a deep save recursively, which performs a save on the current context, a recursive call of deep save to its parent, calls reset on the current context and saves again. This way we avoid the memory issues, as created objects are released quickly after save. However, with this design, we have hit a plethora of issues such as dead locks, codeNSInternalInconsistencyExceptioncode exceptions and fetched results controllers not updating the UI despite there being save notifications for the codeNSMainQueueConcurrencyTypecode context. This also cause initial load times in the UI to slow a lot. In the previous design, the fetched results controller returned results very fast, while this has the UI blocked for several seconds until the view loads we initialize the fetched results controller in codeviewDidLoadcode.li ul  pWe have tried many intermediate designs, but they all revolve around the same issues, either very high memory usage, fetched results controller not updating the UI or deadlocks and codeNSInternalInconsistencyExceptioncode exceptions.p  hr  pI am really getting frustrated. I cant but feel as if our designs are overtly complicated for something that should be rather simple, and it is just our lack of understanding some fundamental that is killing us.p  hr  pSo what would you guys suggest What arrangement would you recommend for our contexts How should we manage different contexts in different threads Best practices for freeing up inserted objects and resetting contexts Avoiding dead locks All help would be appreciated at this point.p  hr  pI have also seen recommendations for the MagicalRecords category. Is it recommended We have are already invested in using Core Data types, how difficult would it be to migrate using MRp
Negative 494 pWe have an issue with Microsofts client for NFS sometimes using a large amount of CPU 50100 when accessing a NFS share on a linux box.  p  pThe server seems to get in a state where accessing the NFS starts to use an increasing amount of CPU to do the same operation, causing the system to slow down. Once it gets into this state it does not seem to ever recover. A reboot of the system does fix it temporarily.  Any guidance would be appreciated about methods to diagnose, possible causes, and even better possible solutions.p  pstrongSetupstrongp  pWe have several win 2008 R2 cloud servers accessing an NFS share redhat cluster which access a NFS. They all use client for NFS to access it, using the registry fix described here a hrefhttpblog.cuongnv.com200911windows7clientfornfsandusername.html relnofollowhttpblog.cuongnv.com200911windows7clientfornfsandusername.htmla, we do not have either user name mapping or active directory. They access it via an IP rather than a mounted drive, which in my understanding still uses Microsoft client for NFS to access the NFS share on the linux box. Each server has the drive mounted so we can see what files are on the NFS.p  pFor reference purposes we also have two linux cloud servers accessing the NFS, but have not noticed an issue with them.p  pstrongUsagestrong All files about 815KB The NFS is getting a file listing of several directories containing a total of about 8500 files every minute and then individually checking the date of the file. About 26 times a minute a subset of this directory with about 640 files is listed and each file checked for date. Also there are about 60 file writes and 60 file deletes every minute.p  pAs a side note we are also experiencing A probably unrelated issue where the servers have a stop error when accessing the NFS.

Negative 494 pI am building a Twitter app and Ill be pulling a big amount of data from the users timeline. For speed, I need to query the timeline in parallel. My aim is to pull 1000 of users tweets from the API, but the upper limit of number of tweets per request is set to 200 by the Twitter API. Pagination works by specifying the last oldest tweets ID from the previous request, so I need to know the result of the previous API call to make the next call. This method is not parallelizable.

Negative 494 pI have got a bit of an issue and was wondering if there is a way to have my cake and eat it.p  pCurrently I have a Repository and Query style pattern for how I am using Linq2Sql, however I have got one issue and I cannot see a nice way to solve it. Here is an example of the problemp  precodevar someDataMapper  new SomeDataMapper var someDataQuery  new GetSomeDataQuery var results  SomeRepository.HybridQuerysomeDataQuery                             .Wherex gt x.SomeColumn  1  x.SomeColumn  2                             .OrderByDescendingx gt x.SomeOtherColumn                             .Selectx gt someDataMapper.Mapx  return results.Wherex gt x.SomeMappedColumn  SomeType codepre  pThe main bits to pay attention to here are Mapper, Query, Repository and then the final where clause. I am doing this as part of a larger refactor, and we found that there were ALOT of similar queries which were getting slightly different result sets back but then mapping them the same way to a domain specific model. So take for example getting back a codetblcarcode and then mapping it to a codeCarcode object. So a mapper basically takes one type and spits out another, so exactly the same as what would normally happen in the selectp  precode Non mapped version selectx gt new Car       Id  x.Id,     Name  x.Name,     Owner  x.FirstName  x.Surname    Mapped version selectx gt carMapper.Mapx codepre  pSo the car mapper is more reusable on all areas which do similar queries returning same end results but doing different bits along the way. However I keep getting the error saying that Map is not able to be converted to SQL, which is fine as I dont want it to be, however I understand that as it is in an expression tree it would try to convert it.p  precodeMethod SomeData MapSomeTable has no supported translation to SQL. codepre  pFinally the object that is returned and mapped is passed further up the stack for other objects to use, which make use of Linq to SQLs composition abilities to add additional criteria to the query then finally ToList or itterate on the data returned, however they filter based on the mapped model, not the original table model, which I believe is perfectly fine as answered in a previous questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13623344linq2sqlpointofretrievingdataLinq2Sql point of retrieving dataap  pSo to sum it up, can I use my mapping pattern as shown without it trying to convert that single part to SQLp

Negative 494 pIn my Android app I need to know when the MapView zooming process has been finished. There is no built in solution for that, so I had the idea to override dispatchDraw. p  pdispatchDraw is being invoked as long as the Map is zooming as well as as one scrolls on the Map, but this doesnt matter and my idea is to continuously check if dispatchDraw is invoked by overwriting a variable called dispatchDrawInvoked. When the zoom on the MapView is being invoked the first time that means when the zooming process begins, I start a new thread which continuously set dispatchDrawInvoked every second to false. The idea is that the dispatchDraw method overwrites dispatchDrawInvoked with true a lot of times within this second and when the second is over and dispatchDraw is still true, it means that zooming isnt finished yet. In most cases the zooming is finished and the dispatchDraw stays false, after the loop runs a second time, so it takes at minimum 2 seconds. When the loop recognizes that the zoom process is finished, I set the zooming variable to true to signal to upper classes who need to know that that zooming is finished.p  pSo far so good. The problem is, this whole implementation doesnt behave concurrent. It behaves sequential and the MapView gets stuck for 2 seconds.

Negative 494 pI am adding clientside subtotal calculations to my order page, so that the volume discount will show as the user makes selections.p  pI am finding that some of the calculations are off by one cent here or there. This wouldnt be a very big deal except for the fact that the total doesnt match the final total calculated serverside in PHP.p  pI know that the rounding errors are an expected result when dealing with floating point numbers. For example, 149.95  0.15  22.492499999999996 and 149.95  0.30  44.98499999999999. The former rounds as desired, the latter does not.p  pIve searched on this topic and found a variety of discussions, but nothing that satisfactorily addresses the problem.p  pMy current calculation is as followsp  precodediscount  Math.roundprice  factor  100  100 codepre  pA common suggestion is to work in cents rather than fractions of dollars. However, this would require me to convert my starting numbers, round them, multiply them, round the result, and then convert it back.p  pEssentiallyp  precodediscount  Math.roundMath.roundprice  100  Math.roundfactor  100  100  100 codepre  pI was thinking of adding 0.0001 to the number before rounding. For examplep  precodediscount  Math.roundprice  factor  100  0.0001  100 codepre  pThis works for the scenarios Ive tried, but I am wondering about my logic. Will adding 0.0001 always be enough, and never too much, to force the desired rounding resultp  pNote For my purposes here, I am only concerned with a single calculation per price so not compounding the errors and will never be displaying more than two decimal places.p  pstrongEDITstrong For example, I want to round the result of 149.95  0.30 to two decimal places and get 44.99. However, I get 44.98 because the actual result is 44.98499999999999 not 44.985. The error is not being introduced by the code 100code.

The actionid would point to an object with a perform method that would just house the code that needs to run when the trigger is fired.p  pSo in the end the trigger would evaluate to something like p  precodeaction.perform if actor.sendattribute comparator value codepre  pAnother option, possibly a more standard one, seems to develope a DSL IE FQL for facebook. Would this be a better and more flexible approach.p  pIs this something that a library can handle or if not is this a decent structure for a system like the one I am proposing p  pEDIT Looks like a DSL might be the most flexible way to go. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4936146tutorialsforwritingdslinrubyTutorials for writing DSL in Rubyap

Negative 494 pFirst of all, I know this has been asked a few times now, and I have done lots of research on the subject, but I cant seem to find a definitive answer. I am either missing something vital here or this isnt possible and Im just wasting your time. Here goesp  pImagine a database, which stores lets say only a 1000 rows, consisting of an id, a boolean value 0 or 1 that must be at some point changed and a constant string value with some information. The information can be accessed and the value may be changed ONLY if the user has commited a required action in the client java app. That only there is vital.p  pDuring my worldwideweb search, I came across two options that could suit my needs.p  ol lipSet permission for each user on the database itself, and have users log in from the app using their own username and password. The client app can then communicate with the database as the user wishes, performing the tasks of reading and writing to the database as required.pli lipUse the threetier approach, having the java app communicate with a PHP interface that executes the query and returns an encoded json string of a sorts, which the java app can parse. I get the basic concept, you send the username and password of the client to the PHP interface which checks if the client is eligible and executes the query accordingly. No biggie. pli ol  pWhat I cant seem to figure out is how to let only the java client change and retrieve the data. For example, should someone want to know what the contents of the strings are in approach 1, they could simply use their username and password and query the database directly. The queries are easy enough to get from the java app after decompililng. As for 2, if the app is decompiled, the PHP interface can also be reverseengineered, allowing a user to query the database by exploiting the PHP script, even without knowing the actual password and username for the database. p  pI have to point out that the users are not trusted at all, and the contents of the database should remain a secret until certain conditions are met in the java app. Is there a way to acomplish that And if there is a way I am unaware of, I am most certainly not stuck on these two options. Thank you for all your help in advance.p

Negative 494 pI have created an AngularJS service that dynamically inserts a div into the DOM with content from a template and a custom controller that handles the bindings and directives within the template.

I DO NOT want the page to scroll, just display the div next to the link.  Nothing changes in the URL in the location.  If I scroll back down, I see the new div displayed.  If I click a different link with the codengclickcode, then no scrolling takes place which is what I wanted for the first click as well.  If I refresh the page, it doesnt matter which link I click first and the first click always causes the browser to scroll back to the top of the viewport.p  pIf I dont put the codengincludecode directive in my new element and just hardcode the HTML of the template in the service instead, the scroll to the top of the page on the first click DOES NOT happen.p  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.angularjs.orgaping.directive3angInclude relnofollowngInclude documentationa says that you can specify an optional codeautoscrollcode attribute and it says that if the attribute is not set, then it will disable autoscroll.

Negative 494 pSimple question I have an element with an ID. I want to attach the Dojo Datepicker control after page load to that element. When I click on that element the datepicker should appear. The API documentation lacks with that kind of approach. Did I miss something Do you have a solution Thanks in advancep  pUPDATEp  pTo be clear I dont want to attach the Datepicker to an input element but to a spandiv element text only. When I click on that element the datepicker should appear. The rest of coding should be done within the datepickers JS code change view etc.. I could use the jQuery Datepicker but I want to achieve a clear and unique user experience. Thats why I am asking for the Dojo way p

The Problem is on small display, you have to scroll from left to right to read long lines, which is suboptimal ralated to the usability.p  pNext i try to change all spaces to protected spaces codeampnbspcode, using codepregreplacecode. This keeps the table layout, but also the  text layout, because every space between every word is now protected.p  pFinally i tried to convert only multiple spaces, not single spaces, with the same number of protected HTML spaces, using those commandsp  precode replace odd number of spaces  stext  pregreplace   ,ampnbspampnbspampnbsp,stext  replace even number of spaces  stext  pregreplace  ,ampnbspampnbsp,stext codepre  pSo the text is floating  responsive and some tables keep there structure.

Negative 494 pi have a small visualization framework written in c and want to use Qt to have a proper GUI and control over my visualizations to interact with them. currently i am using GLUT to create a window and draw a view in it. so everything i do is initialize an object of the class Visualization which does everything for me holding model and views. view itself holds a controller to process user input and manipulate the model. my main loop looks like thisp  precodeVisualization vis  new Visualization visgtcreateModelsomefile.txt visgtcreateViewunknown   ...  void demoappdisplay     clear the framebuffer   glClearColor0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1.0   glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT    vis.update  looks for dirty scenes to update   vis.render  draws all views which are stored in vis    glutSwapBuffers  codepre  pwith GLUT i have a single window in which i arrange multiple views. when i order the view to draw during the main loop i can execute glCommands and everything is fine.p  pso now my problem is i want to use Qt with several windows codeQDialogscodecodeQGLWidgetscode. i am familiar with Qt and i already ported the framework to Qt. but the problem is that i have to do too much Qt integration within the framework and this is not what i want. i want to control the visualization with Qt and its GUI elements, but the draw call for a view should be made by my Visualization class as shown by the GLUT example. So there must be a way to give an inherited codeQGLWidgetcode a pointer to a view object and whenever the view should be drawn the widget has to call codemakeCurrentcode so the glCommands can draw on the context. i also can use a texture in which my view paints the current scene and then draw the texture in the paintGL or codeglDrawcode function of the codeQGLWidgetcode, but how can i tell the Widget to codeupdatecode when the view has no knowledge about it. i will emulate the main loop with a codeQTimercode set to 0. all i want to do is to by able to trigger the rendering of the codeQGLWidgetcode from inside my framework. any suggestion links examplesp

I can specify the file extensions and max file size and it indeed works. The problem is as followsp  ol liI specify the max file size as 100mbli liWhen user uploads 110mb the file I can see that codeJakartaMultiPartRequestcode class handles the file upload with the help common codefileuploadcode libraries. This happens BEFORE the file upload interceptor.li liOnce the user waited for minutes and the file upload is done the file upload interceptor fires and tells the user that the file is too big.li ol  pThere is something wrong with sequence of events. I would like to looks at contentlength header and right away tell the user that the file is too big before uploading. I understand the header is not always there but if it is there I would like to use it.p  pOther than overwriting codeJakartaMultiPartRequestcode class I dont understand how to do this.p  pEdit Here is the sequence as I understand it.p  ol liUser sends multipart request to server with file upload.li liJakartaMultiPartRequest in Struts2 parses the request and uploads it to Struts2 temp folder.li liThe flow finally reaches the fileupload interceptor where max file size and file extension is checked.li ol  pFrom above it is obvious that the upload happened at step2. The entire file is now on server and only after that fileupload interceptor detects that it is too big.p

Negative 494 pI am attempting to write a shell in C, but am running into a problem. The shell is supposed to operate in a loop, prompting the user each time, each time reading and parsing text from stdin. The argument is then divided up into tokens, and places each token into an argument vector. The code then forks a child, and then runs a command using the argument vectors as parameters. The code then waits for the child to terminate, and prints statistics about the child runtime, etc. The problem is, whenever we run the program, when we enter ls home for example, it does not list the home directory, instead it lists the directory that we are currently in. In addition, if we try to add a new variable to the code, the code stops working.

Negative 494 pMy website has been working for months using https then suddenly pages started missing elements js,css,png,etc randomly for example FFox reported jquery.min.js as having 0b, Chrome displayed x.png strongGET Failed pendingstrong, etc., which would suddenly reappear doing a refresh. Or, sometimes the browser just reports page not available.p  pThis is hosted with godaddy and the cert is issued by them. After hours of talking to support, checking the server and whatnot, they said it could be a problem with the certificate and then said it was OK.p  pBut then I started accessing the pages with http, and sure enough, problems disappeared. Now Ive hit a wall, because GD says theres nothing wrong on their side... [they suggested deleting the cert, or that I should go back and check my coding].p  pQuestion is is there a way to pinpoint if the cert is blocking some GET, or any ideas to explain this weird behaviorp  pTnx.p  p Morep  pUpon succesive Refresh, the page is missing some files randomly in the Chrome network trace, the ones that are not loaded are those that take more than 20s, seems like just a timeout. So, it looks like the httpssslcert is screwing the transmission. But I still have no clue why.p  pno, its not my local connection happens in other locationsp

Negative 494 pI am trying to figure out the best way for a QML object to send out a signal and for many other QML elements to respond to it. Normally, if you create codesignal mySignalcode then you have a handler automatically created for you called codeonMySignalcode but that handler exists only within the same element that created the signal.p  pA particularly inelegant solution could be to store an array of QML elements you want updated when a signal occurs, and then in your handler you loop through all those elements and do what you need.p  pId be surprised if there wasnt an easier way.

Negative 494 pI am attempting to parallelize an algorithm that I have been working on using the Multiprocessing and Pool.map commands. I ran into a problem and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction.p  pLet x denote an array of N rows and 1 column, which is initialized to be a vector of zeros. Let C denote an array of length N by 2. The vector x is constructed iteratively by using information from some subsets of C doing some math operations. The code not parallelized as a large for loop looks roughly as followsp  precodefor j in range0,N    indxj will have nj ltltN entries     indxj  buildindicesC,j     xj will be entries to be added to vector x at indices indxj    This part is time consuming    xj  buildxjindxj,C     Add xj into entries of x    x[indxj]  x[indxj]  xj codepre  pI was able to parallelize this using the multiprocessing module and using the pool.map to eliminate the large for loop. I wrote a function that did the above computations, except  the step of adding xj to x[indxj]. The parallelized function instead returns two data sets back xj and indxj. After those are computed, I run a for loop not parallel to build up x by doing the x[indxj]  x[indxj] xj computation for j0,N.p  pThe downside to my method is that pool.map operation returns a gigantic list of N pairs of arrays xj and indxj. where both xj and indxj were nj by 1 vectors nj ltlt N. For large N N 20,000 this was taking up way too much memory. Here is my question Can I somehow, in parallel, do the construction operation x[indxj]  x[indxj]  xj. It seems to me each process in pool.map would have to be able to interact with the vector x. Do I place x in some sort of shared memory How would I do such a thing I suspect that this has to be possible somehow, as I assume people assemble matrices in parallel for finite element methods all the time. How can I have multiple processes interact with a vector without having some sort of problem Im worried that perhaps for j 20 and j  23, if they happen simultaneously, they might try to add to x[indx20]  x[indx20]  x20   and simultaneously x[indx30]  x[indx30]  x30 and maybe some error will happen. I also dont know how to even have this computation done via the pool.map I dont think I can feed x in as an input, as it would be changing after each process.p  pIm not sure if it matters or not, but the sets indxj will have nontrivial intersection e.g., indx1 and indx2 may have indices [1,2,3] and [3,4,5] for example.p  pIf this is unclear, please let me know and I will attempt to clarify. This is my first time trying to work in parallel, so I am very unsure of how to proceed. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 494 pIm a bit confused with pending intents in the notification builder. Ive got a codeMainActivitycode activity and a codeMessageListcode activity. I have a service to show a notification when a new message in found, and I want it to be that if the user presses the notification it opens to the codeMessageListcode activity but when they press back they will return to the activity they were in.p  pEssentially I want to add codeMessageListcode activity to the top of the activity stack when they press the notification without modifying the current activity stack.p  pThank youp

Im not managing wakelocks because codeAlarmManagercode keeps device awake until codeonReceivecode method finishes, and the work I have to do there is very light. My codeonAlarmReceivercode class is thisp  precodepackage bembibre.coolstar.windowsmobilewidget.backend.alarms  import bembibre.coolstar.windowsmobilewidget.ExtendedAppWidgetProvider import bembibre.coolstar.windowsmobilewidget.ListItemClickService import android.content.BroadcastReceiver import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent  public class OnAlarmReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver      Override     public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent          ExtendedAppWidgetProvider.setDayChangeAlarmcontext          new ListItemClickcontext.update       codepre  pThe method codeupdatecode is very light. Ive read that what I should do is to make codeListItemClickcode an IntentService, acquire a wakelock before calling codeupdatecode, start the codeIntentServicecode, and inside of it, when it finishes, release the wakelock. But this wakelock would be mine. The AlarmManager not released wakelock would continue keeping device awake until the infinite. So I dont understand nothing. It is supposed that if there are two wakelocks, the AlarmManager wakelock and the mine, and I release the mine, the AlarmManager wakelock would continue unreleased.p
Negative 494 pIm attempting to follow this deceptively simple tutorial on MSDN for making an Excel 2013 web appp  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comlibraryofficefp14225528voffice.1529 relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comlibraryofficefp14225528voffice.1529ap  pIm stuck on the To specify a trusted location for the manifest and To test and run the Hello World app steps.  I dont have a network share nor a SharePoint server available.  I dont know why I cant simply just point to the manifest file itself somewhere and load the target application directly and ideally not have to restart Excel after each little change to see if it works.  Im not sure what the actual problem is since the only output I see is a vague Cannot connect to catalog message when I go to find and insert the app into Excel.  The Trust Center dialog in Excel actively refuses local drive references e.g. Cpathtoapp with a message about needing https.  Excel did accept .[driveletter]pathtoapp as a valid network share a bug but it still displays the Cannot connect to catalog message in the insert dialog.  Ive also tried variants on the theme such as excluding the trailing backslash  from the path and specifying the full path and filename of the app and various combinations of app directory and filenames.p  pI also attempted to throw the test app up on both a local and remote web server and then pointed Excel at the manifest as well as the apps directory, but the web server logs indicate that Excel is attempting to connect to a SharePoint REST API endpoint pathtoapp[appname.xml]apiweblistsfilterTemplateFeatureId20eq20guid61e874cd3ac34531862828c3acb78279ampselectId, which results in a 404 i.e. not a SharePoint server and then Excel displays the unhelpful Cannot connect to catalog message.  The server logs at least proved that Excel was actually doing something and the Trust Center did at least warn me it was going to treat the URL as a SharePoint URL.  However, theres no obvious way to tell Excel to load an individual app from a plainol web server instead of SharePoint nor what the web servers reply should be if I dont have nor desire nor the capability e.g. a Linux server to install SharePoint.p  pSo what am I missing or doing wrong  Making an Excel web app on a local computer is something sensible the developer of the web app might want to do.  Letting users install the web app via a direct URL is also something sensible that a developer might want to do.p

Negative 494 pI am aware that I can use File Reader class. But I am confused on the implementation when it comes to reading separate sections of text within a line.p  pEach line in the file will have names first and last name separated by an empty space, but a comma is used to delimited the UKNOWN set of full names. A semicolon is then used to to separate the section within the line. The next section is consisted of names of streets each street name is delimited by a comma as well. p  pWhat I want to do is read the full names into an ArrayList of strings, when the semicolon is reached, the street names should be inserted into a separate ArrayList of strings.p  pIf I could get a brief example of how to go on about the implementation, I could the entire thing on my own. p  pNOTE It must read from a text file. Each line will be a separate test case of full names, and street names. p  pEDITp  pHere is a sample of the input James Cooper ,John Evans,Abe LincolnJackson st,No way,Aspen Wayp  pOutput The array list of names holds  James Cooper , John Evans, Abe Lincoln each separated by commasp  pThe array list of street names holds   Jackson st,No way,Aspen Way each separated by commasp
Negative 494 pI have a website thats more of an application, with two pages. Its incredibly javascript heavy and most of the times the two pages have nothing to do with each other.p  pHowever, recently Ive had the need to be able to send users from one page to the other.

I know I can set a bunch of URL parameters after the page redirect, that will describe what to load, but I want the url clean.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pI have two pages Employee profile employee.php and Tasks tasks.php.

The usernames are then clickable and when an admin clicks the user I want the following to happenp  ol liRedirect the user from tasks.php to employee.phpli liRun the JSfunction loadUserProfileidli ol  pHow can I achieve this without using GET parameters Is there a general best practice way of cross application navigation I should be aware ofp

Negative 494 pIn angularjs we pass parameters as dependency injection. For example,p  precodefunction checkInCtrl scope, rootScope, location, http .. .  codepre  pSo when it gets minified, it becomes like,p  precodefunction checkInCtrla,b,c,d  codepre  pNow a,b,c,d wont be interpreted as scope, rootScope, location, http respectively by angular and whole code fails to work. For this angularjs has provided one solution, which is p  precodecheckInCtrl.inject  [scope, rootScope, location, http] codepre  pwe can inject different dependencies by using above syntax. This worked well till I didnt use some custom angular service as dependency. So for example ,p  pif I have something like p  precodefunction checkInCtrl scope, rootScope, location, http .. .  codepre  pIt works with given solution, but if I have something likep  precodefunction checkInCtrl scope, rootScope, location, http, customService .. .  codepre  pWhere customService is something likep  precodeangular.modulecustomService, [ngResource]                 .factoryabc, functionresource                                  return resourceabc                  codepre  pIts minified version doesnt get interpreted properly by angular. p  pAs we had to start project development activities, we couldnt spend enough time to look into matter and we started using controller without minifying them. So first question is whether there is such problem with angular or I made some mistake and due to which it didnt work If such issue exist,what is solution to itp

So the data is now stored in a database. I then want Activity B to retrieve the Activity A data from the database and use it for certain calculations in Activity B. pli lipThe data that the user enters, I want it to stay on the screen once the user enters it, closes the app, and then reopens the app. I assume this has also to do with the database. Right now, once I enter in the data in Activity A, then navigate to Activity B, and then come back to Activity A and the data is gone. pli ol  pI am not looking for the exact code to make this work. I am looking for mostly how the database works and if I can even do the 2 things that I mentioned above. I would really appreciate it if someone could explain this to me.p

Negative 494 pThere is quite a bit of talk about how to crop an image taken from Gallery or Camera. A very simple one, which not many people like, includes the following snippetp  precodeintent.putExtracrop, true intent.putExtraaspectX, 617 intent.putExtraaspectY, 619 codepre  pAnyway, the snippet is meant to be incomplete. Moving on...p  pNotice how in the snippet I use two large prime numbers. I was here hoping to restrict the minimum crop dimension. 617X619 seems to have no effect, however which to me basically means whatever algorithm is been used has such function similar top  precodedouble scale   double aspectYaspectX codepre  pwhich is then used to match xDimen against yDimen.p  pBut before throwing my hands in the air and giving up, I noticed that instagram has successfully managed to restrict the minimum dimension of the cropper. Does anyone know how I might accomplish this Basically if you use instagram, you will notice that you cannot crop a too small portion of an image. How might I decide those dimensionsp  pBasically its as if instagram is doingp  precode  double scale   double aspectYaspectX   ....   ifsomeInputX gt aspectX     xDimen  someInputX     yDimen  scale xDimen   else     do not crop any further    codepre  pI have been looking at a few cropping libraries to see if I can figure out how to fix the minimum dimensions, but I cant seem to figure it out. I have for example been studying the git projects linked to by a hrefhttpcommonsware.comblog20130123noandroiddoesnothavecropintent.html relnofollowhttpcommonsware.comblog20130123noandroiddoesnothavecropintent.htmlap

Negative 494 pIm reading a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa21303928vsql.8029.aspx relnofollowUnderstanding Locking in SQL Servera. But I dont quite understand the purpose of update locks.p  pDetails description as belowp  blockquote   pUpdate Locksp      pUpdate U locks prevent a common form of deadlock. A typical update pattern consists of a transaction reading a record, acquiring a shared S lock on the resource  page or row, and then modifying the row, which requires lock conversion to an exclusive X lock. If two transactions acquire sharedmode locks on a resource and then attempt to update data concurrently, one transaction attempts the lock conversion to an exclusive X lock. The sharedmodetoexclusive lock conversion must wait because the exclusive lock for one transaction is not compatible with the sharedmode lock of the other transaction a lock wait occurs. The second transaction attempts to acquire an exclusive X lock for its update. Because both transactions are converting to exclusive X locks, and they are each waiting for the other transaction to release its sharedmode lock, a deadlock occurs.p      pTo avoid this potential deadlock problem, update U locks are used. Only one transaction can obtain an update U lock to a resource at a time. If a transaction modifies a resource, the update U lock is converted to an exclusive X lock. Otherwise, the lock is converted to a sharedmode lock.p blockquote  pConsider below two transactionboth transaction execute at codeIsolation Level Repeatable Readcode in order to hold S lock during transactionp  pexecute below SQL in TRAN1.p  precodeBEGIN TRAN SELECT BrandName FROM dbo.Brand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pnow, TRAN1 grant S lock for RIDp  pexecute below SQL in TRAN2p  precode BEGIN TRAN  SELECT BrandName FROM dbo.Brand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pnow, TRAN2 grant S lock for same RID resource as TRAN1p  pexecute below SQL in TRAN1p  precodeUPDATE dbo.Brand SET BrandNameYBrand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pnow, TRAN1 S lock convert to U lock and the U lock wait TRAN2 S lock release to convert to X lock p  pexecute below SQL in TRAN2p  precodeUPDATE dbo.Brand SET BrandNameZBrand WHERE BrandId2 codepre  pThen deadlock occurs.p  pUp deadlock is exactly as description as what U lock use for prevent. But deadlock still occurs. p  pSo my question is what U lock different with X lock And which situation make it can prevent deadlock instead of use X lockp

Negative 494 pSo I do logging.config.fileConfig to setup my logging from a file config that has console and file handler. Then I do logging.getLoggername to get my logger and log. At certain times I want the filehandlers filename to change i.e. log rotate I cant use time rotator because of some issues with Windows platform so to do that I call logger.handlers  it shows an empty list, so I cant close them However when I step through the debugger, its clearly not empty well of course without it I wouldnt be able to log rightp  pNot sure whats going on here, any gotchas that Im missingp  pAppreciate any help.

Negative 494 pIm trying to trigger a visual state with the help of the Behavior SDK. The current state of a Flyout showhide should depend on the value of codeFlyoutIsVisiblecode in the ViewModel.

Which is far too long to be useful. About those emem steps, I tried to annul 5th step as those borders are for cosmetic purposes only and it just speeds it up by 4 secs took 26 secs to load. And I also tried cancelling the last step which is actually crucial and then in takes 20 seconds, which is also not acceptable.p  pAnother thing I tried was creating a custom TextView to shorten the code and neglecting those repeating steps which turned out to be much less efficient so I took it back.p  pSo, what am I doing wrong Is it not possible to generate an Excel style table with hundreds of rows in 23 seconds Its pretty trivial in a simple Windows Form application AFAIK.p  pHeres the output by the way ignore the buttons and stuffp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.como7JnQ.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 494 pI have a server and two different clients. Server and clients will comunicate between them via FIFO. Each client first send to server a struct variable which contains clientpid and a number. Number serves to distinguish client. Then server makes adeguate fifos for each client. After establishing this, server sends a different message to each client. When i run server and clients, clients dont get the message, they hang on read. Why its happening and what should i do to fix it For this example, i simplified the clients, theyre allmost the same, except the number that they pass to the server to distinguish themselves. In the original program two client will be doing different things and they will receive different data from server, thats why i need to distinguish them.p  pserver.cp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt include lterrno.hgt include ltassert.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsysstat.hgt include ltsyswait.hgt include ltsysun.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include ltarpainet.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt   define ecneg1s,m ifs  1 perrorm exiterrno  define SERVERFIFONAME fifoserver define PERMFILE        0664  struct acknow   pidt clientpid  int num    int makefifonamepidt pid, char name, sizet namemax   snprintfname, namemax, fifold, longpid  return 0     int main   int fdserver  int fdsend  int fdrecv  ssizet nread  struct acknow acknow   char fifosend[100]  char fiforecv[100]   char msg1[100]  SENDER GOT THE MESSAGEn  char msg2[100]  RECEIVER GOT THE MESSAGEn   printfserver is startedn   ifmkfifoSERVERFIFONAME, PERMFILE  1 ampamp errno  EEXIST   perrorcant make fifo exiterrno     ecneg1 fdserver  openSERVERFIFONAME, ORDWR, cant open fdserver     while1        ecneg1 nread  readfdserver, ampacknow, sizeofacknow, cant read from fdserver     if nread  0             errno  ENETDOWN       perrornread  0 exiterrno           ifacknow.num  1  senders pid arrived first              MAKE FIFO OF THE SENDER       makefifonameacknow.clientpid, fifosend, sizeoffifosend        ecneg1fdsend  openfifosend, OWRONLY, cant open fifosend         GET PID OF THE RECEIVER         ecneg1 nread  readfdserver, ampacknow, sizeofacknow, cant read from fdserver        if nread  0                 errno  ENETDOWN         perrornread  0 exiterrno                MAKE FIFO OF THE RECEIVER       makefifonameacknow.clientpid, fiforecv, sizeoffiforecv        ecneg1 fdrecv  openfiforecv, OWRONLY, cant open fiforecv            else  receivers pid arrived first              MAKE FIFO OF THE SENDER       makefifonameacknow.clientpid, fiforecv, sizeoffiforecv        ecneg1fdrecv  openfiforecv, OWRONLY, cant open fiforecv         GET PID OF THE RECEIVER         ecneg1 nread  readfdserver, ampacknow, sizeofacknow, cant read from fdserver        if nread  0                 errno  ENETDOWN         perrornread  0 exiterrno               MAKE FIFO OF THE RECEIVER       makefifonameacknow.clientpid, fifosend, sizeoffifosend        ecneg1 fdsend  openfifosend, OWRONLY, cant open fifoname              printfsending message to sendern     ecneg1 writefdsend, ampmsg1, sizeofmsg1, cant write to fdsend      printfsending message to receivern     ecneg1 writefdrecv, ampmsg2, sizeofmsg2, cant write to fdrecv      ecneg1 closefdsend, cant close fdsend      ecneg1 closefdrecv, cant close fdrecv       printfdonen      ecneg1 closefdserver, cant close fdserver       return 0  codepre  pClient1.c here i post only Client1, Client2 is simply the same code, just change the acknow.num  to the 2 if you want to run them.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt include lterrno.hgt include ltassert.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsysstat.hgt include ltsyswait.hgt include ltsysun.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include ltarpainet.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt    define ecneg1s,m ifs  1 perrorm exiterrno  define SERVERFIFONAME fifoserver define PERMFILE        0664   struct acknow   pidt clientpid  int num    int makefifonamepidt pid, char name, sizet namemax  snprintfname, namemax, fifold, longpid return 0    int main   int fdserver, fdclient ssizet nread char fifoname[100] char msg[100] struct acknow acknow   printfclient1 startedn  acknow.clientpid  getpid acknow.num  1   makefifonameacknow.clientpid, fifoname, sizeoffifoname  if mkfifofifoname, PERMFILE  1 ampamp errno  EEXIST   perrorcant make fifo exiterrno   ecneg1 fdserver  openSERVERFIFONAME, OWRONLY, cant open fdserver   ecneg1 writefdserver, ampacknow, sizeofacknow,cant write to fdserver   ecneg1 fdclient  openfifoname, ORDWR, cant open fifoname     whilenread  read0, ampmsg, sizeofmsg     write1, msg, nread    if nread  0     errno  ENETDOWN   perrornread  0 exiterrno  if nread  1   perrorcant read exiterrno     ecneg1 closefdserver, cant close fdserver   ecneg1 closefdclient, cant close fdclient   ecneg1 unlinkfifoname, cant unlink fifoname     return 0  codepre

Negative 494 pSo Ive been developing with a companys private SDK recently, and basically their SDK acts as another input form for the user. Im using SpriteKit and their SDK for the input to make a game, but theres one last bug preventing me from finishing.p  pThe eventtriggered method called every time input occurs just stops being called at random times, even when there is valid input. I dont think the fault is with the SDK, since Ive seen many examples of it working fine. Ive ran the allocation instrument during debugging, and the bug occurs even when no major allocations are occurring. Im posting here to ask for advice not necessarily on how to fix the bug, but on how to debug it, since obviously not much information about the SDK can be given here. p  pThis might be a problem with SpriteKit andor how Im using SpriteKite.

Negative 494 pOn the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdE194550180652576je9h0347index.htmlguideix965 relnofollowOracle docs for multithreadinga they have this paragraph about deadlocks when trying to require a lockp  blockquote   pBecause there is no guaranteed order in which locks are acquired, a   problem in threaded programs is that a particular thread never   acquires a lock, even though it seems that it should.p      pThis usually happens when the thread that holds the lock releases it,   lets a small amount of time pass, and then reacquires it. Because the   lock was released, it might seem that the other thread should acquire   the lock. But, because nothing blocks the thread holding the lock, it   continues to run from the time it releases the lock until it   reacquires the lock, and so no other thread is run.p blockquote  pJust to make sure I understood this, I tried to write this out in code let me know if this is a correct interpretationp    pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltmutexgt include ltchronogt include ltthreadgt include ltiostreamgt  stdmutex m  void f      stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockm  acquire the lock     stdcout ltlt stdthisthreadgetid ltlt  now has the mutexn      lock.unlock  release the lock     stdthisthreadsleepforstdchronoseconds2  sleep for a while      lock.lock  reacquire the lock     stdcout ltlt stdthisthreadgetid ltlt  has the mutex after sleepn   int main      stdthreadf.join  thread A     stdthreadf.join  thread B  codepre  pSo what the quote above is saying is that the time during which the lock is released and the thread is sleeping like the code above is not sufficient to guarantee a thread waiting on the lock to acquire it How does this relate to deadlocksp

Negative 494 pI use the SingleTask activity in my Workflow to create Tasks for the User. But I need to give the User more information than just Body, Title, DueDate and AssignTo. So I created a Content Type which inherits from Workflow Task SP2013 and it has a Site Column called TestField. So when the Single Task is created, I want to programatically add the TestFieldfield as soon as this Task is created. But I also need to wait for completion of the Task to continue with the Workflow. The TestField field value is needed for the Task to get finished, so I cant add it after the completion of the task. I need to give this Value to the Task afterwhile creation. Is this possible Any idea Can anybody help mep

Negative 494 pIm starting to learn how to do testdriven development, and Im working with Swift. Im suppose to have a test which should fail then write the code needed to get it to pass. From my understanding the test should successfully run, just fail. However, in Swift, when I try to write a test that, say, checks the value of a objects specific attribute, if that class doesnt yet have such an attribute because Im suppose to write the test first before I create it for that class I dont get a failing test, but instead a build error when attempting to build and run the test. The error is that the test is trying to access an attribute that doesnt exist for the given object. Am I going about this the wrong way Or are these test build breaking errors suppose to be what I get when doing TDD in Swift Thanksp

Right now, Im struggling with the method that counts the frequency of words that appears in a .txt file.p  pI have a set of text files in both English and French in their respective folders labeled 120. The method asks for a directory which in this case is docstraineng or docstrainfre and for how many files that the program should go through there are 20 files in each folder. Then it reads that file, splits all the words apart I dont need to worry about capitalization or punctuation, and puts every word in a HashMap along with how many times they were in the file. Key  word, Value  frequency.p  pThis is the code I came up with for the methodp  precodepublic static HashMapltString, Integergt countWordsString directory, int nFiles   Declare the HashMap HashMapltString, Integergt wordCount  new HashMap   this large for loop will go through each file in the specified directory. for int k  1 k lt nFiles k     Puts together the string that the FileReader will refer to.

If so, just increments the value      if wordCount.containsKeywords[i]                 wordCount.putwords[i], freq           Otherwise, puts the word into the HashMap     else        wordCount.putwords[i], freq            Catching the file not found error    and any other errors  catch FileNotFoundException fnfe    System.err.printlnFile not found.  catch Exception e    System.err.printe       return wordCount  codepre  pThe code compiles. Unfortunately, when I asked it to print the results of all the word counts for the 20 files, a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous21a4b5987e1673db882d relnofollowit printed thisa. Its complete gibberish though the words are definitely there and is not at all what I need the method to do. p  pIf anyone could help me debug my code, I would greatly appreciate it. Ive been at it for ages, conducting test after test and Im ready to give up.p

Negative 494 pI am attempting to count word pairs in a text file. My goal is to map every word in the string to the word that follows it, and then count the duplicate keyvalue pairs. I am not concerned with the order. My code currently is using HashMap to store each word pair but using HashMap I lose duplicate entries. If my text file contains codeFIRST SECOND THIRD FIRST SECONDcode I will get for my output codeFIRST [SECOND] SECOND[] THIRD [FIRST]code. So if I have a duplicate key the following string value overwrites what was previously there. Brandon Ling helped me earlier on a previous post, however I was not clear with him on my goal.

Negative 494 pI have a C homework to do, this is the questionp  precodeDietel amp Dietel C Programming Chapter 6 Arrays Page 241 Exercise 6.19  Write a program that simulates the rolling of two dice.    The program should use rand to roll the first die, and   should use rand again to roll the second die.    The sum of the two values should then be calculated. Note Since each die   can show an integer value from 1 to 6, then the sum of the two values will vary  from 2 to 12 with 7 being the most freqent sum and 2 and 12 being the least frequent  sums. Figure 6.23 shows the 36 possible combinations of the two dice.    Your program should  roll the two dice 36,000 times. Use a singlescripted array to tally the numbers of times   each possible sum appears.    Print the results in a tabular format. Also, determine if the totals   are resonable i.e there are six ways to roll a 7, so approximately one sixth of all of the  rolls should be 7.   codepre  pI created the program, but it gives me the output like thisp  precodesum of Faces    Frequency       2            0       3         4041       4            0       5         7922       6            0       7        12154       8            0       9         7936      10            0      11         3948      12            0 sum 36001 codepre  pI dont why its giving 0 frequency for all even numbersp  pHeres what I coded so farp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt includeltiomanipgt using namespace std  int main       const int arraysize  13      int counter[13], sum0      init counter     forint i0 ilt13 i         counter[i]  0      int die1      int die2      for  int roll1  0 roll1 lt36000 roll1           die1   1  rand  6         die2   1  rand  6         counter[die1die2]           coutltltsum of Facesltltsetw13ltltFrequencyltltendl      forint face2 faceltarraysizeface              coutltltsetw7ltltfaceltltsetw13ltltcounter[face]ltltendl         sum  counter[face]           cout ltlt sum  ltlt sum       return 0  codepre  pI need to add possibilities for the dice as well, examplep  precode1  1  2  1 possibility for sum to be 2 1  2  2  1  3  2 possibility for sum to be 3 1  3  2  2  3  1  4  3 possibility for sum to be 4 . . . 6  6  12  1 possibility for sum to be 12 codepre

Negative 494 pI am pretty new to socket.io and have written my first app in nodeexpresssocket.io.  Right now everything works great on my nginx server.  I want to release my app to the public, but I am gripped with the fear that it just wont work for a lot of people.  I have had a few friends test my app and everything went smoothly it is a pretty simple app.  Here is my concern  Right now every connection seems to be using websockets, which is what i want.  But will my app sometimes downgrade to polling due to something weird on the clients end  If so, how does socket.io decide when to use polling and when to use websocket is it based on browserversion or connection or what  I am pretty sure it uses websocket when possible, but is there a list somewhere of conditions that will knock it down to polling  Also, is there a way I can test my application for by using polling to see if it worksp  pI can post code, but I think this is a general question on how socket.io works.p

Negative 494 pI am facing a problem where I need to a identify whether an OPCAE client has previously connected to the OPCAE server which I am writing. The reason I need this is to make sure the client doesnt miss any alarms while it was disconnected by caching alarms in the server and then as the client reconnects, do a Refresh with the missed alarms if the previous subscriptions included those alarms. There is no such requirement in the OPC AE spec to catch alarms while disconnected.p  pIn the previous version of the OPCAE server it made all subscription handles unique for a client, so client A would say use client handles 1100 and client 2 would use 101200 or something, this only works if the client is a custom one knowing what range they are allowed to use, connecting with say Matrikon OPC AE explorer could potentially reuse some of those handles.p  pIs there some standard way to handle this When regarding the OPC there is the interface codeIOPCCommoncode with a method called codeSetClientNamecode but that seems to be a more of an ad hoc way for a client to identify itself, if you start two OPC clients on the same PC they will get the same name at least with Matrikon Explorer it seems so.p  pClients can also connect remotely to the server via DCOM.p  pIs there maybe some way in the IConnectionPoint to identify a client that previously connectedp

Negative 494 pGreetings StrackOverflow.p  pI am these days working on a project using AngularJS. One of the requirements is having a button that manipulates the url and redirects the web browser to another page. The url must also remember the parameters I have filled in on the first page for instance, a checkbox and a few text inputs that can have multiple values the scopevariable will thus be an array. p  pLets call page one input, and the second one result.p  pAn example result would bep  precodelocalhost8000fooresultparam1helloampparam2trueampparam3aampparam3bampparam3c codepre  pIn AngularJS, I have found location, which can be used to manipulate the address barurl. Unfortunately, it doesnt make my browser reload with the new content, so I also call upon location.replace.p  pThis causes another undesired bug While I get to the resultpage, I get two new entries in the browser history instead of one, and after jumping twice to reach the inputpage by clicking the browsers backbutton, I need to manually reload it, since the history between the first page and the first change to the new one is merely a change in the url, without page reload. Apparently the browser remembers the difference between mere urlchanges and proper page loads. In other words I get a duplicate entry of the resulting page, including parameters, in the browsers history.p  pNow, for the sample codep  precodescope.buttonExecute function      location.url..fooresult      location.search         param1 scope.input1,         param2 scope.input2,         param3 scope.input3           location.replacelocation.url   codepre  pLet me have it said, I get the correct url and the parameters to work. My problem is that by using location.url and location.search, I get an extra entry into my browser history. I have to hit the backbutton twice, and also do a manual reload to get to the original inputpage.p  pWhat I want As soon as I click the button that runs buttonExecute, I get the resulting page with correct parameters, AND then get back to the input page with only one click on the backbutton, without needing to reload manually.p  pI have made a few attempts at working around this problem. One is using replace, by adding it to both location.url and location.searh, but that didnt work. Turns out it replaced the inputpages entry in the history.p  pThe second was to manipulate the history itself, and didnt work either, though it could be because I did it incorrectly, therefore I will show some sample codep  precodevar previousTitle, previousUrl  previousTitle  document.title previousUrl  document.URL  location.url and location.search runs here  history.replaceStatepage1, previousTitle, previousUrl  OR history.replaceStatenull, previousTitle, previousUrl  location.replacelocation.url codepre  pWhat I tried here was to replace the first of the duplicated history entries from the new page with the previous page, so that I can get back immediately when hitting the backbutton. Though I do realize at this point that this probably will create a ducplicate of the first page instead.p  pSo, users on StackOverflow, my question remains Is there a way I can use location to change the url and fill in the parameters with values, and load the new page without causing the duplication in the webbrowsers history  Do I have to manipulate the history after using location Any other recommendationsp  pOf course, all I technically need is the location.replacemethod on the end, and code the rest manually by building a urlstring, by looping through the parameter values. But then this will increase the required amount of work needed if I add other parameters to the input page param4, param5, etc, which is precisely what I want to avoid by using location.p  pSo, what are your answersp

Negative 494 pI have huge project and in some point of extending it I want to do something codethiscode in subclass codeYcode which inherits from codeXcode pointing to codeXcode when method from codeYcode called from codeXcode  I cant interfere to much in class structure and I want to do it NICELY without any helpers, additional constructor parameters with controller path or something like that.p  pSo the problem is when I instantiate codeControllerGallerycode it calls constructor which calls parent contructor from codeControllerResourcecode which is parent of codeControllerGallerycode. But in parent constructor codeControllerResourcecode, variable codethiscode is pointing to codeControllerGallerycode, not codeControllerResourcecode.p  pI know that when I instantiate class, there is only one object which is created only codeControllerGallerycode, not codeControllerGallerycode and its parent codeControllerResourcecode, and thats the problem.

Negative 494 pI need to binary serialize an object that contains a collection of lots of instances of some base class. Each instance could be any of the derived types, and there are really lots of possible derived types around one hundred. Therefore I dont really want to modify each of these types so that this object could be serialized.p  pI would even like to avoid adding the default public constructor to all of these types as this would damage the architecture a little bit and would also be really annoying to do and not really a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDon39trepeatyourself relnofollowDRYa, not speaking of adding codeSerializablecode attribute to every public property in these types. And for the same reason writing a custom serializersurrogate for each of these types is hardly an option.p  pWhat I have tried so farp  ul lia hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.serialization.formatters.binary.binaryformatter28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowBinaryFormattera  requires additional attributes for serialized propertiesli lia hrefhttpwww.sharpserializer.comenindex.html relnofollowsharpSerializera  requires public default constructorli lia hrefhttpsgithub.commgravellprotobufnet relnofollowprotobufneta  requires addtitional attributes for serialized propertiesli lia hrefhttpwww.taika.orgtombanetserializerindex.html relnofollowNet serializera  requires addtitional attributes for serialized propertiesli ul  pI have also tried serializing with a hrefhttpwww.newtonsoft.comjson relnofollowJson.NETa and then saving the result as a byte array I know, I know, but I ran into an codeOutOfMemoryExceptioncode while serializing. This likely means my object is too heavy for text serialization it takes around 200Mb in memory, but there are lots of elements in the array, lots of properties in each of the element etc. p  pIf it makes any better  all the objects in the collection I need to save have only public properties I dont need to serialize fields or private properties. And there also is no particular logic in these objects constructors  only filling the properies.p  pIs there any way to achieve the serializationdeserialization without modifying the serialized classesp  hr  pI dont even know if it is possible to deserialize an object that does not have parameterless constructor the restriction required by all of the serializers Ive met, but it should be as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions296584createobjectinstancewithoutinvokingconstructorthe reflection allows to create instances without calling constructors.ap
