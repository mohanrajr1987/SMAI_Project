Positive 4317 pI always thought that inlining always happens at compile time. But when I read this article by Herb Sutter a hrefhttpwww.drdobbs.cominlineredux184403879 relnofollowherea, he says that inlining can also happen at runtime. I was really surprised when I read that. Herb says in this article thatp  blockquote   pIt might seem impossible that inlining can still be performed at   runtime, but in fact there are several ways it can be done. In   particular, I want to mention profiledirected optimization and   guarded inlining. Like a managed environment see previous and next   sections, this requires some tool support to exist on the users   machine at runtime.p      pThe idea behind profiledirected optimization is that when the   application is actually run, instrumentation hooks inserted into the   executing program can gather data about how the program is actually   being used, in particular what functions are being called heavily and   under what conditions e.g., the size of the working set compared to   the total cache memory when the function is called. The data gathered   from these instrumented hooks can be used to modify the executable   image so that selected function calls can be inlined to tune the   application to its target environment based on actual runtime   performance measurements.p      pGuarded inlining is another example of how aggressive the runtime   inline optimizations can be. In particular, [4] and [5] document the   Jikes Research Virtual Machine RVM, ne the Jalapeo dynamic   optimizing compiler, for JVM targets. Among other things, this   compiler is able to inline virtual member functions by assuming that   the receiver of the virtual call will be of a given declared type in   order to avoid the cost not only of the function call but of the extra   expense of virtual dispatch. Now, compilers can already routinely   nonvirtualize and therefore also optionally inline certain virtual   function calls today, if the type of the target is statically known.   Whats new here is that the JikesJalapeo environment can   nonvirtualize and inline calls to virtual functions even if the static   type of the target is not known. Because the guess might not be right,   it inserts a guard that performs a runtime check that validates that   the target objects type is what was expected if its not, it falls   back to a normal virtual function call.p blockquote  pI still dont understand what exactly is profile directed optimization amp how it performed Same way what are instrumentation hooks amp who inserts them into executing program It would be also better if someone explain more clearly about guarded inlining. p

For one, its not necessarily obvious where all such methods are in the code, for another, I just dont like the syntax. I want to use . when I call methodsp  pA while ago I came up with the followingp  precodeclass StringBox  public    StringBox stdstringamp storage          storage storage               Methods I wish stdstring had...    void Format     void Split    double ToDouble     void Join  etc...  private   StringBox    stdstringamp storage  codepre  pNote that StringBox requires a reference to a stdstring for construction... This puts some interesting limits on its use and I hope, means it doesnt contribute to the string class proliferation problem... In my own code, Im almost always just declaring it on the stack in a method, just to modify a stdstring.p  pA use example might look like thisp  precodestring OperateOnString float num, string a, string b       string nameS     StringBox name nameS       name.Format fss, num, a.cstr, b.cstr       return nameS  codepre  pMy question is What do the C gurus of the StackOverflow community think of this method of STL extensionp

Negative 4317 pI have a web service that I want to access when it is added as a web reference to my C project.  A particular method in the web service takes a SQL query string and returns the results of the query as a custom type.

This is fine provided I can still somehow access the data returned from the query within those codeDataSetcode objects.  I ran a particular query that should return 6 rows I got back a codeDataSet[]code array with 6 elements.

I have access to the web service code should I do something to it to ensure codeSomeCustomTypecode can be cast to codeDataSet[]codep  pstrongEditstrong I feel like I could do better if I just got back the raw XML SOAP response from the web service.

Negative 4317 pGreetings to all the smart people around herep  pId like to ask whether it is feasible or a good idea at all to deploy a Java enterprise web application to a Cloud such as Amazon EC2. More exactly, Im looking for infrastructure options for an application that shall handle few hundred users with long but neither CPU nor memory intensive sessions. Im considering dedicated servers, virtual private servers VPSs and EC2. Ive noticed that there is a project called JBoss Cloud so people are working on enabling such a deployment, on the other hand it doesnt seem to be mature yet and Im not sure that the cloud is ready for this kind of applications, which differs from the typical cloudbased applications like Twitter. Would you recommend to deploy it to the cloud What are the pros and consp  pThe application is a Java EE 5 web application whose main function is to enable users to compose their own customized Product by combining the available Parts. It uses stateless and stateful session beans and JPA for persistence of entities to a RDBMS and fetches information about Parts from the companys inventory system via a web service. Aside of external users its used also by few internal ones, who are authenticated against the companys LDAP. The application should handle around 300400 concurrent users building their product and should be reasonably scalable and available though these qualities are only of a medium importance at this stage.p  pIve proposed an architecture consisting of a firewall FW and load balancer supporting sticky sessions and https in the Cloud this would be replaced with EC2s Elastic Load Balancing service and FW on the app. servers, in a physical architecture the loadbalancer would be a HW, then two physical clustered application servers combined with web servers so that if one fails, a user doesnt loose hisher long built product and finally a database server. The DB server would need a slave backup instance that can replace the master instance if it fails. This should provide reasonable availability and fault tolerance and provide good scalability as long as a single RDBMS can keep with the load, which should be OK for quite a while because most of the operations are done in the memory using a stateful bean and only occasionally stored or retrieved from the DB and the amount of data is low too. A problematic part could be the dependency on the remote inventory system webservice but with good caching of its outputs in the application it should be OK too.p  pUnfortunately Ive only vague idea of the system resources memory size, number and speed of CPUscores that such an average Java EE application for few hundred users needs. My rough and mostly unfounded estimate based on actual Amazon offerings is that 1.7GB and a single, 2core modern CPU with speed around 2.5GHz the HighCPU Medium Instance should be sufficient for any of the two application servers since we can handle higher load by provisioning more of them. Alternatively I would consider using the Large instance 64b, 7.5GB RAM, 2 cores at 1GHzp  pSo my question is whether such a deployment to the cloud is technically and financially feasible or whether dedicatedVPS servers would be a better option and whether there are some realworld experiences with something similar.p  pThank you very much Jakub Holyp  pPS Ive found the a hrefhttpwww.citytechinc.comcontentdamcitytechincpdfCITYTECHJBossEAPAmazonEC2CaseStudy.pdfJBoss EAP in a Cloud Case Studya that shows that it is possible to deploy a realworld Java EE application to the EC2 cloud but unfortunately therere no details regarding topology, instance types, or anything p

I am pretty much a noob and have zero experience around ORMs and MVC  so this an awesome learning curve I am on.p

Negative 4317 pI have worked on several projects with a lot of data tables. The tables had sorting, filtering and paging of course on server side and with help of the dbbr all databases has implemented sording, filtering where and limit the returned results.p  pWhen workig on real application there are a thousands of even a millions rows.p  pBut I have seen several JSF dagatable components.br They implement pagination, sorting and filtering on client side According to me this is very silly. This technology is called enterprise and they sort the data on the client side with java scriptp  pI have not seen any good JSF data grid that has build in features for sorting, filtering and lazy loading on the server side.  p  pWhy is that Am I looking in wrong direction or really there in no build support for this. Lately I am testing primefaces and lazy loading datatable. It really works fine, but the table i can only lazy load. If you add sort and filter then the problems begin. p  pConclusion Is there any datatable JSF component than can perform lazy load pagination, and filtering and sorting on server side. If I need to implement my own solution thanks to the teams that made client side sorting and filtering, they are useless.p  pRegardsp

Negative 4317 pMore of a general question here.p  pAt the moment a lot of the projects I work on utilize serverside views to render the user interface, and spruce it up with some JavaScript here and there. That is all fine and dandy for smaller projects, but lately it seems like the .js files are growing rather large in size, and the stacks upon stacks .live and .bind jQuery calls just dont seem to cut it anymore.p  pWhat are good ways to blend JavaScript into the view and, perhaps, the controller of a web application For the Javadriven websites I found a hrefhttpdirectwebremoting.org relnofollowDWRa  to be quite useful, but a lot of times user initiated events require controller logic, which is starting to become overwhelming and confusing when its part of the many lone functions included on the pages.p  pI considered a completely AJAXdriven template engine but that seems to be a bit extreme and will likely be a pain in the butt for anyone to use. Cloning the functionality of the existing backend classes, on the other hand, seems redundant.p  pWhat is a good middle ground approach used by web apps out there, those that arent entirely AJAX free nor completely JavaScript drivenp  pstrongEDITstrong Perhaps Ill provide an everyday example of a problem. Say Id like to provide the user with a modal dialogue confirming or denying something p  precodeYour picture is uploaded but looks terrible. You need a new do. OK  What codepre  pNow, in one scenario, that dialogue could pop up as a result of uploading an image with a page refresh, in which case the serverside view will render it. In another scenario, it might appear after uploading the image via AJAX, in which case itll probably be triggered by JavaScript on the page. In both cases we need to access the dialogue creation code, and I cant so far think up a way to have, say, a codeDialogcode class which would work the same in both cases.p

Negative 4317 pI have an MVC2 ntier application DAL, Domain, Service, MVC web using a DDD approach Domain Driven Design,  having a Domain Model with repositories. My service layer uses a emRequestResponse patternem, in which the Request and Response objects contain DTOs Data Transfer Objects to marshal data from one layer to the next, and the mapping is done via help from AutoMapper. My question is this strongwhat shape should a DTO typically takestrong Can it have strongnestedcomplexstrong DTOs as well or should it strictly be a strongflatstrong projection emOr possibly a mixture of bothem Also, what are the main reasons for having a flat DTO vs a more complexnested DTOp  pFor instance, suppose I had a domain such as the followingp  precodepublic class Employee      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      public Company Company  get set   public class Company      public string Name  get set      public string Address  get set      public string City  get set      public string State  get set   codepre  pThere are three different ways Ive thought of modeling the Response object.p  pstrongOption 1strong  the DRYest optionp  precodepublic class GetEmployeeResponse      public class EmployeeDTO  get set   contains a CompanyDTO property  codepre  pFrom the research Ive done, it would be inappropriate for a DTO to take a similar shape as the domain objects as demonstrated above.p  pstrongOption 2strong  a flattened projection of the domain antiDRYp  precodepublic class GetEmployeeResponse      public string FirstName  get set      public string LastName  get set      public string CompanyName  get set      public string CompanyAddress  get set      public string CompanyCity  get set      public string CompanyState  get set   codepre  pThis is more simple, like a DTO apparently should be, but ultimately makes for more DTOs.p  pstrongOption 3strong  a mixture of bothp  precodepublic class GetEmployeeResponse      public EmployeeDTO Employee  get set      public CompanyDTO Company  get set   codepre  pThis allows for the code to be a little bit more dry, reusable and manageable, and doesnt expose my domain structure to the end user. The other main benefit is that other responses, like codeGetCompanyResponsecode could simply return codeCompanyDTOcode, without having to make a copy of all those properties, similar to option 2. What do you think Which option of these if any have you taken andor have worked for you If these RequestResponses later get exposed as WCF service methods, does your answer changep

This gives it an advantage in flexibility but also a big disadvantage in space efficiency a emperrowem overhead for field names in the serialized data. Were trying to keep things in memory, and minimizing both memory and network footprint is important here. The more records we can fit in the same space, the faster our queries will be. We prefer relatively long, descriptive field names, and shortening them to make my database faster is wrongp  pIn the end, JSONBSON is unworkable for our purposes, unless we get more complex and map small keys to more descriptive keys in the application driver that talks to the database. Which got us thinking...p  pAlthough our database is schemaless, in reality 1 there arent too many different kinds of entities, 2 versions of the same kind of entity dont change often, and 3 when they do change, its usually just to add another field. JSONBSON have no native support for versioning.p  pProtocol Buffers and Thrift are much more sophisticated when it comes to versioning and data definition changes. Both Thrift and Protocol Buffers are great candidates for serializing data into databases, and Thrift is designed so that the encoding format is extensible.p  pProtocol Buffers look like a great choice for serializing data in a schemaless database.p  pCouchDB and MongoDB the two most popular schemaless databases use JSON and BSON respectively, but we cant find emanythingem about using something more advanced, like Protocol Buffers, as a serialization format for storing schemaless data. There are products that store a specific languages version of objects ie. storing Javas Externalizable objects in a datagrid, or doing NoSQL with MySQL in Ruby, but these are a pain try accessing them from other platforms, or even from MySQL itself, and forget about versioning.p  pIs anyone storing the more interoperable Protocol Buffers in their database, or some other advanced serialization format in their schemaless database This is a question of whether there are other options besides straightforward perrow serialization of JSONBSONXML, or serializing a specific languages objects.

Negative 4317 pI have a server socket that I have configured to allow one connection at once by blocking Accept calls with a semaphore, with a backlog queue size of 1. That is, I called .Listen1.p  pI then follow the following processp  ul liI call AcceptAsync on my server socket only onceli liI have a client ConnectAsync connects successfullyli liI have a client ConnectAsync connects successfully, supposedly in the queue... a way to tell would be niceli liI have a third client ConnectAsyncli ul  pThese three ConnectAsync calls happen in rapid succession.p  pThe expected result for the third ConnectAsync is to have the SocketAsyncEventArgs SocketError property be something other than SocketError.Success. I actually expect SocketError.ConnectionRefused, to be specific.p  pAbout 95 of the time, this is the case. The third clients callback gives me a SocketError value other than Success.p  pEvery now and then, though, the third ConnectAsync works, in the same way the second one does. The EventArgs.SocketError gives me SocketError.Success, and the corresponding Socket.Connected property reads true.p  pWhats going on I call AcceptAsync exactly strongoncestrong I have verified this carefully with breakpoints, so only one client should be accepted, and the rest should be on the backlog queue. My queue size is 1, so how is the third client connecting successfully every now and thenp  pPlease dont tell me to use a larger queue size. This is for a test function Ive written, and not code that is actively serving clients. At this point its more curiosity. p

Negative 4317 pI would appreciate some advice on an iphone game design. I want to display some backround image and other images on top of it buildings, characters etc. The backround is going to be large up to 10 times the size of the screen so only a piece of the background file will be displayed at once. The idea is to replace this piece when character gets close to screen borders. I need to make this background transition as a smooth animation. Also, I need to have a zoom inout feature, preferably animated. Some images on the screen will be static buildings and some will require some animation character walking.p  pWhat is the best designp  ol liUse strongCore Graphicsstrong combined with sprite classes  displaying sprites UIImage with CGContextDrawImage li liUse strongUIKitstrong      create UIImageview to hold every     image and add them as subviews in a     single view appplicationli liUse strongOpenGLstrong     ES projectli ol  pstrongOption 1strong turned out to be very slow. It seems like CoreGraphics is not meant to display images in a game loop. But maybe there is a way to make it effecient Maybe combine it with Core Animation somehowp  pstrongOption 2strong is my current choice. I am hoping the view to cache the image it holds and thus be more effecient than CG. But will the animation provided by UIImageview will be satisfactory I think the views shouldnt be added all at once, but rather created amp added removed dynamically when background moves. Is it a good ideap  pstrongOption 3strong would probably give the best control over the images but it seems like quite an overhead. I only need to display images, not vector graphics.

I have used C extensively so using the features of C is not a problem.p  pThe protocol stack has three layers and it is already fully specified and formally verified.

Should also mention that protocol is very simple but can run on different devices over a reliable physical transport layer. I know the events, inputs, outputs, side effects and the behaviour of the protocol state machines. Generally, an interrupt is received to read the message received from the physical layer to read it and send to the waiting device. The receiving device can process and pass the response message to the protocol layer to send out on the physical layer.p  pAny help with referencesrecommendations will be appreciated. I am willing to use a different language if only to help me understand how to implement them but I will have to eventually resort to the language of choice.p  pstrongUpdatestrong An example protocol I wish to implement is something like a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu882753NFC20Simple20NDEF20Exchange20Protocol20Specification201.0.pdfSNEPa.p  pI do not need to worry about connection management.

Negative 4317 pApparently there seems to be a text length limit on the TextView element when used within a ListView. I have to admit I have not checked the actual limit that I am facing, but it is clear to me that 2k characters is no biggie, where 4k characters is simply not being displayed. And not displayed is not even right, as the screen seems to be scrollable for the full length of the TextView although all I get to see is whitespace.p  pMy issue I am displaying a ListView for an email message. All parts of the mail are in seperate TextView elements that get dropped into the ListView. When a lengthy message somewhere above 2k characters is put into a TextView, the TextView remains empty but does occupy space.p  pMy question What alternativesoptions are there to make this problem go away Eg Making the entire message displayable even long ones.p  pThanks to anyone in advance for assistance.p

Negative 4317 pThis is it, for all the marbles, if I can get this issue solved then I have a project completed.p  pAnyway, I am using Ruby on Rails 3 with Devise for user authentication. As you may know, in the user adminedit by default, a user has to enter their current password in the currentpassword field if they provide a new password. There is a TON of information out there on how to disable currentpassword so users can change and save freely.p  pHowever, I can find very little on doing the opposite requiring the current password for more fields...in my case, the email field. AND only require the current password when that email addy is changed, not if it remains the same. Currently users can freely change their email without giving their current password, and for security reasons, I dont want this.p  pAfter looking through the Devise wiki, I did find a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowToAllowuserstoedittheiraccountwithoutprovidingapasswordthis pagea and I thought I could reverse this code to complete this solution. I managed to work this little bit out in my user.rb model I stripped out of the unnecessary logic for this post....p  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase    Include default devise modules. Others available are    tokenauthenticatable, confirmable, lockable and timeoutable   devise databaseauthenticatable, registerable, confirmable,          recoverable, rememberable, trackable, validatable     Setup accessible or protected attributes for your model   attraccessible name, email, password, passwordconfirmation, avatar, rememberme, agree   attraccessor accessible, agree, signedin   attrreadonly name     Validation   validates name, presence gt TRUE, uniqueness gt TRUE, length gt  within gt 4..20    validates agree, termagreement gt TRUE, unless gt signedin   validatesattachmentsize avatar, lessthan gt 1.megabyte   validatesattachmentcontenttype avatar, contenttype gt [imagejpeg, imagepng, imagegif]   validates currentpassword, presence gt TRUE, if gt passwordrequired    protected    def passwordrequired     emailchanged   end  end codepre  pIt almost works. If I save the user profile with changing nothing, or change other nonpassword required field like the user avatar, the profile saves fine, no password required. So far, so good.p  pAnd if I change the email address, the validation emisem triggered....but what happens is that both the currentpassword AND password for new password fields trigger as required. And if I fill in the password in all three password, passwordconfirmation, currentpassword just for the hell of it, it wont take, just gives a validation error again.p  pBasically, ONLY the currentpassword should be required if the email address is changed. How would I make this work in my codep  ul liUPDATE strongememstrongli ul  pI checked out my log in response to the below suggestion by bowsersenior, and see the following lines when I attempt to save and update the email...p  precodeUser Load 0.2ms  SELECT users.id FROM users WHERE LOWERusers.email  LOWERnewaddresschanged.com AND users.id ltgt 1 LIMIT 1   User Load 0.2ms  SELECT users.id FROM users WHERE users.name  BINARY Administrator AND users.id ltgt 1 LIMIT 1   SQL 0.1ms  ROLLBACK codepre  pI wonder if that ROLLBACK has something to do with the final issuep

Negative 4317 pI am writing a small JavaScript library, and in it, I have components that need to receive messages when certain page events go off, and allow users to supply response functions. Basically, I need to access the general events, such as codeonkeydowncode, and the user can supply how a component will handle it.p  pSetting a callback like this is easy.

Negative 4317 pI have a project Im working on. I recently switched it to release mode with full optimization just to get an idea how some things will perform out of debug mode. On doing so however, I noticed that there were a few irregularities. In my particular case, I have a sprite whos alpha value is different more transparent in release mode then debug mode. p  pTo check my findings, I made a copy of the release mode build options, but turned off optimizations being sure that DEBUG and other related preprocessor options were removed and it performed correctly. Something in the optimization process modifies the behaviour of my system. Its probably because there are variables Im not initializing in my classes somewhere.p  pMy question is, is there an alternative, aside from manually combing over my code, to making sure things are initialized properly Ive checked the warnings that pop up, but all are related to int to floatfloat to int conversion and possible loss of data and enum qualifiers, and none of them are related to the alpha on my sprite.p  pIm using Visual Studio 2010 if it makes a difference.p

Negative 4317 pIm using rails 2 for this app, with ActionMailer, but this is a general question about emails.  p  pWhen we send out emails, i save a record corresponding to the email in a database table.  Id like to keep track of whether people have read the emails, and am wondering the best way to do it.  On initial googling, it seems like ive stumbled into an ongoing battle between spammers and email clientsp  pMy first thought was to use the read receipt header, but i know that this isnt supported by a lot of clients and is therefore unreliable.  After that, i read of the tactic of including an image in the mail, and of detecting that image being loaded.  I was thinking that i could put a parameter with the email records id in the image url, so that when i get a request for that image i can see if it has a for example emailid param and if so, mark the corresponding email as having been read.p  pBut, then i remembered that many clients are wise to this tactic and specifically ask the viewer of the mail if they want to display images.  Obviously they might say no.p  pAm i right in thinking that i cant pull in other resources, such as stylesheets, in my mail  Because if i emcanem pull them in, i could do that same trick but with the stylesheet rather than an image.p  pGrateful for any advice, max p

Thats probably my fault, since I didnt fully explain. This is being requested as a tackedon feature to a monitoring product, and is designed to offer emminimalem security monitoring. As part of our dialog with the client and our documentation, were emphasising that this is not a catchall, nor is it a replacement for proper security infrastructure e.g. an IDS and firewall. Its simply an informational service to help provide basic threat detection and produce statistics about the number of potential attacks. Im not trying to write an IDS or firewall. If it were up to me, Id leave the feature out and tell them to go install a full suite of security infrastructure with its own monitoring systems, but this isnt my call. The current situation is that Ive been testing the system on my own site. Right now, Im just looking for a way to improve the regex strings to make this more effective. Hopefully this clears things up a little.p

Negative 4317 pI am looking at a class in a solution that implements the codeISerializablecode interface. It has a codeGetObjectDatacode method for serialization as required by the interface. There is not any custom serialization happening here, it is simply populating the codeSerializationInfocode object with the names of the properties of the class and their values. p  precode[Serializable] public class PersonName ISerializable      [DataMember]     public string NamePrefix  get set      [DataMember]     public string GivenName  get set      [DataMember]     public string SurName  get set       public PersonNamestring givenName, string surName, string namePrefix              GivenName  givenName         SurName  surName         NamePrefix  namePrefix           public PersonName                region ISerializable Members      public void GetObjectDataSerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context              info.AddValueNamePrefix,NamePrefix         info.AddValueGivenName,GivenName         info.AddValueSurName,SurName       codepre  pFrom the documentation Ive read so far, as I understand it, this is what would happen anyway by the class being marked with the code[Serializable]code attribute, and as you can see the class does not have a deserialization constructor, which is why Im looking at it to begin with. From what I can tell, rather than needing to add the deserialization constructor to the class, the class really doesnt need to implement the codeISerializablecode interface in the first place. Is that correctp

Negative 4317 pI have a transparent web view which is a large rectangle. The webpage it loads has smaller rectangles that dont fill the whole web view. So in those spaces not occupied by divs, you can see through the web view to whatever window or app is behind. Although you can see through, you cant click through.  I need to be able to click through the web view in parts of it that dont have active content. Any ideasp  pOne of my ideas was have a transparent nsview on top of the web view, intercepting mouse downs , getting the coordinate, then referencing that coordinate in the web view and seeing if there is active content there, and if so, passing the mouse down event to the web view, but if not, ignoring itpassing it behind. This makes sense to me, but i dont know how I would accomplish this...p

But comments would not really be part of an AST right So what would be a good way of finding the representation of a structure that follows a specific comment annotationp  pIm not too worried about handling cases where the annotation would appear in an inappropriate place as it will only be used to parse C files that are specifically written for this application. But of course the more robust I can make it, the better.p

Negative 4317 pIm trying to find or convert sound files to use in my Android game that will play on both the emulator which is rather easy to do as well as a physical device which appears to be harder to do.p  pMy original sound effect was a .Wav file, 16 bit stereo and played just fine on both the emulator and testing device, but was 120Kb which multiplied my file size by five, and I need two more sound effects and wasnt an appropriate sound for the game.p  pAny attempts make the file smaller changing it to mono, using 8 bits instead of 16, converting it to an MP3, etc. caused the sound to fail to be played on the physical device.p  pIs there any way to determine what problems the decoder has trying to read the sound files The log files dont give any error messages during load times, and only says sample emxem is not READY when I try to play it.p  pAlso, Im using Android 1.5 and cant upgrade my physical device to a later version, so its hard limit right now.p

Negative 4317 pIm a little bit confused by the codecontentSizecode property in codeUIScrollViewcode. I have an image in my scrollView that Im zooming and panning.

My tweaks use various regex patterns and regex replace in order to perform the modifications I need.p  pIm a bit stuck with the complicated table syntax, though.

It should contain at least one content line in order to match. The header and alignment data also has to obey certain rules as seen on the examples.p  pHow would you approach building a regex such as this Better yet, can someone provide me some starting point where to build upon Its possible my approach is misguided perhaps regex can be avoided. If so, any ideas leading to the same results easier are appreciated.p

However, subsequent additions and subtractions of the squirrel cause the little critter to scurry down the map. Hmmm... p  pWhat I want is for the squirrel to stay in the same place, just under the Google basemap controls, each and every time I click the Squirrel button.

Negative 4317 pI really need help. I am making a game app for my final year project. It is a simple game where you have to shoot a ball into a target by rebounding of walls or angled blocks. However i need help in 2 areasp  ol lipthe shooting mechanism is similar to that of stupid zombies. There is a crosshairs where you touch on the screen to indicate which direction you want the ball to be shot at. On release the ball should move into that direction and hopefully gets into the target and if not gravity and friction causes it to come to a stop. p  pThe problem is how do I code something like thispli lipI need the ball to rebound of the walls and I will have some blocks angled so that the ball has to hit a certain part to get to the target. The ball will eventually come to a stop if the target is not reached.p  pHow can I make a method to create the collisions of the wall and blockspli ol  pI have spent the last weeks trying to find tutorials to help me make the game but have not found much specific to the type of game I am making. It would be great if sample code or template could be provided as this is my first android app and it is for my final year project and i do not have much time left.p  pThank you in advancebr akkkip

Negative 4317 pI am new to iOS development, so I would appreciate some feedback.p  pI am trying to build an iOS client for my web service. So far this is what I have donep  pI am implementing two views Utilitybased app using Storyboard. In the main view, I use a text field and a search button, where the user can enter a query and then click the search button. Once the search button is clicked, my intention is to read the value of the text field, and use it in my Restful call to my web service. My web service replies back with a JSON file with the query results, which I parse and show to the secondary views text area.p  pI know how to do the restful call in iOS and how to do the JSON parsing as well as displaying the results on the screen at least the text stuff, but thats another different question. But my intention is to learn and implement MVC basics to my application.p  pAccording to MVC, the controller updates the view, and the model sends out a notification broadcast which the controller can listen to and know if there are any changes in the object. So this is what I would ideally like to dop  pMy Model  My model would handle the core RESTful call, get the JSON reply, parse it and get the resulting values that I want to display on the view.p  pMy Controller  I would like my controller to listen to my model and obtain the resulting values from Model and display them on View.p  pUsing a quick and dirty way, I can implement the RESTful call, JSON parsing and displaying resulting values  all inside the Controller, but with this technique, if my view changes tomorrow, then I have to rewrite my code. Or if I want to add new features, then I have to change my controller. So ideally I would like to have a core Model thats not aware of how View looks like, and just lets the Controller take the results from Model and display them on View.p  pFrom what I have read from Google search results so far, two ways of doing this is by a Key Value Observation and b Notification center.p  pFor last 2 days, I am trying to find a good decent way to implement Notification center or read more about it, I am not getting a good lead. Some of the questions I have is, can I send out the String results value using Notification center that my controller picks up How does Notification Center really work with string values Where can I find some good examplesp  pSo any help regarding this will be very much appreciated.p

The plugin was originally designed to run integration tests, but it would be possible to use it to extend e.g. the compilation phase. But it requires the child pom.xmls to be treated as resources and modified on the fly. For the problem that I described here the solution would be too complicated and unstable. I would prefer something lighter that could operate in memory while building maven model.p  pSo for now I use profiles, trying to make them as compact as possible. Probably in a while I will need again to think about the problem.p
Negative 4317 pI am building a small business which revolves around a complex form. So far, Ive been developing the form in Javascript. However, the fact that js is client side pretty much means all my efforts are exposed to possible theft. Ive looked into obfuscation techniques, but due to the fact that there are deobfuscators out there, securing the intellectual property is dicey at best.p  pIs there any way to secure my js code from theft Is copyrighting or trademarking the code a feasible alternative This project is pretty much of a niche, so if a competitor who used similar code suddenly appeared, it wouldnt be all that difficult to check. However, if someone else used my code as the basis for a server side app, then Id be pretty much screwed. If js is not a viable language to develop in, is there a server side language which could do the job What pitfalls await the project on the server sidep  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Negative 4317 pstrongCliffs Is there a known pattern for passing a standard filter type to a stored procedure to encapsulate stardateenddatepagesizepagenum parametersstrongp  pNot sure the correct place for this question. Im exploring the idea of passing a filtering object parameter to a stored procedure which encapsulates our common filtering parameters startdate, enddate, pagenumber, pagesize, list of ints, etc. The reason for this is to reduce the amount of similar parameters and boilerplate SQL spread around our procedures. This would give us a more standard interface and starting point for each procedure right from the start. I havent been able to find much info on the topic.p  pPattern Ive noticed  when first building most SPs they start with a single id parameter used in the where clause. At some point later, you may need to add parameters for date range parameters startdate, enddate or dynamic ranges ytd, mtd, dtd. If the data set is large enough you also may need to introduce pagesizepagenum for server side paging. After some time you may realize that you need results for a list of ids rather than a single id, so you add a CSV or XML parameter to envelope the IDs.p  pUltimately many stored procedures end up with a lot of similar boilerplate and hopefully identical parameters for handling these standard filtering parameters. Im trying to research known patterns for passing an encapsulated filter object parameter to my procedures, that ideally would be strongly typed on the C side. This would be particularly useful when managing a group of procedures that power reports which all require the same filtering options in addition to the reportspecific query parameters.p  pMy goal is to reduce the number of parameters required to the bare minimum needed for the WHERE clause, and create a standard mechanism for passing the generic filtering options into a procedure and using those values while inside a procedure. How could this be achieved through XML or CLR or UDT parameters p  pFor context of this question, Im using SQL Server 2008 via ADO.Net from C 2.0. Unfortunately LINQEF is not an option for this project at this point, and we must stick with our existing RDBMS. If there is a known pattern that requires changing technologies I would be interested in hearing about it. p  pstrongEditstrong Appreciate the replies so far. Ive added a bounty for 50pts that Ill let run for a few more days to try to promote some more discussion. If my question isnt clear enough just leave a comment.. p

It causes access violation exceptions to occur.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs it right to sometimes declare COMinterface in .h fileli liIf yes is it right to specify C types as parameters for COM interface methods Or should I always use COM compliant types in such cases BSTR etcli ol

Negative 4317 pIm a novice MySQL user so could really use a little advice here. Ive inherited a program that currently processes text files consisting of approximately 100,000 records each. Each line is its own record and gets processed. A file like this can be completed in about a minute as nothing to intense is being done, mostly just string comparisons.p  pAnyway, now some SQL queries have to be added to the process without slowing things down too much. Essentially, its possible that each of those 100,000 lines will now need to make a SQL select statement to query a DB and see if more data is accessible. I threw together a rough start and it takes the processing time from a minute to about an hour. Definitely unacceptable. My question is, is there even way to speed this up Im sure there isp  pIm only opening one connection object but I dont see any way around making that individual SQL query for each record. Is there a way to batch select statements Any advice would be very helpful, thank you.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSorry, I should have been more explicit. This is for SQL select statements. I know how to do batch Inserts, thats no problem. I dont understand if batch select statements are possible or how to speed them up.p  pAlso, someone mentioned Indexes, but I dont know anything about indexes. Could someone provide me some info on themp

So the key has to be long int id1, long int id2p  pSo I decided that I need a hashMap inside a hashMap for this to work.p  pThis is the structure of my distance storing hash mapp  precode    googledensehashmapltlong int, googledensehashmapltlong int, doublegt gt distanceHash codepre  pThis is the code to insert a distance into the hash map and retrieve itp  precodetemplateltclass Pointgt void CoverTreeltPointgt insertDistancelong int id1, long int id2, long double distance     Always id1 lt id2   ifid1 lt id2        long temp  id1     id1  id2     id2  temp        ifdistanceHash.findid1  distanceHash.end        googledensehashmapltlong int, doublegt insideHash     insideHash.setemptykey9999       insideHash[id2]  distance     distanceHash[id1]  insideHash      else        distanceHash[id1][id2]  distanceHash[id1][id2]      templateltclass Pointgt double CoverTreeltPointgtgetStoredDistancelong int id1, long int id2    ifid1 lt id2        long temp  id1     id1  id2     id2  temp       googledensehashmapltlong int, doublegtiterator it    ifdistanceHash.findid1  distanceHash.end         if distanceHash[id1].findid2  distanceHash[id1].end         return distanceHash[id1][id2]       return 1  codepre  pI have millions of distances.  LasTime I checked ,there were roughly 600000000 distances of which 400000000 were unique.  This means that 13rd of the distances are repeated and that time can be saved.  p  pBut when I use this hash map structure to store the distances, the program runs way slower.  This is what I exactly find If I just store the distances using the distance function, then the whole program runs about 50 seconds slower. 200 secs with storage and 150 without. But If I store the distances and then use the hashmap to check whether the distances exist before computing them, the program becomes way way slower125th of the program takes 300 seconds.p  pI dont understand this behaviour.  I would guess that once the distances are stored, it should be faster to retrieve the distances.  Please let me know what is wrong here and if it can be made faster.p  pP.S RAM is not an issue.  I am running this on a server with around 160 gigs of RAM. And the peak memory consumption when the hashmap is used is only 1.8 of the total memorysaw that using top.  So paging and thrashing should not be an issue.p
Negative 4317 pIm trying to make a solution in Visual Studio that consists of a VC DLL  CCLI and a VB.Net application.

Negative 4317 pI was a little confused to find today that the following does not work when trying to change the text shown on a codeUIButtoncode.p  precode 001 [[[self button] titleLabel] setTextPeanuts] codepre  pI think I know why, but I just wanted to confirm my thinking here. 001 does set the titleLabel text property, but as its a codeUILabelcode a subview of the codeUIButtoncode it does not cause the UI to be redrawn. This results in an internal change to the codeUILabelcode text property, but sadly no visual change in the UI.p  precode 002 [[self button]setTitlePeanuts forStateUIControlStateNormal] codepre  pIt would seem that the method setTitleforState is the correct way to go, it has the extra overhead of requiring a state but does invoke a UI redraw because its being called directly on the codeUIButtoncode. My question is, is 002 the correct way to do this, it would seem it is unless I am doing something totally wrongp

Negative 4317 pI inherited some crazy code from someone whos long gone.  He implemented a single custom control to implement a large passel of loosely related queries.  p  pThe control has a bunch of different panels, all set to Visiblefalse to reflect the different set of filter inputs.  Then theres a single GridView for the results.  The GridView has codeltaspTemplateFields Visiblefalsegtcode for the superset of all possible columns returned from all the different queries he wanted to run.p  pThe codebehind for the control runs around at init flipping Visibletrue for the filter panel and the columns of the particular query wanted at the moment.p  pTo compound the craziness, I just noticed that having codeltaspTemplateField Visiblefalsegtcode doesnt stop the ltItemTemplate inside from getting built, so his control is doing all kinds of extra work that will never get seen.p  pTo give one examplep  precode ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextExpiration Date SortExpressionExpirationDate Visiblefalsegtltbr gt       ltitemtemplategtltbr gt           ltaspHyperLink runatserver IDFormLink Targetblank NavigateURLlt CreateFormLink gt Textlt DateUtil.getFormattedDateEvalExpireDate gt gtltbr gt                           ltaspHyperLinkgtltbr gt       ltitemtemplategtltbr gt  ltaspTemplateFieldgtltbr gt codepre  pThe codebehind method codeCreateFormLinkcode gets called even though Visible is false...p  pThe only reason it hadnt blown up before was that the method uses StringBuilder to cobble together the href, and codeStringBuilder.AppendEvalfoocode doesnt blow up.p  pI tried to replace the StringBuilder use with concatenations to be more memory efficient and got a boom when the column wasnt in the current result set.p  pSince codeVisiblefalsecode isnt stopping the work from being done even though it stops the display, is there a more canonical way to do this  Or should I just start overp

Suppose you have a mini browser on a phone... and it has a vertical scroll bar... and a horizontal one. What I emwantem to do is be able to scroll down... and WHILE i am scrolling down also scroll the horizontal one so i can move the page left or right.  So a few seconds after I touch the screen and begin moving the vertical scrollbar downwards or upwards... i want to use a different finger and touch the horizontal scrollbar and move it as well at the same time.p  pIs this even possible Are there certain hardware or software limitations preventing something like thisp

Negative 4317 pRecently I did some web design work for a person. I continued to show him progress by giving him a link to his new site on my development server. Nearing the end of completion, he dropped all contact with me and I was completely unable to get a hold of him. I took a look at his site recently, and he mixed a combination of his old site, with the new one I was creating. I thought maybe he redesigned it himself after looking at my version, however a quick look at his source code shows that the parts I recognized were full out just copied by viewing the source code on my dev server. So he completely stiffed me and I received no payment from him.p  pJust wondering if theres anyway to prevent that in the futurep  pMy first thought was obfuscation, but a quick search shows that doing that to html is not recommended and not foolproof anyway.p  pObviously this is a lesson learned for me to get some sort of up front payment first, but being able to prevent work from being so easily stolen in the future would be nice.p  pAre there any developers that have come across similar issues How do you show someone the progress of your work without giving them plain as day access to your sourcep

Negative 4317 pI have an element whos overflow is hidden until a function is called. I am trying to determine if the mouse is hovering over this overflow material emafterem I set codeoverflow visiblecode, but instead, it tells me that my mouse is hovering on the overflow content even when its still invisible.p  pIs there a way to check visible height in jQuery Here is what I was tryingp  precode    off  curSub.offset     xSubStart  parseIntoff.left     ySubStart  parseIntoff.top     xSubEnd  xSubStart  parseIntcurSub.width     ySubEnd  ySubStart  parseIntcurSub.height      if  x gt xStart ampamp x lt xEnd ampamp y gt yStart ampamp y lt yEnd           x gt xSubStart ampamp x lt xSubEnd ampamp y gt ySubStart ampamp y lt ySubEnd            display menu         cur.cssoverflow, visible         match  true      codepre  pThe codexStart, xEnd, yStartcode, and codeyEndcode variables are defined above that code and work just fine. I believe the problem is that the jQuery function codewidth, height, outerWidthcode, and codeouterHeightcode dont test to see if the element is visible.p  pIs there anyway to achieve this I thought about just moving it from hidden to visible physically with codetopcode and codeleftcode specifications, but I think this way would be cleaner if its possible.p  pHope someone knows the answer.p

Negative 4317 pIm working on an autonomous rover that navigates partially by ultrasound proximity sensors. Before we implement the hardware we want to do some testing of our algorithms with a simulator, which I am now writing.p  pOne task that Im having some trouble with is that the ultrasound sensor has a 60 degree field of view. If an object is detected, any point along that 60 degree arc at that radius emmayem have an object, but all points below that radius are emguaranteedem not to have an object.p  pWhat I need to do is write a function that is given an x,y coordinate and a bearing Im restricting this to the 4 cardinals for now and have it return to me a list of pixels within a radius and a list of pixels at that radius. With repeated scans from multiple locations and bearings all objects can be found.p  pMy initial thought was to work iteratively. Start at the row in front of the sensor and sweep back and forth in progressively wider scans 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,etc. However eventually the radii stop aligning with the rows. My new search path would be to figure out how to draw an arc with pixels, then step the radius up to the first collision.p  pThis question asks a similar question, but is only interested in specific points so I believe it is a fundamentally different problem.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10868501howtocalculateallpointslongitudelatitudewithinagivenradiusfromgivenhow to calculate all pointslongitude,latitude within a given radius from given point longitude,latitudeap

Negative 4317 pIm in the very early stages of attempting to automate data entry and collection from a website. I have a 16,000 line CSV file. For each line, Id like to enter data from that line into a codetextareacode on a webpage. The webpage can then perform some calculations with that data and spit out an answer that Id collect. Specifically, on the webpage a hrefhttpwww.mirbase.orgsearch.shtml relnofollowhttpwww.mirbase.orgsearch.shtmla, Id like to enter a sequence in the sequence text box at the bottom, press the Search miRNAs button and then collect results on the next page. p  pMy plan as of right now is to use a C codeWebBrowsercode. My understanding is that I can access the individual elements in the codeHtmlDocumentcode either by codeidcode, codenamecode or coordinate. The last option is not ideal, because if I distribute this program to other people I cant be sure theyd be using at the same coordinates. As for the other 2 options, the codetextareacode has a codenamecode, but its the same as the form name, so I dont know how to access it. The button Id like to click has neither a codenamecode nor an codeidcode. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to how to access the elements I need I am by no means set on this method, so if theres an easierbetter way Im certainly open to suggestions.p

Negative 4317 pI have a crawlerbot which downloads various pages in parallel using parallel.for and parallel.foreach. The MaxDegreeOfParallelism is set to around 20 since increasing it does not seem to improve the performance further and I do not want to overload any web servers.p  pWhen I start the crawling from an ASP.NET website of all places, it is running with acceptable performance and it all takes a few hours. Due to the design issues with this setup, I am changing this so I can start it from the console instead.p  pAll the code I need is in a dll that can be accessed by both the website and the console app.p  pThere is no output to the console except for a startup message.p  pThe problem is that when I run this from the console or from the debugger, it takes about 10 times longer than when I run it from the ASP.NET website. I would have found it easier to understand if the ASP.NET version would be slower than the console.p  pWhy is this so or how can I debug this or find out why it is so or fix the problemp  pbEdit b This also happens in when trying both variants through the visual studio debugger. The output to the Output window from Debug is similar top  pThe thread  0x1d34 has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread  0xf20 has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread  0x3414 has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread  0x35c8 has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread  0xdc has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread  0x1c98 has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread  0x3308 has exited with code 0 0x0.

The thread  0x376c has exited with code 0 0x0.p  pexcept that in the ASP.NET case this text is written about 10 times faster.p  pPerhaps it could also be worth mentioning that the dll invokes 7zip via COM for each downloaded page to compress it.p
Negative 4317 pAfter 5 long day trying to set up sending email from php script, I finaly did it from my local server, i use apache. p  pFrom the host, i cant do it.  I get this errorp  pSMTP Error Could not connect to SMTP hostp  pSo, Ive searched around stack overflow, among others. I tried using SMTPSecure  ssl, did nothing. I checked is extensionphpopenssl.dll commented out, but it doesnt even exist on my host. I mean, there is no file in php.ini named phpopenssl.dll. There is only information that Openssl is installed under Curl section and what version is it. Under openssl section says that it is enabled. The same configuration is on my computer and on the host but mails wont be sent on host.p  pThank you in advance for your answers.p
Negative 4317 pDo Google App Engine backends always end with a HardDeadLineExceeded after about a day of processingp  pAfter my backend B8 process runs for about a day and a half, it is invariably shutdown with a HardDeadLineExceeded exception.  On the dev server, it takes about two days to finish the same queued task.  I thought backends could possibly run indefinitely, though not guaranteed, according to a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspythonbackendsoverviewShutdownGoogle relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspythonbackendsoverviewShutdownGooglea .  But, what Im seeing is almost assuredly that the backend will be terminated within a day or so, which seems like more of a policy than happenstance due to  The machine running the backend is restarted, forcing your backend to move to a different machine. or App Engine needs to move your backend to a different machine to improve load distribution.p  pMy task is to parse through huge XML files with Stax, and write out a set of CSV files from the results, to the blobstore.p  pNow that the premier feature of Always On is gone, it seems there is no other option than to handle the shutdown request, but this would involve saving the StAX XML Parser cursor state which may not be possible and writing out the outputted file frequently back to the blobstore.  So ... backends arent really good at being backends, imo.  p
Negative 4317 pI am new to web development and am making an app that basically displays a listbox of documents. When the user clicks a document, that document pdf is displayed in an iFrame.

If I turn auto postback for the lsitbox off, the SelectedIndexchange event never fires. p

Negative 4317 pI am new here. I am a beginner in Qt but i am an intermediate level programmer in c. I had written a program previously in C and STLNo code is platform dependent and whole program is broken into around ten .cpp.h files. Now if I develop A Gui in qt,can I link it to my old program or should I rewrite everything For instance I use file IO using fstream. But in Qt I see there is QFile so is it possible to link it. The program is pretty lengthy. So it will be very hard to rewrite everything. Gui is not mandatory for me but I thought it would be good for presentation.It is for my Project so please reply soon.Please give me some examples or sites to refer to if possible. Thank you in Advance... Manishp

Ive worked around it by changing the date parameter to a string parameter but thats not ideal.p  pEverything else with the MySQL 5.6.10 server appears to be running fine, Im still trying to determine if there were changes made between 5.0 and 5.6 in regard to how ODBC is handled but so far Ive had no luck in figuring out just why this is acting so odd.p  pHeres a portion of the query with the relevant parameters...p  precode    select sqlnocache     ifCCT.creditCardTypeName is not null, CCT.creditCardTypeName, ifOPBML.orderPaymentBMLID is not null, Bill Me Later, CashCheck as theType,     orderPayment                as source,     dateformatOP.authorizationDate, Ymd as theDate,     if OPC.checkNumber is not null, OPC.checkNumber,  as checkNum,     if OPWT.wireTransferDate is not null, OPWT.wireTransferNumber,  as wtNum,     concatC.lastName, , , C.firstName as custName,     O.orderNumber,     OP.amount from     orders O     inner join orderPayment OP on O.ordersIDOP.ordersID     inner join paymentMethod PM on PM.paymentMethodIDOP.paymentMethodID     inner join customer C on C.customerIDO.customerID     inner join partner P on C.partnerID  P.partnerID and P.businessUnit  businessUnit     left outer join orderPaymentBML OPBML on OP.orderPaymentIDOPBML.orderPaymentID     left outer join orderPaymentCheck OPC on OP.orderPaymentIDOPC.orderPaymentID     left outer join orderPaymentCreditCard OPCC on OP.orderPaymentIDOPCC.orderPaymentID     left outer join orderPaymentWireTransfer OPWT on OP.orderPaymentIDOPWT.orderPaymentID     left outer join creditCardType CCT on CCT.creditCardTypeIDOPCC.creditCardTypeID where     OP.authorizationDate between dateadddate,INTERVAL 3001 HOURSECOND and      dateadd dateadddate, INTERVAL 1 DAY, INTERVAL 3000 HOURSECOND and     PM.paymentMethodAbbreviation in BM, CC, CH, WT codepre  pThanks, SJp

I want horizontal layout lines in a horizontallyscrolling collection view.p  pI also dont have any inherent sections in my model  this is just a single set of items. I could group them into sections, but the collection view is resizable, so the number of items that can fit on a page would change sometimes, and it seems like the choice of which page each item goes on is better left to the layout than to the model if I dont have any meaningful sections.p  pSo, can I do this with Flow Layout, or do I need to create a custom layoutp

Negative 4317 pI have been fighting against a function giving me a memory error and thanks to your support a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17097483pythonhowtosplitandreturnalistfromafunctiontoavoidmemoryerrorPython how to split and return a list from a function to avoid memory errora I managed to sort the issue however, since I am not a proprogrammer I would like to ask for your opinion on my method and how to improve its performance if possible.p  pThe function is a generator function returning all cycles from an nnodes digraph. However, for a 12 nodes digraph, there are about 115 million cycles each defined as a list of nodes, e.g. [0,1,2,0] is a cycle. I need all cycles available for further processing even after I have extracted some of their properties when they were first generated, so they need to be stored somewhere. So, the idea is to cut the result array every 10 million cycles to avoid memory error when an array is too big, python runs out of RAM and create a new array to store the following results. In the 12 node digraph, I would then have 12 result arrays, 11 full ones containing 10 million cycles each and the last containing 5 million cycles.p  pHowever, splitting the result array is not enough since the variables stay in RAM. So, I still need to write each one to the disk and delete it afterwards to clear the RAM.p  pAs stated in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1373164howdoidovariablevariablesinpythonHow do I do variable variables in Pythona, using exec to create variable variable names is not very clean and dictionary solutions are better. However, in my case, if I store the results in a single dictionary, it will run out of memory due to the size of the arrays. Hence, I went for the exec way. I would be grateful if you could comment on that decision.p  pAlso, to store the arrays I use numpy.savezcompressed which gives me a 43 Mb file for each 10million cycles array. If it is not compressed it creates a 500 Mb file. However, using the compressed version slows the writing process.

Negative 4317 pIn our sitecore 6.6.0 rev. 130404 based project, we are required to migrate data from the old systems database to the sitecore database. We need to migrate around 650,000 objects. Each of these objects from the old database will create around 4 sitecore items in the master database. So its a fairly large set of data being migrated.p  pWeve hooked up sitecore APIs with a windows application and we run the data migration logic from that app. At the begining of the data migration, things are fairly fast, around 4 objects per second are transferred to sitecore master database. The first 10,000 objects only took 40 minutes. At this rate, one would predict that in 7 hours, 100,000 objects will be migrated.p  pBut the problem is over time, things get increasingly and noticeably slow. After having around 100,000 objects migrated, now it takes around 7 hours to migrate just 30,000 objects. I even rebuilt sitecore database indexes time to time as mentioned in the performance tuning guide. We also dont perform any sitecore queries to find where to place the newly created sitecore items. No sitecore agents or lucene index update operations are running when our data migration is happening.p  pHeres the code at the beginning of the data migration logicp  precodeusing new Sitecore.SecurityModel.SecurityDisabler using new Sitecore.Data.Proxies.ProxyDisabler using new Sitecore.Data.DatabaseCacheDisabler using new Sitecore.Data.BulkUpdateContext codepre  pCould the reason for this slowness be the growth of sitecore database indexes.

I want them to line up centered next to the select boxes, but they align at the top of it and nothing I have tried thus far has worked.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3NXXA.png altenter image description herep  precode                ltfieldset stylewidth62 floatleft marginleft 19gt                          ltlabel stylewidth float leftgtTypeltlabelgt                         ltselect stylewidth40 float leftgt                             ltoptiongtMotherboardltoptiongt                             ltoptiongtMemoryltoptiongt                             ltoptiongtProcessorltoptiongt                         ltselectgt                          ltlabel stylewidthauto float leftgtItemltlabelgt                         ltselect stylewidth40 float leftgt                             ltoptiongtMotherboardltoptiongt                             ltoptiongtMemoryltoptiongt                             ltoptiongtProcessorltoptiongt                         ltselectgt                          lta hrefgtltimg srcimagesicntrash.png stylewidthauto float leftgtltagt                         lta hrefgtltimg srcimagesicnnewarticle.png stylewidthauto float leftgtltagt                  ltfieldsetgtltdiv classcleargtltdivgt codepre  pemUpdateemp  pWhen changing it to use a Table instead, it appears as the following...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYPo18.png altenter image description herep  precode                    ltdiv idinv1 classinventory stylemargin0 padding0gt                         ltfieldset stylewidth62 floatleft marginleft 19gt                          lttable stylewidth100gt                         lttrgt                              lttd stylewidth5gtltlabel stylewidthautogtTypeltlabelgtlttdgt                             lttdgtltselect stylewidth100gt                                 ltoptiongtMotherboardltoptiongt                                 ltoptiongtMemoryltoptiongt                                 ltoptiongtProcessorltoptiongt                             ltselectgtlttdgt                              lttd stylewidth5gtltlabel stylewidthautogtItemltlabelgtlttdgt                             lttdgtltselect stylewidth100gt                                 ltoptiongtMotherboardltoptiongt                                 ltoptiongtMemoryltoptiongt                                 ltoptiongtProcessorltoptiongt                             ltselectgtlttdgt                              lttdgtlta hrefgtltimg srcimagesicntrash.png stylewidthautogtltagtlttdgt                             lttdgtlta href classbtnAddInventorygtltimg srcimagesicnnewarticle.png stylewidthautogtltagtlttdgt                          lttrgt                         lttablegt                          ltfieldsetgtltdiv classcleargtltdivgt                     ltdivgt codepre
Negative 4317 pI recently tried using a Mass Product importer to import tier prices separated by customer group and it totally messed up my database. Like your average dummy, I didnt back up the database beforehand. Now that Ive learned my lesson on that front, Ive got the database back into what seems to be decent shape except for one thing my Product View page shows the Normal Price while my Category Page shows the appropriate Tier Price.p  pIve looked at the code and it seems that both end up calling templatecatalogproductprice.phtml to display the price. Ive tested changes with the code in price.phtml, view.html, list.html and I have searched high and low through the functions they call to find a way to fix it, but in reality this issue hadnt occurred until there was a database issue so anything I end up doing code wise would be a hack and even then I dont think Im knowledgeable enough to make that happen very quickly.p  pI TRUNCATED catalogproductentitytierprice AND catalogproductindextierprice so that I could start fresh. This fixed the original issue where all of the prices displayed wonky no matter what customer type was viewing.p  pI read somewhere that List and View draw from different parts of the database is there any way to get whatever tables these are back in line and I have my site displaying properlyp

Either by pinning a specific actor to a thread, or by instructing an actor to run on a specific thread at some point. a la ObjectiveCs performSelectorOnMainThreadp  pIs there a way to pin a rendering actor to the main thread, or have any actor run on the main thread at some point in the future, at which point it will be able to issue OpenGL calls or even some other solution, Im open to ideasp

Negative 4317 pProblem Weve upgraded the AD server from 2003 to 2008 and due to some bad code, where developer has coded in such a way that, he directly casts badPwdCount property value to INT and it blows up because of NULL value conversion  NULL reference exception  NULL cannot be converted to INT.p  pBigger problem We cannot do a deployment at this point because there are over 100 individual apps that depended on this change and were looking for a least involved way of dealing with it for now.p  pBackground Now the way this badPwdCount property works is, that when user logs on to the domain, it will get set to zero, otherwise its NULL.

Negative 4317 pI have read that Garbage collection is done in objective c using AUTOZONELIBAUTO.p  pAlso garbage collector is available upto OS X 10.8. While studying i was thinking what is the need of ARC if garbage collector is available. Then from the sources on stackoverflow.com, i learned the difference between ARC and garbage collector and advantages of both over each other.p  pNow i know that ARC works at compile time and garbage collector works at run time. Also ARC is not able to release memory of CFTypes, it only works for objective C types. And Garbage collector could release retain cycles that couldnt be done using ARC. p  pNow i wanted to know that can we use both ARC and garbage collector together, since both are available in os x 10.7. Also why is garbage collector deprecated after 10.8. Is ARC an alternative to garbage collector and it can release every kind object that was done by garbage collector.p  pAlso since garbage collector was not available in ios, then what was used in ios before ARC for garbage collection. Is manual memory management is able to manage everything if done correctly, and there is no need of garbage collection if Manual memory management is taken care of correctlyp

Negative 4317 pI want to run several threads and join them at the end of my main method, so I can know when they have finished and process some info.p  pI dont want to put my threads in an array and do a join one by one as join is a blocking method and I stay would waiting in the main thread for some threads still running, while other threads may have already finished, without having a possibility of knowing.p  pI have thought on the possibility of implementing an observer pattern for my threads An interface with a update method, an abstract class extending from thread or implementing runnable with set and get methods for the listeners and a class starting all my threads and waiting them to finish.p  pIf my understanding is right, an observer would not block in a specific join for a thread. Instead it will wait somehow until an update method is called by a thread to perform an action.

Negative 4317 pI just updated Newtonsoft.Json library from 4.5.1 to 5.0.8. What I noticed is that one of the exception messages changed. Once the value cant be deserialized, the following is contained in my 400 response, Error converting value.... Now, this message was different in the 4.5.1. version of the lib. The problem is that the full name of the object is exposed and that is for me an undesirable behavior.p  pHow can I overcome thisp  pThanksp  pEDIT in order to clarifyp  pThe problem is following. Till the version 4.5.1 of the Newtonsoft.Json library, once the JsonSerializationException was thrown, the message in the response just specified that a certain object was unable to be serialized. From that version on, the library in the response message, yes it includes the error message but also the full name of the object that it failed to serialize to. Thats a pity as I would not like to expose the namespace in the error message to the outside world.p  pMy question is, can I somehow rethrow an exception with specifying a different message, somewhere like the one in the 4.5.1p  pHope this helpsp  pThanksp  pMore info. p  pI was just checking the source code of the JSON lib and I found that the code in StringEnumConverter now isp  precodecatch Exception ex                              throw JsonSerializationException.Createreader, Error converting value 0 to type 1..FormatWithCultureInfo.InvariantCulture, MiscellaneousUtils.FormatValueForPrintreader.Value, objectType, ex              codepre  pmeanwhile it was throwing the default Enum.Parse ArgumentException with the message Must specify valid information for parsing in the string. before.p  pNow, I preferred this message as it was not showing to the users the internal namespace of my API.p  pIs there a way to overcome thisp  pThanksp  pEDIT Hans Passant I tried to hook up the event JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.Error in my ApplicationStart method, however I was unable to do what I intended to do.

Negative 4317 pFirst I have some programming experience but am a beginner with XAMLWPFStackOverflow. So please forgive anything stupid and ask if anything is not clearly described or you need additional info. Thanks.p  pIntroduction I have a base class codeItemcode with some properties like codeTitlecode, codeNotescode, etc..  From that I have some derived classes like codeContactItemcode, codeMediaItemcode, etc. with additional properties which act as base classes for further specialized item types e.g. codeImageItemcode, codeMusicItemcode and codeVideoItemcode which are derived from codeMediaItemcode codePersoncode and codeInstitutioncode are derived from codeContactItemcode.p  pIn WPF I want a page where multiple item types can be displayed together. I currently use an codeItemsPanelcode for this and started to specify data templates for each item type  and there are many more than 50.p  pProblem What I now want is some kind of inheritance of the item controls e.g. have a base codeUserControlcode with a codeContentPresentercode and add additional controls for additional properties of derived classescontrol templates.p  pWhat would be the best way to handle this in WPFXAML without having to copypaste the controls from the base classes for the derived item types in the data templatesp  pAny idea or hint in the right direction would be great.  If you need some code or additional info, please let me know.p

To confirm this, I tested a GLRGBAF32 internal format negative float data are clamped to 0, while positive data arent clamped at all.p  pThen theres all combinations of unsignedsigned normalizedunnormalized integer internal formats.p  pSo, when does pixel unpack, specifically codeglTexImage.Dcode, clamp data  Im specifically interested in codeGLRRGRGBRGBA81632IUISNORM16F32FDEPTHCOMPONENT162432code i.e., all the color floatingpoint and integer textures, plus all depth textures, but probably all internal formats should be addressed.p

Negative 4317 pI have 4 html files and 4 javascript files. Each javascript file is loaded externally from each html filep  pindex.html loads javascript.js 1.html loads javascript1.js 2.html loads javascript2.js 3.html loads javascript3.jsp  pThe issue that Im having is that index.html uses AJAX to load one of the 3 other pages when a specific button is pressed. Then what is supposed to happen is that particular page would load its own corresponding javascript program which at the end of that program contains a window.addEventListener that should run on load and run the function registerListeners. RegisterListeners then registers an event listener on a button on that page which currentyl just displays an alert for testing.p  pWhat I have figured out is that the parameter load for window.addEventLisener doesnt seem to be valid when the page is loaded dynamically with ajax.p  pI cant put all of the code in the main javascript because it contains some getElementById calls that call elements from one of the numbered pages that, if executed on main page load will generate errors because those specific IDs dont exist yet.p  pThis is homework and so I need to get pointed in the right direction to doing this with html5 and javascript WITHOUT jquery. I understand that it might be easier with jquery, but I need to figure out how to do it without for the time being.p  pWould there be such a thing as window.addEventListenerAJAXload, someFunction, false p

Negative 4317 pIm performing a Core Data lightweight migration, adding a new attribute to an existing object. For the sake of example, say Ive got Songs and Playlists, where theres a manytomany relationship between the two i.e., songs can be in multiple playlists, and playlists contain multiple songs.p  pI added a new Core Data model version, and then added a new Playlist attribute called codesongCountcode. I added the property to my model class manually, and then overrode the CoreDataGeneratedAccessors for adding a new codeSongcode to a codePlaylistcode like sop  precodedynamic songCount   voidaddSongObjectSong value      NSSet changedObjects  [[NSSet alloc] initWithObjectsampvalue count1]      [self willChangeValueForKeysongs                 withSetMutationNSKeyValueUnionSetMutation                    usingObjectschangedObjects]     [[self primitiveSongs] addObjectvalue]     [self didChangeValueForKeysongs                withSetMutationNSKeyValueUnionSetMutation                   usingObjectschangedObjects]       dont think the broadcasts are necessary when using the setter     [self willChangeValueForKeysongCount]     self.songCount  [[self primitiveSongs] count]     [self didChangeValueForKeysongCount]  codepre  pThis all works correctly. When I add a song to a playlist and then do a Core Data fetch against the playlist, the playlist has the correct value for codesongCountcode I can even have the fetch sort by song count, which was the whole point.p  pHowever, when I restart the app, the codesongCountcode attribute for all my Playlists is codenilcode. What did I miss I did a code[context save]code and the playlist does contain the new song, it just didnt save the song count. Its not a transient attribute, and the persistentStoreCoordinator doesnt complain about the migration. Im not sure what else could be going wrong, or where to look for debugging.p

Negative 4317 pThe quicktime documentation recommends the following approach to finding a keyframep  blockquote   pFinding a Key Framep      pFinding a key frame for a specified time in a movie is slightly more   complicated than finding a sample for a specified time. The media   handler must use the sync sample atom and the timetosample atom   together in order to find a key frame.p      pThe media handler performs the following stepsp      ol   liExamines the timetosample atom to determine the sample number that contains the data for the specified time.li   liScans the sync sample atom to find the key frame that precedes the sample number chosen in step 1.li   liScans the sampletochunk atom to discover which chunk contains the key frame.li   liExtracts the offset to the chunk from the chunk offset atom.li   liFinds the offset within the chunk and the samples size by using the sample size atom.li   ol blockquote  psource a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationQuickTimeqtffQTFFChap2qtff2.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationQuickTimeqtffQTFFChap2qtff2.htmlap  pThis is quite confusing, since multiple tracks trak atom will yield different offsets.

Negative 4317 pHey everyone so Im relatively new to AS3, I had a question. Im developing a Mobile Application for Android devices and all my objects that are on the stage and that are added to the stage are Movie Clips. After awhile I begin to notice a drop in FPS. I know that this is due to me not using the devices GPU. Also I have read a lot about 3rd party programs that make use of the GPU and enhance the performance immensely such as the Starling framework. Ive tried to implement that into my game and create the sprite sheets etc... But I just get error after error and i understand Im not as advanced in AS3 to truly grasp how to use it.  So I was wondering if replacing the movie clips with sprites would enhance the performance Or is that even possible. I know that Sprites are capable of working like move clips via able to add tweens etc... But will this enhance the performance of the game Or am i pretty much screwed unless I learn how to use the starling framework p  pAny help would be appreciated thanks everyone. p

Negative 4317 pI have a form with two interdependent fields, one a set of two radio buttons, the other a text field. p  pWhen the radio button has one value selected, the text field should be required. When the other field is selected, it is not required. Fairly simple in concept. p  pThis has been implemented through a function like the following, called upon form submissionp  precodefunction validateFormform, incremental      ...     validator  form.validate         ...         rules             textfieldname             required inputradio[nameauth]checked.val  A         ,         ...          return validator.form codepre  pSo, this works very well the first time the form is submitted. If the radio to allow an empty input is checked, the form submits ok. If the other button is checked, the form page shows the empty text field highlighted as an error.p  pHowever, after submitting an erroneous form where the text field was empty and the radio button mandating a value was checked, if I go ahead and leave the text field blank but change the radio button to allow a blank field, the form still does not submit, and the text field is still highlighted in error. p  pWhen I step through the javascript using Firebug debugger, I can see that it does restep through the validate function that ostensibly is creating a new validator, and I can see the expression for the required rule for the field is evaluating to false on the second submit, as expected. Yet, once the validate code is stepped through, I look at the resultant validator objects rule set within its settings, and they remain unchanged. Is the Validator for a form locked once its instantiated somehow, or is there any way to successfully update its rule set between validation runsp

Negative 4317 pSo Im writing an ASP.NET MVC application. One of my model classes depends on the Windows Server Update Services WSUS API provided by Microsoft. p  pI cant think of a good way to unit test this model class.  The main two approaches I can think of arep  p1 Write a stub of all the WSUS interfaces I use. The main drawback here is that these would be massive stubs. There are an enormous amount of methods in these interfaces. I dont have any paid tools at hand to speed up the task, either. Im just using Nunit.p  p2 Write a new interface in place of every WSUS interface that I use. Only declare the methods that I use in my model class. Classes will then implement these interfaces which just call the appropriate method from the WSUS API. Then when I write my stubs, I only have to implement the methods I use probably saving me 99 of the methods. The main drawback here is that whenever I change my model to use new methods from the WSUS API, I have to update my stub with new methods and also my wrapper classes. p  pBoth seem like somewhat naive approaches. But I cant think of anything else. What should I dop

Negative 4317 pGiven two Javascript objects codeAcode and codeBcode, is there a way to generate the a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6902 relnofollowJSON patcha, so that when that patch is applied to codeAcode it would change the objects properties to that of object codeBcodep  pFor example, given hypothetical codeJSONPatchcode function perhaps being a function of similar name to one of those linked below, what is desired is the codegeneratepatchcode function.p  pcode patch  generatepatchA, B JSONPatch.applypatch, A   modifies A so that it has the same properties as B. codep  pIn this question codeAcode and codeBcode are Javascript objects.

Negative 4317 pI was wondering which of the following two approaches are better for creating multiple records using the data mapper pattern.p  pFirstly, a little background  I have a web application. The interface is done in FlexActionscript and the business logic is done in php. HTTP requests are used to send requests and receive responses from the business logic. The business logic is implemented MVC style. A front controller loads the appropriate controller and executes the appropriate action when a valid request is received.p  pAs far as I understand the data mapper pattern, a model represents a single recordrow of the database. The application works great for creating, updating and retrieving single objects.p  pI am at the point where I would like to create several objects simultaneously. The two approaches I have in mind are as followsp  ol lipHave the interface perform a create request for each record that needs to be saved.pli lipSend an array of all the objects that need to be saved and have the controller call the mappers save action for each of the items in the array.pli ol  pOr is there a better way available for creating multiple recordsp

When I use an emulator for a Nexus 5 for example that has 1080p, the image doesnt scale to the screen and i get a scrollbar to the right.p  pTo understand the problem here is the image in a 720p screen a hrefhttpimgur.comVArmsmb relnofollowhttpimgur.comVArmsmba and the image in 1080p a hrefhttpimgur.com7zGkX0J relnofollowhttpimgur.com7zGkX0Jap  pThe xml of the fragment im displaying all thisp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationvertical gt      ltTextView         androidididtitle         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidtextstringtitle         androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceMedium         androidtextStylebold gt      ltScrollView         androidididsv         androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightfillparent         androidlayoutbelowidtitle         androidlayoutmarginTop10dp gt          ltRelativeLayout             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt              ltWebView                 androidididimgWebView                 androidlayoutwidthfillparent                 androidlayoutheightfillparent                 androidscrollbarStyleinsideOverlay                 androidtextstringdesc gt              ltWebView                 androidididtextWebView                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutbelowidimgWebView                 androidscrollbarStyleinsideOverlay                 androidtext gt              ltWebView                 androidididfullWebView                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidscrollbarStyleinsideOverlay                 androidtext                 androidvisibilitygone gt              ltButton                 androidididreadMore                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidlayoutbelowidtextWebView                 androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue                 androidtextstringfullArticle gt         ltRelativeLayoutgt     ltScrollViewgt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pand the code for this specific webview is thisp  precodefinal WebView imgW  WebView view.findViewByIdR.id.imgWebView WebSettings ws  imgW.getSettings         ws.setLayoutAlgorithmLayoutAlgorithm.SINGLECOLUMN         ws.setLightTouchEnabledfalse         ws.setPluginStatePluginState.ON         ws.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue         ws.setLoadWithOverviewModetrue         ws.setUserAgentStringMozilla5.0 Linux U Android 2.0 enus Droid BuildESD20 AppleWebKit530.17 KHTML, like Gecko Version4.0 Mobile Safari530.17  imgW.loadDataWithBaseURLhttpwww.liveplace.gr, imgCode, texthtml, UTF8, null codepre  pany idea why this may be happeningp

Negative 4317 pI have a simple question does the length of numbers that need to be sorted affects the sorting time  Example Suppose we need to sort 10 million 6 digit numbers like 204134 and 10 million 23 digit numberslike 24, 143 and to sort both the sets individually. Does the set with 6 digit numbers is gonna take more time than the the one with 23 digit numbers p  pI know the hardware use each logic gate for a single digit so 6 logic gates for 6 digits compared to 23 gates for other set but i dont know whether this affects the sorting time or not. Can someone explain me this. Helps will be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 4317 pIm doing some refactoring on a big project that have two types of testing projects Unit and Integration. The Unit testing projects are supposed to have tests that inherits UnitTest class, and the Integration testing projects, tests that inherit IntegrationTest. The problem now, is that in Unit there are some files that are Integration tests, and vice versa. Do you know a way to easily move files and keep the configuration in a way that the tests still runsp  pI created a batch, and it moved the files correctly. The problem is that the .csproj doesnt update automatically and also that there some classes that are not tests, but that are used by the tests. Mock up classes for example.p

The query will need to loop through each row and calculate the difference between dates, and return the first and last date associated with each episode. The goal is to group results by member and episode startend date.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12177951howtoidentifythefirstgapinmultiplestartandenddaterangesforeachdisA very similar questiona has been asked before, and was somewhat helpful. The problem is that in customizing the code, the returned tables are excluding first and last records.

Negative 4317 h2Problemh2  pThis has been driving me insane for days. We have a process here to import records from a strongcsv filestrong to the strongdatabasestrong, through a admin page which resides in a strongASP.NET Web Forms .NET 4.0strong project. The process itself was too slow and I was responsible to make it faster. I started by changing the core logic, which gave a good performance boost.p  pBut if I upload large files well strongrelatively largestrong, about 3 MB tops, I have to wait until the upload process finishes until I start importing, and I dont return any progress to the client while I do so. The process itself is not that long, it takes about 5 to 10 seconds to complete, and yes, Ive considered creating a separate codeTaskcode and polling the server, but I thought it was overkill.p  hr  h2What have I done so farh2  pSo, to fix this issue, Ive decided to read the incoming stream and import the values while im reading. I created a generic handler .ashx, and put the following code inside codevoid ProcessRequestHttpContext contextcodep  precodeusing var stream  context.Request.GetBufferlessInputStream   codepre  pFirst I remove the headers, then I read the stream through a codeStreamReadercode until I get a CRLF, convert the line to my model object, and keep reading the csv. When I get 200 records or so, I bulk update all of them to the database. Then, I keep getting more records until I end the file or get 200 records.p  pThis seems to be working, but then, Ive decided to stream my response as well. First, I disabled strongBufferOutputstrongp  precodecontext.Response.BufferOutput  false codepre  pThen, I added those headers to my responsep  precodecontext.Response.AddHeaderKeepAlive, true context.Response.AddHeaderCacheControl, nocache context.Response.ContentType  applicationXMyUpdate codepre  pThen, after sending those 200 records to the database, I write a responsep  precoderesponse.Writes response.Flush codepre  pcodescode is a string with a fixed size of 256 chars. I know 256 chars doesnt always equate 256 bytes, but I was just being sure I wouldnt write walls of text to the response and mess something up.p  pHeres its formatp  precode pipeline record delimiter 1 or 0 success or failure  delimiter error message if applicable  pipeline next demiliter and so on codepre  pExamplep  precode0Invalid price on line 123110Invalid id on line 127 codepre  pOn the client side, heres what I have just the request partp  precodefunction import     var formData  new FormData     var file  [dataidfile][0].files[0]     formData.appendfile, file      var xhr  new XMLHttpRequest     var url  SiteUpdate.ashx      xhr.onprogress  updateProgress      xhr.openPOST, url, true     xhr.setRequestHeaderContentType, multipartformdata     xhr.setRequestHeaderXFileName, file.name     xhr.setRequestHeaderXFileType, file.type     xhr.sendformData   function updateProgressevt     debugger  codepre  hr  h2What happened h2  ul liIt doesnt send the data immediately to the client when I call coderesponse.Flushcode. I understand there is buffering from the clientside, but it doesnt seem to be working at all, even when I send a lot of dummy data to bypass this issue.li liAfter some time, when I write too much stuff on codeResponse.Writecode, the method will become slower and slower until it hangs. Same with codeResponse.Flushcode. I guess Im missing something here.li liI created a simple webforms project to test what Ive been trying to do. It has a generic handler which will return a number each second for 10 seconds. It actually updates not always on a 1sec fashion and I can see the ongoing progress. li liWhen I write just a few lines to the response, it actually shows progress, but ALWAYS after the whole process is almost finishing. The main problem is when I get errors and I try to write these to the response. Theyre longer than codesuccesscode strings because they contain the error message.li ul  pI assume that if I write codeResponse.Flushcode its not 100 guaranteed to go to the client, correct Or is the client itself the problem If it is the client, why does the server hang when I call codeResponse.Writecode too muchp  pstrongEDITstrong As an addendum, if I throw the same piece of code into a aspx page, it works. So I believe it has something to do with the codexhrcode XMLHttpRequest itself, which is not prepared to process streaming data, it seems. p  pIll be glad to give more information if needed.p

Negative 4317 pNote before reading, Im new to apples to framework that Ive decided to jump into so I m not sure if this question will come across as help me please or an actual question that belongs here. I dont know if I will be using the correct terminology for the problem or rather query that I have. In any case please provide feedback asap, so I can edit my question if need be, if its not up to par. Anyway, back to the question.p  pIm in the process of building an app that uses the IPod Library Access API, so that I can play songs from itunes in the app. However I also need to access the audio data of whatever song is playing, like how a music visualizer would. So far, looking through the Audio Session documentation and the Core Audio documentation, I havent found any officially supported means of achieving this. As I understand it, it would require accessing audio data from another audio session, as in the Ipod access api, technically itunes is playing in the background as I understand it and thus has a different audio session. p  pSo basically how can you access audio data from another audio session Specifically getting the audio data of songs played through the IPod Access API p

Negative 4317 pIm working on a project for class using Java and UDP senders and receivers. The premise of the problem is to read in a text file, store the contents within a packet, send the packet, receive the packet, and read out the file on screen and create a new text document on the receiving computer of an identical text file.p  pI have all of that working. When I test with a local host it appears to work 100 of the time. When I send it from my laptop to my PC it appears to work 100 of the time. However, when I send it from my PC to my laptop it does not work. p  pI have several System.out debug statements to verify some of the information I send. I know that the text file should take 7 packets. However, whenever I send it from my PC to my laptop it says that I am sending 46 packets.p  pMy initial thought is that maybe the packets are being sent out of order. The first packet I am sending indicates how many packets the receiver should be expecting to receive. I thought maybe for some reason the 46 could indicate a capital F so I removed all the capital F and it still says Im sending 46 packets. p  pI thought maybe I was sending too much information at once so I used Thread.sleep to give my receiver time to keep up  that did not work either.p  pFinally, I read through the Oracle Documentation and some posts online and found out that UDP is unreliable. So, Im assuming it could potentially be that. However, I want to just verify that that could be the issue.p  pOr if anyone has a better idea as to what could be causing the problem that would be awesome as wellp  pThanks for your help p

This became messy as well the problem of addingremoving data after a columns visibility has been changed.  I noticed the data was not in its correct column. As a result, ive opted for setting the columns minWidth, preferredWidth and maxWidth.brbrp  pNow to my problem, the below code does not adjust the columns width when setColumnVisible is set to true.

I have a jtable that display installed fonts column1 displays the font family, column2 displays the alphabet in coresponding font and column3 displays digits09 in the corresponding font.brbrThe example code ive provided will be used to display the aboveforementioned, giving the user the option of hiding either the alphabet or digits.brbrI also have 6 jlists, 3 of which contain available font families, styles and sizes, and the other 3 contain user selections.  I use another jtable to display user selections column1 selected font family, column2 font style, column3 font size, column4 alphabet, column5 digits, column6 punctuation and column7 symbols.brbr The user will be allowed to select which columns are visible.  As ive mentioned though, when the display table is updated, the data is not where its supposed to be.  ie the user chooses to hide columns, digits and symbols and then selects a new fonts, styles and size to be displayed.p

Negative 4317 pI have a JTable that is sorted and filtered using a RowSorter and updates in a real time manner.  I have an issue when users are trying to create a selection interval with either the mouse click  drag over rows or via the keyboard SHIFT  arrow down multiple times.p  pThe selection interval start and end get corrupted as soon as a tablemodel update event occurs.  I have discovered that if a table is sorted and there is more than one selected row the selection model fires multiple list selection events that clear then recreate the selection on every  table model update.p  pIf multiple rows are selected one at a time  all is well.  What the user selected remain selected.  If however the user tries to create a selectioninterval by clicking and dragging the mouse down over multiple rows  the rows get selected correctly until a table model update event fires.  The selection then starts building from the currently selected row.p  pIve attached a small demo application.   Try selecting multiple rows using the mouse  every second the selection will get corrupted....p  pThis seems to be a bug or unwanted behavior in the Java classes.

Negative 4317 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26197386whyismytimerobservablenevercalled2619771626197716Why is my timer Observable never calleda  Miguel Lavigne saysp  pKeep in mind that if youre using Observables from within a Fragment or an Activity you should always make sure you unsubscribe from your Observables to eliminate chances of memory leaks.p  pIt is clear to me how it works as long as I am using an Observable in an Activity, Fragment or View. But what if I am using it where there is no contextp  pMy situation I am having an external library which holds an object model. Each object has a .save function, which is called from the UI. In save, an API endpoint call is performed by an Observable asynchronously.p  pExamplep  precodepublic Overlay save          Observable.createnew Observable.OnSubscribeltOverlaygt           Override public void callSubscriberlt super Overlaygt subscriber              try                  Overlay overlay OverlayEndpoint.insertOverlaythis  call the API endpoint here                 subscriber.onNextoverlay                 subscriber.onCompleted              catch IOException e                  subscriber.onErrore                            .subscribeOnSchedulers.newThread.observeOnAndroidSchedulers.mainThread             .subscribenew Action1ltOverlaygt                   Override public void callOverlay overlay                       process the saved result [omitted for brevity]                               , new Action1ltThrowablegt                   Override public void callThrowable throwable                       put the overlay into a local upload queue in case the endpoint is unreachable [omitted]                                     return this  return the call immediately  codepre  pThe Observable is for onetime use within save and becomes obsolete thereafter. How can I make sure it does not persistp  pSituation 1 Normal unsubscribe. Is there a way to unsubscribe right from within the call, once processing is completep  pSituation 2 For whatever reason the Observable stays in memory. Could I use .timeout to ensure the Observable is destroyed after enough time has passedp

Negative 4317 pHow do I send an email using the Java Mail API that contains large attachments 25 MB The attachments are files stored online with our cloud storage provider Google Cloud Storage. The API for the service returns an InputStream object or a ReadableByteChannel object for each file.p  pI cant use ByteArrayDataSource to create a MimeBodyPart because it creates a copy of the entire file that resides in the memory, and we get a OutOfMemory exception. p  pIf its a physical file, we can create a FileDataSource object and attach to the email. But can we do it with an InputStream objectp  pI cant increase the heap size because increasing it to 25MB seems like a very bad idea. If you have any other ideas too, please let me know.

Negative 4317 pI have the a script which imports possibly every .py from the subdirectory emmymodulesem. This folder contains codeinit.pycode which features codeall  [mod1, mod2, ...]code. These are added manually to the codeinit.pycode.p  pThe number and names of the modules may differ from time to time but always need to offer the same functions codefunc1, func2, func3ncode.p  pHow could I check which modules were imported e.g. codeallcode and the subdir both offer emmod1em and emmod2em, so I want to codeprintmod1, mod2code I considered reading the codeinit.pycode file, parsing the codeallcode list and then comparing it with the codelistdircode of emmymodulesem. Maybe there is a faster or more simple way.p  pAlso do I need to check if all three functions codefunc1, func2, func3ncode are there. My initial thought was to read the file, parse and check for codedef func1code and so on, but again, I assume theres a better way. p

Negative 4317 pThe stuff Ive read about .net caching says that the .net 4.0 System.Runtime.Caching is the preferred method for caching as opposed to the earlier .net 2.0 System.Web.Caching.p  pBut in a recent project, I was trying to specify some levels of priority on items put in the cache, so that when the cache runs out of space and needs to do a cleanup, the less important items are removed before the more important ones.p  pThis was previously able to be done with System.Web.Caching.CacheItemPriority a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.caching.cacheitempriorityvvs.110.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.caching.cacheitempriorityvvs.110.aspxa.

Negative 4317 pI am using a custom Left Menu Controller which can be opened by codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode when the codeUINavigationControllercode is only at its TopLevel. If some codeUIViewControllercode is pushed onto the stack, I want the codeinteractivePopGestureRecognizercode to work as expected and pop the VC when user swipes from lefttoright instead of the LeftMenu being opened. To achieve this, i subclassed the codeUINavigationControllercode as followsp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     [self.interactivePopGestureRecognizer setDelegatenil]     [self.view addGestureRecognizer[self createPanGestureRecognizer]]    UIPanGestureRecognizer  createPanGestureRecognizer      SGFPanGestureRecognizer  panRecognizer  [[SGFPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorpanGestureRecognized]     return panRecognizer   voidpushViewControllerUIViewController viewController animatedBOOLanimated      ifself.viewControllers.count  1         ifself.view.gestureRecognizers ampamp self.view.gestureRecognizers.countgt0             for UIGestureRecognizer  recog in self.view.gestureRecognizers                              if[recog isKindOfClass[SGFPanGestureRecognizer class]]                      [self.view removeGestureRecognizerrecog]                     break                                   [super pushViewControllerviewController animatedanimated]   UIViewController popViewControllerAnimatedBOOLanimated      UIViewController  vc  [super popViewControllerAnimatedanimated]     ifself.viewControllers.count  1         [self.view addGestureRecognizer[self createPanGestureRecognizer]]     return vc  codepre  pEverything is working fine except one When i am at a detailViewController and I swipe from left, the VC starts the POP animation which goes along my finger. If I leave the gesture too quick, the detailViewController doesnt really gets popped and rolls back the popping animation. However, this action fires the codepopViewControllerAnimatedcode and my logic above becomes useless.p  pSUMMARY So is there a way to understand if the swipetoback gesture is released too early to really pop the codeUINavigationControllercodep

If the sign is negative, I color the cube face green and the opposing cube face yellow. p  pBy verifying how faces are colored in the rendering, I can verify that my calculation tells me which face indices represent the faces that are closest.p  pHere is the relevant code I am using in my coderendercode function also available via the demo sitep  precodefor var cubefaceidx  0 cubefaceidx lt cube.geometry.faces.length cubefaceidx      var face  cube.geometry.faces[cubefaceidx]     var facetocamera  new THREE.Vector3     facetocamera.copycamera.position     facetocamera.subcube.geometry.vertices[face.a]     var dp  face.normal.dotfacetocamera     if dp gt 0          cube.geometry.faces[cubefaceidx].materialIndex  0  red material         cube.geometry.faces[cubefaceidx  6  12].materialIndex  1  blue material          else          cube.geometry.faces[cubefaceidx].materialIndex  2  green material         cube.geometry.faces[cubefaceidx  6  12].materialIndex  3  yellow material       codepre  pThe problems I am running into are thesep  ol lipWhen I rotate the cube, I am rotating the camera, and so the coloring of the cube faces should also be changed, so that the camera always sees the same cube face colors relative to the cameras new position. However, the coloring follows the face as the cube is rotated. pli lipThe coloring of red and blue faces should be opposite within the cube. Likewise. the coloring of green and yellow faces should be opposite within the cube. However, some green and yellow faces are adjacent. Additionally, red and blue faces are adjacent and not opposite. As the cube is rotated counterclockwise around the yaxis, a blue face is opposite a yellow face. This should not happen.pli ol  pMy goal is to calculate the three closest faces of the cube, so that I can get their vertices and draw axes. p  pI am hoping with the above calculation to determine which faces are closest at any given camera position. However, the coloring follows the faces as the cube is rotated, so I cannot know from this approach which faces are closest.p  pBased on the coloring pattern showing up on adjacent faces, I think my indexing of cube faces is also incorrect.p  pHow might I fix my calculation step to address the two problems and correctly identify the faces closest to the camerap

Negative 4317 pI have a question about android sliders and adjacent focusable widgets.  First some backgroundp  pIn a PC hScrollBar you can adjust the current value with three methods 1 dragging the thumb 2 click on the track  thumb moves by large increment 3 click on arrows at either end  thumb moves by small increment the last can be used for quick precision increments around an area of interest.p  pin an Android SeekBar you can adjust the current value with three methods 1 dragging the thumb 2 click on the track  thumb moves to click point 3 arrow keys  move thumb by set amount.p  pSounds like a pretty close match.  strongHoweverstrong, the arrow keys are only permanently available on a device with a hardware keyboard.p  pObviously, they may be found in some soft keyboards [not all], but it seems really messy to me to have that on display all the time, or else popping up when you touch the slider.  p  pOne obvious way round this would be to put buttons at each end of the slider and use them to increment the thumb position left or right.p  pHowever in the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetSeekBar.html relnofollowandroid docs for seekbara  I find this statement near the top strongPlacing focusable widgets to the left or right of a SeekBar is discouragedstrong.p  pTHE Questionp  pI just cant find anything more about this statement.  Is this purely a cosmetic rule, or is there some practical reason behind itp  pstrong[Edit]strong Ive just remembered that a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuiuievents.html relnofollowbuttons in touch mode are not focusablea by default, so this rule does not apply to them, so I could safely have arrow buttons on either side of the seekbar. p  pHowever I shouldnt use focusable widgets like EditBoxes  Id still like to know why that is so. strong[Edit]strongp

Negative 4317 pI want to connect to the Google Play Services Location API in a service so I can request location updates and geofencing. The example on the Android developer site makes the connection in an Activity using the activity lifecycle methods to connect and disconnect, it also handles failure by displaying dialogs etc. In my app I want to use a service rather than an Activity as I want to keep receiving location updates when the activity isnt visible. I am planning on connecting to Google Play Services when the service is started and disconnecting when I no longer require location updates or when the service is stopped. Is it possible to handle the connection failure scenarios from the service as it doesnt have access to an Activity to display the dialogs etcp  pThanksp

Negative 4317 pFor shared element transition I am following a hrefhttpsgithub.comrnrneverdiesHeroTransition relnofollowthisa github project. It has 2 screens  one with recyclerview having number of cards amp second the detail screen. As expected, it exhibits shared element transition of imageview amp textview from recyclerview item to detail screen amp reverse transition on back press. p  pBut, if user changes orientation on detail screen, amp then presses back button then the reverse transition animation doesnt work. Looking at a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvRhiPJByIMrM relnofollowthisa videos frames between 249 to 257 it seems to be possible even after orientation change. Any idea on thisp  pEditp  pPlease check a hrefhttpsvid.meLpEf relnofollowthis videoa for better understanding.p

Negative 4317 pBuilding an app that pulls data from SQL Server, creates a new excel file, throws that data in and saves the file to a remote server.  p  pEdit. I have researched and found several ways of doing this and the most pertinent to my particular situation seem to be doing it in the stored proc that is pulling the data, or in the app that fires the SP, either using the excel interop library in C, or using the ROWSET functions in SQL Server.p  pI have no preference other than using the latest technology.

Negative 4317 pIm writing a game that is similar to Pacman, but much more simplified in pygame. In this game, I want to make it so that when the player collides with my games equivalent to the ghosts from Pacman henceforth referred to as bees, a sound effect plays and while its playing I want the players image to change, the bees to disappear, and text to appear on the screen and then reset the players image and the bees to reset positions. However, when I run my program and have the player collide with a bee, the sound effect plays, but the text and the new image only appear for a split second as the sound effects duration ends. how do I get these things to appear and get the bees to disappear for just the duration of this sound effect.

Negative 4317 pIm doing some research on how iPhone manage the heap and stack but its very difficult to find a good source of information about this. Im trying to trace how a password is kept in memory, even after the codeNSStringcode is deallocated.p  pAs far as I can tell, an iPhone will not clear the memory content write zeros or garbage once the release count in ARC go down to 0. So the string with the password will live in memory until that memory position is overridden.p  pTheres a debug option in Xcode, codeMalloc Scribblecode, to debug memory problems that will fill deallocated memory with code0x55code, by enablingdisabling this option and disabling Zombies, and after a memory dump of the simulator using codegcorecode I can check if the content has been replaced in memory with code0x55code. p  pI wonder if this is something that can be done with the Apple Store builds, fill deallocated memory with garbage data, if my assumption that iPhone will not do that by default is correct or not, or if theres any other better option to handle sensitive data in memory, and how it should be cleared after using it Mutable data maybe write in that memory positionp

Negative 4317 pWe have an Android app that we would like to make brandable by building certain clients customized external APKs containing resources for our app to use in place of its default colors and images.p  pAfter investigating a variety of different ways of getting the resources out of this external APK and into the main app, Ive settled on using ContentProviderContentResolver along with a contract class specifying some constants for elements Id like to make brandable ie, skinnable. For the first pass, the only elements we care about are the logo on the main screen, a few icons, and the foreground and background colors throughout the various layouts.p  pFor the logo images, since our Activities extend our own base activity, I opted to add a SkinDrawable annotation and handle some annotation processing to automatically look up a resource using a ContentResolver and replace the Drawable on an ImageView to which the annotation is applied.  This works well.p  pWhere Im running into some trouble is with foreground and background colors, however.  Since themes are immutable, I cant look up some color values via the ContentResolver and make changes to the Theme.  I also dont want to package every possible theme with our main app, and of course because of how Android does things, it isnt like I can move a theme across using the ContentResolverProvider.p  pIts easy enough to make foregroundbackground color changes on the root view, but Im struggling with how to deal with the cases of all the various components eg, TextViews, Buttons, EditTexts, ListViews containing other Views, etc without significantly polluting our code with loads of setTextColor, setForegroundColor, etc calls.p  pIve looked through some of the older answers, and most of them seem to be doing some variant on exactly this either using factory methods or having lots of theming logic inside the Activity code or subclassing every View class with a custom implementation... all of these things are things I could do, but they seem clumsy.p  pSo my question is this is there a better or cleaner way than these optionsp

Negative 4317 pI have multiple ArrayLists with the same capacity. I fill these lists by reading a file.p  pI know that one difference between an Array and an ArrayList is that the Array have a fixed capacity while the ArrayList have a variable capacity.

Negative 4317 pAs we know java class loading works like in picture below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI1RPh.png altenter image description herep  pWhen we have a notion of plugin in our application like app servers we sometimes need some classes to be loaded in the instances class loader rather than in parent, so that each new instance plugin, webapp or whatever loads that particular class not delegating the parent... p  pFor example Log4j classes, we need them to be loaded for emeachem instance.p  pSo in order to do this the best approach that came into my mind is to write custom classloader that will take a list of class names which shall be prevented from being delegated to parent classloader ideally we want instances to be in complete isolation.p  pSo the the application that will load other instances will use that custom classloader while loading those instances...p  pstrongIs there an implementation of such classloader that solves this issue given that we dont want to know what OSGi is and we work with pure java no frameworks etc...strongp  pMy searches end up pointing some frameworks or some web container specific solutions, yet this is quite a simple task that is solved with one class, Id like to find out if im missing something before i start implementing it.p  pUpdate digging deeper  suppose there is a class loaded by bootstrap which has static state that can be shared between instances and we really badly want to make sure instances are completely isolated, now that class is obviously not included in our classpath, but it is loaded, and if we copy it instead of reffering it we will achieve the required isolation. p  pstrongSo do we have the notion of copying or cloneing a class from one classloader to otherstrongp

Everything compiles to a WAR file just fine.p  pI then deployed the WAR file by loading the servers Tomcat Manager GUI and using the strongWAR file to deploystrong feature.  When I do so, the WAR file is copied, and the application starts.

Negative 4317 pIm currently using a TableView to create a view that Im populating with different info. One of these cells is just an ImageView that displays a backdrop of a variable size. Im trying to set the proper constraints for this, but Im running into two different issues depending on what I try. p  pAll of the reference images are in this album a hrefhttpimgur.coma8Iqyw relnofollowhttpimgur.coma8Iqywa.p  pIf I set up simple constraints on the view in the container and on the imageView itself, like the first image, I end up getting a really messed up image like the second image. This image has a totally wrong aspect ratio. p  pIf I just put constraints on the View itself the third image, the image displays with the proper size, but the tableView assumes that the size of the cell is 0 and ignores it, which leaves me with something that looks like the fourth image. Notice how the cell with the poster and title is hidden under the image  p  pIm assuming that theres something simple Im missing here, but Im close to tearing my hair out with this issue. Im using Swift if that makes any difference at all.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 4317 pSPOILER ALERT This question refers to a 4clojure.com question. If youre a Clojure newbie like me, you probably want to try it by yourself first.p  pI answered this question 68 successfully, but only after making a mistake which Im still not sure why is wrong. p  pHeres the questionp  precode    loop [x 5          result []]     if gt x 0       recur dec x conj result  2 x       result codepre  pMy initial answer was code[6 5 4 3 2]code while the accepted answer is code[7 6 5 4 3]code.  I dont totally grok it, because codedec xcode emprecedesem codeconj result  2 xcode, and theyre both equally nested in the loop. Id thought that because the decrement seems to happen before the conjoin, the result vector would begin with a decremented x plus two. But its not happening that way. This is clearly something very basic, but perhaps someone might explain it whats going on  Thanks. p
Negative 4317 pWe have a hierarchical data store currently in SQLite where each item has both a Flag property getset and a ChildHasFlagSet property get only, but cached.  This way, when displaying the heirarchy in the UI, users can quickly drill down to find flagged items.p  pTo clarify, when an items flag is set, internally it runs up the parents and makes sure each ones ChildHasFlagSet is set to true. If the items flag is cleared however, it queries each level for any other children that have their flag set.  This way, ChildHasFlagSet is efficiently stored so retrieval is quick and no parsing of child hierarchies is needed.p  pWhat Im struggling with is who has ownership of the ChildHasFlagSet property should it be the modelapp, or the data store currently SQLite.p  pIf its in the model, that means if you were to retrieve a child far down in the hierarchy, then you would have to load all of its ancestors and set them as well.  This means youd need to maintain some sort of lookup to ensure there is only ever one instance of an item.p  pOn the flipside, if we implement this logic in the database via triggers for instance, then you have the possibility that objects in memory are out of sync with the database. Sure you could make them refresh, but if you have to refresh them, youd have to get them anyway, so youre right back to the modelmanagement approach.p  pAny thoughts on different ways to handle thisp  pMp

Negative 4317 pI have a rather huge set of predictors to do a modelselection on, for the sake of simplicity this example will however work with the codemtcarscode dataset.
