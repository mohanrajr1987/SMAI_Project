Positive 46220 pI am creating a Chrome extension that allows you to view, update, create, and remove your Chrome bookmarks. I would also like to be able load and save a users bookmarks through our server instead of syncing through a google account. The problem Im having is that Im not sure how we would sync these bookmarks across devices. Since the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.chrome.comextensionsbookmarks relnofollowChrome bookmarks APIa does not have any methods to loadsync a tree, I figure I will save each bookmarkfolder in an array on the server such as p  precode[id , parentId , index , title , url , ...] codepre  pWhen a user logs into their account on a new devicebrowser, I obtain the bookmarkfolder array from the server and loop through them. In the loop, I would use Chrome.bookmarks.get with the ID to check if that bookmark already exists, and if it does not, then use the create function to create that bookmark. Problem is, there is no way that I can see in the documentation to specify the ID of the newly created bookmarkfolder. What if the bookmarkfolder created on a new devicebrowser has a different ID then the original devicebrowser Then using the get function which requires you specify the ID you are looking for would not allow me to compare bookmarks correctly. Is there another solution for this problem p

Negative 46220 pI need a good understanding of the inner workings of System.Web.Routing. Usually we define the RoutesTable. But how does it do the routingp  pThe reason Im asking it is that I want to pass the routing to subapps. What I want to see working is a way of passing the current request to mvc apps that work in other AppDomains. Just to make it clear this is what Im imagining I have a MVC APP that only has the barebone Global.asax and that loads in other app domains some dlls that are mvc apps.. and the comunication is done through a transparent proxy created through appDomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap....p  pHope this is clear enough.p  pstrongEditstrong from what I can tell the codebehind Default.aspx is invoked on the first page reguest and that starts the MvcHttpHandler that does all the voodoo of displaying the pages we are requesting.

Negative 46220 pHave C questionp  pIve been searching for a way to lets say dynamic created objects at runtime by iterating though them and there propertiesmethods. so far ive played with using Reflections and foreach to illiterate the class properties. This is to display all records in various tables on a Data Grid view.  However one approach I think is to use Objectrational mapping to connect, populate a dataset and then be able to display it on the Data Grid view for editing etc..p  pemEditem Maybe iterating over the actually namespace of classes, all the classes inherit a class called Table so I guess there should be a method in invoking all classes at runtime to fetch the data from the databasep  pIve done mostly Java programming up until now so have a good idea of OOprogramming just not so familiar with .NET so looking for the best approach in this.p  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 46220 pHey Please let me know if this is bad practice or in someway a bad thing to do. The thing is in my program I need to make a method which goes through the root element and all child nodes of that element. My elements are like thisp  precodeIDParentAdditinal info   1       0      root element        2       0      root elemnet        3       1     child element of 1   4       1     child element of 1   5       3     child element of 3  codepre  pNow If I want to recieve all children of element with ID 1 no matter if it has 1000 children or just 2 like in this example I want my method to bring this too me, but Im not sure how to do it All of these elements are in a List, and this is what Im working with. For each time I find an element I need to check if it has any children, the same goes with the children. This is because I need to output the elements in correct order. Ive been thinking of maybe make it so I first make a map of the layout, and then use the map for outputting, but Im kinda stuck with the idea.p  pAny clues p
Negative 46220 pLets start from another behavior even if you declare methodvariable as private, another instance of the same class can access it. Its OK I can live with it. I call these class private and not instance private.p  pNow the question part For example, in runtime I want to be able to check that all String variables in codethiscode class are not null, and if they are null they should be changed to NULL string.p  pI run through the variables in reflection and get their values. But if I extend my class and add private or even protected variables my base class cant access them. I have to setAccessible on the variables before I can use it.p  pSo please explain to me why the baseclass superclass cant access privateprotected variables from its subclass. It is its subclass, so I dont get it. Whats the idea behind thisp  pI know that superclass should not know about its subclasses, but in my example it makes sense, nop  pIs it because I cant or shouldnt restrict my subclasses in this wayp  phr p  pstrongUpdatestrong Based on the answers, I want to know also Why accessing another instances private variables from the same class instance isnt considered violation of encapsulation p

Negative 46220 pShort question how can I test whether or not a directory in my website is in practice writable for the rest of the world even outside my own machinep  pContextp  pI run this website where the hosting provider has implemented an odd security system. To let PHP write files to disk on the linux server, the target dir should have write permissions for everyone.p  pTo me this would seem like a gaping security hole note there are no users uploading stuff, only my PHP script generating files, but my host told me its safe, as theyve got other unspecified security measures in place to keep the world from accessing my target directory. I am skeptical, so I want to make sure all is safe.p  pSo, I know my directory permissions  I have set them and tested them. I know my script can write to that directory. Now I want to make sure I really am the only one who can write to that dir, despite having given everyone file permissions to do so.p  pFor example is there a PHP function to write to a remote directory, like codefopenhttpdomain.tldfooevilhack.php, wcode I have tested emthatem and it doesnt work, but that doesnt prove to me that somebody else wont find another way.p

Negative 46220 pI am trying to sort a buffer full of variablelength records alphabetically in C. I previously asked how to implement this, and was told to sort an array of pointers to the records. I set up an array of pointers, but realized that each pointer points to the beginning of a record, but there is no way of it knowing when the record stops. When I try to print out the record pointed to by each pointer in the array, therefore, for each pointer, I get the entire buffer of all records, starting from the one pointed to. For example, if the buffer holds Helloworld, and there is a pointer at each letter, printing the array of pointers would produce Helloworldelloworldlloworldloworldoworldworldorldrldldd. Obviously, this is not what I want also, the qsort does not seem to be working on the array of pointers either. When I debug, the memory spaces pointed to by the pointers seem to hold very odd characters that are definitely not part of the ascii character set and were not included in my input file. I am very confused.  Below is my code how can I do this without getting the odd results I get now Thank you so much, bsg.p  precodeint tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      allocate memory for the buffer     buff  unsigned char  malloc2048     realbuff  unsigned char  mallocNUMRECORDS  RECORDSIZE  fp  fopenpostings0.txt, r         iffp                      freadbuff, 1, 2048, fp             forint i0 i lt30 i                 cout ltlt buff[i] ltltendl              int y0   create a pointer to an array of unsigned char pointers     unsigned char pointerarray[NUMRECORDS]     point the first pointer in the pointer array to the first record in the buffer             pointerarray[0]  ampbuff[0]             int recordcounter  1              iterate through each character in the buffer      if the character  is a line feed denoting a new record,  point the next pointer in the pointer array to the next  character in the buffer that is, the start of the next record                 forint i0i lt2048 i                              ifbuff[i]  char10                                      pointerarray[recordcounter]  ampbuff[i1]                     recordcounter                          the actual qsort NUMRECORDS is a constant declared above omitted here     qsortpointerarray, NUMRECORDS, sizeofchar, comparator                    else              cout ltlt sorry          cout ltlt sizeofpointerarraysizeofchar     forint k0 k lt sizeofpointerarraysizeofchark              cout ltlt pointerarray[k]       int comparatorconst void  elem1, const void  elem2       iterate through the length of the first string     whilefirstString  char10              returnstrcmpfirstString, secondString                  firstString         secondString                       return 0      codepre

The lack of improvement in duration in the failing parallel version is I assume due to that fact that the calls to Random are not processed in parallel even though I see that the parallel version uses both cores, whereas the original doesnt. The piece I really dont get is why the simulation results are what they are.  p  pOne separate worry I have is that if I use Random instances local to each loop, I may run into the problem of having multiple loops starting with the same seed the issue you get when you generate multiple Randoms too close in time, resulting in identical sequences.  p  pAny insight in what is going on would be very valuable to mep

Negative 46220 pI dont know from where should I start solving this problem. p  pIt seems that the Math department at UGA once again dropped the ball , and forgot the value of pi. You are to write a function called mypi which consumes a number that specifies the required accuracy and approximates the value of pi to that accuracy. You are going to the following algorithm based on geometric probability.p  pThink about a quarter circle inside of a unite square the quarter circle has area pi4. You pick a random point inside the square. if it is in the quarter circle, you get a hit and if not, you get a miss. The approximate area of the quarter circle will be giving by the number of hits divided by the number of points you chose.p  pYour function should repeat the process of counting hits and misses until at least 10,000 tries have been made, and successive estimates of pi are within the prescribed accuracy. it should return the estimated value of pi.p  pHINT 1 Use the function rand... in this problem.p  p2 Think about the probability that a random point ends up in the quarter circle.  You can simulate this probability by counting how many random points end up in the quarter circle.  This means you must geometrically define where the quarter circle is and have a script that can determine if the random point in the square is inside the boundaries of the quarter circle.   p

Negative 46220 pi need a module that is kind of a cross between a registration module and a form module.p  pit need to allow for custom form fields to be saved to the DB and work as part of a flow such that once data is entered by the users they click next and see the data to confirm it is correct. at this point they should have the option to edit the data if they notice an error or continue to a payment page.p  pthe payment page needs to have a module that can integrat with payment gateways liek paypal and accept credit cards. once credit card data is entered and the transaction is complete a custom email with a unique userNumber needs to be sent to the user.p  pi figure im lookign at three separate modules for this typeof work flow. but i hope since this is a standard type of register, pay, email confirm operation there may be a single module i can confugure to meet my needs.p  pthoughts suggestionsp
Negative 46220 pAccording to most of the reading I have done, a bidirectional search algorithm is said to terminate when the forward and backward frontiers first intersect. However, in Section 3.4.6 of emArtificial Intelligence A Modern Approachem, Russel and Norvig statep  blockquote   pBidirectional search is implemented by replacing the goal test with a check to see   whether the frontiers of the two searches intersect if they do, a solution has been found.   It is important to realize that the first solution found may not be optimal, strongeven if the   two searches are both breadthfirst some additional search is required to make sure there   isnt a shortcut across the gap.strongp blockquote  pI have considered this statement for quite some time, but am unable to find an example of this behavior. Can anyone provide an example graph where the first intersection between the forward and backward frontiers of a bidirectional BFS or A search is not the shortest pathp  pstrongEditstrong Clearly BFS will not find the shortest path in a weighted graph. It sounds like this excerpt is referring to bidirectional BFS on a undirected graph. Alternatively, I would be interested in seeing a counterexample using bidirectional A on a weighted graph. p

Negative 46220 pI am having a problem making changes to the properties of objects in an IEnumerable collection.

This works within the method but once the method is done executing and returns to the caller the changes are lost. However, if I convert the IEnumerable to a list it works as expected.

Negative 46220 pIs there any debugger that allows Python code to be changed while debuggingp  pIn other words runtime exception occurs, debugger stops, I change the code any way I like, and tell the program to continue.p  pstrongI am awarestrong of the problems with this approach, such that references to functions would still point to the old definitions if I redefine the function on the fly, and so on.

Negative 46220 pWhen a user visits my website there is a Login link on every page. Clicking this uses some JavaScript to show an overlay window where the user is prompted for their credentials.

Negative 46220 pI wrote this string copy routine for C strings. It is supposed to behave like strlcpy, that is  null terminate the destination if size  0, and return the length of the source string.p  pHowever I also want the function to fail if either the source or destination pointer is null, and somehow notify this to the caller.

Negative 46220 pI am trying to display an image sent over a local network to my android device.  An image is sent from a computer via tcp to my android device.  The image is a png.  The data sent over is a byte array stream of the png, which is packaged into a google protobuf message.  On the android side, when receiving the data, it is read into a byte array, and the array is then given to codeBitmapFactory.decodeByteArraycode.  However, this returns null roughly 90 of the time.  This only happens on a real device, but I can only test on the htc incredible at the moment.  Ive tried this on the android sdk emulator and i can get my image 100 of the time.p  pOther issues relating to BitmapFactory online has always been related to using file streams, where decoding isnt getting the entirety of the data, but I have yet to find any solutions for when the developer is sure the entirety of the data is received, and it only happens on a real device.p  pIs there some type of usage that I am unaware of for codedecodeByteArraycode  The codebyte[]code I am passing in is just the file itself.p  pEdit  Resolved thanks to a second insight from Brian Cooley.p  pI was just too quick to judge that the error may be in decodeByteArray.  If anyone ever runs into this problem do make sure that you make sure you have the data in its entirety.  I made the false assumption that my byte stream was good.  So first do a quick diff of the data youre sending and receiving, and make sure youre getting what you should.p

Negative 46220 pIm building an application using MVC 3 and Entity Framework 4. Ive created my Entity Data Model and generated a database from it. Now I know the validation attributes such as [Required] or [StringLength5] can be used on the model properties to provide validation both clientside and serverside.p  pI would like to know if these attributes can also be generated dynamically instead of having to add them to the model explicitly I saw that in EF 4.1 RC you can make use of the Fluent API to further configure your model in the OnModelCreating method by using the DbModelBuilder class.

From what I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5150795ef4codefirstvsmodelfirstwithregardstomodelvalidation herea it seems that just passing the models directly to the view would remove the need to add annotations to the models as well as the view models. However that means that you can no longer use strongly typed views when you do joins on the models and pass those to the view directlyp

If the compiler fails in that case, why would there be any ambiguity when the two codeacode functions are presentp  pIve tried with VS2010 and g v. 4.5. Both give me the exact same ambiguity.p

Like no idea what Im saying the link wasnt in the DOM.p  pI got frustrated for a bit and then tried wrapping the script in a codeltdivgtcode and doing an html page replacement on the whole script. I HTML replaced the greyed out complete with a complete link and then HTML replaced the script right after.  Interestingly that worked, but Im really curious as to why it worked.    When you ajax insert a script through an HTML replacement, does that inserted script have access to the modified DOM where the original script only has access to the what was the original DOM from the page loadp  precodeltdiv idhtmlreplacesriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt       .completeticketlink .clickfunction         var url  this.attrhref           formload.loadurl,             function                  this.dialog                         modaltrue,                         draggable true,                         resizable false,                         widthauto,                         heightauto,                         title  Complete Ticket ,                         position [125, 50]                                       return false            ltscriptgt ltdivgt codepre  pThanks  much apprecaitedp

The usual stuff keyword, order, date, price, etc.  The question is not the use of JS, which is obvious, but the origin of the data.

Another person defends that we should use a JSON generated in the server, and that JSON should be the datas origin. p  pWhat you guys think on this What are the pros and consp  pAs a final request, I would like you to be the most informative as possible since your answers will be used and referenced for all us in the company.

Negative 46220 pI am in the middle of developing an android application and I have stumbled across something that I dont really know the best way to solve.p  pWhat I wwant to achieve is, when a user logs into the application, I want to start a thread if the device is connected to a networkwhat kind of network doesnt matterp  pThe thread should perform an action every 10 minutes.p  pWhat this thread needs to do is, loop trough a list, a queue to be more exact. This queue will have objects, and based on the objects in the queue when there is a connection available, execute.p  pThe queue will be filled trough the flow of the application. For example filling in a questionary.p  pThe answers need to be synched to the server. Every question can include pictures takebn from the camera etc, so I want to save certain data as an object, put them in a queue, and have a thread handle the http requests. This way the UI wont be blocked. Its of great importance to sync whenever possible.p  pWhat I want to avoid is having another process run aside from my own APP. Thats why I havent used a service. Or do I missunderstand the concept of services as a wholep  pAre there specific queue objects or lists I want to loop trough the queue list that can be filled at anytime while the program is alive, with a thread.sleep like method when the list is completely empty.p  pPlease leave me hints and tips on what way to go with this.p

Negative 46220 pI am using a third party framework, which in rare cases does not respond anymore, if the internet connection is lost. My tests showed that when I am connected via WiFi on my home network and I start using the app and when the network changes from WiFi to the carrier network, the thread does not respond, if it was exchanging data at that very moment.  Of course I got in touch with the vendor of the framework to fix this, however, it will take some time, until I will get the patch.  In the meantime I would like to implement a workaround, so the user does not have to deal with a nonresponding app, especially as this is a nogo for the app approval. My question Is there a way I can monitor such a thread and terminate it after a timeout p  pOr would anyone have another solution approach for this issue I know about the reachability framework of Apple, but as far as I understand the framework, it is a detection tool only, which in my case would not solve my issue, right p  pThanks, Renp

To be specific, the dictionary would look something like N keys, with each value being a list of lists. The smaller inner list has 3 elementsp  precodedicscore key1[ [,,], [,,], [,,] ...[,,] ], key2[ [,,], [,,], [,,] ..[,,] ] ..keyN[[,,], [,,], [,,] ..[,,]] codepre  pThis dic is being generated from the following paradigm, a nested for loop.p  precodefor Gnodes in G.nodes        Gnodes iterates over 10000 values      Gvalue  someoperationGnodes     for Hnodes in H.nodes    Hnodes iterates over 10000 values          Hvalue someoperationHnodes         score  SomeOperation on Gvalue,Hvalue         dicscore.setdefaultGnodes,[].append[Hnodes, score, 1 ] codepre  pI then need to sort these lists, but the answer for that was given here,  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11221573howtooptimizethememoryandtimeusageofthefollowingalgorithminpython titleoptimizingoptimizinga use of generator expression in place of the inner loop is an optionbr [Note that the dic would contain 10000 keys with each key associated with a 10000 elements of smaller lists]p  pSince the loop counters are big, the dictionary generated is huge and I am running out of memory. p  pHow can I strongwritestrong the write the Keyvalue a list of lists as soon as it is generated to a file, so that I dont need to hold the entire dictionary in memory. I then want to be able to strongreadstrong back the dictionary in the same format i.e. something like dicscoreafterreading[key], returns me the list of list I am looking for.p  pI am hopping that doing this writing and reading per keyvalue would considerably ease the memory requirements. Is there a better data structure to do this Shall I be considering a database , probably like Buzhug, which would give me the flexibility to access and iterate over lists associated with each key  p  pI am currently using strongcPicklestrong to dump the entire dictionary and then reading it back via load, but cPickle crashes while dumping such a big data in one go. p  pApologies, but I am unaware of the best practices to do this type of stuff.

Negative 46220 pIm developing a website for a business. Its not a web application by any stretch of the imagination but I would like it to look ok on mobile devices rather than simply scale the desktop version. After lots of research into media queries and responsiveadaptive design approaches my requirements are that the mobile layout only kicks in when the user really is on a small screen and not just resizing their desktop window, the solution is simple and can be accomplished with media queries and minimal javascript.p  pThe approach Ive come up with is something like thisp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  var isRetina  window.devicePixelRatio gt 1  true  false var isMobile  screen.width lt 768  true  false  if isMobile ampamp isRetina      SHOW MOBILE LAYOUT AND HIRES IMAGES  else if isMobile ampamp isRetina      SHOW MOBILE LAYOUT AND LORES IMAGES  else if isMobile ampamp isRetina      ltltSHOW HIRES IMAGESgtgt  else if isMobile ampamp isRetina      SHOW DESKTOP LAYOUT AND LORES IMAGES  ltscriptgt codepre  pBefore I commit to this approach I figured Id check in and see if there is a problem or a terrible gotcha awaiting me. Or if theres an even simplerbetter way to achieve this goal. Ive searched a bunch on SO an havent seen any mention of using this exact same solution.p

I thought of just showing a emxem number of photos by default, and if the visitor click on a Show more or he is at the bottom of the page, then the script will show more photos.p  pI had a case like this befor but with a XML file, and I solve it. The problem is how can I do it with this emjsem file What are my choicesp
Negative 46220 pI know this makes none sense as many tutorials state that you can use SecondaryTable annotation, however it doesnt work in hibernate. I have schema like thisp  precodeEntity Tablenameserver SecondaryTablenamecluster, pkJoinColumns   PrimaryKeyJoinColumnname  uuid, referencedColumnName  clusteruuid  public class Server      Id     Columnname  uuid     private String uuid      Columnname  clusteruuid     private String clusterUuid        Columnname  ip, tablecluster       private String ip .....   Entity Tablename  cluster public class Cluster      Id     Columnname  uuid     private String uuid      Columnname  ip     private String ip  .....  codepre  pServer.clusterUuid is a foreign key to Cluster.uuid. strongI am hoping to get Server entity that fetches ip column from Cluster by joining Server.clusterUuid to Cluster.uuid.strongp  pThen I was greeted by a hibernate exceptionp  blockquote   pCaused by org.hibernate.AnnotationException SecondaryTable   JoinColumn cannot reference a non primary key       at org.hibernate.cfg.annotations.TableBinder.bindFkTableBinder.java402       at org.hibernate.cfg.annotations.EntityBinder.bindJoinToPersistentClassEntityBinder.java620       at org.hibernate.cfg.annotations.EntityBinder.createPrimaryColumnsToSecondaryTableEntityBinder.java612p blockquote  pI see lots of people encountered this problem. But the first bug for this in Hibernates bugzilla was 2010, I am surprised its been there for over two years as this is supposed to be a basic feature. There is some post saying JPA spec only allows primary key to do the mapping, however, I get below from JPA wikibookp  blockquote   pJPA allows multiple tables to be assigned to a single class. The   SecondaryTable and SecondaryTables annotations or    elements can be used. By default the Id columns are assumed to be   in both tables, such that the secondary tables Id columns are the   primary key of the table strongand a foreign key to the first tablestrong. If   the first tables Id columns are not named the same the   PrimaryKeyJoinColumn or  can be used to   define the foreign key join condition.p blockquote  pits obviously OK for nonprimary key. Then I am confused why Hibernate didnt fix this problem as it seems to be easy to implement by a join clause.p  panybody knows how to overcome this problem thank you.p

Negative 46220 pI have C VS 2010 project which uses Shell32.dll. Shell32.dll is used for creating zip file. The machine is Win7 64bit. The projects compile and runs fine when .net target version is 2.0 or 3.5. However changing it to 4.0 results in compilation failure.

Looking for reason amp resolution.p  pUpdate I tried creating new project and added reference to Shell32.dll. This time I refered the dll from CWindowsSysWOW64 insted of CWindowsSystem32. Now this time it compiled fine. But I am not sure if this project will run on 32bit windows and XP and other versions.p

Negative 46220 pIm trying to work with this camera SDK, and lets say the camera has this function called CameraGetImageDataBYTE data, which I assume takes in a byte array, modifies it with the image data, and then returns a status code based on successfailure.

Heres a code snippet on what I think worksp  precodeBYTE data  new BYTE[10000000]  an array of an arbitrary large size, Im not                                    sure what the exact size needs to be so I                                    made it large CameraGetImageDatadata  Do stuff here to processoutput image data codepre  pIve run the code w breakpoints in Visual Studio and can confirm that the CameraGetImageData function does indeed modify the array.

Negative 46220 pI have an apache http server A with modproxy enabled sending all requests to a second machine B.p  pIn a normal situation a request X will go to server A and then be sent to server B.

My first idea was to try ErrorDocument but nothing happened when I tried Probably due to proxy. My next idea was to use modrewrite however it seems the IF statement in Apaches conf file does not give me the option to look at the return code.p  pIs this even possible with Apache, maybe with a mod, or would I have to rely on a external application for that Id prefer to have total control of the returned answer so that not only the response status can be changed but the whole html itself, if possible.p  pAny suggestions are welcome.p

I have tried using p  pcodeTargetNullValueNot specifiedcode in the XAMLp  pandp  pcode[DisplayFormatNullDisplayText  Not specified]code on the metadata classp  pbut neither of these have worked.

I would like EF to create a table for each of the two classes, and the table for codeChildcode objects should simply have a foreign key column, ideally named ParentID, to keep the relation with the codeParentcode object. p  pI do not want a ChildID column in the Parent table, and I do not want to add an ID or ParentID property to the codeChildcode class.p  pCurrently, the properties of the codeChildcode object are created as columns in the Parent table, AND I get an exception if the XYZ property is not set to an instance of a codeChildcode class, i.e. it cant be null.  p  pIm trying to do this with the DbModelBuilder and the OnModelCreating event.

Negative 46220 pI got the jquery file upload plugin working on our site  a hrefhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploadwikiTemplateEngine relnofollowhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploadwikiTemplateEngineap  pHowever it uses a java script template language that was tied in with jquery at one time, but has been discontinued and removed from jquery.

The program is supposed to keep track of credit cards basically. My professor wants us to use doublylinked lists to accomplish this. The problem is, the book does not go into detail on the subject doesnt even show pseudo code involving doubly linked lists, it merely describes what a doubly linked list is and then talks with pictures and no code in a small paragraph. But anyway, Im done complaining. I understand perfectly well how to create a node class and how it works. The problem is how do I use the nodes to create the list Here is what I have so far.p  precodepublic class CardInfo   private String name private String cardVendor private String dateOpened private double lastBalance private int accountStatus  private final int MAXNAMELENGTH  25 private final int MAXVENDORLENGTH  15  CardInfo     CardInfoString n, String v, String d, double b, int s      setNamen     setCardVendorv     setDateOpenedd     setLastBalanceb     setAccountStatuss   public String  getName      return name   public String getCardVendor      return cardVendor   public String getDateOpened      return dateOpened   public double getLastBalance      return lastBalance   public int getAccountStatus      return accountStatus   public void setNameString n      if n.length gt MAXNAMELENGTH         throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionToo Many Characters     else          name  n              public void setCardVendorString v      if v.length gt MAXVENDORLENGTH         throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionToo Many Characters     else         cardVendor  v   public void setDateOpenedString d      dateOpened  d   public void setLastBalancedouble b      lastBalance  b   public void setAccountStatusint s      accountStatus  s   public String toString      return String.format25s     15s     s     s     s,             name, cardVendor, lastBalance, dateOpened, accountStatus   codepre  hr  precodepublic class CardInfoNode   CardInfo thisCard  CardInfoNode next CardInfoNode prev  CardInfoNode      public void setCardInfoCardInfo info        thisCard.setNameinfo.getName      thisCard.setCardVendorinfo.getCardVendor      thisCard.setLastBalanceinfo.getLastBalance      thisCard.setDateOpenedinfo.getDateOpened      thisCard.setAccountStatusinfo.getAccountStatus     public CardInfo getInfo        return thisCard      public void setNextCardInfoNode node        next  node     public void setPrevCardInfoNode node        prev  node     public CardInfoNode getNext        return next     public CardInfoNode getPrev        return prev    codepre  hr  precodepublic class CardList  CardInfoNode head CardInfoNode current CardInfoNode tail  CardList      head  current  tail  null    public void insertCardInfoCardInfo info      ifhead  null              head  new CardInfoNode         head.setCardInfoinfo         head.setNexttail         tail.setPrevnode  here lies the problem. tail must be set to something                                 to make it doublylinked. but tail is null since its                                 and end point of the list.           codepre  pHere is the assignment itself if it helps to clarify what is required and more importantly, the parts Im not understanding.

Negative 46220 pI recently created a Java program to stream MP3 audio using a servletOutputStream to the browser. I tested it on Firefox, chrome amp IE, and it worked fine until I updated Firefox to the newest version 15.0.1. At first I thought this was because this new version of FireFox included the new version of Flash but I checked Chrome and IE and they were both using the latest version of Flash as well. Does anyone know why the newest version of Firefox would cause audio streaming to stop working No error is thrown, it just wont play. Thanks for any help in advancep

Negative 46220 pA views delete button is pressed. The view belongs to a view controller, which handles the button press. However, that view controller is a child of a container view controller, so it sends its delegate a message that a deletion was requested, and includes the object that should be deleted.p  pThe delegate the parent view controller receives the notification and presents a codeUIActionSheetcode to confirm the deletion. It also makes itself the delegate of that action sheet.p  pThe user confirms the deletion, and parent view controller is ready to delete the object. Except it has to do this in codeactionSheetdidDismissWithButtonIndexcode. By that point, it no longer knows which object was passed down from the child view controller.p  pIs there a way to attach an object to the alert sheet so that when its dismiss action is fired, that object can be retrievedp
Negative 46220 pI was working with Scala Actors to try implementing some scheduler algorithm.p  pThe scheduler receives two functions which during their calculation call some interact function. For examplep  precodedef func1xInt, yIntschedulerMySchedulerInt      var z  0    if scheduler.interact1         return 7        z  x  y    for c lt 1 to 10         if scheduler.interactz             return z                z  z  c        z  codepre  pNow the scheduler needs to run both functions strongsequentiallystrong, and whenever an execution of a function reaches an interact, the scheduler decides whether to let the same function continue or pause it and wake up the other function calculation.p  pYou can think about it like running python generators, with a scheduler that decides which generators emnextem to call every time.p  pI implemented this using Scala Actors  each function is executed in an actor, and the codeinteractcode operation reply some value to the main thread the scheduler and calls receive to wait for a message from the main thread.p  pNotice that I cannot use react instead of receive, because I need the execution to break out from the receiveblock and return from the interact function.p  pThen I thought to improve the implementation by making my actors run always on the main thread using a hrefhttpwww.scalalang.orgapicurrentscalaactorsschedulerSingleThreadedScheduler.html relnofollowSingleThreadedSchedulera.p  pHowever, it seems that unlike react, the receive function try to create a new thread which blocks the execution.p  pIs there something between react and receive, in which the execution leave the block like in receive but avoid creating a new thread like in react Or maybe I could limit the number of threads to 1 in some other wayp  pAPosteriori I read about scala continuations, but this requires too many code changes and you would agree that scala continuations is a little bit complex to use....p  pThanksp

Negative 46220 pFrom a program developers perspective, combining PowerShell with Microsoft SQL Server 2012 LocalDB to interact with the SQL Server Database Engine is very appealing. Connecting to LocalDB instances from PowerShell, working with database objects and executing TransactSQL statements works just fine. This also holds true when adding the Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Shared Management Objects SMO to this mix.p  pWhat I cannot get to work is navigating through LocalDB instances by means of the PowerShell SQLPS module  Microsoft Windows PowerShell Extensions for Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Feature Pack. The latter tries obtaining SQL Server Service information whereas LocalDB does not create any database services.p  pWould there, nevertheless, be  a way to make LocalDB instances visible to the SQLPS modulep

Negative 46220 pIve got a problem I believe the solution is relatively simple but Im missing something. Basically the flow of my program from the user side is that I have a home screen of sorts where the on screen buttons are translucent and unresponsive until an item is selected from a drop down menu spinner widget.  On the code side, Ive defined the layout in an XML file and then just write all of the associated in Java. So in the onCreate method Ive initialized the buttons like sop  precodepublic void initButtons          Button buttonOne  Button findViewByIdR.id.buttonone         Button buttonTwo  Button findViewByIdR.id.buttontwo         Button buttonThree  Button findViewByIdR.id.buttonthree         Button buttonFour  Button findViewByIdR.id.buttonfour          buttonOne.setClickablefalse         buttonTwo.setClickablefalse         buttonThree.setClickablefalse         buttonFour.setClickablefalse          buttonOne.setAlpha0.5f         ButtonTwo.setAlpha0.5f         buttonThree.setAlpha0.5f         buttonFour.setAlpha0.5f      codepre  pThat works fine, but I want to set some onClickListeners AFTER an item has been selected from my spinner. So my activity class implements onItemClickListener and Ive got the following callbacks in my codep  precodeOverride public void onItemSelectedAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int position,         long id      if position  0          selectedTown  parent.getItemAtPositionposition.toString         CharSequence text  Youve Selected   selectedItem         int duration  Toast.LENGTHSHORT         Toast toast  Toast.makeTextSampleUI.this, text, duration         toast.show         itemSelected  true         handler.sendEmptyMessage1      else           itemSelected  false         Override public void onNothingSelectedAdapterViewltgt arg0    codepre  pThe boolean itemSelected is of global scope within the activity class, the Toast is for debugging purposes and not essential. But the problem i have is when I try to change the buttons after an item on the spinner below position 0 has been selected.

Negative 46220 pId like to open up a new chrome window not tab and have it take focus in its address bar immediately.  p  pIt works when pressing CTRLN to open the new window presumably from the current process but not when clicking the Icon in the quick launch bar or on the desktop thus launching a new process.br Then it just opens up, comes to the front, cursor blinking in the adress bar, but it does emnotem have focus there. Typing sends the input to desktop I believe since no open program seems to have the focus then. This is particularly annoying when I was working with a different program and want to have a new browser window.p  pMy Chrome version is 23.0.1271.97 on Windows 7 x64, and as far as I remember it worked fine until version 17.p

BindingExpression PathItems   DataItemMyItem  HashCode107597610 target element is   Microsoft.Phone.Controls.Pivot NameItems target property is   ItemsSource type System.Collections.IEnumerable.. codepre  pI thought that it was Conductor the class that implements Items list, but caliburn is trying to bind MyItem. Why is that I want to have a Pivot, which receives a list of MyItem in the bindable property Items, and displays them according to an ItemTemplate I defined. Do I need a ViewModel for this Ive read the documentation several times but I am still lost, could you please explain me whats happeningp

Negative 46220 pI guess this question is similar in topic to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1107262phpclimemoryusageoptimizationPHP cli Memory usage optimizationa, but that question was solved when the poster discovered a simple coding mistake.p  pI have a multithreaded PHP CLI application that runs continuously. I am trying to optimize the memory usage because the amount of memory used by each thread limits the number of threads that I can run at any given time since I have a finite amount of memory available. After some investigation, it seems that the MINIMUM amount of memory that each threaded process uses is around 1.3MB. Seems a bit high, but after some digging around it seems that PHP allocates memory in chunks of roughly 0.5MB. I doubt I can get my application lean enough to use less than 0.5MB, but Id like to try. Even cutting the footprint by 1020, if possible, would be great.p  pOne option Im considering is using APC to cache some data in memory. This seems counterintuitive as a technique for reducing memory, but currently Im making pretty frequent calls to a MySQL db to store and retrieve data. Here is a small examplep  precodeltphp function getstoredtoken     connectdb      queryresult  mysqlqueryselect token from tokens     if queryresult  true            queryresultarray  mysqlfetchrowqueryresult            token  queryresultarray[0]            unsetqueryresult, queryresultarray            return token          else             echo Problem with query to get stored tokenn       codepre  pIt seems there is a lot of memory overhead with using MySQL in such a way. This is confirmed by a call to codepmap d PID  grep mysqlcode, where especially codelibmysqlclientr.so.16.0.0code was using a lot of memory. So perhaps a simple technique to cache keyvalue pairs in memory would actually be lighter in terms of memory I dont have experience with this, however, so Id like to hear feedback on this idea before experimenting more with APC or some other caching technology. p  pAny other ideas on how to optimize memory usage in PHP would be most welcomedp

However in this case, it appears that the compiler does not see the operator template as a perfect match. And when both the codeboolcode and codeintcode overloading are present, then naturally it considers they are ambiguous.p  pIn summary, my question is that why the operator template is not considered a perfect match in this casep

Negative 46220 pIve been stuck on this particular part of my design and Id like some input as to how I should approach it. My program consists of courses codeLeerTrajectencode and elements codeElementencode. Both of these objects can exist independently, but elements can also be added to a course. codeElementcode in itself is an abstract superclass of objects like codeDocumentcode, codeCasuscode, etc.p  p1 When an element is added to a course, a courseelement codeLeerTrajectenElementcode is create which contains the codeTrajectCodecode, codeElementCodecode, an own unique code consisting of the previous two fields and some other data codeDisplayNaamcode, codeDisplayOmschrijvingcode.p  pIn the GUI Spring, there are a few tabs codeJTabbedPanecode dedicated to managing these courses and elements. Every tab has an overview and a detailpanel. In this overview theres a codeJTablecode to display every existing codeElementcode or codeTrajectcode.p  pThis is merely intended as a way to put the program into perspective codeLeerTrajectElementcode and to show that there might be multiple codeJTablecode active at the same time, but on different tabs. p  p2 Ive also got managers whose sole purpose is to manage their respective object codeLeerTrajectManagercode manages codeLeerTrajectcode, codeElementManagercode manages codeElementcode, etc. These managers are known to the codeDomeincontrollercode which serves as a general faade for the entire domain. Requests from the GUI are sent to this codeDomeinControllercode which sends the request, if its meant for a manager, to the correct one.p  pThats the basic outline of my program, Ill include some diagrams as visual aid.p  p1 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtHRT3.jpg altenter image description herep  p2img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPyp0U.jpg altenter image description herep  pI hope I have provided adequate information concerning the current setup of the project. For some reason my model isnt displaying correctly, but the codeDomeinControllercode holds the 3 managers it isnt shown in the overview but the associations are there.p  pAs you can see in picture 2, every manager holds a tableModel. TableModels are defined like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzzfGP.jpg altenter image description herep  pcodeMyAbstractTableModelcode extends codeAbstractTableModelcode and provides basic implementation so specific implementations can derive from this class while only providing the very basic needs. p  pThis is where were getting to the point Currently every manager holds its own tableModel and we the teacher decided we should abstract this out into a manager. Ive been working on an implementation for this, but I felt like I got something fundemental wrong these tableModels can be generated for a few different purposes either you want strongallstrong elements, or you want all elements stronglinked tostrong a course, or you want all elements linked to a strongspecificstrong course, etc etc.p  pIn order to obtain something like this, Ive tried creating two codegetTableModelcode methods. The first one only took an enum codeLEERTRAJECTcode, codeELEMENTcode, codeLEERTRAJECTELEMENTcode  as argument, while the second one took an additional codeListltEgtcode as argument. Doing this would allow me to generically add data to the request, data which could be gathered earlier by the appropriate manager and thus only sending resultset data to the codeTableModelManagercode.p  pThis approach ended up with a lot of codeSwitchcode statements for every method in my codeTableModelManagercode to determine what should happen with it and what tableModel should be used. The code became pretty unclean so I figured that this is probably not the way I want it to be.p  pAs to why we should introduce a manager in the first place appearantly our tableModels are now hard linked to our respective managers and we should try to avoid this.p  pSo, in conclusion I have several managers, all of them holding a codeTableModelcode to display their respective data.

Negative 46220 pHi everyone and thanks in advance for all your help. p  pIm currently working on a UI in matlab that includes 4 differents axes to show various info. Basicly, I have MRI data so 3D data that I want to show. I use 1 axe to show 3 perpendicular plane that split the data at its center axeMain, and 3 other axes that shows the planes individually axeX,axeY and axeZ. I have a main axe on wich I want to make rotations possible only on the main axis system and I want to be able to select coordinate on the 3 other axe those with 1 plane only. I also unable translations but that is out of scope for my problem. p  pSo basicly, I have no problem selecting my coordinates using the buttondownfcn on my planes on all of the 3 axes and I also have no problem using rotate3D on the mainAxe. HOWEVER, if I try to have both to work at the same time, the buttondownfcn doesnt work anymore. I dont understand why its doing this I have some ideas but thats about it and I have no idea how to work around it. Basicly my code for those functions are like this  p  precode    rotate3dhandles.axisMain             some other code, setting up other UI stuff      allow selection on the 3 static plains.     set[handles.axeX,handles.axeY,handles.axeZ], buttondownfcn, getCoord codepre  pSo my question is basicly  why wont those 2 functions dont work together and how to work around that problem, ideally with minimal code changep  pThanks.p  pEDIT  this is a print screen of my current interface. I want to be able to select coordinate using ONLY on the 3 last axes containing only 1 plane in each of them. I also want to be able to rotate images ONLY on the first axe the one with 3 planes. Hope this clarify. p  pimg srchttpi46.tinypic.comab789j.png altUIp  pI would also like to note this  following my tests, I found that the mouse click would not raise at all if the rotate3D is activated. The problem is not in the logic I use to get the coordinates itself, but in the click event not being fired.p  pAlso, I am aware that the event is not on the surface that I try to print. The actual code is like this  p  precode    seth, buttondownfcn, getCoord     seth,HitTest,on codepre  pwhere h is the handle of a surface and each surfaces are processed this way.p

Negative 46220 pI am developing with HSQLDB 2.2.9.  HSQLDB is one of the RDBMSs out there that supports the SQL Array type and I want to use this capability to address some functionality in my database.p  pIve been running some command line queries as I develop my database, but I am not sure how the UNIQUE constraint is handled by HSQLDB when declared for a column of type VARCHAR24 ARRAY[].  The DDL I am using followsp  precodeCREATE CACHED TABLE Clients       cliid       INTEGER              GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,     mrn          VARCHAR24 ARRAY    DEFAULT ARRAY[] NOT NULL UNIQUE,     lastname     VARCHAR48          NOT NULL,     firstname    VARCHAR24          NOT NULL,     dob          INTEGER              DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL  codepre  pThe mrn column contains an identifier that is unique for each client.  As Ive developed this database, Ive learned that a client may have one or more than one mrns.  One solution to this problem is to use the mrn column to store an array of mrns for each client. p  pWhat are the semantics of UNIQUE in this circumstance  Does HSQLDB assert that each element in the array satisfies the UNIQUE column constraintp  pThis answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8016776canpostgresqlhaveauniquenessconstraintonarrayelementsCan PostgreSQL have a uniqueness constraint on array elementsa suggests that Postgres 9.1 is unable to enforce the UNIQUE column constraint on SQL Array type elements.  I wonder if this may be the case for HSQLDB as well.p

Negative 46220 pFirst off there seems to be no way to get an exact match using a fulltext search. This seems to be a highly discussed issue when using the fulltext search method and there are lots of different solutions to achieve the desired result, however most seem very inefficient. Being Im forced to use fulltext search due to the volume of my database I recently had to implement one of these solutions to get more accurate results.p  pI could not use the ranking results from the fulltext search because of how it works. For instance if you searched for a movie called codeToy Storycode and there was also a movie called codeThe Story Behind Toy Storycode that would come up instead of the exact match because it found the word codeStorycode twice and codeToycode.p  pI do track my own rankings which I call Popularity each time a user access a record the number goes up. I use this datapoint to weight my results to help determine what the user might be looking for.p  pI also have the issue where sometimes need to fall back to a LIKE search and not return an exact match. I.e. searching codeGooniescode should return codeThe Gooniescode most popular resultp  pSo here is an example of my current stored procedure for achieving thisp  precodeDECLARE Title varchar255 SET Title  Toy Story need to remove quotes from parameter for LIKE search DECLARE Title2 varchar255 SET Title2  REPLACEtitle, ,   get top 100 results using fulltext search and sort them by popularity SELECT TOP100 id, title, popularity As Weight into TempTable FROM movies WHERE CONTAINStitle, Title ORDER BY [Weight] DESC  check if exact match can be found IF EXISTSselect  from TempTable where Title  title2 return exact match SELECT TOP1  from TempTable where Title  title2 ELSE no exact match found, try using like with wildcards SELECT TOP1  from TempTable where Title like   title2   DROP TABLE TEMPTABLE codepre  pThis stored procedure is executed about 5,000 times a minute, and crazy enough its not bringing my server to its knees. But I really want to know if there was a more efficient approach to this Thanks.p

Negative 46220 pSo Im a bit confused about something. I created a function in C to calculate some values and store them in a matrix file. This matrix file opens in notepad and contains rows and columns of float values. Anyway, I have seen matrices being displayed as some form of grey scale pixellike image and was wondering if I can do that in Matlab I have done research but nowhere seems to actually explain what they are. Im not really a pro in Matlab as I only did it for a few weeks in one semester but good enough to understand it. Well my question is, does anyone follow what I mean by converting a matrix to a grey scale pixellike image and if so, how would one implement that in Matlabp

Negative 46220 pI was playing up with malloced memory and local variables to see how stack and Heap grows. From my understanding heap grows upwards and the stack grows downwards. All the memory allocated using malloc is allocated in the heap and local variables are allocated on the stack in a function. p  pIn following program p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt define SIZE 999999999 void tot     static int c 0     int k     c     int pp  mallocsizeofint  SIZE     ifppNULL         fprintfstderr,NO memory allocated after call  dn,c         return              printfp d pn,ampk,c,pp         tot   int mainint argc, char argv[]     int k     int pp  mallocsizeofint  99999     ifpp NULL         fprintfstderr,No memory allocatedn         return              printfp pn,ampk,pp         tot         return 0  codepre  pI have created one local variable in the function tot which will be 4 bytes and one pointer variable of type int which will increase the total stack size for each call to slightly greater than 4 bytes. Also I have allocated some memory using malloc and assigned the allocated memory to local pointer variable. Since this malloced memory is allocated on the heap, the stack size should still be just over 4 bytes but according to my observation in the above program, the stack size is increased by a large amount. After some maths on that large amount I found out that the stack frame is including the malloced memory created in each function call.p  pThough removing the linep  precodeint pp  intmallocsizeofint  SIZE codepre  pwhich is responsible for allocating this large memory in each function call reduces the stack frame size back to 4 bytes which is perfectly fine.p  pStack frame is growing downwards in both situations though.p  pWhy I am getting such output. Is my belief that dynamic memory is allocated on the heap is wrong. Why malloced memory is increasing the size of the stack frame p  pEDIT   I also tried accessing the allocated memory in one stack frame in other stack frame by passing the pointer to memory allocated in one stack frame to the other function call another stack frame so that the memory allocated in one frame can be used in other call  just to verify if the compiler is not internally converting the malloc to alloca which could have been the reason for large stack frames but that didnt make any difference. The results are still same.p

Should Aggregate Roots that dont need direct access be retrieved and saved via repositories of those Aggregate Roots that do need direct accessp  pFor example, if we have codeCustomercode and codeOrdercode Aggregate roots and if for whatever reason we dont need direct access to codeOrdercode AR, then I assume only way emordersem can be obtained is by traversing codeCustomer.Orderscode propertyp  p2.

Should codeICustomerRepositorycode itself retrieve emordersem or should it delegate this responsibility to a codeIOrderRepositorycode If the latter, then one option would be to inject codeIOrderRepositorycode into codeICustomerRepositorycode.

Negative 46220 pI have a web app with HTML tables containing input boxes everywhere in it.  I want to be able to add rows to these tables from the C side of things.  To accomplish this, I use an asp button that calls this methodp  precodeprivate void AddRow      HtmlTableRow tRow  new HtmlTableRow      HtmlTableCell cell  new HtmlTableCell     HtmlTableCell cell2  new HtmlTableCell     HtmlTableCell cell3  new HtmlTableCell     HtmlTableCell cell4  new HtmlTableCell      cell.InnerHtml  ltinput typetext size29gt     tRow.Cells.Addcell      cell2.InnerHtml  ltinput typetext size9 classunits commas gt     cell2.Attributes.Addclass, leftBorder textCenter     tRow.Cells.Addcell2      cell3.InnerHtml  ltinput typetext size8 classvalue commas gt     cell3.Attributes.Addclass, leftBorder textCenter     tRow.Cells.Addcell3      cell4.InnerHtml  ltinput typetext size11 readonlyreadonly tabindex1 classtotalA1 autoTotal gtampnbsp     cell4.Attributes.Addclass, leftBorder rightBorder textRight     tRow.Cells.Addcell4      someTable.Rows.AddtRow  codepre  pThis works beautifully...for exactly one row.  I can click the button, it adds a row.  If I click it again, it doesnt do anything.  More specifically, I suspect its removing the currently added row, restoring the document to the default state, and then adds a row effectively doing nothing.p  pAssuming Im right, I need to somehow be able to append a row to another dynamically created row, instead of just replace it.  If Im not right, I just need a means to be able to continually add rows on a button press.p  pHow would I go about doing thisp  pEDIT  I should specify, all this could be done in a loop, all at once.  I was hoping to get it to work on a button press just for the sake of testing, but it can all be neatly tucked into a loop of some kind.  Ive had some success dropping it in one.p

Negative 46220 pIm having troubles in my GWT app with a Google Visualization chart not showing up until after the user has some sort of interaction with the window e.g. moves the mouse across the screen or presses a button. This would be fine except that the chart is suppose to show up as the first thing the user sees and since its meant to be seen on a mobile device, its likely they will not see the chart because their first interaction will be clicking a button that hides the chart to show other information.p  pUsing the a hrefhttpscode.google.compgwtgoogleapiswikiVisualizationGettingStartedASimpleInteractiveChart relnofollowGetting started tutoriala over at the Visualization codes page, the chart loads immediately fine once some slight changes are made the fix the problems from the slightly out of date tutorial. After some trial and error to find where the difference between my code and the example code that was causing the problem, I found that its happening because my code is using the newer layout panels instead of just regular panels in GWT.p  pThe below code is the working tutorial code changed so that it uses a RootLayoutPanel.get instead of a RootPanel.get. With this, the chart doesnt load until you click to reload the page, then you can see the chart for an instant before the page reloads. This should be easily tested with the below code. To get the chart to show up for the entire time, simply change RootLayoutPanel.get to RootPanel.get.p  pSomething in my app is allowing the chart to load after user interaction Im not sure what. However, the layout panel is certainly the problem as if I change it to a regular panel it works fine. Unfortunately, my entire app is built using layout panels.p  pWhats going on and how might I be able to make the chart show up from the start using layout panels Thank you muchp  precodepackage com.test.client  import com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint import com.google.gwt.core.client.JsArray import com.google.gwt.user.client.Window import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Panel import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.LayoutPanel import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.RootLayoutPanel import com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.RootPanel import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.AbstractDataTable import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.VisualizationUtils import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.DataTable import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.Selection import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.AbstractDataTable.ColumnType import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.events.SelectHandler import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.visualizations.corechart.PieChart import com.google.gwt.visualization.client.visualizations.corechart.Options  public class SimpleViz implements EntryPoint    public void onModuleLoad       Create a callback to be called when the visualization API      has been loaded.

I tried other variants like the one in the first commented section by attaching that event handler to the Open event, but the result was the same codewaitHandle.Setcode  never executes and the value of the waitHandle is always false. The only option that I managed to get working is the the solution from the second commented section blocking the thread with Thread.Sleep until the file is completely loaded the file is loaded for example when the TimeSpan is initialised ... which is time lost and performance decrease for my application. The problem is obviously not with the event itself, because the event triggers if its run on the main thread the method AddMediaFilesToMediaList is called from a BackgroundWorker Thread that launches the method inside a new thread when it detects that there are elements in the Queue the AddMediaFilesToMediaList thread is created with codenew Threadcode  and obviously the file is loading because the TimeSpan is initialized. I really want to make the application work using the waitHandle or something like that. I dont want to use the Thread.Sleep because its ugly and my application also has a memory leak when I try to load a lot of files i takes over 1.2 GB of memory and the it stops with errors OutOfMemory  I tried to load 2048 songs in it and I believe that it could be because of the Thread.Sleep. Even if it isnt, it will be much more easy to debug without the problem of the Thread.Sleep.p  pSo how can I make the waitHandle to work  How can I make the codewaitHandle.Setcode to run  And if anyone has any idea about where that that excessive memory usage could come from, it would be great  I personally believe that its the fault of Thread.Sleep but I dont know how to get rid of it. p  pEdit  The reason I use an MediaFileCreator object is that initially I wanted to use a thread pool of 2 to 4 threads to process the media files, but I had the same problem so I removed the ThreadPool and I tried with the code posted above, but the same problem occurred.p  pEdit  I managed to get it working using a second thread to wait for the event not the cleanest code right now, but Ill make it right. p  precodepublic class MediaFileCreator       private AutoResetEvent openedEvent  new AutoResetEventfalse       public MediaFile CreateNewMediaFilestring filename               var mFile  new MediaFilefilename         var thread  new ThreadWaitForEvent         const int maxTimeToWait  2000         openedEvent.Reset         thread.StartmFile          var mediaPlayer  new MediaPlayer          mediaPlayer.Opennew UrimFile.PathToFile          openedEvent.WaitOnemaxTimeToWait          var fromThread  Dispatcher.FromThreadThread.CurrentThread         if fromThread  null fromThread.InvokeShutdown          return mFile            private void WaitForEventobject context               var mFile  MediaFilecontext         var mediaPlayer  new MediaPlayer          mediaPlayer.MediaOpened              delegate                              if mediaPlayer.NaturalDuration.HasTimeSpan                     mFile.TimeSpanOfMediaFile  mediaPlayer.NaturalDuration.TimeSpan                 mFile.HasAudio  mediaPlayer.HasAudio                 mFile.HasVideo  mediaPlayer.HasVideo                 mFile.Success  true                 mediaPlayer.Close                 openedEvent.Set                       mediaPlayer.MediaFailed              delegate                              mFile.Failure  true                 mediaPlayer.Close                 openedEvent.Set                       mediaPlayer.Opennew UrimFile.PathToFile          Dispatcher.Run       codepre

Negative 46220 pI just recently starting using Azure Mobile Services. I am in the process of setting up my database. However I am not sure how I am going to handle one to manymany to many relationships. Azure Mobile has not out of the box support for this so I am not sure what else to do. One approach would be to just store the foreign key id in a particular entity and then run a query on that table to get all items that match a particular id. I think that might be a bit too time consuming. Not sure. Any suggestions or insights on how this can be done.  Would I have to resort to creating some form of logic on the backend with JavaScript to create the actual relationships on the server sidep

This first one is to the general site DBp  precode    hostnamesiteadmin  localhost     databasesiteadmin  generalsiteDB     usernamesiteadmin  generalsiteUSER     passwordsiteadmin  generalsitePWD     siteadmin  mysqlpconnecthostnamesiteadmin, usernamesiteadmin, passwordsiteadmin or triggererrormysqlerror,EUSERERROR  codepre  pThe second one is to the external user DBp  precode    hostnamevusradmin  localhost     databasevusradmin  extusersiteDB     usernamevusradmin  extusersiteUSER     passwordvusradmin  extusersitePWD     vusradmin  mysqlpconnecthostnamevusradmin, usernamevusradmin, passwordvusradmin or triggererrormysqlerror,EUSERERROR codepre  pAs I said, on my testing server this works with no problems, but on the production server only the connection script which is strongloaded laststrong works. This would seem to indicate a variable conflict, but again, the variables are different for each connection script as shown above. My error handling script returns this error when attempting to view the registered usersp  precodemysqlnumrows supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource codepre  pIt points to line 33 which is the last line in this mysql queryp  precodemysqlselectdbdatabasevusradmin, vusradmin query  SELECT userid FROM extusers result  mysqlqueryquery totalrecords  mysqlnumrowsresult codepre  pWhen I view the output of my error handling script I see two different connection variables each of which has been assigned a Resource id. I also see the username and password for each connection, and they are both correct. The error on line 33 seems to indicate that the query is not producing anything, which is borne out by the error message contentp  precode[query] gt SELECT userid FROM extusers [result] gt  codepre  pthe result is empty.p  pTo sum up, this works perfectly on my development server, but not on my production server.  The error report shows both connections being made, each having a correct username and password.  A separate Resource id has been assigned to each connection, but the first DB interaction with extusers, the Select query, fails. I have checked, doublechecked, and triple checked the values of the connection script with those on the live server, and they are all correct. I have a DB user vuseradm with Select, Insert, Update, and Delete privileges on the live server.  What could this be  Is there a server setting that might be affecting thisp  pAny helpful suggestions would be most welcome.p  pstrongResolvedstrongp  pI recreated both the connection script and the mysqlselectdb and query, and now it is working just fine. I still dont see where the difference is between the original and the new version, but hey, who cares, its working fine now.p  pSorry for troubling everyone with this trivial, yet frustrating matter. Many thanks to all who replied.p

I would like to pick your brains on this matter.p  pWe have an existing website developed using Moodle. The website is technically a Learning Management System that grades users after each course. Now we want to make it more interactive by adding a game element to it. We will develop a tab that will redirect the users to Joomla website which will look exactly like the moodle one but they wont know they are on a different platform. This tab will display the users profile including his grade or at least the numerical value of his Grades which will be labeled as Points. I know the numerical value of the users Grades are stored somewhere in Moodle but is it possible for that value to be a reference of the Users points in the Joomla platform p

Either that, or its just a hardcoded warning specifically for this class.p  pSecondly, it doesnt seem like good practice to just assume that the result will never be null.

Negative 46220 pI used to have some code in C which stores strings as a series of characters in a character matrix a string is a row. The classes Character matrix and LogicalVector are provided by Rcpp.hp  precodeLogicalVector unqmat CharacterMatrix x    int nc  x.ncol   Get the number of columns in the matrix.    LogicalVector outnc  Make a logical bool vector of the same length.    For every col in the matrix, assess whether the column contains more than one unique character.   for int i0 i lt nc i       out[i]  unique x,i .size  1         return out  codepre  pThe logical vector identifies which columns contain more than one unique character. This is then passed back to the R language and used to manipulate a matrix. This is a very R way of thinking of doing this. However Im interested in developing my thinking in C, Id like to write something that achieves the above So finds out which characters in n strings are not all the same, but preferably using the stl classes like stdstring. As a conceptual example given three strings A  Hello, B  Heleo, C  Hidey. The code would point out that positionscharacters 2,3,4,5 are not one value, but positioncharacter 1 the H is the same in all strings i.e. there is only  one unique value. I have something below that I thought workedp  precodestdvectorltintgt StringsComparestdvectorltstringgtamp stringVector      stdvectorltintgt informative     for int i  0 i lt stringVector[0].size1 i          for int n  1 n lt stringVector.size1 n              if stringVector[n][i]  stringVector[n1][i]                  informative.pushbacki                 break                                return informative  codepre  pIts supposed to go through every character position 0 to size of string1 with the outer loop, and with the inner loop, see if the character in string n is not the same as the character in string n1. In cases where the character is all the same, for example the H in my hello example above, this will never be true. For cases where the characters in the strings are different the inter loops if statement will be satisfied, the character position recorded, and the inner loop broken out of. I then get a vector out containing the indicies of the characters in the n strings where the characters are not all identical. However these two functions give me different answers. How else can I go through n strings char by char and check they are not all identicalp  pThanks, Ben.p

Negative 46220 pI have a pretty basic push notification question I was hoping someone could quickly answer for mep  pI am developing an application for another person and everything is completed except for push notification integration. The other person logged into his developer account, created an App ID lets say com.company.myApp, configured it for push notification and created a development and production SSL Push certificate.p  pUp to this point, I have been using MY personal developer account, and my question is 2 foldp  p1 If I create an App ID that matches the one my customer made com.company.myApp and test it in development, will the push notification trigger in my app I am guessing not since I assume there must be some tie to the other persons account within these certificates.p  p2 In general, is it possible to develop an application with a developer license A, and have it submit to iTunes Connect belonging to the owner of license B p  pIn essence, I am trying to figure out if I need to obtain this other persons developer license certificates in order to fully create an app for them or if I can develop on my certificates and simply log into their iTunes Connect and upload the app even though the app was code signed by my certificate. Developing applications for other people is a new realm for me and so how all these licensescertificates come into effect is a tad confusing.p  pI hope this scenario makes sense, if not I can try to further clarify.p

Negative 46220 pI am currently working on an online shop with WooCommerce. I faced the problem that I want to grant a discount to customers who chose a specific shipping method.

In other words it is always one step back and therefore displays the customer the wrong total amount.p  pDoes anyone has an idea to solve this problemp

Negative 46220 pI have the following scenario An application Im working on includes a library lets call it static library 1. Static library 1 includes among other functionality I must have Google analytics , Facebook and Flurry in old versions. In that app I intend to use a SDK Im developing which also uses Google analytics , facebook and flurry.p  pTheoretically  I have no problems compiling a slim version of my SDK that will take those implementation from the static library 1  Assuming we both use the same version of facebook and flurry. Ive done so in the past and it worksp  pBut since the library is old the version of the facebook and flurry sdks is older and I cannot use it. Is there anyway to strip those symbols or to override them I dont mind putting all the libraries at the project level or any other solution of that type.p  pThanks in advance,p  pLiviup

Negative 46220 pGah  We use TFS at work but my manager doesnt want to use its branching feature to manage a large automated modification change that affects 200300 files.  Each file has to be viewed to confirm that the mod was legit.  So instead, we are using TFSs shelving feature, where other developers will pull down the shelfset, merge with the trunk and confirm that the changes are legit.  And then every so often I merge the trunk back into the shelfset.  Sounds convoluted  IMHO, youd be right.  Although I think in this way, changes on the same line in a file on the trunk and on the shelfset would cause a conflict which if Im not mistaken would not happen on a branch if I were to merge the trunk to the branch resulting in backing out my changes on the trunk Im actually not sure how this would be resolved, so any info on this would be useful.p  pSo, in order to see and manage my changes in the shelfset and see what got merged in, I resorted to having a local git repository.  It works well, but I find MSVS2013 defaults to git as the managing repository, keeping me from connecting with the tfs repository.p  pIs there a way to get MSVS2013 to play nice  I cant even get it to jump back to the TFS by telling it to use TFS database.   It would be optimal if I could switch back and forth between both, but even if I could just lock it down to TFS that would help a lot and I would then just use gits command line interface.p  pstrongEDITstrong I have a workaround where I change the em.gitem directory to something else, load the solution and then rename the directory back to em.gitem.  Is there another way to lock MSVS to use TFS more permanentlyp

Negative 46220 pI have an XBAP WPF application. Up until a few days ago, whenever I would stop debugging, internet explorer would realize that debugging had stopped and would close automatically. But for some reason when I stop debugging or the application errors and terminates Internet Explorer stays open. The frame clears out and is just white, not showing anything from my application, but the tab stays open.p  pI wish I could be more specific, or had any relevant code to show, but I dont know what could be causing it. Any clues as to what could be causing this My best guess is theres something thats not getting disposed properly in my application thats not telling IE that the application has terminated, but since it happens after the debugger has already stopped, its hard to track down.p

Negative 46220 pWe are adding a loading dialog as a fragment as a temporary view within a container to show the user while data from the server is processed before showing the main view. We want to be able to show this dialog inside a panel such as a frame layout because the particular view we are using is a custom container fragment to emulate the iOS SplitViewController. Potentially, when loaded on a tablet, there could be 2 of these loading fragments showing at the same time in their respective containers.p  pThe fragment we are using inherits from DialogFragment and all the other fragments are basically heavily customised list fragments.p  pThe problem we are facing is, when we add the temporary fragment to the container directly using the Fragments childFragmentManager.Replace method, it completely messes up the back navigation. When it is used as a modal dialog calling dialog.show the back navigation is fine, but the dialog doesnt show in the frame we want it to.p  pIs there a way to either a. fix the back nav problem or b.make the dialog show in the specified frame when calling dialog.Showp  pHere is the code for the dialog fragmentp  precodepublic class TestLoadingFragment  DialogFragment      public override void OnCreate Bundle savedInstanceState              base.OnCreate savedInstanceState         this.Cancelable  false         this.HasOptionsMenu  false         this.SetStyleStyleNoTitle, 0           public override View OnCreateView LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState              return inflater.InflateResource.Layout.TestLoadingFragmentLayout, container, false       codepre  pcodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidminWidth200dip     androidminHeight200dipgt     ltRelativeLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt         ltProgressBar             styleandroidattrprogressBarStyleLarge             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididloadingViewProgress             androidlayoutcenterInParenttrue gt         ltTextView             androidtextLoading Please Wait             androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceMedium             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididlblViewLoadingText             androidgravitycenter             androidlayoutbelowidloadingViewProgress             androidtextColorff000000 gt     ltRelativeLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgtcodep  pAny Help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 46220 pI have been trying to develop a small java application. Im using JavaFX for the GUI. Im using eclipse with the a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgefxclipseindex.html relnofollowefxclipsea plugin. Everything worked fine. I was using jdk1.7.060 as me default JRE in eclipse. I decided I wanted to try and export to a runnable .jar file so I could test my application without eclipse. This is where it went wrong.p  pA while ago I installed jre8 and jdk1.8.005 on my system, for testing purposes. At first I didnt understand why my application kept giving runtime errorsExceptions while running the application, but that is because my default java is 8 now.p  pI changed my jdk in eclipse from 1.7 to 1.8 and the same errorsexceptions were given in eclipse, so Im pretty sure it has something to do with the jave8 Im running. combination between the two maybep  pIt is my first time using JavaFX so it may just be a configuration error.p  pIve tried changing my code as explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23335419codeisworkinginjdk7notinjdk8herea but it still does not work.

Negative 46220 pMy understanding of the parse.com API rate limit is that its not a concurrentjob limit, its just the number of requests started in a given second.

Negative 46220 pFirst off, the fiddle to my question is here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpfifasaTh7F relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpfifasaTh7Fap  h1The problemh1  pI want to display the sum of the values of all series at each point on the horizontal axis as stack labels above each stack. Because I have negative stacks and I do not want to display positive and negative totals above and beneath separately, I set up a formatter function manually lines 42 through 50 in the fiddle. The stack labels that I want should be the sum over strongallstrong values at a given point, i.e. the sum of the positive stacks minus the sum of all negative stacks. E.g. if the data series at the first point is p  precodedata [1,2,3,4] codepre  pI would like the stack label to display a 6 above the stacked bar. My formatter function works fine with data series of the sortp  precodedata [1,2,3,4] codepre  pBut once I add a date variable to each series likep  precodedata [ [Date.UTC2010, 0, 1, 4], [Date.UTC2010, 3, 1, 15], [Date.UTC2010, 6, 1, 17], [Date.UTC2010, 9, 1, 10] ] codepre  pthe stack labels are not displayed anymore.

Fixing one error by requiring a file that StackOverflow recommends exposes another error. Id like to create one wiki of the right way to set up Capybara  RSpec with Rails.p  pGemfilep  precodesource httpsrubygems.org ruby 2.1.2  gem rails, 4.1.0  group development, test do   gem sqlite3, 1.3.8   gem rspecrails, gt 3.0.0 end  group test do   gem seleniumwebdriver, gt2.35.1   gem capybara, gt2.4.1 end  gem sassrails, 4.0.1 gem uglifier, 2.1.1 gem coffeerails, 4.0.1 gem jqueryrails, 3.0.4 gem turbolinks, 1.1.1 gem jbuilder, 1.0.2  group doc do   gem sdoc, 0.3.20, require false end  group production do   gem pg, 0.15.1   gem rails12factor, 0.0.2 end codepre  pspecspechelper.rbp  precoderequire activesupport require railsall  require rspecrails require rspecautorun    This file was generated by the rails generate rspecinstall command. Conventionally, all  specs live under a spec directory, which RSpec adds to the LOADPATH.  The generated .rspec file contains require spechelper which will cause this  file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any files.   Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as  lightweight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file  will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an  individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, make a  separate helper file that requires this one and then use it only in the specs  that actually need it.   The .rspec file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that  users commonly want.   See httprubydoc.infogemsrspeccoreRSpecCoreConfiguration RSpec.configure do config  The settings below are suggested to provide a good initial experience  with RSpec, but feel free to customize to your hearts content. begin    These two settings work together to allow you to limit a spec run    to individual examples or groups you care about by tagging them with    focus metadata. When nothing is tagged with focus, all examples    get run.   config.filterrun focus   config.runallwheneverythingfiltered  true     Many RSpec users commonly either run the entire suite or an individual    file, and its useful to allow more verbose output when running an    individual spec file.   if config.filestorun.one      Use the documentation formatter for detailed output,      unless a formatter has already been configured      e.g. via a commandline flag.     config.defaultformatter  doc   end     Print the 10 slowest examples and example groups at the    end of the spec run, to help surface which specs are running    particularly slow.   config.profileexamples  10     Run specs in random order to surface order dependencies. If you find an    order dependency and want to debug it, you can fix the order by providing    the seed, which is printed after each run.        seed 1234   config.order  random     Seed global randomization in this process using the seed CLI option.    Setting this allows you to use seed to deterministically reproduce    test failures related to randomization by passing the same seed value    as the one that triggered the failure.

Are there any special considerations I need to take to swap themp  pIve thought about just changing the visibility on the ViewPager, but I am not sure if this is a bad idea.p  pI am having a lot of difficulty searching this topic because almost every post is about hiding a fragment bwithinb a codeViewPagercode, and not hiding the codeViewPagercode itself.  Any links or tips are appreciatedp
Negative 46220 pIm just practicing some things in PHP and have come across a problem. p  pI am linking multiple pages to single index.php page using PHP Include function  as i have read it makes a large site much more manageable and easily updateable. p  pI have created external CSS files 3 in total, one for the navigation, page styling and wrapper content and have a few external JS files which have all been linked to a PHP document named head.php. below is the head.php contentsp  pThe main page which the server will show first will be index.php so for this page i am linking all the other segments which will all fit together to create the single page. below is the index.php contentsp  pMy problem is that inbetween both the head and footer php include lines i have created a div named wrapper styles are already applied to an external CSS sheet named style.css which is linked in head.php please see bottom for style.css contents I would presume that when i view index.php in my browser i am using XAMPP that is should show the wrapper on the page, however i can not see the wrapper and i just continue to see the navigation bar only, i find this strange as i can use codelth1gtcode and codeltpgtcode tags in index.php which are externally styled by the php included head.php page.p  pPlease take a look at my code below for all the pages mentioned, Im not sure what i am doing wrong here.

Negative 46220 pWhen using posix threads, is there some way to protect the main thread from errors such as dereferenced null pointers, division by zero, etc caused by worker threads.

Negative 46220 pMorning all,p  pSo I have a strange issue with Outlook.com, former hotmail.com...p  pI am working on a project to supply businesses with micro servers raspberry pi which I have setup as apache servers, and installed an HTMLPHPBASH program that allows the user to create html email campaigns and send them to groups of contacts. The programhardware works perfectly.p  pExceptp  pEmails received by outlook clients do not receive the images just placeholders. p  pI have figured out though testing that the images are blocked because the srcnonfqdn  in other words, I am using the IP of the client without registering a domain  because that is over complicated and they are NOT hosting a website. So there should be no reason for an fqdn. p  pIf this problem can be solved, dont read furtherp  pBTW Every other MUA renders the images perfectly p  pSo I am re thinking a way around this, and figured I would host the images on my own domain, however the clients raspberry pis will need to be able to upload the images on a server within my domain, so for security reasons, I have setup a standalone headless server for just that purpose, and aligned it to port 8080. Problem solved right NOp  pOutlook still bloody blocks them. WHY p  pHere is an example to explain my problem.p  pConsider the following IMG codes which would be in the email htmlp  precodeEg. 1 ltimg srchttpfqdn.comimagesexample.jpg width30 aligncentergt  Eg. 2 ltimg srchttpfqdn.com8080imagesexample.jpg width30 aligncentergt  Eg. 3 ltimg srchttpIPimagesexample.jpg width30 aligncentergt codepre  pIn Eg.1 The image is rendered perfectly. In Eg.2 amp 3 The images are blocked. p  pNote fqdn in both 1 and 2 are the same. p  pPlease help me  Months of work about to be shit canned...p  pTimp

Negative 46220 pI am writing code for a single processor 32 bit microcontroller using gcc.p  pI need to consume timestamped objects from a linked list. Another part of the code which could be asynchronous maybe in an ISR adds them to the list.p  pThe critical section is implemented by turning interrupts off and using the codebarriercode function.p  pIm confused where gcc optimization could break my code by cacheing pointers to the list items next most recent item to remove, list head, or free list. I dont want anything inside the while loop to be cached from a previous time around the loop. Will the memory barrier protect me from the compiler deciding to load a pointer once at the start of the function and never reload it again All these list pointers might be modified in the critical section of the producer code not shown. I am trying to understand if codepqueuefirstcode should be a volatile pointer, for example.p  pPresumably, if there was no loop which is the case for adding to the list, I am ok if all the code in a function is in a critical sectionp  pPlease dont just point me to some generic article about volatile or critical sections because I have read a bunch of them, but I am having trouble seeing how to apply it to this specific code. I understand that volatile ensures that the compiler will reload the variable every time it is referenced.

Negative 46220 pI have seen similar questions saying that the direction to take java to xsd or xsd to java  depends on your focus, in other words are you looking to create the perfect schema or perfect java design. p  pHowever I am curious to know if the use cases are the really same. A colleague of mind commented, why would you want to go from java to xsd, if you do that you have already created an implementation. Which sort of does beg the question, why would you start with hand written java, convert to xsd, and then eventually convert to generated java. p  pTo try to ask it differently, does it really matter which route you take java to xsd or xsd to java , because in the end the artefact that you require is xsd, which can be converted adhoc to java when and if required.p

I store all Registration IDs in the database one for  each user. So if i for example havep  ul liDevice A of User Ali liDevice B of User Bli ul  pAnd User B is now logging in using Device A i have to update the Registration ID in my Database for User B and it will set to the Registration ID of the App on  Device A. So User A and B will temporally have the sam Registration ID until User B logs in on Device B again and i update my Database.p  pI hope you understood what i mean and can tell me if this is how i need to  do it to make sure that every user gets hisher push notifications even when he is logged in on another device.p  pWould it be also a good idea to delete the registration id from the database when the user is logging outp
Negative 46220 pId like users to be able to create widgets that each have their own state specifically, two ints that will most likely be unique to each widget. When widgets are clicked, the ints will be used to do something. I thought Id be able to do this by adding the data as extras to an intent and using the setOnClickPendingIntent method to give each widget a unique intent. However, it seems that this ends up giving each widget the same configuration as the initial widget.

Negative 46220 pSay we have a Windows application, which sends some packets over HTTPS. We need to extract the content of this packets unencrypted of course.p  pThere is no way to get hands on server private certificate and MitM attack doesnt work some MitM defense is used by this application. So, decryption seems to be off the table.p  pThe only choice I suppose is to extract these packets from the application embeforeem they get encrypted. Application is well protected, it has no dependency on OpenSSL DLLs. However, we have a certain feeling that it uses OpenSSL but, statically linked, may be OpenSSL source was even modified before compilinglinking.p  pHooking a call to OpenSSL functions like sslwrite is not simple, because the applications executable is packed and obfuscated. It also has a debugging protection, but a stealth debugger, which avoid this defense, is already found. So, we can debug this application. However, the code, as seen during debugging, is a complete mess obfuscated. Even the system DLLs, being loaded by this application, are completely messed. Here is an example of how the send function from WS232.dll looks like during debugging of this application a hrefhttps2.postimg.orgpjzaipx0pimage.png relnofollowhttps2.postimg.orgpjzaipx0pimage.pnga For reference, here is how it looks like from normal unprotected application a hrefhttps21.postimg.org3kzntkn93image.png relnofollowhttps21.postimg.org3kzntkn93image.pnga So, its very hard to understand how the function arguments are passed, moreover it looks like they can be passed via different ways not sure, but looks so according debugging experiments.p  pThis seems to be a quite common task, since there are many Windows applications which use HTTPS and statically linked OpenSSL.p  pHopefully somebody have such experience and can share it.p

Negative 46220 pI recently stumbled across the following in our application and Im curious to know whether this is good or bad practice. What I see is events being subscribed to on different levels in the application, business logic and ultimately our framework.p  pWe have functionality to authenticate and authorize users, which is orchestrated by an HttpModule which basically does the following I only included the most relevant partsp  precode    public class FooModule  IHttpModule              private IIdentityProvider identityProvider          public void InitHttpApplication context                      identityProvider  TypeFactory.CreateltIIdentityProvidergt...type string from configuration...             identityProvider.Initcontext, ...              context.PostAuthenticateRequest  OnAuthenticateRequest             context.PostAuthenticateRequest  OnAuthenticateRequestLogging                   ...      codepre  pSo far, so good the HttpModule identifies the configured identity provider, initializes it and subscribes to some events. The event handlers are not in question here, so I omitted them.p  pThen, in the initialization of an arbitrary identity providerp  precodepublic class BarIdentityProvider  IIdentityProvider      public void InitHttpApplication httpApplication, ...              var authorizer  new BarAuthorizationProvider         authorizer.InithttpApplication, ...          httpApplication.PostAuthenticateRequest  httpApplicationPostAuthenticateRequest         httpApplication.AuthorizeRequest  httpApplicationAuthorizeRequest           ...  codepre  pAnd in the AuthorizationRequestHandler the following happensp  precodepublic class BarAuthorizationProvider      public void InitHttpApplication httpApplication, ...              httpApplication.PostAuthorizeRequest  OnAuthorizeRequest           ...  codepre  pAs you can see, there are events being subscribed to in FooModule, BarIdentityProvider and BarAuthorizationProvider which, to me, comes across as event spaghetti. Also, when doing thisp  precodevar authorizer  new BarAuthorizationProvider authorizer.InithttpApplication, ... codepre  pI do not expect the codeauthorizercode to subscribe to various events and work magically.p  pAs a software developer I expect eitherp  ol lione HttpModule which subscribes to the necessary events and requests the identity provider and authorization provider for identity and access information. Event handling is minimized in the providers.li limultiple HttpModules i.e. an authentication and an authorization module which each subscribe to the necessary events.

Negative 46220 pWhen sending emails from Dynamics CRM, we want to send emails to only accounts and contacts.

The ToRecipient type specifies the recipient in the To field and you can select Account, Contact, Lead and User. On the same page, there is a Customer party type from where you can select only Account and Contact.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg328549.aspx relnofollow titleActivity Party entityActivity Party Entitya, the Customer party list is not available as a party list for the email entity.

Negative 46220 pWhen I remove tables used in my Azure database of course after removing the entities, I just use DROP TABLE TABLENAME. This has a bad effect. When I run the mobile service by just starting the browser, I get an Error 500 when I add a new record of an existing table of course with my TableControllers. Apparently, I did something wrong. It can be solved by creating a completely new database and use this one in my mobile service. The Seed method ensures that the right tables exist and only the right tables and everything works fine.p  pWhat is the best way to prevent errors when removing tables in a database used in Azure Mobile Services. Creating a completely new database seems to be a bit overdone and unneeded.p

Negative 46220 pI have built an MVC application using ASP.NET Identity 2.0. I have done so before many times and I have no problem registering users, setting passwords, etc. It is all done for me by the template.p  pHowever, my client has asked to be able to manage users themselves. I assumed this would be as easy as creating a controller and views for the AspNetUsers table in the database. Its not though. For starters I have to create a model before I can create a controller and view, but given that it is codefirst that makes no sense really. I tried creating a viewmodel so as the database wouldnt want to be updated, but then EF doesnt recognise the AspNetUsers as there is no model so it cant connect.p  pIf I sound confused it is because I am. Can anyone shed some light. All I want is a view showing all the users and allowing the admin to add or delete users of the application. I know there will be a few gotchas like setting passwords etc, but I can figure that out later.p  pI dont want to have to roll my own user table if I can avoid it.p

Negative 46220 pIn my Android app, I have enabled cookies and have verified that when I visit a site, the cookie is being stored.p  pBut when I navigate to a site like Reddit.com and then login, the login doesnt fail but the cookie is either not being stored or its not being forward to the server when the page reloads.p  pFrom my understanding, WebView is suppose to not only store the cookie but automatically foward it to the site when it navigates to the domain. It isnt clear how WebView handles a site like Reddit where the main page is http but the login is https.p  pNote I dont use loadUrl to navigate to this site. I initially load googles site, get reddit to show up in a search list and click on the link to take me to Reddits site. Still, the assumption I am making is that WebView automatically handles the saving and forwarding of the cookie.p

Negative 46220 pI am struggling to find a solution to a problem I need to solve, so I decided to ask instead of just looking at other questions that werent quite what I was looking for.p  pI am using mysql and have data like the followingp  precode id   date        1  20150605      1  20150607   1  20150608   2  20150604   2  20150606   3  20150603   3  20150608   4  20150602 codepre  pThe id represents a specific user in the database, and date represents the date that an event took place for that user. strongMy goal is calculate the average amount of time between one event taking place for a user and the next event for that same user, averaged over all users.strongp  pSo for example, using the example data I provided, for the id 1 user, I want to start with the first event for this user and find the gap of time between this event and the next event 20150607  20150605  2 days. Next is the gap of time between the second and third events 20150608  20150607  1 day. As we proceed down the list, we add together the days and track how many spaces of time weve calculated, so that we can take an average at the end. After user 1, we have 3 days total and 2 spaces added.p  pFor id 2 user, we get 2 days 20150606  20150604  2, so 5 days total and 3 spaces added. After id 3 user, we have 10 days total with 4 spaces 20150608  20150603  5. For id 4 user, there is only one event, so we dont have any spaces added, so we stay at 10 days total with 4 spaces IDs with only one event are essentially ignored. So our answer is 104  2.5 as the average for this particular small set of data.p  pbrp  pI need to be able to calculate this result with data in which before running the code, I do not know the number of distinct ids or the number of events for each of these ids or the range of event dates.p  pI have found that for the actual date subtraction part, that the function TIMESTAMPDIFFDAY, date1, date2 works with DAY as the unit. Its the part of actually using this function over multiple ids with each id having a range of events in the data that Im having trouble with.p  pHow can I calculate the desired result in MySQL The dates will always be in the correct order. The example displayed them in order from earliest to latest, but I can rearrange them from latest to earliest, if needed. Additionally, I can use code to have the ids that have only one event taken out if need be. Thank you for any insight you can give.p

Negative 46220 pI added what I think are the important parts to the fiddle.  Basically, all my files are currently in one dir.  The CSS puts a background image on the div slides using a relative path.  Then, using javascript and an array, I want to change the background image.  However, the js only works if I put in an absolute path to the imagep  pThe fiddle wont display the images, but the structure is there.  Normally, I have a function that increments i and displays the corresponding picture, but i didnt think that was necessary for troubleshooting.p  pThe reason Im trying to use relative paths is because i may need to be able to copy and paste the whole folder or use it from a usb drive on a pc that doesnt have internet access.p  pIn dev console, when I set i  1 and run the function, the background is blank.  When i have absolute paths set and do the same thing, it displays the correct picture according to the i value.p  pThanks for any helpp  pEDIT when i combine all my code into the html doc, everything works with relative paths.

Negative 46220 pI have following questions related to the code unit tests for the classes which are pretty much integrated with the database logic. E.g. My class method calls another class that executes a database query or stored procedure.p  pstrongIf I dont want to to involve real database during unit testing what are the optionsstrongp  pMany people use the interface driven approach in which I will have to declare an interface. Then during unit testing, I will have to provide an implementation of the interface which  does not work with the real database.  p  pI know that in real world I will not have various implementations of the same interface. So the concrete class is OK for me.  But is it advisable to declare an interface just for the sake of unit testing p  pIf we declare an interface and write unit tests using it, I may want to decide an implementation during test execution, then we may have to start thinking of the  IoC containers to inject concrete class at runtime. Now this makes application unnecessarily complex.p  pstrongHow to deal with thisstrong p

Negative 46220 pI have this annoying problem and I get the feeling its because we cant use defaults for Backbone Views as we would with Backbone Models. My goal was to use defaults with a Backbone View and then override them with options passed to the initialize function as desired.

Only one of these two views is enabled, the user can choose the way he wants to see the items. p  pSo, in codeonCreateViewcodemethod of my codeFragmentcode I havep  precodegv  GridView v.findViewByIdR.id.itemselectgridview lv  ListView v.findViewByIdR.id.itemselectlistview if UserPreferences.isViewStyleGridgetActivity      showList  else      showGrid  codepre  pAnd the code of codeshowListcodeand codeshowGridcodeisp  precodeprivate void showList      gv.setVisibilityView.GONE     lv.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE     UserPreferences.getPreferencesgetActivity.edit             .putStringConstants.VIEWSTYLE, list.commit   private void showGrid      lv.setVisibilityView.GONE     gv.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE     UserPreferences.getPreferencesgetActivity.edit             .putStringConstants.VIEWSTYLE, grid.commit  codepre  pWhen the app calls codeshowListcode, I cannot use a dpad game controller to navigate the codeListViewcode. Pressing the dpad keys is not effective and only touch input works. If the app calls codeshowGridcode instead, the dpad works properly. If I switch from grid to list at runtime, the dpad works properly also on the codeListViewcode, the switch is made using the same methods mentioned before. What could cause this problem I tried to use codelv.setFocusabletruecodeand codelv.requestFocuscodewith no results.p

Negative 46220 pThere have been tons of questions on how to programmatically access the SMS messages stored in the iPhone. Doing a small research you will quickly and sadly find out that Apple wont let us developers touch the SMS API or SMS database due to obvious security reasons. Lets set this fact apart for a moment.p  pI own a BMW car that comes equipped with a fantastic infotainment system called iDrive. Just recently I realized that I could actually read incoming text messages through the iDrive system when my iPhone is connected to the USB. That really intrigued me. After playing around with the car and the phone configuration, I finally figured out that the iDrive was actually displaying text messages from the Notification Center. This means that every time I get a new message, it would be displayed as a notification in the lock screen and the car would be able to access it because Notification Center has public APIs. As soon as I removed the Messages app from the notification, I got nothing back.p  pAs many of you have thought before, I also wanted to create an app that could monitor incoming text messages and take some action based on keywords scanned from the message body. p  pUntil now, I was really inclined toward moving to Android in order to set me free, however, watching the car displaying incoming text messages makes me see some light at the end of the tunnel.p  pDoes anybody have a clue on how to build an iOS app that can read entries from the Notification Center I tried some research but this seems to be such a broad matter that it can be difficult to find specific documentation for iOS Notification Center.p  pI should mention that I am not an experienced iOS developer, so any help will be very appreciated. p  pBTW  I can never understand Apple official documentation support anyway. Kind of confusing to find a complete example of a running app.p  pThanks for the help. Fabiop

Negative 46220 pI have a scenario in which I need to use FTPGET to recursively download and organize a fair amount of images usually, 23k 1mb .jpgs at a time. p  pIve built the entire system and never once actually opened a downloaded image, as the file size is an exact match and no errors or issues had sprung up until now. Dohp  pHowever, as the project is nearing completion...Ive noticed that ALL the downloaded images are heavily distorted but obviously arent on the remote server. p  pIll provide any additional information you may need, but heres what I think is relevant.p  pA new connection is opened, then a single image is downloaded, then the connection is closed. I know it would be better to download multiple files per connection, but due to certain circumstance this is an easier option. Is it possible Im somehow closing the connection too early even though the filesize matches Im using the regular, blocking ftpget as opposed to ftpnbget...so, I wouldnt suspect this as an issue, but figured that I would mention it anyway.p  precodeif  ftpgetftp, localfile, serverfile, FTPBINARY  codepre  pThe above is the relevant code, which is wrapped in a for each loop.

Negative 46220 pIm trying to create a MV date field using the date picker, The closest I have been able to get is to use the date picker to store a date in a viewScope then have a button to Add the date to the existing MV Date field.

The field that Im storing the values in must be editable so that can remove a value if need be, but not smooth at all.
