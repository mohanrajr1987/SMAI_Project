Theres more throughout the full version of my questionnaire and to my knowledge they all show up fine.  What is it about this one thats triggering this to happenp  pUPDATEp  pok I right clicked and selected view source AND inspect element and it is indeed showing the textarea tag being rendered into a self closing tag.

Positive 2794 pI am experiencing the following problem with a emcursorem display while scrolling a text area in strongSafaristrong on strongiPhone 5strong.

Negative 2794 pUsing HyperV I built a private windows domain which is fenced off from our main network. Ultimately I want to provision this domain for others to use for dev and test, so they can be domain admin. p  pThe domain controller is running the dhcp service other systems in my domain have dependencies on dhcp. The problem is, if some idiot i.e. me accidently connects the domain controller to the main network it will respond to dhcp requests this is an assumption and hand out invalid ip configurations.p  pSo, I would like to write a .NET windows service which starts the local dhcp service only when no other dhcp servers are available.

Negative 2794 pI have a java webapp which needs to upload files via http and then store them on the server.

The DBAs have indicated that their preferred option is to store the reference as a BFILE.

Since the directory was available to the webapp anyway, we then decided that the BFILE was not required and just to store the filename in the database instead.p

Could anyone offer some suggestionsp  h1Edith1  pI suppose the main problem Im having with this is simulating the codeyieldcode statement. As I understand it, it is a pretty simplelooking, but in reality complex, statement it creates a generator with its own codeitercode and codenextcode methods which are called automatically. Searching through the docs, it seems to be associated with the a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgcapigen.htmlPyGenObjecta however, how to create a new instance of this object is unclear. codePyGenNewcode takes as its argument a codePyFrameObjectcode, the only reference to which I can find is a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgcapireflection.htmlcodePyEvalGetFramecodea, which doesnt seem to be what I want or am I mistaken. Does anyone have any experience with this they can sharep  h1Further Edith1  pI found this to be clearer when I essentially expanded what Python was doing behind the scenesp  precodeclass IterObject     def initself, max         self.max  max     def iterself         self.i  0         return self     def nextself         if self.i gt self.max             raise StopIteration         self.i  1         return self.i  class Sequence     def initself, max         self.max  max     def dataself         return IterObjectself.max codepre  pTechnically the sequence is off by one but you get the idea.p  pThe only problem with this is its very annoying to create a new object every time one needs a generator even more so in Python than C because of the required monstrosity that comes with defining a new type. And there can be no codeyieldcode statement in C because C has no closures. What I did instead since I couldnt find it in the Python API empleaseem point me to a standard object if it already exists was create a simple, generic generator object class that called back a C function for every codenextcode method call.

Negative 2794 pI have been searching but have come up blank and im wondering if I can use one jQuery statement to target multiple elements on a page. I have several identical buttons on a page and they are each made up of a left, middle and right background where the middle contains the text and can expand to any size necessary. Each has a unique Id andor Class. I have it setup now so that when you mouse over their container div the 3 backgrounds change to give the appearance that the buttons are in a different state. The way its done now is with 1 hover call for each button which is located by Class would rather use ID but you cant have multiple elements with the same ID. This hover is followed by 8 events. A background change for each right left and middle and a color change for the middles text. p  pThis means lots of lines of code. What I want is to be able to call all the buttons at once with the hover event or to have the hover event somehow know which button is being hovered over and to throw that class or id or even name back to jQuery which can then change the buttons subclasses for right left and middle. The subclass for right left and Middle are identical on all the buttons so if the hover event could be focused on whatever event called it id only need one set of calls to change the background attributes... The current code is below for two of the buttons...p  precodej.learnMoreButton.hover     function            j.learnMoreButton .buttonLeft.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnLeft2.gif          j.learnMoreButton .buttonMiddle.cssbackgroundimage, urlimagesconcaveBtnMiddle2.gif          j.learnMoreButton .buttonMiddle a.csscolorffffff         j.learnMoreButton .buttonRight.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnRight2.gif     ,      function            j.learnMoreButton .buttonLeft.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnLeft.gif         j.learnMoreButton .buttonMiddle.cssbackgroundimage, urlimagesconcaveBtnMiddle.gif          j.learnMoreButton .buttonMiddle a.csscolor, 666         j.learnMoreButton .buttonRight.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnRight.gif                j.bioButton.hover     function            j.bioButton .buttonLeft.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnLeft2.gif          j.bioButton .buttonMiddle.cssbackgroundimage, urlimagesconcaveBtnMiddle2.gif          j.bioButton .buttonMiddle a.csscolorffffff         j.bioButton .buttonRight.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnRight2.gif     ,      function            j.bioButton .buttonLeft.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnLeft.gif         j.bioButton .buttonMiddle.cssbackgroundimage, urlimagesconcaveBtnMiddle.gif          j.bioButton .buttonMiddle a.csscolor, 666         j.bioButton .buttonRight.cssbackgroundurlimagesconcaveBtnRight.gif               codepre

Negative 2794 pI have not been able to find a solution to this problem and my post to the Seam forum has gone unanswered.  I am hope someone here can help.p  pI am a noob working with Seam, so I am sure I am just doing something stupid. Any help anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated... I have wasted hours and gotten nowhere. I used the jboss tools to generate a seam project in eclipse. The tool took precreated JPA entities and created a basic webapp. My first step was to add a registration page so that I can create some users and login using database authentication I set this up, but will test it once the registration page works. I used the seambooking example to guide me basically integrating the form stuff plus additional fields into the view of the seamgen app. When I test the registration page, I get NullPointerExceptions for all of the injected fields. I have looked through the entire seambooking example, scoured the web looking at examples, and quickly read through some sections of a book and I do not see where there is any additional configuration information needed.

So basically Im trying to simulate perspective on a two dimensional quad in orthographic projection, any ideas Is it even mathematically possiblefeasiblep  pideally what Id like is a situation where I can set an xy rotation as well as a virtual z position which simulates z depth through a function and see it internally calclate the positionsuvs to create the 3D effect.

Negative 2794 pIm facing an issue with NHibernate performance and can you please suggest me some optimizations Below mentioned is a small summary of my application architecturep  pI have a windows service which is listening to a messaging bus. On receiving a message the service creates an object out of which a property is the received xml snippet and saves the message to the DB uses NH. There is a WPF UI with a readonly connection to the DB, and on refresh of the UI it displays the objects on the screen. While the UI does a refresh, it retrieves the xml and deserializes it , from which the objects properties are derived and binded to the screen.p  pFor example assume an xml XXX is received by the service, it deserializes the xml , creates the book object and save it to the DB and a propertycolumn  is SCHEMA which contains the xml snippet.p  pThe UI while refreshed searches all book objects by ID and creates the book objects out of the xml which is being saved yes, the xml is the constructor param.p  pNow my issue is that the refresh takes more than 2 minutes to display say 50 book objects. I analyzed it using the NHibernate profiler, and found that the time spend within the DB is negligible, however time spent to create the entities is proportionally huge10ms1990 ms.I guess its due to the fairly huge size of xml snippet and its deserialization.p  pMy question is, how can I improve the performance. I dispose sessions after every refresh and is not lazy loading please note that the time spend in DB is negligible. On every refresh its possible that all objects are updated by some downstream systems or maybe one of them are updated.Can I implement some sort of caching mechanism in this casep  pThanks in advance for any suggestions.p  pRegards, Mikep

Negative 2794 pIn my Rails app I have a fairly standard hasmany relationship between two entities. A codeFoocode has zero or more codeBarscode a codeBarcode belongs to exactly one codeFoocode. Both Foo and Bar are identified by a single integer ID value. These values are unique across all of their respective instances.p  pBar is existence dependent on Foo it makes no sense to have a Bar without a Foo.p  pTheres two ways to RESTfully references instances of these classes. Given a Foo.id of 100 and a Bar.id of 200p  ol lipReference each Foo and Bar through their own toplevel URL routes, like sop  ul lifoo100li libar200li ulli lipReference Bar as a nested resource through its instance of Foop  ul lifoo100li lifoo100bar200li ulli ol  pI like the nested routes in 2 as it more closely represents the actual dependency relationship between the entities. However, it does seem to involve a lot of extra work for very little gain. Assuming that I know about a particular Bar, I dont need to be told about a particular Foo I can derive that from the Bar itself. In fact, I probably should be validating the routed Foo everywhere I go so that you couldnt do foo150bar200, assuming Bar 200 is not assigned to Foo 150. Ultimately, I dont see what this brings me.p  pSo, are there any emotherem arguments for or against these two routing schemesp  h2Point of Clarificationh2  pIm concerned mostly about RESTful updatesshowsdeletes to particular Bars. For getting a list of Bars for a specific Foo which is usually the index action in Rails it makes perfect sense to have a nested route such as foo100bar. The page at this route could just as easily link to barx as foo100barx though.p

Negative 2794 pIm looking to write a small web service to run on a small Linux box. I prefer to code in C, so Im looking to use Mono.p  pI dont want the overhead of running a full web server or Monos version of ASP.NET. Im thinking of having a single process with a thread dealing with each client connection. Shared memory between threads instead of a database.p  pIve read a little on Microsofts version of HttpListener and how it works with the Http.sys driver. Alas, Monos documentation on this class is just the automated class interface with no discussion of how it works under the hood. Linux doesnt have Http.sys, so I imagine its implemented substantially differently.p  pCould anyone point me towards some resources discussing this module pleasep  pMany thanks, Bill, billpg.comp  pA little background to my question for the interested.p  pSome time ago, I asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1024403whatprotocolshouldiuseforfastcommandresponseinteractionsthis questiona, interested in keeping a long conversation open with lots of backandforth. I had settled on designing my own adhoc protocol, but people I spoke to really wanted a REST interface, even at the cost of the Okay, send your command now signal.p  pSo, I wondered about running ASP.NET on a LinuxMono server, but stumbled upon HttpListener. This seemed ideal, as each conversation could run in a separate thread. The thread that calls HttpListener in a loop can look for which thread each incomming connection is for and pass the reference to that thread.p  pThe alternative for an ASP.NET driven service, would be to have the ASPX code pick up the state from a database, and write back the new state when it finishes. Yes, it would work, but thats a lot of overhead.p

Negative 2794 pMy program often deals with large quantities of data, and one particular component of it creates a subset of that data, based on a condition.

Ive phrased it as I have above both to try to explain it clearly, and also to try to keep this focused on algorithms or techniques, not our specific implementation and data.p  ul listrongEditstrong Thanks to those who have replied so far.  All suggestions revolve around multithreading, which I agree is a good approach and we do have a threaded task framework this would fit into.  I was hoping that the problem itself can be treated as an algorithmic problem  I suspect, though I dont know, that its a general sort of problem applicable to searching through all sorts of data.  In this light, an awesome reply would be Schwarzenegger et al proposed algorithm X for this in 1995, google this term.li ul  pOur current approach is a singlethreaded linear search from the first point we already know in the input data set, along the array, calculating if an element needs to be kept or not and building the results as we go.  Often the requested data subset is not at the beginning  using the string example, you might need to know, say, elements 815 if 15 exist, which you might not know until youve hit the end of the input data.  Of course, we dont know what element 8 of the output dataset is in the input dataset until weve processed that far from the beginning.p  pstrongHow else should we solve this problemstrongp  pI am seeking input on any completely different approaches or algorithms to solve this kind of problem.p  ul lipWhat other approaches are there to this problem, ie quickly getting an arbitrary subsetpli lipKnowing the current solution is computationbound because of the amount of processing per element, or rather, because it requires each element to be generated in order to examine it to see if its a 0, what algorithms or approaches might you suggest to tackle the problem  Is there any way to minimise the work the program doespli ul  pIf it affects specific libraries or tools, we are using C not managed we use a hrefhttpwww.embarcadero.comproductscbuilder relnofollowEmbarcadero C Builder 2010a.

Negative 2794 pI was wondering what is considered best practice. Lets say I have a dropdown select widget. Should it be preloaded with content when the page is served up from the server or once it is loaded, should an AJAX request be made to retrieve the contents and then populate itp  pI kinda like the idea of loading it empty and issuing an AJAX call to retrieve the contents. But is that going to result in slower page loading times. Especially if the page has several widgets that need to be loaded with content from the serverp  pDoes it matter on the amount of content being loadedp  pFor the dropdown example, I meant the options in the dropdown. So if I had a dropdown of employees to choose, from I am referring to that list of employees. Do I load an empty dropdown and on init of the controller have it retrieve the employees and populate the dropdownp  pBut then I think about a datagrid of lets say 200 rows of emplyees and some employee data that is stored in a database. Do I load the page and when the page loads have a controller whose init function retrieves the dataset of employees and populates and displays the datagridp  pOr when the page is served up from the server does it retrieve the dataset on the serverside where it also creates the datagrid and it gets loaded then. This is the programming world that I am used to having done mostly PHP, JSP and ASP stuff in the past. Only using JavaScript for some cool page effects, etc.p  pBut I seem to like the idea of once the page is loaded or being loaded, make AJAX requests to retrieve the data needed to populate the widgetscontent on the current screen. I am just concerned that the loading of page might seem clunky or slow since I am now making more requests to the server to paint the page. The initial request for the page, and then a request for each dataset needed to populate a widget.p

Another example a hrefhttpcfarrell.blogspot.com201011usrbinenvpythonimportwebfromweb.html relnofollowhttpcfarrell.blogspot.com201011usrbinenvpythonimportwebfromweb.htmla does a similar technique but makes more sense to me.  p  precodeusrbinenv python import web from web import webopenid urls   , index, openid, webopenid.host,   ... more code ...  class index   def GETself     oid  webopenid.status     if not oid       return please log in            webopenid.formopenid     else       return you are logged in as                 webopenid.formopenid codepre  pHeres where I get a little lost.  From what I can tell, the argument passed to codeformcode is the return URL after signing in.  For example, if I put httpwww.yahoo.com it will take me there after every login attempt.  I feel like this should point back to my own controller and just check there, but the convention seems to be to use the web.webopenid.host controller, which I guess handles the id and returns to the base  url.  I think Im getting there, but the status returned is always codeNonecode.  p  pFrom what I gather then, this is either a code issue, or theres something in my apache configuration that is keeping the authentication from working.  In web.webopenid, the library creates a .openidsecretkey file in the same directory as the web server.  When I run the example code, this gets created.  When I run my code through apache, it does not at least not in the cgibin.  Somewhere else  Anyway, if this file isnt being generated or being regenerated every time, it will keep me from logging in.  I believe its an apache issue as I tried running my app through the web.py webserver and I did get the file created and I can authenticate.  All I can conclude is this file isnt being written and every subsequent query tries a new file and I can never authentication.  Can any apachemodwsgi gurus explain to me where this file is being written or if this is the actual problem  p

E.g. when I replace codeSortedDictionarycode with codeSortedListcode I can dop  precodeint ix1  sortedList.IndexOfKeyfirst.Key int ix2  sortedList.IndexOfKeylast.Key var range  sortedList.SkipWhilex, i gt i lt ix1.TakeWhilex, i gt i lt ix2 codepre  pAlso with codeSortedDictionarycode I can dop  precodevar range  sortedList.SkipWhilex gt x.Key.ToString.StartsWithsearchkey                       .TakeWhilex gt x.Key.ToString.StartsWithsearchkey codepre  pI will have to test which method is faster and also have to test the Where query.p
Negative 2794 pI am using repository pattern in a .NET C application that does not use an ORM. However the issue I am having is how to fill Onetomany List properties of an entity. e.g. if a customer has a list of orders i.e. if the Customer class has a List property called Orders and my repository has a method called GetCustomerById, thenp  ul liShould I load the Orders list within the GetCustomerById methodli liWhat if the Order itself has another list property and so onli liWhat if I want to do lazy loading Where would I put the code to load the Orders property in customer Inside the Orders property get accessor But then I would have to inject repository into the domain entity which I dont think is the right solution.li ul  pThis also raises questions for Features like Change Tracking, Deleting etc So i think the end result is can I do DDD without ORM p  pBut right now I am only interested in lazy loading List properties in my domain entities Any ideap  pNabeelp  pI am assuming this is a very common issue for anyone not using an ORM in a Domain Driven Design Any ideap

To do this Id like to load everything into Flash Builder and manipulate it programatically  showing and hiding scenes, scrolling, checking for collisions etc.p  pIve found guides to exporting a swc from Flash Pro and accessing the library in Flash Builder, but this only gives me the classes, not the positioned instances of objects.

Negative 2794 pI am writing a program that uses an unmanaged library. What is a best practice to handle a situation where the available emfoo.dllem is of an incompatible versionp  pExamples The user starts up the program and has an older version of the DLL than that which the program is expecting. Would you try to use it anyway, as breaking API changes should be uncommon in a mature library Immediately error out Maintain a resource in the program with download locations to every unmanaged DLL used Or is it considered best to include every DLL in the projects own folder and insist on using exactly that filep  pFor now, I do the latter, and update the DLL with new project versions, but Id like my software to be as faulttolerant as is practical and I am unaware of any best practices for the use of unmanaged DLLs other than dont use them unless you have to.p

Negative 2794 pI am writing an HttpModule in VS2010ASP.NET 4.0 for use with IIS 7. The module is going to enforce query string security by encrypting query strings.p  pI would like this module to be completely independent of as well as transparent to the website, so that the website has no knowledge of the fact that query string encryption is being employed. This will ensure firstly that pagescontrols dont have to care about this issue. Secondly, it would enable query string encryption for Production environments and disable it for nonProduction ones by removing the HTTP module from the Web.config.p  pI have designed the HttpModule to get plugged into IIS via the Web.config byp  precodeltconfigurationgt     ltsystem.webgt         lthttpModulesgt             ltadd nameQueryStringSecurityModule typeMyHttpModules.QueryStringSecurityModulegt         lthttpModulesgt     ltsystem.webgt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pThe module itself looks like thisp  precodepublic class QueryStringSecurityModule  IHttpModule      public virtual void InitHttpApplication application              application.BeginRequest  HandleBeginRequest         application.EndRequest  HandleEndRequest         application.ReleaseRequestState  HandleReleaseRequestState           public virtual void Dispose                private void HandleBeginRequestobject sender, EventArgs e               TODO  Decrypt the query string here and pass it on to the application           private void HandleEndRequestobject sender, EventArgs e               TODO  Twiddle thumbs           private void HandleReleaseRequestStateobject sender, EventArgs e              var response  HttpContext.Current.Response          if response.ContentType  texthtml                      response.Filter  new QueryStringSecurityStreamresponse.Filter                codepre  pThere is a class QueryStringSecurityStream which is used to fiddle with the HTML output in the Response, and secure all  tags by replacing the query strings therein with encrypted ones.p  precodepublic QueryStringSecurityStream  Stream      public QueryStringSecurityStreamStream stream          base                public override void Writebyte[] buffer, int offset, int count              var html  Encoding.Default.GetStringbuffer, offset, count.ReplaceHRefsWithSecureHRefs         var bytes  Encoding.Default.GetByteshtml          this.stream.Writebytes, 0, bytes.Length       codepre  pThe magic happens, or is supposed to happen, in the ReplaceHRefsWithSecureHRefs extension method.p  pThis method expects the ementireem HTML.

This HTML will then be written out to the Response stream.p  pSo far so good. All of this falls over because I suspect that ReleaseRequestState is raised multiple times for individual requests.

I have asked Mr. Google and Mr. MSDN but havent found anything definitive. I seem to remember hitting something similar while debugging WSDL from an ASMX web service running in IIS 6.

Let the answers roll in.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI read this a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms178473.aspx relnofollowarticle on MSDN on request lifecycleap  pI have solved this issue for myself by creating a buffer to store response content across multiple calls to ReleaseRequestState.

Negative 2794 pI have an ASP.NET page with a Wizard control containing several pages of form fields. The data is collected and inserted to a database from the code behind page. I need to set this form up so you can not only insert, but edit a record as well. Since the form is long and complex, I would rather use the existing one and not make a duplicate one for editing, especially since I want to keep both forms exactly the same and any edits would have to be made to both. But it looks like this is what I need to do if Im going to databind it. But this would also involve putting the Wizard inside of a FormView, and then Id have to use FindControl to access any of the fields which would mean altering all my alreadyexisting code which of course would be timeconsuming. So should I manually enter all the values from the code behind instead of databinding it Which is better, to use a FormView and have duplicate forms plus have to go in and redo the way I access the fields, or to do everything from the code behindp

Negative 2794 pI am using RedHat EL 4. I am using Bash 3.00.15.p  pI am writing SystemVerilog and I want to emulate stdin and stdout. I can only use files as the normal stdin and stdout is not supported in the environment. I would like to use named pipes to emulate stdin and stdout.p  pI understand how to create a tosv and fromsv file using mkpipe, and how to open them and use them in SystemVerilog.p  pBy using cat  tosv I can output strings to the SystemVerilog simulation. But that also outputs what Im typing in the shell.p  pI would like, if possible, a single shell where it acts almost like a UART terminal. Whatever I type goes directly out to tosv, and whatever is written to fromsv gets printed out.p  pIf I am going about this completely wrong, then by all means suggest the correct way Thank you so much,p  pNachum Kanovskyp

Negative 2794 pI have just started learning Sencha Touch and I love it so far. I have started building thumbnail carousel gallery with a popup that appears on touching each thumbnail. So far so good, it works as expected. However I am conscious that the way I have coded some things may not be best practice. I have watched all the tutorial videos.p  pBasically I have added an event listener to each thumbnail so far I have 8 thumbnails, and 8 listeners...that trigger 8 separate popup windows. p  pI think there must be a better way of doing it, perhaps having one listener on the body of the carousel, and 1 popup perhaps with a template function, that calls variables from elsewhere.

Negative 2794 pAssume I have NSNumbers 1  450. I can choose to add them to an NSMutableArray either starting with 1 and ending with 450, or starting with 450 and ending with 1. My code would be a little simpler if I could start with 1 and end with 450, but when the time finally comes for me to enumerate over the array, I will ultimately need to reverse it. In other words, I need the first object in the enumeration to be 450, and the last one to be 1.p  pSince my code would be simpler if I do it this way add starting with 1, then reverse it prior to enumeration, its my preferred method. However, the Apple documentation for code NSEnumerator reverseObjectEnumeratorcode saysp  blockquote   pIt is more efficient to use the fast enumeration protocol see   NSFastEnumeration.

Negative 2794 pi need some clarification pleasep  pthe process is essentially as follow client fills out form, hits continue button and series of PDFs get generated based on data from form.  i want to use PayPal right after the continue button gets pressed.  after payment, PDFs get generated.  what is the best way to inject PayPal WHILE preserving form data BEFORE PDFs get cranked out  i wanted to use JSON to send it to the SESSION array, but i dont think it will survive the interruption.  this is the method id prefer to use, unless theres a good reason not to.p  pORp  pwould it be best to just go ahead and crank out the PDFs but just NOT send the PDFs until after PayPal does its thing  regardless, how do i preserve variables while PayPal does its thingp  pand, yes, im a relative PayPal noob, so if theres something im missing that would seem obvious, dont be a noughthead and try to get some mileage by trying to make me look stupid.  im looking for answers, not ridicule.  i can get PayPal working but thats not the point.  i want to keep the site working with PayPal working in the middle.p  pand if this isnt the kind of question that gets answered here, please point me in the right direction before you delete this.p  pWRp

Negative 2794 pMy requirement is to enter strings into an array which are not in the array. I also need to maintain fixed indexes, as this array will be used with other data structure with a onetoone relation with each index. At present i am using the codeArrayListcode class and checking with the codeindexOf code method to check if it exists first, if not then add it into the list with the codeadd code method with one argument. I am not familiar to the classes in java, and therefore could not understand how can i implement it with codeHashMapcode or something else trie or else, which will  make the loading process fast .p  pDo the codeindexOf code in codeArrayListcode makes a sequential search  My point is to reduce the processing time when loading the words into the array, with not inserting duplicates, and maintain fixed index of the elements. If a word tested is already in the array, emthen the index in which it is already inserted is requiredem, as this index is needed to index into some other structure and do some processing. Any suggestions to make this process betterp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThere is an array, i have some documents from where i need to scan each word and find unique words in the documents. But also i need to count the number of duplicates. Stated in other way, i need to count the term frequencies of the unique terms occurring in the documents. I am maintaining a codeArrayListltInteger[]gtcode of term frequency number of terms x number of docs. I am fetching one word and then checking if it is in the word list with the codeindexOf code method. If it is not present in the word list, then i am inserting the word into the list, and allocating a new row in the 2d array the codeArrayltInteger[]gtcode and then setting the count of the term element in 2d array to 1. If the word is already in the word array, then i use the index of the word in the array to index in the row of the codeArrayltInteger[]gtcode matrix, and use the current under processing document number to get to the cell and increment the count.p  pMy question is to reduce the codeindexOf code processing time for each word i am currently using. I need to get the index of the word in the word array if it is already in there, and if it is not in there then i need to insert it into the array dynamically.p  pstrongSample Codestrongp  precodeimport java.io. import java.util.ArrayList import static java.lang.Math.log   class DocumentRepresentation    private String dirPath   private ArrayListltStringgt fileNameVector   private ArrayListltStringgt termVector   private ArrayListltInteger[]gt tf  store it in natural 2d array    private Integer df[]  do normal 1d array    private Double idf[]  do normal 1d array    private Double tfIdf[][]  do normal 2d array     DocumentRepresentation String dirPath        this.dirPath  dirPath     fileNameVector  new ArrayListltStringgt      termVector  new ArrayListltStringgt      tf  new ArrayListltInteger[]gt         Later sepatere the internal works    public int start          Load the files, and populate the fileNameVector string      File fileDir  new File dirPath     int fileCount  0     int index      if fileDir.isDirectory   false            return 1           File fileList[]  fileDir.listFiles       for int i0 iltfileList.length i            if fileList[i].isFile   true                fileNameVector.add fileList[i].getName                System.out.print File Name   i  1     fileList[i].getName   n                  fileCount  fileNameVector.size      for int i0iltfileNameVector.size  i            System.out.print Name   i1     fileNameVector.get i  n            Bind the files with a buffered reader      BufferedReader fileReaderVector[]  new BufferedReader [fileCount]     for int i0 iltfileCount i            try                fileReaderVector[i]  new BufferedReader new FileReader fileList[i]               Not handled        catch FileNotFoundException e                System.out.println e                   Scan the term frequencies in the tf 2d array      for int i0 iltfileCount i            String line        try                     THIS IS THE PLACE OF MY QUESTION          while line  fileReaderVector[i].readLine   null                    String words[]  line.split [W]            for int j0jltwords.lengthj                         if index  termVector.indexOf words[j]  1                            tf.get index[i]                increase the tf count                           else                            termVector.add words[j]               Integer temp[]  new Integer [fileCount]                for int k0 kltfileCount k                                temp[k]  new Integer 0                              temp[i]  1               tf.add temp               index  termVector.indexOf words[j]                           System.out.println words[j]                                   Not handled        catch IOException e                System.out.println e                  return 0      class DocumentRepresentationTest    public static void main String args[]        DocumentRepresentation docSet  new DocumentRepresentation args[0]     docSet.start      System.out.print n     codepre  pemNote code is snipped to keep the focus on the questionemp

Basically   Tell me to go for Interfaces I have never done one from scratch myself. Or .. throw me a bone in the direction you would suggest.p  pMy current source pool is as stated in the second link  from the top.p  pHere is a small snippet from my earlier a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq9140485696574posta that shows my covariance problem. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers505088davidheffernanDavida kindly explained  Why I ran into the bush..

Negative 2794 pWhen working with asp.net MVC 3, the default website which is installed from the template has an codeAccountModelcode. Within this, there are codeDataAnnotationcodes for the password property and here the codeMinimumLengthcode of the codeStringLengthcode is set.p  pHowever, within the .NET framework Membership provider, you can set the codeminRequiredPasswordLengthcode via the codeweb.configcode file.p  pNow if you were to set the codeminRequiredPasswordLengthcode to say 6, yet have the codeAccountModel.passwordcode codeMinimumLengthcode set to 1, then you would not be able to register if your password is only 1 character in length. Same the other way around, codeminRequiredPasswordLengthcode is 1 and codeMinimumLengthcode is 6 will not allow registration.p  pSo to me this is a bit backwards. If an installation of the app does not require the a longer password length, then you have to change this in the model.p  pcodeDataAnnotationscode have to be constant values from what I have read, so is there a way to link these two Ideally I would like to only have to change the value in the codeweb.configcode and not have to worry about rebuilding projects.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI noticed after looking into this more that Pre MVC 3 Tools Update, the Project Template actually contained a DataAnnotation which linked the Membership codeminRequiredPasswordLengthcode property from the codeweb.configcode to the codeAccountModelcode Blogged about it here a hrefhttptimjames.memvc3passwordlengthdataannotation relnofollowhttptimjames.memvc3passwordlengthdataannotationap
Negative 2794 pI have an codeActivitycode that starts and binds to a codeServicecode. I then have another codeActivitycode, launched from the first.

If that happens, I lose my reference to my codeServicecode and consequently run into a codeNullPointerExceptioncode in codeonActivityResultcode.

Negative 2794 pFirst, some contextp  pIm currently working on a project in which I use the Spring framework on Googles AppEngine GAE to fetch some data from one of Googles services. To do so, I make use of Googles OAuth facilities. For this, I need to use a codeclientSecretcode and codeclientIdcode that are specific to my application. As these are static configuration values, I use Springs codeltutilpropertiesgtcode a hrefhttpstatic.springsource.orgspringdocs3.1.xspringframeworkreferencehtmlxsdconfig.htmlxsdconfigbodyschemasutilproperties relnofollowlink to documentationa functionality to insert these values into the appropriate classes.p  pXML configp  precodeltutilproperties idgoogleProperties locationWEBINFgoogle.properties gt codepre  pClass usagep  precodeValuegoogleProperties[google.data.api.client.id] private String clientId codepre  pMy Questionp  pAs it turns out, the values of codeclientIdcode and codeclientSecretcode need to be different for production when deployed on App Engine as for development on my local machine. In order to solve this without constantly needing to change the values in the properties file when deploying, I have been looking into Springs configuration codeprofilescode that would allow me to specify different property files for production and for development. Although I have an idea how Spring profiles work based a hrefhttpblog.springsource.com20110211springframework31m1released relnofollowon the documentationa, I am not at all sure what the appropriate solution would be in this particular situation.p  pIn other words, how can I inject different property files based on whether my application is deployed locally or on GAEp

The size of this array is   implementation dependent and can be queried with glGet with the   symbolic constant GLMAXDRAWBUFFERS. The offscreen buffers that are   modified as a result of writing values into glFragData within a   fragment shader are specified with glDrawBuffers. The value written   into glFragData[0] updates the first buffer in the list specified in   the call to glDrawBuffers, the value written into glFragData[1]   updates the second buffer in the list, and so on.p blockquote  pIts not specified that 0th value of glFragData is always color buffer.

Negative 2794 pI am new to PHP and am confused on what I thought would be a basic task. I have a lightbox that displays a list of documents kept as BLOBs in a MySQL database. I have checkboxes next to each document and a print button at the bottom. I simply want the user to select which documents to print and once they hit the print button their print dialog box opens. These are various formats, pdf, doc, xls, etc. My question is how do I send various formats at once to the print dialog without having to show the documents themselves or am I conceptually way off here Do I need to create another lightbox that shows all the pages we want to print first and then just print everything in that lightbox Is that even possible with various formats A little push in the right direction here conceptually or even a good tutorial on php, javascript and printing options would be helpful. All my google searches dealt with printing to the screen. I need to print, print to a printer not display the BLOBs on the screen.  p

However the OnItemSelected is automatically selecting the first item on the list when the activity starts and so the user does not have a chance to actually make a selection until the new window appears.p  pHere is the codep  precodepublic void onItemSelectedAdapterViewltgt arg0, View arg1, int arg2,         long arg3       TODO Autogenerated method stub     startActivitynew Intentcom.lukeorpin.theappliancekeeper.APPLIANCESELECTED       public void onNothingSelectedAdapterViewltgt arg0       TODO Autogenerated method stub codepre  pDoes anyone know a way in which the first item on the list wont be automatically selectedp  pHere is the code for the rest of the spinnerp  precodeArrayAdapterltStringgt appliancenameadapter  new ArrayAdapterltStringgtthis,             android.R.layout.simplespinneritem, ApplianceNames Sets up an array adapter containing the values of the ApplianceNames string array     applianceName  Spinner findViewByIdR.id.spinnername Gives the spinner in the xml layout a variable name     applianceName.setAdapterappliancenameadapter Adds the contents of the array adapter into the spinner      applianceName.setOnItemSelectedListenerthis codepre
Negative 2794 pI have a program which produces a series of functions codefcode and codegcode which looks like the followingp  precodestep f,g  newF f g, newG f g  newF f g x  r f x g x newG f g x  s f x g x  foo  iterate step f0,g0 codepre  pWhere r and s are some uninteresting functions of codef xcode and codeg xcode. I naively hoped that having codefoocode be a list would mean that when I call the nth codefcode it will not recompute the n1th codefcode if it has already computed it as would have happened if codefcode and codegcode werent functions. Is there any way to memoize this without ripping the whole program apart e.g. evaluating codef0code and codeg0code on all relevant arguments and then working upwardp

Negative 2794 pThis may be impossible, but Im trying to save the state of my application between scene transitions, but I cant figure out what to do. Currently I love the way that when you have an application running and hit the home button, you can go back to that application just where you left off, but if you transition between scenes in a storyboard, once you get back to that scene the application state was not saved.p  pI only have two different scenes that need to be saved you transition back and forth from one to the other. How can I go about saving a storyboard scenes state without taking up precise memoryp  pstrongMore Detailedstrong Here is my entire storyboard. You transition back and forth between scenes using the plus toolbar button. On the second scene the user can tap on the table view cells and a real image will fill the image view See figure 1.2p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXV5WH.png altFigure 1.1Figure 1.1p  pIn figure 1.2 you see what happens when you tap inside one of the many table view cells an image view pops up.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commPYRu.png altFigure 1.2 Figure 1.2p  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrong When you tap a table view cell, which fills an image view shown in figure 1.2 it works fine if you stay on that scene or even hit the iPhone home button if you hit the iPhone home button and then reopen the app the scenes state was saved and the image view filled with a simple image still shows just like we left it, but if I transition using the plus button back to the first scene, and then use the plus button on the first scene to get back to the second scene the image view that I created shown in figure 1.2 disappears and the second scene loads without saving the state and image views we filled.p  pstrongEDITstrong I tried using the same view controller for both scenes, but it didnt solve the problem. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I just found the following code that I think stores a views state.

Negative 2794 pIm having a problem using VBA to execute a SQL query and copy the results into an Excel worksheet.p  pWhen the sub excecutes, it only copies rows that are multiples of 256 so rows 256, 512, 768 etc are the only ones that are filled into Excel.  Im having no problem copying any of the other fields from the database.  Also, when I run the same query in MySQL it works fine.  Being fairly new to both SQL and VBA I cant see any reason why this particular field should be causing trouble.  The only thing I can think of is that its contents are a string that always begins with an underscore and I only mention that because its the only difference between it and some of the other fields.p  pDoes anybody have any ideas as to why this may be happeningp  pCheers,p  pLiamp  pEDIT Heres a snippet of the code in question.

Negative 2794 pIm a newcomer to Haskell and am currently going through Real World Haskell. The book says the type constructor is used only in the type signature while the value constructor is used in actual code. It also gives an example of a declaration to show that the names for both are independent of each other. Why are two constructors needed in the first place, if only one of them is used in actual code Since we would not use the type constructor in actual code, what purpose does the type constructor servep

It takes in search keywords and dropdown category filter and returns a datagrid of products as the result, also there is an ajax navigation breadcrumb link like HomeElectronicsLGBDampDVD Players ... on top of the search results as people filter further into the results. However, once I hit F5Refresh button, they are gone as if I first came to the search page.p  pI cant find a good tutorial on Internet.

Negative 2794 pI have a dedicated server with 1GBs dedicated, 4GB ram and 4cpus. I have static files for download from 300mb to 900mb. I was testing over Apache, Nginx and Lighttpd.p  pApache makes too many threats and after 200 connections it goes very high so apache its a NO GO...p  pNginx after 100 connections it goes very high so its a NO GO either.p  pLighttpd so far is very good as is a singlethreaded server. With 500 concurrent connections the load stays at 0.90  1.10 very good but Im facing a download speed problem, it goes slower even when I have 1GBps dedicated port, I see the iptraf and with 500 concurrent connections it goes no more than 250000 KBs. With apache and nginx sometimes it went to 700000 KBs the upstream in the server. I switched between sendfile and writev in the config and it has the same result.p  pIm not using any php or fastcgi, just straight download directly to the file, for example a hrefhttpwww.myserver.comfile.zip relnofollowhttpwww.myserver.comfile.zipa and it downloads the file.p  pI will attach some info here for you to help me figure it out.p  pKernel 2.6p  plighttpd.confp

Negative 2794 pHello I am writing assembly code for 8086 but I am wondering how does CPU differentiate between for examplep  pAND AX, [memoryaddress] and AND AX, memoryaddressp  pwe are putting [] around it to indicate that it should be replaced by that addresses contents but CPU sees a instruction like thatp  p00 01 1101001p  pHow does it know if it should add the value 1101001 or the contents of the address 1101001.p  pI am thinking of there are more than one ADD command and their opcodes are different like ADDTHECONTENTS and ADDTHEVALUE but a86 allows us to just say ADD because we can easily differentiate the semantics from the [] syntax. This seems logical but I am not sure about that so I wanted to ask, if there are many opcodes for instructions corresponding to different addressing modes.p

How is it organized With the Element Namep  pOne more question sorry for the length why isnt the element name case sensitive, I was experimenting and I found it wasnt. Both languages are case sensitive.p
Negative 2794 pGoing through the BigNerdRanchs guide to iOS and one of the tasks is to add a No More Items cell to the bottom of a list of items in a UITableView.

To run it, paste in on codeopencvmodulesimgprocsrcthresh.cppcode, at line 228 as of 2.4.2  just below SSE block, and recompile OpenCV. p  pAlso, add this line at the top of the filep  precodeinclude ltarmneon.hgt codepre  pMain code bodyp  precodedefine CVUSENEON 1 if CVUSENEON     if checkHardwareSupportCVCPUARMNEON      if true               uint8x16t threshu  vdupqnu8thresh         uint8x16t maxval  vdupqnu8maxval          jscalar  roi.width amp 8          for i  0 i lt roi.height i                       const uchar src  const ucharsrc.data  src.stepi             uchar dst  uchardst.data  dst.stepi              switch type                           case THRESHBINARY                 for j  0 j lt roi.width  32 j  32                                       uint8x16t v0, v1                     v0  vld1qu8  src  j                      v1  vld1qu8  src  j  16                      v0  vcgtqu8  v0, threshu                      v1  vcgtqu8  v1, threshu                      v0  vandqu8  v0, maxval                      v1  vandqu8  v1, maxval                      vst1qu8  dst  j, v0                      vst1qu8  dst  j  16, v1                                     for  j lt roi.width  8 j  8                                       uint8x8t v2                     v2  vld1u8 src  j                      v2  vcgtu8  v2, vgetlows8  threshu                       v2  vandu8  v2, vgetlows8  maxval                       vst1u8  dst  j, v2                                                       break              case THRESHBINARYINV                          for j  0 j lt roi.width  32 j  32                                       uint8x16t v0, v1                     v0  vld1qu8  src  j                      v1  vld1qu8  src  j  16                      v0  vclequ8  v0, threshu                      v1  vclequ8  v1, threshu                      v0  vandqu8  v0, maxval                      v1  vandqu8  v1, maxval                      vst1qu8  dst  j, v0                      vst1qu8  dst  j  16, v1                                     for  j lt roi.width  8 j  8                                       uint8x8t v2                     v2  vld1u8 src  j                      v2  vcleu8  v2, vgetlows8  threshu                       v2  vandu8  v2, vgetlows8  maxval                       vst1u8  dst  j, v2                                                       break              case THRESHTRUNC                 for j  0 j lt roi.width  32 j  32                                       uint8x16t v0, v1                     v0  vld1qu8  src  j                      v1  vld1qu8  src  j  16                      v0  vminqu8  v0, threshu                      v1  vminqu8  v1, threshu                                       vst1qu8  dst  j, v0                      vst1qu8  dst  j  16, v1                                     for  j lt roi.width  8 j  8                                       uint8x8t v2                     v2  vld1u8 src  j                      v2  vminu8   v2, vgetlows8  threshu                                        vst1u8  dst  j, v2                                                       break              case THRESHTOZERO                          for j  0 j lt roi.width  32 j  32                                       uint8x16t v0, v1                     v0  vld1qu8  src  j                      v1  vld1qu8  src  j  16                                   v0  vandqu8  vcgtqu8  v0, threshu , vmaxqu8  v0, threshu                       v1  vandqu8  vcgtqu8  v1, threshu , vmaxqu8  v1, threshu                       vst1qu8  dst  j, v0                      vst1qu8  dst  j  16, v1                                     for  j lt roi.width  8 j  8                                       uint8x8t v2                     v2  vld1u8  src  j                                          v2  vandu8  vcgtu8  v2, vgetlows8threshu , vmaxu8  v2, vgetlows8threshu                       vst1u8  dst  j, v2                                                       break              case THRESHTOZEROINV                 for j  0 j lt roi.width  32 j  32                                       uint8x16t v0, v1                     v0  vld1qu8  src  j                      v1  vld1qu8  src  j  16                                   v0  vandqu8  vclequ8  v0, threshu , vminqu8  v0, threshu                       v1  vandqu8  vclequ8  v1, threshu , vminqu8  v1, threshu                       vst1qu8  dst  j, v0                      vst1qu8  dst  j  16, v1                                     for  j lt roi.width  8 j  8                                       uint8x8t v2                     v2  vld1u8  src  j                                          v2  vandu8  vcleu8  v2, vgetlows8threshu , vminu8  v2, vgetlows8threshu                       vst1u8  dst  j, v2                                                       break                            endif codepre

But instead I receive a new error that readsp  precodeThe Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 provider is not registered on the local machine. codepre  pThe title of THIS message is InvalidOperationException was unhandled. And the error is on this linep  precodedb.Open codepre  pdb, of course, being set to a new OleDbConnectionconnection. connection  an Access db.p  pSo my question is why am I receiving the first error, and not the second error, when platform target is x86. And vice versa if the platform target is x64.

Negative 2794 pHi everyone I am new in jdbc and I wanted to find out if there is a way to check if a particular database already exists in mysql. p  pLets say I wanted to create a database named students, if the students database is already created in mysql an error message in eclipse would state that this students database already exists. However what I wanted to do is to create a boolean method to check if students database already exists. If it exists then boolean method would return false otherwise its true then I can create students database.

Negative 2794 pWorking on a sort of Motif GUI design tool. After I programmatically change a property, addremove widgets, move widgets around, etc, I capture a screenshot of the Motif window showing the current window state. FYI, Im using cairo 2d to capture the Xlib surface of the window as a png.p  pMostly this works fine but sometimes my window capture happens before the UI update has completed. In particular Ive noticed this occasionally when changing a widgets font or changing the pixmap on a graphical label.p  pI want to wait until the window has finished drawing the new state before capturing the surface.p  pHow can I do that reliably It looks like Xlib exposure events occur prior to redraw. And I see theres a PropertyChange event  but the documentation doesnt say anything about when it happens in relation to drawing.p

Negative 2794 pI am having a tough time figuring out how I am supposed to implement parentchild relationships between my measure groups in SSAS.  Essentially I am just trying recreate a standard SQL join so that I can lookup measures in my Parent group while using keys in my Child group.p  pFor example, lets say I have the following dimensionsp  ul liParent li liChild FK ParentIDli liTimeli ul  pAnd I have the following measure groupsp  ul liParentFact Keys ParentID, TimeID  Measures Related to the parent over timeli liChildFact Keys ChildID, TimeID  Measures related to the child over timeli ul  pI have not created any specific dimensions for any of my fact tables.p  pIn the end I just want to run a query like this to list out measures in my Child table joined to measures in my Parent tablep  precodeSELECT              [ChildMeasure]         , [ParentMeasure]              ON COLUMNS     , [Child].Children ON ROWS FROM     [MyCube] WHERE     [Time].[100] codepre  pWhen this query runs, the Child rows are correctly listed, alongside the appropriate measure values for Time ID 100.  Unfortunately, strongParentMeasurestrong is all the same, and appears to be an aggregate for this value over all Parents at Time ID 100.  I would expect this column to show the value from each childs associated parent at Time ID 100.p  pWhat am I doing wrong here  Do I need to create FactDimensions for each FactTable, and somehow relate those  Should I crate an association between Parent and Child in my Datasource view  Would that make it a Snowflake schema, which I think I am supposed to avoidp  pAs a side note, my ChildFact table actually contains ParentID as one of the measures, because it is on the relational table in the datasource probably due to some previous denormalization effort by the DB developer.  Should I remove any measures that are actually FKs in my fact table, or is that somehow required for what I am trying to dop

Negative 2794 pUsing iOS 6, Xcode 4.5.p  pI have a UIActivityIndicator that is on a UITableViewCell using dynamic prototype cells.  When I call startAnimating, the background color of the activity indicator is changing to transparent.  This occurs whether I create the activity indicator in the storyboard file or if I create the activity indicator programatically.  However, if I place an activity indicator on a normal view, the background color is not changed when I call startAnimating.p  pDoes anyone know what causes the change to a transparent background when animating on a TableViewCellp  pI can work around it if I set the background color back to what I want, but only after the indicator has actually started animating i.e. after the screen is redrawn at least once.  However, Id like to understand the cause if possible, or report it as a bug if there doesnt seem to be a logical explanation of why it occurs.p

So like an irresponsible C programmer that I am when Ive had too much coffee, I create a new file codeutilitymacros.hcode and add the following therep  precodedefine ldn UtilitylongDescriptiveName codepre  pNow I include codeutilitymacros.hcode in any code.cppcode where I use codeldn...code and my heart is filled with joy over how much more convinient it is to type 3 letters vs 28.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there a safer more proper way of doing this than with codedefinecodep  pIve noticed that I have to include utilitymacros.h after including boost headers, which I obviously dont like because its a sign of clashes though the Boost errors I get are not very clear as to what the clash is.p  pstrongClarification 1 On Code Readabilitystrongp  pIn case you might say that this negatively affects code readability, I assure you it does not, because its a small set of functions that are used A LOT. An example that is widely know is codestoicode for codestringToIntegercode. Another is codepdfcode for codeprobabilityDensityFunctioncode, etc. So if I want to do the following, codestoicode is more readable in my opinionp  precodeint x  stoia  stoib  stoic  stoid codepre  pThanp  precodeint x  UtilitystringToIntegera  UtilitystringToIntegerb          UtilitystringToIntegerc  UtilitystringToIntegerd codepre  pOrp  precodeint x  UtilitystringToIntegera x  UtilitystringToIntegerb x  UtilitystringToIntegerc x  UtilitystringToIntegerd codepre  pstrongClarification 2 Editor Macrostrongp  pI use Emacs as my IDE of choice and a Kinesis keyboard so you KNOW I use a ton of keyboard macros, custom keyboard shortcuts, as well as actually modifying what I see in the editor vs whats actually stored in the hcpp file. But still, I feel like the simplicity and visual readability as argued above of using a function abbreviation in a few select cases really is the result Im looking for this is certainly subject to a degree.p

I would like to   have a feature where I could remotely update the schedules from my mobile to her tablet .Now I am thinking of various possibilities to have the same set of data in both Tablet and Mobile for exampleAuthenticating the application with caretakers username and password requires checking data from SQLite table.Now how is it possible to have same set of SQLite data in both  mobile and tablet. Any update on SQLite table in tablet should also update the mobile SQLite database. I dont want any cloud service or third party apis. One way I think is have a PHP enabled server and have both devices integrated to it. Is there a way to have the tablet send data directly to mobile through HTTPOf course mobile should be connected to Wifi but that is finep

Negative 2794 pI am in the progress of trying to learn a few new tricks in order to better organize some of the sourcecode in my units in Delphi. I have noticed that some functions or methods I access appear to be classes inside classes, but I have not yet been successful in making a working class inside a class, although it compiles fine, I still get error messages when executing the code.p  pWhat I would like to do is to make kind of a tree with functions, procedures and values to set or get. I would be grateful if somebody could help me out a little bit with an example. I have today some classes that are Types. I then assign the types to a variable     somethingTSomething and Then for something to happen I write something.action.p  pMy aim is to go further, and define subfunctions orand subprocedures. Lets say I have three or four classes. TSnippet, TAction1, TAction2, TSubAction1, Etc. I would like to use or assign these to a single variable and use them likep  precodeSnippet.Action1.SubAction1.Organizeparam1,param2 Snippet.Action2.SubAction2.ReturnsSomeString Snippet.Action1.SubAction1.SomeProcedure codepre  pIs anybody able to help me with a useful example as in how to write code for this approach to work And also.. does anybydy know how such an implementation of code will affect CPYCycles needed in order to execute code versus the old fashioned method of having thousands of procedures with all different names, but more direct access it feels like more direct access.p  pAs of my first text was maybe a bit unclear, this follows. I would like to make use of the editors automatic suggestions of proceduresfunctions available in order to simplify programming a little bit. I started to make a Class for this, and it works great. Consider a classname Data. What can we do with data We can Edit, Add, Delete, Save and Load. Ok. This is my first Class.p  pConsider then another Class Encrypt. We can do DES, DES3, HASH, BITSHUFFLE. I can go on with a third Class Compress. We can do LZW, ZIP, RAR, MP3, MPG, MP4, etc.p  pInstead of using these as 3 different classes, I would like to combine them in one, yet keeping them separate. I would like to make a kind of an OwnerClass for the other classes. We can call this MyStuffp  pWhenever I type MyStuff. in the editor, I should get up a list of Data, Encrypt, Compress.  Further, When I then choose Compress, the next list for that class procedures and functions will list up.p  pThe classes may have some local variables, but the main functionality will be towards global arrays.p  pMaybe there are other ways of achieving this. I dont know. My basic aim is to be able to categorize and put together routines that belong together. This is already done in Units, but this does not help with the automatic list from the editor. Thank you in advance. Morten.p

Negative 2794 pstrong[C .NET Windows Form WMI]strongp  pIm pretty new at C, but I have experience with VBScript and Im trying to convert a script I wrote to C. Instead of just using a converter, Im rewriting the code and trying to optimize it in an attempt to help me learn.p  pstrongA little backgroundstrongp  pIn my original VBScript, I connect to a remote server once using this codep  precodeSet objSWbemLocator  CreateObjectWbemScripting.SWbemLocator Set objSWbemServices  objSWbemLocator.ConnectServerstrComputer, rootcimv2, strUserName, strPassword objSWbemServices.Security.ImpersonationLevel  wbemImpersonationLevelImpersonate codepre  pThen I loop through a list of printers Im looking for and call a function that has the following codep  precodeSet colPorts  objConnection.ExecQuerySELECT  FROM Win32Printer WHERE Name   amp strPrinter amp     If colPorts.Count  0 Then     Set objPort  objConnection.GetWin32TCPIPPrinterPort.SpawnInstance codepre  pAfter the instance is spawned, I add the properties I want to a Dictionary object that has a arbitrary string value with the printer Im searching for as the key and the property as  the value. So, by the time I disconnect from the server, I have a single dictionary object with all the printers I need to work with from that server I also do the same thing with the ports.p  pWith C, it doesnt look I will need to use a dictionary because I can use the ManagementObjectSearcher to return a ManagementObjectCollection. Then, if I understand this correctly, I should be able to obtain the properties I need for the specific printer I want from a single ManagementObject or drill down to a PropertyData. With me so farp  pstrongThe problemopportunitystrongp  pBecause Im returning the entire collection, I thought it would be more efficient for me to use LINQ to find the specific printer I need to work with instead of looping through the entire collection. Then, once I have the ManagementObject from LINQ, I could either assign the PropertyData to a variable for later use assuming thats possible or loop through the PropertyData to view the contents mostly for debugging.p  pIve tried the latter with the following code without any luckp  precodevar printer  from ManagementObject x in mocPrinters                       where x.Properties[Name].Value.ToString  MyHP                       select x  foreach PropertyData p in printer      MessageBox.Showstring.format0 1, p.Name, p.Value  codepre  pThe code above hasnt worked because, Im assuming, my printer isnt of type PropertyData.p  pstrongOther helpful infostrongp  pI thought that querying with LINQ after returning the entire collection would be faster than querying with WMIWQLs codeSELECT  FROM Win32Printer WHERE Name  MyHPcode, but if someone has tested this out and knows that the performance difference is negligible, Im content using WMIWQL Im not quite savvy enough as a programmer to test those things yet.p  pIf anyone has any pointers, I would appreciate it.

Negative 2794 pId like to accomplish the followingp  pI have a form represented in a JSP  lets call this codeinput.jspcode. This form submits to a servlet which will create objects in a DB  lets call this codeCreateServletcode. When the form is successfully submitted, the servlet should direct the user back to codeinput.jspcode and display a success message. When validation fails, it should redirect back to codeinput.jspcode, display an error message, retain the input values.p  pI can think of a few optionsp  ol lipOn validation failure I can use a codeRequestDispatchercode to perform a forward to codeinput.jspcode. This would allow me to easily display the validation errors and input parameters from the form. However, I know that a hrefhttpwww.javapractices.comtopicTopicAction.doId181 relnofollowa forward should not be used in the case of performing an edit operationa, so when the request is successful I should not do a forward and should do a redirect instead. The problem with a redirect is that I cant set attributes as easily unless I pass it in the URL, e.g. codeinput.jspsuccesstruecode.pli lipI can store validation messages, success messages, and input values in the session, and always perform a redirect. After the JSP has displayed the page then it can remove these attributes from the session.pli ol  pI am using plain servlets and JSP and not any framework like Struts.

The article statesp  blockquote   pPrograms often need these strings. TrueString and FalseString are a useful pair of readonly members. They represent truth values in string format. They provide indirection and abstraction over directly using string literals.p blockquote  pSo appearantly its useful for some situations.

Negative 2794 pMy question looks at first sight similar to others notably a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions572893cloninganonstandardsvnrepositorywithgitsvnCloning a NonStandard Svn Repository with GitSvna  but I have one additional problem. I am also aware of a hrefhttpjohn.albin.netgitgitsvnmigrate relnofollowhttpjohn.albin.netgitgitsvnmigratea .p  pSome of the branches that were created in the svn repository left out the toplevel directory in the trunk. So in the branch, all files appear to differ from the files in the trunk, merely because they are in a different location.p  pExample in one of the branches, the directory codetrunktopsrccode corresponds to codebranchesfoobarsrccode instead of the more usual codebranchesfoobartopsrccode. But there are also branches that use the second form.p  pNow when running codegit svn clonecode on this svn repository, it will retrace the full history of such branches and double all commits to them. On the trunk the commit will be for file codetopsrcfilecode and on the branch it will be for codesrcfilecode. Because the codegit svn fetchcode operation apparently isnt clever enough to detect this relocation, it will go back the full history prior to the creation of the branch and create new commits for the new location, going back all the way to the beginning of time, just so that it can create the files that are going into the branch.p  pSince there are a lot of branches, and the later ones have a lot of history, this is annoying situation, since each commit is doubled or tripled although from a cursory inspection it seems that the alternate location of each file is shared for somebutnotall prehistory of the branches that it later is going to occur in. And it really adds to the conversion time, too.p  pNow what Ive been thinking about to fix that is the following. What if it were possible to insert some hook in the code of codegit svn fetchcode it is a Perl script that would edit the paths of the files involved after it fetches them from svn, but before it commits them to git. If the pathname of a file would not contain the codetopcode directory, it would insert it, otherwise it would leave the name alone. This way I effectively rewrite history as we go along.p  pNow the following questions spring to mindp  ol liIs this a sane ideali liIf yes, how can I do itli liIf no, what else could I do The origin repository is still in use, so solutions that make it impossible or difficult to import future commits are unfortunately not helpful.li ol  pIn addition to this, I will start in a nonempty destination repository and skip the first part of the svn history. This is because the beginning was converted from cvs, where its tags from that time were converted in a rather strange and useless way, and I have already created a script to redo that part from scratch.p
Negative 2794 pI have an unbound text box that I want to enter a number in and then it would go in a form.  When I do this, I want to change the status of checkbox in another form as well.  So it is like inventory.  When I add this item to this box, I need the checkbox value to change because its no longer in inventory.  So the form I have is Info and the checkbox is named ChkboxAvailableUse.  I have the checkbox correlated to a kit number and location and stuff too.  So when I enter the number in an unbound text box called AssignKit, I want that number to look for the same kit number the Info form and the InvKitNumber text field, and then change that records checkbox ChkboxAvailableUse to change to false.  I hope this makes sense.  I have the line of code I thought would work below.  Any help would be fantastic.  Thank youp  precodeCurrentDb.Execute  UPDATE Info SET ChkboxAvailableUse  FALSE WHERE InvKitNumber   amp Me.AssignKit amp  codepre

Negative 2794 pWhats the best way to get a button to be capable of both a codeTouch Up Insidecode action and a codeTouch Down Repeatcode action  Kind of like the Home button on an iPhone one click goes to the home screen, but two rapid clicks opens the multitasking bar.  Right now my button has both methods hooked up, but the codeTouch Up Insidecode method unsurprisingly gets called before the codeTouch Down Repeatcode can happen.p  pI can come up with a few ways I might pull this off having the Touch Up Inside method wait a second to see if another click comes before executing, having a second button move invisibly into place after the first click, etc but they all seem kind of hacky and open to performance losses and bugs.  I found the codetapCountcode property, but its for UITouch instead of UIButton, so codeif[buttonAddItems tapCount] gt 1  else if[buttonAddItems tapCount]  1code, which seems like it would be the most efficient way of doing it, doesnt work.p  pIs there a bestpractice for this sort of thing  Or if not, does anyone have a preferred way of getting this donep

Negative 2794 pI noticed that sometimes, when I plot the bars using the functions bar or hist, the bars plotted have no border. They are a little bit less nice to see, and I would prefer the border or a little bit of space between them. The figure shows what I got now, plotting three different datasets. The third graph is zoomed in order to show the lack of space between bars.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMH2ua.png altenter image description herep  pI get there this has something to do with the histc parameters in bar function.

Negative 2794 pHedge  this could end up being a dumb newbie question, but if not it could be one of the more interesting posts today.p  pBasically, Im seeing that merely adding a Global.asax component to a web application causes the runtime to execute page requests serially, whereas web applications without a Global.asax process requests in parallel as expected.  Impact would be that scalability goes out the window if you use Global.asax  Im skeptical thats actually the case but am currently blocked on any better explanation.p  pHeres the scenariop  ol liCreate a new blank web application.li lipAdd a page that takes 5 seconds or so to complete.  I used the below but the exact method of delay doesnt seem to matterp  pDateTime PageStartTime  DateTime.Nowp  pwhile DateTime.Now lt PageStartTime.AddMilliseconds5000  System.Threading.Thread.Sleep0 pli lipAdd another page to use as a utility to reset the app domain.  This isnt strictly necessary to see the problem behavior but is helpful in repeating the testsp  pHttpRuntime.UnloadAppDomainpli lipAfter building, start a browser with one tab or window for the app domain reset, and 3 tabs or windows for the longrunning page.pli lipF5 the reset page, wait a sec, then F5 the 3 delay page tabs.  Youll see that as expected the 3 pages end about the same time, i.e. that theyre clearly running in parallel.  Run all the F5s you want and theyll still parallel as expected, presumably until the cows come home.pli lipBack to the project, add a Global Application Class Gloabl.asax component.  No need to add any code  mere presence of the component is the test basis.pli lipAfter building, return to browser and quickly F5 the 4 tabs.  Again, the longrunning pages parallel as expected, at least if you hit the 3 tabs fairly quickly.  Now for the good part  wait a sec until all complete, then without using the reset tab F5 the 3 delay pages again  youll see thatp  pa. The total time for all 3 to run is about 15 seconds  3 times longer than expected.  The pages appear to be processed serially, i.e. one after the other.p  pb. The order of completion for the second and third tabs is random, suggesting that ASP hasnt even decided which should run first until after the first request has completed.p  pc. If you reset unload the app domain, you get another chance to have the pages parallel, but after they complete that first cycle they go right back to serial execution.pli lipBack to the project, remove the Global.asax component, build, and retest  the page requests again parallel as expected for the longhaul.pli ol  pCool, ehp  pStuff I triedp  ol liVarious .Net versions  3.5 and 4,li liVarious web servers  WebDev, UltiDev, IIS,li liDifferent ways of delaying the page  real work, with and without yield, etc,li liBrowser usage  one browser window with multiple tabs, versus dedicated browser windows,li liCode placement  tried both page Load and PreRender events for delay code, . Other stuff now rolled off of grayhaired memory...li ol  pClearly the above isnt a representative or useful project, but I stumbled on this doing something that has both intentionally longrunning pages and an actual need for Global.asax  mainly for global static variables.  I imagine most normal web apps would run fast enough that few would notice if they reverted to sequential request execution, but this behavior sure broke mine  been hammering this for three days so any ideas most appreciatedp  pThanks, Davidp

Negative 2794 pUsing JGoodies FormLayoutp  pI have a Panel that contains a Salutation, a name and a forename. Lets call it NamePanel I now want to build another Panel that contains the first Panel and adds a few more rows. Lets call it NamedAddressPanel The layout of NamePanel looks like thisp  precodeSalutation  textfield  Name        textfield  ForeName    textfield codepre  pSo the bigger Panel builds itself by putting the small NamePanel in it and puts a few more rows below it. So it builds itself like thisp  precodeNamePanel  Street        textfield   Streetnumber  textfield codepre  pNow the problematic result of this looks like thisp  precodeSalutation  textfield  Name        textfield  ForeName    textfield   Street        textfield   Streetnumber  textfield codepre  pI want it to look like thisp  precodeSalutation    textfield  Name          textfield  ForeName      textfield   Street        textfield   Streetnumber  textfield codepre  pThe labels in the NamePanel will have a different width than the ones added below it in the NamedAddressPanel. They wont align with each other correctly because the NamePanel and the NamedAddressPanel use 2 different instances of FormLayout.p  pMy only solution to this currently is to use a fix width for the label column that is the same in all Panels. But that obviously breaks pretty easy when I add a label text that happens to be too long.p  pThe single other way I can think of is to somehow use the same Layout, but I want to split up Panels like this to make them reusable. I.e. I first had this as a single Panel but split it up because I need the NamePanel itself in one more place.p  pCan I somehow tell a FormLayout to negotiate a column width with another FormLayout Basically like setColumGroups but with multiple FormLayoutsp

Negative 2794 pBelow is the flow of my application p  pController  services  repositoryp  pAt the service layer we have transactional annotation We also have jparepository configuration where we specify the entity manager and txn manager. p  pMy doubt is I feel that the txn manager specified in jparepositories is considered and there is no impact of specifying trnsactional at service layer.  For eg  the service layer transactional can be mapped to custom txn manager where as the repository invoked by the service may have a different txn manager. In that case wont it create a problemp  pCan Somebody clarify do we ever need to put transactional at service layer when we are using jpa repository p

Negative 2794 pI am trying to wrap my head around starting to implement unit tests in a C project which makes use of AWS S3 buckets.p  pDespite only really looking into it briefly, I understand that almost anything that is external to the project must be mocked as to guarantee predictable results.p  pIn short I am trying to pass a static class which is both abstract and sealed as an argument which restricts the parameter to an interface I have defined at the moment only consisting of codeAWSClientFactory.CreateAmazonS3Clientstring, string, RegionEndpointcode.p  pHowever, I cannot figure out how to get this class passed by reference a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comsdkfornetlatestapidocshtmlTAmazonAWSClientFactory.htm relnofollowcodeAWSClientFactorycodea, and through extensive research, I dont see any way of doing so.p  pAs I am going to need to pass through cloud another provider which will imitate the S3 API through this same method, I would have thought this would have been an acceptable solution, to both this and passing mock classes implemented through the interface.p  pWhat would be the best way to implement this with the same sort of structure, whereby identical methods are called from different static classesp

You can let PHP do the unzipping, the string manipulation works fine as well codestrreplace...code, but when the codezipFolder...code function creates the archive, it cannot be opened, while it works fine if you create the archive manually with 7Zip, e.g..p  pstrongEdit 3strong I even got it working just by replacing the rezipping part in PHP with a call to 7Zip via codeexec...code.

Negative 2794 pSometimes, the answer is no. This turns out not to be a question, but more of a emcri de coeurem OK, just complaining. p  pThe Team Foundation Server 2010 PowerShell snapin exports a cmdlet called codeGetTfsPendingChangecode, which does what it sounds like. p  pIf there are no pending changes, codeGetTfsPendingChangecode echoes There are no pending changes. on standard output. I never asked it to. The following attempts at suppressing that output all failp  precodepcs  GetTfsPendingChange Server server foobar User envUSERNAME r   outnull  pcs  GetTfsPendingChange Server server foobar User envUSERNAME r   outnull  pcs  GetTfsPendingChange Server server foobar User envUSERNAME r  outnull codepre  pIm not getting errors, but the text output is not redirected. What IS redirected, is the emnormal successful output of the cmdletem, in the case where there are pending changes for it to return. The ONLY output you can suppress is the useful output. If there are zero pending changes, you get text garbage via codestdoutcode. If there are any actual pending changes, that stream of objects, not text can be redirected to the null device, but thats worse than useless. p  pSo it appears that text on stdout is a emside effectem from this cmdlet, not the cmdlets output, and it cannot be redirected in PowerShell. The PowerShell redirect operators codegtcode and codecode, without the fileno specifiers 2 in PS2, a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh847746.aspx relnofollow2, 3, 4, 5, and  in PS3PS4a, work on the strongobject streamstrong, which is strongnot codestdoutcodestrong. This would be fine if codestdoutcode had been replaced by this new object stream concept or if some genius on the TFS team hadnt decided that cmdlets should spew random text noise in all directions as a side effect. p  pThe garbage output definitely is on codestdoutcode, not codestderrcode. I can redirect the standard output of the whole script to codenulcode when I run it from codecmd.execode, and that works as expected, because duhp  precodecgtpowershell .tfstest.ps1 gt nul codepre  pHowever, I do not want to suppress all the output from the entire script. Just the output from one snapin cmdlet. Its not the end of the world, but its irritating to have random stuff that I call echoing garbage I have no control over. The script otherwise works correctly see UPDATE.p  pOne workaround would be to prefix everything I want to echo on codestdoutcode with some arbitrary string say codeKLUDGEPREFIXcode, and run the whole mess from a batch file which pipes the PowerShell scripts output through codefind v KLUDGEPREFIXcode and then through a PowerShell fragment that strips off the prefix from each line. p  pInstead, Im going to write the rest of the script around the problem so it looks like what they get is what I intended, because, in fact, I was going to tell them they didnt have any pending changes anyhow. Its been a valuable exercise, however, in terms of getting my head inside PowerShell. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong This script turned out to be fragile, unreliable, glacially slow, and impossible to run on any computer but the one where I originally wrote it. p  pI replaced it with a Perl script that took 110 the time to write, executed 10 times as fast, and does the same task better without any foolishness. PS and the TFS PS snapin are great ideas but they both need a lot of work before theyll be ready for release. p

Negative 2794 pI currently have a crystal report embedded in a visual studio website.

Negative 2794 pI have a custom class created for custom cells for my table view.  Theres UILabel for messages.  Im using storyboard to set the constraints, pinning the label to the top and right side of the table cell, I found that doing this causes the label to resize to fit the content.  Now I cant figure out how to add padding to the label because anything done in cellForRowAtIndexPath doesnt work since auto layout is selected.  Ive seen many examples that do CGRectMake with float values but they dont work and I think its because of auto layout.  Is there any solution for thisp  pIm not even sure what code to show for this...so here goes somethingp  pHow Im getting the height of the message...the cell is set for 220 width...cellForRowAtIndexPathp  precodestatic NSString cellIdentifier  chatCell ChatCell cell  ChatCell [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercellIdentifier]  if cell      cell  [[ChatCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifiercellIdentifier]  info  [receivedData objectAtIndexindexPath.row] message  [info objectForKeymessage] CGSize constraint  CGSizeMake220, 2000 CGRect rect  [message boundingRectWithSizeconstraint optionsNSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin attributesNSFontAttributeName[UIFont systemFontOfSize12.0f] contextnil] CGSize size  rect.size codepre  pWith that information, I set the table row heights in heightForRowAtIndexPath.

Is there a simple solution for this or do I have to rethink my entire codep  pANSWER What I did was add a UIView in storyboard and put its constraints to the bottom of the cell.  Since I was adjusting the cell height based on content bounds function from ios7, setting the constraint to the bottom automatically stretched the UIView all the way to the bottom.  Playing with the message label width, I got to have padding.  Hope this helps someone.p

Negative 2794 pI am supporting a C .asmx web service built on .NET 3.5. It is a very, very simple service that returns, among a few other things, a street address.

This means Latin foreign language characters can be stored accent marks, umlauts, etc and consequently returned in a web service response.p  pWhen I test the service locally using soapUIs automatically generated requests and without adding any special headers or any other intstructive information, I see this element exactly as its stored in the database  with its accent markp  precodeltCompositeStreetgt140146 RUE EUGNE DELACROIXltCompositeStreetgt codepre  pHowever, when a connecting system calls the service the IT staff report that the response contains the question mark typically used as the replacement for a nonsupported characterp  precodeltcompositeStreetgt140146 RUE EUGNE DELACROIXltcompositeStreetgt codepre  pstrongIm unsure whose issue this isstrong and Im concerned that the simplistic design of the service may mean that it falls on my shoulders to recode to somehow ensure any consumer is guaranteed to see the data in UTF8 encoding.

Please save the discussion about upgrading to WCF for another thread  its not in scope for this right now.p  pCan you have a look at the structure of the service and tell me if there is actually something that needs to be done on my side Code drastically slimmed down for the sake of this discussionp  pThe ASMX page  basically the WebMethod accepts a request and returns the responsep  precodenamespace Company.IT.Network.LocationStore.LSServices      using . . .

Negative 2794 pI wrote well, copied a Javascript image preload function and it seems to successfully preload my images when my page loads, but when the page actually needs to display the images, there is a delay during which it apparently loads them again, defeating the purpose of preloading. Possible causes of this behavior and fixesp  pI tried but failed to create reproducible code so I guess the cause of this is somewhere in the complexities of my whole project.  Heres the image preload function Im usingp  precodefunction preloadsources    var images  []   for i  0, length  sources.length i lt length i      images[i]  new Image     images[i].src  sources[i]     codepre  pI call this on a long array of images stored on our server when the page is loaded, and I can see a long list of GET requests in my console that seem to indicate its indeed preloading the images. Later, when the images are displayed within dynamically generated content using jQuery if it matters, there is a delay when they are loaded and I see another GET request in the console, with the status HTTP1.1 304 Not Modified.  So it looks like the images are being loaded again instead of using the cached version.  What could be causing thisp  pI do have some ajax calls occurring after image preload, before image display, with cache false in them  is that a possible cause However, these ajax calls dont directly affect the page content  they are just used to get database info which in turn affects the page content.p  pBy the way, I am using Firefox for testing. I read somewhere that Chrome at some time would send requests to see whether cached images had been modified but this is supposedly not an issue with Firefox.p

Negative 2794 pEach email in a list is to be sent to server and response to be be got from server that if it is a valid email.p  pSo after all emails are checked the array should have p  precodejoegmail.com  valid abcfjkdsl.com  invalid xyzyahoo.com  valid testnknk.com  invalid codepre  pThe code to send the emails to server in a loop is like p  precodeforvar i0 i lt isEmailValidList.length i    var isEmailValid  User.validateEmailemail  isEmailValidList[i].email, function       isEmailValidList[i].isValid  isEmailValid.value     codepre  pBut the problem is that the calls are asynchronous, so for say i0, the control will not go inside the function when i is 0.

Negative 2794 pI have a Windows Forms GUI that has a bunch of controls, one of which is a FlowLayoutPanel containing a group of RadioButtons.p  pI can tab to the first RadioButton TabIndex and TabStop set properly, but when I hit tab again it takes me to the next control on the form, not the next radio button in the FlowLayoutPanel.p  pOnce the first RadioButton has focus, the only way to go through the group is to use updown arrows, but that actually selects the RadioButton. Selecting a RadioButton kicks off some other stuff, so I just want a way to tab through the list to figure out what to select.p  pWhat I want, ideally, is to have each RadioButton act like any other control on the page and allow me to tab through the whole group without selecting a RadioButton until I hit Space.p  pThanksp

I have seen a a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions8483182emacsevilmodebestpracticedetailed answer to a general SO question about evila but all its suggestions and examples show how to map a key sequence to a single alreadydefined evil function. I cant see any examples where an existing evil key sequence is remapped to another possibly longer existing evil key sequence.p  pI guess I could replace the righthand side of the mapping with a sequence of existing evil functions, but Im not sure how one might do that. Or I could just use a basic emacs key remapping but I fear that this will interfere with evils different modesstates, or simply just wont work.p  pDoes anyone have any ideasp

Negative 2794 pI am using Gmaps4Rails to display a google map with markers.  I have the map working and it displays one red marker per address saved in my model.  I am trying to do something a little out of the ordinary, so heres the brief explanation of my goalsp  pWith most maps, one color per location on the map is fine.  For example, if you are listing restaurants on a map, you would make all of the markers for pizza red, Chinese blue, Hamburgers green, etc...  Unfortunately, this doesnt work in my case I need to have multiple colors per location.  Imagine if restaurants didnt fit nicely in one category If one restaurant may serve mexican, pizza and hamburgers  then, you need that location to have a red, blue and green marker.  This is where Im having problems.  p  pThe solution I have come up with is to add the base marker, then add each additional marker new color several pixels higher, so the user can see the top of each new colored marker.p  pIs this the best way to accomplish my goals  If so, where do I begin  Im not sure what to do  Gmaps4Rails makes this very easy, but I dont know what to do beyond the basics.p  pstrongrestaurantcontroller.rbstrongp  precodelocations  Location.searchparams[search].ordercreatedat desc  hash  Gmaps4rails.buildmarkerslocations do location, marker   marker.lat location.latitude   marker.lng location.longitude   marker.infowindow ltbgtlocation.nameltbgt                      ltbrgtltigtlocation.addressltigt                      ltbrgtltigtlocation.city location.state., location.zipltigt                      ltpgtlocation.services.mapservice service.name .join,                        ltpgtlta hreflocationpathlocationgtLocation Detailsltagt end codepre  pstrongmap.js.erbstrongp  precodelt Google Maps JS gt ltscript srchttpmaps.google.commapsapijsv3.13ampampsensorfalseampamplibrariesgeometry typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpgooglemapsutilitylibraryv3.googlecode.comsvntagsmarkerclustererplus2.0.14srcmarkerclustererpacked.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt  ltscript languagejavascript typetextjavascriptgt   handler  Gmaps.buildGoogle   handler.buildMap provider , internal id map, function     markers  handler.addMarkersltraw hash.tojson gt     handler.bounds.extendWithmarkers     handler.fitMapToBounds    ltscriptgt codepre

An original method to call external service was as below there are 3 of these all similar in total which I call in order from my GetInfoFromExternalService method note it isnt actually called that  just naming it for illustrationp  precode    private async Taskltstringgt GetTokenIdForCarsAsyncCar[] cars              try                      if externalpServiceClient  null                              externalpServiceClient  new ExternalServiceClientWSHttpBindingIExternalService                           string tokenId await externalpServiceClient .GetInfoForCarsAsynccars.ConfigureAwaitfalse              return tokenId                  catch Exception ex                      TODO plug in log 4 net              throw new ExceptionFailed  ex.Message                  finally                      CloseExternalServiceClientexternalpServiceClient             externalpServiceClient null               codepre  pSo that meant that when each async call had completed the finally block ran  the WCF client was closed and set to null and then newed up when another request was made.  This was working fine until a change needed to be made whereby if the number of cars passed in by User exceeds 1000 I create a Split Function and then call my GetInfoFromExternalService method in a WhenAll with each 1000  as belowp  precodeif cars.Count gt 1000                      const int packageSize  1000             var packages  SplitCarsscars, packageSize              kick off the number of split packages we got above in Parallel and await until they all complete             await Task.WhenAllpackages.SelectGetInfoFromExternalService           codepre  pHowever this now falls over as if I have 3000 cars the method call to GetTokenId news up the WCF service but the finally blocks closes it so the second batch of 1000 that is attempting to be run throws an exception.  If I remove the finally block the code works ok  but it is obviously not good practice to not be closing this WCF client.p  pI had tried putting it after my if else block where the cars.count is evaluated  but if a User uploads for e.g 2000 cars and that completes and runs in say 1 min  in the meantime as the user had control in the Webpage they could upload another 2000 or another User could upload and again it falls over with an Exception.p  pIs there a good way anyone can see to correctly close the External Service Clientp

Negative 2794 pI am trying to write the single search statement to search the Product Views in multiple ways.  My requirements are as followp  ol liIf SearchType is not provided, show all productsli liIf SearchType is strongProductIDstrong Integer, search by ProductIDli liIf SearchType is strongCodestrong VARCHAR50, search by Codeli ol  pHere is my TSQL script.  It works fine if I used, the ProductID which is Integer.  p  precodeDECLARE SearchType VARCHAR20  Code DECLARE Value1 VARCHAR50  XYZ123  SELECT      FROM     dbo.vProductsCurrent WHERE     SearchType IS NULL          OR SearchType  ProductID AND ProductID  Value1          OR SearchType  Code AND Code  Value1                      codepre  pBut when I changed it to search by strongCodestrong, I got the Conversion Failed Error.  I dont understand why it is executing ProductID check even though SearchType is strongCodestrong.  AFAIK, if the first condition returns false, it doesnt evaluate the remaining part of the query in AND conditions.p  precodeMsg 245, Level 16, State 1, Line 6 Conversion failed when converting the varchar value XYZ123 to data type int. codepre  pSo, I forced the ProductID to convert to Varchar10 before doing the searchp  precodeOR SearchType  ProductID AND CASTProductID AS VARCHAR10  Value1  codepre  pSince the data type of the ProductID is changed, the Indexing benefit of the ProductID no longer exists.  p  pIs there any better way to do thatp  pPS.  I dont want to use multiple If  Else ....  Actually my query has about 10 possible search conditions, and not only ProductID and Code.  I removed those for the question.p

As a last viewstate the user must be logged in order to save the order. So if user is not logged at this point, I redirect him to a login page.

Negative 2794 pI am implementing something like chat functions on Android using MQTT and took the available example from MQTT and changed it a little in order to have a Listener. The connection is established from AndroidClient to ActiveMQBrocker. As well I have a JbossServer with ResourceAdapteractivemq.rar and MDB in order to implement administrationcreate a new Topic at runtime etc.  on the Server side.p  pI have a question concerning the Listener and Publisher in AndroidClien . The Listener and subscription is set up. It works well, but only for the first message both ways sending from the Client to Topic and sending from the WebConsole to Topic.  On receiving of the second message occurs an error on Androidclient in Listener onFailure java.net.ProtocolException Command from server contained an invalid message id 2. The same error occurs, when I try to send the second message from Client. I attached my code.

Negative 2794 pRight now Im trying to parse a date thats written in a humanreadable format into a DateTime String that a SharePoint list will accept. In order to do this Ive determined that I need a String in a format similar to ISO that looks like code20070820T000000Zcode. It seems that SharePoint only accepts DateTimes that are in UTC with no milliseconds included for whatever reason, SharePoint gives errors and wont accept the DateTime when you include the milliseconds, so I need to convert my local time into a UTC time before converting it to the ISO string.p  pHeres the process that the code below is using.p  ol liFirst I use DateJS to parse my humandate into a JavaScript Date. Works fine, but apparently DateJS has been abandoned, so maybe I should change this to use MomentJS.li liNext I tried to create a new moment in UTC. This line is very, very wrong, and crashes my program. li liThen I have SPServices convert it into an ISO. SPServices drops the milliseconds off the DateTime so that SharePoint will accept it. Works fine.li ol  pIm sure there has to be a more elegantworking way to achieve this, instead of stitching together 3 different libraries. Im just not sure what it is.p  precodevar jScriptStartDate  Date.parse6292014 830am JS Date var jScriptStartDateUTC  momentjScriptStartDate.utc local date to UTC. var startDate  .SPServices.SPConvertDateToISO Sharepoint ISO 8601 format    dateToConvert jScriptStartDateUTC,    dateOffset  Sharepoint dates only accept UTC times, aka no dateOffset.  newItem.setitemEventDate, startDate EventDate is internal for StartTime codepre

Negative 2794 pI am having problems trying to find the FWHM of some data. I initially tried to fit a curve using codeinterpolate.interp1dcode. With this I was able to create a function that when I entered an x value it would return an interpolated y value. The issue is that I need the inverse of this functionality. In other words, I want to switch my independent and dependent variables. When I try to switch them, I get errors because the independent data has to be sorted. If I sort the data, I will lose the indexes, and therefore lose the shape of my graph.p  pI tried p  precodex  np.linspace0, line.shape[0], line.shape[0] self.xcurve  interpolate.interp1dx, y, linear codepre  pwhere codeycode is my data.p  pTo get the inverse, I triedp  precodeself.xcurve  interpolate.interp1dsortedy, x, linear codepre  pbut the values are off.p  pI then moved on and tried to use UnivariateSpline and get the roots to find the FWHM from this question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10582795findingthefullwidthhalfmaximumofapeakFinding the full width half maximum of a peaka, but the roots method keeps giving me an empty list code[]code.p  pThis is what I usedp  precodexcurve  interpolate.UnivariateSplinex, y r  xcurve.roots printr codepre  pHere is an image of the data with the UnivariateSplinep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrJe2k.png altData plotp  pAny ideas Thanks.p

Negative 2794 pI have a web application written in C .NET 3.5 using Visual Studio 2010 that consumes a web service exposed by Websphere for zOS. The web application is hosted on Windows Server 2008 64bitIIS 7. The first call to the WS takes 155000 ms to execute, but the service responded in less than one second verified on server. The subsequent calls to the WS takes about 45 ms. During the long running time, the worker process consumes all cpu and allocates more than 2Gb of memory. When it becomes responsive the memory allocated drop down to 250 Mb and subsequent calls take, as I said, about 45 ms. This behaviour doesnt happen on my workstation Windows 7 64 bit and on a server wtih Windows Server 2003 32 bit and IIS 6. I also tried to generate the serializersdeserializers with no effect. Any ideasp

Negative 2794 pI have been reading many blogs about Socket.IO these days and impressed by features of it.  I am planning to use it one of chat applications and for normal number of users with minimal number of users it is working perfectly. But are there any pitfalls in Socket.IO when used in production networks Is Socket.IO best fit for large scale messaging system where messaging flow will be very huge. If yes, what is the best technology stack to be used along Socket.IO to make it work 100 reliable even when load is more. Anyone have already have an experience with Socket.IO in implementing large scale messaging system.  Stack I want to use is Socket.IO, Redis, Cassandra and MySQL.p  pAs of now I have gone through many examples of Socket.IO and many people were trying to do in different ways. Some people used Array to store Socket ids while some using Redis. I understand that using Redis will help definitely. But I do not want to stop there. I would like to learn best architecture for Socket.IO application.p  pPlease suggest me a path to it. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pFor me best stack is nothing but, something for which rate of failure is less compared to others.p

Negative 2794 h2Introductionh2  pI have done a lot of research, today, and have learned a lot about hashes and encryption and the important difference between the two. One thing I have learned is this people disagree on the efficacy of salting. p  pIn the responses to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2188507helpwithsaltandpasswordsquestiona and particularly in the comments to the accepted answer, people conclude  it seems  that storing a randomly generated salt next to the hashed password in a database emisem the best way to secure passwords. There are several resources that state this and this will be the basis for my question. p  pIn this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8863946saltingpasswordsquestiona, the accepted answer states that with access to the all the possible hashed data values, the salt doesnt do much  conecptually  to make things anymore secure though, that would be an unfeasibly large amount of stored data. Salts and hashing algorithms serve the purpose of increasing the number of possibilities for a single password entry, making the use of a dictionarybased attack against a database exponentially less efficient here, I use the term dictionarybased more liberally, refering  really  to a table, whether that be a rainbow table, a table utilized for bruteforce attacks recomputing each time, or a simple lookup table.p  h2 The Bits and Pieces h2  pFrom my understanding, a well encrypted password needs three 3 thingsp  ol liTo be hashed. li liTo be hashed in conjunction with a salt. li liTo be hashed in conjunction with a random salt one salt for each password entryli ol  pIn order for  a cracker to understand the resulting stored hash, he or she needs four 4 things p  ol liKnowledge of the hashing algorithmli liKnowledge of the saltli liThe correct plaintext password value perhaps supplied as input from a dictionarybased attack running a dictionary through the algorithm in conjunction with the salt.li ol  h2The Security Bith2   pThe disagreement seems to surround what to do with the salt, i.e. where to store the salt. The phrase I keep seeing passes around Stack Overflow is security by obscurity  which appears to be the premise of a salt lets make this bit of information less seeable however, from my reading, I have come to understand that security by obscurity doesnt really work. The premise of which seems to be emif the attacker has access to the algorithm and  if provided  the salt, he or she can figure it outem. p  pThe premise, then, of security is not emsolelyem the mixing around and changing of the values, but the means the database, transactions, or server use of stopping the types of attacks that would p  ol liYield the salt to the attackerli liAllow the attacker to bruteforce the databaseli ol  pAnother user commented that it shouldnt matter if the code is exposed to the attacker as good code  or a good security algorithm  would prevent the attack from succeeding. p  pSo, security then is a combination of three 3 things p  ol liPreventing access to the server where everything is storedli liCreating an algorithm that prevents bruteforce entry to the database li liEncrypting transactional informationli liHashing obscuring sensitive data li ol  pThe concern over the efficacy salts seems to stem from the assumption that the attacker has access to the database, itself. p  pScenario Ive got a dictionary, your salt, and your hashing algorithm. Grabbing your password should be of no real trouble this is why we work to stop bruteforce attacks. p  pSo, my question as a result of these conclusions which are now on the Stack Overflow chopping block arep  h2 Questions h2  ol liDoes security also involve the protection of the location of the code, e.g. access to the hashing algorithmli liWhy does generating a random salt for each password matter, particularly if the database has been exposed, i.e. does salt randomness emreallyem add anything to the security of information Is this simply a matter of the exponential increase in time for an attack as a result of the random salt e.g. making an attack less appealingli ol  pstrongThe security of the salt seems to lie in the attacker not having it, not strictly its randomnessstrong p  ol start3 liWhy store the salt in a database, at allli ol  pEssentially, is all of this security stuff about the efficacy of hashes, etc. just myth Maybe I am just responding to the idea that nothing really will ever be entirely hacker proof we just do everything we can p  h3 Why I Am Motivated To Ask h3  pIt seems to me that if your database is exposed, the salt  random or not  doesnt matter, especially if the database stores the salt. p  pBest practice, then, would be twofold salts only adding a bit more security 1 the hashing of sensitive information 2 the protection  in the context of this question  of the database from bruteforce attacks. emThere seems to be a lot of misinformation floating around SOem some of it probably resides in my derived understandings, above. p  pHere, I am assuming guards against Crosssite Scripting, etc. are already in place. p

The application is in our F5 loadbalanced cloud environment. So we have multiple sites for different customers using the same load balancer. To make the SignalR calls serversside, we use the codeHubConnectioncode from the strongMicrosoft.ASPNET.SignalR.Clientstrong namespace and create a proxy like this full example a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewguidetotheapihubsapiguidenetclient relnofollowhereap  precodevar hubConnection  new HubConnectionhttpwww.contoso.com IHubProxy stockTickerHubProxy  hubConnection.CreateHubProxyStockTickerHub stockTickerHubProxy.OnltStockgtUpdateStockPrice, stock gt Console.WriteLineStock update for 0 new price 1, stock.Symbol, stock.Price await hubConnection.Start codepre  pWhere codehttpcontoso.comcode is the current customers site URL.p  pWe are looking to upgrade to the latest SignalR version 2.x and I am wondering if it is necessary to even use the codeHubConnectioncode.

So I am not sure if a handcrafted IGrouping would even allow that to exist.p  pThis is a working LINQPad example with type definitionp  precodevoid Main       ListltVertraggt vertrge  new ListltVertraggt     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga1,b1,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga2,b1,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga3,b1,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga4,b1,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga5,b1,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga6,b1,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga7,b1,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga1,b2,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga2,b2,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga3,b2,c,d,e     vertrge.Addnew Vertraga4,b2,c,d,e       Very easy first group     var vertrgeGruppiert  vertrge         .GroupByv gt new  v.Beginn, v.Ende, v.Vorlage, v.Ware      vertrgeGruppiert.Dump       Far more complex grouping     var maxInGroup  3     var vertrgeGruppiertMax  vertrge         .GroupByv gt new v.Beginn, v.Ende, v.Vorlage, v.Ware         .Selectg gt new                               Key  g.Key,                  Teile  g.Selectv,i gt new Value  v, Index  i                     .GroupByitem gt item.Index  maxInGroup                  vertrgeGruppiertMax.Dump       Transform back into simpler style      SelectMany used instead select, see comment in question     var vereinfacht  vertrgeGruppiertMax         .SelectManyvgm gt vgm.Teile             .Selectt gt new                                        vgm.Key,                      a  t.Selectx gt x.Value.ID                      vereinfacht.Dump   public class Vertrag       public Vertrag  Constructor         string id,         string beginn,         string ende,         string vorlage,         string ware              ID  id         Beginn  beginn         Ende  ende         Vorlage  vorlage         Ware  ware            Fields     public string ID  get private set      public string Beginn  get private set      public string Ende  get private set      public string Vorlage  get private set      public string Ware  get private set   codepre

Negative 2794 pI have an RGB image which is represented as a numpy array of size 500, 500, 3. I also have an array of size 500, 500 where each pixel has an integer value between 0 and 99 inclusive. This basically divides the image into many subregion. Pixels belonging to a subarray share the same integer index.p  pI am interested in doing some computations like computing the mean and standard deviation for each of these subsets. I can do this by looping over the image as follows to compute the mean for examplep  precode image is of size 500, 500, 3 gtRGB values  label is of size 500, 500 gt contains integers         import numpy as np  mean  np.zeros100, 3 for i in range0, 100     count  0     for x in range0,500         for y in range0,500             if label[x, y]  i                 mean[i, ]  image[x, y,]                 count  count  1       Compute the mean     if count gt 0         mean[i,]  count codepre  pThe way I am doing it includes lots of loops and it seems to be to be quite nonpythonic and I was wondering if there was a better in sense of speed way to do this.p

So I opened another terminal window and ran codesystemctl status mysqldcode, only to see that mysqld was again started.  But the error persists.  p  p3. I tried codefind  name mysql.sockcode but the response was codefind runusername1000gvfs Permission deniedcode.  p  p4. Then I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5530215mysqlproblemnomysqlsockthis postinga and tried codemysqladmin  grep d.sockcode but there were no results.  p  p5. I even resorted to codeyum remove mysqlcode followed by codeyum install mysqlcode, but then codemysql u rootcode still gives the same original error at top of this posting.  p  p6. And then I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions748478cannotfindmysqlsockthis other postinga, but codemysqladmin variablescode gives the same error that it cannot connect because the codemysql.sockcode cannot be found.   p  p7. And I tried codeln s tmpmysql.sock varmysqlmysql.sockcode but the same error persisted even though a link to mysql became visible when I tried codecd varlibmysqlcode and codels alcodep  p8. Since the problem may have to do with the fact that codesystemctl start mysqldcode gets hung up, I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20310782mysqldaemonfailedtostartcentos6this postinga and tried codechown R mysqlmysql varlibmysqlcode and codesystemctl start mysqldcode but the result is codeFailed to issue method call Unit mysqld.service failed to load No such file or directory.code  p  p9. I then read a hrefhttpdba.stackexchange.comquestions48777mysqlsockmissingthis postinga, which caused me to run codemysql help  grep Default options A 1code. The result printed the locations where codemysqlcode looks for codemy.cnfcode.  I thus checked every location, and there was no codemy.cnfcode file to be found. But I did find a codemysql.cnf.rpmsavecode, so I tried codemv mysql.cnf mysql.cnf.rmpsavecode.  This caused there to be a codemy.cnfcode in the expected directory, but codesystemctl status mysqldcode says that codemysqldcode is not found.  I tried codeyum install mysqlcode again, but it told me that codemysqlcode is already installed.  strongSo I suspect that the newly renamed codemy.cnfcode is corrupted.

So maybe some of my question is RTFM, although I have done a lot of permutations of Google, search IBM sites, etc., but no real joy closest answer link below.p  pPart of the question involves SAML I have a solid understanding of SAML from my Windows and security experience, but not of LTPAIBM. I have played around a little with DataPower and WebSphere security configuration.p  pI have a question similar to this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18428016howtodecryptltpatokenversion2How to decrypt LTPA token version 2a, and I believe I could solve my use case using this lowlevel technique.

Im told by my server infrastructure team who is told by IBM consultants that I should not flow the SAML all the way to WebSphere due to inefficiencies of memory in WebSphere for SAML tokens instead I should terminate SAML at DataPower and do a translated version of identity as LTPA from DataPower to WebSphere. One aside, is that really true That sucks Their reasoning has to do with how LTPA allows pinning a user session to a single WebSphere cluster member, thus avoiding memory overhead, whereas SAML does not according to them.p  pSo I will be translating all SAML Assertions at DataPower to LTPA keyvalue pairs.p  pI need to compare these keyvalue pairs against a custom permissions data format analogous to Windows Access Control Entries in a permissions evaluation service.

Negative 2794 pMy goal is to start preloading all of the website images for a large photo gallery website on the front page index.php without it being perceived by the user.  If the user clicks into the site home.php before all the images are loaded, which will definitely happen, the preloading process should continue invisible to the user.  And if the user clicks to other pages portfolio.php, etc. the preloading process again continues.  The idea is that hopefully with each new page, the process will not completely restart because many images will already be cached, and the user will not have to wait while all the images preload.p  pCurrently I am loading all of the images with html img elements that are inside a div with styledisplaynone.

Negative 2794 pWe need to partition a large, 0.5TB table specifically to free up space on the main .mdf file, and have implemented a solution for that, but there are a few issues Id like to ask about here. Ive never done partitioning before and just used a bunch of articles and references to get this to work, so please point out to me if and where Im going wrong with this, thanks. p  pFor one, it seems you need to create the partition with a clustered index or the actual data wont get transferred to the new partition filegroups. Is there a way to get around this, and what would be the potential benefits or disadvantages The table can very well be a heap anyway, since its only used to log information and only very seldom are there any queries retrieving data from it. We dont need a clustered index.p  pMore importantly, we want to make the operation as light as possible for transaction log space considerations as well as to minimize the maintenance window.p  pSo, is it possible and feasible and if, then how to create a partition with a nonclustered index while still transferring the physical data to the new partitionsp  pThe other question has to do with performance. I get varying degrees of results performancewise when comparing the same data in the same tables, where one is partitioned and the other is not. Index seeks take the same amount of resources and time, while scans seem to be heavier for the partitioned table relative how LITTLE data is fetched. So displaying the execution plan for a select top 10 ... on both tables, shows that the partitioned table takes 80 of the resources. While a top 1000 takes that down to 52, and seeks are exactly 50  50. How does that work exactly, and how can I use it to predict the behaviour in productionp  pThird and last question is how would you recommend we do this in an always on availability mode Id imagine it would be best to disable always on availability during the changes, and then just backup and restore the updated DB to the other replicas and resync. Again, if theres a lighter way to do it that you know of that doesnt include tearing it all down for half a day, all the better. p  pCurrently the partitioning script follows the following idea, please point out if Im missing some crucial steps herep  precode Dropping indexes to lighten up the load on log DROP INDEX RANDNONCLUSIDX ON MYTABLE ALTER TABLE MYTABLE DROP CONSTRAINT MYTABLEPK   Creating filegroups ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILEGROUP PrtFG0 ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILEGROUP PrtFG1 ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILEGROUP PrtFG2 ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILEGROUP PrtFG3   Creating files ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILE NAME  PrtFG0, FILENAME  C...PrtFG0.ndf, SIZE  10MB, MAXSIZE  unlimited, FILEGROWTH  1000MB TO FILEGROUP PrtFG0 ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILE NAME  PrtFG1, FILENAME  C...PrtFG1.ndf, SIZE  10MB, MAXSIZE  unlimited, FILEGROWTH  1000MB TO FILEGROUP PrtFG1 ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILE NAME  PrtFG2, FILENAME  C...PrtFG2.ndf, SIZE  10MB, MAXSIZE  unlimited, FILEGROWTH  1000MB TO FILEGROUP PrtFG2 ALTER DATABASE PartitionTest ADD FILE NAME  PrtFG3, FILENAME  C...PrtFG3.ndf, SIZE  10MB, MAXSIZE  unlimited, FILEGROWTH  1000MB TO FILEGROUP PrtFG3   Creating the partitioning objects, using them and finally putting back the PK constraint and dropped nonclustered index CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION MYTABLEPF INT AS RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES 250001, 500001  CREATE PARTITION SCHEME MYTABLEPFRANGEPS     AS PARTITION MYTABLEPF     TO PrtFG1, PrtFG2, PrtFG3  CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX MYTABLEPARTITIONIDX ON MYTABLE MYTABLEID ON MYTABLERANGEPSMYTABLEID  ALTER TABLE MYTABLE ADD  CONSTRAINT MYTABLEPK PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED MYTABLEID ASC   CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX RANDNONCLUSIDX ON MYTABLE RANDCOLID codepre

Use bubble sort on both sides of the pivot to finish the algorithm. codepre  pNow, heres my problem with my own algorithm. Its On up until I get to the bubble sort, which makes it On2. p  pMy specific question is What would be a better approach for this and still keep it as On Or if possible Olog n  Answers could be in pseudocode, but you chose to code for the answer, I prefer it be in Java.p  pNote The array is an integer array.

Negative 2794 pIm trying to learn about vectorization by studying simple C code compiled in emgccem with O3 optimization. More specifically, how well compilers vectorize. It is a personal journey towards being able to verify emgcc O3em performance with more complex computation.  I understand that conventional wisdom is that compilers are better than people, but I never take such wisdom for granted.   p  pIn my first simple test, though, Im finding some of the choices emgccem makes quite strange and, quite honestly, grossly negligent in terms of optimization.  Im willing to assume there is something the compiler is purposeful and knows something about the CPU Intel i52557M in this case that I do not.  But I need some confirmation from knowledgeable people. p  pMy simple test code segment isp  precodeint i float a[100]  for i0ilt100i a[i] float ii codepre  pThe resulting assembly code segment that corresponds to the forloop is as followsp  precode.L6                         loop starts here     movdqa  xmm0, xmm1       copy packed integers in xmm1 to xmm0 .L3     movdqa  xmm1, xmm0       wait, what  WHY  this is redundant.     cvtdq2ps    xmm0, xmm0   convert integers to float     add rax, 16              increment memory pointer for next iteration     mulps   xmm0, xmm0       pack square all integers in xmm0     paddd   xmm1, xmm2       pack increment all integers by 4      movaps  XMMWORD PTR [rax16], xmm0    store result      cmp rax, rdx             test loop termination     jne .L6                  codepre  pI understand all the steps, and computationally, all of it makes sense.  What I dont understand, though, is emgccem choosing to incorporate in the iterative loop a step to load strongxmm1strong with strongxmm0strong right after strongxmm0strong was loaded with strongxmm1strong.  i.e.  p  precode .L6         movdqa  xmm0, xmm1       loop starts here  .L3         movdqa  xmm1, xmm0       grrr  codepre  pThis alone makes me question the sanity of the optimizer.  Obviously, the extra MOVDQA does not disturb data, but at facevalue, it would seems grossly negligent on the part of emgccem.p  pEarlier in the assembly code not shown, strongxmm0strong and strongxmm2strong are initialized to some value meaningful for vectorization, so obviously, at the onset of the loop, the code has to skip the first MOVDQA. But why doesnt emgccem simply rearrange, as shown below.p  precode.L3         movdqa  xmm1, xmm0      initialize xmm1 PRIOR to loop .L6         movdqa  xmm0, xmm1      loop starts here  codepre  pOr even better, simply initialize strongxmm1strong instead of strongxmm0strong and dump the MOVDQA strongxmm1strong, strongxmm0strong step altogetherp  pI am prepared to believe that the CPU is smart enough to skip the redundant step or something like that, but how can I trust emgccem to fully optimize complex code, if it can even get this simple code right  Or can someone provide a sound explanation that would give me faith that emgcc O3em is good stuffp

Negative 2794 pHeres how my app works, so you understand my needp  pIn my app the user has data in a form. Next to it there is a map presenting the data of those data fields that contain GeoJson in vector layers a layer for every geometry field. These fields are also included in the form and the user can change the data either in the form or in the map.p  pThere is a select interaction in the map and when the user navigates to a dataset, its geometries are selected on the map.p  pWhen the user changes the geometry in an form input, a function updates the corresponding features geometry in the map. So if the user changes the coordinates of a point, this point then moves in the map. But as this feature can be selected and usually is, the selectInteractions corresponding feature has to be updated also. Otherwise the selection mark remains at the last position.p  pOf course I could have the function moving the vector layers feature simply move the selection interactions feature too and I do it but consider it a hack. It would be more elegant if the selection interactions features coordinates would be bound to the vector layers corresponding features coordinates.p  pOh, and thinking of it It would be even more elegant, if both te vector layers features coordinates and the select interactions features coordinates could be bound to the corresponding model objects coordinates.p  pIn the ol3docs for ol.Object a hrefhttpopenlayers.orgenv3.3.0apidocol.Object.html relnofollowhttpopenlayers.orgenv3.3.0apidocol.Object.htmla I found bindTo. It sounds perfect. The docs tell to See bindTo method for more details. Only No method bindTo is listed in the docs for ol.Object. And Ive only found an example on binding to htmldivs a hrefhttperilem.netol3rotationanchorexamplesbindinput.html relnofollowhttperilem.netol3rotationanchorexamplesbindinput.htmla.p  pSo the questions arep  ol liCan the coordinates of a select interaction feature be bound to the coordinates of a vector layer featureli liCan the coordinates of a vector layer be bound to the corresponding values of a javascript object used as modelli liHow would this be doneli ol  phelp is much appreciatedp  pAlexp

Negative 2794 pI have a few IP cameras that stream 720 X264 video over rtsp. The streams are really unreliable when viewing on Android. They also fail if more then 2 connections are made. p  pI have a ubuntu server that I can use to connect and restream as mjpeg or something else. There are tons of different commands out there but they all seem to involve transcoding the video. p  pHow can I simply restream the live rtsp feed as a mjpeg without doing anything to the video itself Theres no audio so no worries there. p

Negative 2794 pI have an application called NinjaTrader that uses .Net 3.5.  I have a Strategy that will send order information to a .dll written in .Net 3.5.  I need to send this order information to a platform called T4 that currently uses .Net 4.0.  I thought about using C as my .dll however everything still seems to target some .Net assembly.  I am currently using a asynchronous client server connection that does a decent job.  I just think it would be better to just run it through a .dll or something.  Does anybody have any ideas of the most stable solutionp

Negative 2794 pI built an android app that is called from the browser precisely from an input type file element, this app will record a sound and after recording the app should return and set the path of the recorded file to the caller input type file. My android app is launched successfully, and records the sounds, the file are stored in the external sd card, and of course I can play the recorded files, the problem I have is that the app never returns the path of the recorded file, it returns a path of a file with a name generated by timestamp and other code, with JPG extension, and with 0 bytes of length, not sure why JPG I dont use camera for anything. I know that this solution will work only in Chrome starting some versions of Android, I need a solution like this. Can you please help me why it is returning a JPG file of 0 bytes instead of the path of the recorded file with extension 3gp, tell me what Im doing wrong.

Negative 2794 pFor a current project, were using Olingo on top of hibernate, and picketlink for security and roles.p  pUsers with different roles will have different permissions which affects read  write access to certain properties. Consider the following examplep  ul liOne entity Person with the properties name, address and salaryli liTwo Roles  Employee and Managerli ul  pWhile the employee should be able to edit his own address, he certainly cant be allowed to change his salary or another persons address. And while he might be allowed to see his own salary and maybe another users address, he wont be allowed to even see the salary of others, let alone edit it. The manager on the other hand has full readwrite permissions.p  pThis is not a problem on the backend  we can use custom bean validation there to enforce write permissions.p  pBut I want the frontend to be able to reflect the users rights  by disabling the salary text field for example or by not displaying it in the first place.p  pFor that purpose Id like to introduce custom attributes based on user permissions into the oData meta model. Instead ofp  precodeltProperty NameAddress TypeEdm.String Nullablefalsegt codepre  pId like to receivep  precodeltProperty NameAddress TypeEdm.String Nullablefalse Modereadwritegt codepre  pOr something to the same effect.p  pSo the question is How do I introduce custom attributes into my oData meta model with Olingop  pPlease do not take the above example too serious. I do realize that simply telling the interface kindly not to show the salary of others via the meta model is inherently insecure p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pOk, its not that easy. I realize that now. The attributes I mentioned earlier are called facets in a hrefhttpwww.odata.orgdocumentationodataversion30commonschemadefinitionlanguagecsdl relnofollowCDSLa upon which oData rests pun intended and as it turns out, there is a fixed set of facet types. Consequently, Olingo doesnt bother much with abstraction here, youll find lots of hardcoded stuff instead. I guess it would be still possible to add another facet type, but that would require touching Olingo in many places. And it would eliminate conformity with CDSL  oData  which I wouldnt care about much but which may explain the lack of solutions to the problem.p  pFor now it looks like Ill have to either try and introduce another facet, or to intercept and modify the outgoing xml.p  pIm not to enthusiastic about either option, so... Any hint towards a better solution would still be more than welcomep

Negative 2794 pI have to provision a bunch of development vagrantboxes installed on different physical computers OS X, Win, Ubuntu with Ansible. As long as all ansible playbooksrolestemplates are unified prod, dev and stored in git, using ansiblepull and dealing with prod configs and vault that stores a real passwords is not an option. So the idea is to make every vagrantbox to create a reverse ssh tunnel to some server where ansibleplaybook will be applied to a range of ports. The question is how to pick a free port from vagrantbox so I dont have to hardcode numbers to each VM created by developers Another question is there any other, less complicated way to provision vagrant VMs working on different OSp

Negative 2794 pI am trying to extract the 3D coordinates of an object using the Kinect for Windows camera. The object to be extracted will be highlighted either with a vivid color, or graphic that can be recognized using feature extraction.p  pI have used MATLAB and Kinect for both feature extraction and 3D coordinate extraction before, however I am having a problem trying to merge the techniques together.p  pA really simple way to highlight the object, and extract it as a feature in a 2D image is to draw 5 circles really close to each other on the object, Then put it view of the camera and use codeCenterCoords  imfindcirclesimage, [15 20]code to extract the coordinates of all circles within a radius range in the image. You can then remove all circles in the image that dont have 5 similar circles in there immediate proximity, and extract the coordinate of the center circle.p  pBut how can I extend this idea to 3D How can I extract the 3D coordinates of a highlighted object using the Kinect Camera p

Negative 2794 pIn my app I have a codeUITableViewcode which has rows of data. Each row has different data based on the data source. Some rows have UITextViews  when a user selects such a UITextView, I display a pop up codeUITableViewcode right below the row. The codeUITableViewcode contains supplementary information, and the  of rows in the pop up codeUITableViewcode differs.p  pstrongMy problem is that in the codeUITableViewcode pop up, I cannot touch or scroll it. Touches or scrolls go to the underlying, parent codeUITableViewcode.strongp  pIve boiled it down to the followingp  pIf I add the pop up codeUITableViewcode as a subview of the parent codeUITableViewcode, the interaction works, but the layout is wrong because I do not know how to calculate the correct offset based on the row selected. Also when the parent codeUITableViewcode scrolls, the pop up does not. I therefore did not pursue this path.p  pIf I add the pop up codeUITableViewcode as a subview using codeaddSubViewcode of the codeUITableViewCellcode for each row, the layout is all correct including the scrolling but the interaction does not work as I described above.p  pNote that I set codeuserInteractionEnabledcode to true for the pop up codeUITableViewcode.p  pWhat is the correct way to get user interaction for my pop up codeUITableViewcodep

Negative 2794 pI have an abstract base class, which serves the purpose of allowing an array of pointers to a base class to be created. Useful for many things...p  pMy abstract base class contains no member functions. Therefore there are no pure virtual methods, and therefore I guess it is not technically abstract.p  pHowever, I do not want to be able to create an instance of this class.p  pIs it possible to create a memberless abstract base class If not, is there another resolution to preventing an instance of my abstract base from being created Will making the constructor codeprotectedcode sufficep  pIt has been pointed out to me that actually, an abstract base class would not be required if the purpose of that class was to allow a vector or array of pointers to the base class to be created  one could simply not have a base class and use as the base class the class at the top of the inheritance hierarchy. Alternatively, one could copy and paste that top class and exchange the implemented methods for pure virtual functions with no implementation, however this seems logically inconstant with the idea of abstract base pointers, and would lead to more difficult to maintain code.p

Negative 2794 pI want to run multiple spiders to crawl many different websites. Websites I want to crawl take different time to be scraped some take about 24h, others 4h, .... I have multiple workers less than the number of websites to launch scrapy and a queue where I put the websites I want to crawl. Once a worker has finished crawling a website, the website goes back to the queue waiting for a worker to be available to launch scrapy, and so on.  The problem is that small website will be crawled more times than big ones and I want all websites to be crawled the same number of time.p  pI was thinking about using RabbitMQ for queue management and to prioritise some websites. But when I search for RabbitMQ, it is often used with Celery. What I understood about these tools is that Celery will allow to launch some code depending on a schedule and RabbitMQ will use message and queues to define the execution order.p  pIn my case, I dont know if using only RabbitMQ without Celery will work. Also, is using RabbitMQ helpful for my problemp  pThanksp

Negative 2794 pAs stated, how should we properly save a captured signature using SignaturePad component to a SQL Server database Well it should be easy, considering the GetImagefalse method used by the component returns a Bitmap and later on compress the Bitmap into a JPEG and into an array byte using a Stream. The byte array should then be saved directly to the SQL Server database however, the problem with this approach is that when you retrieve the image from the database, the image is all black.

Negative 2794 pThe short version I have a database that I have presorted 30 ArrayLists corresponding to 15 columns. 15 are presorted ascending, 15 are presorted descending lColumn1, lColumn2, lColumn3 ... rColumn1, rColumn2, rColumn3 the preceding l lets me know its a list, the preceding r tells me its a reverse list. So rColumn3 tells me this ListArray has Column 3 sorted in descending order.p  pWhen I click on the column header, I dont need or want any of the default sorting methods, including the updown arrows. All I need is to Override the default behavior so that when I click on a column headerp  ol liThe table column header click accesses my method which determines whichli liListArray to load into the table and then li liloads that array as an ObservableList.li ol  pI have working code for parts 2 and 3 above.

Before editing, each line is a string containing both numbers and strings, which, when broken down into cells, many cells contain both 25, or 87, etc. To sort most of the table properly, I have to first remove the letter characters and then compare the resulting numbers so I can sort them as a number instead of as a string.

Negative 2794 pIn a highchart highstock object, I want to understand the difference between chart.options.yAxis and chart.yAxis.p  pWhen I add a yaxis to the chart I see an object getting added to both the places. It also removes from both the places if I remove an axis. I see a discrepancy when using navigator, as chart.yAxis contains an object for navigator whereas chart.options.yAxis does not contain an object for navigator. p  pMy doubt is how should I update yAaxis dynamically  Here is a scenario My chart loads with 2 yAxis. So the chart.YAxis array contains the 2 yAxis I loaded the chart with plus an object for the navigator total 3. Now, when I add another axis dynamically using chart.addAxis it becomes the 4th index in chart.yAxis and the 3rd index in chart.options.yAxis. Which index should I be using if I want to update this new axis dynamically using chart.yAxis[].update. p  pNote that now if I update the axis using the 4th index chart.yAxis[3].update it adds another item in the chart.options.yAxis array, hence now chart.options.yAxis contains 2 items for the same axis.p

Negative 2794 pstrongMy general questionstrong is in a MVC patterned web app, what is the preferred way to scope and then update a bean after a request  I see 3 primary ways to go about itp  p1 When the model is initially loaded, store it as a bean in the session.  The user makes changes in the view, sends request. The controller grabs the bean from the session and from the request gets all the parameters that have new bean data, updates the bean with its setters, sends the bean to the service layer to be saved.p  p2 Rebuild the bean from scratch only with request data Model is initially loaded, bean is request scoped, and the view puts the beanID into one of its form fields along with all other relevant bean properties, user changes data and sends request, controller gets the beans id and all bean properties to be updated from the request and then builds a new bean from these and sends this object to the service to be saved.p  p3 same as 2 but after the request, controller makes 1 call to service layer with just the beanID that returns a complete bean that is an unaltered state, update the bean with the parameters retrieved from the request, send the updated bean back to the service layer for saving.p  pI want to use the first option because it seems like the easiest to implement and would be less taxing on the database.  The second option would have less concurrency problems but it seems clunky to have to rebuild the bean from scratch, especially if there are bean properties that arent relevant for this view that I would have to put in hidden fields so I could rebuild it accurately.  The third options seems like overkill but thorough.p  pstrongThe details of the site in questionstrong I am building a Java web app and trying to follow the MVC pattern. The basic functionality of the app is for managers to create plans for helping employees accomplish mutually agreed upon goals.  The plan will contain different stages involved in accomplishing the overall goal and each stage will have specific tasks for completing the stage so tasks are nested in stages which are nested in a plan. So the manager will build a plan and deploy it to the employee. Then the employee signs in, logs activity and marks task complete as heshe finishes them.  The manager may occasionally modify the employees plan but the idea is that they would be collaborating on any changes to the plan after it was deployed.  The manager can also run analytics on the employees data but that wouldnt actually change the employees data or the structure of the plan.p  pSo, given that the employee is almost always going to be the only one who is accessing the data for hisher plans, I do not anticipate many issues where more than 1 person will be accessing data at the same time.  That being said, I dont want to limit the site from growing should the requirements change and need more thread safety.  I also want to use good coding practices to make it easier for others to improve and maintain the site.p  pThanks for any feedback.

I believe this is happening because the arrays used in the tutorial is a different type compared to the ones I have used.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pFirstly, the main issue was that the fact I had a different type of an array compared to the tutorial so I had changed the codevar filteredAnimal  [String]code to codevar filteredArray  [[StringAnyObject]]code since the data sourceJSON file had numerous arrays of data. And treat it as AnyObject due to that, which then allowed me to call the specific information from the JSON file.p  pThe reason why I was returned with an empty array was because I did not assign the searched values in the empty array within the codeupdateSearchResultsControllercode method, so I had added the following just before reloading the table data  codefilteredArray  arrays as [[StringAnyObject]]codep  pThis still did not solve the issue as I had to change the if statement within the codenumberOfRowsInSectioncode from codetableView  self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableViewcode to codeself.resultSearchController.activecode, which then retrieved me an actual result.p  pHowever the search itself is still not working, but majority of the issues have been resolved. When tapping the search bar, it only retrieves the final index of the array, and when searching anything, it removes the value. I will continue to work on it and hopefully resolve the matter soon. Thanks for the help so farp
