Negative 78022 pI have a WCF service that sometimes has to return a Fault. For some reason, the calls to my service begins to time out with the following error The request channel timed out while waiting for a reply after 000059.8906201. Increase the timeout value passed to the call to Request or increase the SendTimeout value on the Binding. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.p  pAfter examining the problem, a pattern emerged When the service had returned a fault 10 times, the timeout starts. So I created a testservice implemented byp  precodepublic string GetDataint value      throw new FaultExceptionA testerror occured  codepre  pAnd a testclientp  precode   protected void RunTestGetData              using TestServiceReference.Service1Client client              new WSPerformanceTester.TestServiceReference.Service1Client                      try                              client.GetData1                 client.Close                 outputWriter.WriteLinestring.FormatCall run in thread 0 GetData, Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId                 outputWriter.Flush                          catch Exception e                              client.Abort                 client.Close                 outputWriter.WriteLinestring.FormatError occured in thread 0 GetData 1, Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId, e.Message                 outputWriter.Flush                            codepre  pThis only happens, when the service is returning a FaultException. If I throw a normal exception, the service is able to continue running after the 10th call.

However this method can get quite ugly columns stretching outside page bounds if there are quite a few columns and quite a few rows, and is a bit tedious to use.p  pWhat would be a good way to display this form to the userp

Negative 78022 pFirst of all, I emloveem ASP.NET MVC. This question is not a criticism of it. Rather, I want to confirm what I think I see and make sure I havent missed something. Bear with me ... I cant get to the question without providing a little bit of context.p  pThe question has to do with returning data in a Stream in response to an HTTP Post. In the olden days before ASP.NET MVC, you could do this by piping your data directly into the Response stream. For example, you might do something like this p  precodesomeObjectThatDumpsOutputToWhateverStreamYouHandIt.WriteToResponse.OutputStream  codepre  pNotice a key aspect of this code I have not implemented emANYem backing store. I did not have to stream the info to a byte array, or dump it into a temporary file. Rather, ASP.NET had already set up a Stream for the purpose of communicating the response back to the browser, and I have dumped the output I want directly into that Stream. This is more efficient in terms of CPU, memory, and execution time than copying all the data to some temporary location and then moving it into the Response stream.p  pHowever, it is not very friendly to unit tests. In fact, you can still do that kind of code in ASP.NET MVC, but the custom would be to avoid that. Rather, ASP.NET MVC would encourage you to return an ActionResult. The ActionResult is an ASP.NET MVC concept that exists mostly to be unit test friendly. It allows you to declare what you want done. A unit test can exercise a Controller action and confirm that it gets the expected ActionResult. That unit test can run outside a browser.p  pASP.NET MVC offers a kind of ActionResult for returning Streams of data. It is called FileStreamResult. Dont let the word File in the name fool you. It is about returning a Stream of data, exactly as we are talking about above.p  pHowever, heres the problem, and the basis of my question strongIf you make your Controller method return a FileStreamResult, and you hand it a Stream that you want to return, then it appears there is no longer any way for you to dump the data directly to the Response stream.strong Now, it appears you are forced to make your own Stream with a backing store such as memory or a file, dump your data into it, and then hand that Stream to the FileStreamResult that you return.p  pSo it appears I have to do something like this intentionally omitting dispose  using  etc.p  precodeMemoryStream myIntermediateStream  new MemoryStream someObjectThatDumpsOutputToWhateverStreamYouHandIt.WriteTomyIntermediateStream    return new FileStreamResultmyIntermediateStream, applicationpdf codepre  pNotice that myIntermediateStream causes the contents of the large stream of data to be stored in memory temporarily, so that the FileStreamResult can later on copy it again into the Response output stream.p  pstrongSo heres my question Have I overlooked something, or is it accurate to say that using FileStreamResult forces you to have an intermediate storage location that you would not be forced to have if you were to write directly to the Responses output streamstrongp  pThanks.p
Negative 78022 pI have an archive object which manages various byte arrays and hands out a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavaioInputStream.html relnofollowcodeInputStreamcodeas and a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavaioInputStream.html relnofollowcodeOutputStreamcodeas for reading and writing them. Each byte array has an associated a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavase6docsapijavautilconcurrentlocksReentrantReadWriteLock.html relnofollowcodeReentrantReadWriteLockcodea. p  pThe constructor of the subclass of codeInputStreamcode which the archive produces acquires the lock for the relevant data, while codeclosecode releases the lock. Now, the problemp  pSuppose that I have a task which will run on another thread which needs input from the archive, is given the codeInputStreamcode as an argument before it starts, and is responsible for closing the stream when its finished. These requirements appear to be incompatible with the locking mechanism used by my data archive, because p  ol liThe codeInputStreamcode is created on a different thread from the one on which it is closed.li liA codeReentrantReadWriteLockcode must be released by the thread which owns it.li ol  pRewriting the parts of the program which expect an codeInputStreamcode as input in order to avoid 1 is inconvenient and makes those parts less flexible. Using a kind of lock which permits change of ownership would let me avoid 2, but I dont see any locks in the Java API which can handle that and Im not terribly keen on knocking together a custom lock if  I dont have to.p  pWhat solutions are there to this problemp

Negative 78022 pI have been watching the Google IO presentation by Virgil Dobjanschi on the correct way to implement REST on Android with services and content providers.  a hrefhttpcode.google.comeventsio2010sessionsdevelopingRESTfulandroidapps.htmlhttpcode.google.comeventsio2010sessionsdevelopingRESTfulandroidapps.htmlap  pBased on the video Im doing things the wrong way, which is not surprising given how hard the right way is. Anyway, having been shown the promised land in the video Im having a bit of a problem figuring out how to get there.p  pI have most of it nailed but the one thing thats defeating me is the Binder Callback that Virgil references in the slides see link above, on page 43 it shows step 2 as starting the service with startService intent  and step 10 as returning status information using a Binder Callback. There is no example code anywhere in the presentation which is rather frustrating. There is talk of open sourcing the Twitter client which apparently uses this approach but nothing yet and the announcement was in April.p  pIn the video he states What is a binder callback A binder callback, think of it as an interface that was passed in the request intent.p  pI have searched all over the place but have not been able to find any doc or examples that show how to pass a callback as part of an intent. Nor can I figure out any other way of passing in a callback.p  pI thought he may be referring to binding to the service and implementing the callback that way. However, he is specifically referring to a local service and using strarSerice and not bindService. Also with bindService the service will be destroyed if the activity is destroyed which defeats the idea. The workaround is to use startService and then bindService and leave the service running for the duration. The other problem with bindService is that the callback can not be use until onServiceConnected completes which complicates the code even further as the action instructions can not be passed in the intent because the return callback may not be in place in time to return the results.p  pIm only interested in implementing this using the recommended approach. Can anyone shed an light on what a Binder Callback is and how to code it up. Also related to this, does anyone know what a Service Helper would look like apart from binge a singletonp  pAny help here would be much appreciated. Thanks Clivep

Negative 78022 pIm developing a web app in Django that manages chores on a reoccurring weekly basis. These are the models Ive come up with so far. Chores need to be able to be assigned multiple week days and times. So the chore of laundry could be sunday  800am and wednesday  530pm. I first want to confirm the models below are the best way to represent this. Secondly, Im a little confused about model relationships and custom model methods. Since these chores are on a reoccurring basis, I need to be able to check if there has been a CompletedEvent in this week.

Negative 78022 pThis is my first post, and Ive only recently started programming for Android and OpenGl, so be nice to me p  pIm writing a little app that will include one screen that will use a palettised image for quick changes in colour. For speed I thought I could implement the system using a shader, so I have a shader up and running using the fantastic examples from the Open GL ES 2.0 programming guide. The problem that Ive been banging my head over for the past couple of days is coming up with a way of referencing my palette data within the shader.p  pMy shader currently isp  precodeprecision lowp float varying vec2      vtexCoord uniform sampler2D stexture uniform int       spalette[204]   Specify a palette of 64 rgb entries  void main     vec4 col  texture2D stexture, vtexCoord     int index  intcol.r  255.0  3     glFragColor  vec4floatspalette[index]  255.0, floatspalette[index1]  255.0,  floatspalette[index2]  255.0, 1.0  codepre  pAfter playing around with this for ages and not getting very far I discovered that if I reference my palette data by a constant value I could get results, but not by referencing with a variable. Having searched for a while with Google I discovered that this was just the way it was with GLSL 1.1 and was fixed with GLSL 1.3.  I believe Android is running on GLSL ES1.0 which is based on GLSL 1.3, so it should work, but I cant for the life of my get it to work.  I cant find anything in the GLSLES specs that would suggest its not possible either, so where am I going wrongp  pIf it simply isnt possible, then does anyone have any other ideas how to get around this rather crippling flaw in my planp

Negative 78022 pBefore today I would have said this is just not possible, to have an app that runs overlayed on top of everything else home screens, apps, dialer, etc.p  pIf you try the free application Super Manager it does exactly this.

While the icon or widget is on the screen you can still interact with the app running behind it.p  pHow is this possible and how can we recreate this functionalityp  pUpdate Here is some images of it in action.  You can see the overlayed application running as a small arrow on top of Dolphin.  Then when you press it you can see the application running as a big widget kind of thing.  Even while the widget is up you can still interact with the background app.  In this example dolphin is the background app.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNKw1X.jpg altImage 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comm9jvg.jpg altalt textp

When I try to change it to multivalue 2 things happen whether it shows a message This stored procedures cannot accept multiple values. or if try to directly enable parameter in procedure to accept multiple values it just closes an application without any errors. As far as I understand this is a limitation of stored procedures, not crystal reports. Anyways I need to fix this. I just do not know how to manipulate parameters in crystal reports environment. please discuss.

Negative 78022 pI would like to say, that I will be glad for any reply. I will try to structure my text for better understanding.p  pstrongSituationstrong I run thematic internet forum, where you can add topics as your favorites in the menu and the menu shows the number of new posts in these topics. So everytime you reload the page go anywhere on the whole site, new posts for all topics in your favorites are checked.p  pstrongProblemstrong This is of course quite expensive on DB, because it is common to have 2050 favorites and I have to check the DB if any post was added in any of these topics. The average topic has 10002000 posts. And this happens for every pageview for every user which is approximately 900 000 pageviews per month.p  pstrongPossible solution 1strong I store number of total posts in every topic and I store number of last viewed posts for every topic, for every user. This may be fastest, but it has a lot of disadvantages, which are functional deleting, filtering of posts, etc..p  pstrongPossible solution 2strong I store id of last viewed post for every topic, for every user. This is very good solution, but about ten times slower then previous one.p  pstrongDatabasestrong I store all posts for all topics in one huge table  hunderds of thousands of posts.p  pstrongQuestionstrong I would like to remove problems that brings solution 1, but I need to keep the speed. I thought of creating a table for each topic and use Solution 2, but I dont know if it will help.

Negative 78022 pIm having a hard time wrapping my head around what seems to be a somewhat simple issue. Lets say that I have a business whose hours are 12PM  3AM daily. Each customer gets a bonus once per day based on their initial purchase for that day. So, lets say they spend twenty bucks on their first transaction that day  they might get a twenty percent discount on that transaction, and thats it for the day.p  pIm trying to figure out the most accurate way to check the last bonus that was given and make sure that the customer is eligible for one. I cant do a simple 24hour check, obviously, because if a customer comes in at 11 PM Monday, for instance, and again at noon Tuesday, they will not get their second bonus.p  pWe are using a VB6 frontend for our POS, with a SQL Server 2008 R2 database. Each time a bonus is applied, it is audited on the database side, so I can easily query the last time the bonus was applied.p  pEDIT I should note that, for various reasons, the solution cannot include making any changes to the structure of the database.p

My inclination is to use stdstring as much as possible and use QString strongonlystrong when I need to pass strings to Qt classes like those that work with the file system.p  pAs I was programming this morning, it hit me that it may be bad design to have both stdstring and QString sprinkled throughout my code. Should I completely switch to QString Has anyone else run into this design choicep  pQt provides a lot of the same functionality of STL, but Im still hesitant switching completely since Qt is less standardized and stable.p

But, as my favourite article says, dont use accessors, unless you are 100 certain you need more than simple atribute access, they are waste of CPU and programmer time.p  pAgain, please, dont attack me for not using accessors all the time.

Negative 78022 pThis question has been asked a THOUSAND times... so its not unfair if you decide to skip readinganswering it, but I still thought people would like to see and comment on my approach...p  pIm building a site which requires an activity feed, like FourSquare.p  pBut my site has this feature for the eyecandys sake, and doesnt need the stuff to be saved forever.p  pSo, I write the beventtypeb and buseridb to a MySQL table. Before writing new events to the table, I delete all the older, unnecessary rows by counting the total number of rows, getting the beventidb lesser than which everything is redundant, and deleting those rows. I prune the table, and write a new row every time an event happens. Theres another busertextb column which is bNULLb if there is no usergenerated text...p  pIn the frontend, I have jQuery that checks with a PHP file via GET every x seconds the user has the site open. The jQuery sends a request with the last update id it received. The ltdivgt tags generated by my backend have the id attribute set as the MySQL row id. This way, I dont have to save the blastreceivedidb in memory, though I guess theres absolutely no performance impact from storing emoneem variable with a very small int value in memory...p  pI have a function that generates an update text depending on the eventtype and userid I pass it from the jQuery, and whether the busertextb column is empty. The update text is passed back to jQuery, which appends the freshly received event ltdivgt to the feed with some effects, while simultaneously getting rid of the tail end event ltdiv with an effect.p  pIf I more importantly, the client want to, I can have an event archive table in my database or a different one that saves up all those redundant rows before deleting. This way, event information will be saved forever, while not impacting the performance of the live site...p  pIm using CodeIgniter, so theres no question of repeated code anywhere. All the pertinent functions go into a LiveUpdates class in the library and model respectively.p  pIm rather happy with the way Im doing it because it solves the problem at hand while sticking to the KISS ideology... but still, can anyone please point me to some resources, that show a better way to do it A Google search on this subject reveals too many articlesSO questions, and I would like to benefit from the experience any other developer that has already trawled through them and found out the best approach...p

I integrate web service server with C server with XML protocol over TCPIP But what is good solution for integrate c server with Web Service clientp  pI think implementing SOAP web service or using some stuff for it is not good idea on C side, then how to good integrate c with C web service client.p  pBest way is setup C windows service server for creating requests via Web Service This C server will get commands over XML from C server.p  pGreetings,p
Negative 78022 pSo, I get this error messagep  precodeEDT ERROR  syntax error at or near union at character 436 codepre  pThe query in question is a large query that consists of 12 smaller queries all connected together with UNION ALL, and each small query has two inner join statements. So, something likep  precodeSELECT table.someid as id     ,table.lastname as name     ,table2.groupname as groupname     , Leads      as Type from table  inner join table3 on table3.specificid  table.someid INNER JOIN table2 on table3.specificidtable2.groupid where table3.deleted0   and table.someid gt 0  and table2.groupid in 2,3,4 LIMIT 5  UNION all  query2.... codepre  pNote that table2 and table3 are the same tables in each query, and the fields from table2 and table3 are also the same, I think.p  pQuick question I am still kinda new to all thisbr What does Leads      as Type mean Unlike the other statements preceding an AS, this one isnt written like table.something.br Quick edit question What does table2.groupid in 2,3,4 mean  p  pI checked each small query one by one, each one works and returns a result, though the results are always empty for some reasonthis may or may not be dependent on the user logged in though, as some PHP code generated this query. p  pAs for the results themselves, most of them look something like this they are arranged horizontally thoughp  precodeidinteger name character varying80 groupname character varying100 type unknown codepre  pThe difference in the results are twofold 1Most of the results contain the same field names but quite a few of them have different field lengths. Like some will say character varying 80, while others will say character varying 100, please correct me if this is actually not field length. 22 of the queries contain different fields, but only the id field is different, and its probably because they dont have the as id part. p  pI am not quite sure of what the requirements of UNION ALL are, but if I think, it is meant to only work if all the fields are the same, but if that funky number changes the one in the brackets, then are the fields considered to be different even if they have the same namep  pAlso, whats strange is that some of the queries returned the exact same fields, with the same field length, so I tried to UNION ALL only those queries, but no luck, still got a syntax error at UNION.p  pAnother important thing I should mention is that the DB used to be MySQL, but we changed to PostGreSQL, so this bug might be a result of the change i.e. code that might work in MySQL but not in PostGres. p  pThanks for your time. p

As you see, the primary key of ConfigurationParam is a composite. However, since it is a map maintained by Configuration whose primary key is the second part of this composite, I think this should be OK. Hibernate did not complain anyway.pli lipConfigurationParam.code is already mapped as property in the entity itself. Probably, then you cannot use it as map key anymore However, also this Hibernate would tell me, I guesspli ol  pI tried to find answers in the Hibernate documentation you know cats and such things and read a lot of other questions here but did not find an answer to this particular issuep
Negative 78022 pI have been looking at CSS3HTML5 frameworks available, but there is simply too many to make a decision quickly, and they all seem to be focused on streamlining javascript development and UI elements. p  pIn particular, a very useful part of a framework would be to create CSSbased layouts quickly  without having to worry about browser compatibility. However, without actually using the existing frameworks it seems impossible to understand whether the existing frameworks do that, or how they do it.p  pFor example, I would like to create a simple layout that fills the whole page but has a minimum heightwidth. This should be a 5line CSS declaration but its a headache because of IE. Ideally a good framework would allow me to define this once, instead of adding in a special solution for every browser.p  pWhich of the existing frameworks address this Im not talking necessarily about frameworks as the meaning of framework is somewhat loose when talking about HTMLCSS but other things that you find helpful in development.p  pI have looked at columnlayout frameworks like 960.gs or blueprint but they seem to be geared toward website development, rather than web application development.p  pThanks,p

I have only found one web application so far that has correct button behavior Facebook. Looking at their code for it, it looks like theyve done quite a lot of jumpingthroughhoops to make it work correctly tracking all the mouse events manually and not using buttons at all. The code is dense, uses Javelin, and Im not yet clear on all the pieces required to make it work.p  pI know Im somewhat kidding myself since if it were easy, everyone would do it, but Im going to ask anyway. Is there any generallyavailable piece of code that handles this feature Is there a simpler solution than reverse engineering Javelin, even if it is only applicable to WebKit Javelin isnt verywell suited to my lightweight needs. My ultimate goal is correct button behavior for a codeUIWebViewcode embedded in a native app, so hybrid JavaScriptObjC solutions are acceptable as well though no hybrid approaches come to mind.p

The only difference is that I am using cvBlob library, instead of cvmoments cvBlob was faster and more accurate.

I am converting from BGR to HSV.p  pIve read in some papers that using YCbCr colorspace is even better in color tracking. Is it good idea to convert from BGR to YCbCR It should be slightly faster, as it requires less multiplications I am not sure about that  I do not know how OpenCv does it internally. Does this algorithm need some changes, or can I just convert lower and upper boundaries for tracked color from HSV to YCbCr, and then use inRangeS method, as I did with HSVp  pIs there any way to get the frame from driver in YcbCr or YUV I am not asking about HSV, because this is not supported by v4l2, AFAIR.p  pDo you have any other ideas I dont want to use IPP or GPU.p

Negative 78022 pIve spent all day Googling and looking at various questions on here, trying to come up with the best solution for implementing authentication and authorization. Ive come up with part of the solution now, but am hoping someone can fill in the gaps. I realise there is a lot of text below, but please bear with me Op  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have inherited a part completed CRM application which currently uses JSF 2.0, JavaEE 6, JPA and a PostgreSQL database. Unfortunately, the guys who originally started building this web app in their infinite wisdom decided that it would be best to leave authenticationauthorization to the end  Ive now got to put it in.p  pThe application is essentially split into three layers  the views, the managed beans and the DAOs. This means that the managed beans are particularly fat since they contain all of the business logic, validation and navigation logic.p  pstrongAuthenticationAuthorization requirementsstrongp  ol liForms based authentication, validating against credentials stored in the PostgreSQL database.li liThe only page that will be publicly accessible by anonymous users will be the login page.li liI need to prevent access to certain areas of the application based on a users role. For example, only users with the Admin role should be able to access the createedit user page.li liI also need to be able to restrict access to certain areas of a page. For example, a user with the Sales Rep role should be able to view a customers details, but the saveedit button should only be displayed if the user has the Customer Service role.li ol  pstrongWhere Im atstrongp  pThe first thing I plan on doing is to follow this a hrefhttpwww.greenkode.com201109userauthenticationandauthorizationusingjaasandservlet30loginUser Authentication and Authorization using JAAS and Servlet 3.0 Logina example. This I believe will fulfil my first 3 requirements.p  pIn order to showhide save buttons etc on pages, I can use the technique described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7037642suggestiononjsfauthorization7037841this SO answera. This will partly solve requirement 4, however I think that I still need to secure the action methods and or the managed beans themselves. For example, I would like to be able to add an annotation or something to the save method on the customer bean to ensure that only users with the Customer Service role can call it  this is where I begin to run into issues.p  pI guess one option would be to do something similar to what I am proposing to do in the view and use facesContext to check if the current user is in role. Im not keen on this as it will just clutter up my code and would rather use annotations instead. If I did go down this route however, how would I return a http 403 statusp  pThe javax.annotation.security. annotations seem to be a good fit for declaritively defininig access to areas of the application, however as far as I understand, they can only be added to EJBs. This would mean that I would need to move all of my business logic out of the managed beans where it currently resides to new EJBs. I think this would have the added benefit of separating the business logic out into its own set of classes delegates, services or whatever you chooses to call them. This would be quite a large refactor however which isnt going to be aided by a lack of unit test or integration tests. Im not sure whether the responsibility of access control should be at this new service level either  I think it should be on the managed beans.p  pstrongOther alternativesstrongp  pDuring my research I have found lots of people mentioning frameworks such as Spring and Seam. I have some limited experience with Seam, I think it would have been a good fit for this project and from what I recall I believe it solves the authorization issues I am having, but I think it is too late in the day to introduce it now.p  pI have also seen Shiro mentioned in various places. Having looked at the a hrefhttpshiro.apache.org10minutetutorial.html10 minute tutoriala this seemed like a good fit, especially in conjunction with a hrefhttptechbeats.deluan.comapacheshirotagsforjsffaceletsDeluan Quintaos tagliba but I have been unable to find any tutorials or examples of how to integrate it with a JSF web app.p  pThe other alternative I have come across surprisingly regularly is implementing a custom solution  this seems crazy to mep  pstrongSummarystrongp  pIn summary then, Id really like some guidance on whether Im heading down the right path in terms of implementing authentication and authorization and how I fill in that missing piece of securing individual methods andor managed beans or at least the code they delegate to andor how I can manually return a HTTP Status 403.p

These objects periodically shoot at each other until these objects are killed or moved out of the scene. p  pNow the problem the game constantly eats up memory. And I want to find out what I am doing wrong.p  pThere are no obvious leaks like overretained objects. Scene gets codedealloccodeed, objects gets removed from parents and cleaned up, animations gets stopped etc. p  pAnyway, the memory keeps going somewhere. I am using following codep  precode void reportMemory      struct taskbasicinfo info     machmsgtypenumbert size  sizeofinfo     kernreturnt kerr  taskinfomachtaskself,                                    TASKBASICINFO,                                    taskinfotampinfo,                                    ampsize     if kerr  KERNSUCCESS         NSLogMemory in use in Kbytes f, info.residentsize  1024.0     else         NSLogError with taskinfo s, macherrorstringkerr  codepre  pto find how much memory consumed at each start of the scene. And reported number is always greater then previous one.p  pI tried to use allocations profiler but honestly I wasnt able to figure out anything useful. I see that total living bytes are basically the same, but process constantly allocates and deallocates something.p  pWhat would you suggest me to look at Basically, I am seeking advices for how to debug memory operations in my case.p  pstrongEDIT What have helped mestrongp  pIt turned out that I had NSZombieEnabled turned on. Basically, it was the main factor for constant memory consumption increases. Some useful information and a tip can be found in a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1622091249690coneybeare answerap  pThe second most useful thing was to use Instruments Leaks and Allocations as Jack suggested. It helped me to find couple of subtle leaks.p
Negative 78022 pI have a solution in visual studios. 2 of the projects it contains are test projects. 2 are actual software to be deployed. 1 of these projects is stand alone the other, lets call this project B. The main project, lets call it project A, references project Bs dll file.p  pBoth of these projects have some content that needs to be copied to output. They both work fine on their own however, when project A builds and launches it does not pull project Bs content. This would make sense of course since the only thing it references is a dll. Furthermore, it doesnt do any installation of project B it just has a reference to it.p  pI think ideally some step in there would allow me to have both project A and B both installed and run this is a powerpoint addin btw, and their assets potentially merged. If needed their assets can be separate, but I just need to make a calls to project B from A and have it return me some files.p  pI think this might sound more complicated than it is.p

This process of checkmodifycreate happens frequently.p  precode private class Thread1 implements Runnable              public void run                 keepRunning is volatile                 while keepRunning                     String id      ItemA                   int[][] value  map.getid                    If value is null, create an int[][] and put it back as value for Id                   If value is not null, modify the contents according to some logic                                        codepre  pc Finally, I have another thread, called strongThread2strong. This thread takes an id, checks if the map has a value for it. If it doesnt, nothing happens. If it does, then it sums up the values in int[][] and uses the number for some calculation no modifications here.p  pI am trying to figure out if my operations are atomic. Operations in b are fine as the creationmodification of the array and insertion into the map is confined to only one thread strongThread1strong.p  pAlso, since insertion into the map establishes a happensbefore action, this will ensure that c will see the updated values in int[][].p  pHowever, I am not too sure of what would happen if Thread2 looks up the same int[][] in the map and tries to sum it up while Thread1 is modifying it. p  pAm I correct in thinking that Thread2 will see the older but uncorrupted values in int[][]. Reason being that until Thread1 has finished putting the value back into the map, the new modifications wont be visible to Thread2.p  pThanks very much.p

I hesitate to use the word upgrade when port would be more apt given that the upgrade wizard in past versions of VS may as well have just commented out the code and said Hey, why dont you restart from scratchp  pIn one procedure which Im bringing across the codeLencode function was used to determine the length of a string variable. That still works in VB.Net though I imagine that its actually a call to the codeStrings.Lencode Method, but the other alternative is to just query the code.Lengthcode property of the variable.p  pThe question is which to use and why. Ive looked through the relevant MSDN pages and all they seem to tell me is that the methodproperty exists. Nothing is said about performance issues, particularly when loops of large numbers of calls might be involved.p  pMy question, then, is whether anyone is aware of any tested and confirmed benefit of using one approach over the other, or whether its merely a question of personal preference. Any pointers on similar situations that I might encounter as I make the progression would also be appreciated though given the Stack Overflow guidelines its just this one issue that Im interested in seeing whether theres a specific answer to.p

Negative 78022 pI have some inherited code for FlexLM that is converting an integer to a pointer that needs to work on both 32bit and 64bit machines.  The integer is being filled in from argc of the arguments to the program using scanf to read the integer value.p  pHow should I reliably read the argc string to get a value suitable for assigning to a pointer so that it works on both 32bit and 64bit machinesp  pPresently the code looks something like thisp  precode FlexLM includes this typedef char  LMAVALTYPE  so that it will be big enough for                                 any data type on any system    My main includes this [...] if strcmpargv[i], maxlen    int max  0   i    if i gt argc      break      sscanfargv[i], d, ampmax   if max      fprintfstderr, Error maxlen s Invalid line lengthn, argv[i]    else      lcsetattrlmjob, LMAMAXLICENSELEN, LMAVALTYPEmax     [...] codepre  pAt first I was thinking I could use codeuintptrtcode, but how would I get codescanfcode to know the size accordingly  Perhaps I should just read it as a pointer value using codepcode, but the man page gives me doubts about it working reliablyp  precode   p      Matches an implementationdefined set of sequences, which shall be the           same as the set of sequences that is produced by the p  conversion           specification  of  the  corresponding fprintf  functions.  The           application  shall  ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer           to a pointer to void. The interpretation of the input item is           implementationdefined. If the input item is a value converted earlier           during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall           compare equal to that value otherwise, the behavior of the p           conversion specification is undefined. codepre  pId rather not use ifdef to make two separate versions based on pointer size as that seems like an ugly wart on the code to me.p

So, as users type out a word, they can see a dropdown list showing fewer and fewer choices to select from. p  pThe thing is, sometimes the users input will not be among the choices in that list. I believe that when users see that list go empty, they will give up on their original search term and either enter a different one, or simply delete it and leave the field blank. p  pWhen that happens, I want to know what was the original search term entered p  pBecause after collecting that info over time, I plan to add the most popular ones to the list, for future users to choose fromp  pSo my question is, what is the best way to find out what users typed in, but didnt submit p  pMy idea so far is to listen for when the user takes the focus off the input field, and get its value on change.

Negative 78022 pI have a .Net server application backed by a SQL server DB. Im using nHibernate fluent to handle all the DB operations.

For example, I have the strongcodemembers classcodestrong which obviously needs to be persisted in the DB and I also have the strongcodeloggedinmembers classcodestrong which only holds runtime data and which doesnt need to be persisted.

In the end there is rankingp  pe.g.p  precodeword1 1 3 7 9 10 11 ... word2 2 3 4 9 10 12 ... codepre  pIs the following understanding of fields correctp  pDifferent fields mean different index spaces or at least different lists. e.g. having fields abstract and body could end up in a scenario like thisp  precodeabstractword1 7 10 ... bodyword1     1 3 9 10 11 ... abstractword2 3 4 ... bodyword2     1 3 9 10 12 ... codepre  pIs this understanding correct If not, what are those fields in terms of the underlying inverted index I could not find any documentation that explicitly states how it is done internally.p  pApart from that I wonder if there is some support for a feature like searching in allany field. If implemented like i assume it to be, this should be troublesome or require redundancy by keeping lists like above as well. Implementing fields by means of subranges of full wordlists could certainly perform better.p  pWould be great to know what Lucene actually does.p

The User table has the identity primary key to generate the UserId, and then I want to also save a UserDetails object for this UserId. Doing this separately this would be easy, but Im trying to find a way if I can do it in one go, as the User class contains a reference to the UserDetails object. egp  pUser u  new User  Nameme, Age17, UserDetails  new UserDetails  Detail1  1  p  pSo all I have to do is pass around the user object, which then contains object based references to other related subinformation I have simplified it greatly for this example but there are several more similar classes as UserDetails, like UserMatchConfiguration etc and a lot of fields for each one p  pI want to be able to build up the object in code, or to have it passed around and modified, then to call save on the parent User object, and for it to then save all related objects. I have achieved this so far using onetoone mappings and save cascades, but the problem is when you create a new object, the UserId is set to zero for all related classes when I want it to save the User class first, then to propogate the generated UserId to all the related classes and then save them.p  pMapping is as follows so far.p  precodeltclass nameUser table[User]gt     ltid nameUserId unsavedvalue0gt       ltgenerator classidentity gt     ltidgt     ltproperty nameFirstName gt     ltproperty nameLastName gt     ltproperty nameEmailAddress gt     ltproperty nameDateOfBirth gt     ltproperty nameGender gt     ltproperty namePostcodePartOne gt     ltproperty namePostcodePartTwo gt     ltmanytoone nameUserLocation columnUserLocationId gt     ltproperty nameDateJoined gt     ltproperty nameLastLoggedOn gt     ltproperty nameStatusgt     ltproperty nameStatusNotes gt     ltbag namePhotos orderbyDisplayOrder asc inversetrue lazyfalse cascadeallgt       ltkey columnUserId gt       ltonetomany classUserPhoto gt     ltbaggt     ltbag nameInterests inversetrue lazyfalse cascadeallgt       ltkey columnUserId gt       ltonetomany classUserMatchInterest gt     ltbaggt     ltbag namePreferences inversetrue lazyfalse cascadeallgt       ltkey columnUserId gt       ltonetomany classUserPreference gt     ltbaggt     ltonetoone nameProfile classUserProfile cascadesaveupdate gt     ltonetoone nameMatchCriteria classUserMatchCriteria gt     ltonetoone nameMatchLifestyle classUserMatchLifestyle gt     ltproperty nameLastUpdated gt   ltclassgt codepre  pAs you can see I am trialing it just with the Profile object for now to try and get it working. How can I have it so that the main User object saves first, then passes the UserId to the other classes as they all use that as their primary key p  pAgain I could not do the cascade save, then set the UserId manually on each sub class and save them separately, but I am trying to do it in a single call.p

Negative 78022 pSo here is my scenario I read from a socket and based on the contents on the packet i put the packet into an appropriate queue. So if i have 10 queues there will be 10 if else ifs or 10 cases of a switch statement to select the proper queue. So, there can be atmost 10 comparisons.p  pAnother way could be to ask the broadcasterserver to broadcast on 10 different ports where feed from each port will have packets for a single specific queue, on my end i can listen to each socket through a saperate threadOr i can use a thread pool if the traffic on certain ports is lessnonuniform. So that now i dont have to select which queue the packet belongs to but now the phenomenon of conext switch is introduced.p  pFrom here my intelligence and technical knowledge prevent me going further.

Negative 78022 pI am using SVG to display chained animations each path automatically starts when the previous path is complete and managed to make it work fine. I even worked in a refresh element that resets the animation chain.p  pMy problem, is that I want to provide a way to skip the animation. It is easy to add an element that triggers codeltsetgtcode elements to display the paths without animation, however this does not stop the animation chain, which keeps going through each element resetting and redrawing them.p  pstrongI need a emWebKitsupportedem way to stop a chained SVG animation...strongp  pThings I triedp  ul lipSetting an codeendcode attribute on the codeltanimategtcode element that gets triggered by codeskip.clickcode stops the animation of the current stroke, but still fires codeendcode events and therefore doesnt stop the chain.pli lipSetting the codebegincode attributes to codeindefinitecode and manually triggering the animation of the next path at the end of each path. However, this would require the ability to execute code on codeonendcode in the codeltanimategtcode element, which WebKit apparently does not support yet.pli lipFinding any way to stop ongoing animations without triggering an codeendcode event, but references for current versions of SVG do not seem to give any I have seen it listed as a problem to solve, in a presentation on drafting future versions of SVGSMIL.pli ul  pI was hoping anybody had figured a workaround of some kind to this problem. I figure I must not be the first person to want a chain of animations with a restart and skip buttons...p  pFor reference, here is a simplified example of the type of SVG code I am using generated onthefly by a program, so possibly not as compact as could bep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltsvg width220 height220 viewBox0 0 109 109 xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlink xmlspacepreserve version1.1  baseProfilefullgt       ltpath dM33.28,19.04c1.84,0.71,3.7,0.86,5.4,0.63c4.950.67,27.954.58,29.864.92c3.460.62,4.06,1.36,2.11,3.58c1.95,2.2211.41,13.1716.35,17.19 stylefillnonestrokergb230,71,71strokewidth3 strokedasharray67.00,67.00 strokedashoffset67.00 strokelinecaproundgt         ltanimate idstep0 attributeNamestrokedashoffset values67.000 dur1.3s begin0.10refresh.click0.01 fillfreeze keySplines0.5 0 0.5 1 calcModespline gt         ltset attributeNamestrokedashoffset to67.00 beginrefresh.click gt      ltpathgt      ltpath dM52.48,37.74c6.42,2.97,11.75,30.73,5.24,52.57c2.8,9.388.09,2.9610.47,0.99 stylefillnonestrokergb230,71,71strokewidth3 strokedasharray70.00,70.00 strokedashoffset70.00 strokelinecaproundgt         ltanimate idstep1 attributeNamestrokedashoffset values70.000 dur1.4s beginstep0.end0.1s fillfreeze keySplines0.5 0 0.5 1 calcModespline gt         ltset attributeNamestrokedashoffset to70.00 beginrefresh.click gt      ltpathgt      ltpath dM12.25,51.48c3.75,1.14,8.79,1.03,12.48,0.49c16.772.47,42.865.84,58.536.75c4.260.25,9.110.34,13.11,0.57 stylefillnonestrokergb230,71,71strokewidth3 strokedasharray85.00,85.00 strokedashoffset85.00 strokelinecaproundgt         ltanimate idstep2 attributeNamestrokedashoffset values85.000 dur1.7s beginstep1.end0.1s fillfreeze keySplines0.5 0 0.5 1 calcModespline gt         ltset attributeNamestrokedashoffset to85.00 beginrefresh.click gt      ltpathgt      ltg idskipAnimation visibilityvisiblegt ltset  attributeNamevisibility beginstep2.end endrefresh.click tohiddengt          lttext idskip x95 y105 strokeAAA strokewidth0.5 stylefontsize11pxgtlttextgt     ltggt     ltg idanimationDone visibilityhiddengt ltset  attributeNamevisibility beginstep2.end endrefresh.click tovisiblegt          lttext idrefresh x95 y105 strokeAAA strokewidth0.5 stylefontsize11pxgtlttextgt     ltggt ltsvggt codepre
Negative 78022 pWere porting to Android some interactive iOS apps used to teach young children with learning disabilities.  We have hit a major usability issue, because we cant figure out how to disable physical or onscreen navigation buttons Home and Recent Apps.p  pBefore anyone says you dont want to do that, we fully understand why you would always want these buttons enabled for an ablebodied adult, but these children pose a unique set of accessibility issues.  Specificallyp  ol liTheir fine motor control may be poor  they may inadvertently touch a different area of the screen to the area they intend, or accidentally use more than one finger at once.li liThey may have weak muscle tone and poor physical strength  so e.g. the bottom of the palm of their hand may drop and touch the screen while trying to just use a finger.li liThey struggle to achieve and easily become disheartened or disruptive if they fail.li ol  pFor instance, a typical 5 year old child with Down syndrome will accidentally drop out of the app they are using as a result of inadvertently touching the Home button when this happens repeatedly, and the adult teacher or parent has to go back into the app for them repeatedly, the child loses interest and focus.  Another typical scenario is a young child with Autism, who may freak out completely and need physically restraining if this happens while using their favourite app.  Also, many disabled children will try to poke any other button they can find, in search of a response.  In any of these situations, a potentially valuable educational session may have to be completely abandoned.p  pWere aware of SYSTEMUIFLAGHIDENAVIGATION and SYSTEMUIFLAGLOWPROFILE, but these only reduce the visibility of the onscreen buttons until the child touches some other part of the screen, and then they reappear in a way thats more distracting than if they were visible all the time.p  pOn iOS there is the Guided Access feature that solves this problem trivially.  Can we emulate anything similar on Androidp

Negative 78022 pI have seen many examples of working with dates in Android using Calendar and GregorianCalendar classes. Recently I came across the following in Android Developers codeTimecode documentationp  blockquote   pThe Time class is a faster replacement for the java.util.Calendar and java.util.GregorianCalendar classes. An instance of the Time class represents a moment in time, specified with second precision.p blockquote  pThis prompted me to replace all the Calendar functions with the faster Time class functions.p  pHere is my code for reading the date stored in the SQLite databasep  pcode extract milliseconds long value from SQLite databasebr Long timeLong  note.getLongnote.getColumnIndexOrThrowNotesDbAdapter.KEYDATEbr Time currentTime.settimeLongcodep  pHere is the partial code for preparing the integer values for populating the date picker and displaying the formatted date string in the mPickDate button p  precode    mDay  currentTime.monthDay              Day of the month 031     mMonth  currentTime.month               Month 011     mYear  currentTime.year                 Year      mPickDate.setTextcurrentTime.formatA, d b Y  using strftime equivalent to dateFormat  new SimpleDateFormatE, dd MMM yyyy codepre  pNote the format A used to get the long string for the day of the week. This part of the formatting code works perfectly well and displays the correct string with the formatted date, including the correct day of the week. p  pClicking on the mPickDate button invokes the DatePicker widget, which allows for changing and setting the new date.p  pThe following code shows the handling of the newly selected date from the DatePickerp  precode    private DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener mDateSetListener          new DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener               public void onDateSetDatePicker view, int year, int monthOfYear,                     int dayOfMonth                   new method using Time class                 currentTime.setdayOfMonth, monthOfYear, year                  mPickDate.setTextcurrentTime.formatA, d b Y                   old method using GregorianCalendar class                 mCalendar  new GregorianCalendaryear, monthOfYear, dayOfMonth                 mPickDate.setTextdateFormat.formatmCalendar.getTime                                           codepre  pThe mPickDate button gets the correct date string displayed, as selected in the Date Picker, except for the day of the week A, which is always shown as Sunday. Why p  pNote that mPickDate.SetText code is identical to the one used earlier to format the button date string, extracted from the SQLite database field.p  pI had to modify the above code, by adding an extra line of code to set the date value in the currentTime Time object once again   p  precode            currentTime.setdayOfMonth, monthOfYear, year             currentTime.setcurrentTime.toMillistrue             mPickDate.setTextcurrentTime.formatA, d b Y codepre  pMy question is why it was necessary to use the currentTime.set procedure twice in the above DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener code, in order to get the day of the week string to display correctly p  pWould this possibly be an issue with Android codeTimecodecode itself using SDK version 16  p

Negative 78022 pMy vb.net code calculates the growth rate of a companys stock price for every quarter from 1901 to present and stores it in a datatable.  This takes a while to perform 1015 minutes.  I would like to save the information in the datatable after it is calculated so that I dont have to recalculate past growth rates every time I run the program.  When I open my program I want the datatable to contain any growth rates that have already been calculated so I only have to calculate growth rates for new quarters.p  pShould I store my datatable in a database of some kind or is there another way to do this  My datatable is quite large.  It currently has 450 columns one for each quarter from 1901 to present and can have thousands of rows one for each company.  Is this too big for Microsoft Access  Would Microsoft Excel be an optionp  pThanksp

Negative 78022 pI need to programatically extract information from a solution which contains almost 150 projects in it. The solution file is not flat though, so some of the projects are organized into folders, the folder hierarchy can be more levels deep. This fits a recursive solution I could write a function, which enumerates a list, and if the element is a project it would examine it, if it is a folder it would go into the folder and recursively call itself to examine the folders content. The gist of itp  precodedte  [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]GetActiveObjectvisualstudio.dte.11.0  function traverseproject      param[object]prjnode, [int]level     if prjnode.Kind eq FAE04EC0301F11D3BF4B00C04F79EFBC              Write prjnode.Name         Write level          if prjnode.Kind eq 66A267208FB511D2AA7E00C04F688DDE              foreach prjsubnode in prjnode                      traverseprojectprjsubnode, level  1                 foreachprjn in dte.solution.projects      traverseprojectprjn, 0  codepre  pThe problem is that the prjnode object what the recursive function gets is weird. codeWrite prjnode.Namecode doesnt output anything. Probably for the same reason I cannot iterate through the nodes of the folder object. Right now in the code above its codeforeach prjsubnode in prjnodecode, that just doesnt do anything silently. I tried codeforeach prjsubnode in prjnode.ProjectItemscode, that gives error. I tried any kind of combinations.p  pFrom the error messages it seems that the codeprjnodecode is type of a codeDTEcode codeProjectItemcode a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryak94096828vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowlinka, code8E2F1269185E43C78899950AD2769CCFcode. I can print out the codeCountcode property and it seems valid, but I dont see any property on the interface where I could get a hold of the contained elements. So maybe thats why I cannot iterate through Theres no way I see the Visual Basic example at the bottom of the MSDN page I linked, but I need a working PowerShell solution.p  pThe first call of the function seems to work OK, for example it sees the codeprjnode.Kindcode property, but after the first recursive call things are lost.p

Negative 78022 pWe are having an issue with a pair of ListView controls in WPF, these controls are linked together to work as a single grid with a frozen column on the right hand side which contains a checkbox. This is so that the left hand section will be scrollable but the right checkbox will always remain on the screen. p  pWe also have a number of datatriggers which are required to set the visual state in the customized listview style. This is used to highlight the background colour of the selected rows we also have a selected item style.p  pWe have chosen to use datatriggers to fire the viusal states, rather than setting the background colour of the row as this doesnt give us the required control over the design.p  pThe issue we are currently experiencing is related to scrolling the ListView when it contains a large number of rows we believe that this is causing the control to redraw the content, however it then does not seem to fire the datatriggers setting the relevant visual states for each row. p  pThe Two

Negative 78022 pDoes anyone have any thoughts on the best way to implement a scrollspy in an angular app I started out with a hrefhttptwitter.github.iobootstrapjavascript.htmlscrollspyTwitter Bootstraps implementationa but I am struggling to find a good place to initialize and more importantly refresh after DOM changes the plugin.p  pBasically my controller does an async request for data when its loaded and cant fully render the DOM untill the request returns. Then when the DOM is fully rendered the scrollspy plugin needs to be refreshed. Right now I have my controller broadcast an event on its scope once the needed data has been received and I have a directive that picks up this event. I dont really like this solution for two reasonsp  ol lipIt just feels hacky.pli lipWhen I refresh the scrollspy plugin after receiving this event it is still too early since the DOM isnt updated untill later in the cycle. I tried evalAsync but in the end I had to use a timeout and just hope the DOM renders fast enough.pli ol  pI had a look at the source for a hrefhttpsgithub.comtwitterbootstrapblobmasterjsbootstrapscrollspy.jsthe Bootstrap plugina and it seems fairly straight forward to implement this from scratch. The problem I was having with that is that when I tried to make a directive for it I couldnt seem to subscribe to scroll events from the element I received in the link function.p  pHas anyone found a good solution to something like this, or does anyone have any suggestions Im in no way tied to using the Bootstrap implementation, as of right now the only dep I have on Bootstrap is the scrollspyplugin I just added.p

However, it comes at a cost of an overhead 25 times that of a classical class function. In my case, this is quite OK in the case of setting a property, where the overhead is insignificant compared to the processing that needs to be done when setting. p  pHowever, I need no processing when getting the property. It is always just return self.property. Is there an elegant way to use the setter but not using the getter, without needing to use a different internal variablep  pJust to illustrate, the class below has the property var which refers to the internal variable var. It takes longer to call var than var but it would be nice if developers and users alike could just use var without having to keep track of var too.p  precodeclass MyClassobject   def initself     self.var  None     the property var. First the getter, then the setter   property   def varself     return self.var   var.setter   def varself, newValue     self.var  newValue     ... and a lot of other stuff here     Use var a lot How to avoid the overhead of the getter and not to call self.var   def useAttributeself     for i in xrange100000       self.var  something codepre  pFor those interested, on my pc calling var takes 204 ns on average while calling var takes 44 ns on average.p

Negative 78022 pAre there any known issues surrounding returning 204 No Content through API Managerp  pLooking at the timing of the packets on the wire from APIManager, it looks like for other requests, APIManager waits for the client to acknowledge receipt of the packets making up the response, and then proceeds to close the connection, whereas for a 204 response, it immediately closes the connection, before the client has acknowledged receipt of anything.  p

Negative 78022 pI have been looking for a simple way to create a shortcut to a file in C, but Ive only found external dlls that do that. Its actually quite surprising, theres no built in way to do that..p  pAnyway, I know that lnk files are just text files with a certain command and a given path. I thought that maybe I could create a text file in the code set its text to the right command and change its extension to .lnk Ive tried to do that manually first, but failed to do so.p  pIs there a way to do something like that or maybe another simple way to create a shortcut to a certain path in cp  pemJust to be clear, by Shortcut I mean an .lnk file that leads to the fileem emEdit And by file I mean any file Id want, not only a shortcut to my own applicationemp  hr  pIll edit if it doesnt work well for every scenario.p  pAdd these referencesp  ol liMicrosoft Shell Controls And Automationli liWindows Script Host Object Modelli ol  pAdd this namespacesp  precodeusing Shell32 using IWshRuntimeLibrary codepre  pNext appears to be workingp  precodevar wsh  new IWshShellClass IWshRuntimeLibrary.IWshShortcut shortcut  wsh.CreateShortcut     Environment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.Desktop  shorcut2.lnk as IWshRuntimeLibrary.IWshShortcut shortcut.TargetPath  CUsersZiminDesktoptest folder             shortcut.Save codepre  pHope it helps others as well, thanks for your attention.p  pAlso, if there IS a way to create a file, write the right commands and then change it to an lnk file, please let me know.p
Negative 78022 pI have written some come involving random numbers in matlab. When I run the program in matlab it works fine, giving me different random numbers each time the program is run.p  pI decided to use matlabs C code generating features to turn the code I had written in matlab to C. In the original matlab function, I used the inbuilt randn function to generate the random numbers. I then used matlabs ability to automatically generate C code from a matlab function to turn this code into C. To generate random numbers, the automatically generated C code uses the following algorithm exactly as shown at the bottom of this post.p  pMy code then simply calls the randn function. However, each time I run the code, the random numbers generated are the same. What can I do to avoid it p  precode       randn.c     Code generation for function randn     C source code generated on Fri Aug  2 133345 2013       Include files  include rtnonfinite.h include

Negative 78022 pI have an action bar with a couple items. If user presses the spinner buttons, the items will show, as expected. Then an event is causing the screen to go Full screen, for which the action bar, along with the spinner will hide. The problem is that the items stay and wont go away until user taps somewhere in the screen, as you can see from the screenshots below. p  pThis is what Im using to go fullscreenp  precodemActivity.getWindow.getDecorView.setSystemUiVisibilityView.SYSTEMUIFLAGHIDENAVIGATION mActivity.getActionBar.hide     codepre  pThe question is, how do I work around this Doesnt sound normal to me that the spinner items dont disappear...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comty2eW.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 78022 pI have implemented an SMS receiver which intercepts incoming SMS messages without any issues. However, when I install GO SMS Pro and set Disable other message notification, then my app does not receive any broadcast message even though I have set the priority on intent filter very high. Is there a way to overcome so that my app always receive a SMS broadcast irrespective of what user does on Go SMS Pros app, especially since my app does not show any UI popup notification As soon as I uninstall GO SMS Pro, my app starts getting incoming SMS broadcasts and works fine.p  pHere is the log when an incoming SMS is received and GO SMS Pro is installed. There is some magic done by GO SMS Pro which I dont understand. Can someone explain what is done here and how can I make sure my app does get ordered broadcast notification every time.p

Negative 78022 pI asked a similar question before, and the answer was simplyp  blockquote   pif JavaScript can do it, then any client can do it.p blockquote  pBut I still want to find out a way do restrict AJAX calls to JavaScript.p  pThe reason is p  pIm building a web application, when a user clicks on an image, tagged like thisp  pcodeltimg srcsrc.jpg dataid42gtcodep  pJavaScript calls a PHP page like thisp  precode.ajaxaction.phpactionclickampid42 codepre  pthen action.php inserts rows in database.p  pBut Im afraid that some users can automate entries that clicks all the ids and such, by calling necessary urls, since they are visible in the source code. p  pHow can I prevent such a thing, and make sure it works only on click, and not by calling the url from a browser tabp  h2p.s.h2  pI think a possible solution would be using encryption, like generate a key on user visit, and call the action page with that key, or hashmd5sumwhatever of it. But I think it can be done without transforming it into a security problem. Am I right  Moreover, Im not sure this method is a solution, since I dont know anything about this kind of security, or its implementation.p

Negative 78022 pIve attended a local programming contest on my country. The name of the contest is ACMICPC Indonesia National Contest 2013.br The contest has ended on 20131013 150000 GMT 7 and I am still curious about one of the problems.br You can find the original version of the problem a hrefhttpjohn.petra.ac.idm26410038INC2013C.htm relnofollow titleACMICPC INC 2013, Problem Cherea.p  pstrongBrief Problem Explanationstrongbr There are a set of jobs tasks that should be performed on several servers computers.br Each job should be executed strictly from start time Ssubisub to end time Esubisubbr Each server can only perform one task at a time.br The complicated thing goes here It takes some time for a server to switch from one job to another.br If a server finishes job Jsubxsub, then to start job Jsubysub it will need an intermission time Tsubx,ysub after job Jsubxsub completes. This is the time required by the server to clean up job Jsubxsub and load job Jsubysub.br In other word, job Jsubysub can be run after job Jsubxsub if and only if Esubxsub  Tsubx,ysub  Ssubysub.  p  pThe problem is to compute the minimum number of servers needed to do all jobs.p  pstrongExamplestrongbr For example, let there be 3 jobsp  precodeS1   3 and E1   6 S2  10 and E2  15 S3  16 and E3  20 T1,2  2,  T1,3  5 T2,1  0,  T2,3  3 T3,1  0,  T3,2  0 codepre  pIn this example, we need 2 serversp  precodeServer 1 J1, J2 Server 2 J3 codepre  pstrongSample Inputstrongbr emShort explanationem The first code3code is the number of test cases, following by number of jobs the second code3code means that there are 3 jobs for case 1, then followed by Esubisub and Ssubisub, then the T matrix sized equal with number of jobs.  p  pre 3 3 3 6 10 15 16 20 0 2 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 4 8 10 4 7 12 15 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 8 10 4 7 12 15 1 4 0 50 50 50 50 0 50 50 50 50 0 50 50 50 50 0 pre  pstrongSample Outputstrong  p  preCase 1 2 Case 2 1 Case 3 4 pre  pstrongPersonal Commentsstrongbr The time required can be represented as a graph matrix, so Im supposing this as a emdirected acyclic graph problemem.br Methods I tried so far is brute force and greedy, but got Wrong Answer.

Negative 78022 pI apologize if this issue has already been explained but I have searched and not found an answer that I can comprehend. I have been using VB.Net for years to automate CATIA by adding their libraries and calling the exposed methods, properties, etc. I wrote some some basic code to C.Net and was disappointed to find that the objects are not exposed in the same way as they are in VB. What I mean is when an object is examined in the debugger or watch window, the properties are not displayed in C, but they are displayed in VB. This makes it pretty much impossible for me to debug CATIA automation in C, which doesnt seem right. Something must be missing. I have added the COM libraries to the project and have Included them in the header properly. The intellisense is working and the basic methods of the CATIA objects are visible in the watchdebug but not all methods and properties are visible and I cant interrogate them by manually typing a object.getName or something like that in the debug window. Ive attached images of two watch window results for identical code. The first is from VB.Net and you can see how much more information is available. The second is from C.Net and you can see how little information is available. How can I access the same level of information in the C debugger that I see in the VB debugger for COM interop assemblies One thing I noticed that may be a clue here is that in VB, there are many object properties which appeared as get methods in C. For example, the property Document.Name in VB is found as Document.getName in C.p  pOK, so the site wont allow me to post images since I need at least 10 reputation points.

Alls well when I hardcode stuff, but when I try something like codeone.onclick, function this.load url path.to.myView code it doesnt work, and the message I get from the console Im testing this with coderunservercode says code[16Nov2013 203718] GET 7B HTTP1.1 404 3178code I looked it up, and code7Bcode is the html escaped equivalent of codecode, so it seems that the template tag is getting escaped, somehow. I tried wrapping this in code autoescape off code, but it didnt work. p  pAll the other DjangojQueryrelated stuff Ive seen on SO suggest this kind of thing just works, but Im not having any luck.p
Negative 78022 pMysql supports four byte utf8 characters as of mysql 5.5, but you need to use charset utf8mb4. Apparently on the document storage side MongoDB also supports just up to 3 byte chars.p  pAre there any database systems that support full UTF8 character ranges natively Im having difficult of finding a comprehensive reference, since most will claim they support UTF8 when its not fully the case.p  pemEdit Just to add, Im looking for this solution because Im having issues with fetched data containing chinese or emoji characters. I have a DBAL which accepts UTF8 in the config but I have to manually alter character sets on certain columns to utf8mb4 mysql. Id like to know some alternatives for future projects.emp
Negative 78022 pI have an issue in a view controller when it comes to returning cells for a tableview. I am using Parse backend to get a file. I have 2 asynchronous calls there. I understand that the code outside of this will execute first and code dependant on the result should be in the block. p  pIn brief my code is as follow I have a model array of model objects. I use the object to set the labels and the image I have on screen. The place image is stored in parse backend, in my attachment it is the top left image. I am trying to retrieve this and display it within the top left image. p  pNext to each NSLog I have the code for the model object it is building i.e. Di2zPyCmn8. Thats one model object id.p  pFrom my logging you can see that the cell returns before everything is complete. Which makes sense as the block is asynchronous.   p  pCan anyone lend some assistance so I can build the tableviews correctlyp  pThe misbehaviour is when I do not have an image in the backend in Parse for an object. The tableview cell image top left should be blank. Sometimes though, random images from other backend objects can be found there. p  pI believe this is to do with the flow and the early returning of the cell. p  pWhen I have an image in the backend, that image displayed in the place image view top left as expected. p  precodeUITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath        static NSString CellIdentifier  Cell      BIDActiveDealCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]      if cell  nil          cell  [[BIDActiveDealCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]           get model object from array and use its properties to populate the fields from CustomCell.h     if [self.activeDealModelArray count]  0          cell.descriptionLabel.text  Array count is 0      else BIDActiveDealModel dealActiveModel  [[BIDActiveDealModel alloc]init]         dealActiveModel  self.activeDealModelArray[indexPath.row]      NSLogcellforRow  start of else  , dealActiveModel.placeObjectId     cell.descriptionLabel.text  dealActiveModel.dealTitleModelPuts title field.

Things fail since the Bean Resolver uses the Type as a hash key to find beans.p  pBasically I dont think I can mask a class that is annotated made into a bean by the CDI with an extra method to receive custom events.  Would have been cool but a Type is a Type i.e. no idea how to proxy or fake the equalshashCode.p

Negative 78022 pI have a Fortran 90 program that creates a large column of integers at the end of each loop. I would like to write this column into an HDF5 file with each new integer column being written as a new column in the HDF5 file. That is, at the end of the first loop, write column 1, then at the end of the second loop, write column 2, etc, until a 2D array with as many columns as there were loops is created.p  pEach of these integer columns will always be the same length and I know how many columns will be needed in the end. To do this, I create a dataspace large enough to hold the final 2D array. Then I select a hyperslab beginning with offset 0,0, then 0,1 for the next loop, 0,2 for the loop after that, etc., each time writing the data that my program creates.p  pThis isnt quite working, however. Currently, with the offset 0,0 everything works. However, if I try to write to a hyperslab in any other column, I get nonsense values in my output .h5 file.p  pAm I implementing the hyperslab code correctlyp  pHere is a MWE which creates a dataspace of 20,10 and writes a column of twenty 5s into the first column of the .h5 file. If voffset is changed from 0,0 to 0,1, the 5s are not written and instead random numbers will appear in the second column of the .h5 filep  precodeprogram hdf5test use hdf5 implicit none   HDF5 file and path names  characterlen10, parameter  outfilename  OutData.h5  Output file name  characterlen8, parameter  dsetvbinnedname  velocity   Declare HDF5 IDs integerHIDT  outfileid        File identifier integerHIDT  dsetvid            integerHIDT  dataspacevid   Dataset dimensions in the file integerHSIZET, dimension2  binnedvdims  20,1   Chunk dimensions integerHSIZET, dimension2  exportbinnedvdims  20,10   File dimensions   Data buffers integer, dimension20  binnedvdata   Chunk dimension   Chunk parameters integerHSIZET, dimension2  voffset, vchunkcount  integer  rank  2 integer  error  HDF5 error flag   Initialize FORTRAN interface call h5openferror   Create a new file using the default properties. call h5fcreatefoutfilename, H5FACCTRUNCF, outfileid, error   Create the data space for the binned dataset. call h5screatesimplefrank, exportbinnedvdims, dataspacevid, error   Create the chunked dataset. call h5dcreatefoutfileid, dsetvbinnedname, H5TNATIVEINTEGER, dataspacevid, dsetvid, error   Select hyperslab voffset  0,0 vchunkcount  20,1  call h5sselecthyperslabfdataspacevid, H5SSELECTSETF, voffset, vchunkcount, error  binnedvdata  5  Write a column of 5s   Write the data to the dataset. call h5dwritefdsetvid, H5TNATIVEINTEGER, binnedvdata, exportbinnedvdims, error, filespaceiddataspacevid   Close dataspace, dataset, and file call h5dclosefdsetvid, error call h5sclosefdataspacevid, error call h5fclosefoutfileid, error  call h5closeferror  end program hdf5test codepre

Negative 78022 pI implemented a custom QAbstractTableModle and Im using a stdvector for my data objects.p  pNow I wanted to implement the sort method, to get my table sorted by column.  Thats basically what I dop  precodevoid SBStateTableModelsort int column, QtSortOrder order  emit layoutAboutToBeChanged  switch column  case Address     if order  QtDescendingOrder         stdsortstates.begin, states.end, addrcompdesc     else         stdsortstates.begin, states.end, addrcompasc  default     return   emit layoutChanged  codepre  pBut emitting layoutChanged alone doesnt redraw the view. When mark a row and cycle through them, they get updated as they are being highlighted. p  pThe documentation also speaks about updating the persistent indexes. Some people on here have suggested, that this is in fact not necessary.  Im not even sure how to go about it. Getting the list with persistentIndexList and then I have to sort it. But stdsort is not a stable sort. Im not sure how to match the persistent indices with my vector indices.p  pEDIT There was just a break missing in the case So the function would return before emitting the layoutChanged signal.p

Negative 78022 pI have a model that has an integer property. When the model is submitted with code23443code, the model binder works great and the value is available in the action. But if the model is submitted with a thousands separator like code23,443code, the value isnt parsed and the property is zero. But I found that a property with the type of decimal could have the thousands separator and it would parse and be populated correctly.p  pI found out that a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryxbtzcc4w28vvs.11029.aspxby default codeInt32.Parsecode doesnt parse thousands separatora but codeDecimal.Parsecode does allow thousands separator. I dont want to have to write a check likep  precodepublic ActionResult SaveCar model, FormCollection form      Int32 milage     ifmodel.MyProperty  0 ampamp Int32.TryParseform[MyProperty], NumberStyles.AllowThousands, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, out milage          model.MyProperty  milage      else         ModelState.AddModelErrorInvalid, Property looks invalid      [...]  codepre  pevery time I deal with these fields. It looks ugly, and moves all the validation out of the model attributes. Changing the type of the property to decimal just to make the model binding work doesnt seem like a smart idea. When I look into the model binder, it looks like its using codeTypeConvertercode to complete the conversions from string to the type. And it a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.componentmodel.int32converter28vvs.11029.aspxlooks like codeInt32Convertercode uses codeInt32.Parsecode with codeNumberStyles.Integercodea. p  pIs there a way to change the behavior of codeInt32Convertercode to allow the thousands separator  to be parsed by default Maybe override the default codeNumberStylescode on codeInt32.Parsecode across the entire app Or is adding my own model binder which parses the integers with codeNumberStyles.AllowThousandscode the onlycorrect course of actionp

Negative 78022 pFor a school project Ive built a scanner and connected it to matlab. The scanner scans images 16by16 pixels of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Im using a principal component analysis in order to classify the scans. Due to the low accuracy of the scanner, I need to preprocess the scans first, before I can actually send them through the recognition machine.p  pOne of these preprocessingsteps is to thicken the lines. So far, Ive used a pretty simple averageing filter for this codeH  ones3, 3 . 9code. This bears the problem, that the circular gap of the digits 8 and 9 is likely to be closed. I enclose a picture of all my preprocessingsteps, where the problem is visible the image with the caption threshholded still shows the gap, but it disappeared after the thickening step.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comynO0y.png altenter image description herep  pMy question is Do you know a better filter for this thickeningstep, which would not erase the gap Or do you have an idea for a filter which could be applied after the thickening to produced the desired result Any other suggestions or hints are also greatly appreciated.p

Negative 78022 pI have a set of tables where we used to maintain transaction histories of bank account.p  pWe have applied grouping on the transaction and get the grouped transactions.

Negative 78022 pSo I have wrote a BHO that exposes a function that I call from Javascript.

Furthermore, I am stuck on trying to add a legend  I only need the colorbar portion, since the end user doesnt really care about the X and Y dimensions. Looking at the colorbar example, it seems that I need to add an axis, but I dont understand how Im telling it that the axis I need is the Z axis. p  precodexvals  listfirstarray[datalocdictionary[xcoordindex]][] yvals  listfirstarray[datalocdictionary[ycoordindex]][] yvals  [i for i in yvals] zvals  listfirstarray[datalocdictionary[valueindex]][]  plt.scatterxvals, yvals, s  lenxvals2, c  zvals, cmap  rainbow plt.show codepre  pHere is an example of what I am trying to duplicate img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXhDW3.png altenter image description here And here is what the code above produces img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFSLeV.jpg altenter image description herep  ul liI would like the second to look a little more like the first, i.e., if there were a way to adjust the markers to be large enough to approximate that look, that would be idealli liI am struggling with creating a legend.

I have a simple language that defines a dataflow program. You can see it on a hrefhttpsgithub.comjrguenthershiro relnofollowgithuba, if youre curious. I lex and parse the language with ANTLR4. I use listeners to walk the parse tree and evaluate the code. p  pThe problem I have most recently run into is I need to be able to modify the code at runtime. I need to be able to define new objects and create instances from them. Note, Im not referring to having reflection in the language. Im referring to having a program like an IDE modify the internal representation of the source code.p  pI have started off down the path of defining a bunch of definition objects to create an AST, but I just realized this approach will require me to come up with my own solutions for walking the AST. Rather than reinvent the wheel, Id rather use ANTLRs listenersvisitors.p  pAnother problem I face is the need to be able to output the current state the AST as code at any point in time The tool Im embedding the language in needs to be able to save. I am using StringTemplate to generate the code from my definition objects. I think I should be able to make ST render the parse tree.p  pIn general, I need to able to lex, parse, evaluate, refactor, evaluate, and generate code all from within my runtime. p  pRather than create my own definition objects, Im wondering what the best approach is modify the ParseTreeTokenStreamsp

Negative 78022 pI have recently watched a a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYQs6ICvgmo relnofollowvideoa explaining that allocating data sequentially is very good for performance. It also showed how using OOP approach can slow down applications. To me this seems similar in some way to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11227809whyisprocessingasortedarrayfasterthananunsortedarraybrilliant questiona. Having this in mind, I concluded that calling a virtual method requires 2 indirections which breaks caching if function access object fields and one jumpwhich breaks pipelining. Calling a nonvirtual method, requires 1 indirectionwhich still breaks caching.p  pNowadays, OOP is superextensively used.

Negative 78022 pI am working on making an app that performs an action when the sound of a clap is recognized. I have looked into simply measuring the average and peak power from an AVAudioRecorder and this works okay, but if there are other sounds then it reports lots of false positives. I believe I need some kind of audio fingerprinting for this to work while other audio is playing. Now I know that this has been asked a lot before on SO, but most of the answers say something along the lines of Use FFT and then the person says Oh okay but no clear explanation is given and I still have no idea how to correctly identify sounds using an FFT.p  pCan anyone clearly explain, cite another tutorial, or post a link to a library that can identify sounds using audio fingerprinting  p  pThanksp

Negative 78022 pInitially I have an array of time and an array of voltage and I have applied FFT and converted that time domain into frequency domain.After applying FFT I got an array of frequencies.

Any references that would be implemented using frequency values and cut off frequency would help.p  pI am completely new to this topic so my approach of question might be little weird.

Negative 78022 pI m using SAX Parser with php to parse a 1.2GB xml file and the results are written in a txt file. After several minutes I get an error of no memory at line x. When this is done the text file output is only a few kB whereas the expected output file could well exceed several MB in size and has stored very few of the information needed. I m running this project on a windows 7 64bit system with i7 processor and 18 GB RAM, using xampp, but I have also run it at a 32bit system with the same results. I have modified the php.ini with these commandsp  precodeinisetmaxexecutiontime, 72000  inisetmemorylimit,13056M inisetrealpathcachesize,13056000k inisetmaxinputtime,1 codepre  pIs there something I should modify in php.ini Could this be some kind of buffer overflow when the code doesnt find the filtered data to parse and only reads junk data Could this be an error caused by the OS file size restrictions Has anyone else solved anything similar  Thank you in advance.p

Negative 78022 pI am developing a web application where I want to allow google login. I am asking for the plus.login permission which should among other things grant me access to the users circled people list. p  p The problem is that when I request for the circled list people.list with visible collection, I get an empty response. br After some time researching, I found out that if I go to the list of user application configuration page in Google and I add all circles explicitly there the option is called Advanced connection settings. Then it works. Another way it works is if the user edits the list of circles on the authorization popup where ironically all of them are selected by default, so I would assume that in that case I should get access to them even if I didnt click on edit. p  p I guess I am doing something wrong, because I cannot understand why Google would force the user to authorize you in such a subtile way.

So I have pieced together code that looks as following.p  precodeclass func postToFacebookmessage String, appID String      var accountStore  ACAccountStore     var accountType  accountStore.accountTypeWithAccountTypeIdentifierACAccountTypeIdentifierFacebook      var optionsForPosting  [ACFacebookAppIdKeyappID, ACFacebookPermissionsKey [email], ACFacebookAudienceKey ACFacebookAudienceFriends]      accountStore.requestAccessToAccountsWithTypeaccountType, options optionsForPosting          granted, error in         if granted                   var options  [ACFacebookAppIdKeyappID, ACFacebookPermissionsKey [publishstream, publishactions], ACFacebookAudienceKey ACFacebookAudienceFriends]                  accountStore.requestAccessToAccountsWithTypeaccountType, options options                      granted, error in                     if granted                          var accountsArray  accountStore.accountsWithAccountTypeaccountType                              if accountsArray.count gt 0                              var facebookAccount  accountsArray[0] as ACAccount                              var parameters  DictionaryltString, AnyObjectgt                             parameters[accesstoken]  facebookAccount.credential.oauthToken                             parameters[message]  message                              var feedURL  NSURLstring httpsgraph.facebook.commefeed                              let posts  SLRequestforServiceType SLServiceTypeFacebook, requestMethod SLRequestMethod.POST, URL feedURL, parameters parameters                              let handler SLRequestHandler    response, urlResponse, error in                                 printlnresponse                                 printlnurlResponse.statusCode                                                           posts.performRequestWithHandlerhandler                                                                   else                         printlnAccess denied                         printlnerror.localizedDescription                                                        else             printlnAccess denied             printlnerror.localizedDescription                codepre  pUnfortunately I am still getting p  precodeThe Facebook server could not fulfill this access request Invalid permission publishstream codepre  pI have setup my app on the Facebook dev site and I have also added the correct bundle identifier to the dev site.p
Negative 78022 pI know that there are algorithms of drawing line, circle, ellipse pixel by pixel e.g. Bresenhams algorithmsp  ol lia hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBresenham27slinealgorithm relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBresenham27slinealgorithmali lia hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMidpointcirclealgorithm relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMidpointcirclealgorithmali ol  pI wonder why these algorithms and I am sure that there are algorithms for drawing ellipsoid, sphere, cylinder in 3D and not being used in OpenGL to draw corresponding primitives.

Negative 78022 pJust a quick foreword Im an artist, and only have a small amount of programming understanding, and I just started learning windows batch files a couple hours ago.p  pSo, at my school, when we render our files in Maya, we have to do it on a local drive, and we use several computers to speed up this process. This creates hundreds of images across multiple computers. My plan was to create a batch file that copies the images as they are finished over the network to a single drive so managing my rendered images is easier.p  pIm using a for loop to go through file names in this case, BallTestxxxx.exr, and I can print out the name just fine but, when I try setting the filename to a variable in the loop, it ends up printing out nothing.p  pWhere I have echo.asdf, I want that to be where it reads the file, and from there, checks to see if the render is finished I have a couple of ideas for the latter, but for now, Id just like some insight on what Id need to do to make the first part work. I can see in the results, that when I try to set asdf as the filename, it gives me BallTest000x.exr, which I know isnt right.p  precodeset filenameBallTest set extension.exr  for l x in 1, 1, 3 do      if x lss 10          set asdffilename000xextension         echo.filename000xextension         echo.asdf        pause codepre  pThanks in advance,p  pGeorgep

If myList is [10, 20] then both parents should be returned.  And finally, if myList is [10, 20, 60], nothing should be returned.p  pI dont think the following will work, because the values that children has that arent in the list will remove it from the results rightp  precodeparents.wherep gt p.children.allc gt myList.containsc.SomeValue codepre  pand an any wont work, because it will just return anything as long as one of its children matches.  I need to ensure that the parent has a child that matches every item in myList.  I also thought about adding a count to make sure the matched items were at least as large as the myList.length, but that might not work because SomeValue doesnt have to be distinct in the collection of children I guess i could run a distinct subselect on the childrens SomeValuesp

Negative 78022 pMy goal is to implement a way of selecting objects in a scene by mouse, for a game.  My theory is that all I need do is ask for the points codemouseX, mouseY, 1code and codemouseX, mouseY, 1code in Native Device Coordinates, untransform them through the view matrix first so both points still overlap from the cameras perspective, then untransform them through the perspective matrix so I get points I can use with a simple raycast against model bounding boxes.  I might have mixed up the order of untransformations, correct me if Im wrongp  pI believe I can convert the opposite way around, from the perspective scene to NDC, using this algorithm I am still writing the test scene, so I havent had a chance to see if this is correct thoughp  precodeglmvec3 CameraconvertPerspectivePointToDeviceCoordinatesglmvec3 worldPoint     glmvec4 vector  mfinalViewTransform  glmvec4worldPoint, 1.0f     vector.x  vector.w     vector.y  vector.w     vector.z  vector.w     return glmvec3vector.x, vector.y, vector.z    codepre  pBut to do the reverse is puzzling me... how would one do that  Any answer that takes advantage of glm for matrice math would be appreciated, but I can work from just math okay as well.p  pAlso, Im using OpenGL without the fixed pipeline, if that changes anything.

Negative 78022 pKahan, in a hrefhttpwww.cs.berkeley.eduwkahanMathH110Cross.pdf relnofollowCrossa on page 14, shows that the angle between the true cross product and the one calculated using floating point arithmetic degrades as the angle between the two crossed vectors approaches zero or , this angle measuring the error in the floating point calculation of the normal to the plane spanned by the crossed vectors.  As the singularities are approached, the orthogonality of the floating point normal becomes more compromised.  According to Kahan, the error isp  psinttrue, tfloat   u23ucsct1, t2 p  pwhere ttrue is true orthogonal vector after taking the cross product, t1t2, to infinite precision, whereas tfloat is the result of the cross product using floating point arithmetic and u is the unit round off.p  pMy question is there a similar inequality for the sum of two vectors.  That is, how far off from the true direction does the floating point vector sum get as the angle between the vectors to be added approaches zero or   In my particular application, the vectors will be unit length.p  pEdit I should add that the vector that is the sum of the two vectors will be normalized. p

It wont continue at all unless the request matches one of these types.p  pSo when I use the following requestp  precode final HttpServletRequest dummyRequest  new org.apache.catalina.connector.RequestFacadenew org.apache.catalina.connector.Request  ...  codepre  pIt successfully runs and returns the results of the JSP from inside the thread.p  pbWebspherebp  pI have not been able to produce the same results on Websphere.p  pWebsphere requires an instance of com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.srt.SRTConnectionContextImpl and then manipulating the ServletContext to its original class com.ibm.wsspi.webcontainer.facade.ServletContextFacade, but then I get stuck on an access200 null pointer exception inside com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.srt.SRTServletRequestSRTServletRequestHelper, which makes it seem like I am breaking Java somehow.p  precodejava.lang.NullPointerException at com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.srt.SRTServletRequestSRTServletRequestHelper.access200SRTServletRequest.java2629 codepre  pThis is my current codep  precodeSRTConnectionContext n  new SRTConnectionContextImpl  SRTServletRequest n.getRequest.getRequestContext .setCurrWebAppBoundaryWebApp ServletContextFacade context     .getIServletContext  servletContext.getRequestDispatcherjspReport.jsp.includen.getRequest, n.getResponse codepre  pbThe Endbp  pHopefully someone can find a way to accomplish this on Websphere.br p  pFrom my viewing of the source, unless there is a side method I am missing, you cannot run a includeforward without the servers own specific class files for the request. Even request wrappers are unwrapped to their base classes, and that is why I was always getting the Class Cast Exception with and without a wrapper.p  pIf there isnt a cleaner, not server specific with server classes, method of getting the results of a JSP from inside a thread, than this may be the answer to my original question, regardless of how messy it seems.p
Negative 78022 pIve a c single threaded application and currently working on to make it multithreaded with the use of thread pools. I am stuck in deciding which model would work for my problem.p  pHeres my current scenariop  precodeWhile1      dosometask     waittime  codepre  pAnd this is repeated almost forever. The new scenario has multiple threads which does the above. I could easily implement it by spawning number of threads based on the tasks I have to perform, where all the threads perform some task and wait forever.p  pThe issue here is I may not know the number of tasks, so I cant just blindly spawn 500 threads. I thought about using threadpool, but because almost every thread loops forever and wont ever be freed up for new tasks in the queue, am not sure which other model to use.p  pI am looking for an idea or solution where I could break the loop in the thread and free it up instead of waiting, but come back and resume the same task after the waitwhen the time gets elapsed, using something like a timerchecking timestamp of when the last task is performed. p  pWith this I could use a limited number of threads like in a thread pool and serve the tasks which are coming in during the time old threads waitsvirtually.p  pAny help is really appreciated.p

Negative 78022 pWe have a Silverlight 5 app that loads up fine on several machines, but certain ones get white screens.

It seems the XAP may not be downloading fully. Everything looks successful with results of 200, yet the XAP file downloads received column shows less MB downloaded than my machine does. Were both on the same windows version 8.1, IE version 11, and Silverlight version 5.1.30514.0 according to microsofts installation site.

In lowbit mode, the available colors are limited to black,   white, blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, and yellow. When designing for   lowbit ambient mode, use a black or a white background. For OLED   screens, you must use a black background. Nonbackground pixels must   be less than 10 percent of total pixels. You can use lowbit color for   up to 5 percent of pixels on screens that support it.   a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comdesignwearwatchfaces.htmlSpecialScreens relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.android.comdesignwearwatchfaces.htmlSpecialScreensap blockquote  pI believe that seems to contradict what the reviewer said but am not sure.

I enclose the SAML to illustrate what I mean, Id like my email address to be returned in the codeltsamlNameIDgtcode field and not my user name codesmithcode.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltsaml2pResponse Destinationhttpscloudapp.comauthsamlcallback              IDijnccdceglphfggpnhhdkckhdkendndabahdjlef InResponseTo4b740f60a4200132eb44002590a743aa              IssueInstant20150303T221225.000Z Version2.0              xmlnssaml2purnoasisnamestcSAML2.0protocolgt ltsaml2Issuer FormaturnoasisnamestcSAML2.0nameidformatentity               xmlnssaml2urnoasisnamestcSAML2.0assertiongtlocalhost ltsaml2Issuergt ltsaml2pStatusgt     ltsaml2pStatusCode ValueurnoasisnamestcSAML2.0statusSuccessgt ltsaml2pStatusgt ltsaml2Assertion IDkjggobfabnbnfnpbngjeeolfjjjoimapmkpadbfl IssueInstant20150303T221225.000Z Version2.0                  xmlnssaml2urnoasisnamestcSAML2.0assertiongt     ltsaml2Issuer FormaturnoasisnamestcSAML2.0nameidformatentitygtlocalhostltsaml2Issuergt     ltsaml2Subjectgt         ltsaml2NameID FormaturnoasisnamestcSAML1.1nameidformatemailAddressgtsmithltsaml2NameIDgt         ltsaml2SubjectConfirmation MethodurnoasisnamestcSAML2.0cmbearergt             ltsaml2SubjectConfirmationData InResponseTo4b740f60a4200132eb44002590a743aa                                            NotOnOrAfter20150303T221725.000Z                                            Recipienthttpscloudapp.comauthsamlcallbackgt         ltsaml2SubjectConfirmationgt     ltsaml2Subjectgt     ltsaml2Conditions NotBefore20150303T221225.000Z NotOnOrAfter20150303T221725.000Zgt         ltsaml2AudienceRestrictiongt             ltsaml2Audiencegthttpscloudapp.comltsaml2Audiencegt         ltsaml2AudienceRestrictiongt     ltsaml2Conditionsgt     ltsaml2AuthnStatement AuthnInstant20150303T221225.001Zgt         ltsaml2AuthnContextgt             ltsaml2AuthnContextClassRefgturnoasisnamestcSAML2.0acclassesPasswordltsaml2AuthnContextClassRefgt         ltsaml2AuthnContextgt     ltsaml2AuthnStatementgt ltsaml2Assertiongt codepre  pp

The code for roulette method followsp  precodeint Sampleint  p, int n     forint i  1 i lt n i         p[i]  p[i  1]Accumulate probability          double ranval  double rand  RANDMAXGenerate random number between [0,1]     int index  0     for index lt n index         ifranval lt p[index]             break                   return index  codepre  pWe first accumulate the probability from the second to the end as the top 4 lines show, and then random a val between [0,1] We assume the sumpi1. In the next step, we check which interval the val falls into, and return the corresponding interval index or the state number.p  pFor example, the given distribution is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 for 4 states 1, 2, 3, 4. After the accumulation, it comes to strong0.1strong, 0.10.2strong0.3strong, 0.30.3strong0.6strong, 0.60.4strong1.0strong. Once we random a val, such as 0.5. The program will check the interval [0, 0.1, then the [0.1, 0.3, and the [0.3, 0.6 and so on to determine which val will fall into. In this case, the state 3 will be the answer.p  pThis method is the best implementation strategy as I know. The above code implements with two round traverse of array p certainly it can be simplified within only one round. However, is there any other methods to do the random sample task that better than the above, maybe less time complexity or more interpretable If you have ideas, could you give some references or linksp

Negative 78022 pSo, for my question have a look at my Jmeter setup img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWk4Ex.png altJmeter setupp  pLet me explain whats happening and then move on to my question. p  pstrongExplanationstrong On the server I have a guava cache with timeout of 5 seconds and a DB hooked up to it. Request A sends data read from csv file to the server and puts it in cache. It returns a unique ID corresponding with that data. Request B sends a seconds request with that unique ID that evicts the item from cache and saves to DB. The third request, C, uses that unique ID again to read from DB and process the data.p  pNow, to share that unique ID and some other URL params between thread groups I put them in a queue in Jmeter using the jpgc  InterThread Communication PreProcessor and PostProcessor. All works like it should, both Jmeter and Server.p  pstrongQuestionstrong To finish up this setup I need to add one more thing... For each request A only 10 random of the unique IDs need to be put in queue A. And again for each request B only 10 random of those unique IDs need to be put in queue B. How can I do this last part if Jmeter does not allow ifcontrollers to be put as part of an httprequestp

Negative 78022 pI am using Entity Framework 6.3 for an MVC 5 application, using codefirst for the first time with SQL Server 2012. The Database does not exist before hand, it is all being created from scratch by EF. When I attempt to start the application, and hence EF should create the database, its giving me the following SqlException error messagep  pThere is already an object named TableName in the database.p  pI have in my project the following very basic Entityp  precode[TableTableName] public class ItemStatus      public int id  get set      public string Status  get set   codepre  pThats all it is.p  pIf I change the name of TableName to something else, like foofoo, then the error message reflects this change. So Ive not put two Models in with the same table name or anything obvious like that.p  pEverything had been working fine until just recently, Im not sure what I could have changed to make it break like this. The last thing I did before it stopped working was add a new View Model. Removing this completely doesnt help.p  pAdditional information 1 My solution has two projects, each with a DbContext. DbContext2 from Project2 inherits from DbContext1 from Project1  which in turn is inheriting from IdentityDbContext. I was thinking that maybe this has something to do with it Like both projects are trying to Create the same table for some reason. Although Im pretty sure it emshouldem check if the table exists or not before trying to create it.p  pAdditional Information 2 When I look at the Database server after getting this error, I see that it has created multiple other tables from entities in Project1 with no apparent problems.p  pAdditional Information 3 If I hadnt made it clear yet, it was working fine earlier today. Ive had that Entity in my project for a while with no problems, and Id not changed anything about it before getting this error.p  pThanks in advance for any advice.p  pEdit I should have mentioned that Im using MigrateToLatestVersion as my initialization. I dont get the problem if I use DropCreateDatabseAlways.p

Negative 78022 pI have UIView which contains an UIWebview. The UIView has leading and trailing constraints 20pt. Now if the UIWebview get zoomed in which I detect via UIScrollViewDelegatescrollViewDidZoom, I set the constant of the constraints to 0pt. And if I scroll out, I will reverse the behaviour and set the constant of the constraints to the old value 20pt.p  pThe problem is that after the UIWebview is resized it still has the old zoomScale, which I need to set programatically to to right value. But for that I need to wait until the UIWebview is resized. Is there something like a callback which tells me that my UIWebview has its new size and I can set the right zoomScalep  pAt the moment I do all this in an UIViewController but I also could encapsulate the UIView in an custom view.p

Negative 78022 pIve decided to just try again from the start since Im a bit more awake now and go over building this step by step. ive looked at some of the answers and there seems to be many ways one could go about this. Im trying to do this using what Ive learned so far. Ive learned about variables, basic functions, objects, arrays, this and the push method. I know for, while, do while, for in loops, though the for loop is the one I understand the best.p  pHere is my new approach to building this, I know its unnecessarily long but I want to be able to get a basic understanding of how to piece the different things Ive learned together in a very simple way. This is more about learning how to go about building simple programs. Then I would proceed in finetuning the program to make it more concise and clever. If you could have a look and tell me how I would proceed with what Ive got so far... p  pHere is the code, Ideally I want to run a function when theres a new visitor that asks for their name and number. Then create a new customer object with the given name and number and push it to a visitors array. once Ive successfully figured that out I would use loops to check the array if the visitor is new or not, and update their number of visits everytime they come.p  precodearray that will contain Customer objects var visitors  [john]  Customer object function Customername, phonenumber   this.name  name   this.phonenumber  phonenumber will eventually add a visits method logging number of visits    var john  new Customerjohn smith, 333  visitor funtion that runs everytime there is a new visitor var visitor  function    visitor does not have a set name or number yet   var userNumber  variable userNumber is currently equal to   0   var userName  variable userName is currently set to   undefined   console.loguserName, userNumber    ask for visitor name and number   var askNumber  prompttype your number   var askName  promptwhat is your name    store user name and number in two variables   var userNumber  variable userNumber is now equal to   askNumber    var userName  variable userName is now set to   askName    print out the new variables    console.loguserNumber   console.loguserName    print who the phone number belongs to, this lets me see that the above code worked correctly   var userNumber  askNumber   var userName  askName   console.logPhone number   userNumber   belongs to   userName    make new customer object with the given name and number   var userNumber  new Customer   userNumber.name  askName   userNumber.phonenumber  askNumber    console.logproperties of   userNumber     codepre  pthe last bit returns properties of [object, object] whyp

When loading the site at times it loads completely, but when logging a user in it takes forever to authenticate such that it produces an codeInternal Server Errorcode.p  pStep 1 I have checked the cache directory for both persistent and models and they are clean.p  pStep 2 The Configurewrite value for debug is already set to 2. Nothing gets written on the error.log file.p  pCould this have anything to do with Session data I am trying to figure out whats going on and I have tried looking into the lib folder for Cake to see if I can edit the files in there to actually see what the website actually outputs instead of the codeInternal Server Errorcode message. Which file should I edit in there I followed a hrefhttpwww.geekyboy.comarchives341 relnofollowthisa link but it seems like the core is a different version.p

Negative 78022 pI am working on web application upgrade which involves below two upgrades p  pJSF 1.0  2.x ,  Webspehere 7.0  8.5p  pAfter upgrade if I switch to  myfaces libs provided in WAS8.5 plugins, certain elements in UI tend to break. If I keep the implementaion to mojjara JSF2.0 libs, it seems to work fine.p  pOne of the errors I am getting when I use myFaces 2.0 is p  precodejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException Component javax.faces.component.UIInput is no javax.faces.component.html.HtmlInputText codepre  pThis happened because codeltinputTextgtcode which is of type codejavax.faces.component.html.HtmlInputTextcode tag had a binding to a model which returned codenew UIInputcode in codegettercode method of codemodelcode. I know this is a bad code. But its existing and was written to initialize text field with default valuesp  pI can understand why this should not work. Because codeHtmlInputTextcode is a subClass of codeUIInputcode. And when we try to bind object of codeParentcode class where codeChildcode class is expected, this error is thrown. This is similar to when we try to cast a Parent Object to Child referencep  pNow if this is the case, then my question is how same code works with Mojjara JSF implementation. If I switch to Mojjara, I dont face this issue, which is surprising. Because I expected this issue with this also, since code violates general Parent Child Class rules. p

Negative 78022 pI am having trouble getting bash to relinquish control of the pipe to stdin.

First, it cats the usernamepassword files and then pipes that into codepianobarcode pandora in the terminal. The username and password get in there, however, pianobar is expecting more input. Pianobar is asking for a number to be able to play, for example, station em12em, but when I type and hit enter, nothing happens because for some reason, it isnt expecting it to come from there.p  pHow do I get the pipe to relinquish controlp  pNote I have also triedp  precodeecho cat .musikname cat .musikpass  base64 decode   gtgtgt pianobar codepre

Negative 78022 pIs there a way to execute text as Razor code  I am storing the HTMLJavaScript of a form in a database field.

For examplep  precodeltp classformcontrolstatic idrequestedbygtUser.Identity.GetUserNameltpgt codepre  pUnfortunately, when this is pulled in and rendered, the value of the field is just the text User.Identity.GetUserName as opposed to the value returned from that method.p  pIf you are curious as to why I am doing things this way, the form needs to be completely dynamic based on who is logging in.

I am definitely open to some other ideas if you have them.p  pHere are the solutions that I was able to consider thus farp  pStore field names and attributes in the database and dynamically create the form through iteration.  The issue here is that some of the fields are grouped into fieldsets, some have addons, some parts require custom buttons, etc.  This could definitely be done but I think it is way overengineering and forcing a solution.p  pBuild the form in HTMLJavaScriptRazor and store all of the field names in the database with associated user IDs.  Conditionally show the fields based on whether or not the loggedin user has access to that field.  codePseudo  ifuser.FormFields.Containsfieldname ...codep  pAnd the solution I am attempting now  Store all HTMLJavaScriptRazor in database as text and render with codeHtml.RawHtmlFromDatabasecode.

Negative 78022 pHow do I get numeric values from the RepresentationModelp  pSay, after traversing a document, I have a codeYamlScalarNodecode. It has a codestring Valuecode, which I can, of course, try to convert to a number, but Id expect YAML to detect the type and present it as codeintcode or codedoublecode etc. perhaps via descendants from codeYamlScalarNodecode, whose type I could detect.p  pIs there an official way to do it that Im missingp  pNote that I cant use codeSerializationcode the document structure does not directly map to a class it can be a recursive definition of arbitrary depth, and the end values are either scalar numbers or sequences of numbers vectors.p  pAlso, can YamlDotNet handle numerical keys in mappings This means that keys 1 and 01 should be considered duplicates. I believe YAML specification requires that, but Im not certain...p

The problem is, when a user tries to log in from different browsers at the same time, only the latest log in session is retained and the older ones are expiring. p  pFor example  I sign in to Odoo using google on chrome and then sign in on Mozilla firefox. At this point if I refresh my page on chrome where I signed in, I will be logged out and will be asked to sign in again but Im still signed in on firefox.p  pAfter a lot of considerations, it came to my mind that probably the old refresh tokens are expiring. However on the official docs, I saw thisp  blockquote   pA token might stop working for one of these reasonsp      ul   liThe user has revoked access.li   liThe token has not been used for six months.li   liThe user account has exceeded a certain number of token requests.li   ul blockquote  pIf this is not the case then why cant I stay signed in from multiple browsers at the same time What should I do in order to stay signed in using google from multiple browsersp  pAny help would be appreciatedp
