Positive 3326 pAll right, Im currently trying to fully understand how all the positioning code works and to make everything responsive in my website.  Every bug Ive come across Ive been able to fix myself through research online and constant staring lol.  However, Ive come across a rather irritating issue...p  pTHE ISSUE I have a div that is positioned relative id newscontent and is within a div that is positioned absolute id page.  When I try to move newscontent using positioning commands top and left, left is the only one that is reacting.

Positive 3326 pIm very new to Python, so dumbeddown explanations will be greatly appreciated. I have data that I have read in from a csv file that I have manipulated to be in the form [t1,n1,v1,t2,n2,v2,t3,n3,v3,...]p  pWhat Im trying to do is, given a nonzero value in v, find the position of the next occurrence of n that has a zero value for v, and determine the difference in t values.  Here is my code so farp  precoded[] for i,x in enumeratelist     if x[2]0         for j,y in enumeratelist             if x[1]y[1] and jgti and y[2]0                 d.appendy[0]x[0]     else d.append0  print d codepre  pI did this in excel using MATCH and OFFSET functions, but Im a bit lost transitioning to index and enumerate here.p  pMy first problem is that the nested for loop doesnt stop when it finds the first match, and so it keeps appending t value differences for every matching n value.  Id only like to find the first match.p  pMy second query is if theres a better way to do this, so the nested for loop isnt always starting at the beginning of my list, and instead starts at the index i.  Im dealing with quite large data sets.p  pEDIT I managed to make it work, though its quite inelegant times and notes are lists of the 1st and 2nd elements of each tuple in listp  precoded[] for i,x in enumeratelist     if x[2]0         d.appendnotes[i1].indexx[1]     else d.appendNA   dur[] for i,j in enumerated     if jNA         dur.appendtimes[ij1]times[i]     else dur.append0 codepre  pId appreciate any ideas on a cleaner solution.p

When a new user registers, an element drops down from the top telling them to check their email for their password. When that element is activated, it pushes the page down but the absolute element overlaps this box. Im still learning JS and just dont know enough yet to make a conditional script that runs an positon script.. if thats even how it would workp  pThis is the css for the element     glttranslatetrigger     position absolute     top 14px     right 0px     bottom auto     margin 0 3 0 5     background c3d73f     p  pThis is the script that activates the notification elementp  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction jQuery.frontendnotification.addClassshown  jQuery.frontendnotification i.fatimes.onclick, function jQuery.frontendnotification.addClasshidden setTimeoutfunction jQuery.frontendnotification.remove ,2000   codepre

Positive 3326 pIm using .Net c winforms. I want to move my mouse over another application and see the cusor X,Y position as I move the mouse over its interface. Displaying the X,Y on my forms title bar is ok. I want to see the X,Y location for a specific spot on this apps form.p  pThe reason I want to do this is because there are controls on this apps interface that I can mouse click on to turn a knob, one mouse click per knob turn. I want to write an app that I can position the mouse cursor to that specific X,Y position on this app form and then do a software mouse click to turn that same knob one turn. But I want to do this from my app, kind of like remote control I guess you could say. The other app knobs responds to mouse clicks when you are over the correct X,Y location.p  pThanks for any pointers in the right direction.p

Positive 3326 pIm implementing a fixed vertcial menu, it works great on desktop and looks great on mobile devices IOS, Android ...as long as you dont zoom in on the page. When you zoom on a mobile device the fixed element begins covering the other page content as it should since its fixed to a certain place on the viewport. but where im looking for is a navigaton bar thats only fixed vertically. So if you zoom in and scroll horizontally the navigation bar doesnt cover the content. Is there a way to do thisp  pThanksp

Whenever codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode is called, I block it with a mutex so I can run the filtergraph in pull mode.  When Im ready for another frame, I unblock the mutex in my main thread and wait for codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode to send me a signal that its done.  For some videos, codeIMediaDetgetStreamLengthcode tells me that the video has more frames than really exist.  Once Ive extracted the final frame and request one more than actually exists, the main thread then blocks forever because codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode will never get called again.  Id like to be able to detect when codeSampleGrabberSampleCBcode will never be called for file sources.  Applications like Windows Media Player are able to somehow do this because the GUI reports that the video has ended after the last real frame, so apparently theres a way to do this.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIm using codeWaitForSingleObjectcode to implement the main thread blocking.  The workaround that Ive been using so far is to do what Greg suggested have a finite timeout.  Unfortunately, this gets a little tricky.

Negative 3326 pI have an application which potentially does thousands of inserts to a SQL Server 2005 database. If an insert fails for any reason foreign key constraint, field length, etc. the application is designed to log the insert error and continue.p  pEach insert is independent of the others so transactions arent needed for database integrity.

Negative 3326 pI am writing a clientserver in linux kernel Yes. Inside the kernel. Its design decision taken and finalised. Its not going to changep  pThe server reads incoming packets from a raw socket. The transport protocol for these packets on which the raw socket is listening is custom and UDP like. In short I do not have to listen for incoming connections and then fork a thread to handle that connection.p  pI have to just process any IP datagram coming on that raw socket. I will keep reading for packets in an infinite loop on the raw socket. In the userlevel equivalent program, I would have created a separate thread and kept listening for incoming packets. p  pNow for kernel level server, I have doubts about whether I should run it in a separate thread or not becausep  ol lipI think read is an IO operation. So somewhere inside the read, kernel must be calling schedule function to relinquish the control of the processor. Thus after calling read on raw socket, the current kernel active context will be put on hold put in a sleep queue maybe until the packets are available. As and when packets will arrive, the kernel interrupt context will signal that the read context, which is sleeping in the queue, is once again ready to run. I am using context here on purpose instead of thread. Thus I should not require a separate kernel thread.pli lipOn the other hand, if read does not relinquish the control then entire kernel will be blocked. pli ol  pCan anyone provide tips about how should I design my server What is the fallacy of the argument presented in point 1p

Negative 3326 pI am programming a simple C console application.p  pThe spec isp  pA game consists of ten frames, which start with a full rack of ten pins. In each frame, you have two deliveries of your ball, in which to knock down as many of the ten pins as you can. If you knock down all the pins on your first ball, it is called a strike. The score doesnt get added on straight away because for a strike you get the values of your next two balls as a bonus. For example, if you score a strike in the first frame, then a 7 and 1 in the second frame, you would score 18 1071 for the first frame, and 8 for the second frame, making a total of 26 after two frames. If you knock down some of the pins on the first ball, and knock down the remainder of the pins in the second ball, it is known as a spare. Again, the score doesnt get added on straight away because for a spare, you get the values of your next ball as a bonus. For example, if you score a spare in the first frame, say a 6 and a 4, then got an 8 and a 1 in the second frame, you would score 18 648 for the first frame, and 9 for the second frame, making a total of 27 after two frames.p  pI understand how to write the code etc. etc. However, I just cannot get my head around the best way of doing this scoring system and I need some advice. Obviously a new object will be created for each player, however I am not sure of how to get round what seemed like a simple programming problem initially.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pRegardsp

Negative 3326 pI really need an answer to this question. I am working on a project which uses XML to make pages, then XSLT to produce it to a web page.

Negative 3326 pIve got an object that is being serialized  deserialized via the XmlSerializer in C, .NET 3.5. One of the properties and more in the future is a collection List where T is an enum value. This serializes  deserializes fine.p  pWe are also using a default values mechanism to provide default values for the object, in case the serialized version doesnt have any value set. as a simple example, here is what we are dongp  precodepublic enum MyEnum    Value1,   Value2   public class Foo     public List SomeSetting get set     public Foo        SomeSetting  new List     SomeSetting.AddMyEnum.Value1     SomeSetting.AddMyEnum.Value2     codepre  pThis code works fine for setting the default values of SomeSetting when the object is constructed. p  pHowever, when we are deserializing an xml file that has values for SomeSetting, this default value setup is causing problems the xml deserializer does not reset the SomeSetting collection  it does not wipe it clean and populate with new data. Rather, it adds on to the data that is already there. So, if the xml file has Value1 serialized into it, when I deserialize that file, i end up with SomeSettings having Value1, Value2, Value1 as the values being stored.p  pI need a way for the xml deserialization process to allow my default values to exist when there is no data for SomeSetting in the xml document, and also to wholesale replace the SomeSetting values when there is data in the xml document. How can I do thisp  pFYI  this is not the only property in the document. The document does exist, and is being serialized  deserialized for the other simple values. This is the property that is causing problems, though. I have to support this scenario because I need to do this a lot, now.p

Negative 3326 pWe are trying to implement a proxy proof of concept but have encountered an interesting question Since a single HTTP connection can, and indeed should, make multiple requests, and the HTTP transactions are sent via multiple packets due to TCPs magic, is it possible for a HTTP request to begin in the middle of a packetp  pBear in mind that this is not a theoretical question regarding possible optimization of the browser, but whether it actually happens in real life.

Negative 3326 pIn our Cocoon environment we have a few forms with textareas. Once the user submits a form, an overview is displayed before the final submit is done. Therefor, each formobjects data is stored in POJOs. If the user is on that overview page and decides to go back to the form, the form is filled with the already submitted data read from the POJOs. However, when filling the textarea with data from the JavaObject, some linebreaks and whitespaces are added to the data. I checked the POJOs data for these linebreaks but the String looks clean. Each whitespace entered by the user is of Character 32, which is a simple space.p  pI also checked the Serializer we use a custom one that extends Cocoons AbstractSerializer but no linebreakswhitespaces added by accident here.p  pWhen using Javascript to output the current content of that Textarea though, it contains linebreak characters n as well as the aforementioned additional whitespaces.p  pMy suspicion is that the conversion from Javas SpaceCharacter to HTMLs space characters somehow fails. These linebreaks appear instead of spaces, not inside a single word. They also change position depending on the textareas size. They are not at the end of a line, so they cant be forced by wrap or something.p  pExample User input test test test test test becomes testn [36x Space] test test test testp

Please let me start off by giving you some background information.p  pFirst, I started off by modifying Apples glPaint demo app. I think its a great source, since it shows you how to set up the EAGLView, etc...p  pNow, what I wanted to do next, was to implement zooming functionality. After doing some research, I tried two different approaches.p  p1 use glOrthof p  p2 change the frame size of my EAGLView.p  pWhile both ways allow me to perfectly zoom in  out, I experience different problems, when it actually comes to painting while zoomed in.p  pWhen I use 1, I have to render the view like thisp  precodeglMatrixModeGLPROJECTION glLoadIdentity glOrthofleft, right, bottom, top, 1.0f, 1.0f those values have been previously calculated glDisableGLBLEND Im using Apples Texture2D class here to render an image [textures[kTextureMyImage] drawInRect[self bounds]] glEnableGLBLEND [self swapBuffers] codepre  pNow, lets assume I zoom in a little, THEN I paint and after that, I want to zoom out again. In order to get this to work, I need to make sure that kTextureMyImage always contains the latest changes. In order to do that, I need to capture the screen contents after changes have been made and merge them with the original image. The problem here is, that when I zoom in, my screen only shows part of the image enlarged and I havent found a proper way to deal with this yet.p  pI tried to calculate which part of the screen was enlarged, then do the capturing. After that Id resize this part to its original size and use yet another method to paste it into the original image at the correct position.p  pNow, I could go more into detail on how I achieved this, but its really complicated and I figured, there has to be an easier way. There are already several apps out there, that perfectly do, what Im trying to achieve, so it must be possible.p  pAs far as approach 2 goes, I can avoid most of the above, since I only change the size of my EAGLView window. However, when painting, the strokes are way off their expected position. I probably need take the zoom level into account when painting and recalculate the CGPoints in a different way.p  pHowever, if you have done similar things in the past or can give me a hint, how I could implement zooming into my painting app, Id really appreciate it.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 3326 pWe have a requirement to determine whether an incoming InputStream is a reference to an zip file or zip data. We do not have reference to the underlying source of the stream. We aim to copy the contents of this stream into an OutputStream directed at an alternate location.p  pI tried reading the stream using ZipInputStream and extracting a ZipEntry. The ZipEntry is null if the stream is a regular file  as expected  however, in checking for a ZipEntry I loose the initial couple of bytes from the stream. Hence, by the time I know that the stream is a regular stream, I have already lost initial data from the stream.p  pAny thoughts around how to check if the InputStream is an archive without data loss would be helpful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 3326 pLot of profiling shows that C streams are not the best way to performe file or text string manipulation when performance speed is required. Still, the standard streams are a good way to keep things typesafe.p  pFrom what Ive read, most of the problem is because streams implementations have to 1 createcopy a lot of little objects 2 arnt fully generic dont manage char and wchar the same way etc.p  pAnyway, I was thinking that maybe some C0x would allow implementers to limit at least object creationcopy and maybe there are other features that would allow other performance improvements, maybe allowing to reach the printf performancep  pIs there an immediate impact Or will we have to wait for new implementations Or do we still need a new STLlike stream libraryp

Negative 3326 pI have an app Ive recently converted from a VS 2008 .NET 3.5 project, to a VS2010 .NET 4 project. Some of the WPF dialogs in the project behave differently after the conversion. Id like to understand what is causing this difference in behaviour, so I can find and fix other areas that may now have problems.p  pAs an example, I have a MVVM dialog that lets the user type in a number. The number is stored internally as a double, and the user can only accept the dialog if the text they type is a valid double. So I have a text box bound to a string in the ViewModel, and an OK button which is only enabled when the string is a valid double.

For example, if the user enters 3.05555 into the text box on the .NET 3.5 version, everything is fine. However in the .NET 4 version, they can enter 3.05 fine but when they type the next 5 the value of text box changes to 3.06 and then changes to 3.07 if they press 5 again. Its as if the value is being readback from the codeValueStringcode property as soon as it has been set thus being formatted as G3, but this didnt used to happen with .NET 3.5.p  pIve had a look over a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb613588.aspx relnofollowWhats New in the .NET Framework 4a including a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb613588.aspx relnofollowWhats New in WPF Version 4a, but I didnt find anything about this change.p  pIf you want to see this for yourself, Ive created a small example VS2010 solution you can a hrefhttpwww.nonlinear.comtempbindingtest.zip relnofollowdownload from herea.

Negative 3326 pIm trying to create a basic Pacman game in C Ill use Java syntax in this question as this is somewhat easier to demonstrate, but I cant find a good design option.p  pSo far I have 4 classesbr  Monster Can be subclassed for monsterspecific behaviour and contains all logic for the monstersbr  Player Contains playerlogicbr  Map Contains a 2d array representing the map. This array specifies which positions are walls or Pacman foodbr  Game contains a Player, a Map and a list of Monsters.p  pTo keep it simplep  precodepublic class Game    Player player   Map map   ArrayListltMonstergt monsters    public Game      player  new Player     map  new Map     monsters  new ArrayListltMonster     monsters.addnew ScaryMonster     monsters.addnew DumpMonster       public void update      player.update     map.update      for Monster monster monsters        monster.update         public void draw      map.draw     player.draw      for Monster monster monsters        monster.draw     codepre  pSo all I have to do now is to create a Game object and call update and draw on it every time. Very simple. But it doesnt work.p  pAssume I call update on the playerobject and the player which is the Pacman ofcourse hits food. In that case, the mapobject should get notified of this and the position to remove the food from the 2darray. Assume the player kills a monster, the position of the monster should get changed the Monster class has a position field. And you can imagine a lot more of these situations.p  pAn option would be to pass the map and monster object as parameters in the update and draw method of the player object. And to pass the player and monster objects as parameters in the method calls of map. But that surely doesnt sound like a good OO design.p  pWhats a good OO way to solve this I was thinking about using the Observer pattern so Game is the subject, player, map and monsters are observers, but that doesnt make any sense that way the observers will have to let the subject know of any changes, which is obviously not the correct way of using this.p  pAny tips would be very welcome.p  pThank you very much p

Negative 3326 pI have two classes which look like this in barebones formp  precodeinterface GraphNode      NSMutableArray edges   implementation GraphNode  idinitWithCoderNSCoder coder      if self  [super init]          edges  [coder decodeObjectForKeyedges]          return self   voidencodeWithCoderNSCodercoder      [coder encodeObjectedges forKeyedges]   end  interface GraphEdges    NSMutableArray edges   implementation GraphEdges  idinitWithCoderNSCoder coder      if self  [super init]          edges  [coder decodeObjectForKeyedges]          return self   voidencodeWithCoderNSCodercoder      [coder encodeObjectedges forKeyedges]   end codepre  pYoull notice they seem to express the same behaviour  encodingdecoding an NSMutableArray whose contents are objects of a type GraphEdge which implements NSCoding. The difference between the classes in practise is that GraphEdges creates edges in its codeedgescode property, while GraphNode adds to its own codeedgescode only references to alreadyexisting GraphEdge instances in GraphEdges.edges .p  pMy issue is that when decoding GraphNode and GraphEdges objects the object graph is not maintained since each class creates its own versions of the original GraphEdge objects stored in the codeedgescode property for each class.p  pI tried to do an encodeConditionalObject on the whole NSMutableArray edges in GraphNode while keeping the encode in GraphEdges unconditional, but unsurprisingly this simply fails to encode GraphNode.edges as the condition is placed on the array itself, not its objects.p  pIs the solution to iterate through the arrays in both cases, and perform conditional encoding on each codeedgescode member for GraphNode but unconditional encoding for each member of codeedgescode in GraphEdgesp  pAny advice is appreciated, many thanks.p
Negative 3326 pApologies if this has already been asked and answered Ive looked around a bunch but havent found exactly what Im asking.p  pp  ol lipSuppose my web app at a hrefhttpexample.comhttpexample.coma uses a private and undocumented web API at a hrefhttpapi.example.comhttpapi.example.coma to fetch data, e.g. via XHR or JSONP.pli lipAlso suppose that this web app is anonymous mdash it does emnotem require user login.pli lipSince theres communication between client and server, anyone can open Fiddler, etc. to see the exact request and response, not to mention inspect the clientside JS code.pli ol  pIn a case like this, how can you prevent someone from using your API in a strongemnonwebemstrong client app E.g. an iPhone app, or serverside.p  pTo my understanding, point 2 removes the option of something like OAuth, and point 3 removes the option of e.g. API keys or even SSL.p  pIve thought about things like timebased tokens or secret salts that are injected into the page on first load, but an iPhone app could easily just secretly load your webpage before making API requests.p  pSo is there any way besides just plain obfuscation mdash security through obscurityp  pp  pIn case all that is too abstract, heres a simple examplep  pGoogle.com fetches its autocomplete data via some API thats private and undocumented mdash but open on the web.

Negative 3326 pI have 2 questions regarding the so common Target Unreachable Exception. Whats the best practice to handle it, for example you have Country has City, City has Street.   do you put in Countrys constructor new City, and in Citys constructor new Street  so that you somehow have them into a centralized place, but always make objects which you might not need  OR you initialize the objects in various places in your code where you need them  spread all over your code  and if the user doesnt type anything say for Street, in order to prevent the insertion of a blank row in the DB  you put the street back to null. Wheres the best place to put it back to null  say you have Cascade.ALL or Extended Context, otherwise youd just not save it if you knew its emptyp  pPS why isnt JSF just instantiating what it needs, and Hibernate not persisting entities that have all persistent fields empty   For performance or why  Yet again, is it bad to have empty rows in db, just with PK and FKs p

Negative 3326 panother developer and I are in the process of building a site, we implemented our own OOP model which we had a lot of discussion on, but it seems Ive run into a brick wall. strongPlease bear with mestrongp  pAll our classes extend Object, which has a constructor, which uses getcalledclass to get the class, and then getclassvars etc to load column names, which means we can have a save, delete, displayExisting, getAll, and a few other methods in a class by default, which eliminates a lot of code. This is good. Now, I have a class InboundData, this has 3 classes extend off of itself, called Visit, Enquiry, and BrochureRequest, they have an inbounddataid, then InboundData has an overloaded constructor looking something like thisp  precodefunction constructid           thisgtclassName  getcalledclass     thisgtid  intid     thisgttableName  strtolowerthisgtclassName     thisgtsetDbFields     thisgtloadData      thisgtcontact  new Contactthisgtcontactid     thisgtaddress  new Addressthisgtaddressid     thisgtdomain  new Domainthisgtdomainid     thisgtpark  new Parkthisgtparkid  codepre  pThe problem is, that contact, address, domain, and park are all protected, as to stop Objects methods from picking them up as column namesclass vars.

Negative 3326 pThis may be more of a theoretical question.  I have a scenario wherein there is a compressed file 2 GB that gets decompressed into a larger file 22GB.  This process takes roughly 20 minutes, which in turn means I am wasting about 19 minutes and 59 seconds every time this process gets run.  My question is the following  Is it possible to open up a stream from the file that is being decompressed and pass the information to a separate program that will manipulate the data  Essentially every line in the file is a record, but I have been unable to find a technique to discover when a line has been fully decoded during decompression.

Negative 3326 pIm working on my first android app and am having a problem trying to implement the Vibrator. What Im trying to do is have the AlertDialog display a message, and because the user might not actually have been running the app at the time, play an alarm and vibrate the phone until they close the alert. First I had it working just fine without the vibrator, then when I implemented the vibrator it stopped the alarm sound, and it no longer displayed the AlertDialog. I found out I was able to fix the problem with the alarm by executing it in a new Thread, but still no AlertDialog. So then I tried moving the Vibrator to a new Thread as well and that did not fix my problem. So my current issue is, the phone plays the alarm sound and vibrates, but the AlertDialog Im telling it to show never gets displayed.

Negative 3326 pFYI I am a beginner. Also, I understand that calling methods is a novice concept and there are a few threads like this already.

Negative 3326 pThis is in the context of the Microsoft C Concurrency API.p  pTheres a class called codeagentcode under codeConcurrencycode namespace, and its basically a state machine you derive and implement pure virtual codeagentruncode.p  pNow, it is your responsibility to call codeagentstartcode, which will put it in a emrunnableem state. You then call codeagentwaitcode, or any of its variants, to actually execute the codeagentruncode method.p  pBut why do we have to call codeagentdonecode within the body I mean, the obvious answer is that codeagentwaitcode will wait until done is signaled or the timeout has elapsed, but...p  pWhat were the designers intending Why not have the agent enter the done state when codeagentruncode returns Thats what I want to know. Why do I have the option to not call codedonecode The wait methods throw exceptions if the timeout has elapsed.p

Negative 3326 pI need to develop an iterator over a filesystem subtree in Java. The state of the filesystem might change while the iteration is still in progress e.g. new folders and files get created and deleted. The iterator should therefore first capture a snapshot of the hierarchy e.g. crawl the tree and save the names of all files found to a list and then iterate over the snapshot.p  pstrongI am wondering if it is a good idea or not to put the code to create the cache into the iterators constructor.strong An alternative would be to designate a speciall method for that named codeinitcode.p  pThe size and depth of the iterated subtree might get quite large and the caching will therefore be time consuming. Moreover, it might throw IOExceptions I am still not sure if it is good design practice to throw exceptions from constructors in Java.p  pOn the other hand, creating a dedicated method to initialize the iterator would mean the client code could not use the iterator as simply an implementation of the Iterator interface.p  pThe client code would also be responsible for calling the init method prior to the traversal. I could have the codehasNextcodecodenextcode methods first make sure that the iterator has been initialized and if not, call the codeinitcode method from within them. But that would mean the first call to these methods would be significantly slower than the next ones without any reasons visible from the client side.p

Negative 3326 pI want to automatically execute many buttons clicking only on the first, so I used in each buttonp  precodewebBrowser1.DocumentCompleted      new WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventHandlerButton2Click codepre  pHowever the program crashes. How I can start the execution of several methods one by one each method must wait until the previous endsp  pto simplify, my first method must load a web page, the second must fill in the fields existing in the page back. when I execute these two methods separately all goes well, but if I execute in a single button the two methods Method1  method2  it gives me an error on line HtmlElement  webBrowser1.Document.GetElementById txtbox txtbox1 it does not find the element, so could be the page has not yet been download, so I put each method in a button, and I added to the first button, the line webBrowser1.DocumentCompleted   new WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventHandler Button2Click so when the webbrowser download page, the button will execute the second, but still the same error can not find txtbox1.p

Negative 3326 pRecently I used a nice gem created by a single developer, which is hosted on Github.p  pDuring my work, I had to modify it somewhat substantially, adding some improvements.  Some were projectspecific, others were gemspecific, and others were, well, standalone improvements.p  pFor the gemspecific improvements e.g., a bugfix, I forked the repo, applied the fix, and made a pull request.p  pThen, however, I noticed that the standalone improvements kind of fell into the category of a parallel, ongoing, fork of the original gem.  To be clearer, youve seen it before I rewrote the views of the original gem to work with the Twitter Bootstrap framework.  So, I pushed this up to Github as well, but, of course, didnt make a pull requestinstead, I updated the README to explain what was different, and to credit the original author of the gem.p  pMy question is, what else is one supposed to do in this case, presuming the gem is something anyone else wants to use and is to be published on rubygems, etc  Should I simply edit the .gemspec and keep the original authors info intact, but augment my information to the authorsemail fields, and rewrite whatever else has changed  Or should one completely rewrite the .gemspecp  pAlso, if the original distro has in place remote testing frameworks like strongtravis.ymlstrong, should these be removed, or left in placep  pAre there other files that generally must be changedrecreatedp  pSo far I have updatedp  precode.gemspec README.md CHANGELOG.md liblibrarynameVERSION.rb called as a constant in .gemspec codepre  pThe last one raises a separate bonus question in itself, how does versioning work in parallel distrosp

Negative 3326 pDo you know of a python library that can approximate the font width of a given string of text p  pPerhaps a library with something similar top  precodedef getApproximateFontWidththestring, fontnameArial, fontsize12    return ... picas or pixels or something similar ... codepre  pIm not looking for anything very rigorous, an approximation will be fine. p  pThe motivation for this is that I am generating a truncated string in my webapps backend and sending it to the frontend to be displayed. Most of the time the strings are lower case, but sometimes the strings are in all caps, making them very wide. If the string isnt properly trucated it looks ugly. Id like to know how much to truncate the strings based on their approximate width. If its off by 10 its not a big deal, this is a cosmetic feature.p

Negative 3326 pIn the Java world, when it comes to developing unit tests, Ive followed an approach of testing to the interface.  What that means is, if I have a Java interface, I would write a single unit test class extending from JUnits TestCase or whatever for that interface to test that interface.  This class would be abstract, and would contain a series of test methods for testing the methods of my interface.  Heres a quick examplep  precode my interface  public interface MyFooInterface      int foo     String bar    some implementation  public class MyFooImplA implements MyFooInterface      public int foo  ...      public String bar  ...     some other implementation  public class MyFooImplB implements MyFooInterface      public int foo  ...      public String bar  ...     my test case for my interface  public abstract TestMyFooInterface extends TestCase       private MyFooInterface objUnderTest      public abstract MyFooInterface getMyFooInterface      public void setUp          objUnderTest  getMyFooInterface           public void testFoo          ... bunch of assertions on objUnderTest...           public void testBar          ... bunch of assertions on objUnderTest...         concrete test class, with very little work to do  public TestMyFooImplA extends TestMyFooInterface      public MyFooInterface getMyFooInterface          return new MyFooImplA         another concrete test class, with very little work to do  public TestMyFooImplB extends TestMyFooInterface      public MyFooInterface getMyFooInterface          return new MyFooImplB       codepre  pSo here we have a great thing.  No matter how many implementations of MyFooInterface we have, we only need to write 1 set of unit tests in TestMyFooInterface.java to ensure the contractual correctness of MyFooInterface.  Then, we simply need a concrete test case for each interface implementation we have.  These concrete test cases are boring all they need to do is provide an implementation of getMyFooInterface and they do this simply by constructing the correct implementation class.  Now, when I run these tests, every test method in TestMyFooInterface will be invoked for each concrete test class.  By the way, when I say when I run these tests, what that means is, an instance of TestMyFooImplA will be created because its a concrete test case found by the test harness something Antbased or Mavenbased or whatever and all of its test methods will be run i.e., all the methods from TestMyFooInterface.  TestMyFooImplB will also be instantiated, and its test methods will be run.  Bam  We only had to write a single set of test methods, and theyll be run for every concrete test case implementation we create which only takes a couple lines of codep  pWell, I want to mirror this same approach in Clojure when it comes to Protocols and Records, but Ive stumbled a bit.  Also, I want to validate if this approach is even reasonable or not in the Clojure universe.  p  pHeres what I have in Clojure so far.  Heres my interfacep  precodens myabstractions  defprotocol MyFooProtocol     foo [this] returns some int     bar [this] returns some string codepre  pAnd now I might have 2 different implementations of this protocol, in the form of records.  Heres one implementationp  precodens myfooaimpl     use [myabstractions]  defrecord MyFooAImplementation [fielda fieldb]     MyFooProtocol     foo [this] ...impl here...     bar [this] ...impl here... codepre  pAnd one other implementationp  precodens myfoobimpl     use [myabstractions]  defrecord MyFooBImplementation [field1 field2]     MyFooProtocol     foo [this] ...impl here...     bar [this] ...impl here... codepre  pSo at this point, Im sort of in the same position I was in my familiar OO Java world.  I have 2 implementations of my MyFooProtocol protocol.  Each implementations foo and bar functions should be obeying the contract of the functions as documented in MyFooProtocol.  p  pIn my mind, I only want to create a set of tests once for foo and bar, even though I have multiple implementations, just as I did in my Java example.  So heres what I did next with my Clojure code.  I created my testsp  precodens myfooprotocoltests  defn testFoo [foof myFoo]     let [fooResult foof myFoo]       ...some expression that returns a boolean...  defn testBar [barf myBar]     let [barResult barf myBar]       ...some expression that returns a boolean... codepre  pGreat, Ive written my tests only once.  Each function above returns a boolean, effectively representing some test use case  assertion.  In reality, Id have many, many more of these for each assertion Id want to do.  Now, I need to create my implementation test cases.  Well, since Clojure is not OO, I cant really do what I did in my Java example above, so this is what I was thinkingp  precodens myfooATests     use [myfooprotocoltests only [testFoo testBar]]     import [myfooaimpl MyFooAImplementation]     use [abstractions]     require [myfooaimpl]     use [clojure.test]  deftest testForFoo []     is testFoo myfooaimplfoo MyFooAImplementation. a b  deftest testForBar []     is testBar myfooaimplbar MyFooAImplementation. a b codepre  pAnd now for the other test case implementationp  precodens myfooBTests     use [myfooprotocoltests only [testFoo testBar]]     import [myfoobimpl MyFooAImplementation]     use [abstractions]     require [myfoobimpl]     use [clojure.test]  deftest testForFoo []     is testFoo myfoobimplfoo MyFooBImplementation. 1 2  deftest testForBar []     is testBar myfoobimplbar MyFooBImplementation. 1 2 codepre  pMy 2 concrete test implementations myFooATests and myFooBTests namespaces look verbose, but all they are really doing is delegating the assertion logic to my testFoo and testBar functions in the myfooprotocoltests namespace.  Its just boilerplate code.p  pBut theres a snag.  In the last 2 listings, the first parameter to testFoo and testBar is myfooimplfoo or myfooimplbar where  is a or b.  But this doesnt work because foo and bar functions are buried inside the defprotocol, and I cannot access them this way.  p  pBecause Im pretty much learning Clojure in isolation, I wanted to reach out to the SO community and try to get some help.  Firstly, is what Im doing here in my Clojure code look remotely reasonable  I.e., this idea of trying to test to the interface err, protocol once  is this a worthy goal in the Clojure universe  the DRY in me says so as does the OO practitioner in me.  If my interpretation of the relationship between protocols and records in Clojure is correct i.e., a form of interface and implementation buddies, then I really only want to write my tests once as I tried to do in the myfooprotocoltests namespace.  p  pAnd secondly, assuming all of this is sane, how can I effectively pass the foo and bar functions that are defined inside the defrecords of the myfooaimpl and myfoobimpl namespaces  What is the syntax for getting at themp  pThank you for your time.p

When I added a new field to one of my models, it would change the database for me.p  pHowever, I am getting ready for production and everything I have read, including the a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation1.2.2evolutions relnofollowplay documentationa says to turn that feature off and to instead use evolutions. However, as I am writing my 1.sql file, I am running into several issuesp  ul liI have arrays as part of my model and I am unsure as to how they are represented in the databaseli liParts of the model are instances of other models and I am unsure as to how objects are represented in the databaseli ul  pUntil now, I didnt have to worry about how the database was actually constructed because PlayJPAHibernate provided a level of abstraction. But now that it seems I need to manually create the tables myself, I cant find any documentation for the right way to do this.p  pDo I need to manually write the SQL to create the tables for my models and if so, how do I represent these in the databasep  pstrongEDITstrong I am using play 1.2.4p

Negative 3326 pIm having an architecture difficulty with application designed in Backbone. p  pIve got cascaded, stronghierarchical viewsstrong, i.e. root view has header, middle and footer views. Each of them consists of some lower level views, e.g. header view consists of tabs, preferences and loginlogout views. Its just a view aggregation.p  pI also have a strongconfiguration modelstrong, which has several attributes, its loaded via AJAX standard backbone fetch. The model attributes are displayed in the interface using popups, menus etc. to enable the user to choose his settings. When the user changes a setting, possibly many parts of the app will have to rerender. The configuration model holds state properties e.g. property codecurrentPeriodcode is used among codeperiodscode which were fetched via AJAXp  pInside views, I use codelistenTothis.model, changecurrentPeriod, this.rendercode to make this view strongrerender when anything is changedstrong in the configuration.p  pI set all my default state attributes inside modelcodeparsecode. The problem is that if I have 10 attributes to set after parse is over and probably each of them will trigger some events, many of them will be run multiple times which is not what I want.p  pI was looking for a possibility to set current state attributes inside parse with the silenttrue option  then no events would be triggered. I hope some of you already had the same problem and there exists an easy solution. Thanks in advancep
Negative 3326 pI am developing a C tool to read 8 gb of hex data from an unformatted SD card.p  pIt is able to do so, but it randomly throws File Not Found Exception. For instance, it will read a gigabyte or two, then throw it. Other times it will read all 8 gbs a few times in a row, then throw the exception. In other words, it appears to pop up completely randomly.p  pI have no idea what might be causing it. p  pEDIT I have used feedback to tweak a few things.

Negative 3326 pFirst, why do I ask this question Because the Windows CE platform I am stuck with does not support this attribute.

When called from C the strongreturn valuestrong and the strongref UInt32 numberOfDigitsstrong value are both properly received from the C layer. Now I remove the attribute and use the Windows CE required approach of passing an unmanaged function pointer to C via PInvokep  precodeauthenticationEvent  new UnmanagedAuthenticationEventOnReceiveUnmanagedAuthenticationEvent unmanagedAuthenticationEvent  Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegateauthenticationEvent CallRegisterForAuthenticationEventuBTTransportPtr, unmanagedAuthenticationEvent codepre  pwhere CallRegisterForAuthenticationEventIntPtr, IntPtr is the PInvoke signature.p  pI have declared the following class variablesp  precodeprivate IntPtr unmanagedAuthenticationEvent private Delegate authenticationEvent private UInt32 numberOfDigits  the ref UInt32 passed back to C private UInt32 matchValue      the return value codepre  pto protect my delegate function pointer AND the variables passed back to C from garbage collection.

Negative 3326 pIm considering to perform the color space conversion from YUV422 to RGB using HLSL. A fourbyte YUYV will yield 2 threebyte RGB values, for example, Y1UY2V will give R1G1B1left pixel and R2G2B2right pixel. Given texture coordinates in pixel shader increased gradiently, how could I differentiate between the texture coordinates for the left pixels i.e. all R1G1B1 and the texture coordinates for right pixels i.e. all R2G2B2. This way I could render all R1G1B1 and all R2G2B2 on a single texture instead of two.p  pThanksp

Negative 3326 pThere are lots of distributed job queuing libraries for Python see a hrefhttpwiki.python.orgmoinParallelProcessing relnofollowhttpwiki.python.orgmoinParallelProcessinga.  All of the ones Ive looked at so far seem to share a design model where a controller node reaches out to start processes on a configured set of worker nodes, either via ssh, or via a custom daemon listening on a designated TCP port.p  pUnfortunately, the compute cluster Im using for all my worker nodes does not permit inbound  connections, and for taskspecific reasons the controller node has to be outside the cluster.  Therefore, I need the inverse model the emworkersem must connect to the emcontrollerem.  The controller being on the public Internet, the control protocol must be cryptographically secured somehow ssh would be operationally simplest, but I could work with some other sort of secure channel protocol if thats whats available, as long as it can authenticate both endpoints e.g. TLS with preshared client and server certificates.  Can anyone recommend an existing queueing library that supports this modelp  pThere is a webbased management interface which allows me to spawn tasks on a set of cluster nodes.  It cannot easily be scripted, nor can it be tricked into proxying control channels.p

And if the programs are already running I can call these startup scripts again no issue and the programs will simply output that they are already running and their pids.p  pIm trying to figure out if there is a way to do this within a java program.  strongIs there some hidden command in the HadoopZooKeeperAccumulo API where I can run Class.runconfigs and itll start or try to start HadoopZooKeeperAccumulostrongp  pMy next step is that I can probably use jsch to run ssh commands, but that seems like Im not really leaving the bash script behind.p  pEdit a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15186213executinghadoopexamplejarfilesfromjavaexecuting hadoop example jar files from javaa In this question the asker is executing the start commands using Runtime.  Is this an appropriate way to start Hadoop  Id rather use the native Hadoop API if there are commands to use there.p

Negative 3326 pI was curious what would be an efficient way for reconstructing a function by having some continuous values say I have yvalues for x between [0,10] x is an integer and the corresponding decimal yvalues are between [0,1] of it available and if it is possible to set a precision for the algorithm used to get an arbitrary approximation.p  pI came across the possibility to reconstruct such functions using Fourier series but am very uncertain on how to implement that in C on my own. The purpose is to learn by doing rather than using already available libraries. Any other suggestions on how to approximately build up a function are welcome as well. For creating functions during runtime I was thinking of metaprogramming with codeExpressioncodes.p  pstrongEditstrong For Fourier series, I found a related question plus a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma54479441785141 titleansweranswera.

Unfortunately, if you returned lots of data, SVN.EXE would hang indefinitely.

Negative 3326 pIn C, if you try to write to memory thats not yours, one possible thing that can happen is a segfault. Technically, the behavior is undefined when you try to write to memory thats not yours but one of the ways a OS can handle such a situation is by throwing a segfault.

Negative 3326 pHello I am writing an ASP.Net MVC application and I have a special class dedicated for Database connection. In my HomeController I call the static methods of this special DB class, which return the needed data into objects. I use the Entity Framework in order to achieve this.

Negative 3326 pI get the REST request as an object. When comes to our application it automatically parses the  json string to an object. Then I need to validate it. I thought to validate with the json schema. There are not more than 20 properties on that object. But unknown parameters can be come to the request.p  pIs it a problem when consider the performance what is the best way to do this using the schema validator or doing it on the application code wise by using regex. Another thing is if i am using json schema validator i need to get the error messages and throw our own messages. for that i need to use the regex again.

Negative 3326 pI have faced with very strange behavior in listview android. I puts several ViewGroupsactually RelativeLayout into a ListView as its item. The ViewGroup has TextViews and ImageViews. I registered OnClickListener on the ImageViews in the ViewGroup. When I tabbed the ImageViews, The OnClickListener is called in delayed It was over than 2 seconds.. Sometimes, the OnClickListener is  never called unless I tabbed another view in a device. In that case, the method is called multiply and in burst.p  pI think it seems to be related to focus. But I can not find a solution. This strange behavior occurs in only Galaxy S3. It works fine in Galaxy S4.p  pMeanwhile, OnTouchListener works fine even in the case in Galaxy S3. It means that a touch event arrives the View in the ViewGroup. I can not understand why the OnClickListener is called delayed or in out of focus even it receives touch events in OnTouchListeners.p  precode1227 233151.203 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233151.268 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233151.278 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233151.278 Idebug19534 myimageview touch event 1227 233153.333 DAbsListView19534 unregisterIRListener is called  1227 233153.433 DAbsListView19534 unregisterIRListener is called  1227 233153.518 Idebug19534 dofollow clicked222222222222 codepre  pIn above log, you can see 4 times touch event. But OnClickListener is call after 2 seconds from last touch event.p  pUPDATE I did reset my deviceGalaxyS3 by tabbing reset button which is shown when I pressed long a power button of my device. And I tested it again. But, It was same result.  However, Today, I powered off my device by seperation of a battery. And powered on. It works fine without any source code changes. Is there any difference between the reset by poweroff and softwarereset Anyway, It words good this time. I will report it again if the behavior occurs again next time.p  pUPDATE I figure out that this issue is happened in all android devices. I guess that it is related to drawing cache of ListView. I guess that ListView makes drawing caches for its child views in sometimes. I checked it out by enabling showing boundaries of all views in android system setting. After enabling showing boundaries, I navigates several items in ListView. Then, I saw some view of child of ListView does not have its child  layout boundary. It means that it is just image not a view. In that time, All controlsincluding ImageView does not work. After just little scrolling of the ListView, The queued click events are flushed to a child control at that time. It means that scrolling of ListView triggers changing of the cache image with the real view. I can not find a way turning off this drawing cache in ListView.p  pUPDATE I solved this issue. I feeds views created statically by myself instead of using convertView in getView method. In this case, something wrong is  happend inside of ListView. I changed it to use convertView always.p

Negative 3326 pI am building a web service Sevlets which uses SSH to fetch informations from other remote servers. For the sake of simplicity I opted to use Apache commons exec library to do the ssh instead of using SSH Client implementions in Java like JSch. This implementation works fine in my developement environment but when I deploy it to the remote web server A Red Hat Server with OpenSSH client it fails with an error message.p  blockquote   psshexchangeidentification Connection closed by remote hostp blockquote  pBut when I ssh to the web server and restart the Apache Tomcat deamon, the SSH in my servlet code works until I terminate my SSH session with the web server and then fails with above message.p  pPS I would prefer to abstain from using Java SSH client implementations as much as possible, because the ssh setup in my environment is not straight forward and it involves setting up tunnels. Such setups are already done using the ssh config file and hence I would like to use that existing setup as much as possible.p

So, the given solution is to add the IP and the hostname in the etchosts on linux. This is my etchosts on my server myserverp  precode127.0.0.1 localhost locahost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4      I saw this line on internet 192.168.1.100   myserver codepre  pBut the client can not access to myserver. This is the setup that I have on myserver computerp  precodeIP LAN of my server fixed 192.168.1.100  Hostname myserver  IP WAN  dinamyc domain name mydomain.org  codepre  pIn my router I have opened ports 3700 and 4848 and makes an IP forwarding from the WAN to the LAN IP of myserver. Also, my router update my DynDNS account whenever change my IP WAN. I would add that I have configured a NAS server on port 8080 BarracudaDrive which I access directly from the browser a hrefhttpmydomain.org relnofollowhttpmydomain.orgap  pI configured glassfish to remotely manage, and I can do it without problems from internet a hrefhttpmydomain.org4848 relnofollowhttpmydomain.org4848a Also, I modified following another solution the glassfish IIOP listener with the following settingsp  precodenetwork address 192.168.1.100 which could also put myserver listener port 3700 listener enabled codepre  pGlassfish starts successfully.p  pRemotely from a client on a windows 7 computer, I try to connect to the server as followsp  precodeprops.setPropertyContext.INITIALCONTEXTFACTORY, com.sun.enterprise.naming.SerialInitContextFactory props.setPropertyorg.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost, mydomain.org props.setPropertyorg.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialPort, 3700 .... lookup  context.lookupbeanName codepre  pcontext.lookup freezes gone unanswered for a long time until I have to kill the application manually.p  pI also tried adding clientserver configuration to the system  System.setProperty org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost, mydomain.orgp  pNothing.p  pIve also tried adding in the etchosts on windows the IP WAN xx.yyy.aaa.bbb of myserver though the WAN IP is dynamic but I wanted to try if it worked  xx.yyy.aaa.bbb myserver p  pAfter adding this, I also tried with props.setProperty org.omg.CORBA.ORBInitialHost, myserverp  pNothing.p  pIf I turn off the glassfish server, context.lookup, after about 1 minute, returns a org.omg.CORBA.COMMFAILURE Detailed 00,410,001 Connection failure SocketType IIOPCLEARTEXT hostname myserver, port 3700 ..... . etc , which is correct I guess.p  pIt does not work. If I put the url mydomain.org3700 in the chrome browser, then download a file containing GIOP and some strange characters, which tells me that domain and port are working. The wireshark software shows me that there is dialogue between my local WAN IP and the remote IP of myserver, although I do not know how to decipher the dialogue.p  pFinally, I copied the same jars of my glassfish server to the client, if any difference in versions.p  pNothing. It does not work. I already read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3849438ejbremoteapplicationclientEJB remote applicationclienta  and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8361971unabletodoaremoteejbaccessfromadifferenthostUnable to do a remote ejb access from a different hosta and .....etc.p  pPlease Help Me..p
Negative 3326 pI have a heavily VBA based workbook where I am going to be making all sheets other than a Make sure to enable macros worksheet xlVeryHidden on close. I will then add code in the codeWorkbookOpencode event to unhide them.p  pThis is to prevent all modification of any objects from happening without proper events triggering, etc.p  pHere is the code Im using note there is a mirrored on open type event to unhide themp  precodePrivate Sub WorkbookBeforeCloseCancel As Boolean      hideAllContentOnWorkbookClose  End Sub  Private Sub hideAllContentOnWorkbookClose      Application.ScreenUpdating  False     Dim sh As Worksheet     For Each sh In Worksheets note this function ensures I only do this to the right worksheets, not relevant code here         If checkIfWorksheetShouldBeHiddensh.CodeName Then sh.Visible  xlVeryHidden     Next sh     Application.ScreenUpdating  True  End Sub codepre  pHowever this presents an awkward situation. Because this event fires on the codeClosecode event, it modifies the workbook, which then triggers a Do you want to save prompt. p  pUnfortunately, if the user presses no then the workbook will close with the sheets remaining unhidden. If the workbook is then opened with macros disabled, the sheets will be unhidden. Note this problem only exists if the user saves the workbook after it is opened.p  pI am hoping for a better alternative than simply forcing a silent save in the codeBeforeClosecode method. I conceivably could also intercept the on save and on save as events too and cancel them, requiring the user to save using buttons I could add I could add Save and Close as buttons in the workbook and disable the builtin saveclose events.p  pIm not really a fan of either path. What is a better way to do thisp

Negative 3326 pRecently we have upgraded over application version in our prodution environment. Ever since the performance of our system became very slow. A Business usecase which used to complete within 1 hour in previous version is taking more than 3 hours to compelete in the current version. We analysed furthur and narrowed our problem to a single sql query. There is no change made either in the code corresposing to this query or the query itself. The number of times this query has executed in current version is almost the same as number of times the query has executed in previous version too and also we donot suspect too much change in database data as well. Our customer took statspack analysis for both version and found that this particular query is listed as the top query consuming more physical reads, more buffer gets, more elapsed time and more cpu time in current version whereas the statspack file correspoding to previous version does not even list this in even one catagory.  br So what are all the possiblities for the same query under almost same data load to result in more physical reads, more buffer gets, more elapsed time and more cpu time   p

Negative 3326 pI have a solution with some projects in that make up a library. I use this library in some of my other solutions. I do this by making a reference to the dll which is generated when the library solution is compiled. So far, so good.p  pNow Im debugging one of those other solutions. I see that Im using a function from the library I built and I want to see what the code does. I hit F12 and Im taken to a very useless page where I see only the signature. p  pI could add the library projects to my solution. this is unsatisfactory because when someone is editing the solution I want it to be clear that the messing about with the library bit is going to affect other programs.

Negative 3326 pIve been learning python and ive got a doubt and im not sure if what im thinking is the correct. As you know Python is an OOP Language and all objects have an id, type and a value. However theres a concept that im not sure if i understood well. Its the mutable and immutable objects. I know there are some objects that are mutables like arrays, lists and there are others that are immutable like strings, ints, tuples etc. Basically the main diference is that the immutable cant change its value. For example if ive got an int varp  pcodex  1codep  pits value is always the same.p  pAfter that line of code if i create another var x but now  2, its another object, because they have different ids, right But now, how can i access a var by id, for example my first x varp  pHope you can help. Thanks p

Negative 3326 pSay I have 20 classes in my root package. I decided to organize the classes by creating 3 subpackages under the root package. Then I put 5 classes into each of the subpackages, leaving 5 classes at the root package because they are top level classes. Now because I need to use classes in subpackages from the 5 classes in the root package, I end up making classes in subpackages public, while before subpackaging those classes only have within package exposure.p  pThe above code organization is done with good guidances. The subpackaging is by feature instead of by layer. The interdependency before packages are minimized. But still, a lot of subpackage classes make sense to be accessed from a level higher.p  pIs there a good practice addressing this type of scenariosp

Negative 3326 pI have a large JSON file about 90MB that contains an homogeneous array of objects. I am trying to write a Haskell program that reduces the values in the array. This seems like a good candidate for lazy evaluation  the program shouldnt have to read each object from the file until the previous object has been processed.p  pIve profiled the memory usage of the program when using the Data.Aeson and Text.JSON packages, and it seems that the entire file is being parsed and a full abstractsyntaxtree is being constructed in one pass before the array can processed by the rest of the program. Probably because the parse takes place in the Maybe or Either or Result monad, and it isnt known whether the parse will return Just or Nothing or equivalents until the complete AST has been built. This gives worryingly high memory usage, and causes space overflows in most cases.p  pDo any libraries support twopass parsing A first parse which determines whether the file CAN be parsed into the expected types, and then a second lazy parse that reads more of the file as it is neededp  pOr is there a better way of solving this problemp

Negative 3326 pSorry if this is a repeat, but this is killing me and most of the .NET 4.0 vs 4.5 articles I find degenerate into screaming contests so I figured I would ask here.p  pBasically did they make any changes to floating point arithmetic from .NET 4.0 to 4.5p  pTo expound, we have a mostly C application that stores coordinates in 3 dimensions as floats and performs some sine and cosine operations on them. I cant be too specific for business reasons and lack of access to source code. We compiled it in Visual Studio 2010 SP 1 using .NET 4.0 and developed automated unit tests for this compilation and they all passed. After installing 2012, some of the unit tests were failing based on precision of floating point variables. We are losing something like 6 digits off of our expected results according to our logs. Our current hypothesis is that the register size change from 86 bits to 64 bits has something to do with it, but the fact that the unit tests are breaking in both 2010 and 2012 leads us to believe that it has something to do with one of the hidden bug fixes in .NET 4.5. I am at the end of my rope and have been hitting my head against this problem for at least 3 days and two of my coworkers have been working it for longer.p  pThanks guys.

Negative 3326 pHi this is my first question so hope it makes sensep  pI need to compare two rows against each other from the same table  quote which have multiple columns. eg.p  precodeaagrnum aqtenum atrmres  astlamt  atrmdat  aqtests .... etc abc123  1       C        5000     20140102 Y abc123  2       C        5000     20130102 N codepre  pwhat I have so far isp  precodeSELECT  FROM  SELECT  FROM quote a   WHERE a.aagrnum  abc123   AND a.aqtenum  1 c UNION SELECT  FROM  SELECT  FROM quote b   WHERE b.aagrnum  abc123   AND b.aqtenum  2 d WHERE c.atrmres ltgt d.atrmres AND c.astlamt ltgt d.astlamt AND c.atrmdat ltgt d.atrmdat codepre  pHowever I get the message that table C is undefined. I hope to do the comparisons across multiple columns and have nothing returned if these compared columns are all equal and just the two rows if they are not equal. So in the example table above I would have two rows displayed as atrmdat is not equal in both rows, however it does not matter that aqtests is not equal across them both.p  pDoes anyone have an idea of how I may do this I will be very grateful Thanksp

Ultimately I want to mount the camera to the underside of a hovering multirotor UAV in order to calibrate the GPS accuracy.p  pThe basic method I am using isp  ol liDefine object pointsli liOpen videoli liUndistort frame based on saved camera matrix camera calibration already performedli liFind chessboard cornersli liIf corners found, refine cornersli liFind the rotation and translation vectors cv2.pnpransacli liProject 3D points to image plane cv2.projectpointsli lipConvert rotation vector to rotation matrix as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14515200pythonopencvsolvepnpyieldswrongtranslationvectorthis answerap  precodenprodrigues  np.asarrayrvecsnew[,],np.float64 rmatrix  cv2.Rodriguesnprodrigues[0] codepreli lipstrongCalculate camera pose as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16265714cameraposeestimationopencvpnpthis answerastrongp  precodecampos  np.matrixrmatrix.T  np.matrixtvecsnew codepreli lipStore valuesp  precodecamx.appendcampos.item0 camy.appendcampos.item1 camz.appendcampos.item2 codepreli ol  pstrongHoweverstrong when I run this code with a video that should be a straight line at constant altitude, the plotted x,y graph gives a curved x,y plot, and z is not constant as shown by the x,z plot a hrefhttpimgur.comQIY3wgQ,pDM5T0x,HEDJtAt1 relnofollowhttpimgur.comQIY3wgQ,pDM5T0x,HEDJtAt1ap  pstrongIs there any reason why this should not be giving a straigh line on the graph Perhaps an error with camera pose calculation in step 9strongp  hr  pThe complete code is as followsp  precode     Criteria, defining object points     import cv2     import numpy as np     import time     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      IMPORTANT Enter chess board dimensions      chw  9     chh  6      Defining draw functions for lines     def drawimg, corners, imgpts         corner  tuplecorners[0].ravel         cv2.lineimg, corner, tupleimgpts[0].ravel, 255,0,0, 5         cv2.lineimg, corner, tupleimgpts[1].ravel, 0,255,0, 5         cv2.lineimg, corner, tupleimgpts[2].ravel, 0,0,255, 5         return img       Load previously saved data     with np.loadcameracalib.npz as X         mtx, dist, , ,   [X[i] for i in mtx,dist,rvecs,tvecs,imgpts]       Criteria, defining object points     criteria  cv2.TERMCRITERIAEPS  cv2.TERMCRITERIAMAXITER, 30, 0.001     objp  np.zeroschhchw,3, np.float32     objp[,2]  np.mgrid[0chw,0chh].T.reshape1,2       Setting axis     axis  np.float32[[9,0,0], [0,6,0], [0,0,10]].reshape1,3      cap  cv2.VideoCaptureCalibrationvideochess2.MP4     count  0     fcount  0     whilecap.isOpened         ret1, img  cap.read         if ret1  False or countlim             printVideo analysis complete.             break         if count gt 0             h,  w  img.shape[2]             newcameramtx, roicv2.getOptimalNewCameraMatrixmtx,dist,w,h,1,w,h              Undistorting             img2  cv2.undistortimg, mtx, dist, None, newcameramtx              gray  cv2.cvtColorimg2,cv2.COLORBGR2GRAY             ret2, corners  cv2.findChessboardCornersgray, chw,chh,None             if ret2  True                 fcount  fcount1                  Refining corners                 cv2.cornerSubPixgray,corners,11,11,1,1,criteria                   Find the rotation and translation vectors                 rvecsnew, tvecsnew, inliers  cv2.solvePnPRansacobjp, corners, mtx, dist                   Project 3D points to image plane                 imgpts, jac  cv2.projectPointsaxis, rvecsnew, tvecsnew, mtx, dist                 drawimg2,corners,imgpts                 cv2.imshowimg,img2                 cv2.waitKey1                    Converting rotation vector to rotation matrix                 nprodrigues  np.asarrayrvecsnew[,],np.float64                 rmatrix  cv2.Rodriguesnprodrigues[0]                   Pose According to httpstackoverflow.comquestions16265714cameraposeestimationopencvpnp                 campos  np.matrixrmatrix.T  np.matrixtvecsnew                  camx.appendcampos.item0                 camy.appendcampos.item1                 camz.appendcampos.item2              else                 print Board not found          count  1         print count     cv2.destroyAllWindows     plt.plotcamx,camy     plt.show codepre
Negative 3326 pI am trying to figure out a simple code for logging in facebook from a Windows Phone 8.1 app C.p  pAs the codeFacebook Clientcode from NuGet doesnt target Windows Phone 8.1, it seems Id have to write some extra code. As I read ba hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsfacebookloginloginforwindowsphoneloginin this facebook postab, Id need to launch an Uri to invoke the Login Dialog. That much, I managed to do p  precode await Launcher.LaunchUriAsyncFacebookUri.DisplayLoginDialog codepre  pwhere DisplayLoginDialog is a static string object with the required necessary data on the request appId, productId, permissions, etc. I was redirected to the facebook app, to accept that my app requires such permissions. p  pAnd I accepted.p  pSo what now How do I get a response or something with the codeaccesstokencode I have researched a lot for this but I wasnt able to find relevant posts.p  pThe same facebook link from above, says at the section of iHandling the Login Dialogi that p  pi If someone successfully logs in, the URI association of your app will be automatically triggered, meaning they will be sent to your app, along with an access token ip  precodemsftProductIDauthorize accesstokenuseraccesstokenamp expiresinexpirationtimeoftoken codepre  pBut I am confused on how to actually use this in C.p  pHow do I get a response with the codeaccess tokencode after the login suceeded or and codeerror codecode and codeerror messagecode if it failed, like it is written in the facebook postp

However, codeODataMediaTypeFormatters.Createcode is not generic and recreating it involves too many dependencies that are internally scoped.  This workaround is a daunting task at a minimum.   It appears that the realistic limit of extensibility on codeODataMediaTypeFormattercode is confined to implementing custom serializers andor deserializers.p

Knowing this, Google Test can print pretty humanreadable reports when expectations fail, which is nice.p  pHowever, theres this little detailp  precode Note that we look for both Citerator and Cconstiterator.  The  reason is that C injects the name of a class as a member of the  class itself e.g. you can refer to class iterator as either  iterator or iteratoriterator.  If we look for Citerator  only, for example, we would mistakenly think that a class named  iterator is an STL container. codepre  pso if I understand things right, this means that p  ul licodeBoxconstiteratorcode has itself as a member class named codeconstiteratorcode, and codestditeratorcode as a memberclass named codeiteratorcode.li licodeBoxiteratorcode has itself as a member class named codeiteratorcode and codeBoxconstiteratorcode as a member class named codeconstiteratorcode.li ul  pTherefore both my iterator classes look like container classes to Google Testp  h2The questionh2  pHow do I design my iterator classes to make them not look like containersp  pThings Ive triedp  ul liDeclaring the codestditeratorcode superclass of codeconstiteratorcode as codeprivatecode. This solves the problem for codeconstiteratorcode by hiding the codeiteratorcode member class, but it still doesnt let me pass codea.begincode as a parameter to codeEXPECTNEcode unless codeacode is codeconstcode.

Negative 3326 pI work on a team which uses SVN to maintain the code for our website.  The team has been using SVN for a couple of years, but has recently overhauled SVN practices and now operates a little differently.p  pAs background informationp  ul licodetrunkcode is autodeployed to production, this means it always has to be clean.li licodedevcode is where most bugfixes, minor tweaks, minor 1 page features are worked onli lipcodexxxdevcode we have several other branches which are used for more extensive feature development, theyre all named xxxdev where xxx is the name of the feature. pli lipEvery day, sync merges are run from codetrunkcode  all other branches. This is a bit tedious but keeps our branches in sync with whats in codetrunkcode while minimizing the number of conflicts I have to resolve when we sync things up. Changes are deployed to trunk every day by different people so it is necessary to keep all the branches up to date. I use tortoise and I leave the revision range box blank so that all unmerged revisions are merged into the branches from codetrunkcode. pli ul  pRecently, something went wrong with a deployment from an older branch last year all kinds of bad things were happening in our merge history due to improperly performed merges, skipped revisions, etc. I cant figure out exactly what happened, but I can no longer sync merge from trunk into our branches. It attempts to remerge some older revisions which have already been merged, and fails to do so and gives me all kinds of errors if I try to push through it. Prior to this incident, weve had numerous issues with these older revisions breaking things in the merging process, and weve proceeded by deleting branches and recreating them from trunk. However, this might preserve merge history, and Im worried that we need to lose our merge history altogether to get away from these problems.p  pGiven the above information, I think our best course of action would be to drop all merge history altogether, use a fresh copy of the code from codetrunkcode, recreate all our branches by copying that fresh codetrunkcode, and proceed as we have been, but without any of the bad merge history from before we started doing daily syncs. p  pstrongMy questionstrong To do what Ive described, should we just do a recursive delete of the svnmergeinfo property on the entire codetrunkcode directory Would that cause any problems I believe since codetrunkcode is underneath the repositorys root directory, we would still be able to look at the old merge history if for some reason we needed to. p  pIf I am wrong or there is something wrong with our SVN policies, please tell me as well.p  pThank youp  hr  pEdit  I should have mentioned that the conflict Im seeing happens to be on the codesvnmergeinfocode property itself... So theres a bad merge that was modifying codesvnmergeinfocode I dont know how or why anyone on the team would have accidentally deleted the codesvnmergeinfocode property for this directory, but the change that seems to be causing all the problems this time is a deleted codesvnmergeinfocode property. p  pThis deleted codesvnmergeinfocode is on a subdirectory, not the root directory of the branch. p

Negative 3326 pJust hoping people can help me understand properly how the RepaintManager works when trying to create animations. Basically I am creating a program that draws and updates creaturesimages to a JFrame. Each creature object contains all the information for paint to be able to draw it such as x,y coordinates and an BufferedImage. Currently every time a creature object moves it calls repaint, which as you will see below in my paintpaintComponent not sure which is is best method will run a loop through all existing creatures and update their position amp graphics on the screen.p  pSo my query, is this the best way to do this as I am concerned that the RepaintManager is redrawing everything on the screen, which is not very efficient. I have a read a few postsarticles about clipping or overriding update methods but just cant quite get my head around them  so is it possible to every time repaint is called it only updates objectscreatures that have changedp  pSome code of what I am talking aboutp  precodepublic void paintComponent Graphics g         super.paintComponentg        setDoubleBufferedtrue Probably not needed        Graphics2D g2d  Graphics2D g         Draws the land area for penguins.        g2d.setColornew Color121,133,60        g2d.fill3DRectland.x, land.y, land.width, land.height, true        OR g2d.fillland        g2d.setColorColor.BLUE        g2d.fillsea         drawCreaturesg2d                    codepre  pAll graphics in the paint method wont change and shouldnt need to be repainted, however the method below will...p  precode   private void drawCreaturesGraphics2D g2d      try          for Creature c  crlist              g2d.drawImagec.createImagetxs,tys, c.getPos1.width, c.getPos1.height, this             g2d.drawImagecImg,c.getPos1.width,c.getPos1.height,this              if c instanceof Fish ampamp c.getMating.equalsMating.WBABY                  int xos0                 for Creature fb  c.getChildren                      if fb.getMating.equalsMating.BABY g2d.drawImagefb.createImagetxs,tys,c.getPos1.widthxos,c.getPos1.height50,txs2,tys2,this                     xos25                                            if c.getInfotrue displayInfog2d,c This changes when a creature is clicked on.             else if c.getStateState.NORMAL  c.getMating.equalsMating.LOVE drawStateg2d,c updated through a creatures movesearch methods.                catchConcurrentModificationException cme  System.out.printlnCME ERROR  codepre  pp  pThe important part is the first line of the enhanced for loop as this draws images to the JFrame window.

Negative 3326 pThis may have been asked a few different ways, but this is a relatively new field to me so forgive me if it is redundant and point me on my way.p  pEssentially I have created a data collection engine that take high speed data up to thousands of points a second and stores them in a database.p  pThe database is dynamic, so the statements being fed to the database are dynamically created in code as well, this in turn required a great deal of string manipulation. All of the strings however are declared within scope of asynchronous event handler methods, so they should fall out of scope as soon as the method completes.p  pAs this application runs, its memory usage according to task manager  process explorer, slowly but steadily increases, so it would seem that something was not getting properly disposed and or collected.p  pIf I attach CDB p  yes I am loading the sos.dll from the CLR and do a dumpheap I see that the majority of this is being used by System.String, as well if I dumpheap type System.String, and the do the addresses I see the exact strings the SQL statements.p  phowever if I do a gcroot on the any of the addresses, I get Found 0 unique roots run GCRoot all to see all roots. that in turn if I try as it suggests I get Invalid argument all O.op  pSo after some googling, and some arguments concerning that unrooted objects will eventually be collected by GC, that this is not an issue.. I looked to see, and it appears 84 of my problem is sitting on the LOH where depending on which thread you look at where, may or may not get processed for GC emunlessem there is a memory constraint on the machine or I explicitly tell it to collect which is considered bad according to everything I can findp  pSo what I need to know is, is this essentially true, that this is not a memory leak, it is simply the system leaving stuff there until it HAS to be reclaimed, and if so how then do I tell that I do or do not have a legitimate memory leak.p  pThis is my first time working the debugger external to the application as I have never had to address this sort of issue before, so I am very new to that portion, this is a learning experience.p  pApplication is written in VS2012 Pro, C, it is multithreaded, and a console application is wrapping the API for testing, but will eventually be a Windows service.p

Negative 3326 pOk, so my question is very specific. Im attempting to randomly generate a game stage for a 2D platformer Im making. I want the platforms to be a set distance apart and I want the number of platforms created to be configureable. I believe the best way to do this is with a while loop that has an if statement nested in it, Ive attempted it but cant get it working. Heres what Ive tried.p  precodevar numLedges  10 var lastLedge var xSpace  randomIntFromInterval0, 600 var ySpace  randomIntFromInterval0, 400 var currentLedgeX  xSpace var currentLedgeY  ySpace var lastLedgeX  1000 var lastLedgeY  1000 var i  0 var loopCount  0 var maxLoops  100  function randomIntFromIntervalmin,max      return Math.floorMath.randommaxmin1min   function createLedges          do     This is supposed to make sure the platforms are being created 100px away in any direction                 if currentLedgeX gt lastLedgeX  100  currentLedgeX lt     lastLedgeX  100 ampamp currentLedgeY gt lastLedgeY  100  currentLedgeY lt     lastLedgeY  100   Creates a ledge using phaser that is roughly 40 x 40px                     var currentLedge  stillLedge.createcurrentLedgeX,     currentLedgeY, platform                     currentLedge.body.immovable  true                     lastLedgeX  currentLedgeX                     lastLedgeY  currentLedgeY                     i                              loopCount          while i  numLedges  loopCount lt maxLoops  codepre  pThis doesnt appear to loop or it turns into an infinite loop somewhat randomly. If someone can think of a better way of doing this or a way to make this work Id appreciate it.

Negative 3326 pIm currently learning Assembly, Im not very new but maybe since 1  2 months back. I am using 32bit Assembly, NASM to assemble it into a .o file  and MinGWgcc to compile to a .exe file. but It takes so much time to type nasm f elf  in the nasm directory and then do gcc  o  all the time. so I wanted to create a quick program where I just start it. and all that gets executed.p  pSo I want the program to 1st start the nasm assembler. then wait till its done like when you call another function, and after that, I want to start the gcc compiler, and wait till that is done. I know its quite easy to make in batch files, but I still want to learn how to do it in assembly, incase I need to do it someday. So the question is, how do I start a program with startconsole parameters, and then also wait for it to exit.p  pThanksp

Negative 3326 pThis question is inspired by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30030925whymoveswapimplinboostswaptoaseparatenamespacethis onea. Consider the codep  precodenamespace ns    template lttypename Tgt   void swapTamp a, Tamp b      using namespace std     swapa, b     codepre  pAfter some test with GCC, I found that codeswapa, bcode resolves tobr 1 codestdswapcode if codeTcode has overloaded codestdswapcode e.g., standard container typesbr 2 codensswapcode otherwise, leading to infinite recursion.br So, it seems that the compiler will first try to find a match in the namespace codenscode.

Negative 3326 pIm trying to parse large CSV files large here means the CSV files are frequently larger than main memory. I process the CSV rowbyrow as a stream, which allows me to deal with those large files. p  pa hrefhttpswww.ietf.orgrfcrfc4180.txt relnofollowThe RFC on CSV filesa defines the double quote character to regard all that comes after as a single fiels thus escaping delimitersp  blockquote   ol start6   lipFields containing line breaks CRLF, double quotes, and commas      should be enclosed in doublequotes.  For examplep      paaa,b CRLF      bb,ccc CRLF      zzz,yyy,xxxpli   ol blockquote  pEvery now and then, my application needs to deal with improper CSV files, which contain a double quote character that is not closed. This results in the CSV parser trying to read the whole part of the file starting from this double quote charater into one file, which, as my files can be large, might cause memory issues. p  pWhat I want to do is to make my parsing solution robust to such cases by somehow detect such problems and abort parsing in these cases. One thing that might help is that I know the typical length of my fields, so I might be able to do something with an upper bound on the field length.p  pDoes anyone know a way to parse CSV files in a way that is robust to large files that can contain unclosed occurrences of double quote characters, such that it parses the file when possible and aborts withouth consuming all available memory first when an unclosed double quote is present My current parsing solution makes use of OpenCSV, but I would have no problem with switching if this would help solving it.p

Negative 3326 pIm helping to implement an experiment using PsychoPy on a Windows 8 tablet. It doesnt seem to be possible to get direct access to touch events through either PsychoPy, or the pyglet or PyGame interfaces.p  pMost other sources Ive found have referred to using mouse move events in place of touch events. This works fine for recording position, but for recording time it doesnt work for us. We would like to collect the timing of the start of the touch, whereas the mouse event comes at the end of the touch.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to do this, either in PsychoPy or by importing another library into the experimentp  pstrongUpdatestrong Logging ioHub mouse events, it looks like press and release mouse events are both sent at the end of the touch. This makes sense as this is the point at which the OS is sure that the touch is not a swipe. Also, it will decide whether the touch is a left or rightclick depending on the duration of the touch.p

Negative 3326 pI need to move a large mongodb database arround 400 gb from one server to another. Both servers are in the same data center and I decided to use db.copyDatabase for that. Because of the db size, this will run several hours. When I begin a copy inside mongo shell, the prompt does not return until the copy is finished. Is there a way to run that command asynchron. I want to close the ssh session to the destination server and therfor need the shell to not stop the copy when I exit it.p  pthanks in advance, Danielp

Negative 3326 pSo I am attempting to send a web request via the maker channel on If This then That to a Arduino and Ethernet shield to turn on a led. From what I understand, I would send a POST request to the boards url and it would set the led state to high. However I am fairly new to this kind of stuff and I really do not know where to go from there. What sort of text would I put in the  Maker Channel body  I do know that its JSON. Also more importantly how would I configure the Arduino and web server to receive the POST request p

Negative 3326 pIm trying to create a hashtable of filesystem watchers. This is to keep a running record of active filesystemwatchers with the directories they are watching as keys. Then via a form the user can add and delete folders to watch, which are visible in a listview or something.p  pMy main problem is how to keep the hash table between methods and classes. Im a bit of a novice to C and it doesnt seem to work the way Im used to in VB.NET.p  pSo I have stripped down to simplifyp  precode    public partial class MainForm  Form              public static Hashtable globalHashTable         public MainForm                      InitializeComponent                    public void Button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                      FileSystemWatcher watcher1  new FileSystemWatcherC             globalHashTable.AddC,watcher1                codepre  pSo that a filesystemwatcher is added to the hashtable. However since the globalhashtable is static  this wont work. Making it non static means I have to create an instance of it when the buttton is pressed, so I have a new one each time as its not kept. My problem is how to keep a table in memory between methods and classes.p  pIm fairly sure Ive majorly misunderstood something as Im new to all of this. Also I doubt this is even a half decent way to do this, if anyone has a better way, then please go aheadp  pThanks,p  pMattp

Negative 3326 pIm attempting to code a live chat based off jQuery and PHP, where when the user sends a message their chat is automatically scrolled to the bottom to show the latest message.p  pWhen a message is sent or received, I use jQuerys append function to add a new div to the containing element, which contains every chat message in a separate div.p  pInitially, this works. When I send a message, the chat is scrolled to the bottom of the element otherwise it would need to be scrolled down manually. After quite a few messages, however, it begins scrolling to the middleupper section of the chat, rather than the bottom.p  pThis is the jQuery that scrolls the chat downp  precode.livechatboxbody.scrollTop.livechatboxbody[0].scrollHeight codepre  pThis is the HTML code of the element containing the chatp  precodeltdiv classlivechatboxbodygt     ltdiv classlivechattopgtltdivgt     ltdiv classchatmessagecontainer chatmessagecontainerselfgt         ltdiv classchatmessage chatmessageselfgt             ltspangt Message 1 ltspangt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe thirdnested div, emchatmessagecontainerem, is repeated for each message sent.p  pThis is the CSS for the emlivechatboxbodyem elementp  precodefloat left width 100 maxheight 245px height 245px padding 7px boxsizing borderbox backgroundcolor fafafa border 1px solid d7d7d7 bordertop none borderradius 1px 1px 0 0 overflowy auto position relative codepre  pMy theory is that, once the chat reaches a certain height, it begins to use the maximum height in the CSS rather than the actual height of the element, meaning it would only take you to the bottom of the maximum height  rather than the whole height. Though, this happens AFTER the user is allowed to scroll, suggesting that its already exceeded the maximum height allowed before overflowing.p  pIf anybody knows why this is happening, Im fascinated to know.p

The problem is that at this part of codep  precodeparentandroidTextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Inverse codepre  pthe Inverse is not found, and in another row it doesnt find Colored. I read at some pages that a problem could be that the program doesnt find java so i set the system environment variable, but this doesnt work.There were some other solutions but dont understood all

Negative 3326 pSo I am trying to build up a small app that uses htmlknockoutweb api.p  pI dont want to use Durandal or another navigation framework like that if I can do it without.p  pI currently have three separate html pages all of which access via a common datacontext protected data methods that require authentication.  If the datacontext receives a 401 error after accessing the Web Api, I want to pop up a bootstrap modal with login functionality so the user can authenticate themselves and carry on where they left off.p  pI have sort of achieved this by cheating and using asp.net web forms with a login user control that contains the login functionality. This user control is included in the three separate pages. However Im now getting bogged down with complexities involving script loading order and dependencies so Id like to bring this all back to a simpler basis using plain html if possible.p  pWhat I want to avoid is having to have the html code for the bootstrap modal being duplicated in every single HTML page as this would be massively inefficient, but I dont see how I can achieve the functionality I want without doing just that at the moment.p  pIs this possible to do or do I need to go even further back and make this a single page application and inject viewmodels as needed  The last option takes me closer to or to a Durandalstyle app which Im trying to avoid if possible.p

Negative 3326 pI have to create a method that takes two integers, let them be codencode and codemcode, and returns how many ways there are to sum codemcode positive numbers to get codencode.  For example, a method call like this codepartition6, 2code should return 3 because there are 3 ways possible. They are code5  1code, code4  2code, and code3  3code. By the way, code4  2code is the same as code2  4code, so the method should not count them as two distinct variations.  Does anybody know a solution to the problemp  pUpdated codencode and codemcode are not greater than 150.p
