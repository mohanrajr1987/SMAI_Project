Positive 72270 pIm trying to get a couple of elastic responsive links in a Bootstrap navbar fixed navbar, and cant seem to get it to work. I dont need the whole navbar to be responsive and collapse automatically as I am implementing my own custom collapse behaviour below a certain screen width, but I just need a couple of the link areas on the bar to expand or shrink according to the window width, while the other buttons on the navbar remain the same size. I have forced the link area widths with nbsps in the code below to make them temporarily look the right width on my screenp  pAttempting to use various standard Bootstrap classes e.g. justified buttons or justified navbar to achieve this has either produced links that are the full width of the navbar, thus pushing all other content onto other lines, or where the link areas remain the width of their actual text content, rather than expanding to fill the available space.p  pI need the navbar brand logo on the far left, and on the far right I have several buttons including drop down menus that need to remain on the right. The space inbetween I want filled with 2 elasticresponsive link areas that change in size according to the window width.p  pCode is below. Feels like I am overcomplicating things but not sure howwhere as need to keep my buttons on the right that are vertically centred...p  pMany thanks for any help or suggestionsp  precodeltdiv classnavbar navbarinverse navbarfixedtopgt    ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt       ltdiv classnavbarheader stylemargintop5pxgt          lta classnavbarbrand styleheight30px paddingtop5px paddingbottom5px hrefgtltimg srcimglogo.pnggtltagt       ltdivgt     ltdiv styleheight 1pxgt lt inner div gt       ltform classnavbarform navbarright forminlinegt          lta hrefgt ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp My Link Text ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp          ltagt          lta hrefgt ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp My Other Link Text ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp          ltagt           lta classbtn btnxs btnsuccessgtButton 1ltagtampnbspampnbsp           ltdiv classbtngroupgt             ltbutton typebutton classbtn btnxs btnprimary dropdowntoggle datatoggledropdown ariaexpandedfalsegtDrop down 1                 ltbuttongt                 ltul classdropdownmenu rolemenugt                     ltligtlta hrefgtMenu item 1ltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefgtMenu Item 2ltagtltligt                 ltulgt             ltdivgtampnbspampnbsp              ltul classnav navbarnav navbarrightgt                 ltligtlta hrefgtButton with another styleltagtltligt                 ltligt                     ltdiv classdropdowngtampnbspampnbsp                         lta href datatarget datatoggledropdown ariahaspopuptrue rolebutton ariaexpandedfalsegt2nd dropdownltagt                         ltul classdropdownmenu dropdownmenuright rolemenugt                             ltligtlta hrefgtMenu item 1ltagtltligt                             ltligtlta href idsaveonlinegtMenu item 2ltagtltligt                                                     ltulgt                     ltdivgt                 ltligt             ltulgt         ltformgt     ltdivgt lt inner div gt   ltdivgt lt containerfluid gt ltdivgt lt Top div gt codepre

Positive 72270 pIm currently building my first website using the bootstrap framework and  would like to apply 30px of padding between the lead paragraph and the responsive image for the following Blog page Im writing. However the CSS doesnt seem to apply either padding or margin to the lead class p element. It was working okay yesterday but Ive been fiddling with the layout since then, so Im not sure why this rule isnt firing now p  pSimilarly, I wrapped continue reading... in a floatright class yesterday which worked correctly, however again today since fiddling with the CSS it has defaulted to the left side of the column so that I have had to apply textalign right in CSS. What is causing these anomalies I am very new to Bootstrap and website building in general and realize that my code may be disorganized or missing crucial information, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Positive 72270 pBootstrap 3.  I am adding an image Logo and want it responsive. So the natural state is 100 width. I want it to stay the same relative size to the Text next to it in different browser widths. Is this possible or do you have to adjust size with more breakpoints In other words say from lg to md I can get the right size and position but if the monitor they have is over the breakpoint at 1200px like 1400px the image or logo ends up way to large but the text flows right in the row next to it and in tablet size the med width I can get it set right for the breakpoint but if someone has a 50px smaller size screen than an iPad then it will look to big.

A follow up to this would be how to present the data if we dont find an exact match or find multiple exact matches... two cities with the same street name in different counties, for example.p  pWe have a ton of data available in the mapping data mapinfo tab format mostly.  So we can do quick scans of street names, cities, states, etc. But Im not sure about the best way to go about approaching this problem.  Sure, using Google Maps would be nice, bue most of our clients are in closed in networks where outside access is not usually allowed and most arent willing to rely on google maps since it doesnt contain as much information as they need, such as custom map layers.   They could, obviously, go to google and get the proper location then move to our software, but this would time consuming and speed of the process can be quite important.p

Negative 72270 pI want to create a temporary cache lookup to speed up a file lookup on my webserver.p  pWhat I have now is a folder full of images, and if a user requests an image I use a File.Exists... to check to see if the image exists.  If it doesnt, download it from another server, and either way, redirect the user to it.p  pThe problem with this is that a lot of requests at once cause File.Exists to hang. I would like to keep a quick and dirty HashSet of filenames known to be in the local folder, so that if the the user requests a file, and it exists in the HashSet, just redirect to it without doing the File.Exists, if it doesnt exist int he HashSet, do the File.Exists then add it.p  pI know that the HashSet would get blown away if the server ever gets restarted, but Im not worried about that, because it would quickly rebuild itself with the most requested images using the above scenario.p  pThe main question is, since this object would be getting called from multiple users, and various requests would all be adding items to the set, would this cause a problem  Up to now all Ive used in the static global sense on webservers is DB connection strings or an email address to send alerts to, etc.p  pstrongEdit with regards to race conditionsstrong brYes I was thinking of race conditions.  But is a race condition even possible on a single HashSet  Since it only allows unique values, wouldnt the second attempt to add a value fail  At which point I would just ignore the error and continue on.p

Negative 72270 pIm trying to understand the best options for pulling off a wizard form in ruby on rails. Ideally Id like to have it so the application signup has a back and next button that allows the user to submit data in steps.p  pSo in step 1 they could fill out contact info. Once they are done they could click next and be on step 2 to fill out payment info, etc. If they make a mistake, they can click back and correct it. Some steps will be required, while others will not, but you do have to make it to the last step to submit the data to the database to sign up. They then need the ability to go back and fill out the past steps in the same fashion after completion. example perhaps if they clicked on a profile link they could recomplete the steps in the same fashion because they didnt want to complete all the steps right away. Maybe by being given a skip button before they completed the steps to sign up. I also need validation to happen on what steps have been completed preventing them from moving onto the next step until corrected or completed.p  pOption 1 Ive noticed that ajax has been recommended as an option in other questions on stackoverflow. The only problem I have with it is that the user would not be able to sign up if javascript was disabled. Ideally Id like to have it be native to ruby on rails but Im willing to work with whatever is necessary to get it to work.p

Negative 72270 pI need to come up with a file format for new application I am writing. This file will need to hold a bunch other text files which are mostly text but can be other formats as well. Naturally, a compressed tar file seems to fit the bill. The problem is that I want to be able to retrieve some data from the file very quickly and getting just a particular file from a tar.gz file seems to take longer than it should.  I am assumeing that this is because it has to decompress the entire file even though I just want one.  When I have just a regular uncompressed tar file I can get that data real quick. Lets say the file I need quickly is called data.datp  pFor example the command...p  precodetar x data.dat zf myfile.tar.gz codepre  p... is what takes a lot longer than Id like.p  pMP3 files have id3 data and jpeg files have exif data that can be read in quickly without opening the entire file. I would like my data.dat file to be available in a similar way.p  pI was thinking that I could leave it uncompressed and seperate from the rest of the files in myfile.tar.gz I could then create a tar file of data.dat and myfile.tar.gz and then hopefully that data would be able to be retrieved faster because it is at the head of outer tar file and is uncompressed.p  pDoes this sound right... putting a compressed tar inside of a tar filep  pBasically, my need is to have an archive type of file with quick access to one particular file. Tar does this just fine, but Id also like to have that data compressed and as soon as I do that, I no longer have quick access. Are there other archive formats that will give me that quick access I needp  pAs a side note, this application will be written in Python.  If the solution calls for a reinvention of the wheel with my own binary format I am familiar with C and would have no problem writing the Python module in C.  Idealy Id just use tar, dd, cat, gzip, etc though.p  pThanks, Ericp

For example, if user has selected an object of type Company, we want to load a company.xml layout, inflate it and then associate various properties company name, company slogan, city, address, revenue to tagged views.

Negative 72270 pIve used class methods and even written them following along with books. Ive heard of them described as factory methods. I understand that they operate on a class itself, rather than an instance of a class. Ive also read up on them but I still dont feel like I really understand them.p  pCan you offer any good metaphors or key distinctions that would help myself and others understand class methodsp  pPart of my problem seems to be the dynamic between when you are operating on a class vs an instance of a class. That remains a slippery issue as well which seems very relevant in this discussion.p  pCould someone try and relate class methods to a real world metaphor p  pIve explained resistance to my friends with no science background like this.

Lets close the valve 80 of the way so much less water can flow through. The valve is like a resistor in a electric circuit and the water is like the electricity and the pipe is the wire. To increase the resistance of the resistor is like progressively closing the valve in the pipe of flowing water.p  pIs there a way to draw a metaphor between a car factory, a peanut butter sandwich or something similarly tangiblep  pThanks for the help.p  pAp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combyPWw.jpg altalt textp

Negative 72270 pSomething I am struggling with, more philosophically I suppose, is whether DropDownList items or really any kind of selection list items should be part of the model, or if they should be hard coded into the UI or businesslayer.  Or perhaps this is a good use of the ViewModelp  pFor some kinds of dropdownlists, you obviously have to make them part of the model.  For instance, a dropdownlist of order ids associated with a customer will have to be generated by the model.p  pOther kinds, which I would refer to as lookup data are less clear to me.  Gender, for instance.  Why force a round trip lookup to populate a field with 2 items  Perhaps this is premature optimization, but if you have 50 fields, thats a lot of round trips just to populate one page.  Certainly, cacheing might come in handy there, but it seems kludgy.p  pI also worry that adding all these lookup lists to the model will unnecessarily clutter it.  Especially if you have a lot of them.p  pThere is also the option of not hard coding in the UI, but hard coding in the business layer.  Possibly even making a class that does nothing but populate this data.p  pIf the answer is, you should still make them part of the data model, then there is the problem of whether your datamodel should have a different table for each set of lookup fields.  If your data model has 200 or 300 such fields, thats 200 or 300 tables, and that really makes maintaining your data model more complex.  p  pI asked a question about having a common lookup table a while back, and the consensus was that this was a bad idea.  But for very data heavy applications where there are a lot of fields, i find myself doubtful.p  pNow, I know many of you will say It depends, but im looking at a in general kind of answer.  In general, what is the rule of thumb herep

If it makes any difference, my goal is to be able to serialize an arbitrary named property or member of a class.p

What is the fastest way I can change Black to Grey.p  pemI thought of two approachesemp  ol lipStart checking every single pixel in the image. As soon as a black pixel is found change it to grey. Continue till end of image. Slower but easierpli lipStart checking pixels. When a black pixel is found maintain a counter to track it. Continue incrementing the counter till the next white pixel. Then goto the counter and use a fast function like memset to change a group of black pixels to grey. Not sure but I think this may be fasterpli ol  pI have a huge 1GB image therefore approach 1 is pretty slow. Is there a betterfaster way to changeedit pixelsp

Negative 72270 pThis is probably one of the weirdest things Ive seen... I have a list of elements and each contains an icon image and a hidden popup box. When the user hovers over the icon, the popup box is display above jQuerys hover. This works fine in all browsers and IE89, but IE7 has an issue. Theres a gap between the icon and the popup box. If I set a background color and the popup boxs container is touching the row of icons, I can keep the popup box displayed on the screen as the user moves their mouse through it to make a selection. p  pHowever, I dont want a background color displayed, and when its not, the popup box will disappear when the user moves their mouse anywhere in that gap. In other words, the popup displays in the correct position, but the user cant make a selection because theres no way to get to the popup without hovering over the gap. p  pHeres some HTML and CSSp  precodeltdiv classiconnavgt    ltulgt       ltligt         ltdiv classpopupwrappergt             lta href classreplace air relairgtAir Qualityltagt             ltdiv classpopupcontainergt                 ltdiv classpopupcontentgtltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltligt       ltligt          ltdiv classpopupwrappergt             lta href classreplace health relhealthgtPublic Healthltagt             ltdiv classpopupcontainergt                 ltdiv classpopupcontentgtltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltligt       Etc....    ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precode.iconnav  position absolute top 388px zindex 999 width 100   Positioned relative to a wrapper element.  .iconnav ul  display block width 968px margin 0 auto position relative  .iconnav ul li  float left   .iconnav ul li .popupwrapper  .iconnav ul li .popupcontainer  position absolute bottom 0px paddingbottom 35px zindex 9999 width 100 displaynone left 0px  .iconnav ul li .popupcontent  width 900px height 260px backgroundcolor fff margin 0 auto padding30px  .iconnav ul li a  width121px height 115px overflow hidden  codepre  pjQueryp  precode.iconnav li .popupwrapper.hover       function          a,this.addClasshover          var name  a, this.attrrel          var popup  .popupcontainer, this          popup.cssdisplayblock           More Code...       ,function         a,this.removeClasshover         .popupcontainer, this.cssdisplaynone            codepre  pTIAp

Negative 72270 pI am currently working on a Java EJB project being deployed to Weblogic 10.3.3.  We are using JPA 1.0 with Hibernate 3.4 as the implementor.

Negative 72270 pheres the situation.p  pIn a Java Web App i was assigned to mantain, ive been asked to improve the general response time for the stress tests during QA. This web app doesnt use a database, since it was supposed to be light and simple. And i cant change that decisionp  pTo persist configuration, ive found that everytime you make a change to it, a general object containing lists of config objects is serialized to a file. p  pUsing Jmeter ive found that in the given test case, there are 2 requests taking up the most of the time. Both these requests add or change some configuration objects. Since the access to the file must be sinchronized, when many users are changing config, the file must be fully written several times in a few seconds, and requests are waiting for the file writing to happen.p  pI have thought that all these serializations are not necessary at all, since we are rewriting the most of the objects again and again, the changes in every request are to one single object, but the file is written as a whole every time. p  pSo, is there a way to reduce the number of real file writes but still guarantee that all changes are eventually serializedp  pAny suggestions appreciatedp

Negative 72270 pAm looking for some advice on the design of an application. As Iv signed an NDA I cant reveal too much about the actual business but will try to explain the requirement.p  pEssentially, we want to develop an application that will take a decision based on a customers credit profile. We will take data from a suitable provider eg. Experian and match it against the business rules. If the customer meets those rules, they get a green flag to be passed to the next process and possibly another system, but am not worried about that for now if not, they will get a red flag and not get passed on.p  pThe client has indicated that they would like the business rules to be modifiable i.e. something that they can amend and thats not hard coded or stuck in the code somewhere. They have defined a set of rules as a template. The system will only have one active template at a time, but over its lifetime might have many templates.p  pThese rules would be composed of multiple operators checking different data types. Each phasestep of the rules would be allocated a certain weight. An example of a template would be p  ul liIs the customer male  10 points li lipIs the customer female  20 pointspli lipIs the customer between 25 and 35 years of age  20 points pli lipIs the customer less than 25 years of age  10 pointspli lipDoes the customer earn between 30000 and 50000 per annum  20 pointspli ul  pSo as you can see, there are comparisonsoperators of various types boolean, integer etc.p  pI am looking for a frameworkadvice on which I can build these templates. This is a web job, so we know that well definitely be using a DB of some sort. The technology has not yet been decided, but would probably be between PHP amp .NET. We think at this stage that a lot of this will be done in SQL and would like to see if this is a good idea to pursuep  pAre there any sample applications out there that I could go through Has anyone done work of this nature beforep  pThanksp

Negative 72270 pI am creating a report application which queries a database and calculates the sales figures for staff. The result from the query is stored in a dataset. At the moment, I am dragging the chart control from the toolbox onto the page to create a control. This chart control sits in a div tag called slideshow as Im using jQuery to create a slideshow. Each chart is bound to a row from the dataset. p  pHowever, the issue I am having now is that if a new staff is added, I will have to keep messing around with the web page to display a chart for the new staff. Is there a way in which I can say, For each row in the dataset, create a chart control in the slideshow div tag p

First of all it is not a different point each time it fails, it is failing at a particular revision each time.  And I have checked the subversion logs at that revision and I have found that I mistakenly create a tag in branchestags rather than in tags.  This was fixed immediately, but it seems to be causing problems in gitsvn.p  pAny ideas what I can do to get around thisp
Negative 72270 piam working on a little javascript library, that uses the lovely jquerytmpl engine. I would like to avoid forcing the user to paste the necessary templates into hisher html or to be confronted with the template code at all for that matter.br So my question is Is there a way to hide my template code, preferably in my js file, as I understand, the scripttags are necessary if only in order to be able to select it with jquery.br The only thing I found so far is putting the templates in external file like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4315679usingexternalcompositejquerytemplatesherea but it is not really what i want.br thanksp

Negative 72270 pIm looking to see if anyone has experience with this. Im a developer first and a designer second, so this is really not my strongest suit.p  pI have a project Im working on where the goal is to get image and text sidebyside in landscape mode on the iPhone. Id like to be able to zoom in on the image using a pinch like normal, but strongnotstrong zoom in on the text as well while that is happening. I dont know if this is even possible or what kind of hacks it would take to get it working.p  pIf someone thinks this is bad in general from a UI perspective, I am open to suggestions.p  pI have considered keeping two copies of the image low and high res and then swapping them out inside of div with an codeoverflow scrollcode so users can get a zoomed version and then scroll around. It doesnt give you the full effect of zooming, but it might accomplish a similar goal. I dont know if this would work either.p  pIf anyone has suggestions or experience on the subject, please chime in. Thank youp

Negative 72270 pI am using Three20s WebController in my project and I am having issues with the back arrow on the bottom controls the lt button.p  pWhen I load a page and click a link in the WebController youd expect the back button to enable and if touched bring you back to the original page.p  pBut when I hit a link from the original page the back button is not always working, it stays disabled therefore you cannot go back to the original page.  p  pIt does sometimes work, but it seems random and its rare it does. I looked in the source for three20s WebController and all its doing is using a UIWebViews goBack function. But as I said it does work sometimes, but not most of the time.p  pI have searched the net but found no other reports of this issues, does anyone have any suggestions p  pThanksp
Negative 72270 pI am just wondering if anyone have some info or feedback about the situation I am in.

Negative 72270 pI am having trouble nailing down the best method for passing data from a Java backingmanaged bean to a jQueryJavascript component such as Highcharts, so that my web app producesdisplays  data in a dynamic, real time way. I am pretty solid on my Java side of things but I have a pretty limited knowledge of JavaScriptjQuery which is obviously where I am falling down. So far as I have read, the best way is to Ajaxify a hidden field on my web app and pass a JSON object or string in to it and then pass that value into my JS component. p  pFirstly this seems a bit labour intensive as I would have an Ajax call to update the JSON data and then a setInterval call to reread the data into the JS component I was hoping that I could pass the data straight into the JS component...p  pEither way could someone just firm up my knowledge and tell me a good tried and tested method, if different from above...

Negative 72270 pI have a custom android view that extends Button and acts as a multilevel spinner  when it is pressed it displays a series of spinnerlike dialogs that allow a user to refine their selection.

When the dialog is not active, a text description of the current selection is shown on the button.p  pI want to visually indicate that the user can change the selection by pressing the button, and think that the look of a spinner is exactly what I need for it. I want the look to be the same as other spinners on the device, and be able to easily change the text on the button, but Im not sure how to achieve that without it being kludgy. How should I go about displaying a button as a spinnerlike icon that is consistent with other spinners on the devicep

Negative 72270 pI have an NSString that I would like to search numerically.  It seems that NSNumericSearch would be the appropriate solution, but apparently only compare, caseInsensitiveCompare, localizedCompare and localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare work as sort selectors when doing a fetch in iOS. Its a core data project.  It is my understanding that this has something to do with the SQLite backing data store.p  pI have tried casting the string to an NSNumber.  There is an error with ARC, as NSNumber is basically an int.p  pIn summary, I would like to sort a string numerically 1, 2, 11, 25 as opposed to 1, 11, 2, 25.

Negative 72270 pIm in the process of planning out the infrastructure for a Mac App, and we have a startup screen with many user files listed. We want the App to be iCloudcompatible thus the need for Documentbased keyvalue wont cut it since they arent nested  correct me if Im wrong here. Essentially, we dont want to have the user keep track of each individual file themselves as that would be irritating, but rather store it in the Apps folder until the user needs it i.e. Email, Export, etc. It would eliminate a lot of the friction in the app, we think. I guess my question isp  ul liIs it possible to store files automatically in the Apps installation folder or somewhere locally without bothering the user  in a Documentbased app  and still be App Store compatible Seems like the ideal solution  user opens app, App knows its save location and automatically saves documents there when a user creates one, and pulls them to share if needed.

Negative 72270 pMy team is diving headfirst into a new project and we are taking the opportunity to bring ourselves up to date with Scrum methodology, new technology etc. Part of this involves trying to automate our QA process, using both Microsoft Test Manager and VS2010 Coded UI tests.p  pHowever, we are having problems getting the automated test playback to work with our currentlyselected WPF control library, the DevExpress XPF suite. Weve been using DevExpress for their WinForms and ASP.NET controls for years now, but this is our first experience with their WPF controls, and with automated UI tests, and the two dont seem to work well together.p  pIn particular, trying to play back a recorded test that interacts with a grid control never works right, and even on simple controls the playback seems to get confused over which editor it should be interacting with. In the action recordings our test lead is generating from MTM I see a lot of thisp  precodeType 5236 in PARTEditor text box Type 253 in PARTEditor text box codepre  pAnd even worse, inside of the gridsp  precodeClick FooterPanel pane  Last action on list item was not recorded because the control does not have any good identification property.

So, my questions arep  ol liIs there a way to get the DevX XPF controls to work better with codedautomated UI testsli liIf not, is there an alternative XPF control suite that is known to work well with codedautomated UI testsli ol  pIm specifically interested in a gridlike component with sorting, grouping, etc., a navbarlike component, and custom editors dates, numbers, etc, all which support a unified systemwide theming.p  pAlso, if this type of thing is easy enough to do using just native WPF controls and styles, that would be helpful to know as well.p  pEDIT Since there appears to be no WPF control suite that actually works with MTM, were being forced to use two separate testing tools at the sam time. Per several of the answers here, were strongly leaning towards TestComplete. Hopefully the situation improves soon.p

Negative 72270 pIm trying to set up two instances under an elastic load balancer, but cannot figure out how Im supposed to access the instances through the load balancer.p  pIve set up the instances with a security group to allow access from anywhere to certain ports.

Negative 72270 pMy issue is Im developing a mobilefriendly website with 2 stylesheets, one for the PCoriented visualization and the other for the mobile visualization. Along with the 2 CSS, I need a function to modify some codehrefcode attributes on the menu when switching from one visualization mode to the other.p  pIm not going deep into the details of the stuff as it would be very long and probably boring, anyway I need the function to be called embothem on codedocument.readycode AND on codewindow.resizecode, that is every time the window is resized.p  pSo I declared a function and named it codegoToAnchorcode in order to be able to call it more than oncep  precodedocument.readyfunction     function goToAnchor   ... modify some href attr ...     goToAnchor  codepre  pThats perfectly fine, but as I said I also need the function to be executed every time the window is resized, so I thought the code might look likep  precodedocument.readyfunction     function goToAnchor   ... modify some href attr ...     goToAnchor    window.resizegoToAnchor  codepre  pThe problem is simple, the function doesnt run on coderesizecode.

Negative 72270 pI have a shell function that is called from inside my map function. The shell function takes 2 parameters  an input file and an output file. Something like thisp  precodegt unixbinary pathininput.txt pathoutoutput.txt codepre  pThe problem is, that these input.txt files reside in HDFS and the output.txt files need to be written back to HDFS. Currently, I first copy the needed file with codefs.copyToLocalFilecode into the local hard drive, call the unix binary and then write the output.txt back to HDFS with codefs.copyFromLocalFilecode.  The problem with this  approach is that, it is not optimal because it involves substantial amount of redundant reading and writing to HDD which slows down the performance. So, my question is, how I can read the HDFS file directly as an input and output the results directly to HDFS  obviously,  codegtunixbinary hdfsmaster53410pathininput.txt hdfsmaster54310pathoutoutput.txtcode  will not work. Is there any other way around Can I treat an HDFS file as a loacl file somehow  I have access to the unixbinary source code written in C. Maybe changing the source code would help thanksp

When I submit the form on my localhost, it works properly by directing me to eitherp  pLOCALHOSTnew back to sign up page, registration info error or LOCALHOSTshow user profile, success.p  pWhen I push this same app to heroku and hit the submit button, it always leads me to this urlp  pappname.heroku.comformaction.aspfnameampemailamppasswordamppassword  which tells me  The page you were looking for doesnt exist.

Negative 72270 pIt might not be related, but this is under Android 2.3.3 and I work with openjdk7.p  pIm trying to compute the velocity and displacement of an object using its acceleration values, given coordinates in 3 spaces plus time.  For that, I created a class named codeCoord4Dcode, and codeVelocitycode, codeDisplacementcode and codeAccelerationcode are child of this class.  Like thisp  pcodeCoord4Dcodep  precodeclass Coord4D        Statics      private static final long ONETONANOFACTOR  1000000000       Members      private long key     private float xValue     private float yValue     private float zValue     ... more ...  codepre  pand an example of inheriting class codeVelocitycodep  precodepublic class Velocity extends Coord4D     ... members and methods and stuff ...   codepre  pAnd now the problem.  In codeCoord4Dcode, I generalize the method to obtain an antiderivative from derivatives.  For instance, I want to retrieve a codeVelocitycode instance given two codeAccelerationcode instances past and current and the codeVelocitycode instance from a previous frame.p  pEverything was working fine when the methods to do this were in codeDisplacementcode and codeVelocitycode, but I found it was redundant since both were computing the exact same things, and I hate writing two times the same lines of code.  So I decided to move these methods into codeCoord4Dcode, and to use generics like thisp  precodeprotected static ltDerivative extends Coord4D,  AntiDerivative extends Coord4Dgt AntiDerivative getIntegrationStep         Derivative previous,          Derivative current,          AntiDerivative previousStep       Time is in nanoseconds, must change it in seconds     float dT   current.getTime  previous.getTime                ONETONANOFACTOR       Parameters have seconds for unit  ..., s, , s, s, ...      float dX  current.getX  previous.getX     float dY  current.getY  previous.getY     float dZ  current.getZ  previous.getZ        do the integration step and add the previous step value     float x  dX  dT  previousStep.getX     float y  dY  dT  previousStep.getY     float z  dZ  dT  previousStep.getZ      return AntiDerivative new Coord4Dcurrent.getTime, x, y, z  codepre  pand the codeVelocitycode and codeDisplacementcode objects have this method example from codeVelocitycode.p  precodepublic static Velocity getVelocityAcceleration previousAccel,          Acceleration currentAccel,          Velocity initialVelo       return getIntegrationSteppreviousAccel,              currentAccel,              initialVelo    codepre  pNow, for some reason, this line p  precodereturn getIntegrationSteppreviousAccel, currentAccel, initialVelo codepre  presult in a codeClassCastExceptioncode.

Negative 72270 pI have a large application with a lot of threads and a lot of complex static objects. Currently, when a user logs out, the application is restarted to forcefully reset the application to its initial state.p  pThis process is being changed to a Windows service, so this approach is no longer possible. Likewise, the code is too much of a mess to properly implement a way to reset state when a user logs out.p  pI was thinking there might be an approach with writing the entire processs initial memory to disk, then loading it when a reset is requested, but this has many problems, such as not being able to save the kernelmode state.p  pI need a way however dirty to reset this process to its initial state, without actually restarting the process.

Negative 72270 pIf an HTML form field has focus and you hit enter, the form will be submitted unless youve done fancy things to bypass that.  Weirdly though, if JavaScript adds a field into the form, that entertosubmit behavior appears to break.  For examplep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSChas1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netSChas1ap  precodefunction goose     document.getElementByIdaddhere.innerHTMLltinput namegoose valuehonkgt   function checkForm    alertok     ltform onsubmitcheckFormgt   ltinput nameduck valuequackgt   ltdiv idaddheregtltdivgt   ltformgt ltbutton onclickgoosegtadd a gooseltbuttongt codepre  p This is a contrived example attempting to be as concise as possible.  The original code involved is more modern code with events attached in JavaScript, etc.  But this is the simplest code that replicates the issue.  Also, it emisem necessary in the real use case to dynamically modify the form by addingremoving fields.p  pAnyway, youll get a form that has a single field with a value duck.  Click into it and hit enter, and the form will submit youll see an ok alert and then JSFiddle will tell you not to post.p  pHowever, if you click add a goose, you get a new field.  And now, you cannot hit enter to submit the form.p  pWhy is this happening  I cant find anything about this behavior via google, perhaps Im using the wrong search terms.  But it happens in IE on Windows and Chrome and FF on OSX at least.  So it seems like an intentional, perhaps tospecification, behavior.  Is it some kind of security protectionp  pAnd, is there any way to restore the entertosubmit behavior on the form once a field is inserted  A way other than to add onkey events to the input fieldsp  pFWIW, it doesnt seem to matter if the inputs are added via DOM methods appendChild, or setting the innerHTML, using jQuery or old fashioned JavaScript.p

Negative 72270 pI assume this is would be a basic question however, my math skills are lacking.p  pI am working on an iphone game where people draw their own platform to bounce an egg up.p  pThe game consists of a platform connecting 2 nodes each of these nodes has an x and y value this platform can be at any angle depending on how the user draws it,  when something hits this platform I need it to hit off perpendicularly.  I know how much total power I need, how would I break it down between X and Y.  I drew a picture to better explain...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaEfQ4.jpg altTwo examples of my problem each for a different directionp  pHere are two examples the info I have about the problem is the X amp Y coordinate of the nodes, and the length of the dotted perpendicular line.  What I need to find is the length of the X and Y lines and if the X is going in a positive or negative direction.p

When I edit any cell in the grid, onEditCell event is called. Now, I want to call ccStatTracker.modifyCCMap from an event handler function attached to onEditCell event. As I go on modifying the cells, this event will be called asynchronously which will in turn call a function modifyCCMap which will modify private member CCMap  of my Javascript object. So the latest state of my CCMap as seen by two calls might be different right So what is the best way to handle this Is there something as Synchronized in Javascript as in Javap  pPlease help me as it will determine the approach we want to take for implementing this.p

Negative 72270 pi am in the process of porting some of my Windows Phone Applications to Android using Xamarin Monodroid.p  pI am pretty new with the Xamarin stuff, just bought a license actually.p  pSo far so good as far as recreating the XAML UI in AXML but i am facing a problem with Custom Controls.p  pHere is what i mean by custom controlsp  pIn .NET, i created a bunch of controls by creating class that inherit from the UserControl class, i created the logic and set the Content. Then i just create new instance with new mycontrol, etc...p  pSome of my controls are not created this way but instead i created the UserControl by defining the XAML, where there is no specific logics but when i need to combine 2 or more controlsfor example, a colored square with text beside it, so Rectangle  TextBlock and again i just need to do new mycontrol and add it somewhere in the XAML UIGrid, ListBox, StackPanel, etc....p  pHow can i achieve something similar with Monodroidp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 72270 pI am creating a script to include hard code and click tags for web advertising. Basically Im trying to make the process easier by having all of my html links in one file, but controlled with if statements.p  pSo far it works fine, but I get kick backs from googleaolyahoo because when they go through the swf they see these other html links, even though they are not being used, and kick back the banner.p  pIm trying now to include two files, one with hard codes, and another with just click tags.

So I would remove my hardtags.as from the folder before I publish. But this is throwing an error saying it cant find the file. To me though, because hardclicktags  false it should ignore this line all together.p  pIs there a way around this, or am I kind of stuck going about this a different wayp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 72270 pMy project has their tests using the NUnit framework, specifically 2.5.9.  My build process currently creates nunit xml files, and then I convert them into .trx and publish them into TFS using mstest.exe.  Now, I need to report back code coverage to TFS and show up in the build summary reports.  I can create NCover results to xml, and was hoping I could include the NCover results into the NUnit xml and then convert it into the .TRX format and then import to TFS, but thats not going to work.  But, it does look like the .TRX file can accept some code coverage information, according to the vsts.xsd, but Im not sure if it is a file reference or other metrics.p  pI can also create .Coverage result files using Visual Instrumentation using an example from here  a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvststestthreadc7cd8dabfed94fc49773bdb047ad5958 relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvststestthreadc7cd8dabfed94fc49773bdb047ad5958ap  pSo, I know I can publish unit test to TFS.

Negative 72270 pSorry for the many questions but Im new to Symfony.   I made a form and all it working well.  I a few fields for pictures Picture1, Picture2, Picture3, etc.   I used te sfWidgetFormInputFile and all is working well with that as well.   It uploads the file where it needs to and it gives it a unique name.p  pThe problem Im having is that those fields are set in mySQL to have a default value of nopic.png so that if the user doesnt upload a picture, it will still have something to show in the post.   But every time someone uploads a picture, it deletes my nopic.png file and the posts without a picture show with a blank square.  Im thinking its because its set to delete previous image before uploading the new one to reduce excess unused pictures on the server.p  pIm wondering if theres a way to have it check to see if the value is nopic.png before deleting it from the folder.  In case it helps, this is the code Im using in the form.class file.  p  precode      thisgtwidgetSchema[picture1]  new sfWidgetFormInputFilearraylabel gt Pictures,    thisgtvalidatorSchema[picture1]  new sfValidatorFilearrayrequired gt false, path gt sfConfiggetsfuploaddir.car, mimetypes gt webimages,    thisgtwidgetSchema[picture1]  new sfWidgetFormInputFileEditablearray     label gt Pictures,     filesrc gt uploadscar.thisgtgetObjectgtgetPicture1,     isimage gt true,     editmode gt thisgtisNew,     template gt ltdivgtfileltbr gtinputltbr gtdeletedeletelabelltdivgt,        thisgtvalidatorSchema[picturedelete]  new sfValidatorPass codepre

So one ugly possiblity would be to just have a StatusGrouping property on the Case class. And then have a StatusPublic property on the StatusGrouping class, and then have EF hook up the hierarchy when I read my data.p  pBut the StatusGrouping table is just a relation table that I dont care about in this case. Also, I dont care about the PublicStatusId, all I care about is that I want the right StatusPublic.Name mapped into my PublicStatusName in the Case class whenever I fetch a Case from the db.p  pThis is probably basic stuff. It would be very easy in something like iBATIS now MyBatis. Im sure it is easy in EF as well.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 72270 pstrongSummarystrongp  pIll start with the summary and then follow with the details. For my project, automatic migration is not happening on the live .sdf database file in the working directory.  Its as if that .sdf file didnt exist.  Instead, all configuration actions are performed on a new, empty database file which it creates on in the codeProgram FilesMicrosoft Visual Studio 10.0Common7IDEcode directory.  How do I get it to work on my live .sdf database file in the working directoryp  pstrongDetailsstrongp  pThe project uses Code First EF in Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate.  The project was started with EF 4.1, and I just updated the project to EF 4.4.p  pThe database file is a SQL Server Compact Edition 4.0 file, which is located in the same directory as the executable i.e., the working directory.  Everything has been working fine for some time now, but I want to add two new DbSets to the DbContext, and hence two new tables to the database file.  When I deploy the new version of the program to customers, I want the program to seamlessly just add the two new tables to the database, and continue on as if nothing had happened, leaving untouched all the extant data in the other tables.p  pstrongAttempt 1strongp  pPer the process described in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenUSdatajj554735httpmsdn.microsoft.comenUSdatajj554735ap  pI added to two new DbSets to the DbContextderived class.  When I attempted to run the program, I got the following exception  codeThe model backing the DrillContext context has changed since the database was created. Consider using Code First Migrations to update the databasecode.  This is what I expected to happen, since I hadnt yet enabled migrations.p  pIn the Package Management Console I then issued the commandp  precodeEnableMigrations EnableAutomaticMigrations. codepre  pThe system created a codeMigrationscode directory with a codeConfiguration.cscode file in it.p  pI then ran thep  precodeUpdateDatabase codepre  pcommand, and got the message codeNo pending codebased migrationscode.  I checked the live database file in the working directory, and it was unchanged.  There was, however, a new database file with the same name in the codeProgram FilesMicrosoft Visual Studio 10.0Common7IDEcode directory that had the same name and was an empty database with all the appropriate tables, including the two tables corresponding to the two new DbSets in the DbContextderived class, and a new table named codeMigrationHistorycode, which has a single entry in it.  The live .sdf file remained untouched, without the new tables, and with no codeMigrationHistorycode table.p  pstrongAttempt 2, which uses an InitialMigrationstrongp  pPer a hrefhttpwww.ladislavmrnka.com201203ef43migrationsandexistingdatabasehttpwww.ladislavmrnka.com201203ef43migrationsandexistingdatabaseap  pTo prepare for the second attempt I restored the programs original state i.e., to the state it was before I attempted the migrations by doing 3 things.  I removed the 2 new DbSets from the DbContextderived class.  I deleted the Migrations directory and the enclosed Configuration.cs file, and deleted the useless database file .sdf file in the ...Common7IDE directory.p  pI then executed the commandp  precodeEnableMigrations EnableAutomaticMigrations codepre  pwhich created the Migrations directory and the Configurations.cs file.p  pI then executed thep  precodeAddMigration InitialMigration IgnoreChanges codepre  pcommand, which added an code201208281905525InitialMigration.cscode file to the Migrations directory.p  pThen, per the directions on the cited web page, I modified the codeUpcode method in the file so that the codeInitialMigrationcode class became the followingp  precodepublic partial class InitialMigration  DbMigration      public override void Up              SqlDROP TABLE EdmMetadata           public override void Down            codepre  pI then executed thep  precodeUpdateDatabase codepre  pcommand, and got the message codeThe specified table does not exist.code  I checked the live database in the working directory, and found that there is indeed an EdmMetadata table in the database.  I then checked the code...Common7IDEcode directory and found that the new database that had been created there did NOT have the table.p  pSo all migration activity is occurring on the code...Common7IDEcode version of the file but not on the live database file in the working directory.p  pHow do I get it to work on the existing, live database filep  pThanks,p

Negative 72270 pHi I have a strange question about java.  I will leave out the background info so as not to complicate it.  If you have a variable named fname.  And say you have a function returning a String that is fname.  Is there a way to say reference the identifier fname via the String fname.  The idea would be something like fname.toIdentifier  value but obviously toIdentifier isnt a real method. p  pI suppose a bit of background mite help.  Basically I have a string fname mapped to another string the value of fname.  And I want a way to quickly say the variable fname  the value of the key fname from the map.  Im getting the key value pair from iterating over a map of cookies in the form .  And I dont want to do if key  fname set fname to value of fname because I have a ton of variables that need to be set that way.  Id rather do something like currentkey.toIdentifer  thevalue.  Weird question maybe Im overlooking a much easier way to approach this.p

Negative 72270 pThis post is meant to be more a discussionstarter, as I am somewhat new to unit testing and TDD.  p  pI am currently writing some unit tests for a .NET process that interacts with several databases, and am using mock database contexts in an attempt to cover different edge cases within my tests, verify exception handling in the program itself, among other things. That being said, some of my unit tests use valid data, while others do not.p  pI am looking for feedback in terms of suggested best practices when adding validfake data to your mock database contexts.  Ive seen people do this a number of ways e.g.  implement repository pattern, adding mock data to .csv files and making them part of the project, etc....p  pIm currently thinking about using a repository pattern for adding codeSurveycode objects to the codeSurveyscode table in my target DB.p  pFirst off, Ive got the interfacep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic interface ISurveyRepository     IQueryableltSurveygt SurveySeries  get   codepre  pThis is implemented both for the mocking fakevalid data repositories as needed by unit tests p  precodeclass FakeSurveyRepository  ISurveyRepository     private static IQueryableltSurveygt fakeSurveySeries  new ListltSurveygt        new Survey  id  1, SurveyNameNotValid1, SurveyDataltdatagtfakeltdatagt,       new Survey  id  2, SurveyNameNotValid2, SurveyDataltdatagtsuper fakeltdatagt,       .........,       new Survey id  10, SurveyNameNotValid10, SurveyDataltdatagtthe fakestltdatagt            .AsQueryable     public IQueryableltSurveygt SurveySeries             get  return fakeSurveySeries        RealSurveyRepository  ISurveyRepository is similar to this, but with good data codepre  pI then have a class to consume this data for either fakevalid data by being passed a reference to the series in the constructorp  precodepublic class SurveySeriesProcessor     private ISurveyRepository surveyRepository     public SurveySeriesProcessor ISurveyRepository surveyRepository             this.surveyRepository  surveyRepository         public IQueryableltSurveygt GetSurveys           return surveyRepository.SurveySeries       codepre  pAnd can then approach using these objects in my tests such asp  precode[TestClass] public class SurveyTests      [TestMethod]     WhenInvalidSurveysFoundSurveyCopierThrowsInvalidSurveyDataErrorForEach              create mocking DB context and add fake data        var contextFactory  new ContextFactory ContextType.Mocking         var surveySeriesProcessor  new SurveySeriesProcessor new FakeSurveyRepository          foreachSurvey surveyRecord in surveySeriesProcessor.GetSurveys                    contextFactory.TargetDBContext.Surveys.AddObject surveyRecord                  instantiate object being tested and run it against fake test data        var testSurveyCopier  new SurveyCopier contextFactory         testSurveyCopier.Start         test behavior        ListltErrorMessagegt errors  testSurveyCopier.ErrorMessages        errors.Count.ShouldEqual surveySeriesProcessor.GetSurveys.Count         foreachErrorMessage errMsg in errors                   errMsg.ErrorCode.ShouldEqualErrorMessage.ErrorMessageCode.InvalidSurveyData               codepre  pNOTE I realize that in the example code provided I dont necessarily need to make the classes implementing codeISurveyRepositorycode return the series as an codeIQueryableltSurveygtcode they could very well be codeListltSurveygtcode. However, I am going to extend the functionality of the interface and these classes in the future to filter out the fakevalid series based on certain criteria added to LINQ queries, which is why I made the repositories implement codeIQueryableltgtcode. This is mockup code designed to convey the basic principles of what Im thinking.p  pWith all of this in mind, what Im asking is p  ol liDo you have any suggestions in terms of alternative approaches I could take in such scenariosli liWhat methods have you employed in the past, what did you likenot like about them Which have you found were the easiest to maintainli liGiven what Ive posted, do you notice flaws in my general approach to unit testing Sometimes I feel as though I write unit tests that attempt to cover too much ground instead of being concise, elegant, and tothepoint.li ol  pThis is meant to be somewhat of an open discussion.

There are other files that I did not put here for space.  But the problem that I have and I have tried on several machines and operation systems is that the buttons on the window seem to hang.  I can select the window and click on the buttons and they highlight like they were hit but nothing happens.  I have a tabbed plane and clicking on the other tabs also does nothing.  Some times this last for about 15 seconds and other times it lasts several minutes.  But it always eventually comes back and will respond to new input ie it does not remember all the click around I did before it came back.  The application overall is simple in that it sits waiting until a user does something before it does something so I am confused on why it seems to hang.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 72270 pYesterday, I spent some time thinking about caching.p  pSpecifically, caching data.p  pI am using ASP.NET 4.0, coding in VB. Im using a MySQL database, so cannot use the SQL Serveronly sqlDependency.p  pIt is important to me that all data changes are acted upon and no user sees old data, so I have had to come up with something to monitor database changes on specific tables.p  pWhat I have come up with is this...p  p1 A routine which creates a KeyValue Dictionary in the Cache which contains any table names which have recently been written to, and a writetime timestamp, iep  precodetableName         timeStamp Unix table2Name        timeStamp codepre  p2 A commonly available function which is called when writing any data, ie all INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE commands are created by passing two arguments to this function, codesqlcode and codetableChangescode.p  pIn this function, codesqlcode is simply the UPDATEINSERT code and codetableChangescode is a comma separated list of table names which will be affected by this command.p  pIt is during any amendment that the table in point 1 is created.p  p3 A commonly available codegetDatacode function, which takes arguments p  precode cacheName As String       the cache key name  slidingTime As Double     sliding expiry period converted to minutes within the function  dependancy As Object      standard cache dependancy object  newSql As String          the query required to get this data  Optional tableDependencies As String    a comma separated list of tables which this data is dependant on codepre  p4 A function for writing a data object to the cache based on similar arguments to those above.p  pNow, function 3 first checks if the cache contains the key passed into it, if not, then it simply goes off to the database and fetches new data.p  pIf it does contain this key, then it does two things, firstly it gets a time stamp of when this item was added, which is always codecacheKeyaddedcode created in the process of adding a cache item, then having got this time stamp, it grabs the comma separated codetableDependenciescode, turns it into a List of table names, loops through them all checking the corresponding table update time using table name as key from the cached data codeDictionarycode created in the first function.p  pIf any of the table update times are more recent than the cache time, then it goes off to the database and fetches new data, if not, it returns the cached data.p  pSimilarly, if there is no codeDictionarycode of tables held in the cache it returns cached data as the assumption is no changes have been made as this cache object is only created when a change is made to the database.p  pThe data is always held on a sliding cache time, typically quite short, and of course data which doesnt need caching at all can be grabbed directly without this process.p  pI havent posted the code for any of the above as its not necessarily relevant to my actual question, but the background is important.p  pSo, my actual question isp  pGiven that the above works fine for determining when any tables in my database have changed providing nothing is changed in phpMyAdmin, but as only one person has access to that, in my case this is fine... how can I apply the same principle to caching User Controls or Pagesp  pSo, I have cached user controls using  codeVaryByParamPARAcode and  codeVaryByCustomCUSTOMVALUEcode successfully in the past. It stands to reason that codeVaryByCustomcode is the way to go... but how would I reliably pass parameters table names and last cache time of the page into a custom function to do this... OR, am I talking nonsensep  pAdditionally, is there any way to get the cache write time without having to save an additional codeaddedcode key to every cache itemp

There is an auction website, and I figured it would be nice for Emacs to check whether there has been an update. I did this using codeRcode EmacsESS to load source code of the website.

Negative 72270 pI have an API that I am pulling data from, and I want to collect all the tags from this API...but I dont know the number of tags in advance, and the API throttles access via the max number of results returned in any 1 call 100. It has an unlimited number of pages though.p  pSo a call may look like this codeTag.updatetags100, 5code where code100code is the max number of objects returned in 1 call and code5code is the page to begin i.e. if you assume that the tags are stored sequentially, what this is saying is return the tag records with IDs in the range of code401  500code.p  pThe issue is, I dont want to manually have to enter code5code i.e. I dont know what the upper limit is. There is no way for me to ping the total number of tags if there were, I would simply divide it and put this call in a loop up to that number.p  pAll I do know is that once it reaches a page that doesnt have any results, it will return an empty array code[]code.p  pSo, how do I loop through all the tags and stop when the result returned is an empty array which would be the final result returned and therefore not evaluatedp  pWhat does that loop look likep

Negative 72270 pI am using the codeDatePickercode control in the original WPF toolkit.p  pI am trying to remove the codeDatePickercode from the tab order. Setting properties like codeIsTabStopcode or codeTabIndexcode or codeKeyboardNavigation.IsTabStopcode dont really work. Setting codeTabIndexcode to 1 for example removes it from the tab order until I reach the end of the tab order on my form and it cycles back to the beginning which is the behavior I want. Once it has cycled the codeDatePickercode is back in the tab order.p  pThe problem seems to be that codeDatePickercode encapsulates a codeTextBoxcode which is the actual tab stop.p  pHow can I set the codeIsTabStopcode property of codeDatePickercodes codeTextBoxcode in XAMLp
Negative 72270 pThis is a very simple and pointless example of a var type that has enumerator properties. The point of the snippet is to experiment with a collection using a stronglytyped class that implements the codeIEnumeratorcode interface. p  precodepublic class num  public int value  get set    class Program       private int[] data   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10       static void Mainstring[] args           Program p  new Program         var numbers  selectNumbersp.data           foreachnum x in numbers              Console.WriteLineFound 0, x.value.ToString                   Console.WriteLinepress [enter] to exit         Console.Read           static IEnumerableltnumgt selectNumbersint[] x          in production app the following would use a reader to get data from database         forint i  0 i lt x.Length i              yield return new num  value  x[i]              Console.WriteLineFound 0, x[i].ToString  ltltlt1                codepre  pThe results returned to the console are slightly strange. The results seem to suggest that every time an iteration of the codeforeachcode loop executes line 1 also executes.p  pDoes this mean that if I implemented this structure to database setting application, where codeselectNumberscode involved getting in touch with our database, would it then be making a connection every time IEnumerator is used e.g. every time it then uses a codeforeachcode loop on the stronglytyped codenumcode would it be getting in touch with our database The results of this example seem to suggest that it would.p

Negative 72270 pI am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comlaverdetnodefibers relnofollowFibersa to solve a problem regarding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16378094runnodejseventloopwaitforchildprocesstofinishhow to yield control to the event loop in node.js, pausing the execution of some synchronous codea. This works well, mostly, but I encountered a strange crashing but, and I am not able to find the reason for it.p  h2Setuph2  pThere are three processp  ul liA main server process, it receives code to instrument and execute. When it receives new code to execute it use childprocess.fork to spawnli liAn execution process. This instruments the received code to call a specific callback from time to time to report what happened in the executed code. It then executes the code in a sandbox created by using a hrefhttpsgithub.combrianmcdcontextify relnofollowContextifya. Sometimes these reports include incorrect location information about the line and column in the code something happens. In that case a source map is needed to map locations in the instrumented code to locations in the original code. But calculating this source map takes a significant amount of time. Therefore, before starting the execution the execution process spawnsli liA a hrefhttpsgithub.commozillasourcemap relnofollowsource mapa calculation process. This just takes the original code and the instrumented code and calculates a source map. When its done it sends the finished source map to the execution process and exits.li ul  pIf the execution process needs the source map in a callback before the execution is finished, it will use Fiber.yield to yield control to the event loop and thus pause the execution. When the execution process then receives the data it continues the execution using pausedFiber.run.p  pThis is implemented like sop  precode server.js  main process function executeCodecodeToExecute      var runtime  fork.runtime      runtime.onuncaught exception, function exception          console.logAn uncaught exception occured in process with id   id   , exception         console.logexception.stack          runtime.onexit, function code, signal          console.logChild process exited with code   code   after receiving signal   signal          runtime.send type code, code code  codepre  pandp  precode runtime.js  execution process var pausedExecution, sourceMap, messagesToSend  [] function getSourceMap      if sourceMap  undefined          console.logWaiting for source map.         pausedExecution  Fiber.current         Fiber.yield         pausedExecution  undefined         console.logWait is over.           if sourceMap  null          throw new ErrorSource map could not be generated.      else           we should have a proper source map now         return sourceMap        function callbackmessage      console.logMessage, message.type     if message.type  console log           the location of the console log message will be the location in the instrumented code          we have to adjust it to get the position in the original code         message.loc  getSourceMap.originalPositionFormessage.loc          messagesToSend.pushmessage  gather messages in a buffer       do not forward messages every time, instead gather a bunch and send them all at once     if messagesToSend.length gt 100          console.logSending messages.         process.sendtype message batch, messages messagesToSend         messagesToSend.splice0  empty the array         function to send messages when we get a chance to prevent the client from waiting too long function sendMessagesWithEventLoopTurnaround      if messagesToSend.length gt 0          process.sendtype message batch, messages messagesToSend         messagesToSend.splice0  empty the array          setTimeoutsendMessagesWithEventLoopTurnAround, 10   function executeCodecode       setup child process to calculate the source map     importantDataCalculator  fork.runtime     importantDataCalculator.onmessage, function msg          if msg.type  result              importantData  msg.data             console.logFinished source map generation          else if msg.type  error              importantData  null          else              throw new ErrorUnknown message from dataGenerator                   if pausedExecution               execution is waiting for the data             pausedExecution.run                      setup automatic messages sending in the event loop     sendMessagesWithEventLoopTurnaround       instrument the code to call a function called callback, which will be defined in the sandbox     instrumentCodecode       prepare the sandbox     var sandbox  Contextifynew utils.Sandboxcallback  the callback to be called from the instrumented code is defined in the sandbox       wrap the execution of the code in a Fiber, so it can be paused     Fiberfunction           sandbox.runcode          send messages because the execution finished         console.logSending messages.         process.sendtype message batch, messages messagesToSend         messagesToSend.splice0  empty the array     .run   process.onmessage, function msg      if msg.type  code          executeCodemsg.code, msg.options       codepre  pSo to summarize  When new code is received a new process is created to execute it. This process first instruments and then executes it. Before doing so it starts a third process to calculate a source map for the code. The instrumented code calls the function named codecallbackcode in the code above handing messages to the runtime that report progress of the executing code. These have to be adjusted sometimes, one example for which an adjustment is necessary are console log messages. To do this adjustment, the source map calculated by the third process is necessary. When the callback needs the source map it calls getSourceMap which waits for the sourceMap process to finish its calculation and yields control to the event loop during that waiting time to enable itself to receive messages from the sourceMap process otherwise the event loop would be blocked and no message could be received.p  pMessages passed to the callback are first stored in an array and then sent as a batch to the main process for performance reasons. However, we do not want the main process to wait too long for messages so in addition to sending a batch of messages when the threshold is reached we scheduled a function codesendMessagesWithEventLoopTurnAroundcode to run in the event loop and check whether there are messages to send. This has two advantagesp  ol liWhen the execution process is waiting for the source map process it can use the time to send the messages it already got. So if the sourceMap process takes several seconds to finish, the main process does not have to wait the same time for messages that have already been created and contain correct data.li liWhen the executing code generates only very little messages in the event loop e.g. by a function scheduled with codesetTimeIntervalf, 2000code which only creates one single message per execution it does not have to wait a long time until the message buffer is full in this example 200s but receives updates about the progress every 10ms if anything changed.li ol  h2The Problemh2  pstrongWhat worksstrongp  pThis setup works fine in the following casesp  ol liI do not use fibers and a separate process to calculate the source map. Instead I calculate the source map before the code is executed. In that case all the code to execute I tried works as expected.li liI do use fibers and a separate process and execute code for which I do not need the source map. E.g.  codevar a  2codebr orbr codesetTimeoutfunction   var a  2, 10codeli ol  pIn the first case the output looks like this.p  precodeStarting source map generation. Message variables init Message program finished Sending messages. Finished source map generation. Source map generator process exited with code 0 after receiving signal null codepre  ol liI do use fibers and a separate process and code for which I need the source map but that doesnt use the event loop, e.g. codeconsole.logfoocode  li ol  pIn that case the output looks like thisp  precodeStarting source map generation. Message console log Waiting for source map generation. Finished source map generation. Wait is over. Message  program finished Sending messages. Source map generator process exited with code 0 after receiving signal null codepre  ol liI do use fibers and a separate process and code for which I need the source map and which uses the event loop, but the source map is only needed when the source map calculation is already finished so no waiting. li ol  pE.g.p  precodesetTimeoutfunction       console.logfoo , 100  the source map generation takes around 100ms codepre  pIn that case the output looks like thisp  precodeStarting source map generation. Message function declaration Message program finished Sending messages. Finished source map generation. Source map generator process exited with code 0 after receiving signal null Message function enter Message console log Message function exit Sending messages in event loop. codepre  pstrongWhat doesnt workstrongp  pIt only breaks if I use fibers and separate processes and code that uses the event loop but needs the source map before it is finished, e.g.p  precodesetTimeoutfunction       console.logfoo , 10  the source map generation takes around 100ms codepre  pThe output then looks like thisp  precodeStarting source map generation.

Negative 72270 pI am having to create a login form on one of the pages of a wordpress site I have just inherited. I am absolutely new to both wordpress and php. The idea is to create a login form and on submission this would contact a .net web service which would then return a value saying whether the user is a valid one. The .net part of it is all fine. I just tested it with a small php code snippet and it works. Based on the return value, I need to create an authentication ticket for the user in wordpress. How do I go about this I seem to have no clue. I tried using the in built forms that comes with wordpress. As much as it is sophisticated, there is no apparent way to establish a soap connection to a Web service and all that. Please help.p

Negative 72270 pI was working with a templated class which takes a set of integers. The code was like,p  precodetemplateltunsigned... Idxgt struct work ...  codepre  pThen I realized, user may need to provide either a set of integers, or a range of integers. So, I changed the syntax little to support instantiation like,p  precodeworkltindexeslt1,3,2,4gt gt instead of worklt1,3,2,4gt workltspanlt1,4gt gt same as worklt1,2,3,4gt  codepre  pWhile, in C we have large number of operators, and can be used to formulate exotic expression templates say codeboostxpressivecode, codeboostlambdacode, codeboostspiritcode etc , possibilities for type manipulation is much less.p  pIn a boostcon keynote by Sean Parent, he noted one still can not write codepairltintgtcode to denote codea pair of integerscode. In my persinal library, I made a syntax like codetupleltint[3]gtcode to denote a tuple of 3 integers, instead of writing a tuple with 3 int in the type arguments, noting that I do not write a raw array as tuple argument anywhere note codestdarrayltint,3gtcode is not same as the above, as stdarray can not store references while codetuplecode can, say codestdtupleltintamp,intamp,intampgtcode is possiblep  pSo, I want to know what are the different kind of type expressions I can write p  pSo far I can think of object type, function type, reference type, withwithout cv modifiers, pointers etc. e.gp  precode    templateltclass Tgt     struct tpl      using t1  tplltintgtsimple type     function can have function pointerreference also       e.g. voidint,float or voidampint,float     using t2  tplltvoidint,floatgt     array can have pointer  reference also     e.g. intamp[4] or int [4]     using t3  tplltint[4]gt     using t4  tplltint[]gt     using t5  tplltint constgtwith cv modifiers     using t6  tplltintgtwith pointer     using t7  tplltintampgtwith reference amp or ampamp     using t8  tpllttplltintgt gt template itself     using t9  tplltvoid...gt variadic functions     using t10  tplltR Cgt pointer to member codepre  pBut I believe, many more are possible.p  pNOTE This question is purely theoretical, strongI just want to know all kinds of syntax I can write inside lt as type argumentstrong, and not about the readabilitymorality aspect of it, or even how can I implement some of the examples I had given, like the work class.   p

Negative 72270 pThe question about access to protected member in Java was already asked and answered a lot of times, for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3540640javaprotectedaccessacrosspackagerq1Java  protected access across packageap  pBut I cant understand why it is implemented this way, see explanation from Java Programming Language 4 ed.p  pThe reasoning behind the restriction is this Each subclass inherits the contract of the superclass and expands that contract in some way. Suppose that one subclass, as part of its expanded contract, places constraints on the values of protected members of the superclass. If a different subclass could access the protected members of objects of the first subclass then it could manipulate them in a way that would break the first subclasss contract and this should not be permissible.p  pOK, thats clear, but consider this inheritance structure extract from some codep  precodepackage package1      public class A          protected int x       package package2  public class B extends A      public static void mainString[] args         C subclass  new C         subclass.x  7   here any constraints can be broken          class C extends B       class which places constraints on the value of protected member x     ...  codepre  pHere subclass.x  7 is a valid statement which still can break a Cs contract.  What am I missing p  pEdited added Maybe I should not apply the cited logic in this situation If we were dealing with only one package, the no restrictions exist at all. So maybe direct inheritance chain is treated in simplified way, meaning that superclass must know what it is doing... p

Because it could be null then the foreign key checks wont stop FooClass being deleted so I have to check myself.p  precode    class FooClass  ... some properties       class BarClass  ... some properties       class FooAndOrBar              public int Id  get set          public FooClass Foo  get set          public BarClass Bar  get set       codepre  pTherefore, following good practice for validating entries that cut across multiple database entries, I added a test to Entity Frameworks ValidateEntity method as shown below. p  precode    protected override DbEntityValidationResult ValidateEntity         DbEntityEntry entityEntry, IDictionaryltobject, objectgt items              if entityEntry.Entity is FooClass ampamp              entityEntry.State  EntityState.Delete                                     if ... entityEntry.Entity is used in DbContext.FooAndOrBars ...                 return new DbEntityValidationResult... error ...                   return base.ValidateEntityentityEntry, items       codepre  pThe problem is that ValidateEntity does not seem to be called on delete. That makes sense why validate something you are going to delete but leaves me with the problem of where should I put the check I do use a UnitOfWorkrepository pattern and could put a test in there, but that smells. p  pHad anyone else come across this problem and solved it in a clean way Your input would be appreciated. p  h1ANSWER FROM Pawel see below.h1  ppawel pointed out that you can override ShouldValidateEntity so that ValidateEntity is called for deleted items. Here is some example code in case someone else finds this useful.p  precode ltsummarygt  Override ShouldValidateEntity to cause deleted entities to be checked as well  ltsummarygt protected override bool ShouldValidateEntityDbEntityEntry entityEntry      if entityEntry.State  EntityState.Deleted         return true      return base.ShouldValidateEntityentityEntry  codepre  pI actually made the check a bit tighter than just all deleted items by checking for the type of the entity, but that is just to improve performance.p

Negative 72270 pI am trying to find the most central character in a data set that contains every Marvel character and every book theyve been in. The code I have written below works for a small test file that we created ourselves to test the method more quickly but when I run the code on the Marvel file, the code breaks from the very beginning. I put print statements through the whole code to find where it stopped working and I thought it would be something to do with iterating through so many characters but it doesnt work right from the start. In the very first while loop I add startVertex to the group and I wrote a System.out.printlngroup statement right after I added startVertex and when I run the test, the print statement gives [] which Im pretty sure means that the group isnt getting any anything from startVertex and then gets stuck in an infinite loop but for a small list of charactersbooks the code works perfectly fine...

Negative 72270 pI have a code which uses JAXB with SAX to unmarshal an xml source to java object. Later I read a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee5apijavaxxmlbindUnmarshaller.html relnofollowthisa document and came to know that if I dont provide a SAX parser, the JAXB provider will choose a default parser. What does default parser means If I do not provide a SAX 2.0 parser will it parse the document using DOM or any other technique Or will it use a SAX parser which is less than 2.0 version.p  pWe are using the javax.xml.bind jaxbapi. How can I know which SAX parser it uses. If I have to definitely use a SAX2.0 compilant parser with JAXB then, what the different parsers available. What is all this confusion I totally messed. Atleast I want to read a good document which explains about parsing techniques, which parser to use and different kinds of parsers and different kind of JAXB providers etc.p  pTill now I only know that JAXB is a specification. Standard java distributed by Oracle gives a default implementation of the specification. Besides there are other implementations like Metro, Eclipselink MOXy, apache camels JAXB implementation. Just now I came to know that there are different parser versions used in parsing techniques if I understood properly.p

Negative 72270 pIm having problems with understanding the concept of its use with several projects. Assume I have 4 projects p  ul liBusiness.Servicesli liPresentation.MVCli liPresentation.WebApili ul  pBusiness.Services is the project where all the business logic and db connections occur. MVC, Web Api project references services to call business logic. MVC and web api does not have any interaction with each other because they are completely for different purpose in my case. Web Api only stands for dealing with mobile client requestsresponses. p  pIn my MVC project I provide a login to my users and after making a successful login I create codeFormsAuthenticationTicketcode and with the help of this ticket I execute a custom authorization if the user is available for specified action. In addition to this, I create IPrincipal based on my codeFormsAuthenticationTicketcode data in Authorization. After setting this I can reach it with like codeHttpContext.Current.Usercode.p  pOn the other hand, in my Web Api project, Basic authentication is needed for all requests. There is a login action where user needs to send LoginName and Password in order to get a token that is going to be used for future requests. Once token is retrieved by client, client adds token parameter at the end of query string. When the request reaches the Web Api, it enters my codeCustomAuthorizationAttributecode and again check if the user is eligible for that request. Moreover, I set codeThread.CurrentPrincipalcode and codeHttpContext.Current.Usercode to a codeIPrincipalcode object which is determined by token.p  pThese are for now so far so good. The problem starts off here. I wanted to put SignalR into my Presentation.WebApi project. As far as I understand OWIN is on top of all of MVC, WebApi, thus, we dont need to have authentication system if we have already one. So that the first question is how can I create authorization over this signalr I get the Context.UserIPrincipal naturally null. It seems ok because in my web api IPrincipal object was set by per request in codeCustomAuthorizationAttrbutecode . Moreover, how can I authorize user coming from codePresentation.MVCcode Should I provide a new method for mvc user that provide a token to him May I use its FormsAuthenticationTicket data in order to make it authorize  p

Negative 72270 pI found similar questions but no satisfactory answers. In addition, most answers were rather old as well, so I wonder if the combination eclipse  Junit got better in the meantime. p  pInstead of packing projects into test suites, I would like to spread tests cases all over the place in the package structure Im programming in Java. Then right clicking on whatever package on the package explorer should bring the option Run As  JUnit Test and run all the unit tests in that package and below recursively. In this way, I wouldnt have to care about maintaining the test structure, it would be in the packages themselves.p  pIve seen that this works only with end packages with no children, but not recursively.

Ill have this copyloss issue dozens or hundreds of times.p  pI found one reference from strike2003strike March, 2004 to dynamically identify missing strikecodestrike strongEDIT2strong [Event Procedure] references in the properties box amp set the property to [Event Procedure] to fix this. However, when trying to identify if an object should have an event handler, the code relies on this statementp  precodeDLookupEventProcedureSuffix, EventProcedures, EventName   amp prpCurr.Name amp  codepre  pand that generates an error 3078 saying it cannot find a table or query named EventProcedures strongEDIT2strong which seems to have been a system table in the older version of Access that the code was based on. Does anyone know what happened to the EventProcedures table in Access 2010 Has it been renamed, is it no longer accessible, is there a replacementp  pThis also begs the question of how do I fire this code in the first place. I have it on the OnOpen event of the main form that is opened when the DB is opened, but if the event handler is disconnected, that wont fire, either...p  pstrongEDITstrong Found the link to the source of the code Im using a hrefhttpwww.accessmvp.comdjsteeleAccessAA200403.zip relnofollowhttpwww.accessmvp.comdjsteeleAccessAA200403.zipap

Negative 72270 pI am working on a VBA script and I am stuck on something that should be so easy, but for some reason it is kicking my butt. Anyways, the VBA code takes a member number from sheet1, opens an authenticated IE window, pops in a member number, scrapes certain tables from the HTML page and inserts them into Sheet 2. Then it moves on to the next member number from Sheet1. However I am struggling getting the scraped data into sheet2. When I run the code everything goes according to plan, except that everything is just inserted into the same spot in sheet2 every time.

Negative 72270 pHi I accidentally deleted my android project and I am trying to rebuild the app by decompiling my apk file. The thing now is the generated class files have all the resource values shown in numberseg2130837504 instead of R.drawable.iclauncher. So to make it more readable, I need to find the actual resource and remap these values. But in the R.java all the values are displayed in Hexadecimal format which makes it hard when you have lot of resources. I could still find the value if I hover it on the name of the resource, but this process looks more tedious when there is lot of resources in the project.p  pSo is there a way to make eclipse display the actual value instead of hex value, so that it will make my work little easier.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com43HRj.png altenter image description herep  pSo I want eclipse to display as public static final int iclauncher2130837504p  pinstead of public static final int iclauncher0x7f020000p

Negative 72270 pmay i know how can i create a periodic timer callback on main thread using Firebreath plugin framework i tried FBTimergetTimer1, true, EventRunLoop on the StaticInitialize. i noticed my EventRunLoop function does not run on main thread when i debug into the created dll plugin and break point into EventRunLoop, VC express 2008 always indicate me that I was inside worker thread instead of main thread.p  pI understand that FBTimer is wrapper on boostasio. To create asyncwait using boost, I need the boostasioioservice io.run function to be put into the main thread. But I have no idea to how actively access the main thread of NPAPI or Firebreath because all the functions created is much of event base.p

Negative 72270 pDoes anyone know of a simple way to send commands to a selenium server over a web interface I am trying to automate the filling of several online forms each requiring a login but I dont want to do it from the local machine but rather a website so my employees can use it as well. This would save us time being that we currently fill out 810 different forms all with the same basic data. I have looked into form filling software but I really want this done by one server in the background. I dont think CURL would able to deal with the amount of DOM elements each website uses and some use those fancy ajax elements. I am pretty good at writing PHP, my original thinking was I could setup the selenium server with PHPunit and execute the scripts from any remote machine. I was sad to find this is still a command line only approach.p  pI appreciate any advice or technical info provided Of course, if anyone knows of a better solution than selenium for automating web form filling by a server I would appreciate that info as well.p

However, they do not appear in the context of the isotope UI and appear separately and cannot be sorted, laid out or filtered using Isotope.p  pHere is my JS Codep  precode    lt Define controller gt     var contrl  app.controllerMainController, functionscope         scope.items lstXYZ JSON data from server  Function called by button click         scope.addItem  functionitem                    scope.items.pushitem           scope.item                      contrl.inject  [scope] codepre  pHere is the HTML to display the server results...Updated to show working code..refer commentsp  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMainControllergt  ltdiv classisotope idisotopeContainergt       ltdiv ngrepeatitem in itemsgt                 ltdiv classelementitem item.status datacategoryitem.statusgt           ltp classnumbergtitem.typeltpgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pAnd here is my HTML button to add the new itemsp  precode  lttablegt     lttrgt       lttdgtltinput typetext ngmodelitem.status gtlttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt       lttdgtltinput typetext ngmodelitem.type gtlttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt       lttd colspan2gtltinput typeButton valueAdd ngclickaddItemitem gt lttdgt     lttrgt   lttablegt codepre  pI am not sure how do I ensure that Isotope can recognize the newly added element and reanimate the layout.p  pAny help or pointers will be very appreciated.

Negative 72270 pI am trying to implement a optional gift messaging form that is within our checkout page for an ecommerce site.  Our form has you standard shipping information but I would like to have it so if a customer starts filling out the fields for the gift message, all the fields that are required for the gift message would require validation.  I have 4 fieldsp  pgiftmessageto   enter information about who the gift is forp  pgiftmessagefrom   name of person from whom the gift is fromp  pgiftmessagemessage   their messagep  pgiftrecipientemail  an email will be sent out to the recipient notifying them that they will be receiving a gift.  This would use a regex expression and html5 to make sure it is a properly formatted email address.p  pI was thinking would create my own validation methodp  precode  def orderhasgiftmessagefield     orderhasgiftmessagefield  false     if self.giftmessagemessage.tos.size gt 0  self.giftmessageto.tos.size gt 0   self.giftmessagefrom.tos.size gt 0  self.giftrecipientemail.tos.size       orderhasgiftmessagefield  true     end     return orderhasgiftmessagefield   end codepre  pand validating itp  precodevalidate orderhasgiftmessagefield codepre  pSo if the user starts entering any of these fields, the other fields would also need to be filled out.  but if they do not enter any information, the validations would not be present. Has anyone done something similar to this  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. p
Negative 72270 pI am recently learning Fortran without any guidance, and experimenting with different versions. I have found from a hrefhttpwww.personal.psu.edujhmf90questionscommon.html relnofollowthis siteap  blockquote   pstrongIs a MODULE better than a COMMON blockstrongp      pAlmost always yes. The only reasons to use COMMON blocks are if you   expect to use your program on a computer with only a FORTRAN 77   compiler they still exist, or if it is very important that you   control the order in which your data is stored in memory.p blockquote  pWell, using modules is surely syntactically sweeter than using common blocks. But what are the differences in terms memory usage and allocation in both cases Also does it make a difference in terms performance and access speed Does that question make sensep

Negative 72270 pI am building a library to talk a third partys web service, which we connect to directly on an IP. The service is SSL secured, and we present a client certificate to identify us. The certificate they are presenting is self signed, I have the CA public key so that is fine, but their certificates CN is an email address so it isnt treated as valid.p  pIs there anyway to verify only that the certificate is signed by the CA Im using Ruby if thats helpful, although I guess its more an OpenSSL thing. The alternative is to not verify their certificate, but Id obviously rather not do that.p  pIn case you are wondering, asking them to change the certificate or add a hostname isnt an option. This is enterprise Dp

Negative 72270 pIve been having an issue with ApprovalTests recently where the diff tool BeyondCompare 3, in my case I have a coworker with the same issue using WinMerge is flashing open and then closes immediately.

Negative 72270 pAs the title suggests, the issue I am having is in setting up Eclipse for Android Development and testing.  There are two installations that need to be in sync.  There is the ADT and there is the SDK.  The problem I seem to be having stems from the fact that the latest version of the ADT is not compliant with what I need to do.

How do I get and use version 22 of the SDK for android development for Eclipsep

Negative 72270 pIm working on a project in Netbeans 8.0. Currently, the build process compiles all of the classes and assembles them into a JAR, as expected. That part works perfectly well and gives me the expected results.p  pWhat Id like to add to the project is the ability to also produce a second JAR meant to be used as a library, containing classes that are useful for making extensions to the primary project. Since all of the classes designated to be in the library are also in the primary JAR, the problem is simplified to essentially building a second JAR that contains a subset of the first one.p  pThe behavior I am trying to achieve is that after editing one or more source files, building the project will build both the primary executable JAR, as well as the secondary library JAR. I would prefer to avoid using a separate project.p  pIm pretty sure that this involves configuring the Ant build process, but Im having difficulty finding documentation on how to do so. If there is a good tutorial or guide on how the Ant process works and how to configure it, a link would be great Otherwise, is there a conventional method for configuring this sort of behaviorp  pThanksp

Negative 72270 pI need help on building an effective database. Im working on an app, but before I proceed, I need to complete my DB so that I can effectively integrate that. The issue is, Ive got 7 care homes and Im designing a menu app for it. Basically, the group uses 386 unique recipes. All the recipes the care homes cook are from these 386 recipes library. Also, they use a maximum of 75100386 unique recipes per home on a 4 week menu cycle. Every home has got a similar menu structure for the day. Breakfast, Lunch, snacks Dessert, Dinner, Drinks. It repeats every day of the week, every week of the month. Just the recipes differ from day to day and to week on a 4week cycle i.e. breakfastlunch recipes of week 1 are only repeated on week 5, week9 so on.  The more complex problem is, Lunch is a three course meal which has got 23 different options recipes for every course, similarly dinner and breakfast. The recipes can repeat within the week like breakfast on Sunday, Monday. Saturday can be same for week 1 or even week 234. But lunch options are unique within the week and in the cycle. Can anyone suggest me a better approach rather than manually entering every option in the table, which can be really exhaustive at its best I Can provide further informationdetails if required. p  pThanks...p

Negative 72270 pIve searched for this a bit on Stack, but I cannot find a definitive answer for https, only for solutions that somehow include http or unencrypted parameters which are not present in my situation.p  pI have developed an iOS application that communicates with MySQL via Apache HTTPS POSTS and php.p  pNow, the server runs with a valid certificate, is only open for traffic on port 443 and all posts are done to a hrefhttpsthedomain.netobscurefolderobscurefile.php relnofollowhttpsthedomain.netobscurefolderobscurefile.phpap  pIf someone knew the correct parameters to post, anyone from anywhere in the world could mess up the database completely, so the question is Is this method secure Let it be known nobody has access to the source code and none of the iPads that run this software are jailbreaked or otherwise compromised.p  pEdit in response to answers There are several php files which alone only support one specific operation and depend on very strict input formatting and correct license key retreived by SQL on every query. They do not respond to input at all unless its 100 correct and has a proper license e.g. password included. There is no actual website, only php files that respond to POSTs, given the correct input, as mentioned above. The webserver has been scanned by a third party security company and contains no known vulnerabilities.p

Negative 72270 pI have an arithmetic string that I want to parse to get the result. The best idea I have come up with so far is to convert the string to an array, but I am not sure what the correct and cross compatible way to do this is.p  pThe string I have to parse is 369310352 DampD damage rolls and resistance for an initiative tracker. To get a usable array, I need to split this by the operator of  or , but not lose the operator since I need to know which operation to perform.p  pIs there a way to do this in JavaScriptp  pThis is the array I hope to get back [3,6,9,3,10,3,5,2]p
Negative 72270 pI have a 3X3 grid pane. I need to move nodes between cells, or remove some nodes at say x,y position. In doing so I want the remaining nodes to get rearranged accordingly. Like if I remove the first node, the node at cell 0,1 should occupy 0,0 and so on..p  pI am doing this by DnD. Is there any way to auto arrange the cell nodes, rather than using custom logic on the drop event.p

Negative 72270 pI am running tor on a small OpenWRT router, where swapping cant be avoided due to the limited amount of ram available 32mb. p  pMost of the time the router doesnt do anything else, however from time to time a postgresql database also running on the router is accessed. Due to tor constantly running, postgresql is completly swapped out and the first few accesses have very high latency  which is bad because it is a interactively used system. Ive already assigned a nice value of 15 to postgres and 15 to tor, but it doesnt seem to affect memory management very much. Setting swappiness1 globally doesnt change things too, because swapping can not be avoided  and because postgresql isnt running most of the time, it is swapped out anyway.p  pIs there any way to assign something like a memory priority to a linux process I had a look at cgroup specific swappiness, however the only description I found was that it affects the decision pagecache vs swap. What I am looking for is a parameter to tell the linux kernel to not swap out postgresql as aggresivly as the other processes but I dont want to mlock the whole process. Or would assigning swappiness80 systemwide and swapiness1 for postgresql have the effect I hope for  keeping postgresql in memory while swpping out everything else when requiredp  pThank you in advance, Clemens p
Negative 72270 pWhat is the best way to deal with fields that change frequently inside a document for ElasticSearch Per their a hrefhttpwww.elasticsearch.orgguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentpartialupdates.html relnofollowdocs about partial updatesa...p  blockquote   pInternally, however, the update API simply manages the same retrievechangereindex process that we have already described.p blockquote  pIn particular, what should be done when the indexing of the document will likely be expensive given the number of indexed field and the size of some of the text fields that have to be analyzedp  pAs a concrete example, use SOs view and vote counts on questions and answers.

Negative 72270 pI think my first submission might have been a bit confusing so I decided to rewrite it to better explain what I am attempting to do.p  pI have an Access database.  In it there are two combo boxes, one containing all possible forms of annuity that Im dealing with and the other combo box is the ones the user populates that apply to that particular client.  This master list is fed from a table tblPickAnnuityForms.  This table has 3 fields, Name, VarName these values match to another table, and Deleted is a 1 or a 0 depending on if the user selected it.  I also have a second table called tblPlanSpecs.  This table, among other fields, has the fields that match up to the VarName field in the first table.p  pWhat I need to do, since tblPickAnnuityForms is basically a temporary table and it changes as you move between records clients, is to repopulate it when you go to that record based on the values in tblPlanSpecs.  Once tblPickAnnuityForms is populated based on the previous elections for this record client, the two combo boxes are requeried to display the proper values ie the left box shows the remaining, unused annuity forms and the right box shows the forms that apply to this client.  p  pBelow is my attempt at doing this.  p  precodeDim db As DAO.Database Dim rsList As DAO.Recordset Dim rsData As DAO.Recordset Dim CurrForm As String Dim FormVal As Integer Dim Plan As String  Set db  CurrentDb Set rsList  db.OpenRecordsettblPickAnnuityForms, dbOpenSnapshot      Plan  [Forms][FrmHome][PlanNameCalc].Value  Set rsData  db.OpenRecordsetSELECT tblPlanSpecs.LifeAnnuity, tblPlanSpecs.FiveCC, tblPlanSpecs.TenCC,       amp tblPlanSpecs.FifteenCC, tblPlanSpecs.TwentyCC, tblPlanSpecs.FiveCertain, tblPlanSpecs.TenCertain,       amp tblPlanSpecs.FifteenCertain, tblPlanSpecs.TwentyCertain, tblPlanSpecs.FiftyJS, tblPlanSpecs.SixtySixJS,       amp tblPlanSpecs.SeventyFiveJS, tblPlanSpecs.HundredJS, tblPlanSpecs.MCR FROM tblPlanSpecs       amp WHERE tblPlanSpecs.PlanName amp Plan amp   Do      CurrForm  rsList.FieldsVarName     FormVal  rsData.FieldsCurrForm      DoCmd.RunSQL UPDATE tblPickAnnuityForms           amp SET tblPickAnnuityForms.Deleted amp rsData amp FormVal amp            amp WHERE tblPickAnnuityForms.VarName amp CurrForm amp       MsgBox CurrForm amp changed to  amp FormVal      rsList.MoveNext  Loop Until rsList.EOF  If Not rsList Is Nothing Then     rsList.CLOSE     Set rsList  Nothing End If codepre  pIf there is a better solution, perhaps I can go in a different direction.  Currently this is bombing out in the loop where it says rsData amp FormVal   It does not like using a variable to call a field.  Ideally I would like to avoid specifically calling every variable by name in code when populating rsData.  In other words, I want this to work no matter how many other options I add to my master list for the combo box, without going back in to add more items to select query.p  pPlease let me know if I am unclear in my intended direction or methods.  I could really use the help figuring out what is wrong.p

Negative 72270 pIm very confused about this question in C.p  pif codea[i]code is equivalent to codeaicode. What is the equivalent of codea[j][i]codep  pI know the codeaicode is incrementing the memory address of the first element of the array by the value of i and then using the  operator to dereference that address to obtain the value. However, I am confused about multidimensional arrays. In memory, the values are stored just like a single dimensional array but I dont understand how I can increment the memory address by using the variable i or j like in the single dimensional array example. p  pfor some reason printing codeacode in single dimensional array will print the first element of the array whereas codeacode in a multidimensional array will print a random number. Why is this so  p  pAny help is greatly appreciated. p

Negative 72270 pI am on a managed system where I do not have access to the system variables whereby I can adjust the PATH variable directly. I have use a .bat file with codesetx path CUsersmePortableAppsruby1.9.3bincode on startup to modify my path for use when I open up a codeCMDcode window. This worked for my RubySASS installation inside of codeCMDcode.p  pWhen Sublime Text 3 makes a call to codeCMDcode I get codesass is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.code. Further the path is displayed and it distinctly lacks CUsersmePortableAppsruby1.9.3bin. If I open up a codeCMDcode session and echo the PATH, the PATH is fully intact to include the CUsersmePortableAppsruby1.9.3bin.p  pIs there a means that I can ensure that ST3 reads the modified path as established by the call to codesetx How is ST3 accessing the path that differs fromcodeCMDcode The error seems to show that ST3 is callingcodeCMD directly Would it not access the same application and system variables as I do HowWhy does it get the System Variable for PATH and not the user Can this be changedp

I read in another answer on Stack Overflow that browser does not care about the ContentType header. It only matters at the application level so that application can detect and decode response properly.p  pSo I am wondering that there should be a way to set this response header before the response is parsed by Javascript. I know for sure that if this header is set then the response is being parsed properly otherwise it garbles some of the characters.p  pCurrently I am using vanilla Javascript i.e. XMLHttpRequest for making this call so it will great if someone can tell me how to achieve this using with only vanilla Javascript. Although I can switch to using JQuery also if required.p

All other processes cannot read from other sessions controlling terminal. So no one can read from the terminal, vhangup not needed.p  pPlease correct where I am wrong.p

If the errors dont fit into the codeTextcode with the full height, a scroll bar should be shown. p  pHeres a minimized snippet of what I reached till nowp  precodepackage de.dannylo.issues   import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  import org.eclipse.core.runtime.IStatus import org.eclipse.core.runtime.Status import org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.MessageDialog import org.eclipse.jface.wizard.Wizard import org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog import org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardPage import org.eclipse.swt.SWT import org.eclipse.swt.custom.StackLayout import org.eclipse.swt.events.ModifyEvent import org.eclipse.swt.events.ModifyListener import org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Point import org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Rectangle import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridData import org.eclipse.swt.layout.GridLayout import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Event import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Listener import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Text   public class TestWizardPage     extends WizardPage      private static final String PLUGINID  de.dannylo.issues.TestPlugin      private Composite mainComposite      private Composite stackComposite      private StackLayout stackLayout      private Composite defaultMessageComposite      private Text idText      private static Wizard wizard      public TestWizardPage              superportalAppWizardMavenPage         setTitleTestWizard         setDescriptionTesting...

In this case the height of the codeTextcode is maximum and the codebottomLabelcode should be shown. Unfortunately this label doesnt appear as its composite appears, but rather it appears only after the width of the window changes. It seems to be some problem with layouting. I already tried to use codeerrorComposite.layouttrue, truecode and even codegetShell.layouttrue, truecode to flush the cache and redraw the children but this didnt help. Any ideas on how to fix that issuep

Negative 72270 pI have an unbound form used to enter constituent data. I cant use subforms because data is spread across multiple tables and linked with foreign keys. Since I want to use the field validation rules to validate, I use a transaction to make sure new records are committed in an allornothing fashion. I dont want names committed without addresses, etc.p  pThe form is designed to iterate over a recordset, tempImportRs, to give the user an opportunity to make sure the data looks OK and to manually correct or skip invalid entries. It works by populating the forms fields with values from tempImportRs for each entry. Theres also a subform that searches for similar records and displays them to the user to decide if this is really a new person or if they already exist in the DB with somewhat different info.p  pI am running into a problem using this tempImportRs recordset, which persists for the lifetime of the form and is used by various methods in the form, alongside Accesss transactions which I dont understand very well, admittedly. If at any point I close the transaction likep  precodeWrkSp.Close codepre  pthen my tempImportRs object will disappear and give me Requires object type errors.

Negative 72270 pI have a question in algorithm design about arrays, which should be implement in C language. Suppose that we have an array which has n elements. For simplicity n is power of 2 like code1, 2, 4, 8, 16 , etccode. I want to separate this to 2 parts with coden2code elements. Condition of separating is codelowest absolute difference between sum of all elements in two arrayscode for example if I have this array code9,2,5,3,6,1,4,7code it will be separate to these arrays code9,5,1,3code and code6,7,4,2code . summation of first arrays elements is code18code and the summation of second arrays elements is code19code and the difference is 1 and these two arrays are the answer but two arrays like code9,5,4,2code and code7,6,3,1code isnt the answer because the difference of element summation is code4code and we have found code1code . so code4code isnt the minimum difference. How to solve this Thank you.p

Negative 72270 pHere is the scenario. I have a class, called strongBaseClassstrong and 6 class which extend this class strongDerivedClass1strong to strongDerivedCLass6strong. BaseClass has, lets say, 500 variables and not all of them are needed for all of the DerivedClass[1..6]. Yes, this is really bad and thats what I am trying to fix. The problem is that since polymorphism is used, after creating an instance of DerivedClass[1..6], it is assigned to a BaseClass reference. And every method call happens on this reference. So doing a Find all references is not very effective. Also, the code base is huge.p  pI need to figure out what common variables are used by these 6 derived classes and retain them in the BaseClass and move the remaining specific variables to their respective classes the way it was supposed to be done to begin with. p  pTrying to manually trace each variable and figure out the control flow and logic is quite cumbersome. I was hoping someone had some better ideas.p  p UPDATE p  pIll explain with an example.p  precodepublic class BaseClass      private String common1     ...     private String common6      private String var1     ...     private String var60      getters and setters follow   public class DerivedClass1 extends BaseClass      private String 1a     private String 1b     ...     getters and setters  codepre  p...p  precodepublic class DerivedClass6 extends BaseClass      private String 6a     private String 6b     ...     getters and setters  codepre  pThe BaseCLass variables common1 to common6 are used by all derived classes.p  pDerivedClass1 uses var1 to var10p  pDerivedClass2 uses var11 to var20p  p...p  pDerivedClass6 uses var51 to var60p  pWhat I want to do is figure out common1 to common6 and retain them in BaseClass. And move the specific derived class variables to their respective classes. And these are POJOs, so there are no other methods apart from getters and setters.p  pThe way these are used is the specific derived class object is created and assigned to base class reference. And methods are invoked on the base class reference. And the base class reference is used everywhere. In some situations, the object is retrieved from a hashmap based on an id and assigned to the base class reference. Even if I try to follow the code, I wont know what type of object is being used in that scenario. p  pI hope this makes sense.p

Negative 72270 pWe have created a twocolumn HTML table on a user profile page generated by a web framework Rails 4.2.x that allows users the ability to dynamically add rows to the table by clicking an add row button. Everything is working as designed. The two columns consist of two select tag dropdowns, username and userlunch, an example of which is here p  precodelttable iduserlunchtablegt lttrgt     ltthgtUserltthgt     ltthgtLunchltthgt lttrgt lttbody iduserlunchtablebodygt     lttr classnestedfieldsgt         lttdgtlt f.select username, usernames gtlttdgt         lttdgtlt f.select userlunch, userlunch1 gtlttdgt     lttrgt  lttbodygt  codepre  pThe variable usernames consists of [ jim, ted ], the variable userlunch1 consists of [ chicken, steak, fish ], and the variable userlunch2 consists of [ salad, tofu ]. p  pDue to the dynamic nature of the table users can add rows at will, the framework automatically inserts an rowspecific integer beginning with 0 into the ID of each td within the table. For example, inspecting the table with Firebug indicates the ID assigned to the name column on the first row is profileattributes0username, the ID assigned to the same column in the next row down is profileattributes1username, the next row down is profileattributes2username, and so forth. p  pWe have been researching for some time as to how to utilize jQuery to detect a change to the username select tag the Name column in a given row and, on change, alter the options for select in the next column over userlunch, the Lunch column. In this case, the options for select of the Lunch column are set to the userlunch1. When the username dropdown is changed from jim to ted in a given row, we would like that rows userlunch column to change the options for select from userlunch1 to userlunch2. p  pGiven the dynamic  ID assignment, the first issue is detecting the username select tag change using jQuery and identifying the row on which the change occurred. Normally if td IDs were static we would detect the change via something like the following please note that Rails 4.2 defaults to CoffeeScript formatting providing a solution in standard JS formatting is perfectly acceptablep  precodedocument.ready gt     profileattributes0username.changegt  codepre  pHowever, as the IDs are dynamic, we need the ability to determine the change using wildcards or regex. p  pTherefore, we need to detect a .change for any td ID that contains both profileattributes and username. Then, we need to determine the value 0, 1, 2, etc between profileattributes and username to identify the row. Finally, we need to alter the corresponding userlunch column on that same row, replacing the options for select from userlunch1 to userlunch2.p  pThank you in advance for assistance. p

Negative 72270 pIm building a tool that lists files in a directory.  When you hover over each file it shows a tooltip displaying the date and who made the file.  Id also like an image to accompany this data.  p  pIs it possible to insert an image into a tooltip  For each item in the QTreeView Id like a specific image and text to popup.  If it cant be done with  tooltips are there other alternativesp  precodefrom PySide import QtCore, QtGui from shiboken import wrapInstance import maya.OpenMayaUI as mui  def getparent     ptr

Negative 72270 pRe editing... this question has NOT been answered beforep  pI had understood that changing the contents of a current page with window.location replaced the cached version of the original page  from the last history, so that you really couldnt go back with the browser BACK button. I had even seen this posted as a solution to preventing a malicious visitor from using the BACK button to to resubmit a mail form many times. But it is NOT workable because in the case of a mail form, the BACK button will just take the user back to the prePOST version of the page. p  pSo, I can use javascript to reset the form, disable the SUBMIT button, change to another page after success, or do whatever I want to the page. But its all for nothing if a simple click of the BACK button followed by SUBMIT causes the form to post again with just 2 clicks.p  pI know there are a lot of solutions to preventing malicious form resubmissions I can try, but Ive had trouble getting them to work, and so Id just like to know if removing the last history is a dead end. If there is a way, and it is pretty cross browser friendly, then I can just make it part of my scripted actions once my form is successfully processed, and my thank you page displays. Basically Id want my thank you pages onload event to either erase the last history, or in a browser compatible way disable the BACK buttonp  pFor what its worth, Ive included code from simple test Ive been working with. You can put some junk in the fields and hit submit. The vars are cleared in the PHP, the form fields are force cleared in javascript, and a new location is invoked. Unfortunately, hitting BACK button will take you back to the preposted form, with all the strings you added still intact. p  precode   ltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegt Form Behavior Testlttitlegt   ltheadgt   lt ltphp   name  email  comments    formDone  false   if SERVER[REQUESTMETHOD]  POST           formDone  true     name  email  comments         gt gt  ltbody gt   lttable border1gtlttrgtlttd style textalignright width100gt  ltform namecontactform idcontactform methodpost enctypemultipartformdata actionltphp echo htmlspecialcharsSERVER[PHPSELF]gtgt   Name  ltinput typetext namename idname valueltphp echo namegtgtltbrgt Email ltinput typetext nameemail idemailvalueltphp echo emailgtgtltbrgt ltbrgt ltdiv aligncentergt  ltspan classerrorgtltspangt Message  ltbrgt lttextarea namecomments idcomments wrapphysical cols40 rows10  gtltphp echo commentsgtlttextareagt ltdivgt  ltinput namesubmit idsubmit typesubmit valueSubmit gt ltformgt  lttdgtlttrgtlttablegt   ltscript languageJavaScriptgt  if lt echo formDone  true  true  false gt       document.getElementByIdname.value       document.getElementByIdemail.value       document.getElementByIdcomments.value       document.getElementByIdsubmit.valueDisabled     document.getElementByIdsubmit.disabledtrue           substitute with a thank you page     window.location  httpgoogle.com    ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 72270 pI am having couple of EBS Volumes and I have a cron which I would use to create snapshots from the volumes that are close to 1TB, the entire backup snapshot runs for nearly 5 to 6 hours. I understand that the single biggest factor which effects the delay is due to magnitude of the data changes from the previous backupdelta of data change. To prove that point, the snapshots are much faster if I try to take the snapshot again immediately after a successful backup.p  pCurrently the Volumes are Magnetic, what are the ways to speed up the backup process. Will Changing those to SSD or Provisioned SSD help improve backup running time p

Negative 72270 pI am struggling a bit to set up a working structure in one of my projects. The problem is, that I have main package and a subpackage in a structure like this I left out all unnecessary filesp  precodecode.py mypackageinit.py mypackagework.py mypackageutils.py codepre  pThe utils.py has some utility code that is normally only used in the mypackage package.p  pI normally have some test code each module file, that calls some methods of the current module and prints some things to quickcheck if everything is working correctly. This code is placed in a codeif name  maincode block at the end of the file. So I include the utils.py directly via codeimport utilscode. E.g mypackagework.py looks like p  precodeimport utils  def someMethod     pass  if name  main     printsomeMethod codepre  pBut now when I use this module in the parent package e.g. code.py and I import it like thisp  precodeimport mypackage.work codepre  pI get the following errorp  precodeImportError No module named utils codepre  pAfter some research I found out, that this can be fixed by adding the codemypackagecode folder to the PYTHONPATH environment variable, but this feels strange for me. Isnt there any other way to fix this I have heard about relative imports, but this is mentioned in the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3.5tutorialmodules.html relnofollowpython docs about modulesa p  blockquote   pNote that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always strongmainstrong, modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.p blockquote  pAny suggestions how I can have a codeif name  maincode section in the submodule and also can use this file from the parent package without messing up the importsp  pstrongEDITstrong If I use a relative import in codework.pycode as suggested in a answer to import utilsp  precodefrom . import utils codepre  pI get the following errorp  precodeSystemError Parent module  not loaded, cannot perform relative import codepre

Negative 72270 pI have a setup where we package source code into nuget packages through Team City to be deployed through Octopus deploy. The size of the folder that is packaged is 267MB.

Negative 72270 pI have an array of elements. I am making object on the basis of each elements name and call some getter functions.

Negative 72270 pSo Im getting a bit stumped by this one. Ive got multiple pages making lots of successful Ajax calls to my C controllers on the back end with a variety of data, but now Im trying to build a simple little content management functionality, and hence update the HTML in a database with new HTML from a JS editor.p  pLong story short, Ive taken out all the heavy Database code and narrowed it down to the fact that either my controller wont accept anything with html tags, or my ajax code is having trouble sending it.p  pThe Ajax function isp  precode.ajax             type POST,             url Url.ActionUpdateContent, Admin,             data                  elementId elementId,                 newContent newContent             ,             dataType json,             success function data                  if data.result  true                      infoMessageContent Updated, success                  else                      infoMessageError   data.result  . Nothing has been updated, error                              ,             error function                   alertThere was a problem contacting the server.                       codepre  pAnd on my Controller side, Ive taken away all the code to just leave some debugging write lines.p  precode[HttpPost]     public ActionResult UpdateContentstring elementId, string newContent              System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine  elementId         System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine  newContent         string result  true         return Jsonnew  result  result       codepre  pNow the interesting thing is that when I have codenewContentcode in the codedatacode paramater in the Ajax request set to anything like codeltpgthelloltpgtcode those writelines dont even get called and the whole ajax call fails. Yet when I just use a normal string e.g. codehellocode it works fine. Ive further narrowed it down to just the opening html bracket, so even codeltpcode would fail.p  pWith this in mind, what is happening here And secondly, what is the correct way to send html back to the controller via Ajax so this doesnt happenp
