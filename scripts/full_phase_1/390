Positive 390 pMy question is about permissions and ownership settings for my custom shell scripts and the custom shell script directory itself. This is only for security on my personal machine, but Id like to know best practices for any situation.p  pMy script directory is usrlocalscriptsp  ul lipShould I give myself write privileges to my own scripts Or should root be the only onepli lipShould everyone else have readonly permissionpli lipShould root have ownership over any of my scriptsdirectorypli ul  pIm still learning UNIX permissions, so trying to wrap my head around the implications of certain files having certain permissions still eludes me to an extent. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 390 pIm trying get LibJPEGturbos executable cjpeg.exe a hrefhttpwww.libjpegturbo.org relnofollowhttpwww.libjpegturbo.orga with Windows official binaries to work inside a DLL Im creating to handle batch processing of large images.  Im using Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.  The reason for using this vs .NETs jpeg encoderdecoder is vastly greater quality and speed is essential, and other libraries such as BitMiracles .NET JPEG library is tremendously slow even after I added some unsafe code to speed up sections of the library, such as reading in the bitmap data.p  pMy first attempt at using cjpeg.exe was to use the Process class stream redirectionp  precodeProcessStartInfo pi  new ProcessStartInfo pi.FileName  CUsersspl3001DocumentsVisual Studio 2010ProjectsTurboJpegTurboJpegcjpeg.exe pi.RedirectStandardOutput  true pi.RedirectStandardInput  false pi.RedirectStandardError  true pi.UseShellExecute  false pi.CreateNoWindow  true pi.Arguments   quality   quality.ToString     inFile   codepre  pAnd then using this code to write the data out to a filep  precodeProcess proc  new Process proc.StartInfo  pi  proc.Start  string data  proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd StreamWriter sw  new StreamWriteroutFile sw.Writedata sw.Close  proc.WaitForExit codepre  pWhat I get is a JPEG file, with some jpeg data inside, but the header isnt quite correct both from a hex editor ASCII viewp  precode..JFIF.. codepre  pinstead ofp  precode..JFIF...... codepre  pwhich is what is created when cjpeg.exe is run on the sample data Ive created via normal shell use typing it in cmd shell.  The first incorrect file wont load in any viewer software, while the second one works perfectly.p  pI think it has to do with the StandardOutput stream being read out as a string and some UTF8 treatment of the data when writing it out as a file.  Also, the output file created by the code at the top is larger than if done by hand.p  pMy next attempt was to turn off all the redirection and have in the argument the shell standard output redirection operator  outputfile as is the recommended use of cjpeg.exe.  This just throws up an error saying that cjpeg is receiving too many input files.p  pHowever, if I copy the the argument string out EXACTLY as it is run inside the program and run it by hand, it works correctly.p  pAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 390 pIve been working on a visualization project for 2dimensional continuous data. Its the kind of thing you could use to study elevation data or temperature patterns on a 2D map. At its core, its really a way of flattening 3dimensions into twodimensionspluscolor. In my particular field of study, Im not actually working with geographical elevation data, but its a good metaphor, so Ill stick with it throughout this post.p  pAnyhow, at this point, I have a continuous color renderer that Im very pleased withp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comycIzY.png altContinuous Color Rendererp  pThe gradient is the standard colorwheel, where red pixels indicate coordinates with high values, and violet pixels indicate low values.p  pThe underlying data structure uses some very clever if I do say so myself interpolation algorithms to enable arbitrarily deep zooming into the details of the map.p  pAt this point, I want to draw some topographical contour lines using quadratic bezier curves, but I havent been able to find any good literature describing efficient algorithms for finding those curves.p  pTo give you an idea for what Im thinking about, heres a poormans implementation where the renderer just uses a black RGB value whenever it encounters a pixel that intersects a contour linep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeOiGk.png altContinuous Color with Ghetto Topo Linesp  pThere are several problems with this approach, thoughp  ul lipAreas of the graph with a steeper slope result in thinner and often broken topo lines. Ideally, all topo lines should be continuous.pli lipAreas of the graph with a flatter slope result in wider topo lines and often entire regions of blackness, especially at the outer perimeter of the rendering region.pli ul  pSo Im looking at a vectordrawing approach for getting those nice, perfect 1pixelthick curves. The basic structure of the algorithm will have to include these stepsp  ol lipAt each discreet elevation where I want to draw a topo line, find a set of coordinates where the elevation at that coordinate is extremely close given an arbitrary epsilon value to the desired elevation.pli lipEliminate redundant points. For example, if three points are in a perfectlystraight line, then the center point is redundant, since it can be eliminated without changing the shape of the curve. Likewise, with bezier curves, it is often possible to eliminate cetain anchor points by adjusting the position of adjacent control points.pli lipAssemble the remaining points into a sequence, such that each segment between two points approximates an elevationneutral trajectory, and such that no two line segments ever cross paths. Each pointsequence must either create a closed polygon, or must intersect the bounding box of the rendering region.pli lipFor each vertex, find a pair of control points such that the resultant curve exhibits a minimum error, with respect to the redundant points eliminated in step 2.pli lipEnsure that all features of the topography visible at the current rendering scale are represented by appropriate topo lines. For example, if the data contains a spike with high altitude, but with extremely small diameter, the topo lines should still be drawn. Vertical features should only be ignored if their feature diameter is smaller than the overall rendering granularity of the image.pli ol  pBut even under those constraints, I can still think of several different heuristics for finding the linesp  ul lipFind the highpoint within the rendering boundingbox. From that high point, travel downhill along several different trajectories. Any time the traversal line crossest an elevation threshold, add that point to an elevationspecific bucket. When the traversal path reaches a local minimum, change course and travel uphill.pli lipPerform a highresolution traversal along the rectangular boundingbox of the rendering region. At each elevation threshold and at inflection points, wherever the slope reverses direction, add those points to an elevationspecific bucket. After finishing the boundary traversal, start tracing inward from the boundary points in those buckets.pli lipScan the entire rendering region, taking an elevation measurement at a sparse regular interval. For each measurement, use its proximity to an elevation threshold as a mechanism to decide whether or not to take an interpolated measurement of its neighbors. Using this technique would provide better guarantees of coverage across the whole rendering region, but itd be difficult to assemble the resultant points into a sensible order for constructing paths.pli ul  pSo, those are some of my thoughts...p  pBefore diving deep into an implementation, I wanted to see whether anyone else on StackOverflow has experience with this sort of problem and could provide pointers for an accurate and efficient implementation.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIm especially interested in the Gradient suggestion made by ellisbben. And my core data structure ignoring some of the optimizing interpolation shortcuts can be represented as the summation of a set of 2D gaussian functions, which is totally differentiable.p  pI suppose Ill need a data structure to represent a threedimensional slope, and a function for calculating that slope vector for at arbitrary point. Off the top of my head, I dont know how to do that though it seems like it ought to be easy, but if you have a link explaining the math, Id be much obligedp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks to the excellent contributions by ellisbben and Azim, I can now calculate the contour angle for any arbitrary point in the field. Drawing the real topo lines will follow shortlyp  pHere are updated renderings, with and without the ghetto rasterbased toporenderer that Ive been using. Each image includes a thousand random sample points, represented by red dots. The angleofcontour at that point is represented by a white line. In certain cases, no slope could be measured at the given point based on the granularity of interpolation, so the red dot occurs without a corresponding angleofcontour line.p  pEnjoyp  pemNOTE These renderings use a different surface topography than the previous renderings  since I randomly generate the data structures on each iteration, while Im prototyping  but the core rendering method is the same, so Im sure you get the idea.emp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPovID.png altalt textp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comx7jpg.png altalt textp  pHeres a fun fact over on the righthandside of these renderings, youll see a bunch of weird contour lines at perfect horizontal and vertical angles. These are artifacts of the interpolation process, which uses a grid of interpolators to reduce the number of computations by about 500 necessary to perform the core rendering operations. All of those weird contour lines occur on the boundary between two interpolator grid cells.p  pLuckily, those artifacts dont actually matter. Although the artifacts are detectable during slope calculation, the final renderer wont notice them, since it operates at a different bit depth.p  hr  pUPDATE AGAINp  pAaaaaaaand, as one final indulgence before I go to sleep, heres another pair of renderings, one in the oldschool continuous color style, and one with 20,000 gradient samples. In this set of renderings, Ive eliminated the red dot for pointsamples, since it unnecessarily clutters the image.p  pHere, you can really see those interpolation artifacts that I referred to earlier, thanks to the gridstructure of the interpolator collection. I should emphasize that those artifacts will be completely invisible on the final contour rendering since the difference in magnitude between any two adjacent interpolator cells is less than the bit depth of the rendered image.p  pBon appetitp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRU3Yl.png altalt textp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6RWTM.png altalt textp

And for values a,b,c lt 232 you could compute the intermediate values in 64 bit long ints and use built in  operators to reduce to the right answep  pBut Ive been told that there are special tricks for efficiently computing ab mod C when C is of the form  2N1  or 2N1, that dont use 64 bit math or a BigInt library and are quite efficient, more so than an arbitrary modulus evaluation, and also properly compute cases which would normally overflow a 32 bit int if you were including the intermediate multiplication.p  pUnfortunately, despite hearing that such special cases have a fast evaluation method, I havent actually found a description of the method.

Negative 390 pOne of the memory leaks Ive discovered in our application is the codejava.awt.Window.allWindowscode private static field, which keeps track of every Window instantiated.  We have dialog boxes that are created, used, and then forgotten, and the expectation was that these would go away and be garbage collected.  This private field keeps them in scope, indefinitely, until the codedisposecode method is called on them.  And by definition, we cant do that when theyve gone out of scope.p  pI dont understand why this is designed this way.  It seems contrary to the spirit of garbage collection to have to explicitly let the system know when Im done with a Window object.  Obviously Im done with it, as it is out of scope.p  pI understand what the codedisposecode method is doing getting rid of system peer objects.  I do understand that this is outside of Java and that you need some way to do that and that Swing shouldnt just lose track of those objects, or else it would have a memory leak.  But what is accomplished by keeping a reference to my Window around forever, when I am never going to use it againp  pCan someone explain why this is necessaryp

Negative 390 pMy situation involves a directory containing MP3 files, and a database that should contain all the MP3 metadata i.e. genres, artist names, album names, and track names from the MP3 files in that directory. The database should always reflect what is in the directory, that is... the algorithm Im searching for should never delete items from the directory, only from database. The directory is the original, the database should be the exact copy of the directory after the program is run, and the directory should remain untouched by the program.p  pFrom my understanding, I believe I would have to loop over the contents of the directory inserting records in the database when I come across MP3 metadata that is found in the directory but isnt found in the database. Then, loop over the contents of the database and delete from the database what isnt found in the directory.p  pIs there a general algorithm for synchronizing two things such as a directory and a database Is there a better way to do this than what Ive outlinedp  pIm trying to complete this task using Ruby Sequel and MySQL, in case that matters.p  pJust to clarify, assume all MP3 tag data is correct. I run all files through an automatic MP3 tagger and make sure everything is accurately tagged before moving it to this directory.p  pMy preferred solution would be by running a Ruby script manually, rather than with Cron for example. My reasons being because it is the language I am already using to implement most of this project, and I must manually tag all MP3 files and verify they are correct, so I dont want any scripts to be ran until I can verify that all files in my MP3 directory are good to go.p

Negative 390 pSpeed, optimization, and scalability are the typical comparisons between the Udp and Tcp protocols. Tcp touts reliability with the disadvantage of a little extra overhead, but speed is good to excellent. Once a Tcp socket is instanced, keeping the socket open requires emsomeem overhead. But compared to the oft described burdens of Udp, which protocol actually has more overhead. Ive also heard that there are scalability issues with Tcp...yet the Internet Web pagesservers runs on Tcp  so what is it about Tcp that inhibits scalability  p  pOkay...so Udp doesnt require that overhead of keeping a connection open. But, it requires that you write extra methods to ensure all of the packet gets there, hopefully in the order that you want it received. If a packet isnt received in full, then you have to tell the client or server to resend. And you also have to keep some sort of message collection for partial packets, rebuild the partial messages, and check for a complete message before the message can finally be processed. Not to mention if the second part of a message never makes it, you have to either say resend the entire thing, or resend the part we are missing, or whatever.  p  pBasically, my questions are  p  ol liWhy would I choose Udp over Tcp for a serious, highperformance server with the added overhead of message checking and manual ACK versus the overhead of a continuous stream  li liIf Tcp is good enough for the likes of World of Warcraft, why isnt Tcp more widely accepted as emtheem protocol to use for a game serverli ol  pNote I am not opposed to implementing Udp options for a server. We are using C on .Net 3.5 framework. So I would also be interested in the best practices for dealing with Udp emburdensem. I am also using the asynchronous methods at the emsocketem level rather than using TcpListener, TcpClient, etc. etc.p

Negative 390 pThe company I work for now uses a set naming convention for their C variables such as iSomeName for int, sSomeName for string, aSomeName for arrays, bSomeName for boolean, dSomeName for datetime and so on.  My previous employer did not use the i, s, a, b and d prefixes and just named the variables a good understandable name.

Negative 390 pWe have been using the usual code to read in a complete file into a string to then parse in VB6. The files are ANSI text but encoded using whatever code page the user was in at the time we have Chinese and English users for example. This is the codep  precodeOpen FileName For Binary As nFileUnit sContents  StrConvInputBLOFnFileUnit, nFileUnit, vbUnicode codepre  pHowever, we have discovered this is VERY slow reading a file from a server running unixlinux, particularly when the ownership of the file is not the same as the process doing the reading. p  pI have rewritten the above using Get and discovered it is much faster and does not suffer from any issues with file ownership. I appreciate that this might be solved by reconfiguring the server somehow, but I think since deiscovering even without that issue, the Get method is still much faster than InputB Id like to replace my existing code using Get.p  pI wonder if someone could tell me if this will really do the same thing. In particular, is it correctly doing the ANSI to Unicode conversion and will this always be true. My testing suggests the following replacement code does the same thing but fasterp  precode  Open FileName For Binary As nFileUnit   sContents  StringLOFnFileUnit,     Get nFileUnit, , sContents codepre  pI also realise I could use a byte array, but again my tests suggest the above is simpler and works.

Negative 390 pIm looking for a workitemtrackingbugtracking system or JIRA plugin, or TFS plugin, or... which makes it easy to stackrank work items without having to manually assign priority values to each work item.  p  pInstead, our team wants to be able to see a list of open work items and be able to dragndrop one or a multiple selection of work items until the order matches the teams prioritization.  This would be much easier than arguing about priority numbers and dealing with ties e.g. which of the 5 bugs marked priority2 should I work on today. p  pOur team is considering switching workitemtrackers we use a hrefhttpwww.geminiplatform.com relnofollowGeminia now and availability of a good dragndrop prioritizer is high on our requirements list. p  pI realize dragndrop ranking is nontrivial because no team will stack rank emallem work items. Instead, well want to take a subset e.g. work items for one sprint sprint or iteration, or bugs assigned to one developer and stackrank those, then later look at a different subset and stackrank those, etc.  And Im sure well sometimes need to mix and match different stacks, so thered need to be heuristics ideally configurable about how to show a stack of items previously stacked separately. p  pa hrefhttpswww.pivotaltracker.com relnofollowPivotal Trackera is close to the dragndrop UI Im thinking of from a UI perspective, but Pivotals model of separating user stories from the underlying work items plus a few other issues doesnt match how we want to work.  We dont want to have to deal with different artifacts stories vs. JIRABugZilla work items instead we just want a dragndrop UI to automatically fill out a priority field in the issue tracker, and which we can use later when sorting and filtering.  And we wouldnt want to use Pivotal as our only work item tracker, because it seems to lack common features like bulk editing which are critical for large projects. p  pAnyone know of a tool like what I describe abovep

Negative 390 pI have a large number that loops from 0 to 65535 I chose 16 bits simply to have a nice cutting off point. Im incrementing an int, and theres an if statement that checks if the int is 65536. If it is, it sets the int to 0 a little kludgy, but it works. I know it would be much more efficient to just use a short int and let it overflow, but I initially didnt do that because a short is not guaranteed to be 2 bytes, its just fairly likely.p  pThis is C code running on a linux ubuntu machine. If I were to use a short and later decided to run this program on another OS or say, run it on a 64bit machine, since Im testing on a 32bit one now, is there a pretty good chance that my short will still be 2 bytes I can easily test it on a few different machines, but some of the people here have worked with a LOT of computers.

Negative 390 pIm trying to find a way to send a MMS message containing a strongvCard attachmentstrong. I thought this would be a fairly easy task, but I still havent managed to come up with something that just works over a wide variety of Android phones.p  pThe first thing I tried was this p  pstrongDefine an intent showing a list of apps capable of sending the vCardstrongp  precodeIntent i  new IntentIntent.ACTIONSEND i.setTypetextxvcard i.putExtraIntent.EXTRATEXT,MMS with vCard i.putExtraIntent.EXTRASTREAM, Uri.parse someFilereference startActivityIntent.createChooseri, Select MMS application. codepre  pWhen using this, I noticed the following p  ul liOn a strongSamsung Galaxy Sstrong, the chooser allowed me to pick Bluetooth,Gmail strongand the Messaging appstrong. When using the Messaging app, the attachment and text was present, and I could send the MMS. I processed the MMS on an old Sony Ericson phone preandroid and the vCard was processed fine.li liOn a strongGoogle Nexus Sstrong and strongMotorola DroidXstrong, the chooser only allowed me to pick Bluetooth and Gmail. strongthe Messaging app was missing from the chooserstrong.li ul  pMy conclusion  It appears that Android doesnt come with a stock application that is capable of satisfying the Intent specified here. no app allows with the textxvcard mimeType. The Galaxy S comes with its own Messaging app that is capable of handling the vcard mimetype.p  pThats all very well, but how do we go about and solve this p  pI tried the following approach  p  pstrongLaunch the messaging intent directly by specifying the classstrongp  precodeIntent intent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONSEND  i.setClassNamecom.android.mms, com.android.mms.ui.ComposeMessageActivity  i.setTypetextxvcard i.putExtrasmsbody, SomeText i.putExtraIntent.EXTRASTREAM, Uri.parse someFileRef   startActivityi  codepre  pUsing this code, the messaging app is launched directly. This approach was choosen as it at least allows us to pop a messaging app on the Nexus S before with the chooser, the messaging app was not present.p  pOn the strongSamsung Galaxy Sstrong, the attachment is added on the MMS compose screen and is correctly sent. On the strongGoogle Nexcus Sstrong, the attachment is not present.p  pWhen removing the mimeType from the Intent, the Messaging app pops an strongUnsupported media typestrong error message.p  pSo the questions is  is there a simple and uniform piece of code that allows you to send an MMS with a vCard attachment p

Im face palming now that I didnt think of the template scenario.  Specifically, this happens in the WP Super Cache plugin.  I guess Ill have to have a closer look to see if its necessary.

Negative 390 pI have been searching for resources on how to declare foreign key relationships and other constraints using code first EF 4.1 without much luck. Basically I am building the data model in code and using MVC3 to query that model. Everything works via MVC which is great kudos to Microsoft but now I want it NOT to work because I need to have data model constraints. p  pFor example, I have a Order object that has a ton of properties that are external objects tables. Right now I can create an Order no problem, but without being able to add the foreign key or external objects. MVC3 sets this up no problem. p  pI realize that I could just add the objects myself in the controller class prior to save, but I would like the call to DbContext.SaveChanges to fail if the constraint relationships have not been met.p  blockquote   pNEW INFORMATIONp      pSo, specifically, I would like an   exception to occur when I attempt to   save an Order object without   specifying a customer object. This   does not seem to be the behavior if I   just compose the objects as described   in most Code First EF documentation. p blockquote  pLatest codep  precodepublic class Order      public int Id  get set       [ForeignKey Parent ]     public Patient Patient  get set       [ForeignKeyCertificationPeriod]     public CertificationPeriod CertificationPeriod  get set       [ForeignKeyAgency]     public Agency Agency  get set       [ForeignKeyDiagnosis]     public Diagnosis PrimaryDiagnosis  get set       [ForeignKeyOrderApprovalStatus]     public OrderApprovalStatus ApprovalStatus  get set       [ForeignKeyUser]     public User User  get set       [ForeignKeyUser]     public User Submitter  get set       public DateTime ApprovalDate  get set      public DateTime SubmittedDate  get set      public Boolean IsDeprecated  get set   codepre  pThis is the error I get now when accessing the VS generated view for Patientp  blockquote   pERROR MESSAGEp      pThe ForeignKeyAttribute on property   Patient on type   PhysicianPortal.Models.Order is not   valid.

Negative 390 pI have a silverlight expander control which wraps a grid. In the grid, I have a number of text boxes, combo boxes as well as some invisable collapsed text blocks. I also have an animation and when it is triggered the grid shows those hidden text blocks.p  pMy problem is, when the hidden text blocks are shown after the animation is run, these text blocks push other controls down and because the expander doesnt resize itself, the controls at the bottom get pushed outside of the expander and become invisible.p  pI tried to call UpdateLayout after the SizeChanged event of the grid but doesnt work.p  pAny suggestions on how to resolve this issue would be much appreciatedp

Negative 390 pI am using a very basic java sound class to stream audio from Bing Translate for the pronounciation of Chinese characters. Its worked wonderfully for all of the 20 words Ive tested except one. p  pWhen I try to get the pronunciation for the word  which means you, I get the wrong sound. The strange thing is, when I take the URL thats formed in the code and manually put it into a browser Im using the Bing Translate HTTP API, Im getting the correct sound. So it seems to me the error has to be somewhere in my code. The only place I can think of is the buffer. p  pThe really strange thing is that Im not getting silence or gibberish. Instead, the sound thats coming back is the way to say one half literally saying one part of two in chinese. As I said before, when I put the URL into a browser I get the proper sound for you. p  pEDIT Also, if I put  which is plural for you and includes the original character I get the correct sound back.p  pMy code is below.

Negative 390 pRecently I built a GUI app that maps a network connection to a drive in Windows. Unfortunately it uses the WNetAddConnection2 call to accomplish this. Its unfortunate because the Windows API sucks when it comes to Mapping remote WebDAV connections.

Eg a hrefhttpmywebdavserver.tld relnofollowhttpmywebdavserver.tlda. Also SSL doesnt work in XP. Basically, I find using WNetAddConnection2 extremely unreliable.p  pThat said, is there any way to Map a network drive with WebDAV WITHOUT using WNetAddConnection2p  pMany thanks in advance, Bradp

Negative 390 pFollowing on from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6404831this questiona, Im using a simple ViewModel class to test passing a stronglytyped model to a view.  Whilst Darins answer to my original question has solved the problem I had, its now left me scratching my head as to why I cant do the same thing with an EF generated class.  Heres what I havep  precodepublic ActionResult Test      using MyEntities db  new MyEntities              var model  from c in db.Categories                     select new CategoryViewModel  CategoryID  c.CategoryID, Name  c.Name           return Viewmodel.ToList       codepre  pThis is CategoryViewModelp  precodepublic class CategoryViewModel      public int CategoryID  get set      public string Name  get set   codepre  pIn my view Im simply foreaching over the model.  This produces the desired results.  However, one of the classes that was generated for me by EF, is Category.  I was initially trying to use it to build the stronglytyped model and pass that to the view instead, like sop  precodepublic ActionResult Test      using MyEntities db  new MyEntities              var model  from c in db.Categories                     select new Category  CategoryID  c.CategoryID, Name  c.Name           return Viewmodel.ToList       codepre  pThis was giving me the following errorp  pThe entity or complex type MyProjectModel.Category cannot be constructed in a LINQ to Entities query.p  pSo my question is, what is the difference between CategoryViewModel and Category other than Category being generated for me  What is preventing me from using Category as my model type in this scenario  Ive been looking through other questions and answers on SO today but Ive been unable to find something that discusses this.  Ive also seen a few other new terms mentioned in those posts buddy classes, automappers, POCO but it seems premature to look into what they are without understanding the foundation of my problem.p  pId really appreciate some insight.p

Negative 390 pI have a strange problem with firefox 5.0. I have two divs with a fixed size and content. Div A has set the overflow property to hidden and div B to auto. The scroll Event of B is called and in the callback function the scrollTop and scrollLeft values of A and B are synchronized. In Chrome and IE everything is fine, but in firefox scrolling is choppy. I found out that the scrollTop and scrollLeft value in firefox do not increment or decrement fluently like in Chrome and IE. The values of scrollTopLeft are jumping when I am scrolling fast. I tested all this on my Notebook with an external USB mouse. The strange thing is that if i do the same with the touchpad of my notebook scrolling works just fine in Firefox.p

The codeQGraphicsItemcode is in fact a codeQGraphicsItemGroupcode and I can check the issue adding just one item, and in my rotation procedure change the codesetRotationcode method for the codeQTransformcode object. The latter, ignores the codesetTransformOriginPointcode.p  pIm having this issue for a while, and I dig a lot of resources. I browse the Qt C code, and I can see that the codesetRotationcode method modifies a field calles coderotationcode a emrealem value in the codeTransformDatacode structure within the codeQGraphicsItemcode. The origin point is also a two field emrealem value in such a structure called codexOrigincode and codeyOrigincode respectively. The transformation is stored in the codetranformcode field. All this information is used in a variable called codetransformDatacode.p  pSo, I dont get why the transformation set in the codetransformDatagttransformcode field is ignoring the values codetransformDatagtxOrigincode and codetransformDatagtyOrigincode at the time of being applied.p  pThe code I used to test that issue is the following relevant part I have an emrotate itemem that receives mouse inputs and applies rotation to the item itselfp  precode This method using QTransform object.... def mouseMoveEventself, event     if self.pressed         parent     self.parentItem         parentPos  parent.boundingRect.center         newPoint   event.scenePos         iNumber    newPoint.xparentPos.xnewPoint.yparentPos.y1j         angle      cmath.phaseiNumber1.5math.pi         self.appliedRotation   360math.degreesangle360  self.angleOffset         transform  QTransform         transform.rotateself.appliedRotation         self.parentItem.setTransformtransform   ...Against this one using setRotation def mouseMoveEventself, event     if self.pressed         parent     self.parentItem         parentPos  parent.boundingRect.center         newPoint   event.scenePos         iNumber    newPoint.xparentPos.xnewPoint.yparentPos.y1j         angle      cmath.phaseiNumber1.5math.pi         self.appliedRotation   360math.degreesangle360  self.angleOffset         self.parentItem.setRotationself.appliedRotation codepre  pOn both, previously the codesetTransformOriginPointcode is set, but its not a relevant part to show the code, but just to know that it is done.p  pIm getting frustrated to not find a solution to it. As it seems so straightforward, why setting a rotation transformation matrix does not use the transformation origin point that I have set and while using codesetRotationcode method works fine That question took me to the source code, but now is more confusing as rotation is keeping separated from the transformation applied...p

Negative 390 pIm currently trying to create an app that will take a picture and then attach that picture to an email that will be going to a pre determined email address. p  pI have the email working and I have the camera working. I cant seem to get the picture that the camera has taken to add as an attachment. I have the image popping up in the app as a kind of preview image which I have no problem taking out if this is why it wont attach. p  pWhen the email is sent a picture has been created but is corrupt and doesnt open. Its as if Im creating a non existent picture. I think it will be a case of tying the picture taken to the creating attachment part but I have no idea If anybody could help I would be extremely gratefulp  pHere is my codeMainActivitycode where the email is being created along with the camerap  precodeimport java.io.File import java.io.FileNotFoundException import java.io.IOException import java.io.OutputStream  import android.app.Activity import android.content.ContentValues import android.content.Intent import android.graphics.Bitmap import android.net.Uri import android.os.Bundle import android.os.Environment import android.provider.MediaStore.Images import android.provider.MediaStore.Images.Media import android.view.View import android.view.View.OnClickListener import android.widget.Button import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.ImageView  public class EmailActivity extends Activity          Button send         EditText address, subject, emailtext         protected static final int CAMERAPICREQUEST  0        Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.email         sendButton findViewByIdR.id.emailsendbutton         addressEditText findViewByIdR.id.emailaddress         subjectEditText findViewByIdR.id.emailsubject         emailtextEditText findViewByIdR.id.emailtext          send.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener                           Override                         public void onClickView v                                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                              if                             Environment.MEDIAMOUNTED.equalsEnvironment.getExternalStorageState                                                                                         File pngDir  new File                                      Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory,                                     Androiddatacom.phstudios.jbrefurbquote                              if pngDir.exists                                 pngDir.mkdirs                              File pngFile  new FilepngDir, pic1.png                             Uri pngUri  Uri.fromFilepngFile                                        Intent emailIntent  new Intentandroid.content.Intent.ACTIONSEND                                        emailIntent.setTypeimagepng                                        emailIntent.putExtraandroid.content.Intent.EXTRAEMAIL, new String[] randomyahoo.co.uk                                        emailIntent.putExtraandroid.content.Intent.EXTRASUBJECT, subject.getText                                        emailIntent.putExtraandroid.content.Intent.EXTRATEXT, emailtext.getText                                        emailIntent.putExtraandroid.content.Intent.EXTRASTREAM, pngUri                                        emailIntent.setTypeimagepng                                       EmailActivity.this.startActivityIntent.createChooseremailIntent, Send mail...

Furthermore the definition on the apple link above states emTo prevent the loss of its connection, a VoIP app typically needs to wake up periodically and check in with its server. To facilitate this behavior, iOS lets you install a special handler using the codesetKeepAliveTimeouthandlercode method of codeUIApplicationcodeem  From my understanding of that this timeout thing should only be doing the keepalive, however that doesnt make sense because the minimal time is 600seconds  And like I said above I cannot find where I tell it what packet to look for as well as what to do when its found.p

I created an XML layout, that contains a blank ListView, amongst other things and I want my list to go into that allotted space...so my question  How do I get my ListActivity to use my layout XML filep  precode    public class MainList extends ListActivity      static SharedPreferences statusSettings     String jsonString     static JSONObject json     static JSONArray arrayTest     static int bob  3        Override     protected void onListItemClickListView l, View v, int position, long id           TODO Autogenerated method stub         super.onListItemClickl, v, position, id          try              JSONObject e  arrayTest.getJSONObjectposition             Intent intent  new Intent             intent.putExtraclientName, e.getStringprojname             intent.putExtraclientAddress, e.getStringcaddress             intent.putExtraclientComments, e.getStringcomments             intent.putExtraclientOrder, e.getStringorder             intent.setClassMainList.this, ClientDetails.class             MainList.this.startActivityintent            catch JSONException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             Log.eJSON, Problem creating object from array             e.printStackTrace                    private static class EfficientAdapter extends BaseAdapter          private LayoutInflater mInflater           public EfficientAdapterContext context               Cache the LayoutInflate to avoid asking for a new one each time.             mInflater  LayoutInflater.fromcontext                    public int getCount              return arrayTest.length                    public Object getItemint position              return position                   public long getItemIdint position              return position                   public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent               ViewHolder holder              if convertView  null                  convertView  mInflater.inflateR.layout.mainlist, null                  holder  new ViewHolder                 holder.textName  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.tvMainName                 holder.textAddress  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.tvMainAddress                   convertView.setTagholder              else                   holder  ViewHolder convertView.getTag                            JSONObject e             try                  e  arrayTest.getJSONObjectposition                 holder.textName.setTexte.getStringprojname                 holder.textAddress.setTexte.getStringcaddress                      switch statusSettings.getInte.getStringorder, 0                     case 1                         convertView.setBackgroundColor0x00000000                         break                     case 2                         ifbob  3                             convertView.setBackgroundColor0xFFFF6600                             bob  5                                                  break                     case 3                         convertView.setBackgroundColor0xFF00CC00                         break                     case 4                         convertView.setBackgroundColor0xFFCC0000                         break                                  catch JSONException e1                   TODO Autogenerated catch block                 Log.eJSON, Couldnt put one of JSON arrays into object                 e1.printStackTrace                             return convertView                   static class ViewHolder              TextView textName             TextView textAddress                    Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         jsonString  getIntent.getExtras.getStringjsonString         try              json  new JSONObjectjsonString             arrayTest  json.getJSONArrayclientlist          catch JSONException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             Log.eJSON, Couldnt create the JSON Array             e.printStackTrace                  setListAdapternew EfficientAdapterthis            Override     protected void onResume           TODO Autogenerated method stub         super.onResume         bob  3          statusSettings  getSharedPreferencesstatus, 0            setListAdapternew EfficientAdapterthis         codepre  pXML Filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationvertical gt      ltListView         androidididlist         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidlayoutweight1gt     ltListViewgt       ltButton         androidididbutton1         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextButton gt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pThe thing is, they create it without using any XML layout  I dont fully understand how, but I assume it has something to do with the LayoutInflater.

Negative 390 pIve been trying to set up a server that are going to expose some public web services. I do have a lot of problems when I try to Autowire objects, and setup a connection with a MySQL database.

Negative 390 pWe are switching from a nonclustered to a 2node clustered MSMQ Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Enterprise environment. Previously, when it was nonclustered, we wrote a .NET 3.5 C Windows Form application to help us manage our environment so it does tasks such as create queues with the right permissions, read messages, forward messages, etc.. I would like to make this application work with our new cluster. p  pPer these articles, brbr a hrefhttpblog.terranspot.com201107accessingmicrosoftmessagequeuing.html relnofollowhttpblog.terranspot.com201107accessingmicrosoftmessagequeuing.htmla br a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combjohnbreakwellarchive20080218clusteringmsmqapplicationsrule1.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combjohnbreakwellarchive20080218clusteringmsmqapplicationsrule1.aspxabr br I understand that I need to add the application as a resource on the cluster as when I dont, I am accessing the nodes MSMQ instance. To help with my debugging, I have turned the local MSMQ services off. No matter what I do, however, the program keeps trying to access the nodes instance. I added it as an application resource with the command line of QQueueManagerConsole.exe. The Q is the disk that is shared between the 2 nodes that is part of the failover cluster, but when I run it via Windows Explorer, it doesnt see the cluster instance, only the local. I have seen no way to execute a program from Failover Cluster Manager, so I dont understand what I am doing wrong. I switched the code to access everything via . so MessageQueue.GetPrivateQueuesByMachine., which, per my meager understanding is how you access the local queue. Could someone explain, preferably acting as if I had no clue what I was doing, on a. if this IS possible and b. HOW to do this correctlyp

Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.                If the persistent store is not accessible, there is typically something wrong with the file path. Often, a file URL is pointing into the applications resources directory instead of a writeable directory.

Negative 390 pSo I created this application, that displays widgets. Each widget is a code.phpcode file that displays different type of data from the mysql database. Also I created a file codeoptions.phpcode, that each user can access and they can change the codepositioncode where each widget is displayed, the codeheightcode, the codecolorcode, and the codewidthcode. lets say the widget is a div with info pulled out for the databasep  pThe issue I am having is how to store the data to be specific to the user. At this point after the button save is pushed it codeUPDATEScode all the rows while each row contains a specific widget options.p  pcodeFor examplecodebr Options table has these fields code[id] [name] [height] [position] [color]code.

Negative 390 pI have a class in my project that manages autoloading.  Each new instance of the class adds its autoload function to the SPL autoload stack, and unsetting an instance removes its own instance from the stack.  The class also exports a register  and unregister  method that lets you remove it from the autoload stack on a temporary basis.  p  pIm attempting to write a unit test for the autoloader and have run into a few problems.  I include the autoloader in my PHPUnit bootstrap script so other classes under test can autoload as they would under normal use.  I want to disable this behaviour for the duration of the autoloader unit test, as while I can unit test without disabling the normal autoloader, I couldnt be sure if my unit test was passing or failing due to the instance of the autoloader thats in the bootstrap or the instance Im testing.  p  pI tried doing the following in my bootstrap filep  precodeunitTestAutoloader  new gordianreefknotautoloadAutoload  codepre  pand then implementing the following code in my unit testp  precodenamespace gordianreefknotautoload  use gordianexampleclasses     Test class for Autoload.   Generated by PHPUnit on 20111217 at 181033.   class AutoloadTest extends PHPUnitFrameworkTestCase     var gordianreefknotautoloadAutoload   protected object  public function construct        Disable the unit test autoloader for the duration of the following test     global unitTestAutoloader     unitTestAutoloader gt unregister    public function destruct        Restore normal autoloading when the test is done     global unitTestAutoloader     unitTestAutoloader gt register       Sets up the fixture, for example, opens a network connection.   This method is called before a test is executed.   protected function setUp       this gt object  new Autoload , gordianexampleclasses, DIR . exampleclasses        Unit tests go here  codepre  pI thought this would work, but unfortunately it just throws an error when I run all unit tests instead, apparently because the autloader isnt functioning for any of the other unit tests.  p  pMy suspicion is PHPUnit initializes all the unit test classes before running all tests, and my autoloader test class is preventing the other test classes from autoloading the classes they are meant to test.  Is this correct  p  pIs there some way I can work around this problem  Would I be able to disable the default autoloader some way other than doing it in the test constructor  Any advice in this case would be appreciated. p

Negative 390 pIm using a Rails Stack with strongnginx  unicorn  railsstrong meant for a production server, but Im staging it under Vagrant for testing purposes. While doing this, I encountered a strange behavior of the rails application, where very often one or other asset wasnt being served, i.e. application.css isnt being served and therefore the whole page is displayed without any styles applied to it.p  pIve googled the problem and found that Vagrants FS driver isnt completely implemented and that would bring some problems while using Apache havent found any mentions to nginx. The solution to this problem was to disable sendfile by adding strongsendfile offstrong to the configuration file. And... it didnt work.p  pFurther, I went through the logs Rails, unicorn and nginx and found that when the file isnt served, there isnt any mention to it in any of the logs. This brought me to the question that the problem can be in the mechanism used by Vagrant to share the strongrails appstrong folder through the VM. As mentioned in vagrants website, Vagrant uses Virtual Boxs Shared Folders, which is quite slow comparing to other alternatives as shown a hrefhttpvagrantup.comdocsnfs.html relnofollowherea, and the workaround is to set up NFS Shared Folders. So, I decided to give NFS a try and the result was... the same.

Negative 390 pI am decorating a standard text input with the jquery plugin for tags input, which essentially replaces the text input in my HTML with a text area where users can write tag names and hit enter to have them converted to discrete graphical tags. see demo at a hrefhttpxoxco.comprojectscodetagsinput relnofollowhttpxoxco.comprojectscodetagsinputap  pI am placing an ngModel directive in the original text input.p  pI am able to keep my scope updated with changes made in the tags input field by listening to the change handler from the plugin, parsing the ngModel attribute from the original text input html tag, and updating the scope directly.p  pHowever, the issue is that when Angular detects a change in the model and updates the view using binding, it is setting the value on the original text input which does not cause any sort of event I can bind to to know when to update the plugins value, since change only fires due to user input.p  pIs there a way to modify the default ngModel directive behavior to have it fire an event or run a function I specify when it is processing bindings, specifically from model to viewp

Negative 390 pSorry if my question seems too general, I have a mobile app idea, which I am planning to work on as a side hobby. I have never built such a system from the scratch, therefore architectural decisions become incredibly important given the fact that I have only nights and weekends to work on this project. p  pAs far as I see , mobile apps are generally backed by a web site which is offering similar or even broader service. My target mobile audiences will be android and ios. My plan is having a service that interacts with db and on the higher level an iPhone app, android app and a fully functional web site will be talking to this generic servicecommon code base. I am thinking about going with a restful api, and transfer json to all of these three platforms. Does that sound like a good approach p  pAlso from hosting perspective what would be more cost effective I am more familiar coding in asp.net or java than php, can web frameworks like symfony save me hours and bucks or will it only complicate things As far as I know AWS has higher rates for hosting .net apps. For the db, I would like to go with mongodb just like foursquare did , since I will be storing a lot of geographical data. p  pFeel free to share your experiences if you have gone through a similar decision process in the past. p

Negative 390 pThis is a problem we never had to deal with until storyboards were introduced  Whenever there was a chance of conflict in UI, we just made sure that no 2 developers ever worked on the same XIB file simultaneously. The reason we refrained from resolving XIB conflicts is that there may be problematic sideeffects XIB is represented in XML format so there isnt a good way to merge 2 versions.p  pNow we are facing this issue because all of our UI elements are within the same .storyboard file  prevention of simultaneous work on any 2 UI elements in the project makes working in parallel very difficult.p  pAny suggestions as to how to tackle this issue Thanks in advance for your efforts.p

Negative 390 pIm working on an architecture HibernateJPASpringZk, and I multiply the questions these days because I have to learn a lot of framework.p  pI have a question that leaves me perplexed for several days.p  pI hear about the pattern OpenSessionInView to keep alive a Hibernate transaction to make lazy loading. Many also say that pattern is not very clean.p  pAnd on the other, it is said that PersistentContext extended is not thread safe, and is therefore not suitable for keeping alive the entityManager.p  pSo, what is the real solution to these problems I presume that these issues arise from the introduction of ajax which allows more possibilities especially with the use lazy loading to load some heavy Collections when necessary.p  pFor moment, i tried PersistenceContext in extended mode. Its working... I had to set it for my JUnit tests, et its working too in my web application with lazy loading without more configurations.p  pIs that the evolution of framework Spring, JPA 2.0 mean that it is now easier and more clean work with PersistentContextp  pIf this is not the case, should we use the OpenSessionInViewFilter from Spring and replace the PersistentContext in transactional modep  pThank you.p

Negative 390 pI think this might just come down to me not completely understanding the correct thing to do when an app gets a memory warning or maybe I dont understand what iOS does on its own when you get a memory warning.p  pHere is a simplified version of my problemp  pI have a codeRootViewControllercode. It pushes a codeTextViewControllercode where I have a codeUITextFieldcode. The codeTextViewControllercode can push a codeDetailViewControllercode that shows some details.p  pIf I push all the way to the codeDetailsViewControllercode, so that my navigation view controller stack is code[RootVC, TextVC, DetailVC]code, and then simulate a memory warning, codeTextVCcode gets unloaded from memory automatically by iOS.p  pstrongProblem 1strong iOS just decided my view controller should be unloaded. When the user pops codeDetailVCcode to get back to codeTextVCcode, where am I supposed to save the state information e.g. the text entered in the text field Right now, the text field just goes back to blank because the view controller got unloaded and then reloaded.p  pstrike strongProblem 2strong When I pop back to codeTextVCcode and tap the text field, my app crashes. Turning on zombies revealed that some codeUIViewcode was getting a coderesponderDidBecomeActivecode message from somewhere when I tapped on the text field. How is this even possible with ARC In my codeviewDidUnloadcode method I am setting the text field to nil and even setting its delegate property to nil.p  pEDIT. strongNew questionstrong I just totally fixed everything by overriding codedidReceiveMemoryWarningcode for codeTextVCcode and having it not do anything. On a scale from 1 to really bad, how bad is this strikep  pEDIT 2. strongJust kidding,strong Im an idiot and forgot to remove an observer for a notification in a totally different but related piece of code. I still dont understand howwhere state information is supposed to be saved when iOS just throws out your crap.p

Negative 390 pSo I am working with a few other developers on an iOS app that has push notifications enabled. We have a provisioning profile that supports push and we each have our own developer certificates with which to sign the code. All standard stuff from what I understand.p  pThe problem we are running into is that Xcode requires to you pick a dev cert in the Project andor Target setting under Code Signing Identity when you want to run the app on a phone. If I pick my dev cert and check that change into git, then it wont work on anyone elses development environment because they dont have my cert in their keychain. So everybody is constantly changing the project file so it works with their cert.p  pIs there no way around this I realize there is the automatic profile selection option, but that doesnt work with push notifications. If you try that you get the errorp  precodeFailed to obtain push notification token Error DomainNSCocoaErrorDomain Code3000 no valid apsenvironment entitlement string found for application codepre  pwhen the phone tries to register to receive its push token.p  pSurely this has been solved.

This is accomplished by exposing the MOC via a property on this object codeselfcode that maintains an codeNSMutableDictionarycode of thread names call codedescriptioncode on codeNSThreadcode to codeNSManagedObjectContextcodes.  When accessed, if there isnt a MOC for code[NSThread currentThread]code, it creates a new one, adds it to the dictionary, and stores it.

Negative 390 pIs there any drawback to not having a primary key for a table in Postgres  Since all data is stored unordered in the heap anyway, is the primary key just a way to enforce a unique key and an index at the same time  Or is there a fundamental feature that a primary key provides in a table as opposed to a table that does not have a primary key p
Negative 390 pIve been programming in Rails for about 7 months now. Mainly an app to aministrate a database, you know, clean up, update, delete, find orphaned entries etc. p  pI have an API that talks to our desktop programs written in PHP. We now find ourselves wanting to move everything over to Ruby. This API needs to be lightning quick and will not have any views or HTML pages of any sort, it will only communicate with our apps via JSON, sending and receiving data that the apps will then display and work with. p  pSo, the basic question is, should I learn Sinatra and Padrino with ActiveRecord and build the API with them, or do it in Railsp  pIf I use Rails I could keep a lot of the code I have or even use the existing code since all the tables are the same database is the same and just write more methods for the API. p  pThe downside I see to this is twofoldp  ol liIt means the code is harder to manage and read because now we have the API bit and all the maintenance bit. li liIt would mean that the same Ruby app is doing double work so the API would not be as fast as if it were running in another, separate Ruby app. li liAlready the Rails app is not great speedwise but I suspect this has more to do with our hosting solution than Rails itself. li ol  pLearning Sinatra and Padrino might be more work, but would lead to cleaner code and a separate Ruby app for the API and another one for the maintenance which sounds nicer. p  pBut I dont know anything about Sinatra and Padrino, is the footprint and speed emreallyem that better than Railsp  pI would greatly appreciate opinions from people who have actually used both Rails and Sinatra with Padrino on this. p  pCheers. p

Negative 390 pI posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9204919custommembershiproleprofileproviderswithoutinheritingthemembershipprovidthis questiona about 8 months ago.  The accepted answer touches on some of the things you would miss out on by not playing by the default providers rules.  For example, if you do not use a custom RoleProvider that inherits from RoleProvider, you lose the ability to use quick shortcuts like codeUser.IsInRolecode .  The answer refers to things like this as builtin plumbing.p  pWhat I wish to know is where I can find a complete list of stuff that relies on this builtin plumbing, and something that shows to which overriden methods they are calling behind the scenes.p  pFor example, codeHttpContext.Current.User.IsInRolecode is I assume referring to and calling my overriden IsUserInRole method in my custom RoleProvider, but I would like to see the documentation where it is explicitly stated that codeHttpContext.Current.User.IsInRolecode is actually calling codeIsUserInRolecode, for all such methods for all providers.p  pI understand that it should be kind of obvious already IsInRole and IsUserInRole are so similar, but my motivation for asking is to see and learn about the other kinds of such shortcuts that are available that Im not even aware of.  I have a feeling that Ive reinvented the wheel several times, and I dont even know it.p

Negative 390 pIm using a formset to collect multiple forms worth of data on one page but something I realized is that the .astable display for a formset is slightly suboptimal for what Im trying to do, rather than print each form element as a new table row I was thinking of printing each form itself as an individual row and having a table header with the field names since I know my formset would have the same fields for each form instance. In this way you get a grid of data that a use can fill in. Ive done it manually through the template where the form is printed but I was wondering if there was any way I could override formset.astable to print it in that form rather than in the way its presently done. Is this possible, has it already been done somewhere or if not how would you suggest I go about itp
Negative 390 pWe developed a shopping cart script that use Profile for anonymous users to save the cart.

We added in global.asax to take all errors and send by email to us, but there is no error, the cart simply is empty. We found this adding in all final steps login, register, shipping, payment, conclusion a function to check cart items. Sometimes the user go to login, register, shipping.. and in payment all items is lost.

Negative 390 pI want a program that parses a XMLfile, build a structure with the tags I need and finally print a HTMLreport using HTMLtemplates with keywords that get replaced by the data from the XML files.

A parser class and a data class. the first one to go through the XMLfile and report every tag I want to store to a data object which stores all the tags in a hierarchical order. After that I want to call a print function which prints everything as HTMLreport.p  ol liIm not sure how to report the tags to the data objectli liCould I store the tags in one object which stores a tree of structs or would it be better to store each tag in a separate objectli ol  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 390 pIm trying to enable image uploads for a model in my Rails app. Im using the CarrierWave gem, but in order to do any image manipulation like thumbnail resizing I must have Imagemagick installed on the actual computer for use with the Rmagick gem.p  pHeres the problem Im turning this app over to a painter who will log in and upload her own art. This means she wont be in my development environment that has Imagemagick installed. Im really confused about the role of Imagemagick here  will image manipulation simply not work anymore when the app is deployed, or does it persist somehowp  pFeel free to correct me if my understanding of this is completely screwy. Or, is there a better solution availablep
Negative 390 pi have the following problem. Im writing a website with strongjQuery Mobilestrong the data comes from a strongdrupal cmsstrong. p  pMy biggest problem at the moment is, that I have an image where the user should be able to touch to get additional information. The problem is, the image should not rotate when the device is rotated.p  pMy solution at the moment is, to change the image when the device is rotated to the same image but 90 rotated. For the points where the user can touch I use codedivcodes with a custom touch event. The problem now is, that if the image is changed, the codedivcodes are not on the same position on the image I know that the top and left have now changed, so i changed them accordingly  the new left is the old top etc.. p  pIs there any way to solve this Maybe it is somehow possible to prevent the image from rotating in the first place. p

Negative 390 pIm new to cakePHP and trying to get my head around when something is best developed as a ModelBehavior or ControllerComponent. I have an athletics scheduling system where various types of data, such as Venues, Schools, and Divisions get assigned to Sports. Taking Venues as an example Venue and Sport have a HABTM association. I will be building a tool which allows users to select a Sport, and in so doing, view the Venues assigned to the Sport list A, as well as the Venues that have not been assigned to the Sport list B. They can then delete assigned venues from list A or add unassigned venues from list B. A pretty basic tool which I know how to code in PHP. I have several of these same assignment tools throughout the app, which is why I want to abstract out.p  pI originally thought of building a Component, allowing me to get the two lists, and perform the adds amp deletes, but am now wondering whether I can fatten my Models by creating a Behavior. Im just a little lost conceptually, and would appreciate any clarification.p

As you can see, codesunrisecode and codesunsetcode are being set to code1code after that.  Which also implies that the codedayLengthcode that I calculate will always be code0code.  As you can see in the code, Ive tried using the a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.datesunrise.php relnofollowcodedatesunrisecodea and a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.datesunset.php relnofollowcodedatesunsetcodea during my troubleshooting, but after codedatediffcode, those always return code1code on subsequent page loads as well.p  pOther things I have tried Sectioning off the codedayLengthcode calculation within its own function and within its own namespace.  Clearing the cache, different browser, etc.p  pI do realize that there are other ways to calculate the codedayLengthcode without the use of this function, and have implemented those so the API will work as expected.  My question is, why does codedatesuninfocode produce different results after the first load of the page when using codedatediffcode  Ive searched the bugs of PHP and couldnt find anything, nor could I find anything that would result with this error any where else.  I am hoping someone can enlighten me as to the cause of this.  It was replicated on two machines, both with PHP 5.3.x and Apache 2.2, one was with Windows 7, the other Ubuntu. p

Negative 390 pWe have a daily data feed. I need to determine what rows are new. Its a long story, but there are no record numbers for the rows and they arent going to be any. We need to be able to identify which rows are new since the previous data feed.

Then we are supposed to use v1 and v2 to produce the output in the following format.p  precodev3  v1  v2  v1[0]v2[0]  v1[1]v2[1] .... v1[n]v2[n] v3  v1  v2  v1[0]v2[0]  v1[1]v2[1] .... v1[n]v2[n] v3  v1  v2  v1[0]v2[0]  v1[1]v2[1]  ....  v1[n]v2[n] codepre  pIf the number of elements in v1 and v2 are not the same or one of them is empty, we are supposed to produce an error message.p  pExamplep  pIf v1s dynamic array has 3 elements 1.0  2.5  3.0p  pIf v2s dynamic array has 3 elements 2.0  2.0  1.0p  pThen the output isp  precodev3  v1  v2  3.0   4.5   4.0 v3  v1  v2  1.0  0.5   2.0 v3  v1  v2  10 codepre  pNow, my problem is that I keep getting Error The function processVector must have a prototype. even though the function prototype for processVector does exist.p  pSo far what I have is as followp  precode    includeltiostreamgt   class AVector     private       int size       double array    public       AVector                 array  NULL               AVectorint                 double input          size  a          array  new double[size]           int counter  0           whilecounter lt size                       cin gtgt input             array[counter]  input             counter                         AVector                 delete[] array               void printArrayint a                 cout ltlt Euclidean vector v ltlt a ltlt             forint i  0 i lt size i                       cout ltlt array[i] ltlt                      cout ltlt  ltlt endl               void processVectorAVector a, AVector b                 ifa.size  b.size                       cout ltlt Two Euclidean vector should be in the same Euclidean space ltlt endl                    else                       ...                   codepre  pmain.cppp  precodeincludeltiostreamgt include AVector2.h using namespace std  int main     int dimension     cout ltlt Input dimension and tuples for a Euclidean vector v1     cin gtgt dimension    AVector v1  AVectordimension    v1.printArray1      cout ltlt endl     cout ltlt Input dimension and tuples for a Euclidean vector v2     cin gtgt dimension    AVector v2  AVectordimension    v2.printArray2     cout ltlt endl     processVectorv1, v2    return 0  codepre  pId very much appreciate it if someone can point out what I did wrong.

Negative 390 pso recently I asked a question to see if a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15956947canmultiplewtapplicationsrunonsameportCan multiple WT applications run on same porta and the answer was a yes, 1 to Jorge Nez for that awesome answer. However, now I am trying to take his solution a step further to see if multiple WT applications can be run on the same page, by embedding them in a kind of host WT application. What I have done is created a host WT application that has an accessor for its root and has a WTabWidget. Then in the CreateHostApplication function I created tabs for the 2 test applications, which also have accessors for their root, and added their root to the tab that belongs to my host application, then after all the apps were added to their individual tabs, I returned the host.p  pThe cool part is that the widgets from the test applications showed up in their tabs as I expected, what I didnt expect is that the connect calls to connect buttons to functions failed. So the widgets are functional as far as clicking them and editing text in boxes goes, but they do nothing else as they are not connected to any custom functions.p  pAfter debugging this for a bit, am pretty sure the connect calls failed on the test apps because they are not actually hosted by the browser, which brings me here. I have not been able to find a solution to this problem, is there a way to get the connect calls functional with this setupp  pThe code below is the solution by Jorge Nez, with the above mentioned modifications. I am using visual studio2010 for development.

Negative 390 pI was trying to change the table names in the entity model or database but the old names are already use in many places in the application. Is there any way to auto reflect renamed entities or tables in the LINQ query or code. p  pLet say I have tables tblDepartment, tblEmployee and tblEmployeeDepartment. These tables are used in the codeLINQ on many places. I like to change these tables names to Department, Employee and EmployeeDepartment. So, is there anyway to auto reflect name in LINQ or code when I change table names either using Database First or Model First approach. p  pP.S. The application is based on .Net 3.5p

Negative 390 pI am using AutoMoqCustomization in my test conventions.p  pConsider the code below.  Everything works great until I add a constructor to one of the concrete classes.  When I do, I get could not find a parameterless constructor.  We know AutoFixture doesnt have an issue with the constructor because it delivered me the test object codeonecode which proved to be assignable from IThings... no failure there.  So it must be moq.p  pThis makes some sense because I assume codebuildercode was generated by moq and passed into the codeGetCommandscode method.  So I think I can see that control has been passed from AutoFixture to moq at that point.p  pThat takes care of the why, but what should I do about it  Is there a way to instruct moq on how to deal with the codeThingOnecode or is there a way to instruct AutoFixture to ignore moq for codeIThingBuilderscode and instead do something Fixturyp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class TestClass      public interface IThingBuilders              T1 BuildltT1gt where T1  IThings          public interface IThings               public class ThingOne  IThings              public ThingOnestring someparam                            public class ThingTwo  IThings               public class SomeClass              public ListltIThingsgt GetCommandsIThingBuilders builder                      var newlist  new ListltIThingsgt             newlist.Addbuilder.BuildltThingOnegt             newlist.Addbuilder.BuildltThingTwogt             return newlist                   [Theory, BasicConventions]     public void WhyCannotInstantiateProxyOfClassThingOne one, ThingTwo two, IThingBuilders builder, SomeClass sut              Assert.IsAssignableFromltIThingsgtone         Assert.IsAssignableFromltIThingsgttwo          var actual  sut.GetCommandsbuilder          Assert.Equal1, actual.OfTypeltThingOnegt.Count         Assert.Equal1, actual.OfTypeltThingTwogt.Count       codepre
Negative 390 pI have a website in development which is using paypal sandbox to accept payments. Ive setup a few sandbox users so I can test what happens when payments are send from my country and some foreign countries.p  pIve noticed that when setting up users with certain foreign countries, after making a payment, the foreign sandbox account gets a message saying youre payment will arrive in 35 days. But the payment happens instantly in the sandbox account.p  pWhy is that, is that just a sandbox thing What I am asking is, when I go live, and if the user gets such a message, and if it does take 35 days for the payment to arrive, will paypal push the payment through to my ipn page as and when the payment happens, i.e. 35 days laterp  pIm assuming that because I am using the paypal sandbox, they just display the 35 day message and push the details to my ipn page straight awayp

Negative 390 pThis is a two part question. The first questionp  pSo I have an app that transitions from one screen to another, using nib files. heres the code i use to switch screensp  precodeself.transitionView  [[TransitionViewController alloc] initWithNibNameTransitionViewController bundlenil]  [self.view addSubview self.transitionView.view] codepre  pmy problem is i have about 30  40 lines of code in the viewdidload method that could conceivably be slowing the transition down slightly, as some of the code uses NSURL to read data in, but its a 2  3 second wait between when it enters the viewdidload method and when the view actually finishes loading. the line code[super viewdidload]code is at the very top of all of this too, which is the most confusing part. so why is my program taking 2  3 seconds to load i think thats a pretty long time considering how little code i have there.p  ppart 2 of the question is i want to create a transition screen that appears for 2  3 seconds before the actual screen loads. Ive taken that code out and for some reason my nib file still takes forever to load so i know it has nothing to do with that, but the transition screen needs to pop up BEFORE screen 2 for 3 seconds, even if the app is being opened after 10 minutes. i know there was a function in appdelegate that could assist in this endeavor but im at a loss for what the code should look like. it doesnt seem to be switching withp  precodeself.transitionView  [[TransitionViewController alloc] initWithNibNameTransitionViewController bundlenil]  [self.view addSubview self.transitionView.view] codepre  pand aside from that, im at a loss for an understanding about how the code should be constructed to switch between screens in that fashion. any articles or suggestions anybody can give mep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI also tried to separate the NSURL data in the viewdidload method from the method itself. i put it all in a method called initialize, and called it from screen 1 right after calling the 2nd view. it didnt help the switching time at all. the reason i did that is because i didnt want to receive all the nsurl data over again when the person opens the app. i just want them to retrieve it one time and be done with it. am i doing somethign wrong here this is extremely frustratingp

Negative 390 pI need to link up an .xls must not have macros to a macro on our network.  I thought I had found a good solution, which uses a shape to link up to a macro that is set an addin in Excel.  This method worked well for over a year, but now things are starting to act REALLY ODD.  Excel keeps changing my links from the network to the local drive p  pBasically, at my computer I run code that creates a button and sets the .OnAction value to SPCBUTTONS.xlamEXPORTSPC which excel sometimes updates to GNetworkLocationSPCBUTTONS.xlamEXPORTSPC sometimes it  leaves it alone.  I linked up the addin to run from the network and dont copy it locally so this is a correct address for it.  However when I move the file from my computer, to the network and on to the final computer, the link will change to CNetworkLocationSPCBUTTONS.xlamEXPORTSPC. The files links work until the point it lands on the local computer. p  precodeCheck if SPC Button already exists Dim exportButton As Shape On Error Resume Next     Set exportButton  InspectionWS.ShapesSPC Button On Error GoTo 0  If Not exportButton Is Nothing Then     Delete the old button     InspectionWS.ShapesSPC Button.Delete End If  Create SPC Button InspectionWS.Shapes.AddShapemsoShapeRectangle, 770, 600, 160, 36.Name  SPC Button Set exportButton  InspectionWS.ShapesSPC Button  With exportButton     .ShapeStyle  msoShapeStylePreset34     .TextFrame2.TextRange.Characters.Text  Export SPC Data     .TextFrame2.TextRange.Font.Size  20     .TextFrame2.WordArtformat  msoTextEffect8     .OnAction  EXPORTSPC End With codepre  pThe first time I saw this problem was when I had changed the addin. I had made another macro in that file called EXPORTSPC2, and had swapped names with original when it was time to go live. Thats when all of the links became broken.  I swapped back the names and decided to just swap the code, in case position mattered.  Still didnt help with the linking.p  pI looped the original macro that set up the buttons on every file again, but that failed to rectify the problem. Several hours later, after trying a lot of options I found setting .OnAction to just EXPORTSPC did again get some files to link up again, but ONLY if I did it on the local computer. I had tried the full address, a local address and moving the addin location, and SPCBUTTONS.xlamEXPORTSPC and of those still ended up with CNetworklocation.xlamEXPORTSPC... even when set on the local computer.p  pThe problem is, yesterday, it happened again when someone had replaced the updated files with another set of files he had been modifying on the network.  This time around I wasnt surprised to see that they didnt link up although disappointed, but was surprised that the my code looping the update to EXPORTSPC failed to take for all of the files on the second computer.  Only a handful of them would actually change to EXPORTSPC, and I ended up having to assign the link locally on the final computers, by hand, for each of the 45 .xls files.  p  pReally, I cant keep doing any of this local repairing, as it creates machine downtime.p  pSo my questions  Is there a better way to do what Im trying to accomplish .xls to addin  Any idea as to why is moving these files causing excel to change the link, forcing me to set them up locally  Why does it suddenly not accept anything but EXPORTSPC as the link name  Does excel save some sort of ID for macrosaddinbuttons Im unaware of Im accidently breaking p  pReally, Any sort of insight will help.  Thanks  p  pstrongEDITstrong  p  pI did find an error in my looping code, which effected the issue I had on the second computer.  It was looping through each workbook fine and saving... but I didnt activate the workbook before running the code, which was pretty important DOH.  This only resolves the problem I ran into yesterday where I had to edit by hand.p  pHowever, digging a little deeper, I do feel like I have a better understanding.  I used the code below to determine if what I see in Assign Macro matches the stored .OnAction value, which it does not.  Testing on my computer this codep  precodeexportButton.OnAction  GNetworkLocationSPCBUTTONS.xlamEXPORTSPC  codepre  pwould cause the Assign Macro to change to EXPORTSPC, even though debuggingp  precodedebug.print exportButton.OnAction codepre  pstill displayed the original OnAction value.  When I moved the file to the shop floor computer, assign macro would display GNetworkLocationSPCBUTTONS.xlamEXPORTSPC until I clicked it, and then it would switch to EXPORTSPC.p  pSo it seems Excel does keep track of where the macro is located once it detects the correct location.  I swapped the macros around and it seemed to have broke the connection.  My guess is excel then modifies the location to the C once its internal link is broken.  If anyone has any elaborationverification of this, Id love to hear it.p  pI do recall having the addin button becoming unchecked randomly, which may have been playing into why links kept breaking and reverting to the c while I was debugging what would work.  Im not sure what was causing that either.  But using the all forms of exporting seemed to work today.

Negative 390 pI am trying to program an alternative landscape view file an xml file for my app, and I must use FrameLayout instead of LinearLayout thats what the book said. But Framelayout does not stack well, so we are supposed to use codeandroidlayoutgravitycode and then assign an xy dimension, for example codeandroidlayoutgravitycentercode. This example centers something exactly in the middle both vertically and horizontally.p  pBut my problem is, I have 4 levels on the vertical plane, where I want to place things. A text line, a line with 2 buttons true, false, another button cheat, then finally a line with 2 arrow buttons previous and next. But with the layoutgravity, they only have very crude placements top, center, bottom. I noticed that if you do not assign anything, they all end up in the upper left corner. p  pSo how do I stack these vertically so they fall nicely spaced from top to bottom Assigning 2 things the same parameters does not stack them, but rather overlaps them terribly.p  pThank you for your help, below is my code. I have not put any gravity layouts in there yet.p  precodeltFrameLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltTextView          androidididquestiontextview         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidpadding24dp gt              ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidorientationhorizontal gt          ltButton             androidididtruebutton             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidtextstringtruebutton gt          ltButton             androidididfalsebutton             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidtextstringfalsebutton gt      ltLinearLayoutgt      ltButton          androidididcheatbutton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextstringcheatbutton gt      ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidorientationhorizontal gt          ltImageButton         androidididprevbutton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidsrcdrawablearrowleft         androidcontentDescriptionstringmoveback          gt          ltImageButton         androidididnextbutton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidsrcdrawablearrowright         androidcontentDescriptionstringmoveforward         gt      ltLinearLayoutgt  ltFrameLayoutgt   codepre

The only way I got around it was by getting the root AutomationElement, then utilizing the codeTreeWalker.ControlViewWalkercode I used the code found in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19410808347172this answera, however that solution doesnt give me access to the control itself, just the codeAutomationElementcode. Ideally, since there is an AutomationPeer for the control, I was wondering if there was a better way to get at this control even if it is impossible to get to for the UIMap.p  hr  pAlso, a side note. I understand already that Visual Studio ignores codeTextBlockcodes when doing Coded UI Testing because there can be so many produced. Right now Im more concerned with getting to the codeItemsControlcode itself, not the individual codeTextBlockcodes that are generated from within it.p

Negative 390 pstrongSOLVEDstrong  emPlease see my own answer below with the XAML code, a screenshot and an explanation.emp  pIt was a little tough to title this one, so let me explain what my issue is.  I have a datagrid that has a defined height, so the scrollbar appears.  I would like to contain the vertical scrollbar to the area that excludes the header.  While it only scrolls the data rows and not the header, visually it covers the entire datagrid area to the right.  The problem with that is that two boxes appear one above and below at the scrollbar area.  Im not sure how to get rid of them or how to contain the scrollbar to the body of the datagrid.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comayUUU.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe only thing Ive been able to figure out and I dont like the look of it is to set the Background of the DataGrid to Transparent. Heres the outcomep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNNKYG.jpg altenter image description herep  pAs you see, the scrollbar is sticking out annoyingly. Then, theres also the problem of a gap between the horizontal scrollbar and the last row if the background is transparentp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comi1kTl.jpg altenter image description herep  pTheres also a solution that gets rid of the background color of the datagrid for those two boxes, making them stand out lessp  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS9fc4252b38b143698d76b6c5ae1e4df5howtoremovetheblankspaceabovetheverticalscroolbarofdatagridinwpfforumwpf relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS9fc4252b38b143698d76b6c5ae1e4df5howtoremovetheblankspaceabovetheverticalscroolbarofdatagridinwpfforumwpfap  pSimilar solution can be found here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12373248annoyingsquarewherescrollbarsmeetAnnoying Square Where Scrollbars Meetap  pHowever, it doesnt get rid of the problem that the scrollbar is awkwardly sticking out on the side.p  pSomething I tested was to separate header from the body and place the body into a vertical ScrollViewer, then place the header and the body into a horizontal ScrollViewer so that they can be both scrolled horizontally.  But, as you imagine, this doesnt work out well, because you have to scroll to the right to see the verticall scrollbar.  Im sure theres a way to make it so that it stays frozen on the right, but I havent figured it out.  Another issue is the fact the header width has to match the largest possible width of any cell in that column, or everything will be off.  Heres the outcome shown when scrolled all the way to the rightp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYoELu.jpg altenter image description herep  pIm very new to control templates, so I cant figure out if this could work, because I cant find the right componentsp  pIf I give the vertical scrollbar a negative margin to the left say 6,0,0,0 and a similarly sized padding to the right of the cell block 0,0,6,0, the vertical scrollbar technically should move to the left.  I will continue experimenting and try to figure this out, unless someone has the answer for me which would be awesome.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pWell, I made some progress and was able to set the margin of the scrollbar to 17,0,0,0.  17 appears to be the width of the scrollbar.  There appears to be a specific key for its width p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.systemparameters.verticalscrollbarwidthkeyvvs.110.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.systemparameters.verticalscrollbarwidthkeyvvs.110.aspxap  pbut I cant figured out a way to insert that as the negative offset value in the margin within XAML.

Ive been messing with all of them and no luck thus far.  Ill update as soon as I get it, unless someone figures it out before me.  As it stands now, scrollbar will overlay anything in that last column until I fix the offset.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong p  pPlease refer to the updated XAML code above.  What I did was add Margin0,0,17,0 to ScrollContentPresenter. p  pOne side effect effect, which I can completely live with, is the fact that offsets the header as well, but you dont see that until you scroll all the way to the right.  It effects only the header of the last column, because the ScrollContentPresenter offsets it as well... strangely, since there is a DataGridColumnHeadersPresenter, but it works independently... so, Ill keep on working on it. ScrollContentPresenter, unfortunately, doesnt have padding, which would work like a charm.  So, now I have to figure out how I can pad it, rather than setting a margin, or figure out a different method.p  pA similar method is to set the margin of the horizontal ScrollBar thats the one in the second grid to 0,0,17,0.  Itll move it 17 units to the right.  Then, set the margin of DataGridColumnHeaderPresenter to 0,0,17,0.  Itll move it 17 units to the right.p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pHeres another method for anyone thats interestedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4j0tx.jpg altenter image description herep  pSet the margin of vertical ScrollBar to 0,22,0,17.  22 is the height of my headers, so adjust it to whatever yours are.  This method stretches the scrollbar to cover the two white boxes.p  pstrongEDIT 4strongp  pI figured out the solution.  Please see my answer for the XAML code, a screenshot and an explanation.p

Negative 390 pive been making google searches about my question for 2 days but im done with it. I have very basic information about process management, fork etc. Ive been told to create some children processes of a same parent process and send them seeds by using pipes so they can produce some random numbers, all for their own. But Im stuck at creating children processes.p  precodefor i  0 i lt NUMPLAYERS i       TODO spawn the processes that simulate the players      switchpid  fork         case 1   ERROR             exitEXITFAILURE          case 0   CHILD PROCESS             printfMy parent id is d n, getppid             exitEXITSUCCESS          default  PARENT PROCESS             waitNULL       codepre  pWhen I go with this code, parent creates codeNUMPLAYERScode children but I cant seem to use them in another for loop since they had terminated at the end of the case 0. When I just remove codeexitEXITSUCCESScode line, so many processes are created and they have all different parents. So my question is, how to properly create children processes and use them laterp

Negative 390 pI want to be able to change the taskbar button image to a custom image instead of the default Java image.p
Negative 390 pOn a certain site I need to count the amount of times some image are displayed. This is solved by directing the image src to a php script that does the counting and then redirects to the actual image using 302. The script part works fine and is launched every time the image is requested, but Im not sure if the output image is cached by the browser or how to check if it is. My current assumption is that the is not cached because it was pointed by the 302 redirect.p  pIdeally it would be perfect if I could achieve this resultp  ol liImage is requested via url with php scriptli liThe script does a 302 redirect to the actual imageli liThe browser recognizes the address of the 302 redirect and loads cached imageli ol  pI guess it would depend on the browser, but is it even possible to achieve this resultp  pP.S. Its more of a theoretical question, as it wont matter much for my particular problem the images are quite small.p  hr  pI did what CBroe suggested and now I know that it works how I wanted it to at least in Firefox. The browser is smart enough to load the cached version of images even if I redirect to them from my script via 302.p

For example I can use the blue color for the control with the focus and other color for the others controls, to indicate that this others controls have not the focus, but change the color for one more visible.p  pThanks.p
Negative 390 pI am trying to implement kmeans algorithm for a certain Music Recommendation System in Java.br I have generated 2 arrays,codeplaysFinal[]codethe total playcount of an artist by all users in the dataset and codeartFinal[]code the unique artists in the entire dataset .

Negative 390 pI want to know if its OK to have multiple SFTP simultaneous connections for just one user. I built a service to download  upload files to a specific SFTP server. This service has 4 tasks running, all dealing with this SFTP server and all using the same credentials. To prevent any possible issues, I created a singleton class to upload  download the files. Im trying to separate the tasks into different standalone Windows services, to prevent stopping all tasks if one of them fails this does happen, due to timeouts.

Today when I began to work on it everything worked fine and the only thing I changed on the website that could affect the page itself  all pages that the website contains is the navigation bar that I edited when I added a simple green button, that when I delete it will not fix the error. Ive been searching and testing for days and cant find the solution.p  pWhenever I view the error logs there is one simple error p  blockquote   pReferenceError  is not defined index.php110p blockquote  pthat refers to p  precodeltscript typetextjavascript gt         document.readyfunction              .carousel.carousel          ltscriptgt  codepre  pwhich should only affect the home page as this file is not called on any other part of the website.p  pHowever, as I dont know where to start searching in the code for this error, I cant really post the whole code here. However it can be viewed on the link above. Im actually just searching for a position to start fixing or looking for some typos or whatever, but I got confused because it worked before I added a PHPscript which doesnt affect the websites state at all.p  pAny clues Thanks for answers.p

Negative 390 pIm having trouble getting Ringo.JS to print unicode characters. My runtime environment is cygwin. Ive boiled it down to a oneline program see below that exhibits the problem. The codecatcode indicates my terminal is capable of displaying the unicode text, but ringo does not. Im wondering if the ringo shell script is somehow being executed in a nonunicode conformant way, but Im not fluent in the ways of codeexeccodeing shells. much less in knowing why some methods may or may not have unicode support.p  pIs there a way to get ringo to print unicode correctly in cygwinp  precode cat unicodeTest.js print   console.log    ringo unicodeTest.js    ringo version RingoJS version 0.10  which ringo cygdrivecbinringojs0.10binringo codepre  pUPDATEp  pOut of curiosity I tried redirecting the output to a file and checking it. There is definitely something wrong with the way ringo is running in my terminal, because the terminal can print unicode and ringo processes unicode correctly, but ringo wont print unicode in the terminal. Does anyone know what might cause thisp  precode ringo unicodeTest.js  gt output.text    cat output.text  codepre  pUPDATE 2p  pIt appears that ringo for windows is not built to support utf8 in console IO. However, node.js works. I switched to a different machine running a different version of windows and got similar results.p  precode cat utf8test.js console.log ,    ringo utf8test.js ,   node utf8test.js ,  codepre  pSo bottom line, if you want to write a JavaScript program to do utf8 on the console in windows, then the solution is to use node.js and not ringojs. The node.js devs have added blocking IO versions of a lot of the API c.f. fs.readFile vs. fs.readFileSync, so you can pick the IO model that suits your needs.p

Im thinking it may be an x loads before y and therefore it sees the value as undefined, since I am passing in the value attribute by an angularJS data binding. But Im trying to handle it to no avail. Any thoughts on thisp
Negative 390 pI inherited an MVC app with jQuery and Kendo. Most of the controller actions have the [Authorize] attribute and it handles the redirection to the Login page nicely if the user is not already authenticated.p  pHowever, theres one feature that requires some additional information before the action is invoked. So, when the button for that feature is clicked, a Kendo window is displayed asking the user for a DateTime input. Then the action is called with that extra piece of input data, and the user is sent to another page after the action completes with the result of that action.p  pHeres the simplified code flowp  precodebtnClickedListener      Popup Kendo window for DateTime input      Get URL for action Url.ActionMyAction1, MyController, new  date  [DateTime input]       .ajax     datatype json,     url finalUrl,     cache false,      success function result          window.location.href  window.location.origin  MyControllerMyAction2planId  result      ,      error function xhr, error, message          handleErrorxhr, error, message       codepre  pThis works fine if the user is already logged in. But if the user is not already logged in, heres what happensp  ul liKendo window popups for DateTime input.li liLogin page is displayed since MyAction1 has the [Authorize] attribute.li liUser logs in.li liPage MyControllerMyAction2planId is invalid, since MyAction1 never gets hit, and so resultnull.li ul  pHow can I fix this where the Javascript code can detect whether the user is logged in or not, and direct him to the Login page insteadp  pI do not want to hide the button if the user is not authenticated. I want to let the user be able to click on the button, but get redirected instead.p  pThanks for any helpp

It also works fine after a page refresh. p  pAlso, I do not have this issue in IE11, only Chrome I havent tested other browsers yet.  p  pI have tried wrapping the code in both codewindow.loadcode and codedocument.readycode event handlers, but this didnt help.p  pThe site in action can be found at a hrefhttpwww.rhythmrandomizer.com relnofollowhttpwww.rhythmrandomizer.comap  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  pBelow is the relevant codep  pEvent handler for the buttonp  precoderandomize.clickfunction     get general options from form     var timeSignature  timeSignature.val     var phraseLength  phraseLength.val      get note options from form     var checked  []     noteOptions checked.eachfunction          checked.pushthis.val           alert user and exit function if nothing is selected     if checked.length lt 1          alertPlease select at least one note value         return            format note option ids into a delimited string     var noteOptions       for var i0 i lt checked.length i          noteOptions  checked[i]  a           remove the final comma and space     noteOptions  noteOptions.substr0, noteOptions.length  1      ajax call     .ajaxrandomize.php,          data               timeSignature  timeSignature,             phraseLength  phraseLength,             noteOptions  noteOptions         ,         type  GET,         success  functionresponse              rhythm.htmlresponse             scaleRhythm         ,         error  functionxhr, status, errorThrown              console.logstatus      errorThrown                 codepre  pThe php file that returns the rhythm notationp  precodeltphp MySQL connection variables hostname  localhost user  inigetmysqli.defaultuser pw  inigetmysqli.defaultpw database  rhytxfpdrhythmrandomizer  Connect to database try      db  new PDOmysqlhost . hostname . dbname . database,user,pw  catchPDOException e      echo egtgetMessage     die   Get values from GET timeSignature  GET[timeSignature] phraseLength  GET[phraseLength] noteOptString  GET[noteOptions]  Split up note options string noteOptions  explodea, noteOptString  Create sql query sql  SELECT             noteName,             noteValue,             noteGraphic         FROM             notes         WHERE  append noteOptions as WHERE clauses foreach noteOptions as opt      sql  sql .  noteGroupID   . opt .

Negative 390 pI am new to ObjectiveC, but have some programming knowledge. So I followed Todd Perkins tutorial on making a notes application on Lynda.com. To get more familiar with ObjectiveC, I am wanting to add things to this notes app to learn more, but Im kind of stuck. p  pCurrently, the notes app is built in a Master Detail application template. So there is a Table View in the MasterDetailView controller, and a detail view in the DetailViewController. When a user taps the add button, it segues to the Detail controller and there is a UITextField that you type into and when you click Back, it saves that UITextField to NSUserDefaults, and thats what is used to populate the cell in the Table View.p  pSo basically, what I have done is add a UITextView for another spot in the Detail View. But I cant figure out the best way to save that the same way the title of the note is saved. Obviously, each one needs to be different for each note.

So the matrix size would be coden x summaskcode.p  pExample in my code, the structure is not built in this way, of course  p  precodevec  rand1000,1 S.f1  vec S.f2  vec S.f3  vec S.f4  vec S.f5  vec  mask  [false true true false false]  5 elements because S has 5 fields codepre  pThe expected output would bep  precodeoutput  [S.f2 S.f3] codepre  pBut of course, the creation of codeoutputcode should depend dynamically on the fields of codeScode and on codemaskcode. p  pIs there any way to achieve this emwithoutem using an ugly construction including a filter of the struct field names, loop, etc.p  pThank you very muchp  pPhilipp

However, I would like to extract in the following triples dataset format p  ol liCheesyPizza1 subclass Pizza1li liPizza1 hastopping CheeseTopping1li ol  passuming that Pizza1 is a dynamic instantiation not the true individual of the Pizza class in the ontology but just a random variable while writing in the triples format of Pizza class and similarly, CheesyPizza1 is a dynamic instantiation of CheesyPizza class and CheeseTopping1 is a dynamic instantiation of CheeseTopping class.p  pHow can I get the above representationp
Negative 390 pThis is more of a Java concurrency design question. Im working on an application that need to process many messages for many different clients. If two messages have different client names, then they can be processed in parallel. However, if they have the same client name, then they need to be processed in order serially. p  pWhats the best way to implement this p  pMy current implementation is pretty simple I wrote a wrapper class called OrderedExecutorPool. It has a list of singlethreaded executors. In its submit method, it does the following to figure out which executor to submit the task to p  precodeint executorNum  Math.absclientName.hashCode  numExecutors executorList.getexecutorNum.submittask codepre  pThis ensures that all messages with same clients go to the same executor while still supporting processing messages for different clients in parallel. p  pThere are a couple of problems with this designp  p1. If most client names have same hash code, then only a few executors are doing workp  p2. If one client has MANY messages, only one executor may not keep up p  pIs there an elegant solution to this problem that can fix the shortcomings above p  pstrongEditstrong clientName is just a String. Im just invoking the String.hashCode method on it. p

Negative 390 pI am new to Extjs and I am looking to use the MVC pattern to use Openlayers. The problem I am having is that the Openlayers sources can never be found. I have imported the ol.js file in my html via  tags and tried Ext.Loader and Ext.Require, but every time senchaprecompile runs, it says Cant find variable ol. p  pI also have a fair bit of existing infrastructure consisting of js files containing objectsclasses that I have tried to import but receive the same errors. The Openlayers case is a more specific scenario of trying to use externalexisting javascript infrastructure in Extjs.p  pAnybody had similar issuesknow a solutionp  pI am starting to wonder if I want the use Extjs then all of my existing libraries or any libraries that I want to interface to in the future need to be extjsified first before they can be used. This would be very undesirable if true.p  pUsing GeoExt is out of the question as it does not use Openlayers 3.0.p

So, once a program runs, stack frames are made in the stack for current executing functions, and in these stack frames all the variables are in 0s and 1s, but whats inside the text segmentp

Were looking at what they are viewing, how long they are viewing it, their click paths, we also have AB tests running for certain pages and were detecting which pages are firing throughout the user viewing cycle and were tracking some other information that is custom and were not able to put this into a google analytics API and pull this information out. Once theyve navigated the site, were thing using this information to build user profiles for every session on the site. We essentially need to then detect which of these sessions is actually real and give the site owners the ability to view the data along with our data mining application to analyze the data and provide feedback to the site owners on certain criteria to help them better their website from these profiles. If you have a better way of doing this, were all ears. p
Negative 390 pI have an codeNSOperationcode and in the codecompletionblockcode I do some time consuming saving to CoreData. The actual operation runs fast.

However the operation is run within a singleton and another class needs to run the queue thats why I need to cancel the codecompletionblockcode. Any ideas on how I can cancel the codecompleteionblockcodep

away, Ive given the layout beneath the same background color, Ive increased the ListViews height to fillparent ANYTHING I change regarding this messes up my entire layout.p  pHere is a screenshot depicting what goes wrong img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBFuOg.png altenter image description herep  pThe view itself doesnt look so bad but the ListView is gone or so I originally thought but it still functions normally...p  pp  pI gave the RelevantLayout a slightly transparent background and I can see that the ListView is being overlapped by this Layout.p  pPlease help me figure out why the zorder is changing or to help me figure out the cause of this its way more frustrating than it needs to be.p  pstrongslidingmenu.xmlstrongp  precode    ltFrameLayout

Negative 390 pFor talking sakes lets say youve got 5 floats, which are all stored in a single float and are all positions of an image.

Right now Im using a NSPredicate to see if there is any numbers equal to 500, however I cannot seem to use the one if statement to do this. The reason why Im using one if statement to do this because Ill have to do loads of if statements examplep  precodeifObjectOne.center.y  500  ObjectOne.center  CGPointMake225, ObjectOne.center.y   ifObjectTwo.center.y  500  ObjectTwo.center  CGPointMake225, ObjectTwo.center.y  ect... codepre  pWhere as this is one if statement for them all, however I dont know how to finish it.p  precodevoidPosition  ObjectOne.center  CGPointMake0, 500 ObjectFour.center  CGPointMake 0, 500 NSNumber one  [NSNumber numberWithFloatObjectOne.center.y] NSNumber two  [NSNumber numberWithFloatObjectTwo.center.y] NSNumber three  [NSNumber numberWithFloatObjectThree.center.y] NSNumber four  [NSNumber numberWithFloatObjectFour.center.y] NSNumber five  [NSNumber numberWithFloatObjectFive.center.y]  NSMutableSet set  [NSMutableset setWithObjectsone, two, three, four, five, nil] [self checking]   voidChecking  NSPredicate pre pre  [NSPredicte predicateWithFormatSELF  i, 500] [set filterUsingPredicatepre] line not working ifpre  true find which objects are equal and move them  have no clue how to do this       codepre  pI know NSPredicate is probably the wrong way to go, so is there anything like it which will solve this problem.

Negative 390 pI am trying to create a GUI based on QTableView which has information in several rows. These rows are dragable.p  pThe challenge I am facing is I have to highlight the row which I pull for dragging, it should be highlighted all the time when I am continuing to drag, the highlight should go away when I take the dragged item out of the widget, BUT now if I bring it back in the widget it should remember which row was picked and should highlight it again. If user throws the dragged item outside the widget I have to forget about it.p  pI have reimplementedp  pdragEnterEvent This guy highlights the drag start row  i am saving this row number  only if this row does not exist  i am using boost optional for this row number p  pdropEvent this guy makes drag start row boostnone  means the variable does not have any value p  pWhen user starts dragging, takes the dragged item outside widget and then again brings it back,  that means dragstart  dragmoved  dragleave  dragstart happens , So I know which row to highlight  since I have saved this info while dragstart p  pIt works fine till this point.p  pBUT WHAT IF USER DROPS IT OUTSIDE WIDGET AND TRIES TO DRAG SOME ROW AGAIN  previous row number was still saved and now it highlights the previously dragged row. This is the bad case  p  pThe cleanest solution I could think of is to somehow detect when the item was dropped  even it was dropped outside widget , but seems like that is not possible.p  pI will appreciate if someone can read this long problem and can suggest some solution.p

Negative 390 pI have a developed a binary extension that works fine under Firefox, but cannot manage to deploy it in XULRunnerGeckoFX.

But by using GeckoFX, XULRunner is running embedded in my project, so I dont have a XULRunner application.p  pIve already tried copying the installed extensions directory from Firefoxs profile directory to XULRunners profile, and also to use the FF profile directory for GeckoFX, both to no avail.p  pMy current suspicion is that the extensions codetargetApplicationcode in codeinstall.rdfcode needs to be adjusted for GeckoFX, but whats the correct idp  pSince we are deploying GeckoFXXULRunner embedded in our project, I dont need the extension manager, a static deployment would be enough.p

Negative 390 pI am working with an embedded box that must be able to communicate with traditional computers using UDP.  When the box sends large UDP messages that need to be fragmented, a UDP header is included for each fragment.  Thus if I want to a send a large datagram, it will be fragmented like thisp  precode[eth hdr][ip hdr][udp hdr][    data 1    ]  first fragment  [eth hdr][ip hdr][udp hdr][    data 2    ]  second fragment  [eth hdr][ip hdr][udp hdr][  data 3  ]      last fragment  codepre  pI understand that this is not customary, as usually the udp header would only be included in only the first ip packet of the fragmented message.  However, this works perfectly for communicating with the other machines I need to talk to ex. using recvfrom, so I have no reason to dig in and try to change it.p  pMy issue, however, is in reading messages.  The box seems to expect fragmented udp datagrams to be sent to it in the same manner.  By this I mean that it expects every ipv4 fragment to have a udp header.  Before trying to change this its a rather specialized and complicated platform I would like to know if there is any way to configure sendto or any other such function for sending udp messages in this format.  I see when monitoring the traffic that those udp headers arent present.p  pThank you very much for the help.p

Negative 390 pI have an application that allows users to upload contents to Amazon S3, and returns the link of the uploaded content.  I have been wondering how to allow only users that own the content to access it, and i got into a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAmazonS3latestAPIsigv4authusingauthorizationheader.html relnofollowhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAmazonS3latestAPIsigv4authusingauthorizationheader.htmla the authorization header. p  pA way to use it i thought is generating a link to my application host for each content e.g from bucket.s3.amazonaws.com29347524.jpg to  myapp.comimage154155.jpg and serve it to user. When i receive a request ill be checking if the user is authenticated in my application or not, and in successful match ill allegate the authorization header to the request and forward it to amazon. p  pI would like not to download the content from amazons server from my applications server and serve the content to the client. I think this is a useless waste of band. Is there maybe any way to forward the request after adding some headers So that the client is answered by Amazon when he requests the content but the request is made to my server and modified in some parts.p  pDo you know any other way to perform an authentication like this on Amazons S3 content  Any suggestion will be appreciatedp

Negative 390 pIm writing some asynchronous IO stuff in C, and I need to prevent an object from being destructed until its handler for the asynchronous IO is called. Im trying to use codesharedptrcode and create my object with a static constructor so I can be sure that it is using reference counting.

Negative 390 pIm working on a Java RCP project in which I need to convert different source file formats lets call them SF1..N to another two different destination formats DFA, DFB Right now the input files can be CSVs, XLSXs and XMLs with different schemas. The application should find the right converter and its necessary to read the file content to do that. Each converter normalizes the content of the file and creates 1..N instances of an DF objects that get converted to either DFA or DFB record.p  pSo I have a few converters that get the file content and return a collection of DFs objects. Each converter should also be able to tell if the file content is the one it supports.p  pThe only strategy I can think of is asking each converter if it supports the content of the file and if it doesnt try the next one. If there no converter suitable, return an error to the user.p  pIts also likely Ill be asked to add support fromto new formats and Id like to be able to add more converters without modifying unnecessary code.p  pIm thinking about registering each converter in a servicelocator object but Im not sure how to do that with minimal coupling. I thought about registering to the service locator in the static initializer but that gets called only after loading the class.p  pHow can I do that Is there a better approach for what I want to accomplishp

Negative 390 pIve written an application using restkit that makes a request from a webservice that I do not control. This webservice does not seem to implement any of the caching headers that RestKit relies on.p  pIn order to work around this I figured I would create a new field on my managedObject called requestDate and test that before making a request.

Negative 390 pIn an interactive comic book I am working on for the iPad, I have flip book style animation with sound sync on some of the pages.p  pI have created precise sound sync by using NSTimer for both the sound files wav and the graphic files .png.p  pThere is one problem and I will explain with code...p  pI turn the page and the animation starts up right away complete with sound. But lets say that the user doesnt want to watch the whole thing EG. they have seen it already and they want to flip to a pervious page for some reason. Well they can without difficulty, but the sounds triggered by the NSTimer code keeps on playing after the page is turned. This looks amp sounds lame I want it to stop if the user leaves that page.

As pointed out by Marc van Leeuwen, codeptr[0]code is equivalent to codeptr  0code, however codeptr  0code seems to fall foul of the pointer arithmetic section.

Negative 390 pHi im trying to sort an array based on the number of occurrences of the value in the array. So if my array codeint[] a  new int[]9,2,4,8,9,4,3,2,8,1,2,7,2,5codemy array count should be count[i1] and based on the value of the array my count array looks like this code1 4 1 2 1 0 1 2 2code so codecount[0]  1code stores the count for 1. codecount[1] 4code and stores the count for 2, codecount[2]  1codestores the count for 3, and codecount[8] 2code stores the number of occurrences for 9. My count should be codecount[i1]code to store the number of the number of occurrences and based on the number of occurrences i should sort the array. First question, i am having trouble storing the counts of occurrences of the array a into the count array. And based on the number of occurrences how do i go about storing the array.p

Ip addresses of emdiagnostic programem and hardware equipment are predefined and must be unchanged, diagnostic program await only predefined hardware ip addresses.br Ip address of diagnostic program is 192.168.1.11, hardware equipments  192.168.1.200, 192.168.1.201, etc.  p  precode         [server]     ltgt [hw client1]                         192.168.1.200     diagnostic            program               192.168.1.11 ltgt [hw client2]           192.168.1.201                            codepre  pHardware currently implements part of internal protocol and emdiagnostic programem works fine. I want to improve emdiagnostic programem and implement next part of internal protocol without hardware equipment its software not ready. To do this I want to implement software emulator to work as hardware. My plan is to create strongtcpClientstrong, which implements internal protocol used in interaction between emdiagnostic programem and hardware equipment.br The problem is that I cannot set arbitrary ip address to strongtcpClientstrong. I can only work through stronglocalhoststrong.br Is it possible to create program which will implement strongtcpClientstrong with desired ip address for example 192.168.1.200p

Negative 390 pemNote I have found questions regarding the type casting with the IBinder and Binder but they focus on fixing issues.

Negative 390 pSo, lets say I want to recode some PNG to JPEG in Java. The image has extreme resolution, lets say for example 10 000 x 10 000px. Using standard Java image API Writers and Reader, you need at some point to have entire image decoded in RAM, which takes extreme amount of RAM space hundreds of MB. I have been looking how other tools do this, and I found that ImageMagick uses disk pixel storage, but this seems to by way too slower for my needs. So what I need is tru streaming recoder. And by true streaming I mean read and process data by chuncks or bins, not just give stream as input but decode it whole beforehand.p  pNow,  first the theory behind  is it even possible, given JPEG and PNG algorithms, to do this using streams, or lets say in bins of data So there is no need to have entire image encoded in memoryor other storage In JPEG compression, first few stages could be done in streams, but I believe Huffman encoding needs to build entire tree of value probabilities after quantization, therefore it needs to analyze whole image  so whole image needs to be decoded beforehand, or somehow on demand by regions.p  pAnd the golden question, if above could be achieved, is there any Java library that can actually work in this way And save large amount of RAMp

Negative 390 pI am developing UI for my watch app. I have a Home Interface Controller, and when a push notification arrives, a second Modal Interface Controller should show up. p  pI dragged the two interface controllers onto the storyboard. Usually, if there is a buttontable cell etc on a controller, a modal segue can be created by dragging from the button to the modal controller. Since my modal controller is not presented by interacting with a button, but rather by responding to a push notification, I decided to present the modal controller programatically. I cant seem to find a way to create a modal segue without a button in storyboard. Directly dragging from one controller to the other only presented me with the option of a next page segue, but no modal segue.p  pHowever, if I do it in code, a warning will be shown in the storyboard saying my modal controller is unreachable. From the storyboard the modal controller does seem standalone and detached, but I am presenting it in code. Is there a way to make the warning go awayp

After arriving at DCA, I   discovered to my dismay that the suitcase I had checked in at Tel Aviv was not on my flight. I spent 5 hours at   Pearson trying to sort out the mess resulting from the bumped connection.   First time in 40 years to fly with Air Canada. We loved the slightly wider seats. Disappointed in no movies to   watch as not all travelers have iphones etc. Also, on our trip down my husband asked twice for coffee, black. He   did not get any and was not offered anything else. On our trip home, I asked for a black coffee. She said she was   making more as several travelers had asked. I did not my coffee or anything else to drink. It was a long trip with   nothing to drink especially when they had asked. When trying to get their attention, they seemed to avoid my   tries. We found the two female stewardesss not very friendly. It may seem a small thing but very frustrating for   a traveler.   Painless checkin. Two legs of 3 on AC AC105, YYZYVR. Roomy and clean A321 with fantastic crew. AC33 YVRSYD,   very light load and had 3 seats to myself. A very enthusiastic and friendly crew as usual on this transpacific   route that I take several times a year. Arrived 20 min ahead of schedule. The expected high level of service from   our flag carrier, Air Canada. Altitude Elite member. p blockquote  pThey are airline reviews, each review separated by a . I would like to take all of the reviews and put them in one data.frame in R, but each review should get its own slot or position. The codecode is intended to be the separator. p

Negative 390 pI want to create a text file that is essentially a dictionary, with each word being paired with its vector representation through word2vec.

For example when I wrote the following to remove a dept and its emp childp  precodepublic ActionResult Index2              var dept  t.Depts.Includewgtw.Emps.SingleOrDefaulta gt a.DeptID  1          t.Depts.Removedept         t.SaveChanges         return Contentsucces      codepre  pThen EF will NOT try to remove the related Emps, instead it will only try to set the Emp.DeptID FK as null, and since the FK is required I get the following exceptionp  precodeThe operation failed The relationship could not be changed because one or more of the foreignkey properties is nonnullable. When a change is made to a relationship, the related foreignkey property is set to a null value. If the foreignkey does not support null values, a new relationship must be defined, the foreignkey property must be assigned another nonnull value, or the unrelated object must be deleted. codepre  pBy default EF will do Cascade on delete when trying to delete a parent object that has children in a manytomany relation and i am retrieving the child records using .Include. When I wrote the followingp  precodepublic ActionResult Index4              Account acc  t.Accounts             .Includeagta.Emps             .FirstOrDefault         t.Accounts.Removeacc         t.SaveChanges         return Contentsucces      codepre  pThen EF removes the Account and the related AccountEmp rows but did not remove the Emp objects themselves.p  pSo I have the following 4 questionsp  p1.Can I conclude that EF will implement Set Null as the Delete rule for a onetomany relation, when i try to remove a parent object and i am retrieving the child records using code.Includecode 2.And will it implement Cascade as the delete rule for a manytomany,when i try to remove a parent object and i am retrieving the child records using code.Includecode, but without removing the Emps in my casep  p3.If I write the followingp  precode  public ActionResult Index2                      var emp  t.Emps.Includewgtw.Dept.SingleOrDefaulta gt a.EmpID  1              t.EMPs.Removeemp             t.SaveChanges             return Contentsucces          codepre  pthis will never affect the Dept. So when I try to remove a child, then EF will never try to remove its parentp  p4.If I want to remove the related Emps when I remove an Account, how can I do so using EF Currently if I remove an Account, and I load the EMPs navigation property using .Include this will result in removing the Account amp the AccountEMP rows but will never affect the related EMP. Unlike setting the FK Delete rule as Cascade on the database schema, where setting this at the DB level will result in removing the AccountEMP amp the EMP rows when removing the Account, so can I get this inside EFp  pbaring in mind that for all the above scenario i am using the default End1 delete amp End2 delete to be none inside the Model Browser. and also i did not specify any Delete constraints on the DB..  strongMy question is how EF works when i am specifying what to delete by loading the related child objects using code.Includecode on class basisstrongp

Negative 390 pI am trying to implement a method level cache in OSGI services using the EventListenerHook and FindHook. The idea is a few services deemed cacheable will be proxied and if the method is deemed cacheable the service is proxied. Any other service that needs a cacheable service will now get an instance of proxy. With in the proxy I do the cache lookup and if not found entry added to cache.p  pIt all works very well for simple services. The problem starts when I have a service with a list of configurable properties metatypetrue managed via ConfigAdmin.p  pWhat exactly happens when I update a property in Configuration Admin in Felix console A new service is registered in Service Registry I was under the impression, no service event is triggered. Only the activatemodifieddeactivate method in the service is invoked. Is my understanding incorrectp  pThanks Jaip

Negative 390 pMy question seems to be rather simple to me yet I am not sure if what I am trying to do is even possible and have not found any info on it.

They are linked to a desktop access database that populates most of them with the exception of the first one listed below Entries that is populated using an infopath form on sharepoint. This list containsp  pstrongEntriesstrong   ResourceID   ProjectID   PositionID   and a few additional fields that contain numbersp  pThen the other 3 lists includep  pstrongResourcesstrong   ResourceID   ResourceNamep  pstrongProjectsstrong   ProjectID   ProjectNamep  pstrongPositionsstrong   PositionID   PositionTitlep  pI am trying to create a view of entries that displays ResourceName  ProjectName  PositionTitle  and the extra number fields in Entries. It seems that I should be able to do this using lookup fields but I dont know how to get it to reference the proper ID number in the lists. I can add a lookup field into Entries that looks up the field ResourceName and ResourceID but I dont know how to establish the relationship between the IDs. I have only ever succesfully established relationships when creating new lists, not ones that are already built. I am starting to think I am going about this in the wrong way, but it seems to me that this is what lookups are for so I might just be missing something.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and thanks to anyone who might be able to offer me some insight on what I am doing wrong.p

Negative 390 pi have a website that uploads files through blueimp fileupload plugin and in backend the file is first transferred to the server and then finally to s3 Bucket. Now recently my users started to complain of slow uploads. I started debugging the issue, as there could be many problems here as slow upload to server or slow upload to s3 bucket, but to my suprise the problem was in the step where the form is submitted to the controller for processing the file to upload to s3. p  pOnce the form was submitted, the backend process was very fast. I think that the browser is taking a lot of time in making the post request for that form. As it converts the pdf document to base64 and add it into the request headers.p  pIf this is the issue, please post possible solutions or if you see any other issues with this, please do post.p

Ive also additionally discovered that bitstrings of length codencode bits where codencode is not a multiple of 8 CHARBIT, the number of bits in a byte lose the least significant bits from the least significant byte. For example, if my bitstring is 14 bits, then 2 bytes 16 bits are needed to store the bitstring, with byte zero being most significant and byte 1 being least. We lose bits 0 and 1 the two least significant bits from the least significant byte, namely byte 1.

Negative 390 pLadies and Gents, p  pGenerally, Im pretty awesome when it comes to VBA in Excel, Word or Powerpoint.  However, this one has me stumpedp  pBasic idea of what I am doing...  I want to use Excel to store tag names in column A and their associated replacement text in Column B.  When the code runs, it needs to collect each tag, one at a time row by row, search an entire Word document for those words, and replace them with their corresponding replacements.  I had this all working, or so I thought, until I noticed that the special tags in the headers and footers werent being replaced.  So, I turned to this artical a hrefhttpword.mvps.orgfaqscustomizationReplaceAnywhere.htm relnofollowhttpword.mvps.orgfaqscustomizationReplaceAnywhere.htma and found that working with a range of ranges or cycling through all available Story Ranges in the document I was able to do this.  So, I improved my code, just like it was recommended in the link above and it worked, so long as my code was embedded in my Normal word file, thereby using my VBA code from Word to operate on another Word document.  However, the goal is to use VBA Excel to operate the replacements while reading an Excel file.  When I moved the code to Excel, it seems as if it isnt quite working and Im getting hung up on an Automation error which reads, Runtime error 2147319779 8002801d Automation error  Library not registered..
