Positive 531 pI have either an Excel question or a database question.  The reason why it might be either is because, even if the data is entered into an Excel or cvs, it will be imported into a database.  p  pTherefore, it may be more efficient to directly create the records in the database.p  pA quick overview of the use case.  Our company has picked up 1200 store locations.  We are installing equipment in monthly waves of 100.  p  pOnce we install a store, they pay a Install Fee.  p  pAlso, once we install a store, they will begin paying a license fee for that month, and every month thereafter.p  pEach store is going to be assigned a Store ID, and every Install Fee and every License payment the store makes will be recorded, as well as the date.p  pTherefore, for the year, we should have 1200 Store IDs.p  pEach Store ID will have one Install Fee record, so there will be 1200 Install Fee records total.p  pFor License Payments, there will be 100 stores who will make 12 License payments the 100 installed in January, 100 stores will make 11 License payments the 100 installed in February, etc. It comes out to 7800 License Payment records.p  pSo, in total with the Install Payments, there are 9000 records.p  pstrongStore ID scriptstrong I would like to create a script to create Store IDs automatically, according to the following format  The first letter of the ID is J and then a fourdigit number, starting with 0001 and working up.

Negative 531 pIm developing a system that allows developers to upload custom groovy scripts and freemarker templates.p  pI can provide a certain level of security at a very high level with the default Java security infrastructure  i.e. prevent code from accessing the filesystem or network, however I have a need to restrict access to specific methods.p  pMy plan was to modify the Groovy and Freemarker runtimes to read Annotations that would either whitelist or blacklist certain methods, however this would force me to maintain a forked version of their code, which is not desirable.p  pAll I essentially need to be able to do is prevent the execution of specific methods when called from Groovy or Freemarker.

Negative 531 pIn a previous question about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions781442serialiseobjecttoxmldocumentserialising an object to an codeXmlDocumentcode in Ca, I needed to serialise some fault information to an codeXmlDocumentcode that was returned from a asmxstyle webservice call.  On the client I need to deserialise the codeXmlDocumentcode back to an object.p  pThis is straightforward enough if you know the type, but I realised I wanted a flexible approach where the type to deserialise to is also encoded in the codeXmlDocumentcode.  Im currently doing it manually by adding an codeXmlNodecode to the codeXmlDocumentcode that has the type name, calculated as followsp  precode    Type type  fault.GetType     string assemblyName  type.Assembly.FullName       Strip off the version and culture info     assemblyName  assemblyName.Substring0, assemblyName.IndexOf,.Trim      string typeName  type.FullName  ,   assemblyName codepre  pThen on the client I first get this type name back from the codeXmlDocumentcode, and create the type object that is passed into the codeXmlSerialisercode thusp  precode        object fault         XmlNode faultNode  e.Detail.FirstChild         XmlNode faultTypeNode  faultNode.NextSibling           The typename of the fault type is the inner xml of the first node         string typeName  faultTypeNode.InnerXml         Type faultType  Type.GetTypetypeName           The serialised data for the fault is the second node         using var stream  new StringReaderfaultNode.OuterXml                      var serialiser  new XmlSerializerfaultType             objectThatWasSerialised  serialiser.Deserializestream                   return CastToTypefault codepre  pSo this is a bruteforce approach, and I was wondering if theres a more elegant solution that somehow includes the typename of the serialised type automatically, rather than manually recording it elsewherep

Negative 531 pIn my first ASP.NET MVC applications, the model was a simple OR mapping between a table and the classes, managed by the Entity Framework.p  pNow I would like to add some meat to this skeleton, and introduce business methods for the generated classes. What is the recommended approch to this in ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework My favorite would be solution which also can be used in a service layer, with no ASP.NET MVC references, so that the same domain logic also could be reused in a desktop client.p  pTechnically, I think it should be possible to extend the generated classes in a way which preserves the additional business logic even if the OR classes need to be refreshed. This is more a question related to the Entity Framework however.p  pEdit Many thanks for the contributions, and the information about the next version of Entity Framework 4.0. Building two sets of classes, one autogenerated to represent the data in the persistency layer and one for the actual business logic sounds interesting.p

Negative 531 pHope some of you can give some pointers on this one. p  pI generate code where i have to make calls to remote resources like webservices or databases. p  pConsider this piece of code p  precodeclass Parent         IEnumerableltChildgt Children      int SumChildren             note the AsParallel         return Children.AsParallel.Sumc gt c.RemoteCall            class Child              public int RemoteCall           call some webservice. Id like to pool these calls           without having to rewrite the rest of this code        codepre  pFor 50 children, its going to make 50 calls to the service, taking the overhead 50 times. In my real life examples this could easily be a million calls, bringing the whole thing to a crawl. p  pWhat i would like to do is batch these calls in some way that is transparent for the calling threadtask. So instead of calling the service directly, it calls some central queue the  train station that batches these calls.p  pSo that when it does that, the calling task blocks. Then the queue waits for X calls to accumulate and then makes 1 call to the remote service with a list of requests. p  pWhen the result comes this queue returns the return values to the right task and unblocks it. for the calling thread, all this remains hidden and it looks like just another function call.p  pCan this be done Are there primitives in the TPL that will let me do this p  pIt kinda smells like the CCR with lots of things going on at the same time waiting for other stuff to complete.p  pI could of course rewrite this code to make the list of requests on the Parent class and then call the service. The thing is that with my real problem all this code is generated. So I would have to look inside the implementation of Child.RemoteCall, making this all a whole lot more complicated than it already is. Also the the Child could be a proxy to a remote object etc. Would be very hard if doable at all, id rather isolate this complexity.p  pHope this make sense to someone, if not let me know ill elaborate. p
Negative 531 pIm building a clientserver iPhone game, where I would like to keep thirdparty clients from accessing the server. This is for two reasons first, my revenue model is to sell the client and give away the service, and second I want to avoid the proliferation of clients that facilitate cheating. p  pIm writing the first version of the server in rails, but Im considering moving to erlang at some point. p  pIm considering two approachesp  ol lipGenerate a username say, a GUID and hash it SHA256 or MD5 with a secret shipped with the app, and use the result as the password. When the client connects with the server, both are sent via HTTP Basic Auth over https. The server hashes the username with the same secret and makes sure that they match. pli lipShip a client certificate with the iPhone app. The server is configured to require the client certificate to be present. pli ol  pThe first approach has the advantage of being simple, low overhead, and it may be easier to obfuscate the secret in the app. p  pThe second approach is well tested and proven, but might be higher overhead. However, my knowledge of client certificates is at the read about it in the Delta Airlines inflight magazine level. How much bandwidth and processing overhead would this incur The actual data transferred per request is on the order of a kilobyte. p

Negative 531 pThis is a continuation of the question below.p  pBasically I discovered its no problem at all to draw lines or shapes or whatever directly onto an mxText object using its graphics property  Text.graphics.lineTo, etc..  If just displaying that text,  then any such drawn lines are displayed as well.  However, if that Text object is used as a mask,  then any  drawn lines on that text object are merely ignored when the mask is rendered.p  pAnd its hard for me to see the reason behind this, if anyone else is able to.  I mean youre designating the Text object itself as the mask.  It seems like any visual change to that text object should be part of the mask.p

Negative 531 pSlight bit of background Im a Delphi programmer relearning C learned in school originally, havent hardly touched until recently, and am trying to get some of my Delphi concepts transferred over.  p  pThe current situation is, I need to create an application that can use data from a variable list of similar data controls depending on location, need, etc. and in order to display that information in Delphi, I would simply use a scroll box and frames.  The scroll box I can easily replace with the C panel class, but Im not finding anything I can use that will tell me how to create my frame class for use inside the panel.  All I can find is some stuff for web development.p  pCan anyone point me in a good direction for learning the C frame equivalent Thanks.p  pEDITp  pFor nonDelphi programmers, a frame is a formlike control that allows other controls buttons, boxes, grids, etc to be placed on it, then the frame gets used as a control itself on a form to reduce codereuse as all frames do similar functionality and streamline development.

Negative 531 pHas anyone built OpenAL for the Android, or found the shared library for it on the system  This seems like an obvious need for a game of any kind, yet theres no resources out there for it.  It seems the Android java sound library cant do pitch changes from what I can tell, so there seems a need for OpenAL.  I know OpenAL Soft can be built on top of ALSA, but Im not sure if anyones done that, and Im sure it would take me a month.p  pIf theres a good guide somewhere on sound manipulation on the Android without OpenAL, thats fine too.  Its just that OpenAL is sort of a standard for game makers and it would be nice to port my thousands of lines over to this system, which I sort of thought was the point of the NDK before I dugg into it and saw that theres almost no shared library access on the system.p  pThanks..  I hope I can actually port without becoming a java expert myself.  Really disliking the NDK so farp

Negative 531 pIm creating a dataentry application where users are allowed to create the entry schema.p  pMy first version of this just created a single table per entry schema with each entry spanning a single or multiple columns for complex types with the appropriate data type.

I also would like to avoid an xml database as other parts of the application fits better as a relational model, and being able to join the data is helpful.p  pI cannot help to think that someone has solved some of this already, but Im unable to find anything.

Negative 531 pFirst, I chose to do this in Python because I never programmed in it and it would be good practice.p  pSomeone asked me to implement a little combination program that basically outputs all possible combinations of a set of group of numbers. Example, if you have br 1,2,3 as the first set, br 4,5,6 as the second, and br  7,8,9 as the third, then one combination would be 1,4,7 and so on, with a total of 27 possible combinations. This person just wants to do a 6rows x 6cols matrix or a 5rows x 6cols matrix. However, I want to make my little program as flexible as possible. br The next requirement is to only output combinations with X even numbers. If he wants 0 even numbers, then a possible combination would be 1,5,7. You get the idea. For the permutation part, I used itertools.product, which works perfectly. It would be easy if I just assume that the number of numbers in each set cols is fixed as 6.  In that case, I could manually create 6 lists and append each combination to the right list. However and again, I want this to work with N number of cols.p  pIm thinking of 2 ways I might be able to do this, but tried with no luck.

Negative 531 pI feel like I hit a wall trying to structure what I thought would be a simple database schema for modeling basic financial transactions. Im hoping some of you with more experience can weigh in and point me in the right direction.p  pMy application has four distinctly different types of leases that customers can purchase. As such, each type of lease has its own table, and in order to keep referential integrity, each lease table has its own transactions table.p  pMy original sketch looked like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comahkBD.png p  pFirst off, I used a FK reference to Function Types to avoid using signed integers. It makes no sense to have a negative payment, so I figured it would work well for each transaction to have either a debit or credit reference. Does this make sensep  pAnother thing that was bothering me is that all transactions dont appear to be equal. That is, I feel like the transctions for this application should possibly be grouped into separate tables.p  pShould transactions such as flat rate fees, variable rate fees, payments, interest and voids all be stuffed into the same table It seems messy to me, but Im already stuck with a transactions table for each lease type so splitting those tables up even more is not very appealing.p  pJust about every transaction type other than payments will be built programmatically, so I can have references in the Notes field that specifies which payment a bounced check or void transaction is referencing. Is this good enough or am I thinking about this all wrongp  pThanksp

Negative 531 pUsing a custom sensor that I built, I collected pressure sensor information of a the human gait cycle how the pressure varies when a person walks from a persons right foot. One of the things I want to do is break up each signal into individual steps taken by the right foot. I have a couple of sensors on the sole of the foot, but the most important one is the heel sensor since I am using that as the means of understanding the start and end of each step. This is done by looking at all the peaks of the heel sensor since a step in my case is defined as the stuff that happens between two consecutive heel strikes. However, because it is difficult to walk with each step consistently at the same speed, some steps tend to be slightly longer or shorter than others. p  pThis brings me to the question at hand. I want to warp each step so that they are all exactly the same length i.e. I want to warp each step to take the same amount of time, but Im not exactly sure what the best approach is. Can anyone advise me how I can process this single signal, and modify each step so that they are all equal lengths. p

Negative 531 pI have a few questions that are related to this same topic, so I thought it would be nice to ask them in a single thread.  I have perused over some other related topic but havent been able to find quite the answer Im looking for.  In general, most of these seem to be related to security issues. br  My questions are as followsp  ol liI want to access a file, preferable with an XMLHttpRequest object as it is an xml file I wanted to use.  I am using chrome and when I attempt to access the file, I get this as a result in my javascript console br  XMLHttpRequest cannot load filehomelazarusDesktopsitesparserdata.xml.  br  Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP. xmlreqtest.html11Uncaught Error NETWORKERR XMLHttpRequest Exception 101  br  Ive looked over a few other answers that are related to this exception and most of them specify something to do with either changing the domain, making a proxy, or changing security settings, but none of them have worked as of yet.  I wanted to make web sites that can be stored on a persons computer without having to be hosted and be able to access files for data storage, so hosting them in this case is not an option.  Preferably Id like to find a way to bypass the security settings. lili Similarly to the last issue, I wanted to find a way that once I make changes to a web page, I could store data about the page on the clients computer.  Serverside scripts give this option, but I havent been able to find anything for javascript to do it.  In either of these issues, jquery would be sufficient as well, if it would solve the problem. liol  pIn general I would like to try to find ways to make web pages operate as standalone applications on a persons computer, integrating everything from GUIs to graphics and all that fun stuff.  I would eventually like to integrate things like SMIL and SVG into web pages and something like XUL that will work on any browser, not just mozillabased ones.  That stuff can wait for later, this stuff will have to be taken care of first because its the most essential to the whole process.p

Negative 531 pstrongBackgroundstrongbr I am currently developing an Android application that makes use of a custom dialog to prompt for a password.  Thinking ahead, I would like to be able to use this dialog in its entirety in my future projects with a minimum of configuration.p  pstrongQuestionstrongbr Is there any way I can encapsulate all of the code and XML for this dialog into one package  Ideally, I would like to simply import the dialog and be done with it.  This is easy enough to do with the code, but I am not sure how to do this with the XML layout and string resources files.  Basically, I just dont want to have to manually add the string elements to my strings.xml file for each project as well as not have to copy and thus duplicate my layout.  I gave thought to hardcoding strings  layout into the code, but that seems like bad practice even for only 45 strings and 2 textboxes.p  pSo, what would be the best way to do thisp

The desired behavior is that if any of the child controls of the window have the focus, then that window is said to be active.p  pNow the IsFocused property doesnt seem to cascade, meaning if a child control has the focus, its container is not also set to focused so we cant use that.  For the same reason, we cant set the IsFocused property on the container as I believe that would steal it from the child.p  pMy only thought is to create a new DP called HasChildWithFocus or something like that, then in the codebehind, listen for the bubbled events and set that flag.

Is it is possible that the changing hash is triggering Firefox to keep trying to get the new manifest until it reaches some maximum 5 attemptsp  pThen, after the server is stopped, Firefox will not show the page at all.  It looks like it isnt caching the application.manifest.  Firefox also gives you a way to see what sites are storing stuff locally by going to ToolsOptionsAdvancedNetwork FirefoxPreferencesAdvancedNetwork on Apple.  I see localhost there but the size is 0 bytes.  So for some reason, Firefox is not downloading my application.manifest along with the filesp

Negative 531 pI have been going through the various questions here about nonce generation and PHP, but not found any discussions about the details of managing the once aspect of the nonce.p  pHere is my situation.p  pI have some PHP that needs to access a webservice, and requests to the webservice require my PHP to generate a nonce and sign the request ie, I am not requesting the nonce from the webservice.  That part is easy.p  pI am struggling with a good solution for preventing the reuse of a nonce when there can be multiple sessions going on.p  pAs I see it, there are three things I could do.p  pOne, is to store noncetimestamp pairs in the database, and then implement the logic to check the database for an existing nonce, expire old ones, etc.  This would also require a codeTRANSACTIONcode or codeLOCK TABLEcode for thread safety.  Yuck.p  pTwo, is to store the nonces in store the nonces in APC cant use memcached in my case, and let the TTL handle expiration.  In this case would threadsafety require wrapping the logic in codesemacquirecode  codesemreleasecode or is codeapcaddcode truly threadsafe  My main concern with this is how to handle the situation if codeapcaddcode or codeapcstorecode actually fail because the cache is full.p  pThree, is to use CacheLite instead of APC.p  pAre there any other options  As far as I can tell, OpenID manages nonces with CacheLite, so I suspect this is the best solution, but I want to check into all options before I commit.p  pThanks.p

Negative 531 pIm very new to the WPF and MVVM this is my 1st project in WPF. The project Im working on is supposed to accept some search criteria, and display the results in the grid. To construct the query Im using Dynamic LINQ queries. I seem to have issues managing instances of my ProjectSearchViewModel which corresponds to the view thats responsible for collecting the search criteria and executing the query. One instance is created when I create MainWindowViewModel. This creates all other viewmodel instances. This is what I expect. But when time comes to Show the MainWindow, I get another ProjectSearchViewModel, I guess from the binding. p  pThe general idea is thisp  ol lipThe search criteria are filled in the ProjectSearchView.pli lipWhen Load Command is pressed, I send SearchResultMessage using Reactive Extensions method.pli lipThe message is picked up by MainWindowViewModelpli lipMainWindowViewModel is querying the ProjectSearchViewModel.SearchResult and assigning the IObservable List to AllProjectsViewModel.AllProjects which is bound to a datagrid to show the results AllProjectView is responsible to show the grid with resulting projects listpli ol  pThe problem is that the parameter filling and sending of the SearchResultMessage happens in one instance of ProjectSearchViewModel and the actual querying of SearchResult from MainWindowViewModel happens in another instance, where all the search criteria are empty.p  pI guess I have no choice but to post my code Here it the abridged version of it, omitting some iDisposable plumbing and such. For my model I use Entity Framework 4.p  pAs I mentioned, Im a total newbie so If anyone sees any blatant disregard for common sense, please set me straight. p  pprecodep  pImports

Negative 531 pI am trying to set up multiple mini slideshows on the homepage of my site.  If you go there now a hrefhttpwww.element17.com relnofollowhttpwww.element17.coma, youll see theres six image categories, and currently some PHP grabs five random images from the database and puts them all in a slideshow div.  This seems to be the most popular setup for the jQuery slideshow plugins Ive seen.  I would like each of these six to slideshow through the five random images.p  pWhat I would like, though, is for the timeout on each slide to be random, so that the six slideshows dont sync up with each other.p  pI have seen that the Cycle plugin supports this but I have been unsuccessful in implementing it.  I dont need fancy transitions just fading and I dont need any other features, so it seems like maybe this would be easiest to do from scratch.

Negative 531 pIm working on a Javascriptheavy piece using jQuery for a website at the moment, Im working on getting a prototype going.p  pTo summarize what Im doing, I have a series of icons. Each icon, at the moment, is an image. I also have a series of buckets. The icons all start in a single bucket. The user is able to create new buckets and drag the icons around from bucket to bucket. The icons can also be turned on and off by clicking on them although they still remain in their bucket.p  pI have it all working fine at the moment, however at the moment its basically a bunch of img elements getting moved around from div to div. When Im ready to start implementing the serverside logic, Im going to need a way to communicate whats going on to the server.p  pWhat I need is a model object reflecting whats going on with the view. Itd be good if when the user is ready to send the data back to the server, Id have an object I could serialize representing what I need. For example, if the user has dragged the email.png icon into bucket the Options bucket, I would like for this to be reflected in a model object i.e.  options [email] .p  pThe issue is, all my logic is occurring based on events. When the user drags the icon to a div, an event is fired on the img DOM element, from which Im not sure how to access its model to update it. The only thing I can think of is parsing the img src and use that to find out the name of the model option but thats a very hackish and inelegant solution.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 531 pi have used jquery and javascript to create some custom rollover button functionality and i am experiencing an issue where a variable is not be overwritten but added to. The basic function of my code is on mouseover of a link, i simply want the link to slide up and double in height so that the bottom on portion of the graphic is showing exactly like css sliding doors rollovers.p  pHowever the issue i am having is that the doubleHeight variable is cumulative so that every time you roll over the link the double height of the link is not reset each time, it just adds it to the last value. Weirdly this is only happening after a lightbox is triggered on the page, before that the functionality works just fine. Here is my javascriptp  precodevar heightVal, doubleHeight  div.flexrolloverbtn p a.bindmouseover, function      heightVal  this.cssheight     doubleHeight  heightVal.replacepx,      doubleHeight  doubleHeight  2  px     this.cssheight doubleHeight, top   heightVal   div.flexrolloverbtn p a.bindmouseout, function      heightVal  this.parent.cssheight     this.cssheight heightVal, top 0  codepre  pand here is the HTML code it is acting uponp  precodeltdiv styleposition absolute top 322px left 13px width 139px height 79px zindex 3 classblock item3 flexrolloverbtngt     ltp stylewidth 75px height 53pxgtlta stylewidth 75px height 53px classnewwindow titleFlexible Size Rollover Test 2 hrefhttpdoctype.tvgtltimg height106 width75 altFlexible Size Rollover Test 2 srccmsarcadiacorpukrepositorypagesstaticstatic0000006614imagesflexrollover2.gifgtltagtltpgt ltdivgt codepre  pTo see it in action a hrefhttpwww.topshop.comwebappwcsstoresservletCatalogNavigationSearchResultCmdcatalogId33057ampstoreId12556amplangId1ampviewAllFlagfalseampcategoryId286989ampinterstitialtrue relnofollowgo herea scroll to the right and mouse over the red star thing, then open a lightbox any of the links with the  symbol next to them close it and mouseover the red star thing again and you will see what i mean.p

Negative 531 pI am hoping that codeCombinator parserscode, a hrefhttpdebasishg.blogspot.com200804externaldslsmadeeasywithscala.html relnofollowhttpdebasishg.blogspot.com200804externaldslsmadeeasywithscala.htmla, will work for a design to process the routing rules for a REST service that is implemented with codeScalatracode,a hrefhttptutorialbin.comtutorials80408infoqscalatraasinatralikewebframeworkforscala relnofollowhttptutorialbin.comtutorials80408infoqscalatraasinatralikewebframeworkforscalaa.p  pThis REST service is to serve as a proxy so external applications can get access to services within the firewall, as it will have additional layers of security that can be customized for the business requirements of each REST service.p  pSo, if a person wants to access their class schedule there will be less security than if you want to look at the transcript of someone.p  pI would like the rules for where to go to actually get the information, and how to return it, as well as what security is needed, in a DSL.p  pBut, the first problem is how to dynamically change the routing rules for the REST service based on a DSL, as I am trying to create a framework that doesnt require a great deal of recompiling to add new rules, but just write the appropriate scripts and just let it be processed.p  pSo, can a DSL be implemented using the Combinator Parser, in Scala, that will allow JAXRS a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavaee6tutorialdocgiepu.html relnofollowhttpdownload.oracle.comjavaee6tutorialdocgiepu.htmla to have dynamically changed routingp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI havent designed the language yet, but this is what I am trying to dop  precoderoute transcript using action GET to    httpinside.comtranscriptfirstparam2011secondparam  return json encrypt with public key from mntpublickey.txt  for educationcost using action GET combine httpcombine.comSOAPcosteducate with  httpcombine.comeducationbenefit2010 with  httpcombine.comeducationbenefit2011 return html codepre  pThese are two possible ideas where rules for a request for a transcript is sent to a different site, such as within a firewall, and the data is encrypted and returned.p  pThe second would be more complicated in that the results of a SOAP and two REST requests will be combined, and there would need to be additional commands on how this is combined, but the idea is to put all of this in files that can be parsed on the fly.p  pIf I used Groovy then some new classes could be generated for the routing, which would remove some performance hits, but I think using Scala would be the best bet, even if I took a performance hit.p  pMy hope is to make a framework that is more maintainable so new routing rules can be written by people that dont know any OOP or functional languages, but the specifications could be written using codeSpecscode a hrefhttpcode.google.compspecs relnofollowhttpcode.google.compspecsa so that the functional side could be certain that their requirements are tested on a regular basis.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pWhen I start working on a design I may intuitively understand some options, but not know why.  Today I realized that the reason that Groovy may be a better fix for this is that I could then generate the classes for routing, using the metaprogramming a hrefhttpwww.justinspradlin.comprogramminggroovymetaprogrammingaddingbehaviordynamically relnofollowhttpwww.justinspradlin.comprogramminggroovymetaprogrammingaddingbehaviordynamicallya, then I would be able to use Scala or Groovy to dynamically use the routing that was generated.  I am not certain how to get Scala to generate the classes if they dont already exist. p  pIn Groovy, as well as some other languages, as shown here a hrefhttplangexplr.blogspot.com200802handlingcalltomissingmethodin.html relnofollowhttplangexplr.blogspot.com200802handlingcalltomissingmethodin.htmla if a method is missing you can dynamically generate the method and it will henceforth exist, so it will be missing one time.p  pIt almost seems that I should be mixing Groovy with Java to make this work, but then the result may be that some of the code is in Scala and some in Java, for the routing of REST services.p

Negative 531 pI am using Sunspot to generate alot of my apps indexes and overviews.p  pIn this app i have 2 models which have a parentchild onetomany relationship. With Sunspot I index the number of childs a parent has, so this is available for sorting, scoping etc.p  pHowever, when I change the child model the parent model does not automatically get reindexed as it hasnt changed. Forcing a parent.save through a callback on the child doesnt force the index either.p  pSo before I start hacking away   p  pstrongWhat would be the best way to force an index action on the parent class in Sunspot when a child model gets changedaddedstrongp

Negative 531 pI really dont know what would be the best title for this. Basically, on my page I have a dropdown menu which is implemented by jQuery .slide. The dropdown appear in both at the top and bottom of the page, so its easier for user to scroll down and can still use the dropdown menu. The page to display this I use rail partial so that I can refactor it quite easy.p  pThe problem is, since the two dropdown menus are in the same page, so they cant not have the same ID but they have the same functionality, when the user click then opens up and show other options.

Negative 531 pstrongThe ideastrong Im creating a simple WebGL script using mrdoobs wonderful three.js that allows the user to control a camera in a world of objects. The camera is supposed to simulate traditional first person shooter cameras reference Team Fortress 2, for example. That is, the camera moves only when the mouse moves. p  pstrongThe issuestrong in Javascript, the only way to detect mouse movement is if the cursor itself moves. By comparison, FPS games dont show the cursor  they only base the movement of the camera off of how the mouse itself moves. So, you can move your mouse all over the mousepad in any direction and it always works. p  pOn a browser though, since camera movement is based on the cursor, you cant move but so far. When the cursor hits the edge of the screen, the user is unable to look any further in that direction e.g. you move your mouse to the left edge of the screen, you cant look left any more.p  pstrongThe solutionstrong Ive thought of two solutions, but neither of which I know how to implement. Either p  ol lipAfter the mouse is moved, the javascript resets it to the center of the screen. That way, after every mouse movement the player is free to again move in any direction. The issue with this is that, based on the research Ive done, Javascript is unable to control the position of the users mouse understandably, as it would be an incomparable nuisance on malignant sites.pli lipOr, the mouse wraps around the screen. Meaning, when the user reaches one edge of the screen, the mouse would simply continue on to the other side of the screen. see a hrefhttpwww.digicowsoftware.comdetailappWraparound relnofollowhttpwww.digicowsoftware.comdetailappWraparounda However, it appears that this too is not an inherent capability of javascript, but instead is only something a third party program could solve.pli ol  pSo, does the problem make sense If so, is there any way I can implement the above solutions, or is there another one Im missingp

Negative 531 pIm using CloudFlare CDN on my Rails 3.1 application. Cloudflare is a CDN that works at the DNS level. On the first hit to a static asset, CloudFlare loads it from your app then caches it in their CDN. Future requests for that asset load from the CDN instead of your app.p  pThe problem Im having is that if you set controller caching to truep  precodeconfig.actioncontroller.performcaching  true codepre  pit enables the RackCache middleware. Since Rails sets a default cache control setting for static assets, those assets get written to the Rails.cache store. As a result my cache store in my case redis is being filled up with static assets with the url as the hash key.p  pUnfortunately, I cant turn off the static asset cache control headers without affecting how Cloudflare and my users browsers cache the assets. I cant turn off controller caching or I lose pageactionfragment caching. Same result if I delete the RackCache middleware.p  pDoes anyone have any other ideasp  pUpdate Ive opened a ticket on GitHub a hrefhttpsgithub.comrailsrailsissues2468herea.p

Push it. Now I want to go get some coffee so I take my laptop with me down the street. How do I get the changes that I made on my desktop p  pI have tried this scenario already using  code git fetch gitgithub.comSpencerCooleysandbox.git crazyideacode , then codegit checkout crazyideacode, but when I look at the code, it looks exactly the same as it did before I did the fetch. When I look at the actual code on my github account I can see the changes I made so I know that my pushes are successful. I think I am misunderstanding what fetch does. I thought it was supposed to pretty much bring down all of the latest changes without merging. I would really appreciate anyones insight. p

Negative 531 pWe are currently in the process of moving a system to use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWindowsCommunicationFoundation relnofollowWCFa and ran into an issue that we cant figure out. The setup is there is a C DLL file that wraps a C and a Visual Basic 6.0 DLL file. The C DLL file has wrappers for both of these, and instantiates both objects. The C object is initialized grabs data from files and is then passed to a Visual Basic 6.0 object, that runs a report using the data in the C object. This is all happening as a WCF Service Application, and for the most part it works great, but when the Visual Basic 6.0 code calls a method in the C object, the whole thing hangs.p  pI tested out using just a simple application that calls the same C DLL file outside of WCF, and it works flawlessly. So, there is something going on with WCF and that C DLL file, but we cant figure out what.

Negative 531 pemOne of the most prevalent attacks today is crosssite scripting XSS, which is more of an attack on your applications users than on the application itself, but it exploits serverside application vulnerabilities all the same.

Negative 531 pI want to print a Bitmap to a mobile Bluetooth Printer Bixolon SPPR200  the SDK doesnt offer direkt methods to print an inmemory image. So I thought about converting a Bitmap like thisp  precodeBitmap bitmap  Bitmap.createBitmapwidth, height, Bitmap.Config.ARGB8888 codepre  pTo a Monochrome Bitmap. I am drawing black text on above given Bitmap using a Canvas, which works well. However, when I convert the above Bitmap to a ByteArray, the printer seems to be unable to handle those bytes. I suspect I need an Array with one Bit per Pixel a Pixel would be either white  1 or black  0.p  pAs there seems to be no convenient, out of the box way to do that, one idea I had was to use p  precodebitmap.getPixelspixels, offset, stride, x, y, width, height codepre  pto Obtain the pixels. I assume, Id have to use it as followsp  precodeint width  bitmap.getWidth int height  bitmap.getHeight  int [] pixels  new int [width  height] bitmap.getPixelspixels, 0, width, 0, 0, width, height codepre  pHowever  I am not sure about a few thingsp  ul liIn getPixels  does it make sense to simply pass the width as the Stride argumentli liI guess Id have to evaluate the color information of each pixel and either switch it to black or white And Id write this value in a new target byte array which I would ultimately pass to the printerli liHow to best evaluate each pixel color information in order to decide that it should be black or white The rendered Bitmap is black pain on a white backgroundli ul  pDoes this approach make sense at all Is there an easier way Its not enough to just make the bitmap black amp white, the main issue is to reduce the color information for each pixel into one bit.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAs suggested by Reuben Ill first convert the Bitmap to a monochrome Bitmap. and then Ill iterate over each pixelp  precode    int width  bitmap.getWidth     int height  bitmap.getHeight      int[] pixels  new int[width  height]     bitmap.getPixelspixels, 0, width, 0, 0, width, height       Iterate over height     for int y  0 y lt height y          int offset  y  height          Iterate over width         for int x  0 x lt width x              int pixel  bitmap.getPixelx, y               codepre  pNow Reuben suggested to read the lowest byte of each 32bit pixel  that would relate to my question about how to evaluate the pixel color. My last question in this regard Do I get the lowest byte by simply doing thisp  precode Using the pixel from bitmap.getPixelx,y int lowestByte  pixel amp 0xff codepre

Negative 531 pWhen I write a Java program I always try to organize my code following the MVC pattern, in order to get a smooth and efficient program.  Ive created an Android application and I was wondering if the MVC can be used.  I have thought that the Android code is a Javaderived code, so Ive tried, but I have some problems to reconcile the Android activities Views for the pattern with the Controller. The controller should catch user interactions with the app button clicked, write label... and refresh the View with new information obtained by the Model. So, what can I do and eventually the MVC can be used in Android applicationsp

Negative 531 pI was working on an audit trail module that require me to create a huge list of shadow table from original table. I was thinking to write a stored procedure that could generate a shadow table from another table. This table could be any table, it could be tableA that consist of 3 fields of any data type, or tableB that consist of 10 fields of any data type, and that could base on the parameter pass into the store procedure.p  pI know I can retrieve a list of fields available to the particular tableA from syscolumns and systables like thisp  precodeselect  from syscolumns where tabid  select tabid from systables where tabnametableA codepre  pThere will be a list of fields return from this statement, lets say fieldA, then I will rename this fieldA to create 2 new fields which is prefieldA and postfieldA, and then use these 2 new fields to create a shadow table of shadowtableA. Apply this concept to the rest of the fields. Need not worry about the data type of a field because this information already there in syscolumns, and I can just dup it over to shadow table.p  pI am currently stuck at how could I store the list of values return from the statement above, because usually any table will consist of more than one field. Can it be done using array or any alternate solution to create shadow table for audit trail purposep
Negative 531 pI have one question about optimistic locking in Hibernate. I am trying to go deep inside optimistic locking with Hibernate, but I have one doubt. Hibernate uses version approach integer or timestamp to implement optimistic locking. To configure you can use Version annotation or xml configuration and create a version attribute. The other option is configuring without versioning using optimisticlockall attribute. p  pMy question is in case that you don not define any versioning attribute and also you do not specify an optimisticlock attribute, which strategy uses Hibernate in this cases Pessimistc Locking I am pretty sure that no, so I suppose that is optimistic locking but dont know how.p  pThank you very much for your attention.p

Negative 531 pI have a window with a small text box, bound to a Core Data attribute. The value the user enters into the text box needs to be within certain parameters. These parameters are dynamic. If the entered value is outside of the parameters, a dialog box is displayed asking if the user wants to revert to a previous value, set the value to a minimum, etc. I have implemented the controlTextDidEndEditing method to intercept and validate the value the user enters. My problem is when the user saves or quits. The user can enter a bad value, select save or quit and value is saved, bypassing the validation. Is there a way to have my validation method called before a save Thanksp

Supply nodes are specified in a vector, in which for each timestep the available supply is given.p  pTo meet the demand, supply nodes are analysed subsequently whether they can meet the demand, and the fluxes from the supply nodes to the demand node are updated accordingly.

Ive tried calling emActor.exitem, which just throws an emInterruptedExceptionem, and Im just about to give up completely on emActor.selfem.  Am I missing somethingp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pJust discoveredp  precodescala.actorsScheduler.shutdown codepre  pwhich works for global termination, and will get the job done for now.  I would prefer to change the default scheduler to be a emDaemonSchedulerem, so please post an answer if you know how.p

Negative 531 pIm playing around with MongoDB for the moment to see what nice features it has.  Ive created a small test suite representing a simple blog system with posts, authors and comments, very basic.p  pIve experimented with a search function which uses the MongoRegEx class PHP Driver, where Im just searching through all post content and post titles after the sentence lorem ipsum with case sensitive on I.p  pMy code looks like this  p  precoderegex  new MongoRegExlorem ipsumi   query  arraypost gt regex, posttitle gt regex codepre  pBut Im confused and stunned about what happens.  I check every query for running time set microtime before and after the query and get the time with 15 decimals.p  pFor my first test Ive added 110.000 blog documents and 5000 authors, everything randomly generated. When I do my search, it finds 6824 posts with the sentence lorem ipsum and it takes 0.000057935714722 seconds to do the search. And this is strongafterstrong Ive reset the MongoDB service using Windows and this is without any index other than the default on id.p  pMongoDB uses a Btree index, which most definitely isnt very efficient for a full text search.  If I create an index on my post content attribute, the same query as above runs in 0.000150918960571, which funny enough is slower than without any index slower with a factor of 0.000092983245849.  Now this can happen for several reasons because it uses a Btree cursor.p  pBut Ive tried to search for an explanation as to how it can query it so fast. I guess that it probably keeps everything in my RAM Ive got 4GB and the database is about 500MB. This is why I try to restart the mongodb service to get a full result.p  pCan anyone with experience with MongoDB help me understand what is going on with this kind of full text search with or without index and definitely without an inverted indexp  pSincerely   Mestikap

Obviously thats because the image is hidden behind some type of script. Through trial and error I found that I can put .jpg after the CISOPTR491 and then the link becomes an Image URL. The problem is that this is not the highresolution version of the image. To get to the highresolution version I have to change the URL even more. I found a lot of articles Stackoverflow.com to mention trying to build a script using curl and PHP, I have even tried a few of them with no luck. 491 is the image number and I can change that number to find other images in the same directory. So, scraping a sequence of numbers should be pretty easy. But Im still a noob at scraping and this one is kicking my butt.

Negative 531 pIm working on a Python script that needs to create about 50 distinct temporary files, which are all appended frequently during the course of the script and merged at the end. Im sure that the codetempfilecode module can do what I need, but I havent been able to figure out how from reading the documentation.p  pI want to use temporary filesas opposed to variablesto conserve system memory, as these data chunks grow large as the script processes tens of thousands of other files.p  pThe following chunk of code is the hack Im currently using to create these files untemporarily in an untemporary directoryp  precodeitem  string from another file    string must id file for future use tmpfile  tmpfiles  item if item not in totalitems    totalitems.additem    with opentmpfile, w as itemfile       output  some stuff       tmpfile.writeoutput else    with opentmpfile, a as itemfile       output  different stuff       tmpfile.writeoutput codepre  pI think what I need is codetempfile.NamedTemporaryFilecode.

Negative 531 pIve seen some similar questions out of which I have made a system which works for me but I need to optimize it because this program alone is taking up a lot of CPU load.p  pHere is the problem exactly. p  pI have an incoming signalstream of data which I need to plot in real time. I only want a limited number of points to be displayed at a time Say 1024 points so I plot the data points along the y axis against an index from 01024 on the xaxis. The values of the incoming data range from 01023. p  pWhat I do currently This is all in C is I put the data into a circular loop as it comes and each time the data gets updated Or every secondthird data point, I write out to a file and using a pipe, I plot the data from that file with gnuplot. p  pWhile this works almost perfectly, it causes a fair bit of load Depending on the input data rate, I saw even 70 usage on both my cores of my Core 2 Duo. Ill need to be running some processor intensive code along with this short program so I feel that it is almost necessary to optimize it. p  pWhat I was hoping could be done is this Can I only plot the differences between the current plot and the new data Or plot each point as it comes in without replotting the whole graph such that the old item at that x index is removed. p  pI have a fixed number of points on the graph so replot wouldnt work. I want the old point at that x location to be removed.p

Negative 531 pIm having a somewhat edge case problem in a large MVC2 application.  Initially, I had a single main view, which would load partial views while loading, which would contain links.  I have a local working environment, which uses an empty virtual path setting in the project settings page, and a staging environment, which to better reflect the multiapplication production environment has an applicationspecific virtual path.  Everythign worked fine on both.  Recently, I have had reason to switch the partial view loading from on pageload to an asynch.  No other change was made.  The links continued to function locally, but when moved up to staging, neglected to add on the applicationspecific path setting, leading to all of them breaking.  I was able to find a workaround, based on using a significantly more thorough address, but I feel like there must be some sort of config setting somewhere that Im missing that would fix this.p  pTo be clearer as I realize that the preceding may be a bit unclear, this particular error occurs only if the following are all truep  ul liThe partial view containing the links must be put in place by an asych get call and jquery code.htmlcode function.  When it is loaded by MVC directly into the page, everything works fine.li liMust be on a server with virtual path set to something other than empty.  The problem here is somehow coming from not appending the string from the virtual path setting.  Indeed, if you manually enter the virtual path in the appropriate place to the links produced, they work fine.li liat least with respect to the partial view call, it must be in the form codePartialViewpartialViewName, dataObjectcode rather than codePartialViewAreasappNameViewscontrollerNamepartialViewName.ascx, dataObjectcode.  Swapping in the longer format does work.li ul  pAdmittedly, I could just figure out by trial and error some way to swap the longer name in for the inner links as well and have everything more or less work, but its not a terribly clean solution, Im likely to need to do the same thing again in the future elsewhere, and I feel like there must be a better answer out there.

Negative 531 pIve moved from Xcode 4.3 to the new 4.4 version that was just released and now get a few dozen linker warnings of this nature when building a frameworkp  precodeDirect access in ltsome methodgt to global weak symbol ltsome other methodgt means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings. codepre  pThere are a few other questions on SO about this warning which seem to be solved by making sure codefvisibilityhidden fvisibilityinlineshiddencode is on everywhere and then doing full rebuilds, but this hasnt solved the warnings in my case. I have triplechecked and codefvisibilityhidden fvisibilityinlineshiddencode is present for all the compiles done by Xcode, including C files, Objective C files and the precompiled header. I have done full rebuilds including wiping out Xcodes DerivedData for my project. Nothing seems to help.p  pThese warnings didnt occur under Xcode 4.3, but I dont have another Mac handy with 4.3 on to go back and sanity check with. Im still running Lion.p  pThe other weird thing is that the project has an external SCons build system that builds all the same code with codefvisibilityhidden fvisibilityinlineshiddencode using the Xcode 4.4 command line tools and it doesnt report any of these linker warnings same compiler version in both cases.p  pIm going to keep digging, but any expert insight would be appreciated. Maybe its an Xcode 4.4 change Im unaware ofp  pThanks.p

Do I have to Or can I just use it emsilentlyemp  pSo, a website with Rails MIT, some GPL ruby gems, and so on, what should I include publicly I think Im not going to modify the source code of any of those gems.. Yeah, and if I have to attribute in my web pages, do I have to link to the licenses or even worse distribute my source code under the same licensep  pAlso, if I found a tutorial or something like that that is licensed under Creative Commons BYNC, should I distribute my whole work or put it under the same license, if I wasnt going to run them outside my own server What if I wanted to distribute my software, which used ideas and modified code from the tutorialp  pWhat about using formulas, which are more general than being owned Oneliner commands from stackoverflow when a gem doesnt install  Should I attribute that I used that to install the gem I think of course not, but just asking to make sure of the whole thing..p

Negative 531 pIm new to IOS and ObjectiveC so please excuse any missuse of terminology... In my app I have chosen to use the settings.bundle to store my app settings but when the app is first installed and before the user navigates to Settings on their IOS device it does not load the defaults. I have read many posts explaining that the app should create its own defaults until the settings.bundle has been initialised.p  pTo do this I have written some code that reads in the settings.bundle and creates an array accordingly. But if settings.bundle has not been initialised it creates a default array to be used in the interim. I suspect that my problem is with the following line of code where I am using a logical AND operator probably incorrectly...p  precodeif [swimtypeendurance isEqualToStringON] ampamp [swimtypeendurance isEqualToStringOFF] codepre  pThe problem is that I cannot get a true result for the if statement above, my app always executes the else. My understanding of settings.bundle is that if they have not been initialised then the switch is neither ON or OFF as if it has no value. I am therefore testing to see if the string for swimtypeendurance is neither ON or OFF, in other words if it is not ON AND it is not OFF  hence my attempted use of the  and ampamp...p  pPerhaps a better way to exaplain what I am doing is I am testing the value of one of my settings from settings.bundle to see if it is either on or off.

Everything works fine but when Im trying to execute code like p  precodepublic enum SomeEnum  int      value1  0,     value2  1   class Program      static void Mainstring[] args              TestDbEntities context  new TestDbEntities         var enumList  new ListltSomeEnumgt  SomeEnum.value1, SomeEnum.value2          var items  context.Table1.Wheree gt enumList.Containse.EnumField         foreach var item in items                      Console.Writeitem.Id                  context.Dispose       codepre  pIm getting ArgumentException with messagep  precodeThe type SomeEnum does not match the EDM enumeration type SomeEnum or its underlying type Int32 Parameter name value.     codepre  pWhat is wired is that when Im not using reference external type everything is okay.

Negative 531 pIn an embedded application I am working on, I frequently need to packetize data from several different objects to be sent out over a serial port. Similarly, data comes in on the serial port that needs to be written to several different objects.p  pFor compatibility reasons, the ordering of the data in the packets does not allow for all the data associated with one object to be placed consecutively in the packet. So I can not easily vectorize, etc. data from each object and then put all that in a packet.p  pI can achieve proper functionality using a very large number of gettersmutators that the packet class uses to createdecode transmittedreceived packets. But this does not seem very elegant.p  pI could make the packet class a friend of the classes it pullswrites data fromto, but I was always told to avoid using friends as that sort of violates objectoriented principles.p  pIdeally the classes that handle the actual application would not know anything about the packet class and not have to provide gettersmutators exclusively for it and they simply would have new data if a packet came in between updates.p  pI thought that maybe I could pass references or pointers to the relevant member variables to the packet class at startup, but that is also tricky because all the members are not the same size. Perhaps I could also pass the size information as well Would there be a way to vectorize a list of void pointer to member and size of member pairs so that the packet class does not need to take a gigantic amount of arguments to its constructorp  pI am not sure how well I have described this problem, but I can certainly provide clarifications and more information if that would help. Thanks very much for any ideas.p  pAbbreviated example of tx packet class currentlyp  precodeclass PacketTx  private   uint8t buffer[MAXPACKETSIZE]    MAXPACKETSIZE is 200 public   PacketTxobject1 firstObject,            object2 secondObject,            object3 thirdObject             ...etc...                void sendPacketvoid   void PacketTxsendPacketvoid    uint32t i  0    int16t tempVar1  firstObjectgtgetVar1   uint32t tempVar2  secondObjectgtgetVar2   uint8t tempVar3  firstObjectgtgetVar3   int32t tempVar4  thirdObjectgtgetVar4    ...etc...    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar1, sizeoftempVar1   i  sizeoftempVar1    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar2, sizeoftempVar2   i  sizeoftempVar2    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar3, sizeoftempVar3   i  sizeoftempVar3    memcpybuffer  i, amptempVar4, sizeoftempVar4   i  sizeoftempVar4     ...etc...    foruint32t j  0 j lt i j     putcstaticcastltchargtbuffer[i]  codepre  pThis example doesnt include header, checksum, etc., but it should give a basic idea of what is causing me a headache.p

Negative 531 pSo say I have an algorithm like thisp  precodevoid dummyalgorithmint a[]     int center  floora.length2    For reference purposes Loop 1      forint i  0 i lt center i         The best code youve ever seen        Loop 2    forint j  center  1 j lt a.length j        Slightly less awesome code      codepre  pIts pretty basic stuff.

However, the total work the method does is obviously On.p  pSo, my question is How do I prove via a recurrence relation that this algorithm is On Or am I wrong on this altogetherp  pNote I cannot combine the two loops into one. They preform actions that eventually go into recursive calls. Anything else you can think of isnt allowed. There are a lot of constraints on this problem.p

Negative 531 pI have a question related to how Android service behaves when stopped by system. As per my understanding, if system OS stops the service due to resources needed, it is responsibility of system to start it again. In this scenario, system would not call onDestroy when stopping service and onCreate when starting service, rather it would just call onStartCommand.p  pIf I am creating a thread in onStartCommand, how would I cleanup thread when system stops service. If I dont stop thread, onStartCommand would create a new thread. I think, it may come down to onStartCommand parameters intent, flags and startId. They might be different when system starts service after stopping it because it needed resources. Could anyone tell me what would be difference in parameters when service started by startService command or by system itself after stopping itp  pI can create thread in onCreate but I am not sure if thread still exists when system stops service. What would be the best way to handle this kind of scenario.p  pThanksp
Negative 531 h1Introductionh1  pI am trying to make a rather complex structure in Java with interfaces, abstract classes and generics. Having no experience with generics and only average experience with creating good OOP designs, this is beginning to prove quite a challenge.p  pI have some feeling that what Im trying to do cannot actually be done, but that I could come close enough to it. Ill try to explain it as brief as I can. Im just going to tell straight away that this structure will represent my DAO and service layers to access the database. Making this question more abstract would only make it more difficult.p  pMy DAO layer is completely fine as it is. There is a generic DAO interface and for each entity, there is a DAO interface that extends the generic one and fills in the generic types. Then theres an abstract class that is extended by each DAO implementation, which in turn implement the corresponding interface. Confusing read for most probably, so heres the diagram showing the DAO for Products as an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3ncmi.png altDiagram showing the DAO implementation for Product entitiesp  pNow for the service classes, I had a similar construction in mind. Most of the methods in a service class map to the DAO methods anyway. strongIf you replace every DAO in the diagram above with Service, you get the basis for my service layer.strong But there is one thing that I want to do, based on the following idea I havep  blockquote   pEvery service class for an entity will at least access one DAO object, namely the DAO of the entity that it is designed for.p blockquote  pWhich is...p  h1The questionproblemh1  pIf I could make a proper OO design to strongmake each service class have one instance variable for the DAO object of their respective entitystrong my service layer would be perfect, in my view. strongAdvice on this is welcome, in case my design is not so good as it seemed.strongp  pI have implemented it like thisp  h2Class AbstractServiceh2  precodepublic abstract class AbstractServiceltEntityDAOgt       EntityDAO entityDAO      public AbstractService          entityDAO  makeEntityDAO compilerIDE warning overridable method call in constructor           abstract EntityDAO makeEntityDAO  codepre  h2Class ProductServiceImplh2  precodepublic class ProductServiceImpl extends AbstractServiceltProductDAOImplgt       public ProductServiceImpl          super           Override     ProductDAOImpl makeEntityDAO          return new ProductDAOImpl       codepre  pstrongThe problem with this design is a compiler warning I dont like it has an overridable method call in the constructorstrong see the comment. Now it is strongdesignedstrong to be overridable, in fact I enforce it to strongmake sure that each service class has a reference to the corresponding DAO.strong Is this the best thing I can dop  pI have done my absolute best to include everything you might need and only what you need for this question.

Negative 531 h2What I am trying to doh2  pI am somewhat desperately trying to build an algorithm which strongconverts financial figures from different companies from fiscal periods to calendar periodsstrong. p  h2The problemh2  pstrongFiscalstrong periods often do not correspond to strongcalendarstrong periods, e.g. a company might report fiscal year 2011 revenues of 100 USD but its fiscal year does not end at the end of December 2011 but instead on September 2011. For instance, a hrefhttpinvestor.apple.comfaq.cfmFaqSetID3 relnofollowAppleas fiscal year ends end of September. a hrefhttpcontent.dell.comusencorpdfinancialsinvestorfaqs relnofollowDellsa fiscal year ends end of January and a hrefhttpwww.intel.comintelcompanycorp4.htm relnofollowIntelas fiscal year ends end of December. For Apple and Dell, all fiscal quarter and fiscal half year ends are shifted as well.p  pIn order to compare revenues or other financial metrics among these companies, I need to be able to convert each fiscal period into equivalent calendar periods. For instance, someone might ask, how much revenue each company generated in calendar year 2011.p  pIn the case of Apple Corp., we would need to remove the revenues which have been generated in calendar period 2010, which would equal Apples fourth quarter of FY2010 and add the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 which ended December 2011.p  h2What I have data modelh2  pMy data model has the following attributes for each entity codecalendarPeriodcode and codefiscalPeriodcodep  pcodeendYearcode year in which the period endsbr codeendMonthcode month number    1..12 at which last day the period endsbr codelengthcode number of months 1..12 of the periodp  h2What I need desperatelyh2  pWhat would be the most efficient and short algorithm I could accomplish thisp  pIt would be great if the algorithm could handle special situations like Dell where it would need to take 13 of its fiscal first quarter, which ends emawfullyem on January, of the following year and adding it to the last quarter of the preceding year. In addition the algorithm should be flexible enough to handle all period lengths and endMonths and try to combine periods if necessary for instance for the first half of calendar year 2012, it should try to find a six month period which ends June 2012 or consecutively add two periods one ending March 2012 and one ending June 2012 or taking a fiscal year which ends June 2012 and subtracting the quarters or half year which fall in calendar year 2011.p  pThank you so much.p

Negative 531 pWhy Visual Studio does not refresh some properties in its Property Window when they are modified in an other propertys setterp  pHere is an examplep  precodepublic partial class MyControl UserControl    public MyControl  InitializeComponent    private bool myThingfalse   [CategoryBehavior]   public bool Mything      get  return myThing      set        myThingvalue       EnabledEnabled       VisibleVisible       AllowDropAllowDrop       AutoScrollAutoScroll       AutoSizeAutoSize       TabIndex2          codepre  pMake this class to Class Library, build it to a DLL, then put this component to Visual Studios Toolbox. Then make a new Windows Forms Application in VS, and put this componentMyControl from the toolbox to Form1.p  pNow go and change the Mything property in the VSpropertyeditor with clicks. As it turns on and off, you can see in the property editor it increases the TabIndex, and turns on and off the AutoSize and codeAutoScrollcode properties correctly, BUT NOT the Enabled, Visible, and AllowDrop properties These three does not change in the property editor WHYp  pYou can try this out with a Button instead of a UserControl also, and you can see the Button changes to gray when Enabled property is turned off by Mythingsetter, BUT ONLY in the designer view, in the property editor window it still shows the original value Furthermore if you save the application, you can see in the Form1.Designer.cs that the Enabled property is not refreshed And next time loading the project it loads the unmodified value which was shown in the property editor windowp  pIve tried using codeRefreshPropertiescode Attribute, Ive tried implementing codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode, but no luck p  pSo, why Visual Studio does refresh some properties in its propertyeditor and DOES NOT refresh some other And in the setter code how can i FORCE Visual Studio property window to REFRESHp  pAny ideasp

Negative 531 pIm a bit new to CSShtml.  I am trying to include this jquery plugin using tablesorter that basically lets your columns sort.  It looks to change the class type when the header of the table is clicked on to sort the column in ascendingdescending order.  Im trying to follow this tutorial a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.nethajanarchive20110209tablesortingamppaginationwithjqueryinaspnetmvc.aspx relnofollowhttpweblogs.asp.nethajanarchive20110209tablesortingamppaginationwithjqueryinaspnetmvc.aspxap  pSo in one of my columns, it doesnt make sense to be able to sort since its all the same.  Im starting with a asp.netmvc3 application and Im referring to the last column where you can click on Details.  Since this doesnt change Id like to not have the updown arrows in that column.  The original css looks likep  precodetable.tablesorter      fontfamilyarial     backgroundcolor CDCDCD     margin10px 0pt 15px     fontsize 11pt     width 100     textalign left  table.tablesorter thead tr th, table.tablesorter tfoot tr th      backgroundcolor e6EEEE     border 1px solid FFF     fontsize 10pt     padding 4px  table.tablesorter thead tr .header      backgroundimage urlthemesbaseimagesbg.gif     backgroundrepeat norepeat     backgroundposition center right     cursor pointer  table.tablesorter tbody td      color 3D3D3D     padding 4px     backgroundcolor FFF     verticalalign top  table.tablesorter tbody tr.odd td      backgroundcolorF0F0F6  table.tablesorter thead tr .headerSortUp      backgroundimage urlthemesbaseimagesasc.gif  table.tablesorter thead tr .headerSortDown      backgroundimage urlthemesbaseimagesdesc.gif  table.tablesorter thead tr .headerSortDown, table.tablesorter thead tr .headerSortUp      backgroundcolor 8dbdd8  codepre  pSo I thought I could addp  precodetable.tablesorter thead .nostyle      margin 0     padding 0     border 0     outline 0     fontsize 100     verticalalign baseline     backgroundcolor 8dbdd8  codepre  pAnd then in the header I dont want style, dop  precode            ltth classnostylegtltthgt codepre  pBut that doesnt work.

Negative 531 pIve been exploring 2D Plot defaults, Patch and other documentation, as well as Matlab forums for a solution to this problem and have none after 3 months of looking.p  pI am using line segment data to draw U.S. Census districts of Vermont, thereby creating a map of the state. The 185 patches that constitute Vermont create a graph that is slightly tilted to the left, as if the 2D drawing is being projected onto a 3D plane. I have the same issue with Delaware data.p  pWhy does Patchx,y insist on patching in a tilted manner, even when I go through the Figure window and all signs say it is displaying in 2Dp  pEdit 1 Using code[az,el]  viewcode I get codeel  90code, meaning my plot is definitely 2D, as described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8064969howtodetermineifaxesare2dor3dinmatlabHow to determine if axes are 2D or 3D in Matlabap

Negative 531 pFirst I want to thank you for all your help on the page, its been really helpful. Now Ive come across a situation that I cant figure out, and I hope you can help me, this is itp  pAt my workplace I have access to an Oracle DB with a table filled with users on it names, lastname, birthdate and other stuff. It has 17 millions of records, and for each record I need to generate a unique key lets say its the 2 first letters of the name plus the birthdate concatenated, actually is more complex but its an example, so for this key I need to retrieve the record, calculate the key and then update the record with the key. Now over 17 million records its killing the serverp  pSo the DB at work is Oracle, I copied the data to my machine into a MYSQL database for testing. I was planning on testing locally making the calculations with php, and then create a java application to create the key on the server, but its a massive workload I dont know which way to go. The simple select takes 10 minutes on php on mysql via command line takes 1.49 minutes to COUNT the recordsp  pI know that its better to calculate the key as the records come in. They arrive in packages of 500k but since I just got here, the data is already merged and I have to work on these records.p  pSo what would you recommend this poor soul to do about such a task. I was thinking triggers or plsql but Im really lost on what would be better in terms of performance.p  pThank you very muchp  pas a request from ogres and in hope you can help me, heres the code in php for the calculation I need to do for every rowp  precodevn0holds the value calculated for name sqlselect  from rootstable holding triplets for characternumber ex 1A13, field names consecutivecharactercode resultadosmysqlquerysql,idcon whiledatomysqlfetcharrayresultadosi put all of the pairs in an associative array for quicker acces      consulta[dato[vpropio]]arraydato[caracter],dato[vprimo]  coding the name, for every char in the name i add to vn, the consecutive times the position of the character in the string, plus the code for the character, if null, i add some values pos1 for i0iltstrlennombrei      charsubstrnombre,i,1     charcharnumchar     ifcharNULL          vnvncharposconsulta[char][1]          else     vnvn  28  107     pos  end of name coding  i format the code for the name to 4 digits if  vn lt 1000 and vn gt 99      vn  0.vn  else if  vn lt 100 and vn gt 9       vn  00.vn  else if  vn lt 10       vn  000.vn   else     vnvn  codepre  pFINALLY I CONCATENATE THE FIRST TWO CHARS IN NAME WITH THE CODE CALCULATED AND THE BIRTHDAY EX JH235408071984 WOULD COME FROM FOR JHON BORN ON 19840807 WITH NAME CODE CALCULATED 2354p  precodeCODEtrimsubstrnombre,0,2.trimvn.formatFechafnac codepre  pHOPE IT HELPS AND YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME POINTERSp

In my case, it is not that the user is explicitly changing the order. Rather, they are modifying their bank of things, and they may change the thing in slot 1 to be the thing in slot 3, and vice versa. So if the user performs this operation, the table should look like thisp  precodethingid  userid  order     3         1       0     2         1       1     1         1       2 codepre  pWhat complicates this is that thingid, userid has a unique constraint, so doing sequential updates does not quite work. If I try to codeUPDATE tbl SET thingid3 WHERE thingid1code, the unique constraint is broken. p  pThe order column is purely for show, in order to make an alphabetized list. So I suppose I could use PHP to check the order and figure things out like that, but this introduces code that really has nothing to do with the important stuff. Id like to find a solution that is purelymostly SQL.p  pAlso, along the same lines, if I were to insert a new row into the table, I would want the order value to be 3. Is there an efficient way to do this in SQL, without first having to codeSELECT MAXorder WHERE userid1codep

Thus, the summary value is also a decimal value.  Id like to access the summary value and convert it to hours  minutes.  Ive labeled the express as WorkTimeSum, but cant seem to get a handle to it, however.  Fields obviously wont work since it is a summary expression.  I was thinking ReportItems should work, but to no avail.  How can I use this expression field in a summary row in an expression in the same summary rowp

Negative 531 pIve seen a few discussions regarding Point Sprites vs Textured Quad Sprites and the like.p  pHowever, one thing confuses me, if I understand correctly, arent the size of point sprites limited By a point sprite rangep  pIm fairly new to OpenGL ES 2.0 so am very likely missing something, but under what circumstances could point sprites be used effectively in a game apart from the obvious being a particle system  If they cant go over a certain size, then arent they pretty much useless for characters etc I understand also that the min and max sizes may vary from device to device making things even more unpredictablep  pEDIT Further to the comments below and further research it appears that the only size that is guaranteed for a Point is 1 being 1 pixel.p  pSo on a system like Android with so many screen DPIs and resolutions, are points even realistically usable for particle systemsp  pLet me elaborate, on a low Res  DPI screen a single pixel point will appear quite large , but on say, a Nexus 10 tablet with its really high Res  DPI screen a single pixel point is going to virtually unnoticeable.  Normally when I work with sprites I scale them according to the screen resolution ie, if I want a sprite to take up 14 of the available screen I will simply scale it by screen2 in both X and Y directions.  This gives me screen independence and works great.  But if I need a particle size of say 4 on my N10 Tablet so it takes up the same amount of relative space than of say a lowerend and lower res phone device which only uses a point size of 1 and I cant be guarantee anything bigger than 1 pixel  how is this going to workp  pIm just trying to understand when PointsPoint Sprites would be useful in a system like Androidp

Negative 531 pI have a an application that acts in a certain way, when it is executed it uses the current class path set for java executable but unfortunately it doesnt make it the application work like it should, But when I alter this path by adding just an extra character the application works perfectly fine, p  pSo I believe the application bypasses using the path which is why it works fine with an altered java class path. But the problem is some one else is using this path for their own application in other words i can only temporarily alter this path and will always have to put it back to the normal path. p  pBut What I am thinking is that there should be a way for me to be able to create a file that has the Java Path inside which I could put in the folder when this application executes with this instead of the application looking at the first class path it only looks at the one in the folder. p  pAny idea on how this can be done   Many thanks in advance.p

Negative 531 pI am using the Intellij 11.1.5. We are a large team, and have a pretty complex project setup. so weve made a template and when someone needs a new project set up, we just clone it and she is pretty much ready to go. One other thing i would like to automate is the creation of run configurations. One such configuration starts a custom bat file that requires a parameter representing a path that is user specific. I wanted to know if can store that value as a path variable specific to each project. Maybe somewhere in the .idea folder in my project. I know that Intellij stores it in its .IntelliJIdea11configoptionspath.macros.xml file, but is there a way to tweak thatp  pAny other idea that would allow me to locally store a parameter passed to the run config script would be usefull.p  pThanksp
Negative 531 pOn mobile, most of my clients website looks like the regular desktop page. It hasnt been made responsive, but its being worked on. Since the body width is fixed at 1000px, its all tiny text and stuff in your mobile browser. So that will be a double tap party to actually read the content.p  pSo what is my question Im building a little notification bar for mobile. Its a little yellow bar that slides in from the bottom of a webpage, telling the user that the page theyre viewing isnt optimized for mobile yet. Apart from the fact whether youd actually want this, Im trying to figure out how to make the fonts inside of the bar to have a consistent physical size on all devices. Problem is that all devices these days have a wide range of DPI. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions521832consistentfontsizeacrossbrowserswebdevelopmentAnother questiona I found on StackOverflow deals with this, but only treats the desktop case. Mobile is a whole different ballgame. p  pIve been meddling with mm in CSS, but the inconsistency in textrendering between browsers is beyond massive. I guess I could do it by calculating fontsize in px based on pixel density. Or by writing a bunch of media queries for all DPI variations. But that all seems stupid. Am I overlooking something here Is there an easier way to do thisp

Negative 531 pThis feels like a really simple question, however, in every instance that Ive looked for and found an answer it was far beyond my level of comprehension. Im relatively new to Java, only having started back in September for my A.P. Comp Sci class. However, I am making a very simple applet to ask a similarly nerdy girl to prom. So basically this means that I need the applet to work just by being on the flash drive which I will give to her. Ive never needed to export before and my program runs fine at least from Eclipses standpoint, however, every time I export it as a .jar file and try to run it, nothing happens. At all. No error, no box, nothing. I keep seeing that I need to use htmls or something which seems a bit overwhelming and not within the options as I said, considering it needs to work just by plugging the drive into any computer.p  pAnyway, how can I fix this and win over my potential datep  pCode as followsp  precodepackage Runner  import java.applet. import java.awt. import java.awt.event. import javax.swing.  public class mainRunner extends Applet implements ActionListener       public mainRunner         Label Promnew Label Prom         JButton BYesnew JButtonYes         JButton BNonew JButtonNo         JButton YYesnew JButtonWhy yes         JButton YNonew JButtonWhy no          BYes.addActionListenernew ActionListener             public void actionPerformedActionEvent Yes                 code...

Negative 531 pI am so incredibly confused by this. Ive struggled with this before, but once I figured it out, I didnt really have any more problems. But now, its shown up again. Basically, I have some code which reads a file in as an Image. However, only certain images are readable. Specifically, I can only access images which have been added to the project folder after I refactored to include all files in the source folder they had previously been outside, but still included in the JAR. Ive since managed to fix it by creating copies of the problem folders, deleting the originals, then effectively renaming the copies to the same name as the originals, but Im still curious as to why this would happen.

The answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12351531560450httpstackoverflow.coma12351531560450a quoted the C11 standard on this matterp  blockquote   p6.42 The rules for conditions apply both to selectionstatements and to the for and while statementsp      p6.43 If the name is redeclared in the outermost block of a substatement controlled by the condition, the declaration that   redeclares the name is illformed.p      p6.5.31 names declared in the forinitstatement are in the same declarativeregion as those declared in the conditionp blockquote  pTherefore, I am no more curious about why this is illegal C.  I would just like to get it compilep  pI looked at Gs options related to language dialects. According to the a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.8.1gccC002b002bDialectOptions.htmlC002b002bDialectOptions relnofollow titleGCC 4.8.1 Online Documentation 3.5 Options Controlling C Dialectmanuala,p  blockquote   pIf codefforscopecode is specified, the scope of variables declared in a   emforinitstatementem is limited to the codeforcode loop itself, as specified   by the C standard. If codefnoforscopecode is specified, the scope of   variables declared in a emforinitstatementem extends to the end of the   enclosing scope, as was the case in old versions of G, and other   traditional implementations of C.p blockquote  pThis is the only even remotely relatedsounding option I could find. Oddly enough, passing codefnoforscopecode to codegcode makes the example compile with no warnings even with codeWall Wextracode. However, back to the code I would like to compile, this option generates many errors, because the variables initialized in a emforinitstatementem now have there scope extended. Clearly, this is not the solution.p  pemJust to clarify I am not looking to compile C99 code with a C compiler, that would be foolish. I have some C code codegit blamecode tells that the line with the redeclaration is from 2001. I would like to compile a commit which was tagged for release in 2011, therefore, I presume it was not broken at that time.emp  pWhat could I do to get it compile without modifications Currently, I cherrypick a commit that that renames the offending variable, but I would prefer to pass something in codeCXXFLAGScode to codeconfigurecode. More generally, why does or did codegcode have this behaviour with codefnoforscopecode and the redeclarationsp  pstrongEDITstrong Okay, probably I should have been more explicit. The fact that I have some code form 2001 which is broken today is just to set some context. The presentday codemastercode of the repository, of course, compiles without any compiler trickery. However, I am interested in how could I make codegcode behave as it behaved historically, because there is an overwhelming probability that the time the commit in question was tagged, codegcode accepted this kind of code.p  pstrongEDIT2strong After playing around with codefdumptreeoriginalcode, the question basically becomes emWas there any C standard or nonstandard C implementation in GCC, preferably in which in a variable declared in a codeforinitstatementcode lived in a different scope than either the loop body or the sorrounding codeemp

Negative 531 pThis challenge is a a hrefhttpwww.logic.atprologmst.pdf relnofollowSocial Golfer Problema scenario.  I have a company with 320 persons. I recently implemented a Management By Objectives MBO program where each worker is assigned goals to be completed on a monthly basis. One of the recurring goals is to arrive on time at work to attend a 30 minute coffee and dounut meeting each morning. The meeting is held in our dinning hall which has 50 tables. Each table can seat up to 8 persons maximum. Plus or minus 80 seats are empty each workday, as theres currently a max capacity for 400. I want to generate a round robin seating arrangement so that each person can meet and collaborate with every other person on a rotating basis. p  pstrongEDITstrong RULE Unique sets of 8 people are required for each workday. A person cannot  be seated again with other persons they have sat with in the past until all possible permutations have been exhausted.p  pstrongEDITstrong An example of the desired result is p  precodeDay 1   Table 1 will seat worker numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Table 2 will seat worker numbers 9.10,11,12,13,14,15,16 ... Table 50 will seat worker numbers 313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320   NOTE So, the next workday and thereafter, workers 1 through 8 cannot ever be seated with  any other workers from that same set until all possible permutations have been exhausted.  Day 2  Table 1 will seat worker numbers 1,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 Table 2 will seat worker numbers 2,10,24,25,26,27,28,29 ... Table 50 will seat worker numbers 305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312   Day N  . . ... . codepre  pNone of the worker numbers elements can repeat in each set array of 8 workers until all possible unique sets permutations have been exhausted. Then the cycle starts all over again, perhaps shifting the elements, only then, a worker would be seated with another worker theyve met before. I would then want to email each worker as to what table theyve been assigned to sit at the next work day. Each worker will not know who else is sittibg at their assigned table until they arrive at the table. Only I will have the complete roster for the seating arrangements. Its sort of a Musical Chairs game  p  pThis is not an excersise or school assignment.  A friend who uses the APL programming language told me she could generate the desired results with one line of code, but we only use SQLbased DBMS IBM Informix 11.70 and Oracle 11.p  pSo I have an SQL table with the following columnsp  precodeemployee.id        INT      unique primary key employee.FullName  VARCHAR ... codepre  pThe following one line of APL programming code generates matrix permutationsp  precodepmat2,[2]io,1.11 codepre  pIn SQL, can I generate the desired results with one SELECT statement, do I need multiple SELECT INTO TEMP statements, or is a stored procedure required to obtain the desired results  p  pWhat should my SELECT statements or SP look likep  pstrongEDITstrong If the desired result is not feasable with SQL, could it be accomplished with a 3GL like cp

Negative 531 pIm having difficulty debugging my audio slider. Im pretty sure my problems lies in the fact that one of my methods, codechangeVolumeRedFireballcode is just constantly repeating at a very fast rate. I get a glitchy sound every once in a while in my game, so it seems to correlate. I traced output inside the method and quickly found out its repeating at a high rate. p  pProblem is, I cannot figure out WHERE this is coming from One other note. This only starts repeating once I hold down my slider, hence activating the codechangeVolumeRedFireballcode from codedragSliderRedFireballcodep  pI do have other methods from other classes referencing methods in this class. They only access codeplaySoundRedFireballcode and codestopSoundRedFireballcode though, so I dont see why that would have any effect.

Negative 531 pI just have a quick question. If we have two decisions problems, say L1 and L2. If L1 and can be reduced to L2 in polynomial time, then is it true that L2 CANNOT be reduced to L1 in polynomial timep  pMy understanding is that this would meanp  precodeL1 can be reduced to L2 in polynomial time gt NOT L2 can be reduced to L1 in polynomial time L1 not in P amp L2 in P gt L1 in P amp L2 not in P [L1 in P OR L2 not in P] OR [L1 in P amp L2 in P] L1 in P OR L2 not in P codepre  pSo the statement that L1 can be reduced to L2 in polytime implies that L2 cannot be reduced to L1 in polytime is only true if L1 is in P or if L2 is not in P. As in there, if that is not the case, then the statement is false.p  pDoes my logic make sense or am I way off Any advice or help would be much appreciated. Thank youp

Because I am using RGB color model, and in RGB, black is represented as 0,0,0 and white as 255,255,255 and gray color also has some red component in it, so it also gets detected by the algorithm. I dont know the algorithm which exactly pinpoints the red color ignoring others. p  pPlease help me detect only red color and its other shades in any image. p

Negative 531 pI have a tableview with a UISegmentedControl as a subview on each row cell.  Before iOS 7 I could scroll up and down freely without any finger contact being interpreted as a tap on a segment.  Now, emonlyem on iOS7, I cannot scroll without unwanted firing of setSelectedSegmetIndex.  If the user is not paying attention they unknowingly change settings when simply intending to scroll.  Any way to prevent this  I am using Xcode 5 targeting iOS 6 builds, and bc of our customer base need to be able to do this, since some will not have upgraded. If I target iOS 7 things work as usual, it only seems to be when iOS 6 targeted builds are run on a device upgraded to iOS 7.p

Negative 531 pOkay so I am gathering data from a database and using it to create a google visualization line chart. The user can select year intervals and a month.

For example, if the user selects 19901992 and January, the json array variable will look like thisp  precode[[1990,157894],[1991,173725],[1992,181227]]  codepre  pThen I import the json variable into my javascript p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  var inputData  [[1990,157894],[1991,173725],[1992,181227]]  var month  January     google.loadvisualization, 1, packages[corechart]   google.setOnLoadCallbackdrawChart   function drawChart      var data  new google.visualization.DataTable   data.addColumnnumber, Year   data.addColumnnumber, month   data.addRowsinputData      var formatter  new google.visualization.NumberFormatgroupingSymbol ,, fractionDigits 0     formatter.formatdata, 1        var options         title Unemployed Statistics,       hAxis title Year, format ,    vAxis title Number of Unemployed,           var chart  new google.visualization.LineChartdocument.getElementByIdchartdiv     chart.drawdata, options    ltscriptgt codepre  pAnd from there I am able to create my graph.

I guess my question is how do I go about changing the year values instead of all being the same 1990 for all to now having different values based on the month January 1990 lt February 1990 lt December 1990 p

Also, should there be a check, like suppose 100 of x, 20 of y and 30 of z are distributed, then subtract the value for the next day I have 1400 of x, 980 of y and 870 of z available for distribution as this will change the permutation values p  pThank you guys p

Negative 531 pI have an older ASP.NET WebForms application that is trying to authenticate users. The application works perfectly in staging and production. However, when attempting to use IISExpress to debug locally, it doesnt. p  pTheres a user control that is placed within a master page that contains a Login server control. The Login server control has a custom template and calls strongLoginControlAuthenticatestrong during the strongOnAuthenticatestrong event. There is one other server event called strongLoginControlLoggedInstrong that is called during the strongOnLoggedInstrong event. Heres the code for those two methodsp  precodePrivate Sub LoginControlLoggedInByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs     Response.RedirectVerifyAuthentication.aspx, True End Sub  Private Sub LoginControlAuthenticateByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AuthenticateEventArgs     Dim loginCtrl As Login  CTypeLoginContainer.FindControlLoginControl, Login     Dim username As String  loginCtrl.UserName     Dim password As String  loginCtrl.Password     e.Authenticated  Membership.ValidateUserusername, password End Sub codepre  pThe VerifyAuthentication.aspx page is supposed to then validate the user and do some crazy profile population. On strongPageLoadstrong, the first statement is to check strongUser.Identity.IsAuthenticatedstrong. Again, locally, this is returning strongFalsestrong every time. However, in production, it works as expected. Below is a snippet of this methodp  precodePrivate Sub PageLoads as Object, e as EventArgs     If User.Identity.IsAuthenticated  False Then         ...     End If     ...

Negative 531 pI dont know if I am using the correct terminology in my question, sorry in advance if it sounds a bit confusing. So basically I am trying to write a Java Swing program to create a GUI.

I have created so many layers that I dont know how to backtrack and access that the pics so I can flip the CardLayout of the 2 images in the other panel.p  pI hope I was clear enough and any help would be much appreciated.

Negative 531 pI am currently making a static site into a dynamic one and have been using codeigniter to do this without any problem .. until now.p  pThe problem I have is that I want to have one view webpage that acts as a template file and pulls in dynamic data from my database depending on what link was clicked.p  pIn the website there is a strongoverview jobs pagestrong where it has a sidebar that lists all current vacancies. What I want is when a user clicks on one of these links it will load the template file and pull in all the data job description, job title etc that relates to that job.p  pI dont think that I am to far away from achieving this but I am having some problems. p  pFirst I have created a function in the controllerstrongsitestrong which loads a model and function stronggetJobInfostrong that gets the job title from the database depending on the location. Then it gets the header, nav,  content and pulls of of it into the view named strongjobsstrong.p  pIn the jobs overview page I have used a foreach statement to load in the job title which will be used as the link to click on, here it will then load the template file with all the related data. In this foreach statement I have used a codeigniter anchor statement to load a new function strongjob positionstrong back in the controller, this will be used to display and get all of the job specific information. I have also passed in the jobs listing id as the third segment of the anchor which will be used by a new model in the new site controller function strongjob positionstrong where it will only show the related information to that id where query.p  pIf that makes no sence hopfully this will clarify.p  pstrongController  job overview functionstrongp  precodepublic function jobs thisgtloadgtmodelgetdb data[jobheader]  thisgtgetdbgtgetJobHeader3 data[joblocationlisting]  thisgtgetdbgtgetJobLocationListingmanchester data[header]  thisgtgetdbgtgetHeaders3 data[content]  thisgtgetdbgtgetContent2 thisgtloadgtviewheader, data thisgtloadgtviewnav thisgtloadgtviewjobs, data  codepre  pstrongModel  get job titlestrongp  precodepublic function getJobLocationListingjoblocation query  thisgtdbgtquerySELECT joblocation, joblistingid, jobtitle  FROM joblocation INNER JOIN joblisting ON joblocation.joblocationid  joblisting.joblocationid WHERE joblocation  joblocation  return querygtresult  codepre  pstrongView  jobsstrong p  precodeltulgt ltphp foreachjoblocationlisting as row      title  rowgtjobtitle gt ltligt ltphp    echo anchorsitejobPositionrowgtjoblistingid, title gt ltligt ltphp  gt ltulgt codepre  pstrongController  job position functionstrongp  precodepublic function jobPosition thisgtloadgtmodelgetdb data[jobposition]  thisgtgetdbgtgetJobInfo thisgtloadgtviewheader, data thisgtloadgtviewnav thisgtloadgtviewjobTemplate, data  codepre  pstrongModel  get job infostrong p  precodepublic function getJobInfo query  thisgtdbgtwherejoblistingid, thisgturigtsegment3 thisgtdbgtgetjoblisting return querygtresult  codepre  pstrongView  job position  templatestrong p  precodeltphp foreachjobposition as row     jobtitle  rowgtjobtitle   jobdescription  rowgtjobdescription  gt   h1gtltphp echo jobtitle gtlth1gt  ltpgtltphp echo jobdescription gtltpgt codepre  pThe problem I have is that the anchor tag is loading the function  sitejobPositionand the id number   e.g sitejobPosition1.

Negative 531 pSo I have a unique iOS project read as clients accepted a design before I started working here and the design contains checkboxes, dropdowns, tabular data rowscolumns,etc. which requires a long tableview which contains 3 sections, the sections themselves vary from 50700pt. p  pIt appears this wasnt something Apple took into account as the table view does not scroll properly to all cells, specifically, when the keyboard is not yet open and I click on a textfield at the bottom of a long section it scrolls to entirely the wrong section.p  pIm curious if there is something obvious Im missing, Ive tried using the library a hrefhttpsgithub.commichaeltysonTPKeyboardAvoiding relnofollowTPKeyboardAvoidinga to no avail, it sounds very promising but also doesnt handle my situation. p  pId prefer to stick with a table view instead of a scrollview as Ive already built out and handled headers, certain events, etc.p  pALSO, after reading other posts it may be pertinent that Im in landscape mode only on iPads and this tableview  controller is inside a container controller so its size is fixed at 984x543p

Negative 531 pI am trying to use jQuerys fadeInfadeOut effects on images that are being used as buttons in an unordered list.  I want to be able to have the hovered image fade in quickly and out slowly on mouseout.  The problem I am having is that I am trying to do this as horizontal menu with floated codeltligtcode tags.  I created a jsfiddle with as simple of an example as I could.  The list in the example contains only 1 list item, but it will actually have 4 or 5.  p  pIn order to position the hover images I have created a second codeltulgtcode so that it is positioned on top of the other list.  What is happening now is that when hovered it does the fadeIn fadeOut twice.  I assume that this is happening once for each of the codeltulgtcode.p  pIs there something I can do to position two images on top of each other, within the same codeltligtcode  Or anotherbetter way altogether to accomplish this  Any help is appreciated.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netQb97f relnofollowDEMOap

I also found some change logs saying that this function has been removed, and I found some header documentation stating the followingp  precodeThe ref counting scheme allows the IOBluetoothObjectRefs to be freed  when they are no longer used. When the ref count reaches zero,  the target object will be freed.        DEPRECATED IN BLUETOOTH 2.2 Mac OS X 10.6        You should transition your code to ObjectiveC equivalents.        This API may be removed any time in the future. codepre  pBased on this, my questions arep  ul liWhy is the Mac documentation using a deprecated functionli liWhat is the ObjectiveC equivalentli ul

In SVN they are shown at the right place in the log where they belong, no matter how long later I created them.p  pIt seems like this has to do something with that reposurgeon adds a commit for .gitignore in each tag that looks like thisp  precode A simulation of Subversion default ignores, generated by reposurgeon. .o .lo ... .pyo .rej  . ..swp .DSstore  The contents of the svnignoreproperty on the branch root.  nbproject .project codepre  pHow can I make reposurgeon not create such a commit for gitignore in all tags And let it create simple tags that dont appear in the timeline as a commitp  pThe a hrefhttpwww.catb.orgesrreposurgeonreposurgeon.html relnofollowreposurgeon manual saisap  blockquote   pstrongusergenerated .gitignorestrongp      pThis message means means reposurgeon has found a .gitignore file in the Subversion repository it is analyzing. This probably happened   because somebody was using gitsvn as a live gateway, and created   ignores which may or may not be congruent with those in the generated   .gitignore files that the Subversion ignore properties will be   translated into. Youll need to make a policy decision about which set   of ignores to use in the conversion, and possibly to delete either the   generated .gitignore files or the usercreated ones.p blockquote  pBut no example how to make that decision.

In the other file I just have codelatitude, longitudecode and I am trying to find an efficient way to search where are those thousand of points of the 2nd file.  I am using for matching the coordinates just 4 decimals, but occasionally I will need to reduce to 3 for those which didnt match and interpolate them. p  pMy question is if you know a structure alternative to make those searches and access no eternal.p  pI was thinking in for both files with a codeStreamReadercode, to access with codeReadLinecode, codesplitcode the line and compare them making a loop. If they match then write the km in my 2nd file. This could be a bit improved searching first if the longitude it changes much more than latitude of the line being iterated matches and so check the longitude.p  pMaybe storing all the first file in a codeDictionaryltltlatitude,longitudegt,kmgtcode would improve somethingp

Negative 531 pI have a neo4j database containing some 120 million nodes. I am using the traversal framework to traverse through my graph and count the occurence of certain nodes.

For each of these children files I check the entire subtree for the occurence of a certain node.p  pI was under the understanding that using p  precodetryTransaction tx   codepre  pautomatically closed my transaction, but my heap is still full.

Negative 531 pI need to use CyaSSL on Android for a project Im working on. Ive been trying, without much success to follow CyaSSLs instructions to build it into the kernel. The main issue is the build structure seems to have changed significantly from the version of Android the instructions were written for, to the current version. p  pIll list the steps and the associated problems.p  p1 Copy the cyassl directory from srcexternalcyassl of the provider to the external directory of the Android platform. This folder should be now located at externalcyasslp  pThis step is fine. p  p2 Open buildcoreprelinklinuxmap.map and add a new entry for libcyassl.so under the heading  libraries for specific apps or temporary libraries.  It should look similar to the following ibcyassl.so p  pThis step seems to be unnecessary with the latest versions of Android, since the prelinking has been removed. p  p3 Open the file dalviklibnativehelperAndroid.mk and add libcyassl.so to the sharedlibraries list.p  pThis file looks to have moved, I found what I think is the correct file under WORKINGDIRECTORYlibnativehelperAndroid.mk and edited accordingly. p  p4 Copy the yassl directory from srclibcoreyassl of the provider source to the libcore directory of the Android platform. This folder should now be located at libcoreyasslp  pNo problem here.p  p5 The SSL Provider initilization method must be registered with the Android platform. Open the file dalviklibnativehelperRegister.c. Add the registercomyasslxnetproviderjsseNativeCrypto method under the entry for the existing provider. When added, it should look as followsp  precodeif registerorgapacheharmonyxnetproviderjsseNativeCryptoenv  0     goto bail if registercomyasslxnetproviderjsseNativeCryptoenv  0     goto bail codepre  pThis file, Register.c does not exist, and Ive no idea what to do with step 5. p  p6 The provider initialization method must also be added to the header file at dalviklibnativehelperincludenativehelperAndroidSystemNatives.h. Add the following method declaration to this file under the declaration for the existing SSL provider. When added, it should look as followsp  precodeint registerorgapacheharmonyxnetproviderjsseNativeCryptoJNIEnv env int registercomyasslxnetproviderjseeNativeCryptoJNIEnv env codepre  pThis file, AndroidSystemNatives.h also doesnt seem to exist, so again, not sure what to do here. p  p7 Open the security.properties file located at libcoresecuritsrcmainjavajavasecuritysecurity.properties. Make the following changes to configure the CyaSSL providerp  pa Add the following line to the list of providers. This line needs to be above the default org.apache.harmony.xnet.provider.jsse.JSSEProvider provider.  Note the numbers beside each provider.It might be necessary to renumber this list after inserting the new provider.p  precodesecurity.provider.3com.yassl.xnet.provider.jsse.JSSEProvider codepre  pb Change the ssl.SocketFactory.provider entry to the new CyaSSL Provider.  After modification, it should read as followsp  precode ssl.SocketFactory.providercom.yassl.xnet.provider.jsse.SocketFactoryImpl codepre  pThis file now seems to be at libcorelunisrcmainjavajavasecurity which I edited accordingly. However, it wont build due to the missing steps that I dont know how to handle. Ive done quite a bit of searching and came up with nothing useful. My options seem to be at this point  p  p1 Get the above working. p  p2 Revert to building an older version of Android and all the associated hassle that goes with, downgrading Java, Gcc, pyhton etcp  p3 Find a way to use the CyaSSL Android library without baking it into the kernel Im not sure if this is possible p  pAny advice or direction would be much appreciated. p

I figured out how to include nominal variables but I do not see how to include information about positive numeric variables.

So the next time, when he visits the page, his username amp password is already filled in the filed. Now comes the problem, even though the web browser chrome, firefox automatically filled in the form for the user, the button is still disabled. For enabling the button, user needs to enter any one of fields even a single alphabet of the fields for enabling that button. Technically speaking, this is not right. As data is already filled in the form by the browser, the button has to be enabled. Any suggestions to make it as like thatp

Negative 531 pstrongSimplified questionstrongp  pIs there a difference in timing of memory caches coherency or flushing caused by Interlocked operations compared to Memory barriers Lets consider in C  any Interlocked operations vs Thread.MemoryBarrier.

Negative 531 pI am having a basic question for like best practise.p  pThe setupp  pListViewController UiTableView with ManagedObjects. The objects will be loaded from a server. First load 20 objects. Scroll to the end of the table, the next 20 objects will be loaded. Selecting a cell will load the DetailViewController. I have a ListObject with an array of the items and other properties with informations about the list, not relevant for the DetailVCp  pDetailViewController The details of the selected object are shown. The VC also has 2 buttons to show the next object details  or the previous object.p  pNow e.g. there are 20 objects loaded in the ListVC and I select row 10, the DetailVC with Object at index 10 will show. Then I click trough the next objects until object number 20. Now when i click the next Button, the next 20 objects have to be loaded from the server. Show object 21 but there are only 20 objects loaded.p  pIs there a best practice to load the next objects I have a class for data loading.  voidloadDataWithRequestcompletionHandler When the NSUrlSession DownloadTask finishes, the completionHandler gets called and this calls the class ApiParser for json parsing and adds the result to the List Object.p  pSo i have to call this in the DetailVC for the next 20 objects.p  pNow what is the best practice to do this Or is there a better way to implement the data loadingp  pI could pass a ListVC reference to the DetailVC and call [listvc loadDataWithRequestcompletionhandler] and load the detail from [listvc.listobject.items objectAtIndex]p  pOr i just could pass the ListObjectItems to the detailVC. Somehow load the new objects and  have a KVO to the ListObjectItems count.p  pOther methods would be delegates or NotificationCenter.p  pBut i guess the best practice is not to put the loadData Method in the ListVC, but somewhere else.p  pHow about to put the dataLoad method as instance method in the ListObject class and listen for the KVO in ListVC and DetailVCp  pSo many possibilities.

Negative 531 pim new to python. this code snippet takes a list of length 25 devinfolines and finds parts of strings and assigns them to properties of the dev object. it seems very straightforward. however the for loop will only iterate once even though there are 25 lines in the list. whyp  pim sure im missing something obvious, i started coding in python just yesterday.p  pEDIT Fixed my code with the error found by the community, maybe this operational function will be useful to someone else. In case youre wondering, my return dev line was indented inside the for loop, ending it and the function prematurely.

Negative 531 pMy title is probably a bit vague so I try to specify  I work in a statistical institute, and therefore I have to work on databases. I now know somewhat well how to use statistical softwares let say SAS as it is the one I use the most, but I never had any particular programming training except basic learning of a few languages. p  pSo when working on a big project, I am not sure how to put together the different pieces of the puzzle. To be even more specific, I am at the end of a project that have kept me busy for a few months, and which involve 5 different source databases and a few thousands lines of code. But I find myself mostly improving the first draw I made at the beginning, even if I have now a better comprehension of my problem. p  pBut even then, I am not sure today what would be the best way to implement the solutions note that I am aware that there is probably not A unique best way, but there are probably nevertheless some ways that are better than others.p  pMy question is then is there guidelines, methods,  or principles that should drive my work as a whole   Any reference would be welcome.p

What I need to find is the area containted in the graph in number of open or unfilled units.p  h3Solution Pt.1h3  pTo go about this I made an algorithm to calculate all the peaks in the array.p  pThis returns  code[5, 7, 3, 12]code as well as another list with the indices of each entry, code[0,3,5,7]codep  pTo us, there are only three important peaks to find the area.

THis makes sense because if you look at the graph you see there is an empty L shaped section that you could fit 3 units of say, water in without it overflowing.  If you repeat this with the second section you get its correct area as well.p  h2My issue is developing an algorithm to go from codeALL PEAKScode to the codeIMPORTANT PEAKScode.h2  h2Misleadingh2  pIn this case it is extremely easy to see how that could be done. You simply write an algo to find that the code3code is smaller than the code7code and the code12code so get rid of it and return a refined version of the peaks.p  pHowever it is not always that simple.p  h3More Difficult Exampleh3  pI have an arrayp  pcode[5, 4, 3, 7, 2, 3, 1, 12, 9, 10, 5, 3, 6, 8, 5, 6, 4, 7, 6, 9, 4, 11, 11, 4, 1, 2, 1]codep  pRunning it through a basic custom peak finding algorithm codeONcode It returnsp  pcode[5, 7, 3, 12, 10, 8, 6, 7, 9, 11, 11, 4, 2]codep  pIn this example, we see the same problem in the first part of this question, however, after the code12code in this peak list, a human can easily see that the next most important peak to look at are the two code11scode, the code4code, and code2code.

As reflected in comments, subsequent test on 4.4.4 emulator is not able to replicate the error. strongSo far, error only observed on actual Samsung G5 with 4.4.4.strongp  h3UPDATEh3  pBased on a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27891436incorrectjavaopensourceviewwhensteppingineclipsewithlivedeviceconneclabor intensive debug step processa of mapping a good source view 4.4.4 emulator with the Samsung incorrect source view, we have narrowed in on the cause of the NPE. The app throws an NPE when it calls StartTaskActivity.setActivityVisible, which eventually runs into a null object. Because of the limits to the tracing process, I cant say with certainty what that object is, but my guess is that it is the window, or view. The line of code that throws it is mDecor.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE line 4355 in Samsung  line 4143 in Emulator of Activity.java. So, technically, some part of the mDecor object is null. p  pWill probably take a different approach to achieve our goal, since we cannot determine why the Samsung v4.4.4 throws NPE when no other deviceemulator seems to, including Samsung v4.4.2. Perhaps even though this question is unresolved, it might be useful to others in the future.p

Negative 531 pI have developed a module which authorizes the roles from the database dynamically. Now, what i want is,when a user comes and browses different actionmethod without logging in, I am able to redirect the user to the login page.

Negative 531 pIm using Python to run a .ksh script, using subprocess.call.p  pThis script requires the user to enter text at certain points  whatever the equivalent of Pythons input is in KSH I guess.p  pThe problem Im having is that I have to run the script 200 times, and I dont want to have to enter this information each time. Is there anyway that I can set it up so that these requests for user input are automatically given some value each time without the user even needing to do anythingp  pIm pretty new to using Python at the shell in this way, so apologies if this question doesnt make sense. Happy to take any feedback. I havent found this question asked previously  mostly people ask about passing arguments to the script  but I may have missed something as I was having trouble finding the key search terms.p  pThe Python version is 2.7, and its a UNIX environment.p

Negative 531 pI have a one page horizontal sliding website for mobile only. It gives an impression of a mobile app. So if I click a button An  tag in one section, it slides to another by jQuery. All pages has buttons for navigation to different sections.

So, if I slide to section2 and then click browsers back button I want to slide back to section1. It means that somehow I have to detect browsers backforward button click event and trigger my jQuery functions accordingly. Some basic idea would be very nice. Thanks.p
Negative 531 pI have a simple codeUITableViewControllercode with a codeNavigationControllercode as the root view controller. I have added an Options codeUIBarButtonItemcode to the navigation bar and a Start codeUIBarButtonItemcode to the toolbar, shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtuKlq.png altenter image description herep  p.

I thought using setters and getters methods but could not implement it correctly.p  pHere is a sample code with two subpanels BASE CLASSp  precode   public Base             frame.setLayoutbl             frame.setSize800, 600             frame.addnew MainPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER              frame.setLocationRelativeTonull             frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE             frame.setVisibletrue                  public static void mainString[] args               TODO code application logic here             new Base               codepre  pMainPanel subpanels holderp  precodeclass MainPanel extends JPanel     private CardLayout cl  new CardLayout     private JPanel panelHolder  new JPanelcl      public MainPanel          ChooseFile chooseFile  new ChooseFilethis         ShowResult showResult  new ShowResultthis          panelHolder.addshowResult, showResult         panelHolder.addchooseFile, chooseFile          cl.showpanelHolder, chooseFile         addpanelHolder          public void showPanelString panelIdentifier         cl.showpanelHolder, panelIdentifier       codepre  pSubPanel 1p  precodeclass ChooseFile extends JPanel     MainPanel ob2     JPanel directoryChooserPanel, bottomPanel     JButton btn, localSourceBack, localSourceNext     JTextField field     public ChooseFileMainPanel mainPanel         this.ob2  mainPanel         ShowResult showResult  new ShowResult         setLayoutnew BorderLayout          directoryChooserPanel  new JPanelnew GridLayout0,2         btn  new JButtonBrowse         btn.addActionListenernew ActionListener             Override             public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                 JFileChooser chooser  new JFileChooserDDesktop                 chooser.setFileSelectionModeJFileChooser.DIRECTORIESONLY                 int returnVal  chooser.showOpenDialognull                 ifreturnVal  JFileChooser.APPROVEOPTION                     File myFile  chooser.getSelectedFile                     String text  myFile                        field.setTexttext                                                   directoryChooserPanel.addbtn          field  new JTextField20         directoryChooserPanel.addfield            localSourceNext  new JButtonNext         localSourceNext.addActionListenernew ActionListener             Override             public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                 ob2.showPanelshowResult                 showResult.setRootgetPath                                adddirectoryChooserPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH         addlocalSourceNext, BorderLayout.EAST          public String getPath         return field.getText       codepre  pSub Panel 2p  precodeclass ShowResult extends JPanel     MainPanel ob2     JPanel bottomPanel, labelsPanel     JButton srcLocalBTN, srcFtpBTN, sourceLocationBack     JLabel result     File directory     String root     ArrayListltStringgt myFiles  new ArrayListltStringgt     public ShowResultMainPanel mainPanel         this.ob2  mainPanel         setLayoutnew BorderLayout         result  new JLabel         root  No ADDRESS         directory  new Fileroot          listFilesdirectory, myFiles         String filesNumber  It contains   myFiles.size   files.         result.setTextfilesNumber          addresult, BorderLayout.NORTH           public void listFilesFile directory, ArrayListltStringgt list             forFile file  directory.listFiles                 list.addfile.getName                 iffile.isDirectory                     listFilesfile.getAbsoluteFile, list                                        public ShowResult           public void setRootString chosenPath         root  chosenPath       codepre  pSo it firsts loads sub panel 1 so user chooses a directory by codejFileChoosercode and then I need to transfer this data to sub panel 2.

Negative 531 pWe have a SQL Server 2012 table defined like sop  precodecreate table Files      id int identity1,1,     folderId int not null,     fileName nvarchar256,     [...],     constraint PKFiles primary key nonclustered id  codepre  pWe have a fulltext catalog with an index on Files.fileName. Searching works ok, except wed like to allow users to fulltext search for files inside a specific folder. This should be super fast any specific folder would only have a fraction of the number of files in the entire Files table.p  pAlas, it seems that the query returns all the rows matching our fileName fulltext search first, and only then filters them by folderId. For example, searching forp  precodeselect  from Files where containsfileName, file and folderId  5 codepre  preturns 75,000 rows for the fulltext search, and then filters them down using folderId to 9 rows. It takes 19 seconds to run. The entire folder only has about 285 files, so doing the fulltext search against just those 285 files would be much better.p  pHow would one go about doing thatp

Negative 531 pIm trying to get 9bit serial working for communication with a device that requires the 9th bit set high in order to receive yea, I know....p  pIm using a pretty standard USBRS232 dongle with an FTDI chip in it and it appears to be using the FTDI drivers on the system.p  pIve been using a hrefhttpsviereck.chlinuxmarkspaceparity relnofollowthisa guide for MARKSPACE parity which my research suggests is the only way to go  and basing my code off of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6947413howtoopenreadandwritefromserialportincthisa which Ive been lead to believe is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25996171linuxblockingvsnonblockingserialread2600668026006680terriblea but, hey, thats never stopped me before.p  pIm pretty sure at this point that the Linux FTDI drivers completely ignore CMSPAR but if anyone knows otherwise, your input would be greatly appreciated.  I do know for a fact that the strongFTDI dongle I have can, in a limited capacity, support 9bit serial as I have the dongle working fine on a windows machinestrong.p  pAssuming nobody has a magical answer to all of this, the main question Im asking becomes, how difficult it would be to fix the FTDI driver, if necessary, to work  Additionally, where would be a good place to start for someone with limited experience with linux device drivers  Assuming all goes well, it seems Im not the only person with this problem so it would be great to contribute something, however small, to the community.p

I use the boost library to handle with the quaternionsp  pHere is my code for itp  precodeboostmathquaternionltdoublegt translation, quaternionRotation Get Transformation translation  boostmathquaternionltdoublegt0.0, lineData[2].toDouble, lineData[3].toDouble, lineData[4].toDouble quaternionRotation  boostmathquaternionltdoublegtlineData[5].toDouble,lineData[6].toDouble,lineData[7].toDouble,lineData[8].toDouble  do some file related stuff  ...  for each line read the point data and transform it and store the point in a data array pointData[j].x  stringPointData[0].toDouble pointData[j].y  stringPointData[1].toDouble pointData[j].z  stringPointData[2].toDouble tmpQuat  boostmathquaternionltdoublegt 0.0,pointData[j].x,pointData[j].y,pointData[j].z first translation tmpQuat  translation then quaternion rotation tmpQuat  quaternionRotation  tmpQuat  boostmathconjquaternionRotation read the data from quaternion to a usual type pointData[j].x  tmpQuat.Rcomponent2 pointData[j].y  tmpQuat.Rcomponent3 pointData[j].z  tmpQuat.Rcomponent4 codepre  pI assume that the first component of the quaternion is the codewcode component and the others refers to codexcode, codeycode andcodezcode like in equation 2 from a hrefhttpwww.gamasutra.comviewfeature131686rotatingobjectsusingquaternions.php relnofollowherea. If necessary I can provide the screenshots of the false transformations.p  pEDIT It is written in the source code of zipper in the file zipper.c, that the 7 values are saved as followedp  precodetransX transY transZ quatX quatY quatZ quatW codepre  pThe quaternion is then transformed into a rotation matrix and then the rotation is performed with this new matrix. But even with this information, I am not able to transform it correctly.

Negative 531 pI am trying to start Tomcat7 as a service. I am able to start in cmd prompt using codesc start tomcat7code or codetomcat7w EScode.

When the service is started in cmd prompt, the status is changed to started but StopPause button is not enabled.p
Negative 531 pim doing a web and upon testing it i encountered this , Request Sent by the Client was syntactically incorrect. i dont know which is the one giving the error, but to say, i have a model class that is artist.java. My jsp pages are artist,jsp and artistview.jsp. and it is being controlled by the artistcontroller.java. I am getting this error when i edit a an artist from my artistview.jsp. it is then directed to the edit portion of artist.jsp. after editing the details filling all details again, and i press edit artist, i get the error. i have a hunch that it is coming from the uploadprofilepic method, but cant figure it out. hope you could help me on this. thanks in advance.  here are my codes. p

Negative 531 pI currently have a network where all of the clients are served 192.168.0.0 subnet addresses with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.  Since I am running out of addresses to serve within that subnet, I would like clients to start being served 192.168.4.0 subnet addresses as well, but am unsure of the easiest way to do this.p  pMy current thinking is that I should modify my DHCP server to start serving 192.168.4.0 addresses while modifying all subnet masks being served to 255.255.0.0.  However, I think I would have to go and change any static IP addresses that I have configured to use the new subnet mask in order to communicate with the new subnet.  Is there a way to add this new subnet without having to modify my alreadyexisting static configurations for the 192.168.0.0 subnetp

Negative 531 pI have some kind of web scraper written in PHPCurl for checking geo targeted adcampaigns. But I think it will better to rewrite it using PhantomJS, because some sites have nontrivial javascripts that used for redirection. Using PhantomJs is a good idea, but there is a new problem if page contains script with window.location  ... then browser wont wait while new page loads. Yes, I know about delay and setTimeout before render, but I need to know exactly, is there pending redirects on page or not. Because I have big list of URLs to check and can not wait extra 35 seconds for each of them even there is no pending redirects.p  pNow I try to be more specific When page is loaded, I should call render and determine, is there new active HTTP requests initiated by window.location.., XMLHttpRequest or Meta Refresh. Also I need to know is there any pending setTimeout handlers because window.location call can be delayed with it. If any of this are found, I should catch its completion, otherwise return result.p  pIs it possible with PhantomJSp
