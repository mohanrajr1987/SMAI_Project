Positive 725 pThe config api within Trac is a pretty straight forward way of storing and loading settings from the config file. However, I havent yet found a method to delete a line, or to delete all lines from a category that have no value assigned. So far I can only set the values to False or an empty string to deactivate them.p  pWhat I want to do is remove all values from my plugins category that were set manually in the file and are not accepted by my script, or were set to False or no value by the script. In both ways, the whole line should be removed from the config so that it doesnt contain a lot of lines that look like thisp  precodesomesetting   codepre  pstrongEditstrong br I just found out that I can assign None as value, which comments the setting, and the next time Trac writes to the config file it removes the commented line. This is a possible workaround, but Im still interested in whether a direct method exists.p

Positive 725 pI was wondering how people are handling security aspects when using Spring Cloud Config. Im planning to use Spring Cloud Config Server and Client together with Spring Boot. From an implementation point of view this is quite straight, but how do you deal with the risk of disclosing passwordaccess to every developer.  e.g. you run one central configserver containing configurations for all environment. In the codebootstrap.ymlcode of the config client app youll have to configure the codeusernamecodecodepasswordcode to access the configserver. So far so good, but when I know commit the usernamepassword in the respective yml file, then every developer has potential access to all environments by just switching the profile from e.g. codedevelopmentcode to codeproductioncode please lets not start a discussion why not every developer needs access to production.p  pIm aware that I can encrypt all passwords in the configuration, we do this, but thats not what Im looking for. Encryption is just a feature to not have the passwords being stored plaintext in the files, but the user does not really need to know the plain password to get access if he has access to the configserver in the first place.p  pThis is also about avoiding mistakes during development... its just to easy to switch the local environment to connect to production or any other environment.p  pSo how are people dealing with this Do you inject a different codebootstrap.ymlcode in development then in other environments if so how do you administratepropagate these p  pDo you set the password for the configuration user on the comandline ...p

It detects configuration problems, such as references to nonexistent beans and circular dependencies, at container loadtime. Spring sets properties and resolves dependencies as late as possible, when the bean is actually created. This means that a Spring container which has loaded correctly can later generate an exception when you request an object if there is a problem creating that object or one of its dependencies.emp  pIm not sure how this applies to my code. Can someone help me understand this betterp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 725 pIm not sure Im phrasing this properly, but basically I do this in my main app delegatep  pApplication app  [[Application alloc] initWithApplicationfullPath]p  pThe Application class has an initWithApplication method that takes in the path of an app and then sets the properties for appPath, name, etc. Then I add the new app object to the applications NSMutableArrayp  precodeif app [applications addObject app] codepre  pThe NSArrayControllers content array is bound to the applications NSMutableArray, and then the various keys appPath, name, etc are set in the NSArrayController. I then have a table view with various columns bound to the different properties, e.g. one column for the name, one column from the path, etc.p  pI then have a launch button that launches the app that is selected in the table view. For this I use this codep  precodeApplication app  [applications objectAtIndex[tableView selectedRow]] codepre  pThen I just use app.appPath as a reference to the path of the currently selected item. This works fine. The problem comes in when the table view contents are filtered using a filterPredicate. Basically it filters out all apps in the table view and leaves only the ones with a name that contains the phrase typed into the search box.p  pThe above method does not work because it gets the index of the item in the table view, and since all the items are not in the table view, the count gets messed up. For example say I have an app called MyApp.app which is item at index 25 of the applications array.p  pThe above code works well because the tableView and the applications array have the same number of objects. However filtering out the contents of the table view creates a difference in the number of objects, and therefore it launches the wrong app.p  pI hope my explanation is not too confusing, but its hard to explain. Any way around thisp  pThanksp

Negative 725 pIm creating an iPhone app that will pull data down from a Web API, including email addresses. Id like to display an image associated with each email address in table cells, so Im searching the Address Book for images and falling back on a default if the email address isnt in the book. This works great, but I have a few concernsp  ul lipstrongPerformancestrong The recipes Ive found for looking for an address book record by Email address or phone number are reportedly a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1314430performanceproblemsreadinginiphoneabaddressbook titlePerformance problems reading in iPhone ABAddressBookrather slowa. The reason for this is that one must iterate over every address book record, and for each one that has an image, iterate over all email addresses to find a match. This can be timeconsuming for a large address book, of course.pli lipstrongTable Cellsstrong So I thought Id gather up all the email addresses for which I need to find images and find them all at once. This way I iterate through the book only once for all addresses. But this doesnt work well for table cells, where each cell corresponds to a single email address. Id either have to gather all the images before displaying any cells potentially slow, or have each cell look up each image as it loads even slower, as Id need to iterate through the book to find a match for emeach email addressem.pli lipstrongAsynchronous Lookupstrong So then I thought Id look them up in bulk, but asynchronously, using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.commaclibraryDOCUMENTATIONCocoaReferenceNSInvocationOperationClassReferenceReference.htmlcodeNSInvocationOperationcodea. For each image found in AddressBook, Id save a thumbnail in the app sandbox. Then each cell could just reference this file and show the default if it doesnt exist because its not in the book or hasnt yet been found. If the image is later found in the asynchronous lookup, the next time the image needs to be displayed it would suddenly appear. This might work well for periodic regeneration of images for when images have been changed in the address book, for example. But then for any given instance of my app, an image may not actually show up for a while.pli lipstrongAsynchronous Table Cell Lookupstrong Ideally, Id use something like a hrefhttpwww.markj.netiphoneasynchronoustableimagemarkjnets asynchronous table cell updatinga to update table cells with an image once it has been downloaded. But for this to work, Id have to spin off an codeNSInvocationOperationcode job for each cell as its displayed and if the cached icon is missing from the sandbox. But then were back to inefficiently iterating through the entire address book for each oneand that can be a lot of them if youve just downloaded a whole bunch of new email addresses.pli ul  pSo my question is How do others do this I was fiddling with Tweetie2, and it looks like it updates displayed table cells asynchronously. I assume its sending a separate HTTP request for every image it needs. If so, I imagine that searching the local address book by email address isnt any less efficient, so maybe thats the best approach Just not worry about the performance issues associated with searching the address bookp  pIf so, is saving a thumbnail image in the sandbox the best approach to caching And if I wanted to create a new job to update all the thumbnails with any changes in the address book say once a day, whats the best approach to doing sop  pHow do the rest of you solve this sort of problem Suggestions would be much appreciatedp

Negative 725 pI am using Spring MVC, and am using the UrlFilenameViewController to directly map incoming URLs onto my View Resolver without a controller in between. Im using this to have Freemarker written CSS and JS files, by simply having a .css.ftl and .js.ftl file in the appropriate place. This much all works great.p  pSome browsers seem to have problems with .css files being returned without a Contenttype of textcss, and the Freemarker view resolver doesnt allow for setting the content type of the response based on the view requested. To get around this Ive written my own ViewResolver that looks at the View name and sets the Content Type based on that  so any view name that ends in .css will have a Content Type of textcss. This bit also works great.p  pThe problem is that in order to get my view name to be style.css I need to actually request style.css.css, because the UrlFilenameViewController strips the extension off to get the view name it is using. How do I stop this happening so that style.css actually resolves to a view of style.css and thus to the style.css.ftl templatep

Negative 725 pI am interested in learning more about how people inject logging with dependency injection platforms.  Although the links below and my examples refer to log4net and Unity, I am not necessarily going to use either of those.  For dependency injectionIOC, I will probably use MEF as that is the standard that the rest of the project large is settling on.p  pI am very new to dependency injectionioc and am pretty new to C and .NET have written very little production code in C.NET after the past 10 years or so of VC6 and VB6.  I have done a lot of investigation into the various logging solutions that are out there, so I think that I have a decent handle on their feature sets.  I am just not familiar enough the with actual mechanics of getting one dependency injected or, maybe more correctly, getting an abstracted version of one dependency injected.p  pI have seen other posts related to logging andor dependency injection like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions522370dependencyinjectionandlogginginterfaceshttpstackoverflow.comquestions522370dependencyinjectionandlogginginterfacesap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions576185loggingbestpracticeshttpstackoverflow.comquestions576185loggingbestpracticesap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions166438whatwouldalog4netwrapperclasslooklikehttpstackoverflow.comquestions166438whatwouldalog4netwrapperclasslooklikeap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1320844againaboutlog4netandunityiocconfighttpstackoverflow.comquestions1320844againaboutlog4netandunityiocconfigap  pMy question does not have specifically to do with How to I inject logging platform xxx using ioc tool yyy  Rather, I am interested in how people have handled wrapping the logging platform as is often, but not always recommended and configuration i.e. app.config.  For example, using log4net as an example, I could configure in app.config a number of loggers and then get those loggers without dependency injection in the standard way of using code like thisp  precodeprivate static readonly ILog logger  LogManager.GetLoggerMethodBase.GetCurrentMethod.DeclaringType codepre  pAlternatively, if my logger is not named for a class, but rather, for a functional area, I could do thisp  precodeprivate static readonly ILog logger  LogManager.GetLoggerLogin private static readonly ILog logger  LogManager.GetLoggerQuery private static readonly ILog logger  LogManager.GetLoggerReport codepre  pSo, I guess that my requirements would be something like thisp  ol lipI would like to insulate my products source from a direct dependency on a logging platform.pli lipI would like to be able to resolve a specific named logger instance probably sharing the same instance among all requesters of the same named instance either directly or indirectly by some kind of dependency injection, probably MEF.pli lipI dont know if I would call this a hard requirement, but I would like the ability to get a named logger different than the class logger on demand.  For example, I might create a logger for my class based on the class name, but one method needs particulary heavy diagnostics that I would like to control separately.  In other words, I might want a single class to depend on two separate logger instances.pli ol  pLets start with number 1.  I have read a number of articles, primarily here on stackoverflow, about whether or not it is a good idea to wrap.  See the best practices link above and go to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers55637jeffreyhantinjeffrey hantinas comment for one view about why it is bad to wrap log4net.  If you did wrap and if you could wrap effectively would you wrap strictly for the purpose of injectionremoval of direct depdency  Or would you also try to abstract away some or all of the log4net app.config information  p  pLets say I want to use System.Diagnostics, I would probably want to implement an interfacebased logger maybe even using the common ILoggerILog interface, probably based on TraceSource, so that I could inject it.  Would you implement the interface, say over TraceSource, and just use the System.Diagnostics app.config information as isp  pSomething like thisp  precodepublic class MyLogger  ILogger    private TraceSource ts   public MyLoggerstring name        ts  new TraceSourcename       public void ILogger.Logstring msg        ts.TraceEventmsg     codepre  pAnd use it like thisp  precodeprivate static readonly ILogger logger  new MyLoggerstackoverflow logger.InfoHello world codepre  pMoving on to number 2 ... How to resolve a particular named logger instance  Should I just leverage the app.config information of the logging platform that I choose i.e. resolve the loggers based on the naming scheme in the app.config  So, in the case of log4net, might I prefer to inject LogManager note that I know this is not possible since it is a static object  I could wrap LogManager call it MyLogManager, give it an ILogManager interface, and then resolve MyLogManager.ILogManager interface.  My other objects could have a depenency Import in MEF parlance on ILogManager Export from the assembly where it is implemented.  Now I could have objects like thisp  precodepublic class MyClass    private ILogger logger   public MyClass[ImporttypeofILogManager] logManager        logger  logManager.GetLoggerMyClass     codepre  pAny time ILogManager is called, it would directly delegate to log4nets LogManager.  Alternatively, could the wrapped LogManager take the ILogger instances that it gets based on the app.config and add them to thea  MEF container by name.  Later, when a logger of the same name is requested, the wrapped LogManager is queried for that name.  If the ILogger is there, it is resolved that way.  If this is possible with MEF, is there any benefit do doing sop  pIn this case, really, only ILogManager is injected and it can hand out ILogger instances in the way that log4net normally does.  How does this type of injection essentially of a factory compare to injecting the named logger instances  This does allow for more easy leveraging of log4nets or other logging platform app.config file.p  pI know that I can get named instances out of the MEF container like thisp  precodevar container  new CompositionContainerltcatalogs and other stuffgt ILogger logger  container.GetExportedValueltILoggergtThisLogger codepre  pBut how do I get the named instances into the container  I know about the attribute based model where I could have different implementations of ILogger, each of which is named via a MEF attribute, but that doesnt really help me.  Is there a way to create something like an app.config or a section therein that would list the loggers all of the same implementation by name and that MEF could read  Couldshould there be a central manager like MyLogManager that resolves named loggers via the underlying app.config and then inserts the resolved logger into the MEF container  This way it would be available to someone else that has access to the same MEF container although without the MyLogManagers knowledge of how to use log4nets app.config information, it seems that the container would be unable to resolve any named loggers directly.p  pThis has already gotten pretty long.  I hope it that it is coherent.  Please feel free to share any specific information about how you dependency injected a logging platform we are most likely considering log4net, NLog, or something hopefully thin built on System.Diagnostics into your application.  p  pDid you inject the manager and have it return logger instances  p  pDid you add some of your own config information in your own config section or in your DI platforms config section to make it easierpossible to inject logger instances directly i.e. make your dependencies be on ILogger rather than ILogManager.  p  pWhat about having a static or global container that has either the ILogManager interface in it or the set of named ILogger instances in it.  So, rather than injecting in the conventional sense via constructor, property, or member data, the logging dependency is explicitly resolved on demand.  Is this a good or bad way to dependency inject.p  pI am marking this as a community wiki since it doesnt seem like a question with a definite answer.  If anyone feels otherwise, feel free to change it.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 725 pI have access to a shared web host.  The website installed there uses codeexeccode. About 4 months ago the function was enabled, but now they have put it on the codedisablefunctionscode list. They put codeexeccode, codepassthrucode and codeshellexeccode on that list but they forgot to put codesystemcode This makes me think that the server admin is not very aware on what hes doing. Anyway, they now say that those functions should have never be enabled and they wont reenable them.p  pThe installed website uses codeexeccode to start some php scripts that would do some background work.

Negative 725 pHi I have been using UIViewAnimation for simple animations i the past, now I can see that Apple discourages the use of this Class in 4.0.

When I try to get a grip of the possibilities on the platform I run into a rabbit hole with tons of stuff on Core Animation, Quartz and OPEN GLS, but no simple stuff on animation, to get me started.p  pI need to tween the position, alpha, scale and rotation, sometimes all at once on a few UIViews and have a delegate hook for animationDidStart and didStop. strongAre there any good Tween engines out therestrong  having dealt with flash and Java it is really one of things I miss.p  pIf I use CATransitions it seems I am limited to animating one property at a time, i.e. alpha, if I then have to move and rotate the UIView simultaneous I will have to set up individual animations for each property. strongIf I should go with CATransition, is there a way to build an animation object that animates several properties at oncestrongp  pI would be really grateful if someone can get me started on a way where the complexity of the animation is proportional to the amount of code needed Thanks in advance.p

Negative 725 pand excuse the lack of knowledge on multithreaded apps, but I am new to the field.p  pIs there a pattern or common used methodology for monitoring the job completion or job status of worker threads from a monitor a class that acts as a monitor p  pWhat I have currently done is create a list of workers and create one thread for each worker. After all threads have started i am looping over the worker list and checking their status by making a call to a method.p  pAt that time I couldnt come up with a different solution, but being new to the field, I dont know if this is the way to go, or if there are other solutions or patterns that I should study.p

Negative 725 pIm currently working an application that should have the following behavior  In one of the activities, the user can select different items into a list. While doing that, he should be able to take a picture, save it, and return to the previous activity.p  pIm having the following problem  when the user goes back to the activity after taking the picture, the progress basically, the items selected is lost. p  pI tried to use androidlaunchModesingleInstance as well as singleTask and androidalwaysRetainTaskStatetrue on my activity to save its current state and it works great when the user leave the application to do something else, then come back later to it. I tried to lunch the ACTIONIMAGECAPTURE intent with the FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK to simulate the same behavior somewhere in my mind i thought it should be the same thing as lunching the picture activity from the homescreen, but with no effect. I even tried to lunch the picture activity with startActivityforResult with the hope that somehow my activity wouldnt be lost, but with still no effect.p  pI know I could use the Bundle savedInstanceState to manually save and restore the state by overriding onPause, onResume, on Create etc, but there is actually lots of data in custom components that are not easily serializable, so Id like to avoid that. p  pWell I guess my question is how can I reproduce the same behavior as alwaysRetainTaskState manifest attribute Or is there anyway to easily save the state of my activity Or what am I doing wrong, missing the obviousp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 725 pCrossprocess memory buffers always have some overhead, and my understanding is this is quite high. But what if youre implementing a crossprocess renderbuffer, this isnt critically important in the same way as other data, so are there techniques we can use to get raw access to a chunk of memory from multiple processes, with no safety nets apart from it not crashing Or do modern operating systems simply not work with unabstracted memory in a way to make this possible... in the old days couldnt you get a pointer to ANY place in memoryp  pIm working in C but the question applies to Win XPVista7, MacOSX 10.5 amp Linux less importantly.p

Negative 725 pI have a query that selects a table of nodes, then joins a table of titles to it. This is done by first joining an inbetween table of node IDs and title IDs that allows a manytomany relationship between the first two tables. Both joins are inner so that only nodes with a properly configured and existing title are selected. I believe this to all be clean and efficient  the problem is what followsp  pThere is also a fourth table that provides a simple hierarchy for nodes nodeparents. Each row has two fields a node ID and a node ID that acts as that nodes parent nodeid and parentid. Some nodes do not have children configured in this database ie. the node itself isnt marked as a parent in any row of the nodeparents table  these are the nodes Im trying to select.p  pThe additional criteria for these childless nodes is that they have a specific title configured  hence the subquery initially selecting from nodetitles and then inner joining nodeparents. The subquery also has a GROUP BY because some nodes are parents of multiple nodes, so their nodeid will unnecessarily appear multiple times in the results. I should also point out that because of this the primary key for nodeparents is a combination of the nodeid and parentid.p  pThe queryp  precodeSELECT  nodes.nodeid,         titles.title FROM nodes INNER JOIN nodetitles ON nodes.nodeid  nodetitles.nodeid INNER JOIN titles ON nodetitles.titleid  titles.titleid WHERE nodes.nodeid NOT IN          SELECT nodetitles.nodeid     FROM nodetitles     INNER JOIN nodeparents     ON nodetitles.nodeid  nodeparents.parentid     WHERE nodetitles.titleid  1     GROUP BY nodetitles.nodeid      AND titles.titleid  1 codepre  pTables sizes nodes  32,000 nodetitles  49,000 titles  3 nodeparents  55,000p  pThe query takes around 16 minutes to complete.

Negative 725 pThis one is really getting my goat.  I need to float Container1 and Container 2 to the right and have them butt up against each other as they are now. I also need to float items inside Container2 to the right so they stack on each other.  Problem is if I set anything inside Container2 sample text 2, sample text 3 to float right it makes Container2 width 100 or something.  p  pThis could be solved by giving Container2 a specific width but that is not possible as all of this is dynamic content.  I need Container2 to grow as i stack things inside it.p  pIs there any way around this It is only a problem in ie7 all other browsers seem to be fine.

However, it takes too long to load the next page since it hasnt been preloaded.p  pMy theory is that the iPad just cant handle loading two of the same images.p  pSo I created a hash table that stored the pages that had been loaded using preloading. When trying to flip to the next page, I first checked the hash table if the page had been loaded. This solved my onload problem. However, when I did the flip the image wouldnt display before after 2 seconds even though it had been loaded.p  pIve almost tried anything and I cant think of anything else. Ive spent one week trying to fix this and I sincerely hope you guys have some input of what I can do.p  pIt works in iOS 4.3 but 3.24.2 doesnt work, which I would like to support.p
Negative 725 pIm working on parallelizing a software which simulates transport and flow process in the unsaturated soil zone. The software consists of a VB.NET user interface, and a FORTRAN DLL kernel to do the calculations. I parallelized the software by using the package MPI.NET in the VB.NET part. When the program is started with a number of processes, all of them but the master process go into a wait function, while the master process takes care of the interaction of the software with the user. When all the data required for the simulation is entered, the master process enters the FORTRAN DLL, and calls the other processes. These jump to the starting point of the function in the DLL, and together all the processes solve a linear system of equations for about 1020 times the original partial differential equation is nonlinear, therefore these iterations in order to gain accuracy in the solution. When the solution is computed, all the processes go back to VB.NET, This is done for all the timesteps of the simulation. When all steps are computed, the master process continues with the user interaction, while the other processes go back  into the wait function, until they are called again by the master process. The thing is that this program runs much slower than the original, sequential version of it. Now there might be a number of reasons for this. I used the PETSc library in the FORTRAN DLL to solve the system of equations, and I think I have configured it quite well. My question is if at some point in the architecture I described there could be a point or two which could cause a significant slowdown if not handled correctly. Im not sure f.e. if the subsequent calls of DLL function can cost a lot of time. My system is a Intel Xeon 3470 processor with 8GB RAM. The systems I tried to solve had up to 120.000 unknowns, which I know is at the very lower bound of what should be calculated in parallel, but at least with the 120.000 matrix I would have expected a better performance than I did measure.p  pThanks in advance for your thoughts, Martinp

Negative 725 pI really have almost no idea how I can even begin to do this so Ill just explain it. I have a custom view that holds another, smaller view. Those two views are entirely built in IB, the main one has several input fields and will only resize which I think Ive got pretty much down. The second one appears after the input in the main one has been set. To be clear, the first one only asks for some inputs, once is has them, the second view appears and starts using those input values. What I would like to do is to be able to put some inputs first, and have the second view appear, then put in some other inputs, and have emanotherem view that looks the same as the first one appear, but instead use the new input values. p  pWhat I want to know is if I have to make the same custom view in IB several times, or how I think it might be done to make the second view sort of a separate class, and have a new object created for each new input and, from another class, control how theyre positioned in the main view. If that is the way its done Id like some help because I really do not know how to programmatically make a new object, or do any of these things. The program would have to understand that the views are entirely separate, and for each command such as cancel to be applied to only one of the views.p  pI realize this is very broad but I dont have any experience at all with this particular problem. I basically have a custom view that takes some input, and would like for the view to repeat itself each time inputs are sent, but for each view to be independent of one another. p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 725 pI have a workbook with two sheets. The first is full of data and calculations, the second is mostly cells with references to the first sheet. The second sheet also concatenates strings, and references to cells in the sheet, to form SQL commands used elsewhere.p  pThere is also a second workbook soon to be more. It has a sheet identical to the first sheet of the other workbook, except with different data. The problem Im having is that the new workbook needs a sheet similar to the second of the original workbook sorry if this is sounding confusing. I would emlikeem to simply duplicate the sheet and its formulas, which I tried using the move or copy... option. Unfortunately, the formulas in the cells reference the first sheet from the old workbook, like this [foobar.xlsx]dataA1. Way too much data to remove them by hand. I cant just redo the formulas because I had to remove a lot of specific lines from the second sheet, so dragging the formula would not match up correctly. Im currently trying to hack this together with REPLACE but if anyone can offer help it would be greatly appreciated.p  pCLARIFICATION When I copy the sheet, a formula will appear as [foobar.xlsx]dataA1. I want it to just be dataA1.p  pThanks p

Negative 725 pI ran into a peculiar problem today when I wanted to migrate the history data for a table.p  pI have a table which stores the number of downloads of one type content say wallpapers. This is the old downloads table structure  p  precodeContentID DownloadCount     1           3     2           5     3           20     4           1     5           7 codepre  pNow, I realize that this table does not have any information about when the download was made. So, now I am creating a new table with the following structure.p  precodeContentID DownloadTime     1           0     1           0     1           0     2           0     2           0     2           0     2           0     2           0     3           0     3           0     3           0  etc codepre  pIn the new table structure, the number of times a ContentID appears will say the number of downloads. Now I want to move the existing data to this table. For that, a query is needed. The query should generate the data for the new table from the old table data. For example, if ContentID has 3 downloads, we need to insert 3 records in to the new table. Similarly, we need to insert 5 records for ContentID 2 etc. How to generate a output like this in a queryp  pI use mysql.p

Negative 725 pI know that A algorithm implementation problems are relatively common on stackoverflow Ive been through a lot of other postings. I have been trying for the past couple of days to implement a simple C A system. I am only allowing movement in four directions no diagonal checking, so this should be an especially simple task this is also why I only have a heuristic as my cost. Also, I have stepped through the code and, for all starting positions, an object is able to successfully find a valid path to the target. The issue, however, is that I am unable to step back through the parent pointers and store the path  movement sequence. I am using references, so I am not quite sure why there is an issue with the pointer assignments. I ran through what I think the code is doing on paper for a few, short example paths and I do not understand what I am doing incorrectly. Looping through the parent pointers, which should eventually get to NULL infinitely prints the posY of the target.p  pHere is my header filep  precode    to access a priority queues underlying container, you must extend functionality     template ltclass T, class S, class Cgt         Samp ContainerstdpriorityqueueltT, S, Cgtamp q              struct HackedQueue  private stdpriorityqueueltT, S, Cgt                  static Samp ContainerstdpriorityqueueltT, S, Cgtamp q                      return q.ampHackedQueuec                                       return HackedQueueContainerq          different enough from a Grid to be a new object     typedef struct Node         int cost, posX, posY         Node parent         Nodeint cost  0, int posX  0, int posY  0, Node parent  0  costcost, posXposX, posYposY, parentparent          overloading operators will make the cpp file easier to read         bool operatorconst Nodeamp rhs             return posX  rhs.posX ampamp posY  rhs.posY                  bool operatorltconst Nodeamp rhs             return posX  rhs.posX ampamp posY  rhs.posY ampamp cost lt rhs.cost               Node     typedef struct NodeCompare         compare n1 against a node n2         bool operatorconst Nodeamp n1, const Nodeamp n2             if n2 has a lower cost, it has a higher priority             return n2.cost lt n1.cost               NodeCompare     a list is essentially a linked list, a vector is a robust array if you do not need random access, lists are faster than vectors     we need random access for the priority queue, because it will constantly be resorted     bool PathSearchstdlistltNodegtamp path, const Worldamp World, const WorldObjamp obj, const Nodeamp target path is our output list     void NodeSuccessorsstdpriorityqueueltNode, stdvectorltNodegt, NodeComparegtamp open, stdlistltNodegtamp closed, Nodeamp parentNode, const Worldamp World, const Nodeamp target     int Heuristicint posX, int posY, const Nodeamp target  codepre  pAnd, heres my implementationp  precodebool PathSearchstdlistltNodegtamp path, const Worldamp World, const WorldObjamp obj, const Nodeamp target     stdpriorityqueueltNode, stdvectorltNodegt, NodeComparegt open     stdlistltNodegt closed     put our starting position into our queue of nodes to inspect     Node startHeuristicobj.GetposX, obj.GetposY, target, obj.GetposX, obj.GetposY     open.pushstart     whileopen.empty         Node bestNode  open.top has the lowest score by definition         open.pop         ifbestNode  target made it to the target             Node ptrNode  ampbestNode             whileptrNode this is where we would reconstruct the path                 stdcoutltltptrNodegtposYltltstdendl                 ptrNode  ptrNodegtparent                          return 1                  NodeSuccessorsopen, closed, bestNode, World, target look at the Nodes neighbors         closed.pushbackbestNode          return 0 no path found  check for towers and check for boundaries if they exist, skip the creation of that node pathfinding works for up, down, left, right, but not diagonal movement void NodeSuccessorsstdpriorityqueueltNode, stdvectorltNodegt, NodeComparegtamp open, stdlistltNodegtamp closed, Nodeamp parentNode, const Worldamp World, const Nodeamp target     stdvectorltNodegtamp openVec  Containeropen     int offsetX, offsetY     bool skip     forint i  0 i lt 4 i         offsetX  0 offsetY  0         skip  0         ifi  0 offsetY  30 up         else ifi  1 offsetY  30 down         else ifi  2 offsetX  30 left         else ifi  3 offsetX  30 right         add check for out of boundaries or in an occupied space         Node newNodeparentNode.cost  HeuristicparentNode.posX  offsetX, parentNode.posY  offsetY, target, parentNode.posX  offsetX, parentNode.posY  offsetY, ampparentNode         if the Node already exists on open or closed with a lower score, we can skip to the next neighbor         if the Node already exists on open or closed with a higher score, then we need to remove it         the erasing is somewhat expensive, but simplifies the implementation         forstdlistltNodegtiterator itr  closed.begin itr  closed.end itr             ifitr lt newNode                 skip  1                 break                          else ifitr  newNode                 closed.eraseitr                 break                               ifskip continue         forstdvectorltNodegtiterator itr  openVec.begin itr  openVec.end itr             ifitr lt newNode                 skip  1                 break                          else ifitr  newNode                 openVec.eraseitr                 break                               ifskip continue         open.pushnewNode       int Heuristicint posX, int posY, const Nodeamp target     return absposX  target.posX  absposY  target.posY  codepre  pBy inspection, closed and open contain the correct results.

Negative 725 pLet me first sketch the concrete situation I find myself in, although my question is actually more general. Im writing a component containing several sliders and I have listeners listening for events from these sliders. When one of these sliders changes I want my component to send an event to its own listeners to notify them that its state has changed. I would however like to limit the number of events that are sent, i.e. if there are several events waiting when my component notifies its listeners, I would like to collapse all these events into a single event.p  pMy question is whether there are standard techniques for this. If so, any example would be welcome, because I couldnt find any. Maybe collapsing is not the correct terminologyp

Negative 725 pHi to all Qt Modelview programming gurus here in Stackoverflow. The project I am working on requires me to define a QAbstractItemModelderived model for XML data. I had previously asked a question here when I ran into a problem during implementation of this model  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7253232qsortfilterproxymodelcrasheswhendeletingarowfromthesourcemodelviatheQSortFilterProxyModel crashes when deleting a row from the source model via the source model functionap  pThe model is currently  doing its job pretty well in the application except for some performance issues which I do not know how to solve. One of the functions in this  application is to add Frame element xml nodes by setting the Max Num and Rand numbers. Each Frame element will have both Num  and Rand numbers running from 0 to MaxNum  1 and 0 to MaxRand1 respectively.

However, when the element count goes beyond 500 or so, the adding of Frame elements via QAbstractItemModel functions becomes painfully and exponentially slow. The GUI freezes for a long period of time, to the point where I gave up waiting most of the time.p  pstrongMAJOR UPDATEstrongp  pI have found out what is causing the slowdown when inserting a large number of, say 1000 items into my model. I was calling both insertRowrow, parent and setData once per item inserted, which turns out to be very expensive due to the signals emitted inside these functions.p  pI have modified the code to insertRowsrow, 1000, parent instead and defined a new silentSetData that does not emit a dataChangedcurrIndex, currIndex. I have also included a new public function called notifyDataChangesstartRow, endRow, parentIndex which in turns emit the dataChanged signal once for the given range of data. All is fine but now the caller class will need to explicitly call notifyDataChanges after the whole set of data is inserted.p  pNow I am wondering why is emitting dataChanged signals so expensive Has anyone tried other means to overcome this problem when insertingchanging large number of items in the model at oncep

Negative 725 pI have an ASP.NET Webform which currently calls a Java WebService. The ASP.NET Webform is createdmaintained inhouse, whereas the Java WS is a package solution where we only have a WS interface to the application.p  pThe problem is, that the Java WS is sometimes slow to respond due to system load etc. and there is nothing I can do about this. So currently at the moment there is a long delay on the ASP.NET Webform sometimes if the JavaWS is slow to respond, sometimes causing ASP.NET to reach its timeout value and throw the connection.p  pI need to ensure data connectivity between these two applications, which I can do by increasing the timeout value, but I cannot have the ASP.NET form wait longer than a couple of seconds.p  pThis is where the idea of a queuing system comes into place.p  pMy idea is, to have the ASP.NET form build the soap request and then queue it in a local queue, where then a Daemon runs and fires off the requests at the JavaWS.p  pBefore I start building something from scratch I need a couple of pointers.p  ol liIs my solution viable li liAre there any libraries etc already out there that I can achieve this functionality with li liIs there a better way of achieving what i am looking for li ol

Tiny creates files every once in a while. I want to store them automatically on the storage server and remove the originals when its safe. I have to retain the directory structure of tiny. I dont know in advance how the dir structure looks like. That is, all files are created in the directory codesomedircode but sudirectories of this are created on the fly. They should be sotred in codeotherfoldcode on the storege server preserving the substcrutre under codesomedircode. E.gp  pcodesomedirblafoobarsnap001acode on tiny  becomes codeotherfoldblafoobarsnap001acode on the storage server. They are all called codesnapxxxxcode wgere xxxx is a four letter alphanumeric string.p  h1My old solutionh1  pNow I was thinking to loop over files and codescpcode them.

Negative 725 pI want to create a large table about 45 billion rows that is always accessed by a unique key.p  pOutside of the DB, the best structure to hold this is a Dictionary or a HashSet, but of course due to the size of data, its not possible to do this outside of the database.p  pDoes SQL Server provide a structure thats optimized for keyvalue access I understand that a clustered key is very fast, but still its an index and therefore there will be some additional disk reads associated with traversing index pages. What I would like to get from SQL Server is a native structure that stores data as keyvalue pairs and then makes it possible to access values based on keys.p  pIn other words, my question is how to store in SQL Server 45 billion rows and efficiently access them WITHOUT having an index, clustered or nonclustered, because reading the index nonleaf pages may result in substantial IO, and since each value can be accessed by a unique key, it should be possible to have a structure where the hash of a key resolves into a physical location of the value. To get 1 value, we would need to do 1 read unless there are hash collisions. p  pan equivalent in Oracle is Hash Clusterp  pThanks for your help.p
Negative 725 pAs you can see from the title, Im busy programming a little programm for visualizing fractals in Java. Anybody who deals with fractals will come to the point where heshe searches for a solution to get these stupid bands away, when you just colour a pixel by the number of iterations it took to escape. So I searched for a more advanced colouring algorithm, finding the normalized iteration count. The formula Im using isp  precodefloat loc  float 1  Math.logMath.logc.abs  Math.log2 codepre  pEverybody on the Internet is so happy about this algorithm, everybody uses it, everbody gets great results. Except me. I thought, this algorithm should provide a float between 0 and 1. But that doesnt happen. I did some calculations and came to the conclusion, that this algorithm only works for c.abs  Math.E ampamp c.abs lt Math.exp2 that is Math.E  Math.E. In numbers this means, my input into this equation has to be between about 2.718 and 7.389.p  pBut a complex number c is considerd to tend towards infinity when its magnitude gets greater than 2. But for any Input smaller than Math.E, I get a value greater than one. And for any number greater than Math.exp2, it gets negative. That is the case if a complex number escapes really fast.p  pSo please tell me what am I doing wrong. Im desperate.p  pThanks.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI was wrong the code I posted is correct, I just 1. used it the wrong way and so it didnt provide the right output. 2. had to set the bailout value of the mandelbrotjulia algorithm to 10, otherwise I wouldve got stupid bands again.p  pProblem solvedp

Negative 725 pIm trying to write some shellcode that will eventually be in the form of an English paragraph.  This means that Im mostly limited to instructions that have opcodes that evaluate to alphanumeric characters or punctuation.  This actually leaves me with many different jump instructions including codejocode, codejnocode, codejbcode, codejaecode, codejecode, codejnecode, codejbecode, codejacode, codejscode, codejnscode, and codejpcode which correspond to letters codepzcode.  Each of these jumps performs a test before it decides to jump or not.  In most cases I can combine a jump plus its inverse to ensure a jump will take place in the shellcode e.g. using codejocode then codejnocode, or codejecode then codejnecode, but I cannot do this in the case of codejbcode.  The test for codejbcode is codeCF1code.p  pMy question is, is there any series of alphanumberic instructions that is functionally a NOP, but also ensures that codeCF1code  codeCFcode is the carry flag, so any operations that are guaranteed to set the carry flag would suffice.p  pAlso to ensure a codejaecode, is the anyway to ensure that the codeCF0codep

Negative 725 pI have quite the problem here.  I have an MVP application where I have a model that handles the implementation for talking to an external device.  In the application I create 4 instances of this class.  Each instance communicates to its external device via a UDP socket using a unique IP and port.p  pNow for all initial testing everything seemed fine as I have 4 views and each view shows a count for each device that is unique.  For testing I always only connected to a single device and the other 3 connections were doing nothing, but there views always showed a count of zero as expected.p  pThe problem came when I started programatically creating individual log4net loggers to log the count from each instance based upon a timer firing.  What I found was that each log file was logging the same count I thought it was my log4net implementation, but alas when debugging I saw for myself in the debugger each instance returning the same count.p  pWhen the instances of the models are created they are all passed to a presenter which holds a reference to each. Each model is given a unique string identifier which is how I know which instance I am viewing when debugging aside from the IP and port.p  pAlso, I should note that the counts are set on reception of a unsolicited UDP packet which never comes in on 3 of the instances.p  pMy inheretince is as follows.p  pHeadModelbr HeadModelAbstractbr SubModelbr SubModelAbstractp  pThe referenced count is in the SubModel.  It was done this way because I need a class for talking to the base level device which has a set level of limited functionality.  However more advanced devices will have that functionality plus additional functionality.  I originally wanted to pass around interfaces but found that doing that would hide properties and methods in the SubModel which I still wanted to expose so I went with the abstract implementation you see.p  pThank you to all who made it this far to try and help out.p  pSUMMARY  why are 4 unique instances of a class all returning the same value for the same nonstatic propertiesp  pUPDATE Here is the misc codep  pSystemStatus holds all the counts and state.

Negative 725 pThis question is somewhat difficult to explain, so bear with me. p  pI am pulling data from a large table for my company and am trying to create a macro to make this data easier to readunderstand. The data that is on the site changes every day based on what caused certain failures in our plant, which causes my macro to analyze data that isnt there or wrong cells due to rows getting shiftedmovedaddedremoved. Because I dont think that was really clear, here is an example p  pThe macro says to select cells J5, J13, and J25. These were, when I was creating the macro, the values I wanted to be put in a list. However, when I pulled the data and ran the macro today, these values were in different spots on my sheet the value for cell J13 is now in J12. This completely messes up all of the analysis and renders my macro  data pull useless. p  pIs there a way to have the macro select the data more intelligently Perhaps have it check for the group name, then select the value from the cell next to it I wish I could word this better... Thanks if youve gotten this far p

Negative 725 pI am really needing to understand how parentchild dialogs work.p  pMy users use a OTB Application called Teamcenter.

Negative 725 pIn my application two devices are connected via bluetooth. In the background runs an own thread for the bluetooth connection.

Negative 725 pI have a database with about five possible index columns, all of which are useful in different ways.  Lets call them System, Source, Heat, Time, and Row.  Using System and Row together will make a unique key, and if sorted by SystemRow the database will also be sorted for any combination of the five index variables in the order I listed them above.p  pMy problem is that I use all combinations of these columns sometimes I want to JOIN each SystemRow to the next SystemRow1, sometimes I want to GROUP or WHERE by SystemSourceHeat, sometimes I want to look at all entries of SystemSource WHERE Time is in a specific window, etc.p  pBasically, I want an index structure that functions similarly to every possible permutation of those five indexes in the correct order, of course, without actually making every permutation although I am willing to do so if necessary.  Im doing statistics  analytics, not traditional database work, so the size of the index and speed of creating  updating it is not a concern I only care about speeding my improvised queries as I tend to think them up, run them, wait 510 minutes, and then never use them again.  Thus my main concern is reducing the wait 510 minutes to something more like wait 12 minutes.p  pMy sorted data would look something like thisp  precodeSys So H Ti R 1   1  0 .1 1 1   1  1 .2 2 1   1  1 .3 3 1   1  2 .3 4 1   2  0 .5 5 1   2  0 .6 6 1   2  1 .8 7 1   2  2 .8 8 codepre  pEDIT It may simplify things a bit that System virtually always needs to be included as the first column to make any of the other 4 columns in sorted order.p

Negative 725 pThe architecture of the Session component in Zend Framework 2 is yet undocumented and Im having some trouble understanding its practical use compared to the very intuitive Symfony Session for example.p  pA short summary of the important piecesp  ul licodeZendSessionStorageSessionStoragecode maps and replaces the codeSESSIONcode supergloballi licodeZendSessionSessionManagercode is a facade to manage the storage, the session cookies, session configuration, session validation, etc.li licodeZendSessionContainercode is a sort of replacement for the old codeSessionNamespacecode, different Containers share one Manager instance via a static field.li ul  pThere is no component that represents a collection of namespaces containers and therefore there is no way of using methods like issetNamespaceX, unsetNamespaceX, etc. emNobodyem including the Manager as well as Storage knows about the containers, whether there are any, and if, how many with what names.p  pMatthew Weier OPhinney explained this circumstance as followsp  blockquote   pThe Container is a special class for working with isolated segments of   the current Storage instance. [...] If anything, a Storage adapter   would contain Containers, not the Manager. However, we also want to   allow more basic usage of storage, which makes the strongContainer   orthogonal to Storagestrong, and which explains the difference in hasa   relations.p blockquote  pI see a couple of practical problems with this solution with regard to proper dependency injection. Obviously the Manager can be seen as a service with a rather long lifetime and therefore qualifies for constructor injection. Unfortunately, the Manager has no clue about the Containers which forces me to either inject Containers as well bad because rather short lived and takes slots away, write my own additional functionality to make the Storage or the Manager Containeraware should be framework functionality or create Containers in my Consuming classes which I want to avoid obviously.p  pSo the Zend solution doesnt seem practical to me. If I want to use the Manager, the FlashMessenger and an additional container, I need to inject 4 four classes. If I do the same with the Symfony Session, I only need to inject 1 one class.p  pFurthermore Containers dont qualify for injection since theyre potentially short lived run time objects, which may exist or may not at a given point during script execution. With Symfony Session this is not a problem since the Session is aware of its bags containers, with ZF2 this is a problem since the Manager is NOT aware of the Containers.p  hr  pstrongMain questionstrong How am I supposed to use ZendSession with Containers in practicep  pAdditional question Is there a good reason not to provide real namespace functionality similar to emZF1em or for example similar to the emSymfonyem codeSessionBagcodep

Negative 725 pOk I found a few questions on how to get data from a MYSql database into an iOS app, but I am just asking a few best practices here. I know these can all be separate questions, but I am hoping that they can be answered in a way that they relate to each other.p  pAm I correct to understand that to be able to get data into an iOS app  I need to first generate a JSON file, have that stored on a server and than have the app download this filep  pIf the previous answer is NO then does that mean, I can pull in data on the flyp  pLastly I have seen PHP examples to create JSON files, but iOS is in Objectivec. Does this mean I need to load a UIWebView to be able to load the PHP page that generates the filep  pWhat I havep  pI have a MYSql database  it is set up through PHPMyAdmin, so I am not familiar enough with the creation process of the database yet. I will look into that.p  pI can also export the JSON file from PHPMyAdmin, but that is no good to me in a iOS app.p  pI also have the parsing from a JSON file into an iOS app sorted, but I want to be able to do this on the fly instead of creating potentially hunderds of files.p  pI hope someone can help me herep  pI am not necessarily asking for code, but would be mad to ignore itp
Negative 725 pI have a worksheet that has become very complex. On it, there is a sheet in which a user will paste data about once every other day. The data will always be in the same format, and is provided to us in an exact way only. Once pasted in, I need a way for a very average user of excel to be able to press a button or key combo, or whatever and excel will run a series of about 810 regex find and replaces. All of these will be on column A of the data. Once those are all run, a simple formula would be run on every cell C2 and below in column C. Those columns should be reduced by 80  C2.8p  pThis should all be done with minimal user input if possible.p  pWould anybody much more versed in regex or excel know a better direction for me to look for a proper start What resources would be recommended to best accomplish thisp

I then bind the BindingList to the datagridview as followsp  precodethis.dgListView.DataSource  pList codepreli ol  pThe datagridview has 3 columns and as many rows as the number of Members. However, the cells do not have any data. I think the reason is because the 3 properties in Member are not available to the parent Person.

The key reason is that pList is a property in a class that I am using to access different objects of type Person. Each of these objects is associated with a different windows form. I therefore want to use pList to display the object in the relevant form, as long as the object class inherits from Person class. I also do not want to maintain 2 copies mList and pList because if I sort, add, delete or filter from one, i will be forced to sort on the other. Is there a way of making the datagridview detect the properties in codeBindingListltPersongtcode hence be able to populate it as if it was bound to codeBindingListltMembergtcodep

Negative 725 pI am now stumped on this and I need help.

If i then try and resubmit the form with same data, browser will hang for a while, and then come up with This script is taking too long to process... do you wish to...p  pSo I started butchering my pages to try and see what is causing this slowdown. Seems like IE chokes on the table second time round and displays the erro message, but whyp  pI followed MSNs advice on optimising tables for IE rendering, and I have added fixed width for this table as well as subtables, i have also added codeltcolgroupsgtcode. This has minimal impact.p  pSoon after I realised that if I remove the call for JQuery UI in my scripts, the error would go away, and IE8 under virtualbox would render each ajax response without issuesp  pSo, can someone offer some advice as to WHY oh WHY including JQueryUI causes an ajax table to load incredibly slow and fudge up the browser.p  pBTW  only reason why jqueryUI is there is becuase I am using the JQueryUI datepicker in my search form.

Negative 725 pHow is it possible to show the errors from the model validations if the user for instance types in an already used username or email.

Negative 725 pI have a class D that extends B which extends A. I now want to add a class C that has exactly the same interface as B but provides a different implementation. So I design it as the following img srchttpupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommons88eDiamondinheritance.svg altdiamondp  pThis is not exactly what I want, as I only need an instance of D to either extend B or C and not both, however, this is only determined at runtime. The problem with the design above is of course that if I call a method in D which is implemented both in B and C, its ambiguous.p  pSo what I would like to have is to create an instance of either B or C at runtime and then cast it into D. Every time an instance of D calls an inherited method it should use the one of its original object.p  pDo I need to fiddle with typeid and ifelse around each method call or is there a more elegant way to do thisp  precodeclass A  virtual f1 virtual f2   class B  public virtual A f1 f2 f3   class C  public virtual A f1 f2 f3   class D  public B, public C f4f1 f3   ... D d  new D E e  new Ed egtdgtf1 egtdgtf4 codepre  pInstances of D are then passed to another class E which does stuff with D and therefore, I cannot modify the interface of D.p
Negative 725 pWhile a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions448981whatcharactersarevalidincssclassnamesthis popular questiona, and its answers cover a fair bit of ground on the subject, Im curious about what constitutes a valid class name in the wild emat the time of this writingem.p  pcodelteditgtcode To expand on this, as it is the core of my concern, are we not at a point in the evolution of useragent technology and standard support, that certain naming hacks can be abandoned, instead repurposing them for robustness in common use Understandably, there will always be edgecases emsomeone is probably using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNetscape6 relnofollowNN6a, with no intention to stopem but Im an advocate of making things work as expected emread as pixelperfect as possibleem in 90 of browsers, expecting that the remainder will have an acceptable experience. codelteditgtcodep  pNamely, prefixing emor general use ofem underscores codecode and hyphens codecode.

Negative 725 pIs there a way in css to make sure that a div or class is only one line of text, and if it runs over, append ellipses on it I know that you can set the divclass to a certain height and codeoverflowhiddencode, but it looks strange for what Im trying to do.p  pIn the picture below you see that the div on the right is larger than the one on the left. If I can make the name of the song one line with ellipses, they will both be the same height. Anyone know how to accomplish this P.S. I want a better way than doing something like codesong  substr0, 10, songcode in php... something hopefully possible with CSS.p
Negative 725 pi know how to check the GNU C Library on my x86 workstation, but now i would like to know which GLIBC version is using my cross toolchain for ARM i didnt build the toolchain. I cant test the libc.so.6 file of my toolchain PATH library in my x86 workstation. Is there some way to know the glibc version without compile a test program and testing in my embedded system. Furthermore, how can i know which PATH library is using by default the GNU linker of my toolchain. Thanksp

Negative 725 pI have just run into this problemp  precodecouchy.py H myhosta version E no connection nagios  codepre  pcodecouchy.pycode is a tool of mine using codegetoptcode.p  pPlease note that there is a mistake in the calling parameters codeno connectioncode is not quoted it should be codeno connectioncode, so that the codeEcode flag sees only codenocode as paramter. And even worse, there is a nasty sideeffect the codenagioscode flag is left unprocessed. It seems that the first entry not related to an option flag in this case codeconnectioncode stops flag processing.p  pAs a result, my tool is not producing a nagios suited exit code, just a normal exit code in this case code0code, which nagios interprets as codeOK no errorcode, and I miss the alarm.p  pSince I make this error not quoting properly the parameters quite often, I would like to avoid the sideeffect is there a way to force getopt to process all flags, until the end of the command linep

One problem I can see is that GHC cant make sure that the newly created Genomes will result in the same Phenotypes as it receives, but Im not sure of how to solve that problem. There also might be some problems with the class declarations that I have overlooked so I would probably help to get someone better than me to look it over.p

That takes up a rather long time and therefore creates an overhead when running a hrefhttpvalgrind.org relnofollowValgrind codememcheckcodeaa hrefhttpwww.drmemory.org relnofollowDrMemorya. So when invoking the program several times with different arguments, it takes up a considerable amount of timep  pMy idea would be to use codeforkcode right after the data loading phase and then hand the children off to ValgrindDrMemory.

But this would mean, that the server must also has an instance of codeproxycode object to be able to send this so called real response.br And this sounds really ugly and horrible to me. Not that Ill be surprised if this is the only option, but..p  pEdit for the second option  this would mean, that the client should have a listener port, should handle incoming connections, etc. Does not sound like a client to me..p  hr  pI understand, that I may be missing some fundamental parts of how codegSoapcode works, but I read the whole a hrefhttpwww.cs.fsu.eduengelensoapdoc2.htmluser documentationa and the a hrefhttpwww.cs.fsu.eduengelensoapmain.htmlgetting started guidea and I didnt find anything about this. p  psubPlease, let me know if something is not clearsubp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong Heres the scenario, I want to achievep  ol liclient sends strongrequeststrong to the serverli liserver returns strongACKstrong as response like the standard ACK  signals successfully received requestli lilater, the server sends strongresponsestrong to the client thats the real responseli lithe client returns strongACKstrong again  signals successfully received responseli ol  pAnd this scenario could be in the opposite direction, too server could also send request to the client.

Negative 725 pI have been using WPFMediaKit to render a DirectShow graph. Here is my setup.p  pI am having trouble using one codeMediaPlayerBasecode multiple times with multiple D3DRender instances.

Negative 725 pI have two pages that I am dealing with. My first is a form we will call mainform.php that holds a form that users write down test results from tests they have conducted. These test results are submitted into a database upon submission of the form. Within mainform.php I have a Jira issue slider tab that users can log issues they run into while running the tests. My second page issueSubmit.php is the page that interacts with the JIRA Rest API and sends the information the JIRA. The output of the command is a bunch of info including a JIRA issue number.p  pMy question is, what would be the best way to have the JIRA issue number sent back to the first page so that it can be attached to those test results. Keep in mind that mainform.php is not being refreshed and the user is not navigating away from it until they hit the form submit button. I thought about AJAX but from what I have read I am not sure AJAX by itself is enough. Any suggestions would be great.p

If I manually check out the third party dll everything builds. p  pHow do I force TFS to check out the correct third party dll files I can think of two possible methods but dont particularly like either. 1 I could add a libs folder to Solution1 and add the dll there. Then the dll will be checked out when solution1 is checked out. I dont like this method though because there are solutions in addition to Solution1 that will use the third party assembly, and I want to maintain only a single copy of the file.p  p2 I could create a dummy ThirdParty projectsolution and add the files to that solution, then add the dummy project to solution1 solution.

I want to be able to write to the parentchild table with a stateless session, to preserve speed, but also to read from the table with a stateful session, so that the Children collection gets loaded correctly.  However, it seems that the two approaches are incompatible.  The call to codeHasManycode breaks the statless write removing it breaks the stateful read.p  pIn a wider context, there may also be instances where Ill want to write to the database using a stateful session.  But in that case the inclusion of the codeMapx gt x.ParentId.ColumnParentIdcode statement breaks the stateful write.p  pIt looks as though Ill need to use different mappings for stateful and stateless sessions.  However, Im new to NHibernate, and I cant see an obvious way to do that at this stage.  Can anyone suggest a way to do this, or an equivalent workaroundp

Negative 725 pIm experimenting with a multiple column layout. I want to create a table of contents and have stumbled across the CSS columncountproperty. This property specifies, in how many columns the content in my case in alphabetical order will be displayed in my case a div. [Could I also use a table for my problem]p  pI would like the table of contents to have multiple columns but just as much, that they do not overlap of course with a certain padding. How can I achieve hat If I hardcode a columncount e.g. 7, I cannot be sure that the content does not overlap. If I do not specify anything, the columncount property is set to auto and will display everything in only one column.p  pAnd I do not know if I can use a table, since data we are specifying the contents of a table row after row not column after column the scaling problem i.e. how many columns would still remain.p  p[edit]I am using XSLT to populate the table of contents i.e. it is not static content.[edit]p  precode   ltdiv stylemozcolumncount 50 webkitcolumncount 50 columncount 50gt     ltpgtlta hreftopic0gttopic0ltagtltpgt ltpgtlta hreftopic1gttopic1ltagtltpgt ltpgtlta

Let the messenger of user B open a client connection to the server and to permanently receive data from there does not sound good to me. When the connection is interrupted it has to be reestablished  possible until next interruption.

Negative 725 pI am working on an implementation of one of the a hrefhttpbigflake.commediacodecCameraToMpegTest.java.txt relnofollowAndroid Test Casesa regarding previewTexture recording with the new MediaCodec and MediaMuxer APIs of Android 4.3.p  pIve managed to record the preview stream with a framerate of about 30fps by setting the recordingHint to the camera paremeters.p  pHowever, I ran into a delaylag problem and dont really know how to fix that. When recording the camera preview with quite standard quality settings 1280x720, bitrate of 8.000.000 the preview and the encoded material suffers from occasional lags. To be more specific This lag occurs about every 23 seconds and takes about 300600ms.p  pBy tracing the delay I was able to figure out the delay comes from the following line of code in the drainEncoder methodp  precodemMuxer.writeSampleDatamTrackIndex, encodedData, mBufferInfo codepre  pThis line is called in a loop if the encoder has data available for muxing. Currently I dont record audio so only the h264 streams is converted to a mp4 format by the MediaMuxer.p  pI dont know if this has something to do with that delay, but it always occurs when the loop needs two iterations to dequeue all available data of the encoder to be even more specific it occurs always in the first of these two iterations. In most cases one iteration is enough to dequeue the encoder.p  pSince there is not much information online about these new APIs any help is very appreciatedp

The function takes a list of n1 pointvalue tuples x, fx and returns     the matrix A and the vector b. In case anything goes wrong, the function     returns the tuple None, None.

Negative 725 pIm taking a class in Algorithms and Data Structures Python. In the book there is an example of a stack with methods that return certain values.

Windows 4 is my satellite window, and its nice that most emacs commands that open a new buffer e.g. grep, compilation commands, etc show that new buffer always in Window 4.  That makes life very easy because I bound F12 to jump directly between Window 3 and Window 4 and back.p  pThe bad bloke is psvn.el.  The emsvnstatusem buffer is always opened in Window 3, as desired.br But all other buffers svndiff, svnlog, ... open randomly in Window 1, 2 or 3, and I can never predict in which one theyll open.

Negative 725 pI am new to Objective C so this code is probably not written that well. p  pWhen the app is launched, it calls the following code if it has not been saved into the phone yet. When it starts to loop through the while loop, the app crashes on any phone the is not the iphone 5s. I think this is due to the memory usage.

I should also add that the amount of times the loop is iterated is about 6000. p  pBasically html code is generated from a URL and this processes it to find movies and shows based on how the html on the website is written.

Negative 725 pUpon attempting to populate a grid on the UI layer, the UI asks the BI layer for a list of results, EF returns the list of each result, and they are cast into a DTO that pulls in some additional information, this is converted to a list and returned to the UI layer.p  pThe performance is impossibly slow. EF is creating a new context and hitting the DB for each individual result. This is because the DTO class will create a new dbcontext each time it is initialized if it is no longer openactive. Finalization of the class closes out the context. I believe this is what is killing performance.p  pIs there any way to batch something like this In SQL i would performance a JOIN on the tables i need to get the resulting data loaded into a dataset. In EF when i create the DTO i then access the mapped objects relations and access data from other objects as such.p  pHow should I access a large amount of records via EF to be returned to a UI layer grid when i need to access some information that is not stored in that particular entity object an example of this would be having a relation between users  customers via the customeruserID  userID PK. And wanting to display the Users Name, once i have the Customer object i need to then query the User object for the Users name in relation to that ID.p  pAnyone have any articles that can point me the correct wayp

Negative 725 pIm working on Android OpenGL ES 1.1 game, and looking for help in fixing bugs that makes apps randomly quite often crash.  App has its origins in iOS, so it used glMapBufferOES to fill vertex array and then draw. As it is only OpenGL extension I decided to remove it and continously upload data using glBufferData. p  pBefore calling that method i setup vertex buffer with glGenBuffer and glBindBuffer. There we find a first problem. Before uploading vertices i always clear vbo and generate new with glGenBuffers 1, ampvertexVBO , but after checking its size vertexVBO it keeps incrementing  1, 2, 3, 4 etc after every upload. After some time vertex buffer has size 150 instead of 1. p  pIt seems like it causes heap memory corruption. How can I prevent this overflow and keep vertexVBO size always 1 Should I even use VBO if I dont want to use glMapBufferOESp

Negative 725 pRecently in C 4.0 the task based approach for async programming was unveiled. So we were trying to develop some of our functions which used callbacks earlier. p  pThe problem we are facing is with the implementation of multiple responses for the functions using tasks. E.g. we have a function which fetches some data from a thirdparty API. But before fetching the data from API we first check whether we already have it in our inmemory cache or in DB then only we go to the API. The main client application sends a request for a list of symbols for which data to fetch. If we find data for some symbols in cache or in DB we send it immediately via the callback. For remaining symbols we request the API. p  pThis gives a feeling of realtime processing on client application for some symbols. And for other symbols the user gets to know that it will take time. If I do not send responses to the client instantly and first collect all the data and then only send response for the whole list then the user will be stuck for 99 symbols even if only 1 symbol is to be fetched from API.p  pHow can I send multiple responses using the task based approachp

Negative 725 pIm working on my matplotlibwidget that Ive created with QtDesigner.p  pWhen i draw my testpoints into my plot, they are mostly arranged at the border or cross the axes.

Negative 725 pIm doing my first Django project and am wrestling with a legacy DB from a 3rd party program. The DB has a slightly unusual table structure for one section Im trying to get to grips with.p  pThe basic table layout is as followsp  precodePERSON  zpk int primary key, zname text   SPOUSEREL  zperson int foreignkeyperson.zpk zspouserel int codepre  pso for example, PERSON containsp  precode1, John Smith 2, Maggie Brown 3, Bob Johnson 4, Sarah Lee codepre  pAnd SPOUSEREL would contain the followingp  precode1, 50 2, 50 1, 55 4, 55 codepre  pThis indicates that John Smith married Maggie Brown in marriage number 50 and that John Smith also married Sarah Lee in marriage number 55. The numbers 50 and 55 are numbers that simply create a link from one person to another to indicate a marriage and have no another relevance.p  pIve tried a combination of various codeManyToManyFieldcode and codeForeignKeycode, e.g.p  precodeclass Spouserelmodels.Model     zpersons  models.ManyToManyFieldPerson, dbcolumnzpk     zspouserels  models.ManyToManyFieldself codepre  pbut without success.

Negative 725 pI have a codenumpycode matrix codeMcode and I need to apply some operations to all the rows of the matrix, except for a determined rows.p  pFor example, suppose I have rows code[3,5]code whose elements should be avoided from an operation like codeM[,8]  4code. So I want to have all the rows of the 8th column to be set to 4, but I want to avoid doing so to rows 3 and 5. How can I do this in codenumpycodep  pstrongEditstrong basically I need that to avoid a division by zero when doing a normalization by the sum of the elements of a row. Some rows are all zeros, so doing the summation which is zero then dividing by the summation will give a division by zero. What Im doing is that I find out which rows are all zeros and then I want not to do the normalization operation for those specific rows.p

Negative 725 pIn my problem i have list of lists, and i want to find list of lists being selectors selector  list containing exactly one element from each list, satisfying special condition.p  pThe code to generate all selectors would look likep  precodeselectors  [[a]] gt [[a]] selectors []  [[]] selectors yys  [ xxs  x lt y, xs lt selectors ys] codepre  pIf i wanted to add some extra condition this would be likep  precodeselectors  [[a]] gt [a] gt Bool gt [[a]] selectors []   [[]] selectors yys f  [ xxs  x lt y, xs lt selectors ys f, f xs] codepre  pHowever in my problem, i need the condition to be dependable on element being candidate for a list, and whats in list i currently build. So this would be something likep  precodeselectors  [[a]] gt  agt [a] gt Bool gt [[a]] selectors []   [[]] selectors yys f  [ xxs  x lt y, xs lt selectors ys f, f x xs] codepre  pAnd this is working very slow, because at first the recursion goes in very deeply and real work starts from there, whereas this would be MUCH faster if building list was going from left, so whenever i try to add new element to my list and i know this cannot be added so id just try to add new element.

This means that when the listening loop begins, it will crash due to the missing required resources. The problem finding the acoustic model bundle could be because the name of the bundle was not given to this method in a way it can use for instance, if you are trying to use the English acoustic model and you have added that bundle to your app project, you would invoke this method by passing code[AcousticModel pathToAcousticModelAcousticModelEnglish]code or code[AcousticModel pathToAcousticModelAcousticModelSpanish]code for the Spanish bundle, without appending .bundle to the end, and making sure that the bundle name is spelled exactly as it appears in the actual bundle name the bundle can be seen in this distributions folder Framework. p  pIf this doesnt fix the problem, it is very likely to be due to the fact that the acoustic model bundle wasnt imported successfully into the root level of your app project and its mainBundle. This usually happens either because the acoustic model bundle was never dragged into your app project when the Framework folder was originally supposed to be dragged in, or because it was dragged in but instead of using the setting Create groups for any added folders in Xcodes Add Files dialog, the option Create folder references for any added folders was unintentionally chosen. To fix this, just remove the acoustic model bundle or the Framework folder from your app and add it again to your app project with the correct setting of Create groups for any added folders in Xcodes Add Files dialog.p  pI also get these messages in my syslogp  precodeMay 27 005449 PhillipsiPhone SpringBoard[17785] ltWarninggt acousticModelPath is null May 27 005449 PhillipsiPhone SpringBoard[17785] ltWarninggt Error the default phonetic dictionary nullLanguageModelGeneratorLookupList.text cant be found in the app bundle but the app is attempting to access it, most likely there will be a crash now.

Negative 725 pIm trying to get my head around the best way to add a record to a join table through alternative controllers in rails.p  pI have various models in my app that will require this, but Im focusing on these two first before I transcribe the method into others, so shall use this as the example.  I have a codeVenuecode and codeInterestcode model which are to be connected through codeVenuesInterestscode model it has a couple of extra optional attributes so isnt a HABTM relationship.  A user can admin a Venue instance andor an Interest instance and therefore there should be an ability to select Venues to attach to an Interest and likewise Interests to attach to a Venue.  This should be done with an Add Venues link on the Interest instance view and an Add Interests link on the Venue instance view.  This would then take the user to a list of the relevant instances for them to select ones they would like to select.p  pHere are my modelsp  pVenue.rbp  precodeclass Venue lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany interests, through venueinterests     hasmany venuesinterests, dependent destroy      acceptsnestedattributesfor venuesinterests, allowdestroy gt true  end codepre  pInterest.rbp  precodeclass Interest lt ActiveRecordBase  hasmany venues, through venueinterests     hasmany venuesinterests, dependent destroy  end codepre  pVenuesInterests.rbp  precodeclass VenuesInterest lt ActiveRecordBase      belongsto interest belongsto venue validates interestid, presence true validates venueid, presence true  end codepre  pThis all seems fine, however its the controller and views that Im struggling with.  Ive tried adding an extra method codeaddinterestcode to the Venues controller to do the job of the create method in the VenuesInterests controller, so that there will be a different view when adding Venues to an Interest than there would be adding Interests to a Venue, otherwise I dont know how I would do this.  My current Venues controller is as followsp  pVenuesController.rbp  precodeclass VenuesController lt ApplicationController beforefilter authenticateknocker, only [new, edit, create, update, destroy]  respondto html, json  def index     venues  Venue.all.paginatepage params[page].ordercreatedat DESC end  def show     venue  Venue.findparams[id]     hash  Gmaps4rails.buildmarkersvenue do venue, marker         marker.lat venue.latitude         marker.lng venue.longitude         marker.infowindow venue.name     end end  def new     venue  Venue.new end  def edit     venue  Venue.findparams[id] end  def create     venue  currentknocker.venues.createvenueparams     respondto do format         if venue.save             format.html  redirectto venue, notice Venue was successfully created.              format.json  render json venue, status created, location venue          else             format.html  render action new              format.json  render json venue.errors, status unprocessableentity          end     end end  def update     venue  Venue.findparams[id]     venue.updateattributesvenueparams     respondto do format         if venue.updateattributesvenueparams             format.html  redirecttovenue, notice gt Your Venue was successfully updated.              format.json  respondwithbipvenue          else             format.html  render action gt edit              format.json  respondwithbipvenue          end     end end  def destroy end  def addinterests     venuesinterests  VenuesInterest.new     interests  Interests.all.paginatepage params[page].ordername end  private  def venueparams     params.requirevenue.permitadmin... etc end  end codepre  pThis isnt currently working as Im not sure how to reference other classes within a controller, but the important thing Id like to know is is there a better way to do this or am I kind of on the right track  If anyone has a good method perhaps a jQuery plugin for allowing multiple selection of instances for the view, that would be great too p

However It opens a new windows, Ive tried modal and nonmodal windows and while the benefit of Modal so they have to actual close the window solves the issue, id rather have it just overwrite the preexisting Form, and then on close go back to the main screen without actually using multiple windows.p  pNow I was told UserControl andor Panel would solve the issue, but it would cause a complete redesign moving from the multiple forms to the multiple panel screens and figuring out how to get those to workVisible and Invisible, im assuming it wouldnt be extremely difficult something along the lines of Panelname.show and panelname.closep  pBut would it be possible to actually add a line of code to the preexisting codeso as not to cause a complete reesign or are Panels and UserControl the only real way to implement within 1 continuous windowsp

Negative 725 pI am running tor on a small OpenWRT router, where swapping cant be avoided due to the limited amount of ram available 32mb. p  pMost of the time the router doesnt do anything else, however from time to time a postgresql database also running on the router is accessed. Due to tor constantly running, postgresql is completly swapped out and the first few accesses have very high latency  which is bad because it is a interactively used system. Ive already assigned a nice value of 15 to postgres and 15 to tor, but it doesnt seem to affect memory management very much. Setting swappiness1 globally doesnt change things too, because swapping can not be avoided  and because postgresql isnt running most of the time, it is swapped out anyway.p  pIs there any way to assign something like a memory priority to a linux process I had a look at cgroup specific swappiness, however the only description I found was that it affects the decision pagecache vs swap. What I am looking for is a parameter to tell the linux kernel to not swap out postgresql as aggresivly as the other processes but I dont want to mlock the whole process. Or would assigning swappiness80 systemwide and swapiness1 for postgresql have the effect I hope for  keeping postgresql in memory while swpping out everything else when requiredp  pThank you in advance, Clemens p

Negative 725 pBeen searching for an answer for this for a while but nothing that I can find that is useful.p  pBasically in the organisation I work in we use Shibboleth for user authentication.p  pWe probably have 200 sites amp Shibboleth works effectively for these.p  pHowever, one site in particular is protected using Shibboleth if the user is not a valid user they have to sign up for an account in this process also which is causing an issue with our Analytics Google Analytics. The referrer to the site is ALWAYS the shibboleth authenticator.p  pWhat we need is a facility to track conversions on this site based on sourcecampaign the user arrived from. The proposed solution right now is to use a Tag Manager product to fire off specific tags based on a combination the referrer or campaign. This one single site is used for a multitude of things all prospective leads to EPR but we need different information based on how the user landed on that page.p  pWe are tracking all the interaction points that lead up to this i.e. tracking potential leads but a lot drop out during the signup process and right now we do not have actual conversion data, meaning the Marketing etc is being spent based on highest traffic source rather than which source or campaign is most effective.p  pThe problem is when a user signs in, signs up using Shibboleth, Shibboleth sets a new cookie for that session. In Google Analytics all the referrer to this site are from the authenticator. p  pIs there some configuration issue with GA that I am overlooking for this scenario or is there something that can be done with Shibboleth so that the initial referrer rather than the authenticator being passed as the referrer which in turn would facilitate the rule creation of the Tag Manager to fire off the required tagsp

Negative 725 pCan someone explain what the Android tools team means in this short paragraph quoted belowp  pSpecifically What is somelib.jarp  pAre they suggesting, that I create a new sub project that has only dependencies, call it projectA then have the project publish projectA.jar using artifacts.adddefault, fileprojectA.jarp  pThe intended behavior that I want is to publish projectA.jar along with its dependencies without causing any multiple dex files define errors. p  pa hrefhttptools.android.comtechdocsnewbuildsystemtipsTOCHandlingtransitivedependenciesforlocalartifactsjarsandaar relnofollowhttptools.android.comtechdocsnewbuildsystemtipsTOCHandlingtransitivedependenciesforlocalartifactsjarsandaarap  pQuotep  blockquote   pIf you have a local jar or aar library that you want to use in more   than one project, you cannot just reference it directly as a local   dependency. This is because the android plugin will complain if it   finds the same jar file twice when dexing the project and all its   dependencies. Note that right now you cant actually use a local aar   file even if you only reference it once.p      pOne way to fix this is to deploy the artifact in a repository. While   its possible, it might not be convenient due to the overhead of   managing such a repository.p      pAnother option is to create a new Gradle subproject, and to make this   projects published artifact be the jar or aar file that you want to   reuse. Then you can simply have other Gradle subprojects depend on   this new subproject.p      pIn this new subproject, simply create a build.gradle with the   followingp      pconfigurations.createdefault p      partifacts.adddefault, filesomelib.jarp blockquote

Negative 725 pI have a question related to latency benchmark. I run Apache ZooKeeper in a cluster of 5 machines one leader and the rest are followers. There is another machine client used to sequence send requests to the protocol.p  pI manage to run a benchmark program which lasts for preselected time, aims to send requests simultaneously and continuously to each ZooKeeper server. When the preselected time elapses, I can see the latency result. p  pHowever, the above benchmark uses only one client machine to run the benchmark code. Now, I want to increase the number of client machines to make more machines send requests simultaneously. Note that I want to use same code above to test the latency.

Negative 725 pWhen I attempt to copy the value of one array at an index 1 to a new array I attempted to simply do oldArray[index]  1 but I received a cannot invoke error, I get the code EXI386INVOP when it runs twice.  Code is included below, any insight would be welcome. If youre curious as to the purpose, I am doing an exercise for a website where I need to decrypt a string.  One approach is to assume that spaces are the most common character, find the most common encrypted character, assume that it is a space, and subtract 32 from it to find the encryption key. What I am trying to do is just increment the encrypted characters until I get an intelligible message, because I want to see the difference in workload needed to write a value frequency function versus an increment.  If you have an easier way of incrementing every value in an array by 1 in Swift, please let me know, I am still very new.

Negative 725 pI have Linux Mint 17 and Python 3.4.0. I had downloaded python3.4 package for utopic so I can get Python 3.4.2. I downloaded its dependencies as well as IDLE and python3tk for 3.4.2.

Negative 725 pI need to create a simple layout with a few labels and buttons. Heres how I have positioned the UI elements in the IB. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3Sxo7.png altenter image description herep  pThis is how I want them to look like in the app as well. The label set on the left side with the same width so the elements on the right side will adjust their widths accordingly.p  pI have set the leading space to superview constraints on the labels on the left side and set vertical spacing between each of them. Similarly Ive added trailing space to superview constraint to the labels and buttons on the right side with vertical spacing between each other. Ive also added horizontal spacing between each couple of elements ex Name lt John Doe, Telephone lt button.p  pWhen I run it, it looks like this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJZjZxm.png altenter image description herep  pThe elements only take up widths as their content needs. I assume this problem occurs because there is no way to auto layout to decide on a width. If I set the labels on the left to same width constraint, it doesnt work at runtime because the constants for them are fixed so they looks like this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMPQ3Im.png altenter image description herep  pHow can I make them appear properly like I have them in the interface builderp  pThank you.p  pI uploaded a test Xcode project with this issue a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsp9jby3dmibez95qAutoLayoutInARow.zipdl0 relnofollowherea.p

My page keeps insisting on loading the new page when the link is clicked instead of making the logo bigger or compiling any other transition. I have searched but all the things on internet leads to a framework which I do not want to use. Is this possible to wo a framework or am I sentenced to using it.p  ptldr I want a transition to happen onclick and then load the new pagep  pCode is provided below although it is just a few lines.

Negative 725 pI am making a custom OPC Client application in WPF to communicate with a Kepware server. One of the functions is to configure a tag, including setting its host and server. Now I could do this manually with calls to the Kepware ClientAce API for searching for valid network hosts and valid servers on that host, but ClientAce includes a .dll that already provides a tree control the user can browse directly. However, this out of the box control is in Windows Forms.p  pSo I have this WPF Window that I launch as Modal Dialog with ShowDialog. Within this window is a WindowsFormsHost element that contains the aforementioned server browsing control. Its works pretty well for the most part, including providing an event to handle when the user has made a new selection in the tree control. That event has a boolean parameter that indicates if the new selection is a server. A good thing since thats the very thing Im trying to keep track of here.p  pIt also provides a server has been doubleclicked event, which I handle and have decided to interpret as a shortcut to the user selecting that server as the one they want. Otherwise, they have to click a separate button for the currently selected server which I stored based on the aforementioned selection event.p  pAll good so far....p  p...But There is another functionality Kepware added well actually theres a few, but Im not worried about those at this point. The user has the ability from a context menu to delete a server from the tree. For some reason, this is throwing a null exception though, it successfully deletes the server from the tree. This is a very bad thing for my purposes because...p  ol lipI dont have any idea what leads to this. There is no stack trace. There is no extra information. Just that something, somewhere in that control has thrown an unhandled exception that I must now deal with.pli lipI cant remove the context menu item. Theres another context menu item that I can set a property in the XAML to remove, but that one isnt throwing the exception. Its the one I cant remove that is.pli lipTheres a lovely event called ContextMenuItemClicked. Itd be nice if I could handle that. I just go into my handler, put a trycatch around the logic, and ignore the null exception that has absolutely nothing to do with me and what Im trying to accomplish. However, the universe is against me here, and has decided that this is a mouseclick event, which Windows Forms doesnt want to propogate. Ive searched around and this seems to be a common issue with Windows Forms and WPF interop. Mouseclicks just dont play nice with the interop services. I tried. I really did. But the handler I made just sits there unused. Odd thing is, while I can understand why I can handle the SelectionChanged event from this control, Im curious as to what Kepware did to make the ServerDoubleClick event propogate up, and why they didnt decide to extend that same courtesy to the context menu click.pli ol  pSo there I am. With an exception that isnt my fault, that I dont care about, and I apparently cant prevent. I just want to throw it away and move on. However, its in a modal dialog, and I need to have this exception handled before the method that called ShowDialog and popped this window up in the first place. Ill spare you the details as to why. This post is longwinded enough as it is.p  pIs there a way I can either somehow propogate the mouse events up, or trap this exception somewhere in my window class so that it doesnt propagate up the stack into the calling methodp

Negative 725 pI have an IntelliJ plugin that is walking PsiReference resolutions to a distant class, and having trouble because the coderesolvecode method is returning null if and only if i have not navigated to the distant file in the editor during the current IntelliJ session. I suspect that IntelliJ needs to be prodded to parse the file in some sense when you navigate to the file, you can see that IntelliJ kicks off some sort of parsing run as a lot of the code goes from being minimally highlighted to fully highlighted but I dont know how to do that. I looked in codePsiManagercode and codePsiFilecode, where I found some coderefreshcode and codereloadFromDiskcode methods, but Im guessing these have a lot of sideeffects I dont want and probably wont kick off the parsing run anyways. Detailsclarification below.p  pThe code looks something like thisp  pFile 1, in which I invoke a plugin action on codefoocodep  precodeAnnotationReferringToAnotherTypeFile2.class class File1    String foo  codepre  pFile 2, which the plugin must lookup in order to perform the action on codefoocodep  precodeclass File2    File3   void mustBeLookedUpToHandleAction   codepre  pFile 3 must also be looked upp  precodeinterface File3    public enum SomeEnum      DEFAULT,     SOMETHINGELSE       SomeEnum value default SomeEnum.DEFAULT  codepre  pI perform the action on codefoocode, and then the logic finds the codeAnnotationReferringToAnotherTypecode at the top of the containing file File 1 and coderesolvecodes to the definition of codeFile2code. Then it looks for a method in codeFile2code that is annotated with codeFile3code. Since the codeFile3code annotation on codemustBeLookedUpToHandleActioncode does not specify its value, the plugin must now look up the definition of codeFile3code in order to determine what the default value is. All of this works completely smoothly after freshly loading IntelliJ. The part that fails is the coderesolvecode from the codePsiReferenceExpressioncode codeSomeEnum.DEFAULTcode to the actual definition of codeDEFAULTcode in codeSomeEnumcode. It consistently returns codenullcode, until i navigate, in the editor, to File 3, and after that it works every time for the remainder of the session. It seems clear that the references resolutions are being parsed lazily, and if i can just find some way to kick off that parsing everything should be OKp  pYou may be thinking why the hell is this logic so complicated. Most of the logic is actually in a library im using  its internal, so i may be able to get some changes made but I doubt ill be able to make fundamental changes on account of this issue unless this issue turns out to be completely unmanageable.p

Ive tried changing the order of the scripts and the values are still different from each other.  Ive tried changing the dollar signs  to jQuery. The most frustrating thing is that Im including this partial in a different view and its working correctly the height auto values are equal to each other as they should be.

Im just totally amazed that Eclipse, which is built to develope, only access to the Runtime Environment.p  pMaybe Im wrong and at the configuration installed JREs it only gets access to things like the JVM etc. and gets access to JDK at another pointp  pI stumbled upon this while Im trying to fix a problem with parameter names from standard class methods got arg0, arg1 etc. and saw that the javadoc was not attached.p  pNow I want to know if I should select JRE or JDK at Windows  Preferences  Java  Installed JREs I dare guess that running a programm with JDK configured would slow it because the folder of JDK includes more data and therefore has a bigger size.

I dont want a scenario where multiple timers start running in the same Formpage.p  p4 Wherever I have read about the Timer Best Practice usage , they have all advocated using an Infinite Timeout in the beginning and later updating it to a user desired value. What is the specific advantage of this  Also , once I am done loading the data , I dont have a fixed place from where I can set the timeout. What should I do in such a case p

Negative 725 pIm attempting to add a footer view to my UITableView via the Storyboard, but Autolayout keeps drawing the footer view much larger than Ive sized the view in the Storyboard. This seems to be caused by the Autolayout constraints on the UIButton contained within the footer view, though no combination of constraints and Ive tried several results in the footer view sizing correctly, even when I get the UIButton sized correctly within the footer view.p  pA screenshot of the issue the footer view has a white background  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7kcT1.png altimgur linkp  pThe constraints that I used in this particular instance though keep in mind, I have tried several, including those with a defined height for the UIButton  when I set the UIButtons height the UIButton draws correctly, but the footer view is still enormous for some reason p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI8Hjz.png altconstraintsp  pThoughts Solutions I have used footer views with Storyboards before using Storyboards without any issues, though never with size classes.p

Negative 725 pI am studying for the Spring Core certification and I have some doubt about how strongJMSstrong works and about how Spring handle it.p  pSo I know that the strongJMS Core Componentsstrong arep  ol liMessageli liDestinationli liConnectionli liSessionli liMessageProducerli liMessageConsumerli ol  pFrom what I have understand a strongMessagestrong is what is send and shared with other entities other products that have to consume this data and a message can have differents shapes strongTextMessagestrong, strongObjectMessagestrong, strongMapMessagestrong, strongBytesMessagestrong and strongStreamMessagestrong.p  pOk, from what I understand the strongDestinationstrong component of the JMS Core Components defines who receives messages and the logic for dispatching messages.p  pSo I know that I have 2 kinds of destinations that arep  ol lipstrongQueuestrong that define a strongpoint to pointstrong message. From what I have understand I can have some strongMessage Producerstrong that put the generated messages into a queue and then I have some strongMessageConsumerstrong that consume message. Each message can be consumed by a single strongMessageConsumerstrong.p  pNow my doubt is a strongMessageConsumerstrong consume message putted into the queue by a specific strongMessageProducerstrong there is something like a 1 to 1 relationship between strongMessageConsumerstrong and strongMessageProducerstrong or a strongMessageProducerstrong put an id related to the specific strongMessageConsumerstrong that have to read the message that it put into the queuepli ol  pSo for example, in the first case if I have 2 strongMessageProducerstrong respectivelly named strongProducer1strong and strongProducer2strong I need to have 2 strongMessageConsumerstrong named strongConsumer1strong and strongConsumer2strong where strongConsumer1strong consume messages produced from strongProducer1strong and strongConsumer2strong consume messages produced from Producer2.p  pInstead in the second case the strongConsumer1strong can consum messages produced by from both strongProducer1strong and strongProduer2strong because the strongMessageProducerstrong put a message in the queue specifying who is the strongMessageConsumerstrong that have to consume the message.p  pHow exactly works What is the correct logicp

Negative 725 pWe would like to send 140 raw binary bytes 8bit between our cloud server and our hardware device and viceversa via a SMS payload. We do not intend to send traditional text normal SMS as the data will not need to be humanreadable. As the bytes are raw, there would be no encoding i.e. would not be GSM 7bit. Is that possible If so, what will be delivered to the client at the other endp  pIn particular, does Twilio or carriers Verizon, ATampT, etc. support this in their APIs It doesnt seem like it so we are worried that if we just send raw bytes as the message body the SMS transport layer will change it to standard GSM 7bit, which we do not want.p

Negative 725 pCurrently I am evaluating HDIV. Its a great tool to implement various levels of security. But currently I need to check its performance. ie after implementation of HDIV, what is the load time of my subsequent pages with HDIVSTATE appended to the request. p  pBut as this value is dynamically generated and is sessionusertoken specific, I am not able to configure the flow of events in JMeter. ie how do i get the generated value of HDIVSTATE which is dynamically generated and appended to my next link. Help on this will be highly appreciated. p  pYou can also let me know in case if some other tool i can use to get this done. In short I need time ie if 100 users right now are accessing my website, what would the load times of the page with HDIV and without HDIV.p

Negative 725 pstrongDescription of the Problemstrongp  pAs NPAPI plugins will be deprecated in Chrome maybe in Firefox too soon and being part of a project a hrefhttpwww.webchimera.org relnofollowWebChimeraa that is based on an NPAPI plugin. Ive been thinking of different solutions to keep NPAPI support in browsers. as porting this plugin to NaCL is currently impossible, but the plugin can be used in a frozen version of nodewebkit that currently supports NPAPIsp  pSo I was wondering if it is possible for a browser page to open a nodewebkit app on the users PC, then using JS withwithout jQuery to send data about the html element where the NodeWebkit window with always on top set should be to the app maybe through a websocket to always position it there.p  pI know I can get a html elements size, position in JavaScript, I also know I can track the scroll of the user and browser tab changes to do the necessary changes to the window size, position and visibility.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pThe thing that truly stops me from even attempting this is how would I know when a browser is not fullscreen, and how would I know the browsers position on the screen if it is not fullscreen either from the on page JS or from nodewebkit directly. Another thing that should be a concern is what screen is the browser window on.p  pAm I the only one that has thought of such an endeavor with nodewebkit, are there any open source projects attempting thisp  pAny thoughts or comments on this would be greatly appreciated as a solution to this would not only save NPAPI plugins in the near future but will also open a world where NodeWebkit can also be used as a viable solution to build browser plugins too. p

Negative 725 pI often have to import messy data from Excel or csv files into Microsoft SQL Server the import tools rarely, if ever, guess the correct data types. Even when the data doesnt need to be cleansed, there are often too many NULLs in the first rows for the data type to be identified. Since I often receive periodic updates of the source files, it would be useful to have a way to define column mapping once and for all, and then be able to use this mapping on all subsequent files.p  pE.g. I receive the file salesNewYorkJanuary. I manually identify the data type of each column can I save the columndata type association somewhere a script, a separate file so that, when I have to import another file with the same structure salesLosAngelesFebruary, I dont have to assign data types manually all over againp  pI am running Microsoft SQL Server 2014 and also have access to SQL Server Integration Services and to Pentaho. My preference would be for some kind of scriptbased solution, rather than having to go through hundreds of clicks in SSIS.p  pThanksp

Negative 725 pIm using Yii2s ActiveRecord implementation in hopefully exactly the way it should be used, according to the docs. p  h2Problemh2  pIn a quite simple setup with simple relations betweens the tables, fetching 10 results is fast, 100 is slow. 1000 is impossible. The database is extremely small and indexed perfectly.

In plain SQL everybody would solve this with one SQL statement and two joins. Yii2 however fires a SELECT for every relation in every row which makes sense to keep the ORM clean. Resulting in more or less 1  50  30  1500 queries for just getting two relations of each row.p  h2Questionh2  pWhy is Yii2 using so many single SELECTs, or is this a mistake on my side  Addionally, does anybody know how to fix this p  pemAs this is a very important issue for me Ill provide 500 bounty on May 14th.emp

Negative 725 pFrom all the resources I could pull together, I still cannot grasp thread interrupts.. From Oracles own tutorials a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialconcurrencyinterrupt.html relnofollowhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialconcurrencyinterrupt.htmla, they dont explain what causes the interrupt exception to be thrown, or how, or what it even is.. they just say it can happen whenever you invoke certain methods like Thread.sleep. Does it randomly happen when its called Is there a length of time that it takes for the exception to be thrown Is it thrown every time its called None of that makes sense because if its random, itd be useless to a programmer, and if it happens every time a certain method is called, itd have no real use.. they explain very little about it, and just move on to other thread concepts.. I havent had any issues with learning C, Lua, or Python, because the tutorials and documentation provided by them actually explains everything, this is the first time Ive ever been completely stumped by a tutorial. Ive been searching for about 2 hours for an answer. p  pCan you include what InterruptedException is exactly, and WHY its thrown p

Negative 725 pRecently I experienced some serious performance issues within my php application which tries to do some stuff with more than a ten thousand lines of CSVdata. Basically I have around ten functions which consists of different pregmatch  pregreplace actions which process one column of each line of the parsed csvdata NLP DateParser, various string modifying things, image recognition from html source, etc.p  pBecause I am reaching spheres where processing of the script is really slow between 50 and 120 seconds also as memory issues too complex objects its now time for some performance improvements p  pSo I came over pthreads which allows multi threading within a php script. But I am not really sure if this helps in my situation or just producing more performance issues than it solves through overhead of thread handlingp  pMy idea is to loop through all ten thousand lines and start a thread for each column processing step 10k lines  10 columns  10k  10  100.000 threads. Do you think that this will lead to performance improvements Or should I rather split the csvdata in to chunks lets say 200 rows which will be processed in separate threads 10k lines  200 chunks  50 threadsp  pI would have attached an image consisting my profiled php script where you can see which functions are consuming much time but I sadly have not enough reputation points p  pIs there any potential in parallel processing Can I add Attributes to the same object directly from different threads or do I have to synchronize first therefore wait for the threads to complete Is it possible to read the same file in multiple threads first hunderd rows thread 1, second hundred in thread 2, etc. and building one big object containing all rows at the end of all processing stepsp  pI hope my bad English does not prevent you from understanding my thoughts and questions...p  pThanks in advicep  pmfuesslinp  pstrongEDITstrong I am not sure about the bottlenecks Guessing the biggest one is the handling of the big object resulting from processing all the csv data... Profiler got my attention to some redundant foreach loops which I was able to ommit. But the main problem is the amount of data I have to process. All processing functions need not that much time but if you process 10k in a row....p  pThe idea of operating with inmemory db instead of csv is nice  will try that out.p  pThe preg functions cannot be replaced by str functions because I need pattern recognition.p  pI will also try Gearman and try to separate each data processing step in individual jobs.p  pPHP Version is 5.6.10 with opcache enabled.p

Negative 725 pI have a C application that is designed solely for 64bit systems. Currently I am working on the Windows implementation of the packfile system. The packfiles themselves incorporate a few thousand individually compressed files into them. The access pattern is expected to be multiple threads accessing different files at different times, but those individual files are almost always accessed sequentially. The files are expected to remain memory mapped for the duration of the program, accessed sporadically but often in short bursts where many files are accessed at once.p  pWhat is the best way to maximize the ability of Windows to perform readahead optimizations in this casep  pMy concern with a single file mapping is that the access is then not really sequential, but is basically entirely random with local sequentiality. I see two options, but I dont know which is better, or if another option is preferredp  ol liCreate a new file handle to the packfile for each subfile I wish to memory map, then CreateFileMapping and MapViewOfFile for each.li liCreate a single file handle to the packfile, and then create a unique file mapping for each subfile.li ol  pMy gut feeling is that 1 will let Windows do the best job, but I worry about having tons of file handles allocated.

Negative 725 pI am trying to add a new WatckKit target to an old project. Yet when I do it and immediately trigger the Assistant Editor, and click the initial controller, no file is loaded and message No Assistant Result is shown. Of course if I manually select the file, then connecting the outlet produces errors. I tried deleting and reinserting the target several times, as well clear the derived folder, restart Xcode and also the Mac, but the situation remains the same. When I did the same thing on new project following some tutorials, I never had this problems. What might it be and how to fix itp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comF1QyS.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF1QyS.png altScreenshotap

Negative 725 pIm trying to make an application restartcrashendtask persistant Queue or List... Ie I need to add things to it when the application runs and remove things at later times. Between these two occations the application can have restarted multiple times or crashed, or been endtasked for all I know.p  pMy first thought was to just simply create a codemylist.txtcode file to store the data line by line and add lines to the end when I need too and take and remove the first line when Im done with it.p  pProblem is that there can be many thousands of lines in the text file after a while and there is no way to just remove the first line in it without reading and rewriting the entire file.p  pSo are there any good ways of accomplishing this, given that continously reading and writing the entire file is not an optionp  pstrongEdit 1strong I am looking at SQLite, but I would prefer to not add any more dependencies or .dlls that cant be ILMerged if possible.p  pstrongEdit 2strong The application cant depend on any external servers to keep track of things for it.p  pstrongEdit 3strong A suggestion of an ILMerge compatible local database would also be an acceptable solution.p

Negative 725 pHere is what I have so far. Its rudimentary and probably a backwards way to do this.  p  pThe basic objective is to see which dates are most popular for customers using the service, which lasts as long as they buy it for serviceduration. Keep in mind I am referring to the dates that the service is bought emforem  the first day of which is the column codeservicedatecode  rather than the date the service was purchased.  p  pThis codedcode is my variable date, and I check how many transactions include that date in the range of their service duration. Right now, this outputs a bunch of different select tables. Id really like it to just add a row to the output of the previous iteration in the While loop to make one table with 2 columns and a row per date.p  pSee belowp  precodeDeclare d date  20151101  While d lt 2016331 Begin    Select        date  d,        SUMqty  CASE WHEN d between servicedate and   dateaddday, serviceduration, servicedate THEN 1 END    From RI    Where confdate gt 20150831      Set d  dateaddday, 1, d End codepre  pEDIT I think this did it p  precodeCreate Table TblDDt date, Num int Declare d date  20151101 While d lt 2016331 Begin    Insert into TblDDt,Num    Valuesd, Select SUM qty  CASE WHEN d between servicedate and dateaddday,serviceduration,servicedate THEN 1 END from RI where confdategt20150831 Set ddateaddday,1,d End Select  from TblD codepre
