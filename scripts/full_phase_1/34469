Positive 34469 pMy program has a very specific error that took me a while to track down  now I dont know how to fix it. My code is very long and in many files and I dont see much point in posting it here.p  pIn the IDE, everything runs fine, in both Debug and Release with the runtime library set to either MTd or MT, respectively, so Im assuming all dependencies are included.p  pHowever, when I run the standalone, I get a crash. At first I thought it was a dependency problem but it doesnt seem so.p  pAt some point in the code, I am accessing a vector via a method call codetgtGetListcode, where GetList is defined as codestdvectorltTgt amp GetListcode and the method simply returns a member variable simply defined as codestdvectorltTgt fieldcode in the class.p  pIt turns out, if I print out the size of the list while running from the IDE, I get 0 which is the correct answer in this case.p  pHowever, when doing the same thing running from standalone, I get the size as 467467353.p  pI tried changing the method declaration to codestdvectorltTgt  GetListcode and doing codereturn ampfieldcode and updating the rest of the code but this didnt fix anything.p  pI then tried replacing the member variable codefieldcode with a pointer, and in the constructor instantiating a new vector and deleting it in the destructor. Still no luck.p  pSo I made a simple test case program that simply made a class with a vector field, and a method to return a reference to it. Then in codemaincode I would create an instance variable and getting the vector and printing the size. This worked both in VC and as a standalone  both returned zero.p  pThis is driving me nuts and I cant figure out why Im getting different behaviour. Why is the standalone running differently, and what should I be looking at to fix thisp  pThanksp

Positive 34469 pFor some reason, visual studio 2015 is VERY buggy when it comes to coloring. I did not have any of these issues with 2013. For example, if I typep  precodeint array  new int[100] codepre  pThen the new i will be black while nt is in blue. I would expect all of it to be blue or whatever colors you choose.

Positive 34469 pI have run into a problem using stdsharedptr with a dynamically loaded library. I have only tested this on Visual Studio 2015 but the same problem may exist on other platformscompilers. This is a distilled example from a much larger program and is not meant to illustrate good C but rather a minimal case to reproduce the issue.p  pIf you have the following code that builds into a library, a DLL on Windowsp  precodestatic int localallocatememory    return new int 10     extern C declspecdllexport void getallocationfunction       return localallocatememory   codepre  pThen there is a test program, which does not link to the above library at build timep  precodeinclude ltWindows.hgt  void main        int allocatedMemory  nullptr                The string here is wherever the result of the DLL library build went         HMODULE hModule  LoadLibraryEx L..DebugDynamicLibrary.dll, nullptr, 0            getallocationfunction must have C external linkage.         auto function   GetProcAddress hModule, getallocationfunction            Get a pointer to a C function that will allocate some memory         auto allocationfunction  function           auto allocater  reinterpretcastltint gt allocationfunction           allocatedMemory  allocater           BOOL result  FreeLibrary hModule            delete allocatedMemory  codepre  pEverything works fine in the above program. This is to illustrate this is not a problem with the CRT or other cross DLL memory allocation issues.p  pNow if you change the localallocatememory to be p  precodestatic stdsharedptrltintgt localallocatememory        return stdmakesharedltintgt 10    codepre  pand make the change to match this in the main programp  precodeinclude ltWindows.hgt  include ltmemorygt  void main        stdsharedptrltintgt allocatedMemory               HMODULE hModule  LoadLibraryEx L..DebugDynamicLibrary.dll, nullptr, 0            getallocationfunction must have C external linkage.         auto function   GetProcAddress hModule, getallocationfunction            Get a pointer to a C function that will allocate some memory         auto allocationfunction  function           auto allocater  reinterpretcastltstdsharedptrltintgt gt allocationfunction           allocatedMemory  allocater           BOOL result  FreeLibrary hModule            allocatedMemory.reset     Fails here  codepre  pThe program will fail with on the stdsharedptr reset with a memory access violation. This had me baffled for quite a while. I believe the problem lies in the virtual type erasure used in stdsharedptr.p  pVisual Studio 2015 uses a type called Refcountbase as the control block os a stdsharedptr. When you do something like stdmakeshared 10  a templated subclass of Refcountbase is created called Refcountobj. Refcountobj implements various virtual base class methods called things like Destroy. Being a templated class this leads to template instantion. The vtable of the instantion points to where the compiler puts the instation of these  methods. In the case of the dynamically loaded DLL above these instations live in the DLL. p  pThe upshot of all this is that when you pass a stdshared pointer around it has pointer to functions in it that may live almost anywhere depending on how your compilerlinker handle template instantiations. So in the above example when the  dynamicall loaded library is unloaded so are the instations of these functions which leads to dangling function pointers  in your vtable which leads to a memory access violation when you try to run them as part of the reset  call.p  pSo after all that what is my question. Well first I couldnt find any confirmation of this issue or any discussion of it,  is there any Second does anyone have any good suggestions for a work around. I have done some stuff with custom allocaters but Im wondering if there is a simple solution. Note not unloading the shared library is not an option in my real world  program.p  pNot this is actually a more general problem. Implicitly exporting template instantiations via vtables across DLL boundaries. This could for instance have a potential impact on programs using a dependency injection mode using dynamically loaded libraries. p

Positive 34469 pSince Visual Studio 2010 the option to specify C project dependencies in the solution is deprecated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7683869whatdoesthelinklibrarydependencylinkeroptionactuallydoinvisualstudWhat does the Link Library Dependency linker option actually do in Visual Studio 2010a.p  pHowever hardlinking a library dependency in the project file is not always convenient. I would like to keep the dependency interchangeable.p  pFor example I have a project defining unittests for a set of libraries. I want to execute the unittests for different versions of the library each defined in its own vcxproj. PreVS2010 one solution file could be created for each library dependency, requiring only a single project file for the unittests. Now the preferred way to do it would be to duplicate the unittest project files for each library dependency, which is undesired.p  pThe .lib output of the dependency could be manually added to the Additional Dependencies in the linker options, but this feels like a hack.p  pWhat is the best practice for modeling these kind of dependencies in Visual Studio 2015p

Positive 34469 pThe C99 language features the ability to directly specify the exponent and mantissa of a binary floating point literal hence referred to as hexfloats, e.g. code0x1.0p0code is code1  pow2, 0code, or 1.0. The C11 standard includes the C99 standard library, including the ability to serialize and deserialize hexfloats from strings, but for some mysterious reason does not include the literals themselves.p  p1 Why did the language committee not add this very simple feature that is pretty much essential for numeric computingp  p2 How can I implement compiletime hexfloat parsing in the C11 subset supported by Visual Studio 2013 GCC allows hexfloat literals in C, so this is not a problem in the GNU world.p  pEDIT Apparently hexfloats couldnt be added to C11 because it would conflict with the userdefined literal p.

Negative 34469 pWe are getting very slow compile times, which can take upwards of 20 minutes on dual core   2GHz, 2G Ram machines.p  pA lot of this is due to the size of our solution which has grown to 70 projects, as well as VSS which is a bottle neck in itself when you have a lot of files. swapping out VSS is not an option unfortunately, so I dont want this to descend into a VSS bashp  pWe are looking at merging projects.  We are also looking at having multiple solutions to achieve greater separation of concerns and quicker compile times for each element of the application. This I can see will become a DLL hell as we try to keep things in synch.p  pI am interested to know how other teams have dealt with this scaling issue, what do you do when your code base reaches a critical mass that you are wasting half the day watching the status bar deliver compile messages.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I neglected to mention this is a C solution. Thanks for all the C suggestions, but its been a few years since Ive had to worry about headers.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pNice suggestions that have helped so far not saying there arent other nice suggestions below, just what has helpedp  ul liNew 3GHz laptop  the power of lost utilization works wonders when whinging to management liDisable Anti Virus during compile liDisconnecting from VSS actually the network during compile  I may get us to remove VSVSS integration altogether and stick to using the VSS UI ul  pStill not ripsnorting through a compile, but every bit helps.p  pOrion did mention in a comment that generics may have a play also. From my tests there does appear to be a minimal performance hit, but not high enough to sure  compile times can be inconsistent due to disc activity. Due to time limitations, my tests didnt include as many Generics, or as much code, as would appear in live system, so that may accumulate. I wouldnt avoid using generics where they are supposed to be used, just for compile time performancep  pstrongWORKAROUNDstrongp  pWe are testing the practice of building new areas of the application in new solutions, importing in the latest dlls as required, them integrating them into the larger solution when we are happy with them.p  pWe may also do them same to existing code by creating temporary solutions that just encapsulate the areas we need to work on, and throwing them away after reintegrating the code.

This will make it possible to use the generic module with any kind of enum defined for each project.p  pThe module hooks into the Authenticate event of the FormsAuthenticationModule, and is called on each request to the website. The module exposes public events which could be defined in the global.asax.p  pBut i cant seem to figure out how to make the generic http module work like a non generic module.p  pThere is 3 main problems.p  ol lipI cant register the generic http module in the web.config like any other module as i cant specify the generic parameter, or is possible somehow br  The way to solve that as far as i can figure out is to create a nongeneric http module that intializes the generic HttpModule the generic parameter is defined in a custom section for the module in the web.config.br  But that introduces the next problem.pli lipI cant find out how to make the public events exposed by the generic module available to hook into through the global.asax as you would normally do with a nongeneric module by just making a public method with the name like ModuleClassNamePublicEventName.br  The init method on the http module gets an reference to the HttpApplication object created in the global.asax. I dont know if it somehow could be possible with reflection to search for the methods and if they are defined in the global.asax HttpApplication super class hook them up with the correct event handler  or if any methods on the HttpApplication object can be usedpli lipHow would i store and later get a reference to the generic module created in the nongeneric module br  I can get the nongeneric module with HttpContext.Current.ApplicationInstance.Modules.GetTheModule but is there any way i can store a reference to the generic module in the nongeneric module cant figure out how it should be possible, or store it somewhere else so i can always get it If I can get a reference to the generic module from the global.asax etc. the events mentioned in nr. 2 can be manually wired to the methods.pli ol  phr p  h2Thoughts and other possible solutionsh2  pInstead of registering the module in the web.config it can be manually initialized by overridding the Init method of the HttpApplication and calling the Init method on the module.p  pBut that will introduce some new problems.p  pThe module will no longer be added to the the ModulesCollection. So I will need to store a reference somewhere else. This could be done with a property in the global.asax, and by implementing an interface, or by creating an generic abstract base type inheriting from HttpApplication, that the global.asax could inherit from. In the generic abstract base type i could also override the init method.p  pIt will still not automatically hook up methods in the global.asax with events in the generic module. If it is possible with reflection to search for defined methods in the super type of the HttpApplication it could be automatically done that way.p  pBut i can wire the methods in the global.asax with the events in the generic module manually either in the Init method or anywhere else by getting reference to the generic module.p  pIt doesnst really need to implement the IHttpModule interface if i choose to manually initalize the generic module. I could just aswell move all the code to the abstract base type inheriting from the HttpApplication.p  pI would prefer to register the module simply by defining it in the web.config as it will be the easiest and most natural  logical solution. Also it would be great if it could be kept as a HttpModule instead of having to define a an abstract base type inheriting from HttpApplication, else it will be more thighed up and not as loose and plugable as i wanted it to be but maybe it is not possible.p  pAnother alternative would be to make it all static.br  As far as i can figure out i would have to somehow make sure that only one method can be added to the public static events, so it wont add a reference each time a new instance of the global.asax is created.p  pI simply cant find out what is the best solution. I have been messing around with this and thinking about it for days now.p  pMaybe there is an option that i havent thought of p  pHope anyone out there can help me.p

Negative 34469 pI recently needed to configure a hrefhttpcode.google.compcocoahttpserver relnofollowCocoaHttpServera, which were using in our application with success, to handle HTTPS connections coming from a client application running on Android devices.

Negative 34469 pIn my model, I have a departuredate and a returndate.p  pI am using a textfield instead of the dateselect so that I can use the JQuery datepicker.p  pMy app is based in the US for now but I do hope to get international members.p  pSo basically this is what is happening.  The user US types in a date such as 04012010  April 1st.p  pOf course, MySQL stores it as a datetime such as 20100401...p  pAnyway, when the user goes to edit the date later on, it shows 01042010 because I am using a strftimemdY which doesnt make sense....so it thinks it is January 4th instead of the original April 1st.p  pIts like the only way to accurately store the data is for the user to type in 20100401p  pI hope all of this makes sense.  What I am really after is a way for the user to type in or use the datepicker a date in their native format.p  pSo someone in Europe could type in 01042010 for April 1st but someone in the US would type in 04012010.p  pIs there an easy, elegant solution to thisp  pThanks for any suggestions.p

So the first response gets back after approx. 5 seconds, next after 10 seconds and so on.p  pThats a very simplified version of what I do, since the real script involves using cURL in PHP and jQuery as JS lib. But the problem remains the same.p  pWhy do responses come back in 5 second intervalsp

Negative 34469 pI have a WCF service hosted in a windows service. This WCF service is only going to be used on the local machine so I have chosen named pipes for endpoint. However when I try to connect to WCF service from the client instantiated by JavaScript in IE, strongendpoint is not foundstrong.p  pHowever if I stop the windows service and run the executable it can detect whether environment is user interactive or not then client can connect from IE as well.p  pBTW, I have tried setting security to None in binding configurations.p  pSo farp  pIE is running JavaScript in a lower integrity level than named pipe is created, which is normal since service has system integrity level. Question now is lowering the integrity level of created named pipe.p  pAnswerp  pI will leave this question to remind myself how stupid I am. Answer is hidden inside the question. As the executable detects that environment is user interactive, it runs all registered services in the executable. When you start a service manually, well, you start strongastrong service.p

Negative 34469 pIm working on an ERP application where multiple inventories need to be dynamically supported, ie. each depotbranch needs a separate stock value for each product. One approach  avoiding using static table columns  is to have a separate Stock table as followsp  precode[Product] Code ...  [Branch] Code ...  [Stock] ProductCode BranchCode StockValue ... codepre  pThis effectively becomes a manytomany relationship separated by the Stock table. Immediately there emappearsem to be pitfalls in this approach, for instancep  ul liIf there are 5 branches depots, and 50k product lines, then there will be 550k Stock lines. Is this excessiveli liEach time a Product is added, 5 new Stock lines need to be added  one for each Branch.li liEach time a Branch is added, 50k new Stock lines need to be added.li ul  pThe main rationale behind this is to avoid using static columns which may lead to modifying the mapping files as new Branches are added. So it is supposed to be more dynamic.p  pHas anyone worked with a similar concept in the past and may perhaps have a more efficient solution Or if this appears to be a suitable solution, then what NHibernate association method may be most effectivep  pThanks.p

Negative 34469 pHi I have two images of yeast platesp  pPermissivep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgXmKn.jpg altalt textp  pXgalp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comilT71.png altalt textp  pThe to images should be in the same spot and roughly the same size. I am trying to use one of the images to generate a grid and then apply that grid to the other image. The grid is made by looking at the colonies on permissive plate, the plate should have 1536 colonies on it.  The problem is that the camera that was used to take the images moves a bit up and down and the images can also be shifted slightly due to the other plate not being in exactly the same place. This then means that when I use the permissive plate to generate the grid on the xgal plate the grid shifts. Does anyone know a way in which I can compensate for this  I am using perl with the gd module.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank youp

Negative 34469 pIm creating a little puzzle game just as a hobby project but the project has now reached a point that there is quite a lot of code about 1500 lines. Although Ive tried to prevent it, the code has become messy. I definitely want to clean up the code and make it more maintainable and readable while I still can.p  pThere are 3 classes handling actions regarding puzzle pieces in my gamep  precodeclass PieceController     private arrayOfPieces     private selectedPiece     actions like select a piece, dropa piece   class Piece     private pieceID     private ArrayOfPieceStates     handles the initial creation of pieceStates and returns the current state   class PieceState     private stateDimensions      the particular rotation of a piece, aware of its dimensions.  codepre  pPropbably this structure should be redesigned as a whole but lets assume that its ok for just now.p  pThe problem There also is a JPanel that takes care of the graphics and it needs to be aware of the PieceState of the current puzzle piece to draw it. the drawing method of the panel then gets the dimensions with a request like p  precodePuzzleController.getPiece.getState.getDimensions  codepre  pThis seems like bad practice as it breaks encapsulation totally as Ive learned now. When I would deside to redesign the puzzle piece structure these chains of getters will breakp  pThen I thought I might follow the Tell dont ask principle for the drawingp  precodePieceController.drawPiecedrawingInfo  called by the graphics Panel Piece.drawPiecedrawingInfo  called by PieceController PieceState.drawStatedrawingInfo  called by Piece, now here we are aware of piece dimensions so drawing can take place. codepre  pnot that drawingInfo in the acutal code is a line of arguments that the drawing methods require. p  pIn some way Ive implemented encapsulation as the first drawPiece method is all the graphic panel needs and it doesnt need to worry about how the pieces are further structured. But now it feels like Ive only reversed the information dependency and havent made much progress. p  pfirst it was Drawing method needs the dimension information of current puzzlePieces state to draw. now it has become puzzlePieces state needs information about the graphical environment to perform drawing operations where on the screen to draw the piece for example.p  pnow when the drawing method of PieceState requires additional of different input and the declaration of this method changes it might require more information for example the calls to the drawing methods have to change all the way up.p  pstrongConclusion and actual questionstrong So basically the problem is old situation violated encapsulation, new situation might not but also doesnt seem like a solid implementation of the encapsulation principle. so my question is what are your ideas to improve this design How would you implement Puzzle pieces, their states and drawing operation on themp

Negative 34469 pAll,p  pIm looking for advice over the following scenariop  pI have a component running in one part of the corporate network that sends messages to an application logic component for processing. These components might reside on the same server, different servers in the same network LAN ot WAN or live outside in the cloud. The application server should be scalable and resilient.p  pThe messages are related in that the sequence they arrive is important. They are timestamped with the client timestamp.p  pMy thinking is that Ill get the clients to use WCF basicHttpBinding some are based on .NET CF which only has basic to send messages to the Application Server this is because we can guarantee port 80443 will be open for outgoing connections. Server accepts these, and writes these into a queue. This queue can be scaled out if needed over multiple machines.p  pIm hesitant to use MSMQ for the queue though as to properly scale out we are going to have to install seperate private queues on each application server and roundrobin monitor the queues. Im concerned though that we could lose a message on a server thats gone down until the server is restored, and we could end up processing a later message from a different server and disrupt the sequence.p  pWhat Id prefer is a central queue e.g. a database table that all application servers monitor.p  pWith this in mind, what Id like to do is to create a custom WCF binding, similar to netMsmqBinding, but that uses the DB table instead but Im confused as to whether I can simply create a custom transport or a I need a full binding, and whether the binding will allow the client to send over HTTP. Ive looked around the internet but Im a little confused as to where to start.p  pI could not bother with the custom WCF binding but it seems a good way to introduce scalability if I do need to seperate the servers.p  pAny suggestions please would be helpful, including alternatives. Many thanksp

Negative 34469 pIm going to start a new crossplattform openGL project primary for iPhone amp PC. So theres the main question targeting for OpenGL ES 1.1 or OpenGL ES 2.0 Or both So far I read Open GL ES 1.1 isnt really deprecated, isnt it So what would speak for openGL ES 2.0 Programmable vertex amp fragmentshader  Anything else I heard about performance decrease with alpha blending or so  can that be true I assume openGL ES 2.0 code should also run on PC  So is openGL ES 2.0 is really more future awarep  pThe other developers out there are still coding for OpenGL ES 1.1 or 2.0 And why I assume in case I choose openGL ES 2.0, there would be a lot of overhead for also backward compatibility with openGL ES 1.1. But there are a lot of iPhones out there without openGL ES 2.0 support  how should I accomplish this Any experience out therep  pI found only this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2274017opengles11or20oniphoneOpenGL ES 1.1 or 2.0 on iPhonea kind of relevant, but it isnt really deep about the implementation...

Negative 34469 pI have been using certain libraries in a C program to connect and fetch different websites. Mainly I used Chillkat and Curl. However, recently I started programming my own HTTP fetcher, using the help of MSDN and the Winsocket2 library.p  pI programmed my software to open a socket with SOCKETSTREAM type and for Ipv4,  and then I establish a connection with the required website, and send a GET request with Host and Connection close headers to the server.  Everything seems to work fine, However, the performance is not as I expected. The bundled Chillkat library still preforms better then mine. Even though I have optimized mine as much as I can.p  pI notice that when I send the request, some servers take longer time to respond. And once they do they send everything at once chunked. So how can I make a headerrequest that initiates a fast response Speed matters a lot for my program.p

Negative 34469 pI am running my code on SUSE Linux. I have a pointer which I make  NULL in a function. But the problem arises when I try to compare the same pointer with NULL in a while loop.

Both are excellent books, and I am refreshing my Obj C skills.p  pIn both editions, there is a listing for the Fraction with Classes program. It is listing 3.4 in the first edition, listing 3.2 in the second edition.p  pHere is listing 3.4 from the first editionp  precodeimport ltstdio.hgt import ltobjcObject.hgt Interface section interface Fraction Object      int numerator     int denominator   void print void setNumerator int n void setDenominator int d idinit  end  Implementation section  implementation Fraction void print      printf ii, numerator, denominator   void setNumeratorintn      numeratorn   void setDenominatorintd      denominatord   int numerator      return numerator   int denominator      return denominator   end   Implementation   Program section int main int argc, const char  argv[]      Fraction myFraction      myFraction[Fraction alloc]     myFraction[Fraction init]      [myFraction setNumerator1]     [myFraction setDenominator3]      printfThe value is     [myFraction print]     printfn      [myFraction free]      return 0  codepre  pThe second edition became much more AppleOS X centric. Instead of focusing on GCC, the text is more focused on xcode. Instead of the generic codeobjcObject.hcode import, the listing were translated to use the OS X Foundation class framework. p  pHere is listing 3.4 from the second editionp  precode program to work with fractions  class version    import ltFoundationFoundation.hgt     interface section     interface Fraction NSObject          int numerator       int denominator       void print   void setNumerator int n   void setDenominator int d    end    implementation section     implementation Fraction   void print          NSLog ii, numerator, denominator       void setNumerator int n          numerator  n       void setDenominator int d          denominator  d       end     program section     int main int argc, char argv[]          NSAutoreleasePool  pool  [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]        Fraction myFraction         Create an instance of a fraction        myFraction  [Fraction alloc]       myFraction  [myFraction init]         Set fraction to 13        [myFraction setNumerator 1]       [myFraction setDenominator 3]         Display the fraction using print method        NSLog The value of myFraction is       [myFraction print]       [myFraction release]        [pool drain]       return 0       codepre  pOf course the older version does not compile on the newer XCODE, and I do not find that terribly surprising. However, the older edition code no longer runs if compiled on recent versions of GCC on Linux or Windows. p  pThe specific runtime error is codeinit method not foundcode but the Kochan book states that the init method need not be defined on a class derived from codeObjectcode. Indeed you do not need to define codeinitcode codealloccode or codefreecode on codeNSObjectcode but gcc 4.2.1 warns that they are not defined for codeObject.code I am assuming that this code could be successfully compiled and executed when Kochan put out his first book. The Foundation classes and NSObject, I believe, are Apple only. p  pI can compile and run 30 yearold C code, but 7 year old Objective C is not longer useable Has Objective C, essentially, become an Apple only language with no real support outside of Apple only compilers and technologies That is the question. p

Negative 34469 pI am using jquery templates on both the serverside and clientside. Im using the jqtpl and express modules on Node.js for the server, and I have jquery and its template plugin for the client.p  pWherever possible the client recieves JSON instead of html, and builds the template itself, using the HTML5 history api to change url and allow session navigation. If this isnt possible, the server does the templating instead and sends html.p  pBoth the server and the client have the exact same templates, but the server has them in the form of 12 .html files, and the client has them in the form of an object in a .js file.p  pEach time I change or add a template, I have to alter the client .js file to be the same, which is a bit of a pain.p  pWhat I would like to do is have the .js file dynamically take all of the .html files in my templates folder and compile them into an object. Once I had finished development, this file would be cached, as it no longer needs to look for changes.p

Negative 34469 pIm trying to get the jQuery UI autocomplete widget to work but Im having some issues.br First, I tried to retrieve some data from the database and store them inside a hidden codeltpgtcode tag in the form of codeitem1  item2 item3code and then using jQuery reference this tag and get its content using code.htmlcode result was null or code.textcode result was empty string.

Why is it not working I made sure I added the CSS as well, so that shouldnt be the problem...p  pTheoretically, I would still want to retrieve the data from the database. In this instance, I would want just echo the tags to the html page and then do as described at the beginning. In other cases where the result could be too big, I would want to get them via AJAX but thats another story... I need to get this to work first and then Ill worry about that more complex scenarios p  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 34469 pSo, I have a rails 3 application using Devise to handle authentication.

Negative 34469 pI have a somewhat unusual scenario where I need to be able to outright slaughter hung, selfhosted codeWorkflowInstancecodes after a given timeout threshold.  I tried the codeAbortcode, codeTerminatecode and codeCancelcode methods but these are all too nice.  They all appear to require a response from the WorkflowInstance before they are honored.p  pIn my scenario, a workflow entered an infinite loop and was therefore unresponsive. Calls to the normal methods mentioned above would simply hang since the workflow was completely unresponsive.  I was surprised to learn the codeWorkflowRuntimecode does not appear have a mechanism for dealing with this scenario, or that codeAbortcode and codeTerminatecode are merely suggestions as opposed to violent directives.p  pI scoured googlemsdnstackoverflowetc trying to find out what to do when codeTerminatecode simply isnt going to get the job done and came up dry.

I originally did this only for media images but recently moved the themeskin files over the CDN as well.  This seems to be working great on the frontend, but Ive noticed a problem in the admin.  If I try to upload product images it fails after selecting the file in the popup.  It never shows me the extra box where I select which type of image it is and complete the upload.  This is only a problem when the unsecure skin URL is pointed at the CDN.  If I point it locally again, everything works fine.p  pMy guess is that it has something to do with the javascript that lives in the skin folders.  Some JS is theme based rather than being in the root codejscode folder, and I know that sometimes remotely hosted javascript can be an issue.  Our CDN URL is in our subdomain, though, so I would imagine that would be okay but I just dont know enough about this stuff.p  pHas anyone run into this or a similar problem  Any ideasp

Negative 34469 pThe datetime module does date validation and math which is fine when you care about reality.p  pI need an object that holds dates generated even if they were invalid. Date time is way too strict as sometimes I know year only or year and month only and sometimes I have a date like 20110230.p  pIs there a module out there that is like datetime but that can handle invalid datesp  pIf not, whats the best way to handle this while duplicating as little functionality as possible and still allowing date math when it is possible to performp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pMotivation for this is integration with multiple systems that use dates and dont care about invalid dates mysql and perl in addition to wanting the ability to tell basic general ranges of time. For fuzzy date math start from the beginning of the known unit of time if I know year and month but not day, use the first, if i know year but no month or day, use january first. This last bit is not necessary but would be nice and I get why it is not common as people who need special case date math will probably build it themselves.p  pOne of the major issues I have is loading dates from mysql into python using sqlalchemy and mysqldb  if you load a value from a date column im mysql that looks like 20110100 in mysql, you get None in python. This is not cool by any stretch.p

Negative 34469 pIm implementing a simple lazy functional language with LLVM as its backend in Haskell. Ive read two books written by Simon Peyton Jones The implementation of functional programming languages, as well as Implementing functional languages the tutorial and based on that I managed to implement the a hrefhttpgithub.cominsanekiviGMachine compiler and interpretera.p  pIm now currently stuck on the problem of generating LLVM IR code from GMachine instructions. The main problem is that GMachine is a stack machine whereas LLVM IR is a register machine. Thus in order to translate GMachine into LLVM IR I have to maintain some sort of runtime stack in LLVM IR please correct me if Im wrong. I was thinking of allocating subsequent stack nodes on the LLVM stack using its IR instructions, but then Id have to create that stack in a linkedlist manner, where each stack element has a pointer to the previous one and the first has a null pointer. This approach however is not very optimal and in case of Push n operation from GMachine it would have a complexity of On instead of preferred O1. Other idea might be to allocate whole blocks of memory instead of single cells.p  pMy question is whether you see a betterdifferent way of solving my problem.p

Negative 34469 pI would like to establish what is the order of the taskbar items in Windows 7. The reason is that I would like to create an script written in AutoHotkey or C that restore a set of icons to a previous determined order. I want to do this because any Virtual Desktop solutions for Windows forget the great and important point of keeping the taskbar items order, i.e between desktop changes the order of the taskbar items are completely ignored and lost. The reason of why they ignore that fact is maybe because all of them rely in the HIDEUNHIDE approach, they save what windows are active in any desktop and then between switches they Hide or UnHide the corresponding windows.p  pI already found a semi solution writted in QTC a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5931566locationofapponthewindows7taskbarLocation of app on the Windows 7 Taskbara that base his function in find the leftupper pixel position of an item based in his color.

Negative 34469 pIm quite new to openGL and I have been trying out some sample codes from a book about game programming on the iphone that Im currently reading.  One of the samples was a 3d game and I am able to successfully compile and run it on the iOS simulator fullscreen. p  pThe problem I have is when I run it on the actual hardware an ipod touch 4G, the game does not go full screen it only occupies like 14 of the screen. I was able to narrow the problem down to the code belowp  precodeGLint backingWidth, backingHeight   BOOL bindLayer  ....  glGetRenderbufferParameterivOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, GLRENDERBUFFERWIDTHOES, ampbackingWidth  glGetRenderbufferParameterivOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, GLRENDERBUFFERHEIGHTOES, ampbackingHeight  ....  codepre  pFor some reason, backingWidth and backingHeight is set to 640 and 960 respectively after the calls above I expected it to be 320 x 480 which is the iphones screen size. On the iOS simulator and an older ipod touch 2g, it works just fine. p  pThe code above is part of an object which subclasses UIView, and overrides the drawRect method it is empty though. The thing that baffled me is when I removed the drawRect method hence not overriding it, it somehow fixed the problem I described above. p  pCan anyone shed some light on this Is it not safe to override a views drawRect method when you are drawing in openGL Why does it work on the simulator and an older ipod touchp

Negative 34469 pWe have a server running Windows 7 Pro. I have several Python script Id like to save to the server and have it so that client computers can run them by simply doubleclicking. The client computers are all running OSX. This is proving to be... problematic.p  pFirst I tried to simply make the Python scripts executable, but this doesnt seem to be possible on a Windows server  since you cant set the executable flag, doubleclicking on a file will always open it in an editor unless I were to go to every single computer and make .py files open with Python. Trying to create a shell script has the same problem  theres no way to make them executable from the server.p  pMy solution was to just make a simple AppleScript app that sends a command to launch the script. Unfortunately, as soon as I copy the app to the server, it stops working. It seems that OSX apps refuse to execute properly when saved to the server  if you run the file, nothing happens at all.p  pIs there a simple solution Im overlookingp

Negative 34469 pI have a number of XML files that I need to parse. Ive written some code that works, but is ugly, and Id like to get some advice from people more experienced with XML than I am.p  pFirst of all, I might be using some terms in the wrong context, because my experience with XML is limited. By element, unless specified otherwise, I mean something like thisp  precode ltrootgt   ltelementgt    ...   ltelementgt   ltelementgt    ...   ltelementgt  ltrootgt   codepre  pAnyway, each file consist of a number of elements, with a number of child elements obviously.

The values are dictionaries with the keys attribute, node text, tag and parent element.p  pExamplep  precodefile1.xml  attributes  Person Id, Car  Color,                node text [Name, Address],  codepre  pWhere Person and Car are tags, and Id and Color are attribute names.p  pThis makes it easy to iterate over all elements and inspect each tag, and if there is a match in the dictionary if elem.tag in dict[file1.xml][attributes], extract the value.p  pSo as I said, the code works, but I dont like my solution. Also, not all the elements have all the child elements for example, a Person might not own a car, then that tag will be missing altogether, and I need to give assign those values None. Right now I get all the tags that should exist for every element in each file, turn them into a set, then check the difference between those and the set of tags that Ive actually extracted values from for that element. Again, the code is pretty ugly.p  pHopefully this mess makes some sense.p  peditp  pI used J.F. Sebastians suggestion of storing the xpath to each value in a dictionary with the field name as the key and xpath as value.p

Negative 34469 phow data is generated without user activity has never been quite clear to me. Lets say Im running a lottery and people can check the winning ticket number online. strongThis random number has to be automatically generated at a specific time and should be the same for every visitorstrong. How is that donep  pI figured I could use a PHP script which retrieves the previous number and check whether it is, say, over 7 days old. If it is, the script would then generate a new number and store it, so it will be retrieved when other users visit the page, in which case the number would simply be shown as its not over 7 days old. p  pThis method of doing things might cause trouble with multiple users both trying to access files at the same time or overwriting data which is simultaneously generated byfor another visitor. I think strongit would be better if the number could be generated and stored independently of user activity, so the PHP scripts only task is to read itstrong.p  pAny ideas would be much appreciatedp  pemP.S Im using simple webhosting and do not physically have access to the server, cant leave a .bat or .exe running I guess.

Negative 34469 pYet another potentially embarrassing question. Please feel free to point any obvious solution that may have been overlooked  I have searched for solutions previously and found nothing, but sometimes its a matter of choosing the wrong keywords to search for.br Heres the situation coded my own RequestHandler a few months ago for an enterprisey system, in order to inject a few necessary security parameters as an extra filter in all queries made to the solr core. Everything runs smoothly until the part where the docs resulting from a query to the index are collected and then returned to the user.p  pBasically after the filter is created and the query is executed we get a set of document ids and scores, but then we have to iterate through the ids in order to build the result set, one hit at a time  which is a good 10x slower that querying the standard requesthandler, and only bound to get worse as the number of results increase. Even worse, since our schema heavily relies on dynamic fields for flexibility, there is no way that I know of of previously retrieving the list of fields to retrieve per document, other than testing all possible combinations per doc. p  pThe code below is a simplified version of the one running in production, for querying the SolrIndexSearcher and building the response. p  pWithout further ado, my questions arep  ul liis there any way of retrieving all results at once, instead of building a response document by documentli liis there any possibility of getting the list of fields on each result, instead of testing all possible combinationsli liany particular WTFs in this code that I should be aware of Feel free to kick meli ul  precodefunction that queries index and handles results private void searchCoreSolrIndexSearcher searcher, Query query,          Filter filter, int num, SolrDocumentList results         Executes the query     TopDocs col  searcher.searchquery,filter, num      results     ScoreDoc[] docs   col.scoreDocs              iterate  build documents     for ScoreDoc hit  docs          Document doc  reader.documenthit.doc         SolrDocument sdoc  new SolrDocument          forObject f  doc.getFields              Field fd  Field f              strings             if fd.isStored  fd.stringValue  null                 sdoc.addFieldfd.name, fd.stringValue             else iffd.isStored                  Dynamic Longs                 if fd.name.matches.l                       ByteBuffer a  ByteBuffer.wrapfd.getBinaryValue,                              fd.getBinaryOffset, fd.getBinaryLength                     long testLong  a.getLong0                     sdoc.addFieldfd.name, testLong                                   Dynamic Dates                 else iffd.name.matches.dt                      ByteBuffer a  ByteBuffer.wrapfd.getBinaryValue,                          fd.getBinaryOffset, fd.getBinaryLength                     Date dt  new Datea.getLong                     sdoc.addFieldfd.name, dt                                   ...                                                results.addsdoc          codepre

Negative 34469 pAlright, Ive got this blank array of objects.  I am dynamically finding every node in a web page and each node is going to have its own object and properties. I need a way to throw the values I need into their respective objects propertyp  pSo, for example, I find the codebodycode node. I now have a special little object for this node. I need to throw pretty much everything about this little guy into his objects properties.p  pSo I pretty much need it to render like thisp  pTurning thisp  precodelthtmlgt     ltbody stylemargin0 padding0 titleMy Titlegt         ltpgtsome textltpgt         ltdiv classwrappergtltdivgt         ltfootergtltfootergt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pInto thisp  precodethis.nodesInfo  [  All nodes in the pages DOM              type body,  ex body, section, aside, div, etc.         id myID,  the Id of that element         class [myClass1, myClass2],  the classclass of that element         depth 2,  the level in the pages DOM in which that element sits, this will be an integer         parent html,  that elements direct parent Node          children[div.wrapper, p, footer],  any child Nodes that, that element may be a parent to         text ,  the text inside that element if any exists         attributes [stylemargin0 padding0, titleMy Title]  all attributes of this node      ] codepre  pIt would of course cycle through each node it discovered and do this for each node accordingly, until it ran out of nodes.p  pThe class, children, and attributes properties are arrays for the simple possibility of multiples of any of these. Everything else is just a string since a node cant have more than one ID, title, or direct parent tag.p  pIf a node does not contain some of these properties then that property would remain blanknullundefined.p  hr  pMy question is simple. Is this possible, if not would I instead have to create each object individually and the push them into my codenodesInfocode arrayp  pI think the easiest way to go about this would be making an object of each Node and then pushing them all once they are all created into an array.p

In the documentation it says Removes all items not in the headers from the view so that has left me asking, do the contents of the table just hide does it get deleted Im not exactly sure. My theory is that clearContents only hides the items and any next attempts to populate the table actually deletes and removes each item then allocates a new one to set on the table which in turn is an expensive operation.p  pAnother interesting thing is that Qts documentation on QTableWidget suggests that the proper way to populate a QTableWidget is to allocate a QTableWidgetItem on heap then set it on a table cell with setItem just like i presented in the code above, which I find to be wierd...p  pstrongIN SUMMARYstrongp  pIs there an alternate way to populate and repopulate a Qt table without having all of these problems if not, is there a way to fix these problemsp

Negative 34469 pIm encountering an issue while using a webview. My app is currently a portrait application, but when a media player loads in a webview within my app, the user can rotate the player, which rotates my view controller as well. I know I can get a notification for when the player comes up and disappears, but is there a way to prevent it from rotating the controller in the first placep  pIt doesnt seem like anyone has an answer. I have all of the standard dont rotate unless if I tell you to methods and plist values, but its still rotating. Its only when I load up a webview and the media player loads over it. If I rotate my device, the media player rotates along with it, which feels natural, but when I go back to the webview view controller, its rotated, which isnt good.p
Negative 34469 pAfter starting to work with configurations hence more than one store files the managed object context save operation failed due to missing persistent store file information for newly inserted objects.p  pApple states under codeassignObjecttoPersistentStorecodep  blockquote   pIt is only necessary to use this method if the receivers persistent store coordinator manages multiple writable stores that have objects entity in their configuration. Maintaining configurations in the managed object model can eliminate the need for invoking this method directly in many situations.

Negative 34469 pI have a problem that has been driving me crazy and Id appreciate any thoughts you guys may have to offer. I import data from a CSV file using openCSV into a database, and previously this process has been completed in about 35 seconds including the download time from a server. The CSV file has 3035 records. Ive tried separating the parsing from CSV and inserting to the table, but to no avail.p  pAs strange as it may sound suddenly something has changed within my application where now this process takes much much longer.p  pAfter narrowing it down Ive found that inserting into the table is extremely slow for SQLite. Ive spent the last couple hours reverting back to older code to see if something has changed but to no luck. p  pI came across some similar question whose answer suggest me to use InsertHelper, which I did. Which made absolutely no difference in the import time. Currently inserting data takes 60 seconds, where it used to take just a couple.p  precodepublic void importFromCSV       SQLiteDatabase db  this.getReadableDatabase     db.execSQLDELETE FROM EXAMS     File SDCardRoot  Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory     File file  new FileSDCardRoot.getAbsolutePath  FinalsDatatimetable.csv     CSVReader reader     int i  0     try          reader  new CSVReadernew FileReaderfile         String [] nextLine         while nextLine  reader.readNext  null                              this.addExamnew ExamnextLine[0],                                   nextLine[1],                                   nextLine[2],                                   nextLine[3],                                   nextLine[4],                                   nextLine[5],                                   nextLine[6],                                   nextLine[7],                                   nextLine[8],                                   nextLine[9]                           catch FileNotFoundException e          e.printStackTrace      catch IOException e          e.printStackTrace           public void addExamExam exam      SQLiteDatabase db  this.getReadableDatabase     ContentValues values  new ContentValues     values.putKEYSESSION, exam.getSession     values.putKEYAWARDINGBODY, exam.getAwardingBody     values.putKEYQUALIFICATION, exam.getQualification     values.putKEYTITLE, exam.getTitle     values.putKEYEXAMCODE, exam.getExamCode     values.putKEYDURATION, exam.getDuration     values.putKEYDATE, exam.getDate     values.putKEYSTARTTIME, exam.getStartTime     values.putKEYEXAMNOTE, exam.getExamNote     values.putKEYMYNOTES, exam.getMyNotes      db.insertTABLENAME, null, values   codepre

Negative 34469 pOn one of my servers which is being used for some internal development spaces and the likes, are configured with Apache, Git, Subversion among other things. The VirtualHost configuration is nothing out of the ordinary and I thought I had full control and understanding of this servers configuration and how it runs. I guess I was wrong. I recently discovered that all requests, no matter what VirtualHost I try, return the Subversion favicon when accessing codeltvhostgt.ltdomaingtfavicon.icocode. This puzzled me  and annoyed me a bit since I was convinced that I knew all about this servers configuration.p  pIt doesnt seem to pose any problems but Im annoyed that there is a configuration somewhere which does something I explicitly didnt ask for. So Ive been trying to track down this configuration but so far with no luck.p  pThe server is running Gentoo Linux, so I figured I was looking for a codeltLocationgtcode block somewhere in my Apache configuration.

However Id like to avoid the complicated stack calls that jquery would require. if possible.p  pIve created an example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnAE2f relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netnAE2fap  pWhats working in the examplep  pThe Add button, creates a new object. The Save Button will save it to the array. The Select Dialog will update with a new Option.p  pUnfortunately, this is where my progress has halted. While the Select Option is created, it doesnt reflect the underlying objects Name. Also Switching between objects doesnt change the forms properties as I would expect.p  pIve tried assigning the optionValue to the id, but in that case the Select Options isnt created on save. p

Negative 34469 pI am currently using the following code to count the number of steps a user takes in my indoor navigation application. As I am holding the phone around my chest level with the screen facing upwards, it counts the number of steps I take pretty well. But common actions like a tap on the screen or panning through the map register step counts as well. This is very frustrating as the tracking of my movement within the floor plan will become highly inaccurate.

Negative 34469 pEmacs 24 added optional lexical bindings for local variables. I would like to use this functionality in my module, while maintaining compatibility with XEmacs and the previous Emacs versions.p  pBefore Emacs 24, the easiest way to get closures was by using the codelexicalletcode form defined in codeclmacscode, which emulated lexical scope with some clever macro trickery. While this was never hugely popular among elisp programmers, it did work, creating real and efficient closures, as long as you remembered to wrap them in codelexicalletcode, as in this pseudocodep  precodedefun fooopentag tag data   Maybe open TAG and return a function that closes it.    ... do the work here, initializing state ...    return a closure that explicitly captures internal state   lexicallet var1 var1 var2 var2 ...     lambda        ... use the captured vars without exposing them to the caller ...        codepre  pThe question is what is the best way to use the new lexical bindings, while retaining support for Emacs 23 and for XEmacs Currently I solved it by defining a packagespecific macro that expands into codelexicalletcode or into ordinary codeletcode depending on whether codelexicalbindingcode is bound and truep  precodedefmacro foolexlet amprest letforms   if and boundp lexicalbinding            lexicalbinding       let ,letforms     lexicallet ,letforms put foolexlet lispindentfunction 1  ... at the end of file, turn on lexical binding if available  Local Variables  lexicalbinding t  End codepre  pThis solution works, but it feels clunky because the new special form is nonstandard, doesnt highlight properly, cant be stepped into under codeedebugcode, and generally draws attention to itself. Is there a better wayp  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTwo examples of ideas for smarter not necessarily good solutions that allow the code to continue using standard forms to create closuresp  ul lipUse an advice or a compiler macro to make codelexicalletcode expand to codeletcode under codelexicalbindingscode iff the codelexicalletcode only assigns to symbols which are lexically scoped anyway. This advice would only be temporarily activated during bytecompilation of codefoo.elcode, so that the meaning of codelexicalletcode remains unchanged for the rest of Emacs.pli lipUse a macrocodewalker facility to compile codeletcode of nonprefixed symbols to codelexicalletcode under older Emacsen. This would again only apply during bytecompilation of codefoo.elcode.pli ul  pDo not be alarmed if these ideas smell of overengineering I am not proposing to use them asis. Im interested in the alternatives to the above macro where the package gets the benefit of nicer portable emusageem of closures for the price of some additional complexity of loadingcompilation.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pAs no one has stepped up with a solution that would allow the module to keep using codeletcode or codelexicalletcode without breaking them for the rest of Emacs, I am accepting Stefans answer, which states that the above macro emisem the way to do it. In addition to that, the answer improves on my code by using codeboundandtruepcode and adding an elegant declaration for edebug and lispindent.p  pIf someone has an alternative proposal for this compatibility layer, or an elegant implementation of the above ideas, I encourage them to answer.p

Negative 34469 pI am working on an android app and using Fragments in UI layouts. In one of the fragments i needed to use a datetime picker behind a button click. I downloaded a sample datetime picker application which was implemented using dialogs in activity and i was having trouble to get it to work behind button click which was in a fragment. So what i did i just called the datetime picker activity from that button using intent which displays the datetime picker in dialog. Now after setting the date and time using picker I want that on clicking OK button i traverse back to that fragment which called this activity and update the selected Date and Time from picker in a textview. How to achieve thatp  pNote that datetime picker activity is different from the activity in which fragments are created.p

Ive tried to set the preferredSize as well as the minimumSize of that panel, but no matter what I do, it shows only a 12x12 portion of that panel.p  pHeres my Grid classp  precodepackage gui  import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Graphics import java.util.Map  import javax.swing.BorderFactory import javax.swing.JPanel  import collections.MapUtils import executor.Robot  public class Grid extends JPanel      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L     private int rs  GUI.ROBOTSIZE      private final int width     private final int height     private final MapltCoord, Colorgt colors      private int rx     private int ry      public Gridint width, int height          this.width  width         this.height  height          colors  MapUtils.hashMap         forint i  0 i lt width i                 forint j  0 j lt height j                 colors.putnew Coordi, j, Color.WHITE          rx  width2         ry  height2         setPreferredSizenew Dimensionwidth  rs, height  rs         setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.CYAN           public int getWidth          return width           public int getHeight      return height   public void updateRobot robot      this.rx  width2  robot.getX     this.ry  height2  robot.getY      repaint   Override public void paintComponentGraphics g      super.paintComponentg     forMap.EntryltCoord, Colorgt es  colors.entrySet          g.setColorColor.RED           g.setColores.getValue         Coord c  es.getKey         g.fillRectc.getXrs, c.getYrs, rs, rs           g.setColorColor.BLACK     forint i  0 i lt width i         g.drawLineirs, 0, irs, heightrs     forint i  0 i lt height i         g.drawLine0, irs, widthrs, irs      g.setColorColor.DARKGRAY     g.drawOvalrxrs, ryrs, rs, rs     g.setColorColor.LIGHTGRAY     g.fillOvalrxrs, ryrs, rs, rs   codepre  pAnd this is how it looks like note the 12x12 red square in the top left corner, which should be the grid a hrefhttpimageshack.usaimg818354549409190.png relnofollowhttpimageshack.usaimg818354549409190.pngap  pThe panel itself is resized correctly, but the graphics dont fill it. I dont know, maybe Im overlooking something simple, but right now I dont know what to do. How can I make it paint the whole gridp  pEDIT Ah now I feel stupid. My mistake was to name the getters getWidth and getHeight which were overriding the methods from JComponent. After renaming them it is working perfectly fine.p

Theoretically, TPCircularBuffer would have my audio info saved. p  pHowever, when I activate rioplaying to be YES in the playback Callback, I simply hear some jittery sound that has no semblance of what I recorded. p  pAm I using the buffer correctly Or is this usually done another way p  pThanks. p  pPier. p  precodestatic OSStatus recordingCallbackvoid inRefCon,                                AudioUnitRenderActionFlags ioActionFlags,                                const AudioTimeStamp inTimeStamp,                                UInt32 inBusNumber,                                UInt32 inNumberFrames,                                AudioBufferList ioData   RIO rio  RIOinRefCon AudioUnit rioUnit  riogttheAudioUnit ExtAudioFileRef eaf  riogtoutEAF AudioBufferList abl  riogtaudioBufferList  SInt32 samples[NUMBEROFSAMPLES]  A large enough size to not have to worry about buffer overrun abl.mNumberBuffers  1 abl.mBuffers[0].mData  ampsamples abl.mBuffers[0].mNumberChannels  1 abl.mBuffers[0].mDataByteSize  inNumberFrames   sizeofSInt16  OSStatus result result  AudioUnitRenderrioUnit,                           ioActionFlags,                           inTimeStamp,                          inBusNumber,                           inNumberFrames,                           ampabl  if noErr  result  NSLogObtain recorded samples error    React to a recording flag, if recording, save the abl into own buffer, else ignore if riogtrecording         TPCircularBufferProduceBytesampriogtbuffer, abl.mBuffers[0].mData, inNumberFrames   sizeofSInt16     NSLogRecording   else      NSLogNot Recording   once stop recording save the circular buffer to a temp circular buffer      return noErr   static OSStatus playbackCallbackvoid inRefCon,                               AudioUnitRenderActionFlags ioActionFlags,                               const AudioTimeStamp inTimeStamp,                               UInt32 inBusNumber,                               UInt32 inNumberFrames,                               AudioBufferList ioData       RIO rio  RIOinRefCon  int bytesToCopy  ioDatagtmBuffers[0].mDataByteSize SInt16 targetBuffer  SInt16ioDatagtmBuffers[0].mData   Pull audio from playthrough buffer int32t availableBytes  if riogtplaying      SInt16  tempbuffer  TPCircularBufferTailampriogtbuffer, ampavailableBytes     memcpytargetBuffer, tempbuffer, MINbytesToCopy, availableBytes     TPCircularBufferConsumeampriogtbuffer, MINbytesToCopy, availableBytes     NSLogPlaying  else     NSLogPlaying silence     for int i  0  i lt ioDatagtmNumberBuffers i     get the buffer to be filled     AudioBuffer buffer  ioDatagtmBuffers[i]     UInt32 frameBuffer  buffer.mData      loop through the buffer and fill the frames        for int j  0 j lt inNumberFrames j            frameBuffer[j]  0                  return noErr  codepre

Negative 34469 pIve written a BHO for Internet Explorer that hooks WinInet to modify some HTTP requests from IE by redirecting them to an internal server.p  pIt works fine when I open the first 3 tabs in IE as a new iexplore.exe process is created for each tab, each loading the BHO. p  pTroubles appear when there are more than 4 tabs instead of creating a new iexplore.exe process, existing processes are reused in different thread. I can either hook the same process multiple times 1 per thread, or just once. In both cases, crashes happen when tabs are closed.p  pExample open tabs 1 separate iepxlore.exe, 2 separate iepxlore.exe, 3 separate iepxlore.exe and 4 share iexplore with tab 1. Close tab 1. Refresh tab 4, IE crashes inside NDTDLL.DLL. The crash happen if i I dont do anything inside the hooked WinInet.ddl just call the old functionp  pIf I hook WinInet only once per iexplore.exe process, I cannot intercept requests in all tabs.  p  pIm wondering what is the best way to proceed. All examples Ive found so far assume that there is 1 iexpolore.exe process per tab.p  pThe WinInet hook code is based on a a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles38616RetrieveHttpOnlySessionCookieinWebBrowser relnofollowCode Project examplea, I just hook fewer functions.p  pIt looks like a pointer to he old WinInet function, or to the one I created, is no longer valid.p

So what i am trying to do is to connect instance 1 with instance 4 with IP Address and PORT instead of just using just the IP Address as is the case with a single TCPListener.p

Negative 34469 pI have searched high and low for an answer to this problem. Basically, I am creating a C application which In its first incarnation will authenticate with the Projectplace API which uses OAuth 1.0a. It currently returns the oauthverifier to the address bar, but when I use the codevar response  request.GetResponsecode method, it returns the codeoauthtokencode and codeoauth tokensecretcode which I sent as part of the authorization in the first place.p  pPerhaps I am misunderstanding the way this process is supposed to work, but Ive read every single answer out there and none seem to address this question. Do you have to, or is it possible, to pull the verifier code from the address bar or wherever else it can be obtained, after I have entered my username and password on the authentication page after callback URL is loadedp  pI believe OAuth1.0a requires the verification code to retrieve an access token, and I cannot find a simple way to pull the verification code.p  pI would really appreciate any help, its driving me nutsp  pUPDATED 03.12.12p  pThanks for your responsep  pEssentially, I am the client attempting to retrieve the oauthverifier from the oauth provider after sending this initial request below, my next step is to authorize then retrieve verifier.

Negative 34469 pSo this is probably a weird question, but I have a reasonably good reason for asking.p  pThe gist of my question is, given an example with two levels of derivation on a class hierarchyp  pMain Base Classp  precodeclass Animal    virtual void Draw  0  codepre  pDerived Class p  precodeclass Dog  public Animal    virtual void Draw         draw a generic dog icon or something...     codepre  pFurther Derivationp  precodeclass Corgi  public Dog    virtual void Draw         draw a corgi icon...     codepre  pNow, Id love to be able to, from within the codeCorgicode class, permanently downcast the this pointer to a codeDogcode pointer and then pass it off somewhere else as an Animal. This other place will then be able to call the codeDrawcode function and get the codeDogcode method, not the virtual codeCorgicode method. I know this is strange, but again, I have a vaguely legitimate reason for wanting to do it.p  pIve tried all the different casting operators and havent had any luck, but maybe there is a consistent way of pulling this off In the past Ive caused myself trouble by not properly using codedynamiccastcode which resulted in a similar state for a pointer. Perhaps this time I can use that to my advantagep  pstrongEditstrong Perhaps the above example doesnt illustrate clearly the what Im trying to achieve, so Ill elaborate with my real goal.p  pIm trying to achieve a shorthand for registering base class implementations that link into a scripting system Ive been using for a while. The scripting system relies on a base class codeIScriptContextcode to facilitate access to realcode functions and member variable access. Internally base classes register their member function addresses and member variable addresses which are later dispatchedaccessed through lookup tables. Im in the process of adding proper support for class derivation hierarchies to the scripting system, and I figured being able to isolate the base class versions of these interfaces would help save time and make the whole process cleaner for me when it comes time to register available base classes with the script interpreter. There are other ways to achieve this, such as registering class specific function pointers for each required method for each available base class e.g. codethisgtDogCallFunctioncode, codethisgtDogSetMembercode, codethisgtDogGetMembercode. However, I figured using an interface would allow me to modify things a bit easier down the road if I ever needed to.p  pI hope all of that makes some kind of sense.p  pThanksp

Negative 34469 pIn experimenting with transferring files over networks in Java, Ive found that buffers  64k give best performance. However from what Ive seen googling around such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2374951492861herea, most people recommend smaller buffers of 832k because it can fit in the CPU cache. Is that factor important when transferring large volumes of data Would it be better to sacrifice better network throughput and go with the smaller buffer this includes Android devices too, perhaps any low power devicep

Negative 34469 pI have prototyped a library with some imageprocessing algorithms in PythonNumpyScipy, and now I want to port the code to C and WPF.p  pI have realized that, although the input files are images photographs, conceptually what matters to my domain problem is that they are bidimensional arrays of floats, and the operations I perform grayscale conversion, blur, blob detection, skeletonization, and even persistence, are best performed in floatingpoint space, rather than in integer space which means bytes  uint8 , usually.p  pSo, I took a look at .NET namespaces, and there are a lot of Drawing this, Imaging that, Media something, and I am utterly confused.p  pSo, the question is Which .NET class is the most obvious and commonly used image data container for floating point image processing.p  pI know about AForge, but since I am learning C and my imageprocessing needs are not so heavy at this point, Id like to give native .NET a chance but that could be a bad idea anyway, so please let me know if it is.p

Negative 34469 pIm implementing a BagofWords image classifier using OpenCV. Initially Ive tested SURF descriptors extracted in SURF keypoints. Ive heard that Dense SIFT or PHOW descriptors can work better for my purposes, so I tried them too.p  pTo my surprise, they performed significantly worse, actually almost 10 times worse. What could I be doing wrong Im using DenseFeatureDetector from OpenCV to get keypoints. Im extracting about 5000 descriptors per image from 9 layers and cluster them into 500 clusters.p  pShould I try PHOW descriptors from VLFeat library Also I cant use chi square kernel in OpenCVs SVM implementation, which is recommended in many papers. Is this crucial to the classifier quality, should I try another libraryp  pAnother question is the scale invariance, I suspect that it can be affected by dense feature extraction. Am I rightp

However we are thinking to add 2 factor authentication to the ADFS not only on browser based passive profile basically customize the login page, but also active profile such as end point servicestrust13UsernameMixed. The only approach I could think of is to intercept the request into the ADFS server, I heard that ADFS end points are WCF end points, however I did not see a configuration file at ADFS folder the installation is at the cwindowsADFS at my 2012 server. Otherwise, I am thinking to use WCF behavior extension maybe some other approach if you know to intercept the request, however so far I didnt see how I could do that. I am new to ADFSWCF, any insight on this would be highly appreciated. Maybe I am trying to attempt something which is impossible.p  pAt this point, we dont really want to use another STS to let ADFS federate with it. It would be too big a change at customer ADFS env.

This SQL i execute with context.Database.SqlQuerysql and the data is populated just fine, and the performance is very good. p  pMy questions are p  ol lipIs there any way I can replace the int lastUser from ForumWith with an actual user object User lastUserObject without having to loop over the result set and populate it manualy from the context.Users. pli lipIs there a better way to do this kind of aggregations through linqEF while keeping the performance pli ol  pSQL p  precodeSELECT  dbo.Forum.ForumID ,         dbo.Forum.Name ,         COUNTDISTINCT dbo.Topics.TopicID AS topics,         COUNTDISTINCT MessageID AS messages,          MAXdbo.Messages.CreatedDate AS lastDate,          SELECT UserName FROM [User] where UserId           CONVERTINT,SUBSTRINGmaxCONVERTvarchar,dbo.Messages.CreatedDate,20    CONVERTVARCHAR,dbo.Messages.CreatedByUserId,20,21,10 AS lastUser FROM dbo.Forum      LEFT JOIN dbo.Topics ON dbo.Forum.ForumID  dbo.Topics.ForumID     LEFT JOIN dbo.Messages ON dbo.Topics.TopicID  dbo.Messages.TopicID GROUP BY  dbo.Forum.ForumID ,         dbo.Forum.Name  codepre

Negative 34469 pI have several existing webapps deployed as standalone war files in the app container resin. Some use axis2 jar files and axis2generated Stub files to make calls to external SOAP based web services. They were all working fine prior to this.p  pI recently deployed axis2.war to the same container in order to create web services unrelated to the client code mentioned above. p  pAs soon as I restart the app container, client calls to the external webservices seem to be intercepted by my newly deployed axis2.war.  Services appear temporarily in the Available Services page of the axis2 webapp, with what appears to be randomly generated name based on the original external webservice name. p  pThese services disappear shortly after, but the result is that my client code fails with a 500 error, as the local Axis2.war doesnt know how to handle those requests.p  pI have been searching for 2 days and havent found mention of anyone experiencing anything similar. I am not even sure how to explain what is going on, as my client code never references localhost to make those web service calls. I am assuming this has to do with some configuration in axis2.warp  pIf anyone has any idea or insight into what might be happening, I would really appreciate any information.p  pThanks for your helpp

I am also sure that right server instance was choosen and there is no PORT conflict.p  pEJB module is fine for sure, before I did it with Eclipse i was working with Netbeans and all was fine  i am using different instances of glassfish for eclipse and netbenas, so its not a reason of my problem.p  pHere is server log a hrefhttppastebin.comRDwNAzs8 relnofollowhttppastebin.comRDwNAzs8a I put it to pastebin, becouse of it huge content.p  pGreetingsp
Negative 34469 pI have this weird problem in IE 9. I have a site which allows a user to login and can also be logged in by a separate website using web service in the background. When logged in, a cookie is created. In fiddler, I can see the user has logged in to my site from the third party website and the cookie is created. The third party site makes an ajax call and the cookie is created in my domain.p  pBut when I click on a link to my site from the third party site, the login page is displayed again. I wrote a debug code that states in the page that the cookie does not exist but I can see in IE settings that the cookie does exist. The cookie expires in 24 hours.p  pHow do I fix it By the way, it works fine in most other browsers including IE8, IE7, Chrome.p  pThis is similar to  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10895558ie9separatecookiesforthirdpartyrequestIE9 Separate cookies for third party requesta  but there is no response there.p

Negative 34469 pI have a very unique problem, and I am not sure as to how I should tackle it, whether there is a best way to tackle it, andor if this is a design pattern flaw.p  pThe reason for asking is that I believe I should not have to rewrite functions for the same functionality. Take below the example codep  precode function Divconfig        var config  config        this.element  document.createElementdiv      this.setSizeconfig.width  0, config.height  0     Div.prototype.setSize  functionwidth, height        this.setWidthwidth      this.setHeightheight     Div.prototype.setWidth  functionwidth        this.element.style.width  width  px     Div.prototype.setHeight  functionheight        this.element.style.height  height  px     Div.prototype.appendTo  functionelement        element.appendChildthis.element   codepre  pYou can see that the above code allows me to create codedivcode tags. I can easily create html divs, set their size and append them to other elements.p  pI also have an codeOverlaycode object which needs to inherit codeDivcode. At first I decided to set codeDivcode as codeOverlaycodes prototype.p  precode function Overlayconfig         var config  config         this.setSizeconfig.width, config.height     Overlay.prototype  new Div codepre  pThis worked fine, but the problem arises because codeOverlaycode is essentially a codeDivcode with some added functionality. As the codeOverlaycode object has codeDivcode as its prototype it only points to one div element, whereas each instance of codeOverlaycode should have its own div element.p  pI then decided to make codeDivcode a property of codeOverlaycodep  precode function Overlayconfig        var config  config        this.div  new Divconfig   codepre  pThis also works fine, but now when creating instances of codeOverlaycode I would have to use it like sop  precode var overlay  new Overlay  overlay.div.setSize100, 100 codepre  pRather thanp  precode var overlay  new Overlay  overlay.setSize100, 100 codepre  pTo tackle this I created new prototypal functions on codeOverlaycode to simplify using it, codeOverlaycode as it stands now looks like thisp  precode function Overlayconfig        var config  config        this.div  new Divconfig     Overlay.prototype.setSize  functionwidth, height        this.div.setWidthwidth      this.div.setHeightheight     Overlay.prototype.setWidth  functionwidth        this.div.setWidthwidth     Overlay.prototype.setHeight  functionheight        this.div.setHeightheight     Overlay.prototype.appendTo  functionelement        this.div.appendToelement   codepre  pCreating codeOverlaycode like this is exactly how I want the functionality for codeOverlaycode to be, but it seems very wrong to me that this is how it should be done as I am literally writing functions for the sake of ease of use, and as codeDivcode grows in size maintainability would become a real pain.p  pWhereas setting codeDivcode as codeOverlaycodes prototype seems the correct way to do things, but in my case it obviously isnt as then all instances of codeOverlaycode are tied to the same div element.p  pHow can I create both a codeDivcode object, and an codeOverlaycode object, where codeOverlaycode will have its own instance of codeDivcode but will also inherit all of codeDivcodes functionality to its prototype Is there a pattern that I should be using to tackle this problem I am facingp  pI am literally stuck as to where to go from here, but I think I am pretty sure that the way I am doing it now is not the correct wayp  pThanks for taking the time to read my question.p

Negative 34469 pI have some HTML files that need to be printed out, but they are 2 pages long. I need them to be 1 page long and I dont want to have to fiddle with the HTML code endlessly to shrink it just a tiny bit. I know each HTML file can be opened and zoom resized in any HTML reader and then printed out and the problem is solved, however there are... A LOT of files and having to manually open each file, resizing it and then printing out each one individually isnt really a good solution for me. More HTML files will be generated.p  pIf I could create a quick little application that takes an HTML file and shrinks the file down from 2 pages to 1 page  will always be 2 pages  or if there is some way to programmatically do a print to fit page function I cant find anything in this regards to print functions in default C libraries yet. p

Negative 34469 pI apologize for my rather vague question, but I am at a bit of a loss. The documentation for MSDN API functionality is very confusing and convoluted to say the least, and I have been tasked to figure out a way to get the desired functionality mentioned in the title.p  pBasically, my intent is to create an API using SOAP that sends out data to a separate instance of the same application, with the intent of emsynchronizing their databasesem. It is important that this data is strongsentstrong by the primary database, and not strongrequestedstrong by the receiving end, as that could create a security hole in the architecture if our primary database was that open.p  pI dont want to simply ask for code, but a very lightweight example of how this could be achieved on both ends would be extremely helpful. I dont really have anything significant to show other than a very simple Test Service. p

Negative 34469 pI have a Standalone Java application.

This stop script has to shutdownclose this java application gracefully. p  pTo achieve this I am planning to take the following stepsp  pstrong1.strong When my java application runs it will store the processid of the launched application in a file i.e. in a known file myapplication.pid. p  pLooks like ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean.getName call will work on both Linux and Windows to get the process ID.

Negative 34469 pI am having a problem with memory management in objective C. Ive been reading through the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualMemoryMgmtArticlesMemoryMgmt.html relnofollowAdvanced Memory Management Programming Guidea but I cannot find a solution to my problem with the possible exception of abandoning ARC altogether and managing the memory manually.p  pHere is the problemp  pI have a codeControllercode class that Ive made, that holds information on what to do at specific times.p  pThe codeControllercode class tells the rest of the app to play a video for example. The video plays fine. When the video finishes playing, the codeControllercode class knows what to do next.p  pUnfortunately the codeControllercode class is released and deallocated by ARC almost as soon as the video starts playing. So by the time the video ends, the app calls the codeControllercode class to see what it should do next, and the whole thing crashes. I get an codeEXCBADACCESScode because the class is no longer in memory.p  pI get that ARC is releasing my codeControllercode class because after it has told the video to start playing, its not doing anything. But I want to keep hold of that class until I need it again.p  pI am declaring this class as a property, like sop  precodeproperty strong, nonatomic Controller  controller codepre  pBut despite this, ARC keeps releasing the class as soon as its not doing anything.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve moved this property into the App Delegate. But ARC is still releasing it. I cant turn this into a Singleton, as I need the potential to have multiple copies of this class.p  h1How can I stop ARC releasing objects when I dont want it toh1  h1Is it possible to keep an object in memory while its not doing anythingh1  pIs this possible at all Or should I abandon ARC and just do memory management manuallyp

Negative 34469 pWe published a daily blog starting in 1998, almost before the word blog was invented. We had static pages set up in a folder structure, but yearmonthdateindex.shtml  content herep  pWe switched to Wordpress in November of 2008 and are now scraping the archives 19982008 and converting to JSON... with Title, Description, Category, Date and then we are using a PHP widget to read the JSON, convert to xml and upload using the WP RSS uploader. The problem is the RSS loader is very buggy and is failing. It keeps telling us posts are already in the database, even though the new posts have a unique date string and content string. the upload file is very small, only 3 MB, PHP has plenty of memory 120MB and upload file limit is set to 32MBp  pWe note that if one manually adds a record to the wpposts table from the back end, using something like PHPMyAdmin, it works fine. Since the RSS import is broken, we want to try to bulk upload old posts directly into the wppost table, but we need to add the category also. I think this is done in the wptermrelationships table where the objectid  the postid in the post table.p  pCan anyone add more light on this Are their more dependencies that need to be inserted into other tables We are only interested in the post, no comments or anything else. I would also need to know what the standard if for the GUID field.p  pIf this is a really bad idea, then given the RSS uploader in 3.6 is broken, what can we do  Is did see the CVS importer plug in and we may try that... but I wanted to know if we can do it directly in PHPMyAdmin or some other standard tool for importing directly into the database. We just need to make sure the category gets inserted.p

Negative 34469 pOkay I am having a bit of a problem with javax communications API, I have created a small serial port listener program for a locking system that will register a user when they use the key pad to access a building. However when I run the program from my command prompt which is where the program will ultimately be ran from I get the same error everyone else that has trouble gets codejava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError javaxcommSerialPortEventListenercode which if I am correct means that it doesnt exist. I have followed all of the other solutions and downloaded the api put the codecomm.jarcode file into the codejdk1.7.025libcode and the codejdk1.7.025jrelibextcode, the codejavax.comm.propertiescode into the proper locations codeCProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.025libcode and codeCProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.025jrelibcode and the codewin32comm.dllcode into its respective places codeCProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.025jrebin, CProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.025bin, and CWindowsSystem32code I also compiled the program in the cmd prompt like normal codejavac UserSerial.javacode compiles fine but gets the error when I run it and like this codejavac classpath CProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.025jrelibextcomm.jar UserSerial.javacode compiles fine but when I run the program it says that it cant locate or load the main class when I run it with the class path like so codejava classpath CProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.025jrelibextcomm.jar User Serialcode when I just try to run it normally after the class path compilation it throws the same error. I have read the documentation, answers her, and other places and no answer I have found seems to work. I have also tried the same with the arduino RXTXcomm api and get the same error. The real kicker is that when I create compile and run the program in the NetBeans IDE it works beautifully including storing the infor to the specified files so that there is a master log.

Negative 34469 pIve got a console application that prompts the user to enter various inputs.

In particular, Id like the user to be able to enter a date range, to return all records created in that time period.p  pI could add two separate parameters to the function, such as lowerDateLimit and upperDateLimit.  But it seems neater to me to accept a pair of values as a tuple dateLimits, which would be of the form lowerDateLimit, upperDateLimit.p  pIs there any way for a user entering text in a console to be able to format their input so that Python would recognise it as a list or a tuplep  pOr would the more Pythonic thing to do be to just use two separate parameters for the lower and upper date limitsp

Which are not present in a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2013n3797.pdf relnofollowN3797a. p  pIs there any advantage of aliasing type to value metafunctions I think, it is possible to use them without those aliases, such as codeenableiftltisvoidltTgtvalue,Tgtcode or codeenableiftltisvoidltTgt,Tgtcode when the conversion operation is present. I guess codeisvoidltTgttypevaluecode is same as codeisvoidltTgtvaluecodep  pIf the type to value metafunctions need to be aliases, wont it be better to alias them as variable template  I do not have C14 compiler and never used variable template. So the syntax may be wrong  e.g. alias codeisvoidcode as p  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt constexpr bool isvoidt  isvoidltTgtvalue codepre  pInstead of p  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt using isvoidt  typename isvoidltTgttype codepre  pThen one can write codeenableiftltisvoidtltTgt,Tgtcode without boost style codeenableifcode,and composing expression will be easier e.g. codeenableiftltisvoidtltTgt  isintegraltltTgt,Tgtcodep

Negative 34469 pI am using scikit learn to build a GMM classifier. For testing I use a file X which contains a large number of rows, each row represents a feature vector [x,y,z].p  pFor examplep  precode[1,2,3] [2,2,3] [4,4,5] ... codepre  pI assign each row a corresponding class label. When I use the scikitlearn score function, it calculates the log probabilities of each data point in X. For my application this is not very useful because each test sample in my file represents a motion frame and recognition based on a single frame is not accurate. Instead, I would like to use a larger number of frames samples for testing and calculate the log likelihood on the basis of the group of samples rather than a single sample. This way I could recognize a person by looking at 30 seconds of their motion rather than looking at a very short single time frame.  Is this possible with scikitlearn and how can I accomplish thisp

Negative 34469 pSummary Im trying to parallelize my system using ThreadPoolExecutor and Im running into a deadlock issue. I know WHY Im getting the issue, but Im not very familiar with concurrency in context of java so Im not sure what classesmethods to usep  pSimple Example My code parses a large xmllike tree, and then spawns a thread for the top level instruction. This thread runs as it executes, it reads more of the xml tree and spawns more threads on the same ThreadPoolExecutor I use 1 pool because there is a userdefined maximum. This happens until the xml tree is consumed. p  pWhen enough parent threads end up in the threadpool and all their child threads are still in the queue, they deadlock because the parent threads are blocked on their children threads, who arent running. Lets say my tree isp  precodeParent thread  Child Thread A   Child Child Thread A1   Child Child Thread A2   Child Child Thread A3  Child Thread B  Child Thread C codepre  pI will now have the Parent thread, A, B, C, A1, A2, and A3 as threads. Lets assume my max threadpool is 2. This means that in the way it was parsed, P, A are in the thread pool and everything else is in the thread queue.p  pHere, every non leaf node will be blocked on the leaf nodes. Since the leaf nodes were parsed last, they arent even in the threadpool and instead in the queue. Thusly the leaf children never run, and the whole system is deadlocked.p  pQuestion Is there some method call to kick the parent thread out of the running threadpool as soon as it creates child threads Im wary of using callbacks because my system can initiate concurrency optionally, so I dont really want to clutter code on the children classes to call back on a parent thread that may not even exist. p  pAlso, how should I go about implementing some sort of thread queue picking algorithm priorityclocketc is ThreadPoolExecutor the right class to be using p  pThanks. p

Negative 34469 pI am trying to communicate with a process that itself writes to stdin and stdout to interact in a terminal with a user and read its stdin and write to its stdout in C. p  pHence I try to substitute a shell user programmatically. A methapohrical example Imagine I want to use VIM in C for some reason. Then I also need to write commands stdout and read stuff from the editor stdin.p  pInitially I thought this might be a trivial task, but it seems like theres no standard approach. codeint systemconst char commandcode just executes a command and sets the commands stdinstdout to the one of the calling process. p  pBecause this leads nowhere, I looked at codeFILE popenconst char command, const char typecode but the manual pages state thatp  blockquote   pSince a pipe is by definition unidirectional, the type argument may specify only reading or writing, not both the resulting stream is correspondingly readonly or writeonly.p blockquote  pand its implicationp  blockquote   pThe  return value from popen is a normal standard IO stream in all respects save that it must be closed with pclose rather than fclose3.  strongWriting to such a stream writes to the standard input          of the commandstrong the strongcommands standard outputstrong is the strongsame as that of the process that called popenstrong, unless this is altered by the command itself.  Conversely, strongreading from a popened stream reads          the commands standard outputstrong, and the strongcommands standard input is the same as that of the process that called popenstrong.p blockquote  pHence it wouldnt be completely impossible to use popen, but it appears to me very inelegant, because I would have to parse the stdout of the calling process the code that called popen in order to parse data sent from the popened command when using popen type w. p  pConversely, when popen is called with type r, I would need to write to the callings process stdin, in order to write data to the popened command. Its not even clear to me whether both these processes receive the same data in the stdin in this case...p  pstrongI just need to control stdin and stdout of a program.strong I mean cant there be a function likep  precodestdinofprocess, stdoutofprocess  realpopenpathtobin, rw  write some data to the process stdin writehello, stdinofprocess  read the response of the process readstdoutofprocess codepre  pSo my strongfirst questionstrong What is the best way to implement the upper functionalityp  pCurrently I am trying the following approach to communicate with another processp  ol liSet up two pipes with codeint pipeint fildes[2]code.

The first just writes a incremented number every 100 ms to its stdoutp  precodeinclude ltunistd.hgt include lttime.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  void sleepMsuint32t ms      struct timespec ts     ts.tvsec  0  ms  1000     ts.tvnsec  1000  1000  ms  1000     nanosleepampts, NULL   int mainint argc, char argv[]      long int cnt  0     char buf[0x10]  0      while 1          sleepMs100         sprintfbuf, ldn, cnt         if writeSTDOUTFILENO, buf, strlenbuf  1             perrorwrite       codepre  pNow the second program is supposed to read the stdout of the first program Please keep in my mind that I eventually want to read AND write with a process, so a technical correct solution to use popen for the upper use case might be right in this specific case, because I simplified my experiments to just capture the stdout of the bottom program. I expect from the bottom program that it reads whatever data the upper program writes to stdout. But it does not read anything.

Negative 34469 pIm trying to address a problem that seemingly is out of my hands, but hopefully can be fixed with a little .htaccess magic.p  pstrongBackground of the Problemstrongp  pI have an implementation of MediaWiki that currently uses an .htaccess file to prettify the URL. In the stock MediaWiki configuration without the modrewrite, each article in the wiki is normally accessed by visitingp  pwww.mywebsite.orgindex.phptitleGeorgeClooneyactorp  pWith the .htaccess code below, were able to clean this up so that the the same page can be accessed by going top  pwww.mywebsite.orgGeorgeClooneyactorp  pThis is all working as it should. Internally, theres no problem here.p  pstrongSummary of the Problemstrongp  pThe problem is a significant portion of my wikis traffic comes from vBulletin, which I have found has a bug with how it automatically parses URLs in members posts. When they add the link above, vBulletin parses the url into a BB Code link, but leaves out the ending parenthesis. In fact, their final BB Code generally looks like thisp  precode[url]httpwww.mywebsite.orgGeorgeClooneyactor[url] codepre  pWhich is unfortunate, because members dont usually catch it, and then the link sends them to a page that doesnt exist atp  pwww.mywebsite.orgGeorgeClooneyactorp  pstrongMy Questionstrongp  pIs it possible, hopefully through a rewrite rule, to add the closing parenthesis if an unclosed opening parenthesis is detectedp  pTo help, our wiki follows a pretty strict naming format, and I dont foresee any situation where wed have an article that has an opening parenthesis without a closing parenthesis. In all cases the words in the parentheses are located at the end of the article name. Our article naming convention is always eitherp  pArticleName or ArticleNametypep  pSo, if we get a bad link that tries to visit www.mywebsite.orgGeorgeClooneyactor, Id like to automatically redirect them to www.mywebsite.orgGeorgeClooneyactor.p  pOther possible routes Ive considered is coding an article suggestion section of the 404 page. I feel this will be a bit more work, but will be my goto solution if this htaccess plan doesnt work out.p  pHeres what I currently have for my .htaccess filep  precodeRewriteEngine On Options FollowSymLinks   Require Subdomain RewriteCond HTTPHOST mywebsite.org [NC] RewriteRule . httpwww.mywebsite.org1 [L,R301]   Pretty URL RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . DOCUMENTROOTindex.php [PT,L,QSA] codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. htaccess, and the combination of the right regex, is still pretty new and magical to me.p

Negative 34469 pThrough various resources I found that you can create custom descriptions and even custom object summaries in LLDB. Im also aware that I can do Add Expression in order to display the value of a property for a Apple framework class that the debugger hides from us. p  pstrongWhat I want is to display the framework class object as if the source code were available for it.strongp  pA picture says more than words ... what I have so farp  hr  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1UmF8.png altenter image description herep  hr  pAs you can see I have a codeSKLabelNodecode named codelabelcode in scope. I managed to add a custom summary string these are words next to codeSKNodecode via Phython scripting following the tutorials a hrefhttpstavash.wordpress.com20130106advancedissuescreatingcustomlldbobjectsummaries relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16856353howtoshowobjectivecdescriptioninxcodeherea.p  pI can also see the codelabel.fontNamecode and codelabel.textcode but thats only because I rightclicked and did Add Expression manually for each property.p  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  ol lipIs it possible and if so how to add an objects properties to its tree view via Python LLDB scripts What I want is the codelabelcode object to expand and then always display its codefontNamecode, codetextcode a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationSpriteKitReferenceSKLabelNodeRefReferenceReference.html relnofollowand other propertiesa like I have done by manually adding the expressions. Or in other words it ought to behave as if full source code were available for that class.pli lipAlternatively Is there a way to run Add Expression from the script so that I can create an alias that will quickly add multiple expressions Perhaps one where I can add the object in question as a reference, for example codecommand addCustomExpressionsWithObject labelcode.pli ol  pI accept alternative solutions as well. For example if I could write proxy classes for each SKNode class and somehow get LLDB to display the contents of a nodes corresponding proxy class, that would also work. Whatever gets the job done, and preferably in a way thats automated once implemented.p  hr  pIn general, how hard can it be to have the LLDB debugger display the documented properties of a class from an Apple framework p  pIn particular for Sprite Kit we get no info on any SKNode object whatsoever and I cant believe this hasnt bugged other developers using other Apple frameworks as hard as it bugs me. I hope theres a way to fix this but the little info I can find makes me think its either not possible or Im insane for wanting to see more details about Apple class objects.p  pstrongPSstrong Yes, Ive also looked into and customized Xcode 5.1s strongQuickLookstrong functionality. I created a a hrefhttpsgithub.comKoboldKitSpriteKitQuickLook relnofollowSpriteKitQuickLook repository with QuickLookdebugDescriptionsa for some Sprite Kit classes but its still not satisfactory as it serves only as a full class dump better than nothing though.p

To avoid doing this when I DO run the template, I would amendwrite the template so that if the file already exists in the codeMetaDatacode directory, the template skips that entity and a new MetaData file is not created to overwrite the existing one.p  pI have seen stuff for Model First and Database First, but not code first.

But the condition is that the image NEEDS to contain the thumbnail WITHIN. p  pMy Question is How can I create a thumbnail INSIDE the image when I save the image to SD card so that codeExifInterface.getThumbnailcode detects that thumb and does not return codenullcodep

Negative 34469 pI am working in an embedded Linux environment debugging a highly timing sensitive issue related to the pairingbinding of Zigbee devices. p  pOur architecture is such that data read from Zigbee Front End Module via SPI interface and then passed from Kernel space to user space for processing. The processed data and response is then passed back to kernel space and clocked out over the SPI interface again.p  pThe Zigbee 802.15.4 timing requirements specifies that we need to respond within 19.5ms and we frequently have situations where we respond just outside of this window which results in a failure and packet loss on the network.p  pThe Linux kernel is not running with preemption enabled and it may not be possible to enable preemption either.br My suspicion is that since the kernel is not preemptible there is another taskprocess which is using the ioctl interface and this holds off the Zigbee application just long enough that the 19.5ms window is exceeded. p  pI have tried the following tools p  ul lioprofile  not much help here since it profiles the entire system and the application is not actually very busy during this time since it moves such small amounts of datali listrace  too much overhead, I dont have much experience using it though so maybe the output can be refined. The overhead affects the performance so much that the application does not funciton at allli ul  pAre there any other lightweight methods of profiling a system like thisp  pIs there anyway to catch when an ioctl call is pended on another taskthread assuming this is the root cause of the issuep

Negative 34469 pI am dealing with a problem calling a stored procedure contained in a package from VB6.  p  pFirst, as a test of my implementation, I created a standalone stored procedure.

Negative 34469 pEdit this is for EFv4p  pI am trying to use an Entity Data Model, but allow the user to select the database.  We have three tables which have the same data types and relationships between different databases.  Two tables which are linked manytomany by a crossreference table.  I want to create a simple program in C that allows the user to view and edit the data, and the user must be able to select from different databases which have those tables.p  pI have created an EDM with the wizard based on one of these databases, but its tied directly to that database, and for the life of me, I dont see a way to programmatically change it.  There is an option to pass a connection string to the entity objects constructor, but it just hangs when I do.  Every search Ive tried has only brought answers to how to change the data source that gets built into the software, rather than setting it based on user choice.p  pEven if I keep hacking and manage to make this work, I feel that it is clearly not the way it was designed to work, or I would have found the answer in the few hours of searching and hacking Ive already tried.  Can someone steer me in the right direction  Basically, I want to bind my form controls to some code that represents the rules of the schema, and my understanding was that EF is the forwardlooking way to do that.  I just dont get why it wouldnt be an option to allow the user to select the data source.p

Negative 34469 pI recently spent 2 days digging Google and SO. Nothing...p  pWhat I am trying to do is very simple.p  pI have 2 models Product and Supplier. On the product create form I have fields to assign it to existing suppliers.

Negative 34469 pIve been playing with Java 8 lambda expressions for a month and Im pretty happy with everything it can do. I especially like the abstraction of streams to iterate over a collection of elements more efficiently and with less code. p  pNow one thing Im trying to figure out is abstracting a text file or SQL query of records into a stream of some sorts while still allowing it to be buffered. I already have tried to implement the Stream interface and got overwhelmed by the abstract methods. p  pId paste my work in progress but so far it all has fallen flat, and my research is coming up nil too. Can someone show an example of how to turn a CSV using a BufferedReader into a stream for each line All while maintaining the buffered nature Id also like it to support parallel too. This way, for every record that is buffered, it can be passed to a series of higher order functions in parallel.p

Negative 34469 pI am trying to choose a tool to work with for JAVASCRIPT automation tests. Until now i used Selenium Webdriver JAVA language with testng to build my tests, but for a specific reason i have been asked to search for JAVASCRIPT solution to write tests. Of course first thing on my mind was to move to WebdriverJS  it should be similar to my JAVA tests, but then i also found framework called webdriver.io , it should be better but i could not find anything that could be done with webdriver.io that is impossible with webdriverjs. Please help me to understand the difference so i can choose the right framework for me.p

Negative 34469 pIve built my 4 inch screen and 3.5 inch screen apps in Xcode 5.1.1. Yesterday I downloaded Xcode 6.1 to build those same apps for iPhone 6 and 6. Im not using auto layout because it messes with my UIImageViews and to use size classes you must also use auto layout. So I cant use size classes either. When I use that 1 storyboard for  4.7inch and 5.5 inch iPhone storyboards that are in Assistant Editor, i want to move an image in only 4.7 inch but instead the image moves in both 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch iPhones.

Negative 34469 pstrongMy overall goal is to be able to display all Customer Information in my CustomerControllerDetails View and have no idea how to pass all of this datastrongbr Customer info  fields directly in Customer table Customer contactsbr Customer locationsbr Customer documents  p  pI am able to display the customer info just fine because I am doing something like this and passing it to my viewp  precodepublic ActionResult Detailsint id      Model.Customer customer  custService.GetCustByIDid     return Viewcustomer  codepre  pI have absolutely no idea how to go from just this which gives me access to direct Customer properties in my view to displaying all of these other lists of related customer items that come from separate tables.p  pstrongHere are a few details on my project setupstrong I am using EF6DbFirst and I also create a Dto for each one of my entities and use AutoMapper to map everything. My Customer.cs model has all of the customers direct properties and also a couple that look like this for the things that are onetomany relationshipsp  precodepublic ListltCustomerContactgt Contacts  get set  codepre  pNow in my AutoMapper config I did the following since my table is named CustomerContacts in EFp  precode    CreateMapltCustomer, Model.Customergt         .ForMemberdest gt dest.Contacts, opt gt opt.MapFromsrc gt src.CustomerContact      CreateMapltCustomerGetAllResult, Model.Customergt codepre  pI am not sure if this is the proper way to do this with AutoMapper or if there is anything else I have to tell it when accessing other tables. I am thinking the only reason I have to map this property is because I want to change the name to just c.Contacts rather than c.CustomerContacts.p  pstrongSide questionstrong As you can see I am also trying to map values that come from my GetAll stored procedure which my custService.GetAll uses in my controller to bind a grid of customers. I dont think this matters in this case but I am assuming if I ever need to loop through that list that comes from the proc and get the contacts for each customer they will not be available since my stored proc only returns direct customer properties which is why I cant do the mapping for that one. Is there any workaround for thisp

Negative 34469 pWas debating with a colleague of mine tonight on methods vs attributes in Rails.  I swear I have seen this before unless I am crazy.  Here is an examplep  pWe have a user model and we want to be certain we have a first name and a last name prior to saving the record.  I hate callbacks, but for this example, lets say it is in a beforesave callback.  p  precodeclass User        beforesave setfirstlast    def setfirstlast     firstname if self.firstname.blank     lastname if self.lastname.blank   end    def firstname     self.firstname  self.name.split .first   end    def lastname     self.lastname  self.name.split .last   end end codepre  pSo, I am curious if the method setfirstlast name is called and it sees that the attribute firstname on user is blank it will call the method firstname, correct  The attribute firstname on user is different than a method called firstname.  So an attribute on the user object called firstname would be different than a method on the user class called firstname in Rails, correct  This would be like a class level method vs an instance method   Just want to be sure I am correct and that I am explaining this correctly.p  pthanksp  pMikep

Negative 34469 pIm using Auto layout with Size classes enabled.br I want to fetch data as soon as possible and it works fine doing this inp  precodeoverride func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad     fetchData  codepre  pThe problem is that the frame is not yet calculated and gives a frame of i.e 600x600 which is the canvas size in storyboard. This means that if I want to place a custom loader in the center by usingp  precodeself.loader.center  self.view.center codepre  pThis will make the loader be place someplace far away from the center. br I can fix the loader placement by calling fetchData inp  precodeoverride func viewDidAppearanimated Bool      super.viewDidAppearanimated     fetchData  codepre  pBut this makes it fetch more than only one time.  So my question is When should I fetchData, I want it to happen as early as possible. Only one time, and I want to loader to be centered.p  pThanksp  pEdit Disabling Auto Layout or Size classes is not an option.p

If day is above 30, then it convert day to 30. If month is above 12 then it convert month to 12. Similarly if day or month is below 1 then it converts them to 1. Finally it ensures that the years are between 2000 and 2015. If all inputs are valid then it returns true else it returns false. Write a program that prompts user to input day, month and year. The program then validates them using the function written above and displays validate if all the input are valid. Otherwise the program displays invalid and the corrected values of input returned by the function. Use pass by reference method.p

Negative 34469 pI have two models in my django app, codeSchedulecode, and codeTopiccode. codeTopiccode models have a codeForeignKeycode to codeSchedulecode and use the codeorderwithrespecttocode Meta attribute to keep all the Topics for a given Schedule in a particular order.p  pNow I want to be able to insert a new codeTopiccode into the codeSchedulecode at an arbitrary location in the list. I know I can use codeSchedule.gettopicordercode and codeSchedule.settopicordercode to reorder the sequence as a whole, but this causes a race condition. What if I get the order and rearrange it, then another codeTopiccode is inserted before I can call codesettopicordercodep  pIs there another simple way to maintain a sequence of related modelsp

Negative 34469 pI have a 3tab tabbed application, that is a PostComment style app.p  pThe 2nd tab is the Main Post feedview. You see Posts from all users in the application.p  pThe 1st tab is an Account view. It has relevant things related to you and your account. 1 of those being... My Posts, which the user can tap to get a list of all their posts reverse chronologically.p  pNow I have a separate storyboard PDVC.storyboard, with a view on it called PostDetailViewController. Its the viewController that shows a post in all of its detail.p  pIf the user is on the 2nd tab main Post view, and clicks a post, PostDetailViewController on PDVC.storyboard is called.p  pIf the user is on the 1st tab Account view, and clicks on one of his posts, PostDetailViewController on PDVC.storyboard is called.p  pNow, Im trying to handle push notifications when the app is inactive or in the background. The Push Notification sends along a postid. If the user taps the notification, I want them to be taken to the PostDetailViewController so they can see the post they made and the new comment that was just added. THEN, if they back out using the NavigationController, I want them to be in My Posts, the section off the 1st tab.p  pHow can I do this Do I need to make the ViewController on both the 1st AND 2nd tab storyboards, as opposed to making the view in its own storyboard Do I need to duplicate the class, one for each view on both storyboards, or can both of these ViewControllers across the 2 storyboards use the same classp

Negative 34469 pI need a simple way to call a specific method of all fields of a certain type within a class. Applies to CUnity3Dp  pExamplep  precodepublic class Item     public void Update          ....   public class Container     Item a  new Item     Item b  new Item     Item c  new Itemetc      public void UpdateAllItemslt calls Update for a, b, c  codepre  pRestrictions  p  ol licodeItemcodes should not explicitly store any reference to codeContainercode. It should not require codeContainercode as a constructor parameter.li licodeItemcodes should be normal fieldsvariables. meaning that replacing them with an array or even a hash is not a good idea. Making a property for each item also isnt a good idea.li liIf I decide to add more codeItemcodes or remove some of them, I should not need to modify my code anywhere. So, codea.Update b.Updatecode is not a solution. codemagicInternalContainer.Adda ... foreachvar item in magicInternalContaiercode also is not suitable.li licodeItemcodes should not derive from codeMonoBehaviorcode or codeComponentcode. It is a lightweight object.li ol  pAdditional info  p  ol liThe type of codeItemcode is known and will not change they do not have any virtual methods.li liExpected complexity at runtime 10200 codeContainercode objects, with 1020 codeItemcodes each, 3060 calls to codeUpdateAllItemscode per second, most likely in a single thread.li liItem is very lightweight. The contents of the class are a few floats  it easily couldve been a struct.li licodeItemcodes are not going to be dynamically added or removed at runtime.li ol  pAdvice It looks like codeType.GetFieldscode is the way to go, but it seems that this uses reflection and people keep warning that Reflection is slow pretty much everywhere. Alternatively I would need to replace the variables with codeHashSetcode, add a couple of wrappers and address the items using some codeEnumcode ids and Ill need to babysit unity serialization in this case, because unity does not serialize generics without additional help. p  pWhats the proper way to do itp

I understand how to write the code without recursion. Its just a matter of for loops and cout statements but I cant figure out how to use recursion. For the simplest case, which would be a 1dimensional array, wed write out the code but for the second simplest case we have to use recursion which will then work for the next 3rd and 4th etc cases.p

Negative 34469 pIm writing a PowerShell script to convert folder names to short names in the PATH environment variable and save the changes.  It works correctly for explicit paths, but it expands tokens, so when I save my changes the tokens are replaced with explicit paths.  Id like to preserve the tokens.p  pFor example, if my PATH is this codeSystemRootSystemRootsystem32CProgram FilesTortoiseSVNbinCProgramDatachocolateybincodep  pI want this result codeSystemRootSystemRootsystem32CPROGRA1TORTOI1binCPROGRA3CHOCOL1bincodep  pBut instead I get this codeCWindowsCWindowssystem32CPROGRA1TORTOI1binCPROGRA3CHOCOL1bincodep  pHeres the full script that illustrates the problem.p  precode get the current path.  I ended up not using either of these approaches because they appear to  be contextual on my system, at least, they include paths that arent  seen when I view the PATH value from the System Properties gt Environment  Variables dialog box. currentpath  envPath currentpath  [System.Environment]GetEnvironmentVariablePath   Instead, I get the PATH value directly from the registry, like so currentpath  GetItemProperty Path HKLMSYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlSession ManagerEnvironment Name Path.Path   The problem is that PowerShell expands the tokens even when reading from the   registry, so I cant detect the tokens and ignore them.  What I really want  is just the literal string value, with no token evaluation.  Heres a sample value this is what I see in regedt32 and the system dialogs,  but its not what I get from the line above. currentpath  SystemRootSystemRootsystem32CProgram FilesTortoiseSVNbinCProgramDatachocolateybin  newpath     the FileSystemObject has a method to convert the path using short names for the folders. fso  NewObject ComObject Scripting.FileSystemObject   Individual paths are delimited by a semicolon.  Skip paths with tokens,   and preserve trailing slashes in each path. currentpath.Split      ForEachObject           if .StartsWith                        elseif .EndsWith              fso.GetFolder.ShortPath          else              fso.GetFolder.ShortPath             ForEachObject  newpath      remove the extra semicolon from the end the new PATH. newpath  newpath.TrimEnd  Current PATH length currentpath.Length New PATH length newpath.Length  newpath   commented out so you dont accidentally update your path if you try out this script [System.Environment]SetEnvironmentVariablePath, newpath, Machine codepre  pIt seems like it should be easy enough if I could just get the literal string value from the registry, but I so far have not been able to figure out how to do that.p

Negative 34469 pI have implemented an Oracle database. I use Qt for the GUI of my application and as an interface for the db. Setting up the connection to my db and displaying tables in a QTableView works fine. Edit of all cells is generally natively supported using QSqlTableModel. However, Qt does not seem to consider any constraints defined by the database when the associated default ItemDelegate edits a cell.p  pSay I edit a cell which is a foreign key value, not only does Qt let me enter none key values, but submitting these changes queries the db to perform an update. This obviously will not work, due to set constraints. Now, I get how it might be a bit too much to ask, to expect the default ItemDelegate for my view to check for valid values on edit.p  pThe real problem occurs when I submit an unsupported value. The view still applies the value change, suggesting the edit is valid. No error is handled, nor is an error message delivered. From there on the view will not allow edits on some rows, until I revert the change to value that obeys my constraints.p  pI find it hard to believe, that I would have to setup my own itemDelegate, to validate value changes against constraints in the db.p  pSince I expect whoever is able to answer this post, knows how to set up the connection, Ill brake down the code a bitp  precodebool driverSuccess  validDriverdriver ifdriverSuccess      db  QSqlDatabaseaddDatabasedriver     db.setHostNamehost     db.setDatabaseNamedbName     db.setPortport     db.setUserNameuser     db.setPasswordpwd      db.open     ... validate connection    setup table model and connect to view QSqlRelationalTableModel model  new QSqlRelationalTableModel modelgtsetTabletableName modelgtselect  QTableView tableview  new QTableView0 tableviewgtsetModelmodel  ... db.close codepre  pId appreciate any help.

Every time I use the setHeight method it makes the TextView invisible.p  pCode p  precode public class AnalysisPage extends Activity   Button savebutton,cancelbutton EditText

Negative 34469 pTwo months ago my provisioning profile with name ASD expired uuid 7f3.... I renew this ASD provisioning profile, change this provisioning profile on XCode target settings new uuid 242... and push app version 2 to app store. Two days ago I was preparing build with app version 3 and also I sent app to review without any problems. Today I saw that by mistake during branch switching I restore target settings and I used during sending app version 3 to AppStore this old provisioning profile which expired uuid 7f3.... Strange for me is that there wasnt any problems to send app to AppStore. Now I am afraid if Apple can reject app due to this fact. Of course I can create build one more time with provisioning profile with uuid 242... but I will lost two days of waiting to review.p  pThis old provisioning profile with uuid 7f3... hasnt got name in XCode. Only identifier is visible in XCode settings.p

Negative 34469 pI struggle a lot of time regarding this problem now and asked already in another forum, which helped to approach to the solution but finally I didnt achieve it.p  pI simply need to gather information about hosts inside clouds here in our company with the help of a powershell script. You can reach the clouds via a jumphost from the local network, the jumphost is a part of the cloud as well. Then from the jumphost you can reach all cloudhosts. So I have tried this with 2 pssessions and used invokecommand same password for jumphost and cloudhostp  precodecred  GetCredential adusername Message Please insert the password for the jumphost and the cloudhost  session  NewPSSession ComputerName jumphost Credential cred  cldhost  ReadHost Please insert the name of the cloudhost  script       Param          Credential,         cloudhost          ses  NewPSSession ComputerName cloudhost Credential Credential     InvokeCommand Session ses ScriptBlock  GetChildItem C      RemovePSSession ses   InvokeCommand Session session ScriptBlock script ArgumentList cred, cldhost RemovePSSession session codepre  pBut this always gives me the output of C of the jumphost and not of the cloudhost.p  pIn the other forum I was advised to use credssp or delegated sessions. CredSSP is not possible here, because I get the error that the SPN is missing in the ADaccount and Im not allowed to add one and the delegated sessions dont help me, because I have admin rights on the jumphost and the cloudhost and dont need to delegate something.p  pBut anyway I think its not a problem of the credentials, because I get no Access denied error or something else and enterpssession to the jumphost and from there invokecommand to the cloudhost works without a problem, but I cant use this in a script. Something seems to be wrong in the logic of the nested pssessions code...p  pDo you have any idea to make this work proper herep  pdelegated admin rights a hrefhttpblogs.technet.combheyscriptingguyarchive20140403usedelegatedadministrationandproxyfunctions.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.technet.combheyscriptingguyarchive20140403usedelegatedadministrationandproxyfunctions.aspxap  pCredSSP a hrefhttpblogs.technet.combheyscriptingguyarchive20121114enablepowershellquotsecondhopquotfunctionalitywithcredssp.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.technet.combheyscriptingguyarchive20121114enablepowershellquotsecondhopquotfunctionalitywithcredssp.aspxap  pThanks a lot, Marcp  pBy the way Ive tried to use CredSSP, because it is recommend to use it for second hopsp  precodeEnableWSManCredSSP Role Client DelegateComputer jumphost Force  cred  GetCredential adusername Message Please insert the password for the jumphost and the cloudhost session  NewPSSession ComputerName jumphost Credential cred InvokeCommand Session session ScriptBlock EnableWSManCredSSP Role Server Force SetItem wsmanlocalhostclienttrustedhosts value localcomputer Force RestartService winrm Force  session2  newPSSession ComputerName jumphost Credential cred Authentication Credssp codepre  pAfter entering this last command I get the following errorp  precodeThe WinRM client cannot  process the request.

If you find  this event, you can manually create the SPN using setspn.exe .  If the SPN exists, but CredSSP cannot use Kerberos to validate  the identity of the target computer and you still want to allow the delegation of the user credentials to the target computer,  use gpedit.msc and look at the following policy Computer Configuration gt Administrative Templates gt System gt Credentials  Delegation gt Allow Fresh Credentials with NTLMonly Server Authentication.

Negative 34469 pI have a java web application that I am internationalizing currently adding 1 language. I have a pretty large amount of languagesensitive content in the database mainly descriptions. p  pOnce I internationalize my database tables, I was wondering what the best method would be for changing my DB accessing methods.p  pCurrently, I have static methods accessing my database. If I am going to add another language then one option would be to add another parameter to each data accessing method that accesses languagesensitive data. This would require making a decent amount of changes to my code so I was wondering if there are any other options.p  pAny way to access a session attribute from a java class This way I can get the userspecific locale from the session and write it right into the query without changing each DB methods signature.p  pAny suggestions Thanks.p
Negative 34469 pThere is a certain library I use in my project. This library has an interface which has about 15 methods.p  pThe purpose of this interface is to make it possible to subscribe for some events that are generated in the library. A listener class in application can implement this interface and register itself as a listener in the library to receive events.p  pAll the methods in this interface are actually events. There can be listeners who only need to receive only one or two events from many events in the interface. Even though a listener is only interested in few events, listener has to implement all the methods when extending the interface.p  pSo I asked the developer of this library to add empty default implementations to the methods in the interface.p  pBut the library developer refuses to add default implementations, stating that it would violate java best practices and using default implementations in interface methods go against the purpose of interfaces.p  pBut, as I can understand, a method in this interface does not specify some action which an implementer of this interface should be capable of. A method in this interface rather defines an event which an implementer may be interested in. So I cant see a clear reason for not adding default implementations.p  pSo, is adding default implementations to this interface break the java best practicesp
