Positive 4898 pIm needing some explanation for an assignement. p  pIm modeling a ontology for restaurants. The classes relevant to this question are codedishescode and codeRestaurantcode. p  pThe class codedishescode contain subclasses with the sort of dishes they serve. So for example codeclassdishes has subclassitaliancode. To the subclass codeitaliancode Ive added instances like codespaghetticode. p  pThe class restaurant contains mostly subclasses with necessary and sufficient restrictions to describe the type of restaurants based on the dishes they serve. But before a restaurant can get categorised Ive got create instances with named restaurants. Take for example instancepizzaFreddi which is linked to the instance pizza through a property hasDish. Because the instance Pizza belongs to italian the restriction on one of the defined subclasses of restaurant with ItalianDishes infers this instance. This one works, Ive used a some restriction. But what I want to do is also create a defined subclass that infers instancesnamedRestaurants that have for example more than one location. The instance codePizzaFreddicode for example is linked with a property isLocatedIn to the city codeAmsterdamcode and codeDen Haagcode. Ive made a restriction that says isLocatedIn min 2 City. But this does not seem to infer the instance codePizzaFreddicode. Whats going wrongp  pIve added screenshots for explanation. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com8sYNV.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com8sYNV.pnga a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comz8rT6.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comz8rT6.pngap
Positive 4898 pI am creating a user control which contains 2 ListView controls. I want the user to be able to use Designer to set the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controlsbasically, the Columns property for the user control and the 2 ListView controls are to be synced to each other, using the exact same ColumnHeader collections.p  pFor the user control itself, in order for the Columns property to work properly as a collection of column headers, I find I must inherit from System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection. I set the collection class to Serializable and the class property to DesignerSerializationVisibilityDesignerSerializationVisibility.Content. When I do this, and use the user control on a form and add columns to the Columns property, I find in the forms Designer in InitializeComponents that the Add method of the collection class is used to add the ColumnHeader variables created. This works.p  pWhat I have trouble doing, however, is syncing the Columns collection property with the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls. For the inherited collection class inherited from Collection, I cannot override the Add method, so I cant set the Add method to also add the ColumnHeader to the Columns properties of the 2 Listview controls.p  pHow do I assure that the Columns properties of the 2 ListView controls always change to match changes in the user controls Columns propertyp

Positive 4898 pIm using an MVP pattern to expose field values from my View to my Presenter. Id like to add an codeErrorProvidercode to my View and add the errors from the Presenter, but that would mean exposing my controls, which Im not keen on doing. My solution involved creating an codeExposableControlValuecode class that exposes a value generically and has the added function codeCreateErrorstring errorMessagecode. p  precodepublic interface IExposableControlValueltTgt     T Value  get set     void CreateErrorstring errorMessage    void ClearErrors   codepre  pMy thought was, Ill pass in the codePropertycode by reference and now my generic value will essentially point to the codeControlcodes backing field. All the codeErrorProvidercode logic could be handled View side and all of the error checking could be handled by the presenter. p  pObviously, Im here because you cant pass the codePropertycode by reference, and all of the examples Ive seen arent close enough to my situation that I can decipher them for this example. p  pId also be fine with setting codeT Getcode , codeSetT valuecodemethods dynamically if there is a way to do that, but in short, Id like to mimic having that Property live inside of my class instance.p

Positive 4898 pIn our NodeJS application, we define custom error classes by extending the default Error objectp  precodeuse strict const util  requireutil  function CustomErrormessage      Error.callthis     Error.captureStackTracethis, CustomError     this.message  message   util.inheritsCustomError, Error codepre  pThis allows us to codethrow CustomErrorSomethingcode with the stack trace showing up correctly, and both codeinstanceof Errorcode and codeinstanceof CustomErrorcode working correctly.p  pHowever, for returning errors in our API over HTTP, we want to convert the error to JSON. Calling codeJSON.stringifycode on an Error results in codecode, which is obviously not really descriptive for the consumer.p  pTo fix this, I thought of overriding codeCustomError.prototype.toJSONcode, to return an object literal with the error name and message. codeJSON.stringifycode would then just stringify this object and all would work greatp  precode after util.inherits call  CustomError.prototype.toJSON   gt      name     CustomError,     message  this.message  codepre  pHowever, I quickly saw that this throws a codeTypeError Cannot assign to read only property toJSON of Errorcode. Which might make sense as Im trying to write to the prototype. So I changed the constructor insteadp  precodefunction CustomErrormessage      Error.callthis     Error.captureStackTracethis, CustomError     this.message  message     this.toJSON   gt          name     CustomError,         message  this.message       codepre  pThis way I expected, the CustomError.toJSON function would be used and the CustomError.prototype.toJSON from Error would be ignored.p  pUnfortunately, this just throws the error upon object construction codeCannot assign to read only property toJSON of CustomErrorcode.p  pNext I tried removing codeuse strictcode from the file, which emsort ofem solved the problem in that no error was being thrown anymore, although the codetoJSONcode function was not used by codeJSON.stringifycode at all.p  pAt this point Im just desperate and just try random things. Eventually I end up with using codeObject.definePropertycode instead of directly assigning to codethis.toJSONcodep  precodefunction CustomErrormessage      Error.callthis     Error.captureStackTracethis, CustomError     this.message  message     Object.definePropertythis, toJSON,          value  gt              name     CustomError,             message  this.message               codepre  pThis works perfectly. In strict mode, no errors are being called, and codeJSON.stringifycode returns codename CustomError, message Somethingcode like I want it to.p  pSo although it works as I want it to now, I still want to knowp  ol liWhy does this work exactly I expect it to be the equivalent to codethis.toJSON  ...code but apparently it is not.li liShould it work like this I.e. is it safe to depend on this behaviourli liIf not, how should I override the toJSON method correctly if possible at allli ol
Positive 4898 pThis surely is a common problem. I have a properties file like codemysettings.propertiescode which is read by an application class. When I write a test class, it needs to test different scenarios of things that could be present in codemysettings.propertiescode in order to ensure maximum code coverage e.g. empty properties file, basic properties file etc. But I can only have one codemysettings.propertiescode in my codesrctestresourcescode.p  pWhat would be really great is if there was just some annotationp  pcodeMockFileOnClassPathuse  mysettingsbasic.properties, insteadOf  mysettings.propertiescodep  pThen I could just have multiple codemysettingsXXX.propertiescode files in my codesrctestresourcescode and just annotated the correct one on each test method. But I cant find anything like this. Im using JUnit 4.12.p  pI can think of a couple of crude solutionsp  ol liBefore each test, find the file on the file system, copy it using filesystem IO, then delete it again after the test. But this is clumsy and involves a lot of redundancy. Not to mention Im not even sure whether the classpath directory will be writable.li liUse a mocking framework to mock codegetResourcecode. No idea how I would even do that, especially as there are a million different ways to get the file codethis.getClass.getResourceAsStream...code, codeMyClass.class.getResourceAsStream...code, codeClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader.getResourceAsStream...code etc.li ol  pI just think this must be a common problem and maybe there is already a solution in JUnit, Mockito, PowerMock, EasyMock or something like thatp  pstrongEDITstrong Someone has specified that this question is a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24231773specifyingacustomlog4jpropertiesfileforallofjunittestsrunfromeclipsSpecifying a custom log4j.properties file for all of JUnit tests run from Eclipsea but it isnt.

So I want a collection of those fieldsproperties. Something likep  precodeforeach fieldReference in ExampleClass.fieldReferenceCollection     readValueFromFilefieldReference   codepre  pBut how do I make one while keeping all the namesp  pMaking a collection with all the parameters values instead of separate fields seems logical, but field names would be lost then. And, given the number of fields, wed like to keep those names if possible to simplify further development.p  pSo I need separate fieldsproperties AND a collection of them to be available at the same time.p  pDictionary collection is not exactly fast, afaik, so parameter names as keys for values doesnt seem exactly fitting too.p  pAnother option I found is reflection, but Im not yet sure how the order of fields in reflected collection is determined. Order of fields is very important as the file, Im reading values from, has no metadata, just a sequence of hex values. Also reflection seems to be overkill for reading values from a file, and it is slow too, afaik.p  pSo the question is what should I do in order to have class fields and a collection of them at the same timep  pAre my assumptions wrong about this task Is there any other approach to reading a lot of dumb values from a file into a complex objectp  pP.S. My first SO question and English is my very second language, so Im sorry for the mistakes.p

Negative 4898 pI have a question regarding the integration of business objects developed using Linq To Sql for data query and integrating with Sql Server Reporting Services.p  pWe have a set of business objects that query a couple of back end databases that is developed with Linq to SQL. The SQL that gets generated is relatively dynamic based on the conditions the user selects and involves multiple joins, some inner, some outer, etc.  Linq to SQL worked great for this.  However, we ran into issues when we tried to implement reports with SQL Reporting Services after the initial roll out.  We didnt have the ability to bind the SSRS reports to our business layer.  What we essentially ended up doing is getting the SQL that is executed from SQL Profiler and creating stored procedures, and using the stored procedures in the reports.  As one can imagine, this became a problem as we maintained the code, needing to update both our business layer and the stored procedure.p  pI have done some looking and I see that Custom Data Extensions appear to be an approach to do this. Is this the solution to the problem Does anyone have a better approach Are there any example of implementing a solution like this using LINQp  pa hrefhttpwww.devx.comdbzoneArticle31336 relnofollowhttpwww.devx.comdbzoneArticle31336ap  pThanksp

The reason I ask this was I have been for the past year or so been storing hundreds of thousands, more like millions of 2k txt and xml documents.

The problem results from the fact that UserControl code namely the Initialize, ReadProperties, Resize, and WriteProperties events can execute at unexpected times.  If the code in these events relies on other code to initialize any of its data structures, theres a good chance its going to fail because that initialization code may not have executed.

Negative 4898 pIve been trying all night, and talk of maps, arrays, vectors and hashmaps have filled my head. im just confused now. i posted a previous question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1687085cmapreallyslowhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1687085cmapreallyslowap  pproblem was fixed but it seems maps are still not fast enough. i need to keep adding data. data is added ALOT during run time. i got it all working now, and if i add 1 piece of data per step per frame in the game it works fine. but once i do 2 at a time, i see performance drops. i looked into this hash stuff but couldnt find alot on it. just an fyi, the number of items stores will probably never exceed 2000 or so. so i guess it is fairly small scaled..p  pwhat im trying to store, as someone else put it, is this object with id 101 has a value of 4 for setting 1 or information[101][1]  4 except that i just keep getting more and more objects differet ids, which is the key value added into the system with different settings 2nd key.  i dont know what the size of the array will be thats why i didnt use arrays. looked into vectors but that confused the hell out of me. ltp  pright now i havep  precodedeclared as a class member mapltdouble,  mapltint, doublegt gt objIdMap   lower down the page, in some function mapltint, doublegt objSettingsMap objSettingsMap[0]  value objSettingsMap[1]  value objSettingsMap[2]  value objSettingsMap[3]  value objIdMap[id]  objSettingsMap return1 codepre  por maybe it isnt the maps is it normal for maps to perform slow like this when theyre used so heavily i havnt included it in the code above, but on every step of the game every object with an id in objIdMap is accessing it to retrieve their objSettingsMap values. though the slow downs only occur when the above is executed more than once per step..p  pso yea, what do you guys think is the best way to hold this data, and retrieve it etc please provide example  thanksp

Negative 4898 pTwo Delphi programs need to load foo.dll, which contains some code that injects a clientauth certificate into a SOAP request.  foo.dll resides in cfooappfoo.dll and is normally loaded by cfooappfoo.exe.  That works fine.  The other program needs the same functionality, but it resides in cprogram filesunwantedstepchildsadapp.exe.  Both aps load the DLL with this codep  precodeFOOLib  LoadLibraryfoo.dll  ... If FOOLib ltgt 0 then  begin   FOOProc  GetProcAddressFOOLib , xInjectCert   FOOProcmyHttpRequest, Data, CertName end codepre  pIt works great for foo.exe, as the dll is right there.  sadapp.exe fails to load the library, so FOOLib is 0, and the rest never gets called.  The sadapp.exe program therefore silently fails to inject the cert, and when we test against production, it the cert is missing, do the connection fails.  Obviously, we should have fullyqualified the path to the DLL.  Without going into a lot of details, there were aspects of the testing that masked this problem until recently, and now its basically too late to fix in code, as that would require a full regression test, and there isnt time for that. p  pSince weve painted ourselves into a corner, I need to know if there are any options that Ive overlooked.  While we cant change the code for this release, we CAN tweak the installer.  Ive found that placing cfooapp into the path works. As does adding a second copy of foo.dll directly into cprogram filesunwantedstepchild. cfooappfoo.exe will always be running while sadapp.exe is running, so I was hoping that Windows would find it that way, but apparently not. Is there a way to tell Windows that I really want that same DLL  Maybe a manifest or something  This is the sort of magic bullet that Im looking for.  I know I canp  ol liModify the windows path, probably in the installer. Thats ugly.li liAdd a second copy of the DLL, directly into the unwantedstepchild folder. Also uglyli liDelay the project while we code and test a proper fix.  Unacceptable.li liOtherli ol  pThanks for any guidance, especially with Other. I understand that this issue is not necessarily specific to Delphi.  Thanksp

Negative 4898 pIve been given the following taskp  pAn external source will write a name, datetime and value to a database table table A at random intervals. I need to copy this data to another table table B and delete the row in table A. If the name doesnt exist in a lookup table then the row needs to remain in table A until it does and then copied over to table B.p  pDoes the above sound like a situation where a database trigger could be used effectively or would it be better creating an external app maybe windows service that checks the db every 5 min and performs the necessary updatesp  pUpdatep  pThis does not necessarily need to be instant thus if I used a windows service or task scheduler it would probably be set at 5 min intervals. It being virtually instant if a trigger is used is just a bonus of using a trigger, not a deciding factor.p  pMy main concern is that is this the correct way of using a trigger Should triggers be used to copy data or is this bad practise Also could have problems with using a trigger, for example if a copy fails could it lock the table stopping subsequent rows being copied If one copy takes too long will it not process the rows that have been inserted while it was bus If I dont use a trigger is there a better solution e.g. a windows service or console app using windows schedular  p  pThanksp

Negative 4898 pIm looking for some more experienced insights into my current problem a short descriptionp  pstrongThe setup and a simplified model.strongp  pThe goal of the web application is to provide a platform for posting, searching and reacting on ads. The ads themselves fall into roughly 3 large categoriesp  ol liReal estateli liCarsli liVarious basically all otherli ol  pEach ad has some basic fields a title, a description and a reference. When talking about specific ads, there are a lot more fields. p  ol liFor strongreal estatestrong there are additional prices, number of specific rooms, facilities, certificates and such. The price can be either rent or buying price.li listrongCarsstrong have colors, horsepower, production year, etc.li listrongVariousstrong basically have a description and a price.li ol  pemIn reality, each type of ad has about 30 nonrecurring fields. I only presented basic fields to give you an idea.emp  pEach category has some subtypes, for example Real Estate can be either a house, garage or apartment. Each has its own nonrecurring fields.p  pstrongThe problems.strongp  pIm looking for a way to properly store this in a database and code an application around it, in proper OO, 3 tier style.p  pstrongFirst,strong when I think of the UI example I do not want to create a control or page for each type of Ad i want to display. Let alone searching, inputting... How would I go about handling this A base class would cause a lot of recurring caselike structures to find out to which class to cast  wouldnt it Not to mention excessive controls that are not being used when only handling one particular Ad.p  pstrongThe second problemstrong is storing this in a DB  SQL Server 2008 R2. The current version basically has one table about 250 columns with all possible values for every kind of ad. Its horrible  when adding a Car ad for example, about 50 fields are filled while 200 remain NULL. Surely there must be a better way The model however is quite extensive so Im really in the dark as to how I go about this. When looking at my BL tier, I have something like this simplified a lotp  precodepublic class Ad      public long Id  get set      public string Title  get set      public string Reference  get set    public class RealEstateAd  Ad      public string BuildingCondition  get set      public decimal ParcelSize  get set    public class CarAd  Ad      public string Color  get set      public double HorsePower  get set    public class VariousAd  Ad      public string Category  get set      public string Description  get set   codepre  pThis is not entirely correct as each RealEstateAd basically has derived classes such as HouseAd, ApartmentAd, GarageAd... Am I going to far into modeling this Should I just compromise and slam all the fields into 1 table I realize overmodeling could have a negative impact on performance lots of joins, but I cant help feeling a really good, proper model will help me out a lot when programming.p

Negative 4898 pIn my app, I have an codeNSOutlineViewcode that gets its data from a codeNSTreeControllercode  which in turn gets it from the Core Data model.p  pWhat I would like to do now is to add group headings and maybe some additional rows to the outline view  obviously things that should exist outside of the model and be part of the view.

Negative 4898 p.NET 2.0 added the codeEventHandlerltTArgsgtcode generic delegate type to simplify the process of writing custom events instead of having to define an codeEventArgscode class and its corresponding delegate e.g. codeMyEventArgscode and codeMyEventHandlercode, you need only write the args class.p  pBearing that in mind, why does this delegate type appear almost nowhere in the .NET Framework I know that most of the core APIs were developed before generics were introduced, but even in new parts of the framework like WPF, they have opted for explicitly defining delegate types e.g. codeRoutedEventHandlercode instead of codeEventHandlerltRoutedEventArgsgtcode.p  pIs there something inherently wrong with the generic event handler delegate I often make use of it and I worry that my code appears very out of place when compared to builtin classes.p

Topic Name  jmsTopicp  pScenario 1 p  pAMQ is running, L is not connected to jmsTopic in AMQ. P sends M1 to M7 to jmsTopic. If L is connected to jmsTopic at time say T8 which is greater than T7, will it receive the messages M1 to M7 or only messages that are sent to the topic after time T8. p  pScenario 2 AMQ is running, L is connected and listening to jmsTopic, P sends M1 to M4. L receives M1 to M4. In the meantime L processes M1 to M4, P sends M5 to M7, however L crashes out during processing of M4. If L again connects itself to jmsTopic , does it receive M5 to M7 or only messages that were sent after L has connected to jmsTopic will be received by L.p  pScenario 3 AMQ is running, L is connected and listening to jmsTopic, P sends M1 to M7. However AMQ crashes is L aware of AMQ status and reconnects once AMQ is up and running.p

Another student is writing the Kinect driver which will be mounted somewhere on the ceiling or the wall behind the Mac and which outputs the position of all fingers on the Macs screen.p  pIt is my responsibility to use that fingerpositions and react on them. The goal is to use one single finger to control the mouse and react on multiple fingers the very same way, like they are on the trackpad.p  pI thought that this is going to be easy and straight forward, but its not. It is actually very easy to control the mouse cursor using one finger using CGEvent, but unfortunately there is no public API for creating and posting MultitouchGestures to the system.p  pIve done a lot of research, including catching all CGEvents using an event tap at the lowest possible position and trying to disassemble them, but no real progress so far.p  pThan I stumbled over this and realized, that even the lowest position for an event tap is not deep enough a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1669909extendingfunctionalityofmagicmousedoineedakextExtending Functionality of Magic Mouse Do I Need a kextap  pWhen I got it right, the builtin Trackpad and the MagicMouse and the MagicTrackpad communicates over a KEXTKernelExtension with the private MultitouchSupportframework, which is generating and posting the incoming data in some way to the OS.p  pSo I would need to use private APIs from the MultitouchSupport.framework to do the very same thing like the Trackpad does, right Or would I need to write a KEXTExtensionp  pAnd if I need to use the MultitouchSupportframework How can I disassemble it to get the private APIs I know classdump, but that only works on ObjectiveCframeworks, which this framework is notp  pMany thanks for any response NexD.p

I know enabling optimizations and debug mode at the same time might have disadvantages likep  blockquote   pGCC allows you to use g with O. The shortcuts taken by optimized   code may occasionally produce surprising results some variables you   declared may not exist at all flow of control may briefly move where   you did not expect it some statements may not be executed because   they compute constant results or their values were already at hand   some statements may execute in different places because they were   moved out of loops.p blockquote  pSo my question is, does marchnative have similar side effects or is it sensible to use it in debug code as wellp

Negative 4898 pIve been stuck for the last 2 days trying to figure out this problem that I think is a standard occurrence for Flex developers.  Im using Flex 4.5 with PHP Zend webservice framework. Basically, I have 2 DataGrids that can drag and drop between each other.  At the initializing of the component, I call a webservice to populate the top DataGrid.  Then the user can drag rows to the bottom DataGrid that get processed and saved later on.p  pMy problem is that I want to have a reset button or cancel button, that will take the user to a new component in the ViewStack, and if they return to the component with the DataGrids, the top DataGrid has the original records and the bottom DataGrid is empty.  I just cant figure out a good way to repopulate the top DataGrid.  I can clear it, but it doesnt seem to refresh with the original data. p  pIve tried unsuccessfully to call the webservice again and set the dataprovider to the new lastResult token.  Ive also tried unsuccessfully to copy the results of the initial webservice call to an ArrayCollection and simply set a Bindable variable to that ArrayCollection or a backup of that ArrayCollection holding original records.  Does anyone have a simple solution  Thank youp  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt     ltsNavigatorContent xmlnsfxhttpns.adobe.commxml2009

Negative 4898 pMy understanding is that when you serialize an object and pass it through a session, for example, from index.php page to securePage.php, SESSION just passes that objects data, therefore, you can not use that objects functions.

Negative 4898 pIm attempting to use Pythons tarfile module to extract a tar.gz archive.p  pId like the extraction to overwrite any target files it they already exist  this is tarfiles normal behaviour.p  pHowever, Im hitting a snitch in that some of the files have writeprotection on e.g. chmod 550.p  pThe tarfile.extractall operation actually failsp  precodeIOError [Errno 13] Permission denied foobarfile codepre  pIf I try to delete the files from the normal commandline, I can do it, I just need to answer a promptp  precode rm ltfilenamegt rm ltfilenamegt override protection 550 yesno yes codepre  pThe normal GNU tar utility also handles these files effortlessly  it just overwrites them when you extract.p  pMy user is the owner of the files, so it wouldnt be hard to recursively chmod the target files before running tarfile.extractall. Or I can use shutil.rmtree to blow away the target beforehand, which is the workaround Im using now..

Negative 4898 pWe have an EPOS system that is built in VB6. A client is using Microsoft Dynamics AX as a CRM system. A 3rd party has created the AX implementation for our client and theyve exposed a set of WCF web services that we need to consume to synchronise data between the EPOS and the AX CRM. Knowing VB6 would have issues calling WCF services, I created the following components to handle the communication between the EPOS and the AX CRM.p  pVB6 EPOS which calls  br 1 VB6 DLL wrapper which calls...  br 2 .NET3.5 COM Callable Proxy DLL wrapper which calls...   br 3 .NET3.5 Web Service Handler Where the web servicesw actually get called  br Microsoft Dynamics AX CRM.p  pI built a test console app in Vb.NET to simulate calls from VB6 to help with debugging, so that test console app calls component 2.p  pWhilst doing this I was getting the following exception p  pcould not find default endpoint element that references contract X in the servicemodel client configuration section. this might be because no configuration file was found for your application, or because no endpoint element matching this contract could be found in the client element.p  pI googled around and found that I had to copy the bindings and endpoints section from Component 3s app.config to a new app.config for my Test Console app. I dont know WCF and havent got the time at the moment, to really learn it to the point where I understand why this fixed this error.p  pNow though, Im trying to call the services from the VB6 EPOS and this error is popping up again. So I added an app.config to Component 2, thinking that as Component 2 is the first .NET3.5 component in the chain, that is where the endpoint declaration should go, but No. The error is still popping up. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas Any programming heroes out there that can shed some light on this for a simpleton please Please dont ask why we dont rewrite the EPOS. We will. just not yet. Theres over 3 million lines of spaghetti code in there and Ive only been working on it for 8 months p  pAs an aside, Doesnt this scenario break one of the golden rules of OOP, i.e. encapsulation.

Negative 4898 pI have a gridview taking data from object data source. The object data source is taking data from a method which takes one parameter string. The parameter is supplied from page url using querystring, and the default value is set to null. In the method taking parameter, I am trying to check if the parameter is null return all data else return data  with id got from the parameter  eg. code.p  precodepublic listltstringgt MyMethod string param              ifparam  null             return  all          else             return  id with param           codepre  pI tried to debug the program and the param is actually null but  the if  statement is always going to false condition. i.e. param  null always evaluating to false. I tried String.IsNullorEmptyparam, and it still is evaluating to false. I dont understand what the problem is. Please help.

What am i doing wrong The onDraw method is fine because when i did this it worked finep  precodepublic GameActivity activ      activ.setContentViewthis   public void onDrawCanvas canvas      board.drawcanvas  codepre  pbut the reason why i cant do it like that anymore is because on tablets there is a bar at the bottom where the back button and the show keyboard buttons are. When i do it like this it draws under that bar and it cuts off images. If i do it like this then Android sets the bounds of the layout so that it isnt under that bar. I would prefer to do it with the xml layout anyway because I think Android works better when you use the xml layouts instead of setting your custom view to the content view.

Negative 4898 pIm trying to implement a high performance blocking queue backed by a circular buffer on top of pthreads, semaphore.h and gcc atomic builtins.  The queue needs to handle multiple simulataneous readers and writers from different threads.p  pIve isolated some sort of race condition, and Im not sure if its a faulty assumption about the behavior of some of the atomic operations and semaphores, or whether my design is fundamentally flawed.p  pIve extracted and simplified it to the below standalone example.  I would expect that this program never returns.  It does however return after a few hundred thousand iterations with corruption detected in the queue.p  pIn the below example for exposition it doesnt actually store anything, it just sets to 1 a cell that would hold the actual data, and 0 to represent an empty cell.  There is a counting semaphore vacancies representing the number of vacant cells, and another counting semaphore occupants representing the number of occupied cells.p  pWriters do the followingp  ol lidecrement vacanciesli liatomically get next head index mod queue sizeli liwrite to itli liincrement occupantsli ol  pReaders do the oppositep  ol lidecrement occupantsli liatomically get next tail index mod queue sizeli liread from itli liincrement vacanciesli ol  pI would expect that given the above, precisely one thread can be reading or writing any given cell at one time.p  pAny ideas about why it doesnt work or debugging strategies appreciated.

pedit I added sizabletrue on the listhead, now you can force a horizontal scrollbar to appear by making the column wider. Furthermore the scrollbar can only be made to appear if there are two tabs.p  pBackground I found some questions that might be going in the same direction, but a solution for my problem I didnt find. Beware that I dont want to add overflow auto to the tabpanel  that destroys the use Tabpanel for me. In fact I have an outer tabpanel around this code and would have to add the scrollbar there, which makes all tabpanels grow scrollbars... and the scrollbar isnt even on the bottom of the tabpanels space. Sorry if this is convoluted, if you layed out stuff like this you probably have an idea. Furthermore I dont want fixed sizes of course.p  pOn a sidenote shrinking the browserwindow is not shrinking the listbox  growing it is no problem. Somethings up herep  pThanksp
Negative 4898 pI am trying to include a version of Eclipse in an installation package, that has been prepopulated with plugins from an update site.p  pI can include all of Eclipses files into my installer quite easily but when I run Eclipse on the target machine, the list of update sites is lost. E.g. When I run it on my own machine and select HelpInstall new software... the Work with list contains the recently used update sites. When I run it on the target machine it is empty.p  pI have tested just copying my Eclipse folder from a network share onto the target machine and get the same results. However, when I run Eclipse directly from the network share the Work with list is populated as I would expect.p  pWhat am I missingp  pThanks, Alanp

Negative 4898 pI have one base image image1 depicting concentration of fluid in a space for time t1. For the similar result i.e. concentration of fluid in a space, I have one more image image2 for time t2 , where t2t1. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3kFxy.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe above two images are plotted in Matlab using codeimagesccode. I want to differentiate between those two images such that it is physically intuitive. However, with those two images its hard to see much difference between them with the naked eye. Although there is very minor change in concentration between image1 and image2, I would like to find what is the difference and show it so that it explains the physical meaning. To explain physically, the fluid would move down with time i.e. the concentration would increase in the bottom part as time passes.p  pFor example in the following graph even though its not physically intuitive of the above image each line represents the entire column values for corresponding image from above. Hence there are 100 blue and 100 red lines for image1 and image2, respectively.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMje57.jpg altenter image description herep  pHowever, I would like to know if there is a better method in Matlab to plot the difference in images from image1 to image2 which better explains the physical meaning of the change.

Negative 4898 pI have been using an embedded activeMQ server configuration configuration is very similar to the examples that illustrate the concept of an embedded activeMQ serverlistener.  Aas part of the application, I have a monitoring thread that monitors a directory. Instead of having to kill the process to shutdown the activeMQ server, I introduced a check for a STOP file  and if the file exists, the server would shutdown.  The shutdown I am trying to accomplish by calling the stop function on the broker.p  pbroker.stop  This seems to shutdown the service. However, Upon a System.exit, Exception errors are raised p  pI observed that one other post that mentioned similar behaviour had a response that indicated as much as This is normal behavior.  One other post indicated that I should disable the shutdownhook via Spring config of the broker by setting the useShutdownHookfalse.  This has not fixed the problem either.p  pAny help regarding this issue is appreciated.p  pThanksp  pHere is the exception stack tracep  precode171020.056 [Thread9] DEBUG

Negative 4898 pI hope you are all wellp  pA question for an app that uses Backbone.js and node.js.

So I would like to load the page and not just change the view. One way to do this I think would be to just havep  precodewindow.location  messagesid codepre  pas the last line above, but I seem to have the impression this is not good practice for Backbone in general.  Otherwise, could just create the message model inside of the render method, and then write its id directly into the href of the button when the view is rendered, but this also seems messy p  precoderender  function    var message  new Messagemodel  model   var id  message.getid   a button.attrhref, messagesid  codepre  pAny ideas on how I could set this up in a more elegant way Thanks in advancep

Negative 4898 pIm on Windows and Ive got the latest version of OS X 10.7.4 running as a virtual machine on VMware Workstation. Everything works just perfect, including the latest version of Xcode. Things are very smooth and, unlike one would imagine, theres almost no sluggish behavior. I find working on projects being pretty efficient with the combined power of all the software installed on the two operating systems, which happily communicate through the VMwares shared folder. iOS devices connect via USB to the virtual machines iTunes and Xcode just fine, like it was a real Mac. However, the names of nearly all the virtual devices of the virtual machine have a VMware in them, which makes the VM not so real in the Apples eyes if Xcode gathers and reports machine statistics during installation or app submission. In any case, even though Xcode might suspect that its in an alien environment, it hasnt shown a single sign of it so far and works totally O.K.p  pAnd, as the time of enrolling into the Apples developer program is approaching, I wonder do I really have to shrink the development budget by 10001500 or so to purchase a physical Mac as Apple would expect me to do. Its a significant amount of money and I would rather save them for something more useful. I would really like to avoid the purchase. Unfortunately, the times when people would buy Macs to lick them, as Steve Jobs famous words would suggest, are over.p  pSo, my questions arep  ol lipHas anyone heard of or maybe experienced fruitful development of iOS apps on a virtual OS X machine, which would mean getting an iOS app signing certificate to be used by Xcode running on that VM, and actually submitting an app to the App Store from the VMpli lipEven if such thing is technically possible, are there any legal obstacles buried somewhere in the license agreements I would have to agree to while enrolling into the Apples developer program Ahh, somethings telling me there are..pli ol

When I drop the mongodb collection on the machines that do not work, then use the same code to insert a new document and recreate the collection, the query begins to work again.  My question is what can cause this type of behavior  Can adding new variables to a class cause mongodb near queries to stop performing  If there are documents added to a collection with different variables than what already exist can that cause problems  In production, I can not simply drop collections to fix this.  Is there something I am missing about keeping data in mongodb collections consistent so that my spring mongodb code continues to work p  pThe mongoTemplate code p  precode    Point point  new PointlocationAsDoubleArray[0],locationAsDoubleArray[1]      NearQuery query  NearQuery.nearpoint.getX,point.getY.sphericaltrue.maxDistancemaxDistance,Metrics.MILES.distanceMultiplierMetrics.MILES.queryregularQuerymaxDistancenew Distanceradius,Metrics.MILES       GeoResultsltCalendarEventgt results  MongoOperationsmongoTemplate.geoNearquery, CalendarEvent.class codepre  pThe document that should be returned in JSON formatp  precode     class  com.eatmyfish.services.custom.CalendarEvent , id   oid  5011c5cf51527fce6c4d2a00 , keywords  [ test , search , function , test , ] , address1  221 East 5th Street , address2   , allDay  false , categories  [ 14] , city  Saint Paul , clientId  109 , clientProductId  962 , color  003666 , createUser  peterson.dean , description  test , end  20120726 140000 , endDate   date  20120726T190000.000Z , externalLink  lta hrefhttpgtMore Infoltagt , geoLocation  [ 93.0875195 , 44.9490055] , latitude  0.0 , location  221 East 5th Street  Saint Paul,MN 55101  , locationManuallyEntered  false , locationName  My Cubicle , longitude  0.0 , moreInfoLink  lta hrefhttplocalhost8080postslist3150.pagegtMore Infoltagt , note   , privateEventIn  N , restFormattedAddress  221East5thStreetSaintPaul,MN55101 , start  20120726 040000 , startDate   date  20120726T090000.000Z , state  MN , title  Test Search Function , topicId  3150 , url  httplocalhost8080postslist3150.page , zip  55101 codepre  pThe code works differently depending on the machine it is being run.

Negative 4898 pI had a question regarding identifying all the points next to a given cell or set of cells in a matrix see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq11680282918069Need a Ruby way to determine the elements of a matrix quottouchingquot another elementa.  Since no suitable ideas were put forth, I decided to proceed via brute force.p  pThe code below successfully does what I sought to do.  The array tmpl template contains a map of how to get from a given coordinate provided by atlantis to the 8 cells surrounding it.  I then construct an array sl shoreline that contains all the underwater land touching the shoreline of atlantis by summing each element of atlantis with all elements of tmpl.p  precode create method to determine elements contiguous to atlantis require matrix             atlantis  [[2,3],[3,4]] tmpl  [[1,1],[1,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,1]]  ln  0 sl  [] while ln lt atlantis.length   n  0   tsl  []   while n lt 8     tsl[n]  [atlantis[ln], tmpl[n]].transpose.map  x x.reduce      n  n 1   end   sl  sl  tsl   ln  ln  1 end sl  sl  atlantis sl.uniq sl.toa.each  r puts r.inspect  codepre  pBut I have a problem one of many remaining in that I still need 2 levels of loops above whats shown here one to keep adding land to atlantis until it reaches a set size and another to make additional islands, Bermuda, Catalina, etc. and already this is becoming difficult to read and follow.  My vague understanding of object oriented programming suggests that this cold be improved by turning some of these loops into methods.  However, I learned to program 35 years ago in basic and am struggling to learn Ruby as it is.  So my requests arep  ol lipIs in fact better to turn these into methodspli lipIf so, would anyone be willing to show me how thats done by changing something into an methodpli lipWhat do you do when you add additional levels and discover you need to change something in a lower method as a result e.g, after figuring out the simple case of how to create codeslcode with just one value in codeatlantiscode, I had to go back and rework it for longer values.pli ol  pI hoping by asking the question in this way, it becomes something also useful to other nubies.p  pBTW, this bit code.transpose.map  x x.reduce code I found on Stack Overflow after hours of trying to do it cause it should be simple and if I couldnt do it I must be missing something obvious.  Yeah, I bet you know too. lets you add two arrays element by element and I have no idea how it works.p

Negative 4898 pFirst let me say, that what I want to do is get the value of a property in a generic class that may be overriden by class that inherits from it. Think of it in the base class as a default value, that the inheritor of the class can override to set their own Default value.p  pI have tried to use reflection directly on the type, using the System.Reflection.FieldInfo.GetValue but this does not work for classes with generic types. So I think that I need to instantiate the class to be able to see what the value is.p  pThe types I have I retrieved by reading the Dlls in the bin and using Reflection to find the types that inherit from my interface.p  pI am using .NET 4.5 p  phere is documentation that seems like it explains exactly what I need to do a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryb8ytshk6.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryb8ytshk6.aspxap  pIn this documentation the only difference I can see is how we got our types, I looked in the bin for types and they simply called typeof, Since types are so complex it seems this may be a likely mismatch but I cannot see what is missingif anythingp  precodeforeach var item in types      var ts  item.GetFieldDefaultTimeToExpire     Type[] typeArguments  item.GetGenericArguments     if ts  null              var t  item.MakeGenericTypetypeArguments         var obj  Activator.CreateInstancet         var timespan  obj.DefaultTimeToExpire         subscriberInfos.Addnew Tupleltstring, Type, TimeSpangtitem.Name, item, timespan       codepre  pI am calling GetField to look for Items that have a field DefaultTimeToExpire so far this part works well to find the type I need. Next I call GetGenericArguments which returns an expected array of the type Arguments.  then I call MakeGenericType and finally Create instance wich gives me the error message p  pCannot create an instance of BusinessLogic.TestSubscriberXXX1[Message] because Type.ContainsGenericParameters is true.p  pThis looks like exactly what I am supposed to do.

Negative 4898 pI cannot find a solution as how to chop off part of a stringfilepath and use whats left to get another string.  p  pFor example if I have filepath Q2456blahblahfile.txt and I want to put this entire filepath into an array and delete from left characters 0 through 8 which is consistent for my application so Id have blahblahfile.txt left for my array.  p  pThe blahblah portion is going to be a dynamic length, but it will always be letters.p  pSo then Id like to take the blahblahfile.txt and pull just from that beginning up to the next  symbol, getting blahblah as a string.

This is typical of the other repositories.p  pHOWEVER Im not sure which project  layer they should be implemented in.  I have 5 projects in a solutionp  ol lipstrongSimpleOrder.ConsoleClient presentationstrong  I want to inject the specific implementation of the domain from here as the applicationpli lipstrongSimpleOrder.ApplicationFacade application servicesstrong  chunky higherlevel, coarsergrained methods orchestrating lowerlevel methods in the domainpli lipstrongSimpleOrder.Contractsstrong  DTO classes used for communication between presentation and application servicespli lipstrongSimpleOrder.Domain domain  bllstrong  domain model classes Customer, Order, OrderItem, Productpli lipstrongSimpleOrder.Repository dalstrong  implements the repository interfacespli ol  pHere are my options as I see itp  pstrongOption 1strong Define the repository interfaces in SimpleOrder.Contracts ...p  pPRO this is where I emthinkem they should belong because I created this to share contracts between various concerns  layers.  ex., DTOs are defined here.p  pCON however the method signatures in of each interface references Domain model classes.br This means that I would have to add a reference to the SimpleOrder.Domain, but when the  SimpleOrder.Contracts is referenced in another project, it will have to carry  SimpleOrder.Domain along for the ride.  This doesnt feel right.p  pstrongOption 2strong Same scenario as above, but I ALSO define interfaces for each Domain model class in the SimpleOrder.Contracts so I can break the coupling of the repository interfaces to the actual model classes.p  pExamplep  pre      namespace SimpleOrder.Domain.Interfaces              public interface ICustomerRepository                      ICustomer GetCustomerByIdint customerId             void SaveCustomerICustomer customer                   public interface ICustomer                      int CustomerId  get set              string Name  get set              System.Collections.Generic.List Orders  get                 pre  pIMPACT Each domain model class would have to implement his related interface.  i.e.,p  pre      public class Customer  SimpleOrder.Domain.Interfaces.ICustomer              public Customer                      orders  new List                   public int CustomerId  get set          public string Name  get set           private List orders         public virtual List Orders              get  return orders                 pre  pPRO Fixes Option 1s problem.p  pCON This explodes the number of files and the perceived complexity in the project because each domain class now has an associated interface. p  pstrongOption 3strong Define the repository intefaces in the SimpleOrder.Domainp  pIMPACT In order to inject the concrete repository classes into the application services layer SimpleOrder.ApplicationFacade project from the SimpleOrder.ConsoleClient at runtime, SimpleOder.ConsoleClient will ALSO need a reference to SimpleOrder.Domain.p  pPRO This ALSO solves Option 1p  pCON I was trying to avoid referencing the domain layer from the presentation layer directly because now the presentation layer can know too much about the domain layer.  When I replace the console application in the future with a WPF or ASP.NET MVC app in the future, I risk second and subsequent presentation layer implementations from attempting to call methods in the Model instead of the Application Services layer. However I do consider this in Option 4.p  pstrongOption 4strong Put the interfaces in SimpleOrder.Domain, then reference the SimpleOrder.Domain from the SimpleOrder.ConsoleClient.  p  pPRO Fixes all the problems above.p  pCON This doesnt feel right because I would be providing access from the presentation layer directly to the lowerlevel methods in the Domain layer when I should emonlyem be providing  access to the higherlevel chunky methods in the SimpleOrder.ApplicationFacade.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong Ive tried each of these, but have settled on Option 4, HOWEVER that leaves a bad taste in my mouth about it.

If I move this code to a subclass of Panel with a red background, it renders the red background then renders a blue square with a gray border in front of it. Note its not clipped to the bounds of the control which is how I can see all of that square.p  pIf however, I simply change the subclass to UserControl, the blue square with a gray border renders behind the red control.  Again, I can see this because I have clipping disabled.p  pIf finally I change it to a subclass of Control, I no longer get the red background and emonlyem get the blue square with a gray border.  This I take it is because Control doesnt do any rendering on its own, but still doesnt explain why the background color is rendering over my drawing in a UserControl as opposed to the Panel.  My guess is theres some element thats part of a template thats appearing in front of whats rendered, but I cant think what that would be.p

It is always positive and never infinite. I handle zeroes specially. I expect the values to range from pennies to as high as 100 billion. The rounding coarseness will change as the algorithm proceeds to maintain a maximum array size between 10,000 and 1,000,000. Only testing will reveal the sweet spot in the tradeoff between speed, memory and accuracy. Because of the range of values versus array size, direct addressing is not practical I need sparse storage.p  pThe naive approach is to use a List and perform a BinarySearch to find the key or insertion point, then proceed from there. This is fast for finding the nearest key, can be iterated in key order, but inserts are horrible. I do not need to perform deletes Each iteration in the outer loop creates a new list from scratch.p  pWhat data structure is recommended Wikipedia mentions a few, like Trie, Judy array, etc.p  pI implemented something Trielike with similar characteristics years ago, but that was in java, took me a week to implement, and was tricky. I am crunched for time.p  pUPDATEp  pThe suggestion of SortedSet causes me to modify my requirements. While finding the next lowest and next highest key was my way of accomplishing my task, SortedSet.GetViewBetween goes about things differently. Since I just want to see if there is a value close enough to be aggregated with, and I have a certain rounding granularity G, I can just ask for all elements of interest using p  precodevar possibilities  mySet.GetViewBetweenx  G, x  G codepre  pIf that set is empty, I need to add. If it is not, it is probably a small set and I iterate through it.p  pI need to perform performance testing to see if it is fast enough. But even if it does not, another collection that has the same contract is an acceptable alternative to FindNextHighestKey and FindNextLowestKey.p  pUPDATE 2p  pI have decided to use plain Dictionary, and force the keys into buckets using a custom rounding function. Iterating the items in sorted order is not crucial, and by using this rounding function, I can find close enough values with which to aggregate. I will not change the granularity during an iteration I will adjust it every time I finish convolving with a new dimension. Each iteration I create a new array to hold the results of that pass.p

Negative 4898 pI have a server process, and this server process can be given a command to update itself.  What it does is store the update and then use system to run an update script in the background.  The update script kills the parent process, deletes the binary, replaces it, and then restarts it.p  pThe restarted process has failed for various reasons as I have tried to debug it, but this time, its because a TCP port Im trying to allocate is already in use.  Im guessing that the child process inherits the open port, which is then inherited by the updated server process, and as a result, the port isnt free for the process to allocate it again.p  pThe way the update script is launched is thisp  precodesystemusrlocalbinupdatescript.sh gt devnull 2gtamp1 amp codepre  pThen the script does thisp  precodekillall serverprocess rm usrlocalbinserverprocess cp tmpupdateserverprocess usrlocalbin serverprocess gt devnull 2gtamp1 amp codepre  pAny suggestions on how I might make this work  Is there some way I can detach the update script so that the server process is no longer its parent before it performs the update  Or make the child process not inherit any of the parents resourcesp  pThanks.p  pAddendum  A solution would be to set codeFDCLOEXECcode on every open file descriptor.  Unfortunately, some of those fds are buried in libraries, which Id have to seriously hack up in order to make them set codeFDCLOEXECcode.  Somehow, I need to make codeFDCLOEXECcode the default.  Or I need to do something drastic, like iterate over all open fds how and set codeFDCLOEXECcode.  p

Negative 4898 pIn kendo 2012.3.1114, I ran across a numeric text box issue see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14656847howcanihavekendonumerictextboxkeepfocusduringhighlightinginakendowiHow can I have kendo NumericTextBox keep focus during highlighting in a kendo windowa. p  pIve been unable to find a work around so in the interim I hesitantly decided because Im near end of the project release cycle to try version 2012.3.1315. During my regression testing, I found that issue to be fixed but hideColumn of the grid component to be broken. p  pHeres a jsfiddle showing the issuep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.nete6shF42 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nete6shF42ap  pHeres the codep  precodevar grid  grid.kendoGrid dataSource      data [         foo bar 10, moo y, coo 4, too test1,          foo bar 20,  moo z, coo 3, too test1     ]  , columns [              field foo.bar     ,                      field foo.moo     ,              field foo.coo     ,               field too      ]    .datakendoGrid  grid.hideColumnfoo.moo grid.hideColumnfoo.coo codepre  pNotice that the second call to hideColumn will hide the column header but not the column data. It appears making a grid.refresh call after the second column hide will remedy the issue but this is was not necessary in the previous version nor does the documentation indicate the call is necessary. I think this is a bug that was introduced, so I guess Im trading one issue for a new issue perhaps many issues. p  pAny thoughts on p  p1 how to fix this issue without a grid refresh or p  p2 why hideColumn is not working in the new version or p  p3 even better on how to fix the numeric text box issue in the other thread so I dont have to worry about hoping to catch and fix other issues in this new version prior to releasing p  pwould be greatly appreciated p

Negative 4898 pNot exactly sure how to phrase this question. In java if you have a static instance var and the owning class is in tomcatclasses or tomcatlib so that many different web apps children of the tomcat class loader can use it, changing the static var in one web app will affect the others.p  pIs this also true of a Scala companion object From what I understand under the hood Scala singleton objects are compiler created singleton Java classes referenced by a static variable. So the answer would be yes. If web app A creates a new scala Foo and web app B creates a new scala Foo and the Foo class is from a parent class loader, each web app will have its own instance of Foo, but really only one instance of Foos companion object.p  pAm I missing something herep  pThanks in advance for any insight.p

Negative 4898 pI am working on a project that basically consists of complicated form containers repeated in an ngrepeat. Each of these forms has enough functionality that it could easily be its own angular app, but instead they are repeated on the screen, and there can be up to 30 of them. p  pWith 5 or more of these on the screen, performance becomes very slow. Although I tried to disbale some of our heavier features, it seems that the big performance wins just come from disabling the uninteractable scopes. p  pI am looking for a good pattern to freeze the unused scopes.

Negative 4898 pIt seems that codeTypeConverter.IsValidcode uses the current thread culture but codeTypeConverter.ConvertFromcode doesnt. p  pThis makes it pretty useless to use codeTypeConverter.IsValidcode with the codeDateTimecode type unless you are in the invariant culture. Indeed, it seems to be a bug.p  pstrongDoes anyone know how to make codeTypeConverter.IsValidcode use the current culturestrongp  pThe following code demonstrates the problem.p  pIt uses two strings, one in DDMMYYYY format and one in MMDDYYYY format. p  pThe first part of the test is done in the Invariant Culture. It demonstrates that  codeTypeConverter.IsValidcode returns true for the MMDDYYYY string and that you can use codeTypeConverter.ConvertFromcode to convert that string to a codeDateTimecode.p  pThe first part also demonstrates that codeTypeConverter.IsValidcode returns false for the DDMMYYYY string.p  pFor the second part, I change the current culture enGB which uses DDMMYYYY dates.p  pI would now expect the codeIsValidcode results to be reversed, but it returns the same as before for the two strings. So it says that the MMDDYYYY string is valid.p  pHowever  and this is the important bit  if you try to use codeTypeConverter.ConvertFromcode to actually convert the string which codeTypeConverter.IsValidcode said was ok, you will get an exception.p  pIs there a way to work around thisp  precodeusing System using System.ComponentModel using System.Globalization using System.Threading  namespace Demo      class Program              void Run                       Start off with the US culture, which has MMDDYYYY date format.

Negative 4898 pI just have a knowledge question about UIButtons  iOS in general.p  pLets say you have a UIButton. You set the hidden property to YES. This makes it no longer visible in view, right But I noticed that while its no longer visible, it is also no longer clickable either. So, does this mean that setting hidden  YES also sets enabled  NOp  pJust curious. Thanks yall.p
Negative 4898 pSuppose I have a code for matrix multiplication. I want it such that the mapper output from each node would be taken by one reducer, ie. the key for one complete mapper output file will be same, which will be different from key of another node. eg. if one Mapper file outputs keyvalue pairs with key 1, then another Mapper will output keyvalue pairs as key 2 and so on.  I understand that maybe this cannot be done for this example, but if I could output the key as some particular datanode ID or something As in, the key in the output could be some partciluar ID for a given datanode. Is there a way to do thisp  pBasically I want all output from one mapper to go into one reducer somehow, and that can be achieved by giving them all strongone keystrong, and I also want some parallelism so that the mapper output is distributed through the cluster, so I want the key for each to be unique.  How to assign this strongone keystrong to certain data if the input is not organized like thatp  pPlease point out if additional information is needed. Thank you for your helpp

Negative 4898 pIm looking to do analysis on the binary executable of a program to create a list of parameters to a specific function call. I can use OllyDbg to find a list of all calls to the function, but dont see anything to show the parameters without actually executing the code. p  pIt looks like the function takes 2 parameters, each supplied with a simple PUSH directly before the CALL in each instance. I can use DiStorm to pore over the code for this single instance, but Id prefer a more general solution that I can use elsewhere. OllyDbg does seem to know the number of parameters when stepping into the function, so Id think its possible to determine the number of parameters through static analysis, but my understanding of x86 assembly is honestly very limited.p  pIs there an existing way to do this, or is my only option to use DiStorm and just grab the last 2 PUSH statements before each CALL to this functionp

Negative 4898 pI printed postcards with a coupon code saying get 10 off if you enter coupon code COMEAGAINSOONp  pUnfortunately for me, upon setting up the coupon code via my shopping cart PDG, I find that the max length of coupon codes not documented is 11 characters. So I need to make the users entry COMEAGAINSOON be submitted to the server as COMEAGAINSOp  pI figure there must be hopefully a js or other solution that does this, rather than reprinting my postcards. Its basically like I made a badstupid mistake at work and am trying to fix it before I have ended up costing my company a lot of money and perhaps my job with them. p  pIve tried a number of solutions Ive found here replacing the innerhtml, shorten string, but none seem to submit that emchangedem data directly to the right place. Also, I simply am not particularly advanced at coding, to say the least Im one of those designers who ends up doing web work when necessary. MaxLength is a thing, but I think it would frustrate users to not be able to enter the full coupon code they were emtoldem to use. p  pThoughts appreciated. Thank you very muchp  pPS  I am aware that this is a fairly basic dilemma, and that the community here is pretty advanced, and that perhaps this isnt the right place for this question.

Negative 4898 pFoundation 4s grid system, with its mobile first approach is a no brainer when it comes to styling the layout of a page when you already use other foundation elements whether it is textual content, the general layout of imagescontent on the page like main content and sidebars.p  pIn the following example page, each grey rectangle is made using grids and nested gridsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWj6Yg.png altenter image description herep  pI often find myself designing tabular data which consists of elements and subelements like individual grey boxes in the center of the previous image that look a little bit like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqD3bJ.png altenter image description herep  pSome elements like the controls have to be aligned, and when you click on an element it reveals a dropdown menu with more detailed information about the item.p  pI often use the grid system for this kind of elements during mockup phase, because its quick to archieve the alignment and try different widths, but when refining the design, the foundation grid gets in the way with its default behavior when resizing the browser, spacing and it produces a lot of grid specific markup making the html code hard to read and understand.p  pSo my question is do you use foundation grid for these kind of details in a design, and if not, whats your favorite way to get multiple elements on the same line with different alignments, and having certain elements aligned with each other simple divs with hardcoded width display table something else.p  pI know there is a new CSS3 a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebGuideCSSFlexibleboxes relnofollowflexboxa module coming to allow this kind of display but it looks more to me like a replacement of the foundation grid system than the way to go when styling this level of details in a design.p

Negative 4898 pI have a standard whole Mime source text string I need converted to either a Java or PHP object or both if you want to show off  so it can be manipulated in these platforms. I have looked everywhere but only seem to be able to create from scratch. So the below for example becomes an object that I can change headers or body parts, and the resend using the provided classes.p  pThe require application for this is a distributed one, where I can supply customers a small java program while their local email app can point SMTP to, which I have done, and obtained Mime string as below.p  pI then want to be able to access and manipulate the various parts like headers and individual body parts before sending. Surely there is some class or library which will offer this  If necessary I can simply send the string to a PHP script if there is a suitable solution in PHP however its on a shared server so I cannot simply add PHP extensions.p  precodeReturnpath lttimdomaina.comgt Envelopeto XXXXXXXXXXXX Deliverydate Thu, 19 Sep 2013 095417 0100 Received from XXXXXXXXXX [61.125]62344 helo[192.168.1.10]     by leopard.hostns.co.uk with esmtpsa TLSv1DHERSACAMELLIA256SHA256     Exim 4.80.1     envelopefrom lttXghamdXmgt     id 1VMa09000MOc4T     for tiXhamdaXcs.com Thu, 19 Sep 2013 095417 0100 MessageID lt523ABBB6.1080105datXics.comgt Date Thu, 19 Sep 2013 095414 0100 From Txgham lttiXamdatXics.comgt UserAgent Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 rv17.0 Gecko20130801 Thunderbird17.0.8 MIMEVersion 1.0 To TiXham lttiXamdaXics.comgt Subject Re Example References lt523ABB49.50403daXnics.comgt InReplyTo lt523ABB49.50403daXhanics.comgt ContentType multipartalternative  boundary000900010104080404030103  This is a multipart message in MIME format. 000900010104080404030103 ContentType textplain charsetISO88591 formatflowed ContentTransferEncoding 7bit  Example showing reply subpart and HTML ltapage.htmlgt  On 19092013 0952, TiXgham wrote gt Example email   000900010104080404030103 ContentType texthtml charsetISO88591 ContentTransferEncoding 7bit  lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta contenttexthtml charsetISO88591       httpequivContentTypegt   ltheadgt   ltbody text000000 bgcolorFFFFFFgt     lta hrefapage.htmlgtExample showing reply subpart and HTMLltagt ltbrgt     ltbrgt     ltdiv classmozciteprefixgtOn 19092013 0952, TiXam wroteltbrgt     ltdivgt     ltblockquote citemid523ABB49.50403daXanics.com typecitegtExample       email       ltbrgt     ltblockquotegt     ltbrgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt  000900010104080404030103 codepre

Negative 4898 pIm stuck on a problem that isp  phow to set a precondition for all the methods in class so that any method is invoked, these preconditions are checked and if they are met, the invocation begins. If not, an exception is thrown.p  pWhat I need that for Ive assumed that any instance of my class is in some state. And I simply want not to allow some methods to be invoked if the state is not correct.p  pFor example If my class is Player and his state is DEAD I wouldnt want his level to be increased while in this state.p  pThat example shows exactly what I need. Something like a filters on actions in PHP or something similar.p  pMy point is not to check manually, at the begining of all methods, if the conditions for being in the right state are met. Is there any solutions that meets my expectations Maybe some design patterns or somethingp

Negative 4898 pI know there are a lot of cases close to this, but I have not found any that matches my circumstances.p  pQuite a few of our clients backup large quantities of data using cygwin.p  pThe general environment is A windows based virtual domain controller host is esxi, but that is irrelevant The backup is going to an external encrypted raid device. which the system sees as a normal usb attached hard disk.p  pOS tends to mainly be sbs2011  08, in some rare cases sbs03.p  pCygwin, usually the latest version as it is kept up to date. and its snapshot package. The rsnapshot conf file is not really changed from its origianl state with the exception of target and destination, and some exclusions.p  pThe backup is triggered by a batch, which starts cygwins rsnapshot rsync process creating a backup from the windows server to the attached storage in hourly x2 daily x5 weekly x4 monthlyx6 backups. p  pThe source files are rsynced to the destination. the original order of the permissions is not preserved but the necessary permissions are kept, ie source has the group and a user admin with full access, the target has both but with special permissions, and within special, full access is granted. p  pWhen rsnapshot moves hourly0 to hourly1 it completes. all the files are linked properly. but it takes a long time due to every file getting a could not link cygdrivexxhourly.0path to filefile cygdrivexxhourly.1path to filefile Permission deniedp  pargs is commented out because anything put into args ie av etc does not work and nore does it need to as the destination in another way does have administratoren and admin with full permissions.p  pcygwin is installed using admin on the admin account, task scheduler is set to admin, and the tasks are run by the admin account with full access. p  pThe backing up process works. I believe the issue lies in the destination, I can understand that it could be related to issues between posix and acl but do not believe it is the cause as again, the permissions are granted.p  pSo I am asking the most experienced out there, if you have any ideas, things to try, change. Please could you let me know clearly.p  pKindest regards and appreciation.p  pDanp

The switch would for example use a DeviceFactory or something to create the instances. My thinking was it should be possible to search the devices table for a device by name and populate the collection references if this is the correct terminology without having to specify the collection to search in  this was my understanding of the point of schema inheritance  or have I completely misunderstoodp  pThanks for replies so farp

Negative 4898 pI have a program which, in short, needs to take a directory of files and write, into a file, the meta data and content of each file. The second step is to recover the directory from the file. p  pI am unable to think of a way to separate the metadata in the file so that it can be extracted easily under any circumstance. This is mainly because Linux allows almost every character to be used to name a directory or file except for codecode or code0code.

Negative 4898 pImagine you have a table of Persons, Busses, and a mapping table in between. You want to determine, given a set of people, who is on a given Bus. So you create a PHP page to return a simple list of Persons. You also want the page to be robust, so you want to return any error reflected from the DB or other failures. Also, PDO is used to make the site flexible.p  pTo reduce database queries assuming that querying the DB is the most expensive part, especially if the DB get big andor lots of visitors, you probably want to reduce the queries to the DB to an absolute minimum.p  pA simple script would, after validating the data for types and other unintended values, probably look like such on the DB sidep  precodeSee if the Bus exists SELECT id FROM Busses WHERE idbusid  See if the given Persons exist SELECT id FROM Persons WHERE id IN commaseperatedpersonids  Finally check the mappings table and discover who is on that bus. SELECT personid FROM BussesPersons WHERE busidbusid personid IN commaseperatedids codepre  pI think this order is important, because suppose a bus did not exist, this page would return success and show an empty list if the first query did not execute to determine existing busses. You would also return a successful page with no persons, if none of the persons existed and you hadnt performed the second query to determine which of your persons set exists, and which dont. Strictly, you should return an error page if emanyem provided data is invalid or nonexistant.p  pemHow can I get a list of Persons on that Bus, given a set of persons, and given a bus, strongANDstrong find out if any given person or bus does or does not exist, and all that in a single queryemp  pI suppose you can hack about really deeply even though to maintain DB abstraction with PDO, you probably cant go too far either, or it becomes a question of DB execution time. But I was really wondering how other developers made their scripts faster and more efficient when stumbling upon the problem herep

Negative 4898 pI have been searching for a long time, and cant find an answer to this seemingly simple question. I have a 3d space and my camera has x, y, z, yaw, pitch and roll variables, and I want to be able to move the camera forward toward whatever I am looking at.

How can this be changed to also be relative to your pitch, so that you will always move toward whatever the camera is looking atp  pEDITp  pBy moving forward, I mean that by moving your camera a certain amount on each axis, that amount depending on your yaw, pitch and roll, whatever is in front of you, will appear to get larger.

Negative 4898 pIm working on a windows based application in C that requires facebook login. Im using using Ole EmbeddingActiveX control with the CLSIDWebBrowser component IWebBrowser2 to do the authentication.p  pThis works pretty well in so far as I create a window, embed the activeX web browser control, and then I direct it to the facebook login with an authorization url, such as... p  pa hrefhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthauthorizeclientidxxxxampredirecturihttpswww.facebook.comconnectloginsuccess.htmlampscopebasicinfo relnofollowhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthauthorizeclientidxxxxampredirecturihttpswww.facebook.comconnectloginsuccess.htmlampscopebasicinfoap  pxxx is set to our app id. p  pThis works, and you can login. The problem is if I quit and restart the app, even if Ive selected keep me logged in in the web page, I will generally have to retype in my password. p  pI say generally, because if I dont use the facebook auth url above, and say go to www.facebook.com, within my active x control and log in  it will remember that Im logged in, and I dont have to type in password if I shutdown and restart the app.p  pAs another side detail all of this is separate from the behavior of just running IE. If I run IE and login  it has no effect on the login inside of the app. And its not something that is unique to my implementation of ActiveX control embedding. If I run the JUCE library demo  which has a web browser active X component, it has the same behavior as with mine. That is...p  p1 I can login via a hrefhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthauthorize relnofollowhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthauthorizea  but if I restart the demo, it wont remember my previous login 2 If I login via www.facebook.com then it does remember Ive logged in    Actually a login like this in JUCE will allow me to login without a password from my app 3 Login from IE has no effectp  pIts tedious to have to login every time, and seems like incorrect behavior to have to do it if you select remain logged in. It does not appear that its a problem with the ActiveX control saving session state  as session state is maintained when I use the www.facebook.com login. It may be worth saying  I cant use www.facebook.com login, because it doesnt return the information that the app requires to work, thats what the authorize style url is all about.p  pThe implication seems to be that facebook is doing something different in these scenarios  its not storing the login information if you use the authorization url. p  pSo my question is how to fix the problem  such that remain logged in will remain logged for an application authentication through the authorization urlp  pI guess as a work around, you could store the authorization token in the app, and try and see it that token is valid at startup perhaps. Im not sure thats the right way to do it.  Also note  my original implementation used Ole Automation effectively my app controlled a separate IE process, and it had none of these problems. BUT unfortunately with IE 11, Ole Automation seems to have been broken.p  pThank you for your time and wisdom.p

Negative 4898 pstrong EDIT Sorry, just realised  this code was working fine, until I made the table have three sections. When it was a single section with section headings evrything worked fine when scrolling. Now I have theree sections it crashes when scrolling.strongp  pIm adding a button to a uitablecell. Crash occurs when table contents extend beyond table height, and the table is scrolled extreme bottom.p  pFrom the error it looks as if the UIButton isnt being created, it reports back JobsCell instead...p  pAlso the layout in the custom UITableCell goes awry. it looks like the JobsCell class isnt being initiated for cells that need to be reused and displayed back on screenp  precode

Negative 4898 pI have this program which consists of a loader and different statically linked modules. The entrypoint of the program goes into a loop which executes all the module initializationroutines. The functionpointers to these routines are stored in a constant array in the main.cpp file. p  pMy problem is that everytime I want to add or remove one of the modules I have to modify the array. I feel like there should be a method of automating this process. Is there a way to let the preprocessor load and parse a textfile holding the functionnames Or can I append new entries to the constant array from another .cpp file How do I generate this array at compiletimep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4898 pAfter a long discussion with Infragistics it appears that ShortCuts with SHIFT are displayed as MAJ in my culture nlBE. First of all, the culture nlBE and AZERTY is somewhat of a strange thing. Read a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAZERTY relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAZERTYa if want to know more. The important quote isp  blockquote   pThe other keys are identical, even though traditionally the names of   special keys are printed on them in English. This is because Belgium   is predominantly bilingual FrenchDutch and officially trilingual a   third language, German, is spoken in the East Cantons.p blockquote  pSo MAJ is printed as SHIFT. In Office for instance, Shortcuts with SHIFT are displayed as SHIFT. In the Infragistics controls however they are displayed as MAJ. And this frustrates our customers.p  pSo, after a discussion with Infragistics they claim that its a Windows Api call that is returning the MAJ instead of SHIFT. I have gotten a sample project from them which shows the behavior. So now my question is why the Windows Api call doesnt return SHIFT, and if its normal, then how does Office do it to display it correctp  pThe code to get the text of the key is p  precodeNativeWindowMethods.GetKeyNameTextintscanCode, sb, 256 codepre  pandp  precodeclass NativeWindowMethods      region MapVirtualKey     [DllImportuser32.dll]     internal static extern int MapVirtualKeyuint uCode, uint uMapType     endregion MapVirtualKey      region GetKeyNameText     [DllImportuser32.dll, CharSet  CharSet.Auto]     internal static extern int GetKeyNameText         int lParam,          [MarshalAsUnmanagedType.LPWStr, Out]System.Text.StringBuilder str,          int size     endregion GetKeyNameText  codepre  pIn case of the Shiftkey, the scancode is 2752512 2a and MAJ is returned.p  pSo, what are my questionsp  ul liIs it normal that MAJ is returned for the culture nlBE Or is it a bug in user32.dllli liIf Office gets it right, isnt it up to Infragistics to also get it rightli liDoes Infragistics use the correct user32.dll api callli ul  pFor completeness Ill paste the full code for the Utilities class.

Negative 4898 pI think this issue is easy to figure out, but Im just not getting it because Im relatively new to Drupal.  Im trying to create something similar to the Game News section on NCSofts site a hrefhttpus.ncsoft.comen relnofollowhttpus.ncsoft.comena where the title, then summary of the body of the story is on one side and the icon for that game is on the left.p  pI could easily create a content type that has an image field in it and then upload the appropriate icon for each story, each time.  A better solution would be to create a field in the GameNews content type called GameNewsSubject and write an override tpl file to display the proper logo depending on which game the story is about.  But, if possible, Id like to create two different content types One that has the basic article stuff and what game the article is about and a second content type that has the subject the game is about and the logo that goes with it.p  pThat way, anytime I needed to add or change a logo, I could just deal with the GameLogo content type.  And anytime I, or any other manager of my site, wanted to write an article about a game all wed need to do was hit Add Content  Select GameNewsStore  Write the article  Select from radio buttons what game the article is about  Enter and boom, the article appeard on our front page just like the articles on the NCSoft page shows up.p  pIve been stuck on this for months.  Id really appreciate very detailed information on how to solve this.  Thanks.p

Negative 4898 pAll of our services take a ServiceCallContext object as a parameter. The service then creates a broker and tells the broker what connection string to use based on the ServiceCallContext.p  pIn other words, some of our customers have their own databases so the service calls have to point the brokers to their databases.p  pI would like to take the code that looks at the ServiceCallContext and chooses the correct connection and put it in a base service class. My team lead doesnt like that idea because with services he feels that this would be hiding behavior and that this would be a bad thing. He suggested that there may be better ways to accomplish the same thing through some sort of WCF extensions.p  pI honestly dont care how we implement the code so long as I can reuse it because I think its absolutely silly for me to be rewriting it in every service I create. I began looking into some WCF videos on PluralSight and it looks like theres a lot of great stuff it can do but unfortunately Im not quite sure where to start. Can anyone give me a little direction as to whether WCF can accomplish what Im trying to do and if so what particular features of WCF am I looking forp

Negative 4898 h1TLDRh1  pI want to set up a local HTTPS proxy that can emLOCALLYem modify the content of HTML pages on my machine.  Is this possiblep  h2Motivationh2  pI have used an HTTP Proxy called a hrefhttpglimmerblocker.org relnofollowGlimmerBlockera for years.  It started in 2008 as a proxybased approach to blocking ads as opposed to browser extensions or other OS Xspecific hacks like InputManagers. But besides blocking ads, it also allows the user to inject their own CSS or JavaScript into the page.  Development has seriously slowed, but it remains incredibly useful.p  pThe only problem is that it doesnt do HTTPS a hrefhttpglimmerblocker.orgwikiFAQAdsonhttpspagesarenotblocked relnofollowfrom its FAQap  blockquote   pstrongAds on https pages are not blockedstrongp      pWhen Safari fetches an https page using a proxy, it doesnt really use the http protocol, but makes a tunneled tcp connection so Safari receives the encrypted bytes. The advantage is that any intermediate proxies cant modify or read the contents of the page, nor the URL. The disadvantage is, that GlimmerBlocker cant modify the content. Even if GlimmerBlocker tried to work as a middleman and decodedencoded the content, it would have no means of telling Safari to trust it, nor to tell Safari if the websites certificate is valid, so Safari would think you have visited a dubious website.p      pFortunately, most adproviders are not going to switch to https as serving pages using https are much slower and would have a huge processing overhead on the adproviders servers.p blockquote  pBack in 2008, maybe that last part was truebut not any more.p  pTo be clear, I think the increasing use of SSL is a good thing.  I just want to get back the control I had over the content after it arrives on my end.p  hr  h2Points of Confusionh2  pWhile searching for a solution, Ive become confused by some apparently contradictory points.  p  pAlso, although Im quite experienced with the languages of web pages, Ive always had a difficult time grokking networks and protocols.  On that note, sorry if Im missing something that is way obviousp  ul lipI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions516323httpsconnectionsoverproxyserversthis StackOverflow questiona asking whether HTTPS proxies were possible.  The best answer says that TLSSSL The S in HTTPS guarantees that there are no eavesdroppers between you and the server you are contacting, i.e. no proxies.  The same answer then described a hack to pull it off, but I dont understand the instructions. It was very theoretical, anyway.pli lipIn OS X under strongNetwork Preferences  Advanced  Proxiesstrong, there is clearly a setting for an HTTPS proxy.  This seems to contradict the previous statement that TLSSSLs guarantee against eavesdropping implies the impossibility of proxies.pli ul  h2Other things of noteh2  ul lipI cant remember where, but I read that it is possible to set up an HTTPS proxy, but that it makes HTTPS pointless by breaking the secure communication in the process.  strongI dont want thisstrong  Encryption is good.  I dont want to filter anyone elses traffic I just want something to customize the content emafterem Ive already received it.  pli lipGlimmerBlocker has a nice GUI interface, but Im fine with nonGUI solutions, too.

Negative 4898 pIm certain it is possible to have a repository return objects of various data types. We have an inhouse API that returns student test scores for different types of tests. My assignment is to get those scores, transform them to a standard model and then import the scores into a student information system using another API. Currently I am working on the part of importing the scores. My plan is to have a processor for each test type that will import, transform and load the scores. There is a repository that will pull the scores from the API and return them to the processor. Below I have working code that does that for the Reading scores. But I also have 4 other types of scores, each having a slightly different model, and may eventually have more.p  pBelow is code that works for the Reading scores, my question is  how can I reuse this repository to return the differenty score models without writing a Task for each score type p  pHere is what I THINK Ive figured out so far. The processor should be passing just the type of score I want, not the specific URL as my code is currently doing, breaking the reposity pattern, something likep  precodevar data  assessmentAPIRepository.GetScoresReading codepre  pAnd the interface should be receiving a type, something like...p  precodepublic interface IAssessmentApiRepositoryltTgt codepre  pBut I dont know where to go from there.

Negative 4898 pI am trying to learn and implement MEAN stack node, express, mongo, angular to create an SAAS application I have been working on.p  pCurrently im working on the REST API that the frontend will consume. I am having trouble understanding  deciding on an authentication scheme.p  pI am looking into passport.js to use with the REST API but I feel like maybe im confused about its implementation. Everything I read about oauth 2.0 says its pretty much the defacto standard for authentication with modern REST apis however most of what im reading says you click a button and it asks for authorization, just like a facebook or twitter signon.p  pSo im wondering, is it even necessary to have a token based authentication if I just want my users to provide an email and password and sign in.p  pCan someone explain this at least If I use Oauth 2.0, do I have to have sign in buttons that initiate some kind of facebook connect looking flow, or can I have a user provide an email and password and use that as a means to obtain the tokens from the oauth server.p  pSO CONFUSED. haha. I just need to figure out a good, acceptable way besides plain old username  password authentication to secure the api so I can get on with the build. All suggestions and links to applicable tutorials are appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 4898 ol lipIm currently stuck with the idea of the speed algorithm, as far as I know the lift is not travel at constant speed, it accelerates from stationary up to a certain point to reach its maximum velocity. Ive been given this formula t  vma where t  time to reach to maximum speed, vm is the maximum speed the lift can reach and a is the acceleration value, let says now I have t  5s, vm  1 floorsecond, so a will be  0.2 so it means it take 5s for the lift to reach to next flooram I right and travelled in constant speed of 0.2floorsec, but this violates the acceleration part, as the lift accelerating to maximum speed then travel at maximum speed. So my question is how can I develop this algorithm so it is accelerating and reach to destination at the time givenpli lipHow can we move a rectangle smoothly It seems jumping to me every time I tried to move the shape up and down.pli ol  pThanks for you help guys p

Each employee type has their own pay codep  p1 for Managersbr 2 for Hourly Workersbr 3 for Commission Workersbr 4 for Pieceworkers.p  pWrite a separate function to handle each paycode type.  Use a switch to  compute each employees pay based on that employees paycode.   Within  the switch, prompt the user to enter the appropriate facts the program  needs to calculate each employees pay based on that employees paycode.br Add reasonableness checks as appropriate e.g., salary between 0  100000,  hours worked between 0  84, hourly rate between 0  250, weekly sales  between 0  1000000, number of pieces between 1  1000, wage per piece  between 0.01  1000.  Use constants.p  pHere are the program constants     include p  precode  constants define MANAGERS                1 define HOURLYWORKERS          2 define COMMISSIONWORKERS      3 define PIECEWORKERS            4 define STOPPROGRAM            1 define COMMISSIONPERCENT      0.057 define COMMISSIONPAY          250 define OVERTIMEHOURS          1.5 define MAXHOURSWORKED        40 codepre  pHere is the code I have so far for the Hourly Worker functionp  precodevoid calcHourlyWorkerPay      float hourlyPayRate     int totalHoursWorked     float totalPay      printfYou entered 2 for Hourly Worker.nn     printfEnter hourly pay rate.n          Entry must be between 0 and 250      scanf  f, amphourlyPayRate     printfEnter total hours worked.n          Entry must be between 0 and 84      scanf  d, amptotalHoursWorked      if totalHoursWorked lt MAXHOURSWORKED ampamp totalHoursWorked gt 84             codepre  pThe reason I am asking is because I want to add validation to this where if the user enters a number that is not between 0 and 84, it will say something like Entry invalid, please enter a number between 0 and 84.

Negative 4898 pSuppose I am given a set of tokens W  w0, ..., wn and correspondingly a set of a hrefhttpwww.nlm.nih.govresearchumlsMETA3currentsemantictypes.html relnofollowsemantic typea classes C  c0, ..., cm.  For each class label ci, I am given a set of tokens which belong to that semantic type.  Note that tokens can be phrases or multiword expressions, e.g. emthe carem is as much as a token as emthe surging crowdem. p  pI cannot simply use something like NB, since more or less each training instance for a given semantic type is strongdiscretestrong, there is no context or features to extract from the token itself, i.e. the fact that the letters emc, a, rem make up the token emcarem does not tell me that I should classify it is a VEHICLE.  To simplify matters, I will also not have available the syntactic context of each token training or testing or otherwise, just the token itself.p  pSupposing that I made sure to pick homogenous words that cluster into some sensible semantic type for each semantic type label ci, what would be the most intuitive and standard way to begin classifying a given token into one of the semantic types, given the information outlined in the second paragraph above  p  pMy first idea is to simply compute some metric of type distance from the token to all the classified instances of each semantic type ci.  To do this, I would use the ubiquitous a hrefhttpwordnet.princeton.edu relnofollowWordNeta.  p  pThe algorithm would basically be like thisp  ol lipFor each word within a token, calculate its average similarity to each word in the semantic type list.  Take the average of all of these subaverages to get the average similarity a token has to that semantic class.  pli lipRepeat 1 for every semantic label.pli lipClassify the token by the label which gets the highest score  similarity.  pli ol  pSo for example, suppose I have MACHINE  [computer, washer, dryer] and VEHICLE  [car, train, plane] and my token to be classified is [crazy bus].  Thankfully WordNet is set up correctly, so computing the average similarity between the token and MACHINEVEHICLE finds that VEHICLE is higher.  p  pIn my actual case, I have about 160 training tokens for each class.  p  pNow I would like to know if there is a better approach to my problem andor issues with it.  p  pFor those curious, here are the results I had for choosing one of three semantic types.  Its not perfect by any means.  p  precodewe  0.50258880804   SPATIALENTITY i   0.50258880804   SPATIALENTITY where   0.497278579264  PLACE which   0.205933471291  PATH us  0.50258880804

Negative 4898 pI know contract we need to override hashcode when equals is overridden. Why should I consider same fields used for equals comparison to compute hashcode Is it to improve performance, by avoiding too many objects mapping to same bucket, as in below case i.e. all objects created on same date would map to same bucket and linear comparison will take time in checking object exists using equals methodp  pIf my above statement is true, what other potential issues will come with below code other than performance issue.

Negative 4898 pFor reference Previous problems with this situation have been solved in a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions26595110rewriteeveryrequesttoonefilewithurlasparameter2659659026596590this threada.p  pI am coding a small CMS in PHP and need to redirect all requests to that file called cms.php in my case. For examplep  precodeps0ke gt ps0kecms.phppathindex.html ps0keprojectscms.html gt ps0kecms.phppathprojectscms.html codepre  pand so on. There is also a codelangcode paramter that is set if en is preceding the directory. This should not be of importance because my problem existed before I added multilingual support. The goal is to have a CMS that just uses the file system structure to build the navigation and rendering templates. Therefore it is desired to keep the real files system structure represented in the URL. Right now I am using Apache and the following .htaccess to achieve the rewritep  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteBase mthcms   avoid any rules for resources and 2nd time  this is necessary in order to   be able to serve all files via cms.php  without having to change their URL RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d [OR] RewriteCond REQUESTURI .jpeggifbmppngtiffcssjs [NC,OR] RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS 200 RewriteRule   [L]   Serve index.html via cms.php when base dir or index.html is requested. Also  set the language. RewriteRule enindex.html cms.phplang2amppathindex.html [NC,L,QSA]   Serve everything else via cms.php. Also set the language. RewriteRule en. cms.phplang2amppath3 [NC,L] codepre  pThe problem I am encountering now is that if I dont use the p  precodeRewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d [OR] codepre  prule, the browser gets redirected to an URL with GET parameters if the request is for a emdirectoryem. When I click a link pointing to codeps0ketestsimagecode I land on the page codeps0ketestsimagelangamppathtests2fimagecode when using Firefox or Chrome. I dont really understand why, because using codecurl headcode I cannot see redirect headers. If I use the rule above suggested by anubhava, this issue is fixed. But then another problem occurs If the directory does not have an codeindex.htmlcode, Apache serves its codeIndexescode directory index. If I turn off indexing, I just get a 403. The desired result is that the path is just handed over to my script which takes care of everything like setting a 404 header and displaying an error to the client. This works if I dont use the above rule.p  pI hope there is a solution which solves both problems. Id better not rewrite the URL by appending a codeindex.htmlcode if a directory is requested, because this is better handled by my PHP script.p  pAnother issue which is not top priority is thep  precode    RewriteCond REQUESTURI .jpeggifbmppngtiffcssjs [NC,OR] codepre  prule. If I use it, resource loading works but again this is something that my script is capable of handling. Id rather do it in PHP that relying on the web server and a static list of file extensions. Before introducing the codeRewriteCondcodes suggested by anubhava it worked fine by just redirecting the resources to the script, too. If I now just remove this resourcespecific codeRewriteCondcode, I get errors with image files, that I dont understand. If anyone has suggestions on that, Id be happy to hear. But again the first issue is way more urgent.p

Negative 4898 pI found gperf to be suitable for my project and are now looking for a way to optimize the size of the generated table. As the switches i and j influence the length of the table deterministically, I wrote a small script iterating over those values, finding the minimal table length. The script stores the i and j values for retrieval of the current minimum table as well as the currently tried values, when the script is terminated, so it can continue its search later.p  pNow I saw that there exists a switch m, which states that it does exactly what I do with my little script. I guess using this switch is a lot faster than calling gperf for a single iteration only. But I need to know two things for replacing the gperf call, which I couldnt find in the gperf helpp  ol liWhich values if i and j are tried if I use the m switchli liHow do I know, which values for i and j are actually used, i. e. which are the values leading to the minimum found table lengh for the current gperf callli ol

Negative 4898 pHas anyone noticed that DOM scripting inside a WebView on Jelly Bean Android 4.3 results in extremely poor performance. Its so bad that it takes me around a full minute to add four new DOM elements into the DOM. Its only in v4.3. All other versions update the DOM almost instantly. I really want to settle this once and for all, is this an issue with Jelly Bean Has anyone else experienced such issues on Android v4.3p
Negative 4898 pUsing Android Studio 1.0, I have an activity with a listview using an adapter to display a custom layout.

Negative 4898 pIm working on a system that does cooperative scheduling of some complex tasks in python, with some complex global configuration managing. p  pRight now, I have a main system that calls the child tasks, and the child tasks often spawn a number of further children.

I have tried these optionsp  ol lidragged from the codeToolbarItemcode to codemasterControllercode class file, detailController class file and to codeNSSplitViewControllercode class.li lidragged from the ToolbarItem to the delegate class.li lidragged from the codeNSProgressIndicatorcode to codemasterControllercode class file, codedetailControllercode class file and to codeNSSplitViewControllercode class.li lidragged from the NSProgressIndicator to the delegate class.li lidragged from both the NSToolbarItem and from the NSProgressIndicator to the Window Controller First Responder.li ol  pIn all cases dragging does not make a window appear to allow me to create the outlet.p  pFor heavens sake, how do I create an outlet like that To which class I drag it and how do I do thatp

Its very simple at the moment p  precode     require        fuelfuel dev1.7master       codepre  pbut this fails to install, because nothing listed on packagist a hrefhttpspackagist.orgpackagesfuelfuel relnofollowherea has all dependencies satisfied. Ive tried 1.6, 1.7, 1.8. p  pAm I misunderstanding something Why can I not download fuel with composer p  pEDIT For clarity, Im not trying to create an entirely new project, but instead to just download fule library inside an existing project. gellu showed me how to manually add the repositories not on packagist, and by depending on codefuelcorecode instead of fuel itself, which downloads documentation,examples,and many other things I dont need, I was able to download just the library as I wantedp
Negative 4898 pIm creating an application and I want to set the icon for my codeJFramecode. I know how to set the icon, but Ive found out that different operating systems uses different icon sizes, so I wonder how I can make the program automatically use the icon with the appropriate size for the OS which the program is currently running on. Is there already a builtin function for this int Java if so, how can I use it, or do I have to create my own I know you can check the operative system by calling codeSystem.getPropertyos.namecode, but calling that, and comparing the result agains tons of different os names, and then choose the appropriate icon based on that, doesnt really sound like the best solution to me, but that might be the only wayp

Negative 4898 pI started to learn Backbone.js library by implementing a simple project. After seeing a few tutorials, I produced the code which is show below. I am aware that it might not look perfect since I am new to javascript development.p  pSo the below, I am fetching the list of nationalities from the API and then getting the number of students from those specific countries. This seems clear for the time being but the problem is, I need to get the total students per nationality which is why there is a counter in the second collection fetch function. The problem I am facing is about Javascript. Basically, defining total globally and updating it locally is what I need to do. I have come across to many threads similar to this one but to be honest didnt understand well enough to reproduce my own solution. Once again, my question is how I can reengineer this code so that I can update the value of the variable total locally and then use the updated result outside of the inner fetch function.

Negative 4898 pI have live application on the app store. It uses SQLite data storage and ugly methods that save and get data form it. I have replaced the data model with core data. So right now I have one table that contains favorites list. I suppose user will lose their favorites data, and the second problem will be that previous SQLite data base will be in the app.p  pWhats the best way to migrate that data to new data base. So code was ugly, I have started to write new project. It means that there will not be any SQLite data base as before with the same name, just new Core Data db. How usually we need to solve this problem.p  pI think I can add a method in app delegate that will check if data base with name in the application I will try to retrieve all data from that storage and convert it to the Core Data entities. Then when data will be converted with success, I will drop that database. When I will if all my active users will have this update. I will remove this feature from app delegate because all will up to date. Does it make sensep

Negative 4898 pI am working on an assignment, wherein, I receive a list of strings as an argument in a function. Based on the strings contained in the list I have to do some processing on the records. The strings contained in the list correspond to the member variables in the Record class.

It should be in codestart code I think My current script is definitely wrong and a bit wastefulp  pHere is the code, which works but isnt greatp  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections  public class Movement  MonoBehaviour       public Vector3 thumbStickInput     public PlayerInput gcPlayerInput      Vector3 targetRotation     public GameObject TankTurret, TankBase, Player        Use this for initialization     void Start             var gcPlayerInput  Player.GetComponentltPlayerInputgt            Why wont this be registered to work on update               Update is called once per frame     void Update            var gcPlayerInput  Player.GetComponentltPlayerInputgt  lt BAD         thumbStickInput  gcPlayerInput.thumbStickInput lt BAD.            if thumbStickInput  Vector3.zero               targetRotation  thumbStickInput             TankTurret.transform.rotation  Quaternion.LookRotationtargetRotation              print thumbStickInput            codepre  pTo break it down further incase theres any confusion.

The button still has codeView.VISIBLEcode after the above code has run. codebutton.invalidatecode doesnt work.p  pThe only thing that has worked so far is, obviously, recreating the activity, but this isnt ideal because user input is lost and its just not good practice.p  pAny advicep  pp  pEDIT so now instead of running a separate codeAsyncTaskcode for each device, all the connecting is done in one task, and the results are handled by codeonPostExecutecode instead of codetask.getcode. The end result is the same  the button vanishes.p  pp  pUPDATE Ive stepped through the code in debug mode and found that the button disappears after creating a codeDefaultHttpClientcode object org.apache.http.impl.client. Im going to step into that class and see if I can figure out where exactly it happens.p

Unfortunately the screen just stays black. I think there error might be connected to the fact that the vertice array has 2 components, but I cant figure it out. I thought I had understood the basics of openGL but apparently I was wrong, since this should really not be that hard of a problem. Yet I cant get anything drawn. If you need it I can post the remaining code, like the buffer creation but I think my mistake must be somewhere in this code. I hope this is not too much of a find the bug somewhere in my code post, but I really dont know where to go from here, I just cant figure out my mistake.p  pEDIT Found my mistake, I was passing int to the element index list, but I marked them as ushortp

Negative 4898 pIm running up against a problem with SQL Server Express that Ive never encountered before.p  pI have a table with 32 Million rows in it, with this column setp  precode[InspID] [nvarchar]8 NOT NULL, [NodeID] [int] NULL, [NodeVisible] [bit] NULL, [Note] [nvarchar]max NULL, [Points] [int] NULL, [QSTID] [int] NULL, [QSTNum] [int] NOT NULL, [ResponseNum] [int] NOT NULL, [Value] [nvarchar]max NULL, [ValueID] [int] NULL, [ValueVisible] [bit] NULL,  CONSTRAINT [QST2DPKi83] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  [InspID] ASC, [QSTNum] ASC, [ResponseNum] ASC codepre  pThe table is roughly 1900 MB, or maybe even a bit larger. Its hard to tell because I can do hardly any maintenance operations on the table without getting this errorp  blockquote   pMsg 802 There is insufficient memory available in the buffer pool.p blockquote  pAs I understand it, SQL Server Express gets 1GB for that. This happens when I try to change the primary key or do a codeDBCC DBREINDEXcode. The only way I can get the info out of the database and back in is by using BCP, and that is very inconvenient however, its interesting that it works. BCP allows me to restructure the table i.e. PK and then bring the data back in.p  pAnyway, further experimentation I dropped the row count down to 8.2M, and the overall table size to about 633MB. Still get the same errors, not enough memory. This is baffling, because that doesnt seem like a lot of data to me.p  pAt that point, I dropped the two codenvarcharmaxcode columns which further reduced the table size to about 540MB. At that point, I no longer run out of memory.p  pI cant tell if the buffer is complaining about row count or table size, but its feeling like table size based on this anecdotal evidence.p  pDoes anyone have a solution or insight into this I feel like we are barking up the wrong tree using SQL Server Express  which is too bad, because up to this point its fit our needs perfectly.p
Negative 4898 pI am trying to start zookeeper on a remote virtual machine. I use this for my project regularly and I do not have any problems while starting the zookeeper.

When I check for status using .zkServer.sh status it shows Error contacting service. It is probably not running. I am totally working with 5 Virtual Machines. All these machines were fine initially.

Negative 4898 pLets say I have Visual Studio, angular js project, mvc controller data feed. Using this I have created a simple page where I have text filter textbox and an additional checkbox condition.

Negative 4898 pi have a weird bug in my app that ive been working over two months. I know i should maybe paste some code but its probably pointless at this moment cause the bug spreads all over the application. Maybe its silly but it drives me mad cause I cant move forward from here. Maybe someone encountered the same problem and know whats up. Im pretty desperate at this moment and really dont know what to do.p  pthe thing is  wherever i want to put a text box, its always disabled. It doesnt work anywhere. Every other control im using works perfectly, but the textboxes just stopped working. I have no idea... the text boxes ive had in the app, on other pages, work perfectly. Im creating new pages and the boxes are always disabled on them. I know that the question is pretty general but i have no idea even which part of code to show, since the app is pretty big right now. Its really frustrating. Maybe im lucky and anybody has even a slightest idea of why the control can stop working on whole application all of the suddenp  pUPDATEp  pso what ive just realised is that the textbox usability depends on the container. It doesnt work in stackpanels and grids, but it does in listview. still dont know why though..p

Negative 4898 pIm using django 1.8.3 and djangoallauth 0.21.0 and Id like the user to be able to log in using e.g. their Google account without leaving the page. The reason is that theres some valuable data from the page theyre logging in from that needs to be posted after theyve logged in. Ive already got this working fine using local account creation, but Im having trouble with social because many of the social networks direct the user away to a separate page to ask for permissions, etc. Ideally, Id have all this happening in a modal on my page, which gets closed once authentication is successful.p  pThe only possible though not ideal solution I can think of at the moment is to force the authentication page to open up in another tab e.g. using targetblank in the link, then prompting the user to click on something back in the original window once the authentication is completed in the other tab.p  pHowever, the problem here is that I cant think of a way for the original page to know which account was just created by the previouslyanonymous user without having them refresh the page, which would cause the important data that needs to be posted to be lost.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas about how I could accomplish either of the two solutions Ive outlined abovep

Negative 4898 pIm working on a problem that on the surface seems easy but Ive been unable to find the key to solving it. I think harnessing the power of R its probably relatively trivial.p  pThe basic premise is this. You have 32 people at a networking event. There are 4 tables that seat 8 people at a time. At the event there are 4 rounds where people meet each other. The idea is to come up with a seating arrangement across the rounds that makes it so every person meets the max number of unique people across the rounds as possible.p  pSo basically you have a 16 tableround t1r1, t1r2,...etc. column X 32 number of people row array of 01 0  not seated at the tableround, 1  seated at the tableround. And the array has to meet the following conditionsp  ol liPeople can only have four rounds so all rowsums should be 4.li liEach tableround combo can only fit 8 people hence all colsums should be 8li liEach person can only be at one table once so rowsum of table columns has to be 1 t1r1  t1r2 t1r3  t1r4  1li liEach person can only be at one per round so rowsum of round columns has to be 1 t1r1  t2r1  t3r1 t4r1  1li ol  pIm sure theres mathematical solution, but I was thinking that it might be quicker to brute force it in r by generating matrices and saving those that meet these conditions. Is that the best way Im open to other suggestions.p

Archiving and unarchiving it doesnt work for codeUIImagecodes so codeUIImageViewcodes would show up blank.p  pAlso, I dont want to create them programmatically because they are too complex and the resulting code would be hard to read and maintain.p  pstrongEdit 1strong for those who still dont understand and really need some useless code to understand it, here is my codetableViewviewForHeaderInSectioncode methodp  precode UIView tableViewUITableView tableView viewForHeaderInSectionNSIntegersection       if [tableView.dataSource tableViewtableView numberOfRowsInSectionsection]  0          return nil           CGSize headerSize  CGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, 100       wrapper       UIView wrapperView  [UIView viewWithSizeheaderSize]      wrapperView.backgroundColor  [UIColor colorWithHexString2670ce]       title       CGPoint titleMargin  CGPointMake15, 8      UILabel titleLabel  [UILabel labelWithTextself.categoriesNames[section] andFrameCGEasyRectMaketitleMargin, CGSizeMakeheaderSize.width  titleMargin.x  2, 20]      titleLabel.textColor  [UIColor whiteColor]     titleLabel.font  [UIFont fontWithStyleFontStyleRegular andSize14]      [wrapperView addSubviewtitleLabel]       body wrapper       CGPoint bodyWrapperMargin  CGPointMake10, 8      CGPoint bodyWrapperViewOrigin  CGPointMakebodyWrapperMargin.x, CGRectGetMaxYtitleLabel.frame  bodyWrapperMargin.y     CGSize bodyWrapperViewSize  CGSizeMakeheaderSize.width  bodyWrapperMargin.x  2, headerSize.height  bodyWrapperViewOrigin.y  bodyWrapperMargin.y      UIView bodyWrapperView  [UIView viewWithFrameCGEasyRectMakebodyWrapperViewOrigin, bodyWrapperViewSize]      [wrapperView addSubviewbodyWrapperView]       image       NSInteger imageSize  56     NSString imageName  [self getCategoryResourceItemsection  1][image]      UIImageView imageView  [UIImageView imageViewWithImage[UIImage imageNamedimageName] andFrameCGEasyRectMakeCGPointZero, CGEqualSizeMakeimageSize]      imageView.layer.masksToBounds  YES     imageView.layer.cornerRadius  imageSize  2      [bodyWrapperView addSubviewimageView]       labels       NSInteger labelsWidth  60      UILabel firstLabel  [UILabel labelWithTextfirst andFrameCGRectMakeimageSize  bodyWrapperMargin.x, 0, labelsWidth, 16]      [bodyWrapperView addSubviewfirstLabel]      UILabel secondLabel  [UILabel labelWithTextsecond andFrameCGRectMakeimageSize  bodyWrapperMargin.x, 20, labelsWidth, 16]      [bodyWrapperView addSubviewsecondLabel]      UILabel thirdLabel  [UILabel labelWithTextthird andFrameCGRectMakeimageSize  bodyWrapperMargin.x, 40, labelsWidth, 16]      [bodyWrapperView addSubviewthirdLabel]      [[ firstLabel, secondLabel, thirdLabel ] forEachViewUIView view          UILabel label  UILabel view          label.textColor  [UIColor whiteColor]         label.font  [UIFont fontWithStyleFontStyleLight andSize11]     ]       line       UIView lineView  [UIView viewWithFrameCGRectMakeimageSize  labelsWidth  bodyWrapperMargin.x  2, bodyWrapperMargin.y, 1, bodyWrapperView.frame.size.height  bodyWrapperMargin.y  2]      lineView.backgroundColor  [UIColor whiteColorWithAlpha0.2]      [bodyWrapperView addSubviewlineView]       progress       CGPoint progressSliderOrigin  CGPointMakeimageSize  labelsWidth  bodyWrapperMargin.x  3  1, bodyWrapperView.frame.size.height  2  15     CGSize progressSliderSize  CGSizeMakebodyWrapperViewSize.width  bodyWrapperMargin.x  progressSliderOrigin.x, 30      UISlider progressSlider  [UISlider viewWithFrameCGEasyRectMakeprogressSliderOrigin, progressSliderSize]      progressSlider.value  [self getCategoryProgress]      [bodyWrapperView addSubviewprogressSlider]      return wrapperView  codepre  pand I would want it to look something like thisp  precode UIView tableViewUITableView tableView viewForHeaderInSectionNSIntegersection       if [tableView.dataSource tableViewtableView numberOfRowsInSectionsection]  0          return nil           SectionView sectionView  ...  get the view that is already designed in the Interface Builder      sectionView.headerText  self.categoriesNames[section]     sectionView.headerImage  [self getCategoryResourceItemsection  1][image]      sectionView.firstLabelText  first     sectionView.secondLabelText  second     sectionView.thirdLabelText  third      sectionView.progress  [self getCategoryProgress]      return wrapperView  codepre  pstrongEdit 2strong Im not using a codeStoryboardcode, just code.xibcode files.

Negative 4898 pSo I want to trigger a function when the user Even with view only permissions clicks a button that will run as the creators user. For example I create a spreadsheet that shows a list of stuff, the list might be updated from time to time but I dont want the time driven function or onOpen to drain my total runtime quota. So I want to create a button that runs a function as my user so when I share the link of the program with someone that can not edit the list he would still be able to refresh it.p  pI think installable triggers run as the triggers creator user so the solution might be there but I couldnt find it. Thanks for any help given, Gur.p

Negative 4898 pFor this code, I create an array list where a user is prompted to enter a coin of type String into a purse which is then added to the array list. I have a method that returns the array list, printing out the coins in the list. I created several other methods that act upon the array list in several ways. The main issue that I am having is creating a class called Coin, in which I want to assign a value to each coin entered in the array list coins. This would allow me to create a method to add up the values of each coin in the coins array or a method to spend a coin from the coins array. I thought about adding a public void setTypeString entered method in the Coins class to assign each coin entered a value, but I am not entirely sure how to go about it. Once it is made, however, I know that I want to create a list  List coinPocket  new ArrayListlt and a private method that adds the values from the Coin class to the array listArrayList coins  new ArrayList.

Negative 4898 pIm currently creating a spreadsheet database of translators and need to figure out a way of having a uniquely identifying number for each translator. The issue arises as one translator may have different language pairs eg english to french, spanish to french, and each of these language pairs is searchable and has its own price. p  pAs such, the database currently has a row for each language pair associated with a translator, and around 200 translators. For example, John Doe has a row for enfr and a row for esfr. Apart from the language pair and price, all other metadata name, email, address remains the same. So my question is, how do I structure this so that there is uid link between John Does language pairs I need to keep the language pairs for the same translator on separate rows for search purposes and for a mobile App. As you can no doubt tell, Im new to databases and Stackoverflow p

The layout looks like the wire frame in 1, it should not scroll on start. To open the bottom, more, section, user should click the pink strip which collapse smoothly the toolbar, the blue section, to half of its size. Then if scrolled up the blue section should smoothly and dynamically collapse further till it reaches the size of the tool bar and replaces it. If the user scrolled even further the blue section should stay there while the other elements scroll naturally.  I would appreciate referring me to any libraries, references, articles or clues about how can I do that, especially achieving a smooth transition between 1 and 2 in the blue section and beautifully resize the elements in the blue section.br Here is simple wire frame for the layout a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com8yLvg.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8yLvg.png altwire frame describing the behavior the layout I wanna accomplishap

Ive also searched extensively and, while Ive seen a lot of ideas but my jquery is not up to the task of modified what Ive seen apparently.p  pAs always, many thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langen xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtTestlttitlegt     ltstyle typetextcss mediascreengt         div floatleftwidth110px         input[typetext] width100px         submitWrapper clearbothmargintop20px     ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform nametestForm idtestForm methodpost actiongt         ltdivgtltinput typetext namefName idfName value placeholderFirst Namegtltdivgt         ltdivgtltinput typetext namelName idlName value placeholderLast Namegtltdivgt         ltdiv idnameErrorgtltdivgt         ltdiv idsubmitWrappergtltinput typesubmit valueSubmitgtltdivgt     ltformgt     ltscript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.2jquery.min.js gtltscriptgt     ltscript srcajax.aspnetcdn.comajaxjquery.validate1.13.0jquery.validate.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         document.readyfunction               testForm.validate                 rules                      fName                          required true                     ,                     lName                          required true                                      ,                 errorPlacement functionerror, element                      if element.attrname  fName                          error.appendTonameError                      else if element.attrname  lName                          error.appendTonameError                                      ,                 messages                      fName                          required  First name is required                     ,                     lName                          required  Last name is required                                                                 ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 4898 pIve read a few posts that state Microsoft is stopping support for HTA files or something, which leads me to question my choice of using .hta files for a project Im working on.p  pThe HTAs being used contain simple javascript, css and html code. The actual engine of the software Im creating is created using a commercial software. The HTAs are just to provide a pretty frontend for users.p  pWhat are the limitations of doing so Is there a better alternative or am I OK for the next 5 yearsp  pI like HTAs since they allow me to easily design a GUI using CSSHTML... and then add some simple scripts javajquery as needed.p  pThanks for your feedback.p

Negative 4898 pSay I have a third partys model and its not marked as abstract. I want to inherit it, add my own fields on top of that, and have it all be a single table in the database. Normally, that means I should inherit from an abstract model class, but I dont have that luxury in this case. Is there a way to have an intermediary step that creates an abstract class from the parent, so I can inherit from that one insteadp
