Positive 80035 pI have a Xamarin.Forms app that uses a local SqLite database as its source for data. The data is proprietary, so I want to protect it so that if someone gets access to the database file, they would have to decrypt it to access the data.p  pI also want to limit the number of queries users can make against the database so that at a certain point they have to purchase the ability to use more of the data inapp purchase.p  pI want to avoid making network calls as much as possible to minimize impact to the users data plan and allow the app to work well in conditions where there is poor or no connectivity. So, I want the data stored in a local database perhaps in SqLite.p  pIm curious how different people would approach this problem to protect the data and at the same time minimize network usage.p  pHere is kind of what I was thinking if its possiblep  p1 Let the user downloadinstall the app.p  p2 On first load, the app will upload a key based on the device id and the users current purchase information. Then it will download a SqLite database file that has been encrypted using the uploaded key.p  p3 When the user reaches their limit of queries, the database file is deleted. If they purchase more data, then a new key is uploaded and a new encrypted database is downloaded to be used.p  pThoughts Is there a better wayp
Positive 80035 pIn the Xamarin Forms files, I have an interface with a method GetCurrentLocation, and two properties both strings latitude and longitude. p  pIn the Xamarin iOS files, I have a class interfacing from previously mentioned interface. The method now expounded upon states that, upon activation, it creates a MKMapView, gets the Users lat. and long., and sets them to equal to the lat. and long. properties of the class As shown below.p  precode    public string latitude  get set      public string longitude  get set      public void GetCurrentLocation           var vm  new MKMapView         latitude  mv.UserLocation.Coordinate.Latitude.ToString         longitude  mv.UserLocation.Coordinate.Longitude.ToString      codepre  pFor this example, this method will only be called upon once, and the purpose is simply to get the lat. and long. of the device and display it in text. p  pAfter some dependencyservice shenanigans... Back inside the Xamarin Forms files, I have a page in which I call the method to get the location, then use the newly acquired coordinates to display the devices current location in text. I did set a custom location in the simulator, btw.p  pNow, my prob is that when I actually run the program, the displayed string says that the lat. and long. are both 0. Latitude  0, Longitude  0 WHYYYYYYYYYYY  emultimate sad faceemp  pAnyways, I look forward to hearing back from whoever answers, thanks for the helpp

Positive 80035 pGday, I am relatively fresh to Azure so bare with me on this  as a disclaimer I warn that there may be malformed understandings going on here, hopefully not, but maybe.p  pstrongThe Situationstrongp  pThere is an existing Windows VB Timesheet Application that deploys on customers Windows devices not RT. This application creates a local SQL express store and synchronises with an Azure SQL DB via SQL data sync.p  pThe Azure SQL DB further sychronises with a master DB also via SQL data sync that is stored locally where I am contracted, the master data is typically only changed in this master DB and the transactional data is what is synced up to azure.p  pThe tables the application is working with are all under the dbo schema.p  pI am working on creating a Xamarin Forms mobile iOS, WP8, Droid, and maybe winRT, using a PCL version of the application wordy, but you get the idea that uses an Azure Mobile Service that points to the Azure SQL DB. It only uses a subset of the features as of now.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pNow the problem as it may be obvious already is that I need access to most of the tables, of which are under the dbo schema, and I was hoping  wondering what the best practice would be to solve this.p  pIf I could point my Azure Mobile Service to use the dbo schema and give the generated login the appropriate privileges manually  scripted. This is needed for my migration of the tables to include the required system properties an so fourth.p  pAnother proposition would be to add the system columns required for azure mobile services sync operations to the master db, push them up to the azure db and then create views of all the required data in the mobile services schema. I do not yet know if this would result in any limitations to the service.p  pThere is always of course the option of moving all the data to a schema other than dbo  however this requires extension work on the other systems, which may consume considerable time particularly due to my unfamiliarity with them.p  pAny relevant information, discussion or advice would be thoroughly appreciated.p  pCheers.p

Positive 80035 pWe have a body of code already using SWIG for Java for Android mainly from a common C code base.  This uses a IXXXXListener interface pure abstract class in C to call back up to Java from the C.  This all works well.  However, I am now trying to make this work with C in order to work with Xamarin for iOS and Android and am having a problem with the delegates that the SWIG director creates for C.

See a hrefhttpdocs.xamarin.comiosaboutlimitations relnofollowhttpdocs.xamarin.comiosaboutlimitationsa for more information. p  pThe Xamarin documentation talks about applying the MonoPInvokeCallback attribute wherever a delegate is provided to the native code which I understand there can be no JIT on iOS.

Finished  codepre  pIm working on Xamarin and the same project runs great on Xamarin Studio and other instances of Visual Studio 2015, so I know this is a problem not with the code but with my configuration.p
Positive 80035 pI have a question about Reactive ui, its bindings, and how it handles ui updates. I always assumed that using ReactiveUi would take care of all ui updates on the ui thread. But I recently found out this isnt always the case.p  pIn short the question is How can I use reactiveui to twowaymodelbind a viewmodel and a view, and assure that updating the ViewModel doesnt crash when run on a different thread than the uithread Without having to manually subscribe to changes and update explicitely on the uiThread, as that defeats the purpose of reactiveui, as well as making it harder to encapsulate all logic in the PCL.p  pBelow Ive provided a very simple Android project using Xamaring and Reactiveui, to do the followingp  ul liButton with the text Hello Worldli liClicking on it appends a to the buttons text.li liI let the Activity implement IViewFor, and I use a ViewModel deriving from ReactiveObject, containing the text that I want to change.li liI bind the Activitys button.Text to the ViewModel.Text, to let reactiveui deal with all changes and ui updates.li liFinally, I add a function to the buttons onclick to append a to the ViewModel.li ul  pThe issue I have is the followingp  precodebutton.Click  delegate              this.ViewModel.Text  a                          does not crash         Task.Run gt  this.ViewModel.Text  a      crash      codepre  pDirectly appending a is not an issue. However, adding a on a different thread results in the wellknown Java exception Exception Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views.p  pI understand the exception and where its coming from. In fact, if I were to append the a on a different thread, I already had it working with simply not binding the text. But rather by subscribing to changes, and using the RunOnUiThreadmethod to make changes to the ui. But this scenario kind of defeats the purpose of using ReactiveUi. I really like the clean coding way of the simple statement this.BindViewModel, x  x.Text, x  x.button.Text, but if this stronghasstrong to run on the uiThread, I cant see how to make it work.p  pAnd naturally this is the bare mininum to show the problem. The actual problem as to why I bring this up is because I want to use the GetAndFetchLatestmethod from akavache. It gets data asynchroniously and caches it, and executes a function being updating the ViewModel. If the data is already in the cache, it will execute the ViewModelupdate with the cached result AND do the computationlogic in a different thread, and then call the same function again once its done resulting in the crash, because thats on a different thread, updates the ViewModel, which results in the crash.p  pNote that even though explicitely using RunOnUiThread works, I really dont want cant even to call this within the ViewModel. Because I have a more complex piece of code in which a button simply tells the ViewModel to go fetch data and update itself. If I were required to do this on the uiThread i.e. after I got data back, I update the ViewModel, then I cant bind iOS to the same ViewModel anymore.p  pAnd lastly, heres the entire code to make it crash. Ive seen the Task.Runpart sometimes work, but if you add some more tasks and keep updating the ViewModel in them, its bound to crash eventually on the UIthread.p  precodepublic class MainActivity  Activity, IViewForltMainActivity.RandomViewModelgt      public RandomViewModel ViewModel  get set      private Button button      protected override void OnCreateBundle bundle              base.OnCreatebundle          SetContentViewResource.Layout.Main          this.button  FindViewByIdltButtongtResource.Id.MyButton          this.ViewModel  new RandomViewModel  Text  hello world          this.BindViewModel, x gt x.Text, x gt x.button.Text          button.Click  delegate                              this.ViewModel.Text  a                          does not crash                 Task.Run gt  this.ViewModel.Text  a      crash                        public class RandomViewModel  ReactiveObject              private string text          public string Text                      get                              return text                          set                              this.RaiseAndSetIfChangedref text, value                                 object IViewFor.ViewModel              get                      return ViewModel                  set                      ViewModel  value as RandomViewModel                codepre

Positive 80035 pI am trying to create horizontal scroll list. Multiple forums recommended writing a custom renderer since there does not exists one. My final output is something like a hrefhttpscreencast.comtEmYDo1pE relnofollowthisa.p  pEach element in the scroll list is within a grid. The elements cannot be selected by tapping on them like listview. strongAnything between the lines is selectedstrong. So the structure of layout would be something like this to give you a rough ideap  precodeHorizontalViewList   StackLayout     Grid1       item1     Grid2       item2 codepre  pTo mark an element selected I basically take the x,y coordinates of the element and match it with the x,y coordinate of the two line. Currently I was only taking one case which is when the element x,y is less than the x,y of the line I know there are other possibilities, but I wanted to get one thing working. My problem is I am not able to get the x,y coordinates of the grid which is inside the scroll list wrt to the screen.p  pHere is my code of the above logicp  precodeprotected void OnElementPropertyChangedobject sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e      if this.cList  null               var stackLayoutChild  this.cList.Content as StackLayout          if stackLayoutChild  null                       int childCount  0             foreach Grid child in stackLayoutChild.Children                               var positionXStart  child.X                 var positionXEnd  child.X  child.Width                 var gridChild  child.Children [0] as Label                  if positionXStart gt selectionBoundXStart ampamp positionXEnd lt selectionBoundXEnd                                       this.cList.SelectedItemIndex  childCount                                          System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine Selected item is   gridChild.Text                                         break                                                                                            childCount                             codepre  pThe code to detect selectionBoundXStart and selectionBoundXEnd is something like this during the Draw of the ScrollViewRenderer selectionBoundXStart  this.GetX   mid oint  30 selectionBoundXEnd  this.GetX   midpoint  30p  pI am new to mobile development in general.

It submits the exact same value I could type into my browser window, except it does not work in contrast to just typing it into my url bar which DOES work.p  pNow Im thinking the perl wrapper code Im using is slightly wrong or something It is herep  pa hrefhttptechnotes.1000lines.netfastcgiwrapper.pl relnofollowhttptechnotes.1000lines.netfastcgiwrapper.plap  pI only made a couple of changes...

Negative 80035 pI came across an interesting algorithm question in an interview. I gave my answer but not sure whether there is any better idea. So I welcome everyone to write something about hisher ideas.p  pYou have an empty set. Now elements are put into the set one by one. We assume all the elements are integers and they are distinct according to the definition of set, we dont consider two elements with the same value.p  pEvery time a new element is added to the set, the sets median value is asked. The median value is defined the same as in math the middle element in a sorted list. Here, specially, when the size of set is even, assuming size of set  2x, the median element is the xth element of the set.p  pAn example Start with an empty set, when 12 is added, the median is 12, when 7 is added, the median is 7, when 8 is added, the median is 8, when 11 is added, the median is 8, when 5 is added, the median is 8, when 16 is added, the median is 8, ...p  pNotice that, first, elements are added to set one by one and second, we dont know the elements going to be added.p  pMy answer.p  pSince it is a question about finding median, sorting is needed. The easiest solution is to use a normal array and keep the array sorted. When a new element comes, use binary search to find the position for the element logn and add the element to the array. Since it is a normal array so shifting the rest of the array is needed, whose time complexity is n. When the element is inserted, we can immediately get the median, using instance time.p  pThe WORST time complexity is logn  n  1.p  pAnother solution is to use link list. The reason for using link list is to remove the need of shifting the array. But finding the location of the new element requires a linear search. Adding the element takes instant time and then we need to find the median by going through half of the array, which always takes n2 time.p  pThe WORST time complexity is n  1  n2.p  pThe third solution is to use a binary search tree. Using a tree, we avoid shifting array. But using the binary search tree to find the median is not very attractive. So I change the binary search tree in a way that it is always the case that the left subtree and the right subtree are balanced. This means that at any time, either the left subtree and the right subtree have the same number of nodes or the right subtree has one node more than in the left subtree. In other words, it is ensured that at any time, the root element is the median. Of course this requires changes in the way the tree is built. The technical detail is similar to rotating a redblack tree.p  pIf the tree is maintained properly, it is ensured that the WORST time complexity is On.p  pSo the three algorithms are all linear to the size of the set. If no sublinear algorithm exists, the three algorithms can be thought as the optimal solutions. Since they dont differ from each other much, the best is the easiest to implement, which is the second one, using link list.p  pSo what I really wonder is, will there be a sublinear algorithm for this problem and if so what will it be like. Any ideas guysp  pSteve.p

Negative 80035 pAs a longtime lurker on SO, Im popping my question cherry with a tricky one regarding CruiseControl.NET, Subversion, and a remote repository. Heres the problemp  pTake a remote Subversion 1.6.6 repository running on Windows Server 2008 SP2, using Apache 2.2.14 as the gateway to enable access on Port 80 and 443  we redirect unencrypted traffic to the secure port, and we have a properlyconfigured SSL layer running with a selfsigned certificate. This all works  I can point a browser from my local machine XP SP2 or Server 2008 SP2 to this repository, pass through the certificate verification painlessly, authenticate against the repository ACL, and see stuff in there. Equally, SVN commands executed on my local machine either at the commandline or via TortoiseSVN work flawlessly.p  pNow add CruiseControl.NET 1.4.4.83  running for the moment on my local machine with a simple script to pull some sourcecode from the remote repository, and build a very basic application. This same script works perfectly against a local repository, so the only difference is the Subversion URL, which is now pointing to the remote server.p  pIf I run CC.NET in a commandline shell ccnet.exe under my own account, it works.p  pIf I run CC.NET as a service ccservice.exe however, it fails by default, it runs as LOCALSERVICE, but I have already altered this to run with my credentials. In this mode, the very first Subversion command issued SVN LOG fails, complaining that it cannot connect to the server.p  pI have spent a good four or five days investigating this I know its not a firewalltype problem, because the exact same command that CC.NET issues works in a commandline shell, and of course I can connect to the remote server via TortoiseSVN and a browser. Its not the SSL andor certificate getting in the way, as I have already imported the certificate  and again, this works fine in manual mode using TortoiseSVN, a browser, or SVN commands at the commandline. Its not a DNS resolution issue, because I can specify the actual IP address of the remote server, and it still fails to connect  but of course connects OK if I run in commandline mode...p  pIve even downloaded and prowled through the CC.NET sourcecode to see if theres anything odd going on. As far as I can see, the only difference regarding issuing commands when running in servicemode is that an AllocConsole call has been made to prepare a console for the Subversion command processes to latch on to when theyre spawned.p  pThe best guess I can make, at this stage, is that the AllocConsole session is somehow fundamentally different from a standard commandline session  in that, even though the service is running under my user credentials, somehow the AllocConsole does not have proper network access. However, I dont know enough about AllocConsole or the CC.NET sourcecode to be able to prove this, and Im therefore at an impasse.p  pFor the moment, Im running CC.NET in commandline mode however, this just feels unsatisfactory, because we prefer to run it in service mode which works fine against repositories in our local domain to avoid the necessity creating a scheduled task to start it up when the machine starts.p  pAnyone got any suggestionsp

Negative 80035 pIm designing a document security system. Ultimately, the document breaks down into sections, and then into content elements. Then theres an security id, a GUID presumably, which is associated with the content element. When a user requests the content element, they supply a SID and the system determines whether theyre authorized or not. Search results are filtered in the same way. p  pThe system will operate in the opposite direction, too...given a security id, it will generate a navigation bar consisting of the documents that have sections that have content elements to which the user is authorized. Pretty cool stuff.p  pSo I can do all of this so far...what Im concerned about is that Im reinventing the wheel here...obviously, Im borrowing heavily from traditional Windows security, and it has shades of Active Directory. Anyway, I wanted to get some smart opinions on whether there are some existing technologies I can use for this rather than coding it from the ground up.p  pWhat I DONT want to do is use file security, so thats off the table from the beginning.

Negative 80035 pIm trying to read in an Excel spreadsheet with CASP.net. This entry a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15828readingexcelfilesfromcherea works great if the workbook is on my local drive.p  pHowever, when I attempt to access any workbook on a network share, I only get the first 30 rows of data.p  pWhen I used File.Copy to copy the file to the local drive of the server, I only get 35kb and the resulting file only has 30 rows of data in it when I open it in Excel.p  pHow can I get the file to open in full over the network, or how can I copy the full file to the local drive firstp  pEdit I should note that manually copying the file works perfectly fine. Opening the file over the network shows the full contents of the file in Excel. Only when accessing the file through the ASP.NET application does it limit its self to 35kb.

Negative 80035 pPart of my software build process includes getting the hash of the working directory parent into a C string for inclusion in the version output.

I want to auto populate the edittext but I think I could figure out how to do that with a quick google search. So if I could just store it the coords to a variable that would be all I want but my brain is not working.

Negative 80035 pAre there any specific reasons to use a Date class in an API for example, in an employee birth date field rather that a long or Long. p  pThere is some discussion of this in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1404210javadatevscalendar20javadatevscalendarjavadatevscalendara, but I would like to know specifically if there is any justification for using Dates, when a long or Long seems so much simpler. p  pOf course I would use TimeZone and SimpleDateFormatter to parse and display dates in a GUI, and maybe Calendar to perform manipulations, but I am concerned only about the storage and representation of date in the data modelAPI in this question.p  pstrongUpdatestrong An example of one reason why I would not choose Date is that it is mutable. So if I expose a Date in my API, callers can call setTimelong and this seems to be a violation of basic encapsulation. To me this seems to outweigh the benefit of the added clarity that using a Date provides, since I could just call the long property timeInMillisecondsSinceEpoch and communicate the same information to callers.p

Negative 80035 pIm wondering how the delete[] operators works with pointers emreturnedem by a function, rather then having the dynamic allocation in the same scope as the delete statement.  Lets say I have a trivial function like thisp  precodeint getArray      int returnVal  new int[3]     returnVal[0]  returnVal[1]  returnVal[2]  0     return returnVal  codepre  pNow, when I need to use that array in my code, I would do the followingp  precodeint vals  getArray  use values... delete[] vals codepre  pHowever, Im wondering, how does the C compiler know how big the memory block that was allocated was and thus how many memory elements to delete from codevalscode  Is this a valid technique, or would I have to delete each array value individually like in the code belowp  precodeint vals  getArray  use values... delete vals  2 delete vals  1 delete vals codepre

Negative 80035 pI am new to RESTful web services and RESTlet. WE only have experience building servlet based web applications ServletJSP on JBossApache. Now, we are building a RESTlet based application where the server side API would be used by two types of clients  web using browser and swing based via desktop. p  pWhat I understand is that as per REST concepts a server can not maintain sessions to improve scalability and few other reasons  b each request from client should be selfcontained p  pNow, I am really confused how to achieve this. Suppose we take a simple shopping cart application. p  pStep 1 Client sends the authentication request, server authenticates and server responds OK. p  pStep 2 Client sends a request to add an item to the shopping cart. Server responds OK.p  pStep 3 Client sends another request to add 2nd item to the shopping card. Server responds OK.p  pNormally, in a normally web app, a session is created in Step 1 on server and from that point onwards all the requests pertaining to that client are automatically associated with the same session and we store session state Shopping Cart in this case in the session object and retrieveupdate it with subsequent requests from the client. p  pNow, in the above scenariop  p1 how do we authenticate and authorize Client in Step 2 and 3 if there is no session maintained on the server  p  p2 does client need to send some additional information with each request p  p3 How do we retrieve the client specific Shopping Cart in Step 3 p  p4 Does the client need to send its Shopping Cart that was createdreturned by server in Step 2 again in Step 3  p  pObviously, this is the simplest use case and so every one developing RESTful web services must be designing their app to handle this. What is the best and most common way to handle session management, authentication, authorization in RESTful web services using RESTLet  If we have to maintain cache on server side with the clients data then how is this different from server maintaining sessions on our behalf p  pThanks in advance, Deepp

The Android developer docs contain a tutorial on how to implement a ListView and I also managed to change the ListItemlayout to contain the checkbox and two TextViews.p  pThe list looks just how it should, but when I check a checkbox, every seventeenth or so checkbox is checked, too. It looks like the ListView stores the values of the checkboxes pagewise, so that when the values are changed on one page, they change on every page.p  pLooking for a workaround, I discovered that one could use codeandroid.R.layout.simplelistitemmultiplechoicecode instead of a custom layout  which indeed works fine, but contains only one TextView and is therefore useless for me.

Negative 80035 pNow this is a tricky problem for which Im not able to figure out a good solution. Suppose we have a String in Java He ate 3 apples today.

How can I identify that three is actually a number I used OpenNlp and used its POS tagger but the time it takes to do is really too much Can anyone suggest a better solution for this Also among the .bin of OpenNlp, there is one filenum.bin, but I dont know how to use this file. OpenNlp documentation also say nothing about it. Can anyone tell me if this is exactly what Ive been looking for, and if yes then how to use it.p  pstrongememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememstrong Im actually short of time here, so Ive settled on a temporary solution here. Make a filedictionary and take all the entries in a hashtable. Then Ill tokenize my sentence and check word by word for numbers, similar to what you guys suggested. Ill keep on updating the file as and when required. Thanks for your valuable suggestions guys, and if you have got something better than this Id be really glad. OpenNlp implements this in a very good way, the only problem with it is time complexity and I want to do this in minimum time possible.p

Negative 80035 pIm trying to implement an ACO for 01MKP. My input values are from the ORLibrary mknap1.txt. According to my algorithm, first I choose an item randomly. then i calculate the probabilities for all other items on the construction graph. the probability equation depends on pheremon level and the heuristic information.p  precodep[i]tau[i]n[i]tau[i]n[i].  codepre  pmy pheremon matrixs cells have a constant value at initial 0.2. for this reason when i try to find the next item to go, pheremon matrix is becomes ineffective because of 0.2. so, my probability function determines the next item to go, checking the heuristic information. As you know, the heuristic information equation is p  precoden[i]profit[i]Ravg.  codepre  pRavg is the average of the resource constraints. for this reason my prob. functions chooses the item which has biggest profit value. Lets say at first iteration my algorithm selected an item randomly which has 600 profit. then at the second iteration, chooses the 2400 profit value. But, in ORLibrary, the item which has 2400 profit value causes the resource violation. Whatever I do, the second chosen is being the item which has 2400 profit.p  pis there anything wrong my algorithm I hope ppl who know somethings about ACO, should help me.

Negative 80035 pRight now I am designing an architecture that has a middle tier feeding a front end client. The data being fed is not complex and will probably be a few lines of comma delimited data. However, I need the client to get this data every second. The data can be obtained by sending a simple tcp message to the middle tier server.p  pThe problem is I need this to work in all browsers including IE 8. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make a lightweight front end that can get this data every second and display it in a modern browser I know browsers have web sockets now but IE 8 doesnt so that kind of leaves them out. Ive been looking into Comet, node.jssocket.io, or possibly a RubyRails application Im kind of lost here so any suggestions would be great. Thanksp

Negative 80035 pOkay, I have two view page in Total. I am using area in this project. In the first view page, I have View and Partial view which is working fine. From the first View Page, the user click the submit button and the controllers action get called. In the return of the action method, I return RedirectToActionController,ActionName, TempData[Model]. So it direct to the action Name and in the front end it still goes back to the first View. How can I make to go to the second view page since the Action Name of the RedirectToAction returns the second View Page. please help me, Hope you understand my question. Here is the code snippet.

How can i code to achieve to go to the second view page . And another problem is that since I am using Area, for links like Home and About, it is working fine at first. But after you clicked the areas clink, then if you link the Home link, it wont work any more, Because it remembers the areas name can append to the Home link. Is there any tip to overcome this problem please help me asap. Thanks.p
Negative 80035 pI am working on a rails application that requires files to be uploaded to my server and then have resque workers running on several other computers use those files to do some tasks. I have my workers all set to do the task but I cant seem to find a nice way to get the files from my host computer to my worker computers. Ive tried Carrierwave and looked the documentation for Paperclip, but all I see is using S3 which I cannot use.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what might be best way to do this Thank youp  hr  pUpdatep  pI should also note the files that need to be shared are roughly 200MB eachp

Negative 80035 pIve been planning an indie game project for a while now. Ill summarise it for you so I can get right to the question.p  pIts done entirely using the latest version of XNA through Visual Studio. Hoping to put it on 360 and PC, but am only really looking for a PCoriented solution at this stage.p  pIts a 2D sidescrolling shooter think Metroidvaniastyle, or even Terraria. It will eventually include an ingame map editor with maps being tilebased 16x16. There will be upwards and downwards scrolling. Im hoping to implement tile layers in the dev map editor reason for a dev map editor is its going to be heavily leaning towards a contentfocus, so there will be a lot of maps. p  pPhysical tiles will be very simple with only two major types. Block tiles, which are just a solid tile, and angled tiles, which are tiles with an incline that characters can walk on. Im strongly considering abandoning angled tiles entirely, but not sure yet.p  pThe characterNPC movement will be simple. Moving sidetoside, jumping, falling, flying with appropriate itemssituations, teleporting. All very static, no dynamic physics necessary. Only basic gravity. When a character steps off the edge of a tile, it falls. When it jumps and a tile is above it, it stops short and falls back down. When it reaches a protruding tilewall, it cant move further unless it jumps over or flies. All the basic stuff.p  pProjectiles can be affected by gravity as well, and some situations may arise where a projectile may be manipulated midflight, but nothing requiring heavy physics. Some projectiles will move characters as well think a simple pushing mechanic. p  pstrongSo heres the questionstrong Im at the stage where Im starting to work on movement and collisiondetection but I just cant set myself on a way to go about them. I need ways to determine when character, tiles, and projectiles collide. Given what Ive said about the style Im going for and the tilebased system Im using, strongcan I get some recommendationslinks to some tried and true collision detection methods others have used in similar situationsstrong What I need more than anything else is inspiration.p  pemAnd just a quick note, I have several years of experience as a programmer, so Im not a total newbie emp

Negative 80035 pMySQL uses a function HEX which will convert a sequence of characters to hexidecimal representation. The only problem is that it assumes each character is twobytes. This is fine for most cases, but with utf8 there are sometimes characters that span more than 2bytes.p  pFor example. 0xEFBFBD is the three byte character used to signal an encoding error. When I have two of these character one after the other in the DB 6 bytes in total, in a utf8 encoded table, and I try SELECT HEXcol1 FROM table ..., this comes out as 0xC3AFC2BFC2BD rather than 0xEFBFBD. If I select it using a query in php, and then convert is to hex within php, it comes through as the correct format.p  pWhat would be the best is a function is MySql which can decode proper, multibyte UTF8. Im very surprised that it appears not to exists and would like to know if anyone else has found this to be the case also and possible workarounds.p  pThe closest thing Ive found to an answer in MySql is a hrefhttpforums.mysql.comread.php103,375304,375660 relnofollowhttpforums.mysql.comread.php103,375304,375660ap  pbut this advice doesnt really help.

Negative 80035 pI am building a Java Swing gui and I am wondering what the best way of managing all my images would be. So far I have just been creating images from different classes whenever they are needed, by pointing out the path of each one, for examplep  precodeImageIcon temp new ImageIconresourcespicturestemp.png codepre  pThere are 2 things I dont like. First thing would be having all those paths. Second would be that I would prefer a more like central repository approach. Does anyone have a better practice to suggest, I was thinking maybe something like an ImageManager that loads all the images at the very start of a program. Can property files help somehow never used them with all those pathsp  pThanksp

Negative 80035 pI have a UIButton and I am adding a subview to the UIButton which is a UILabel. When I tap on the UILabel the action of the button doesnt get triggered. Is there an easy fix so that the touch event gets passed to the UIButton when the UILabel is tapped I am thinking of adding a gesture recognizer to the UILabel which then triggers the action of the UIButton, not sure if theres a much more simpler way.p
Negative 80035 pI recently switched from visual basic 5 to visual basic .NET and Im trying to learn WPF converting an old program from Windows Forms written using visual basic 5 to WPFampVB.NET.p  pIn the old program I have a combobox with information loaded from an access database a simple table with itemid and itemdescription.

Negative 80035 pIm interested to know if anyone has done any work in JQuery Mobile with classic ASP. It seems that PHP is a widely used serverside language with JQM but I cant seem to find anything with good ol CLASP I know its old tech, but its similarities to PHP are quite interesting. I have a long history with classic asp and would like to use that as opposed to learning PHP if I avoid it.p  pHere are the details ...p  pI have an existing SQL database on my server with customer information that I want to simply list in JQM. It would be a three page app Page1  Logon user authentication Page2  customer listing based on the customers associated in the database with the users credentials Page3  customer details  details of the selected customer from Page2p  pWhen the user submits the logon form, the app goes to the server and gets credentials. Those credentials are then used on Page2 to list the customers that have the users ID as the account manager. The user then clicks a customer, and the customerID is passed to the customer details page which is used to pull specific customer data from the database.p  pThe main difficulties I am having are  . the connection the SQL server database. How does javascript connect to the serverside and retrieve data AJAX, JSON, web service . how do I pass data from page to page Credentials from the logon form, customer ID to the customer details page.p  pMy preference would be to use ASP, with AJAXJSON calls to populate the serverside data but I dont know where to start. Any assistance would be much appreciated. I would be happy to give some advertising space on my blog to anyone who can give a welldetailed explanation.p  pThanks Steven w a hrefhttpwww.stevenwoolston.com relnofollowhttpwww.stevenwoolston.comap
Negative 80035 pWhile running tests with Maven I have encountered a NoClassDefFoundError, caused by ClassNotFoundException. The class which was not found definitely exists in my local repository. p  pThe problematic dependency looks like this a default scoped dependency depends on a jar which scope is a marked as provided, and the file which was not found by the classloader is located inside that jar. It compiles ok, by the file cannot be found while runnig the app. p  pI have fixed the error by adding that provided jar explicitely to my pom as a runtimescoped dependency, but I want to understand whats going on.p  p1 What is the meaning of dependency scope  provided if I am running some tests I understand that a servlet container can have some provided jars, such as servletapi.jar, but what about tests This looks like an error in our pom, isnt it Is there any other case except from servletapi.jar and similair webserver jars when we should use the provided scopep  p2 I tried to use a maven commandline parameter U while looking for the solution of this problem. As far as I understand, it forces Maven to check the remote repository and take most fresh the dependencies from there if necessary.  A question is whats going on if I am not specifying this command It will always get the outdated dependencies from local repository If not, then why I need this commandp  p3 For solving issues like this it is good to know which jars are really on classpath when compiling the code, and which are there when running the code. Is it possible with Mavenp

They work within the scope of the form page but then do not always carry over back to the main page. I thought this might be because they were not actually accessing the right session, but it seems all session variables outside the form page can be accessed within the form page.p  pSo I am stumped.

Negative 80035 pIve been recently trying out springtestmvc since using the handlerAdapter and handlerMapping objects in the application context no longer support session attributes when you pass objects in that way like they used to in Spring 3.0.p  pIs there any way to ease the coding of these tests from IntelliJ IDEA Having to import so many static methods is rather timeconsuming, and to be honest, I preferred my older method of testing a lot more but I can no longer do it that way in 3.1. Is there any way to tell IntelliJ IDEA If I type codegetcode, automatically import that method statically p  pAre there any other alternatives to springtestmvc that are easier to code against but also test request mappings in addition to controller logic I also need to support session attributes.p  pIn addition to the weird syntax of writing tests in springtestmvc, it seems really odd to pass in session attributes into the controller. They seem to encourage creating an object constructor where you pass the session objects in that way... but I dont want to make this constructor on my controllers when it is not used during production. Thats gotta be a testing antipattern, but I dont see any other way to pass in a session object as part of the request and their examples encourage making this object constructor.p  pThanksp

Negative 80035 pIn my code, I have the following codestructcodep  precodestruct foo   int a  int b  codepre  pIn codebcode, only values between 0 and 100 are stored. So in general, I could replace it by a codecharcode. But than the size of the codestructcode is the same due to padding effects. As my code contains codevectorscode and codesetscode of these structure with several million entries, it would bring the memory usage down by more than one third if I could circumvent padding in some way. Is there any possibility to do this, e.g. some other boost data container which behaves in the same wayp  pEdit I use both, the GNU and the Intel compiler on Linux systemsp

Negative 80035 pSo Im trying add malloc to a phonebook application that I created, but since Im kind of new to C Im not sure if what Im doing is correct. Ive run into a small problem, but Ive read through the beginner book that I have, and it doesnt go though as much detail as I would like, I cant tell by searching Google if Im just completely wrong in how I set up the malloc or if there is something else I missed. p  pBasically what Ive got are 4 arrays in my structure, codeFirstNamecode, codeLastnamecode,codehomecode,codecellcode. Each one of these have 2 functions, a function that gets the info from the user and a function that prints and adds the user info to the phonebook. What Ive got right now is a small snipit of the original code that only adds the first name to the phonebookso its not the entire code and in each function that gets the user input, I want to add the malloc function.

Negative 80035 pI would like to know if I am on the right track and if rails allows this sort of thing.p  pcodeUsercode has one codeRolecode in a codeNetworkcode. i.e. Jim is a History Teacher at a School.p  pA codeRolecode has both a position power and a name label. Jim is a History Teacher label but has the authority of a member or admin, or supervisor, or whatever power.p  pDepending on that codeRolecode a codeUsercode can see all codeEventscode in the codeNetworkcode whether or not heshe created them. i.e. Jim can see Nancys Recess Plan if Jim is a Principal admin but not if Jim is a History Teacher member.p  pA codeUsercode creates an codeEventcode as a codeRolecode within a codeNetworkcode. i.e. Jim creates Lesson Plan as History Teacher at School.p  pcodeEventcode is forever connected to that specific codeNetworkcode and currently to that codeRolecode.p  pI want that codeEventcode to persist if a codeUsercode replaces another codeUsercode in that codeRolecode, and the new codeUsercode can access that codeEventcode. i.e. Tom replaces Jim as the History Teacher and can modify Lesson Plan because he is the History Teacher. Jim can no longer access Lesson Plan.p  pBut I also want an codeEventcode to persist if there is no codeUsercode attached to a codeRolecode. i.e. Tom is fired and there is no current replacement, an admin can still see Lesson Plan.p  pFinally, if that codeRolecode is deleted, the codeEventcode still exists as connected to that codeNetworkcode without a codeRolecode.p  pThe models are below, I am using CanCan for authorization, and these are my questionsp  ol liCan a role be missing a codeUsercode, or would I need to create some generic None codeUsercode or Everyone codeUsercode And can codeEventcode be missing a codeRolecode Can belongsto be nullli liIs it goodbad design to connect an codeEventcode to both a codeRolecode and a codeNetworkcode Is there a better way to do thisli liIf a codeUsercode can see more events depending on hisher codeRolecode do they have many codeEventscode through the codeNetworkcode or their codeRolecode I am thinking through codeNetworkcode and the Ability.rb would limit it.li ol  pUser.rbp  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany roles   hasmany networks, through gt roles    hasmany events, through gt network    I would use CanCan to determine the authorization of    what network events they can see based on their role end codepre  pNetwork.rbp  precodeclass Network lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany roles   hasmany users, through gt roles    hasmany events    it shouldnt have this through roles right    because a role can be deleted end codepre  pRole.rbp  precodeclass Role lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto user     CAN THIS BE NULL   belongsto network end codepre  pEvent.rbp  precodeclass Event lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto role      Can this be null    belongs to network    Does it belong to the network through the role,    or can it belong on its own, in case the role is deleted     belongsto user, through gt roles    Is this necessary if I am using CanCan    to determine if a User can reach the event  end codepre  pAbility.rbp  precodeif user     user.roles.each do role     can manage, Event, roleid gt role.id     if role.position  admin  role.position  manager       can manage, Event, networkid gt role.networkid     elseif role.position  supervisor       can read, Event, networkid gt role.networkid     end   end end codepre

Negative 80035 pIm new at signal handling in Unix through C and I have been looking at some tutorials on it out of pure interest.p  pMy questions is, is it possible to continue execution of a program past the point where a signal is handledp  pI understand that the signal handling function does the cleanup but in the spirit of exception handling such as in C, is it possible for that signal to be handled in the same fashion and for the program to continue running normallyp  pAt the moment codecatchcode goes in an infinite loop presumably a way to quit would be to call codeexit1code . p  pMy intention would be for codebcode to be assigned 1 and for the program to finish gracefully if that is possible of course.p  pHeres my codep  precodeinclude ltsignal.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int a  5 int b  0  void catchint sig      printfCaught the signal, will handle it nown     b  1   int mainvoid      signalSIGFPE, catch      int c  a  b      return 0  codepre  pAlso, as C is procedural, how come the signal handler declared before the offending statement is actually called after the latter has executedp  pAnd finally, in order for the handling function to do its clean up properly, all the variables than need to be cleaned up in the event of an exception need to be declared prior to the function, rightp  pThanks in advance for your answers and apologies if some of the above is very obvious.p

Negative 80035 pI was reading about algorithmic problem and one was the following   p  blockquote   pHaving a file with millions of lines of data, there are 2 lines which   are identical. The lines are so long that may not fit in memory. Find   the 2 identical lines.p blockquote  pThe solution suggested was to read lines in parts and create hashes for each line.br E.g. you build the hash for line 1 by building the hash of part1 of line 1 which can be read in memory and then hash of part2 of line 1 up to partN of line 1.br Store the hashes in file or hashtable. For any same hash values compare the lines. If the lines are the same we solved it.  p  pAlthough I understand this solution in high level, I have no idea how this could be implemented. How can we associate a hash with a specific line in file Is this language implementation detailbr E.g. in Java how would we address thisp

But, in doing that, the contents of the window are scaled again.p  pBasically what ends up happening is with anything over 100, or the minWidth amp minHeight, components inside the window end up clipping with parts appearing cut off because the stage.stageWidth is not as wide as the stage.width and stage.stageHeight is not as tall as the stage.height.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltsWindow xmlnsfxhttpns.adobe.commxml2009            xmlnsslibraryns.adobe.comflexspark            xmlnsmxlibraryns.adobe.comflexmx width250 height300           minWidth260 minHeight280           showStatusBarfalse           systemChromenone transparenttrue           initializeinit creationCompleteinitPostCreation           maximizablefalse minimizablefalse xmlnsComponentsassets.skins.CompOverlay.Components.gt      ltfxDeclarationsgt     ltfxDeclarationsgt      ltsVGroup left2 top2 right2 bottom2 gap0gt                 ltsLabel width100 textAligncenter textWindow Scale fontSize14 gt         ltsHGroup width100gt             ltsHSlider idwinScale minimum0.6 maximum2 width80 snapInterval0.01 showDataTipfalse changewinScaleevent gt             ltsLabel width20 fontSize14 textAligncenter textMath.roundwinScale.value100  gt         ltsHGroupgt          ltsVGroupgt      ltfxScriptgt         lt[CDATA[             import mx.events.ResizeEvent              private function initvoid                                         private function initPostCreationvoid                              this.addEventListenerEvent.CLOSING, this.destructor                  this.stage.scaleMode  StageScaleMode.NOSCALE                 this.stage.addEventListenerEvent.RESIZE, onResize                 this.addEventListenerResizeEvent.RESIZE, onWinResize                 this.stage.align  StageAlign.TOPLEFT                           private function destructoreventEventvoid                                             this.removeEventListenerEvent.CLOSING, this.destructor                 this.stage.removeEventListenerEvent.RESIZE, onResize                 this.removeEventListenerResizeEvent.RESIZE, onWinResize                           private function winScaleeventEventvoid                              this.scaleX  event.target.value                 this.scaleY  this.scaleX                 this.width  260this.scaleX                 this.height  300this.scaleY                 tracethis.width, this.height                 tracethis.scaleX, this.scaleY                           private function onResizeeventEventvoid                              tracestart resize                 tracestage.width  this.stage.width, stage.height  this.stage.height                 tracestage.stageWidth  this.stage.stageWidth, stage.stageHeight  this.stage.stageHeight                 if this.initialized                      if this.stage.width  this.stage.stageWidth                          this.stage.removeEventListenerEvent.RESIZE, onResize                          this.stage.stageWidth  this.stage.width                         this.stage.stageHeight  this.stage.height                          this.stage.addEventListenerEvent.RESIZE, onResize                                          tracestage.width  this.stage.width, stage.height  this.stage.height                     tracestage.stageWidth  this.stage.stageWidth, stage.stageHeight  this.stage.stageHeight                     tracestage.scaleX  this.stage.scaleX, stage.scaleY  this.stage.scaleY                                  traceend resize                           private function onWinResizeeventResizeEventvoid                              trace window resize event                 if this.stage.width  this.stage.stageWidth                      event.stopPropagation                     traceprop stopped                                        ]]gt     ltfxScriptgt ltsWindowgt codepre  pResizing the window a few times results in this trace outputp  precodestart resize stage.width  291.5 stage.height  316.9 stage.stageWidth  275 stage.stageHeight  297 window resize event prop stopped window resize event prop stopped stage.width  308.45 stage.height  337.05 stage.stageWidth  291 stage.stageHeight  316 stage.scaleX  1 stage.scaleY  1 stage.scaleMode  noScale end resize window resize event prop stopped start resize stage.width  308.45 stage.height  339.2 stage.stageWidth  291 stage.stageHeight  318 window resize event prop stopped window resize event prop stopped stage.width  326.5 stage.height  361.45 stage.stageWidth  308 stage.stageHeight  339 stage.scaleX  1 stage.scaleY  1 stage.scaleMode  noScale end resize codepre  pI appreciate any help, thanksp

Negative 80035 pI am running into a problem that has been discussed on here before getting a codeJScrollPanecode containing a codeJTablecode to display the horizontal scrollbar as I desire.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2452694jtablehorizontalscrollbarinjavaHEREa is a post I tried following, but for some reason it does not seem to work with my situation I think it is because Ive set one of my columns to have a fixed width.p  pHere is a SSCCEp  precodeimport javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.JTable import javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel  SuppressWarningsserial public class TableScrollTest extends JFrame      public TableScrollTest           DefaultTableModel model  new DefaultTableModelnew Object[]key, value,0         model.addRownew Object[]short, blah         model.addRownew Object[]long, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah          JTable table  new JTablemodel              public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportWidth                  return getPreferredSize.width lt getParent.getWidth                                       table.getColumnkey.setPreferredWidth60         table.getColumnkey.setMinWidth60         table.getColumnkey.setMaxWidth60         table.setAutoResizeMode JTable.AUTORESIZEOFF           JScrollPane scrollPane  new JScrollPane table          getContentPane.add scrollPane            public static void mainString[] args          TableScrollTest frame  new TableScrollTest         frame.setDefaultCloseOperation EXITONCLOSE          frame.pack         frame.setSize200, 200         frame.setResizablefalse         frame.setVisibletrue       codepre  pIn short, I have a two column table for displaying keyvalue pairs.  The container holding the table is of fixed width, and the first column of the table is also of fixed width since I know how long all the key names will be.  The second column will contain values of varying string length.  A horizontal scrollbar should only appear when there are values present which are too long to fit in the width allotted for the column.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comygPIs8W.png altenter image description herep  pBecause the second value above has such a long length, the scrollbar should be visible.  However, its not, and everything I have tried has only succeeded in getting it visible always, which is not what I want... I only want it visible if long values are present.  It seems like the codegetScrollableTracksViewportWidthcode method being overridden in the table constructor checks what the preferred width of the table is... so somehow I need to direct the table to prefer a larger width based on the contents of that second column only... but Im stumped.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 80035 pIm very new to using git, and previously havent really tried to organize any projects Ive worked on. I just recently purchased a development server for personal use, however, and I wanted to start organizing all my projects and using version control.p  pIve spent the past 8 hours researching different recommended methods for organizing files in a project, and I realize that its a very subjective matter. However Ive developed a system that I think will work for just about any cause for me and I have one very objective question in regards to how to accomplish a certain task with the directory structure.p  pPresently Im looking into a structure akin to the followingp  precodesrc  All deliverables in an uncompiled form PHP files, c source files, etc data  Crucial but unrelated data SQL databases, etc. lib  Dependencies  THIS IS WHERE MY QUESTION LIES docs  Documentation build  Scripts to aide in the build process test  Unit tests res  Not version controlled. Contains PSD files and nondiffable stuff .gitignore README output.zip  Readytoinstall finished product just unzip and go codepre  pAs I mentioned  my real issue revolves around this codelibcode directory. This needs to contain all files and programs which my project requires to run, but which are outside of the scope of my project and I wont be editing. Some features that I need this folder to havep  ul liSince these are needed for my final product to run, they must be included in output.zipli liI would like this folder to be version controlled so that anyone who downloads my git repository will have access to all dependenciesli liIf several projects have the same dependency, I do NOT want to have 18 redundant copies of the same file on my serverli liI would like to be able to pull these dependencies from other projects of mine one project should be able to serve as a library for a separate projectli ul  pI can avoid having 18 redundant copies of the same file by using a virtual directory symlink, however from my understanding git would copy this symlink asis into the repository without copying the files. Therefore if anyone else fetched my repository they would have a dangling pointer and no libraries.p  pAt first it looked like I could do what I wanted using a hrefhttpswww.kernel.orgpubsoftwarescmgitdocsgitsubmodule.html relnofollowgitsubmodulea. However from my understanding this takes the entire contents of another repository and treats it as a subdirectory. Therefore if I included dependency A my libraries folder would look something likep  precodelibAsrc libAdata ... libAtest .gitignore README output.zip codepre  pIn the case of a script PHP, Perl, etc. I could probably load the dependency using coderequirelibAsrcdependency.phpcode, but in the case of a DLL or binary file I would have no easy way to read the output file from output.zip. I could have the finished project stored directly at the root level instead of wrapped up in a pretty zip file, but if the project were, say, a website  this could mean hundreds of files cluttering up my repository root.p  pHow can I include another repository as a library of my own, easily reference the library files within my own project, have the library meaningfully copied to anyone who fetches my repository, and prevent redundant copies of the same files on my development serverp  pstrongEDITstrong After searching on Google for a while I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5461617usinggitandsubmodulewhatsagoodfolderstructurethis similar issuea, however it only addresses PHP projects. While an autoloader may allow you to mask the underlying file system in a PHP environment, how would you apply a similar approach to a C project Or a Python project Or a Java projectp  pAs I thought more about this project today a few other thoughts came to mind which may require a new direction of thought. First is the problem of very deep library nests. If project A depends on project B which depends on project C which depends on project D then you would have a directory structure like sop  precodeAlib AlibB AlibBlib AlibBlibC AlibBlibClib AlibBlibClibD codepre  pObviously this would not only get annoying, but redundant in its own way.p  pHow do normal people deal with dependencies when doing a git repositoryp

Negative 80035 pIts a bit odd asking this question, because I have code that seems like it shouldnt work, but it does, and although Im not complaining, Id like to confirm why LOLp  pSimply, I have a C native DLL no CLRmanaged support at all that takes a callback from C code.  The native side stores an stdcall callback function, which is supplied by the C side.  I always thought the callback METHOD in C had to be static, but nonstatic and lambda expression BOTH work JUST FINE  How is the this pointer being marshaled from native code  I always thought that native code only stores noninstance function pointersp  pNow, I did find an article where some guy emitted IL code to bridge between native and nonstatic managed callbacks.  I also noticed this depreciated method Marshal.GetUnmanagedThunkForManagedMethodPtr.  The method is no longer supported, which Im assuming means it is built inp  pQuestion summaryp  ol lipIs thunking now built natively into .NET by emitting IL code If so, at what version of .NET did this become natively supportedpli lipIs implicit thunking supported in Mono as wellpli lipWhen the IL is emitted for the managed callbacks, what happens when the instance the thunk refers to is deleted Is the IL removed, or might this lead to a memory leak so to speakpli ol  pThanks.p

And, I suppose, the Cloudfront distribution should not enable any kind of cache.p

However, anything that I place on the View of this VC in my Storyboard doesnt show up  if I dont colour the View programatically, the screen is black. p  pThe second way I tried because I thought that the code wasnt connecting to my Storyboard properly its an older method that still works with XIBs afaik. It looks like thisp  precodeUIStoryboard storyboard  [UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameMainStoryboardiPhone bundlenil] SecondViewController secondView  SecondViewController  [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifiersecondView] [self.navigationController pushViewControllersecondView animatedYES] codepre  p... but neither the viewDidLoad nor the interface seem to respondget called.p  pI also looked at a codeprepareForSeguecode method, but Im not sure if its going to make a difference, as Im pretty sure theres something Im missing...p  pI should note that I have set the Storyboard ID of the ViewController under the Identity Inspector.p  pIf anyone can explain both the immediate solution to my problem andor a larger explanation of the issue Im experiencing, that would be greatly appreciated.p  p Jessep

Negative 80035 pI want to have functions in Excel Taking ExcelArguments that call RFunctions and return the results back to Excel.

Negative 80035 pI have a simple client application which sends udp datagram to the server with known ip address and port and waits for respond. Client can be started on any computer or mobile device and it can be located behind several routers and firewalls... Server application listens  certain port for clients datagram and replies to the clients endpoint with an answer. Server application works on windows computer with properly configured firewall, etc. So, as I understand, this simple scheme should work regardless to clients location and his firewall settings. But it looks like it doesnt work in about 75 of configurations. Server receives request from the client in 100 of cases, but in 75 of cases client cant receive response from the server, i.e. it looks like its always blocked by something server attempts 10 times to send an answer to the client, but without luck, i.e. client doesnt receive anything. I tried many different configurations of client computers to figure out the reasons of these issues and what Ive foundp  ol lipIn some cases simple windows firewall can block respond packets But how it could be possible As I understand, all respond packets must be forwarded back to the client regardless to firewall settings.pli lipSome Hardware firewalls or NATs also can block respond UDP packets. And again, I cant understand why it could be possiblepli ol  pThe question is  is there any reliable method to deliver an answer to client As I know, many programs, such as Skype works fine with UDP even with all these network obstacles.p  pThank youp
Negative 80035 pWhen a user logs into the system Im building, I need to get the user by username in order top  ol liSee if the user existsli liSee if the hashed password for that user matches what the user enteredli ol  pThe problem is that I only have the username and password at that point. It seems silly to have to ask for last name or anything else I might use as the partition key. p  pThat being said, I know that its a bad idea to search by rowkey only and Im not even sure if you can using the TableOperation.RetrievepartitionKey, rowKey method Ive tried passing null as the partition key but Azure politely says no.p  pDoes anyone have a good idea What have you all been doing in this scenariop  pthanks, Colin p
Negative 80035 pIm working on a support app which would allow customers to mail to supportmyapp.com and reply to this same email address. I have set up ticket[id]myapp.com to be visible within the support team whenever theres a new ticket created. I am using Cloudmailin for the incoming emails and SendGrid for outgoing. p  pI want to be able to store the ticket ID in the email headers of the email that is sent to the customer from supportmyapp.com. When the customer replies to supportmyapp.com, the app will then read the headers and know which ticket ID to route to. I have read up that it is not recommended to include Xcustom headers as it would get stripped off by some mail servers. p  pThere are some suggestions to use the ReplyTo header to store the ticket ID but I cant seem to find that header in Cloudmailin.p  pAppreciate any suggestion on this matter.p

Negative 80035 pI have a tough question for me at least.  Im working on a Windows Service written in VB.net.  Im using a System.Timers.Timer class to periodically call a delegate method to see if there is any work to do.  The timing of the processing is not critical and I have attempted to prevent reentry into the worker method by disabling the Timer as soon as the method is invoked and starting it again at the end.p  pHowever, the Timer class Elapsed events occur on a different thread.  Searching online, most people are using Windows forms which implement the ISynchronize interface to marshal the call back to the originating thread.  Ideally I dont want to use Windows Forms to achieve this.  Is there an easy way to redirect the call back to the original threadp  pAlternatively is there a framework class I can inherit to do this  Or at worst a simple implementation of ISynchronizep  precodeImports System.Timers Imports System.IO Imports System.Data   Public Class Application     Implements IDisposable   Private WithEvents Timer As Timer    Private Sub SleepTimerCallbacksender As Object, e As ElapsedEventArgs Handles Timer.Elapsed       TODO need to find a way to bring this method back on the main thread.       Temporarily disable the timer elapsed event so that we dont have event reentrance.     If Me.Timer.Enabled  True Then Me.Timer.Enabled  False       Do Work.       Reenable the timer elapsed event.     Timer.Enabled  True  End Sub  End Class codepre

So when a user FIRST connect to my server which the server provides mechanism for user authentication, the server receives limitedlife access token and ONETIME refresh token. After 1 hour, the access token is expired.p  pSpecific question Here comes to the key questions. After the expiration, my server stills send request to the Google Drive Api with the EXPIRED access token and refresh token Server uses session to store those values. Will this still be able to access the content in Google Drive What I am guessing is that the nodejs lib  google drive api is SMART enough to detect the access token is expired amp refresh token is identified amp api replace the expired access token with new access token blindly like server does not need to do anything just google drive api. Will the api response the server with a new Access Codep  pI need to figure this out because I need to organize my code in Nodejs effectively. p  pThanksp

Negative 80035 pToday I came a cross an issue with a binary I created from some python scripts using pyinstaller. I created the binary on fc17 but when I tried to run it on fc18 I got an error which was related to a difference in the openssl version on fc17 1.0.0k and fc18 1.0.1e. This raises serious doubts about my ability to use pyinstaller since I dont know in advance on which Linux distributions my binary will end up. Im willing to build the binary once every time I make a change in the python scripts but I can not afford having every possible Linux distribution and building the binary on every one of them. Is there a recipe to handle the variety of Linux distributions when building an application with pyinstallerp

Negative 80035 pI had the following problem with our Oracle 11 database and although theres a fix, I want to understand why its reacting this way.p  pWe have two schemas a dev schema which contains all the tables, views, plsql, ... and a app schema which contains synonyms to the devobjects, i.e. statements dont contain schema names.p  pA devview references tables codeselect  from a a1 gt b gt a a2 union select  from ccode in which theres a common column which is used for the selection, i.e. the selection predicate is pushed into table a 300k rows and b 90k rows selection via seperate index access, resulting in a very performant plan.p  pdevfun is a deterministic, parallel function which simply does some string manipulation without further database access.p  pThe selection on the view looks like codeselect  from view where commoncolumn  funstringcode This works as expected on the dev schema, but if this is executed on the app schema, the plan becomes relatively very expensive, i.e. the result of codefunstringcode is not pushed down, but the tables are hash joined and the result is scanned for the element.p  pStill in the app schema, when I replace codefunstringcode with the functionresult the plan becomes cheap again.p  pTo solve the problem, I duplicated the view in the app schema instead of referencing it via a synonym, but in case of viewtablechanges that means a potential source of defect, as we normally dont check the app schema ... The call to the function is still via the synonym and the view was duplicated asis, i.e. it accesses the synonyms for the underlying tables ... and the plan is the same as if it was executed on the dev schema.p  pApart of having selection grants on all underlying tables, Ive also tried granting query rewrite, references on the tables and references on the view. Furthermore Ive tried the authidoptions on the function.

Negative 80035 pJust a quick question, I know that when looking up entries in a dictionary theres a fast efficient way of doing itp  pAssuming the dictionary is ordered in some way using codecollections.OrderedDictcode You start at the middle of the dictionary, and find whether the desired key is off to one half or another, such as when testing the position of a name in an alphabetically ordered dictionary or in rare cases dead on. You then check the next half, and continue this pattern until the item is found meaning that with a dictionary of 1000000 keys you could effectively find any key within 20 iterations of this algorithm.p  pSo I was wondering, if I were to use an codeincode statement i.e. codeif a in somedictcode, would it use this same method of checking for the desired key Does it use a fasterslower algorithmp

pLike 3,6,12,7,1,4p  pherep  precode 14s sum0 with wastage0   And combination0  16s sum1 with wastage0   And combination12,4  18s sum1 with wastage1   And combination3,6,7,1  Total Wastage1 codepre  pAnd Other can bep  precode 14s sum0 with wastage0   And combination0  16s sum1 with wastage1   And combination3,7,1,4  18s sum1 with wastage0   And combination12,6  Total Wastage1 codepre  pI thinks Its best.p  pAnd can be Other Combination with greater wastage.p  pNow Problem is i have to calculate permutationsthrough recursion for input array and then apply logic which calculate sequentially for any permutation...and choose the best with lowest Total wastage from all permutation.My Code is OK for values of 1 to 7. onward like 8,9 or more, calculation time increases with a big difference because of increasing permutation numbers and their objects.I want the code to work for around 50 numbers.p  pCan any one suggest any better solution or changep  pMy codep  pClass for deal with one

Negative 80035 pI came across a file in our project, called  wait for it  celery.py. Yes, and celery.py imports from the installed celery module see a hrefhttpwww.celeryproject.org relnofollowhttpwww.celeryproject.orga which is not an issue because the projects celery.py usesp  precodefrom future import absoluteimport      codepre  pbefore importing from the installed celery module. Now, the problem comes from djcelery djangocelery which also would like to import from celery the installed one, not the project celery.py. This is where the clash comes because  djcelery encounters the projects celery.py before it encounters the installed celery. How can I resolve thisp
Negative 80035 pIm using AVAssetWriterAVAssetWriterInput to write H.264 raw data to an MP4 file. As Im receiving the data from a remote server, I use the following CoreMedia APIs to get a sample buffer CMSampleBufferRef containing the H.264 data in AVCC format that is in turned appended to an MP4 file by sending to an codeAVAssetWriterInputcode the message codeBOOLappendSampleBufferCMSampleBufferRefsampleBuffercodep  blockquote   ol   licodeCMBlockBufferCreateWithMemoryBlockcode to create a memory blockli   licodeCMBlockBufferReplaceDataBytescode to write the H.264 in AVCC format to the memory blockli   licodeCMSampleBufferCreatecode to create a sample buffer with the memory block and a format descriptor containing the H.264 extradatali   ol blockquote  pEverything works as expected, the only problem with this approach is that Im periodically calling the above APIs and what I would really like is instead to be able to reuse the resources allocated  in particular codeCMSampleBufferRefcode and codeCMBlockBufferRefcode. strongBasically, I would like to have a pool of codeCMSampleBuffercodes and be able to update its memory content and format descriptor as Im receiving new H.264 data from the remote serverstrong.p  pI know that exists codeAVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptorcodethat gives access to a codeCVPixelBufferPoolcode but, I cant use it in my case because as far as I know, to properly instantiate a pixel buffer adaptor, at minimum I need to be able to pass the video frame dimensions which I would know until I  parse the stream. Further, I dont know how to write the H.264 extradata with a codeCVPixelBuffercode. So, Im thinking that I need to stick with codeCMSampleBuffercode. Unfortunately, it seems that CoreMedia APIs dont offer the possibility to update the memory block nor the format descriptor of a sample buffer once created as far as I can tell, I only have access to immutable references of those objects. Thus, the best I can do so far is to reuse the memory block codeCMBlockBufferRefcode but Im still recreating the sample buffer. My code is below. Hopefully someone here will have some ideas on how to implement a pool of codeCMSampleBuffercodes or perhaps a more efficient way to write H.264 AVCC stream to MP4p  precode CMSampleBufferRefsampleBufferWithDataNSDatadata formatDescriptorCMFormatDescriptionRefformatDescription      OSStatus result      CMSampleBufferRef sampleBuffer  NULL       blockBuffer is a CMBlockBufferRef instance variable     if blockBuffer              sizet blockLength  MAXLENGTH         result  CMBlockBufferCreateWithMemoryBlockkCFAllocatorDefault,                                                     NULL,                                                     blockLength,                                                     kCFAllocatorDefault,                                                     NULL,                                                     0,                                                     blockLength,                                                     kCMBlockBufferAssureMemoryNowFlag,                                                     ampblockBuffer           check error           result  CMBlockBufferReplaceDataBytes[data bytes], blockBuffer, 0, [data length]       check error      const sizet sampleSizes  [data length]      CMSampleTimingInfo timing  [self sampleTimingInfo]      result  CMSampleBufferCreatekCFAllocatorDefault,                                   blockBuffer,                                   YES,                                   NULL,                                   NULL,                                   formatDescription,                                   1,                                   1,                                   amptiming,                                   1,                                   ampsampleSizes,                                   ampsampleBuffer       check error      return sampleBuffer  codepre
Negative 80035 pI search for the name and later the algorithm   of the following problem find the shortest path from point z0 to ze such as the path stays on the road. The illustration below shows it better. The road is defined by two vectors of points Xx1,...,xk and Yy1,...,yn. We assume that the problem is not tricky i.e. paths X, Y do not cross, initial  end points are on the road, etc.. We want to find red line defined as a vector Z being a shortest path connecting z0 with zend and passing only by the road. Algorithm does not need to be fast.

Negative 80035 pId like to have links with the syntax code[[foo bar]]code go to files with the name codefoo bar.orgcode. This would make using orgmode much more like using a personal local wiki. p  pIs this possible without breaking existing link functionality Id also ideally still be able to export to html, etc. with standard orgmode tools.p  pThe best Ive been able to do is something like codesetq orglinkabbrevalist o  . files.orgcodep  pThis lets me use the syntax code[[ofoo bar]]code, but that is more verbose, and looks distractingly ugly inline. For example codeThe quick brown ofox jumps over the olazydogcode. And code[[ofoo bar][foo bar]]code is even more verbose to type and edit though it reads fine in org mode.p

Negative 80035 pAdditional info I thought it might be helpful to say that my forms and classes are in the same solution as the already updated forms.p  pIn our company we have this project which 3 people are working on it. One works on the database part, me and another colleague of mine are working on making the UI ready and relating it to database which is MS SQL Server 2012 and we are programming in C in VS 2012. p  pThe problem is that I made this one form ready, but the server version is ahead of me. That is, if I check in the whole program, I will damage the project as some forms has changed and the version I have is older. I tried right clicking and checking in only the forms and classes which I, myself made and I have their latest version. They check in without any error or anything, but the problem is, when my colleagues or myselfafter deleting my source project try to get latest version, my forms or classes doesnt show up. p  pWe also tried to check in the whole program but only accept those pending changes which are made by me, still no success. p  pThe problem is, we are kinda afraid to play with the server version as a lot of effort has gone into it. p  pAny help will be really appreciated as Im stuck with this problem and the manager wont give me more parts of the program to make until we can come up with some way to deal with this.p

Compiled with codeclang stdc1y foo.cppcode, the code,p  precode[[deprecatedAvoid at all cost]] void foo    int mainvoid    foo  codepre  poutputs,p  precodetest.cpp63 warning foo is deprecated [Wdeprecateddeclarations]   foo    test.cpp26 note foo declared here void foo         1 warning generated. codepre  pwithout specifying the reason. Is there a way to get it to do thatp  pThe only way I have found to do that by including the attribute on the same line as the function header. What Im looking for is a specific flag that would give the reason for deprecation with the warning.p  pThe code,p  precode[[deprecatedAvoid at all cost]] void foo    int mainvoid    foo  codepre  pproduces,p  precodetest.cpp53 warning foo is deprecated [Wdeprecateddeclarations]   foo    test.cpp143 note foo declared here [[deprecatedAvoid at all cost]] void foo                                          1 warning generated. codepre  pwhich is sort of what I want.p

codepre  pSo as you can see, I have it set up so that it tells me the average number of collisions that occurred when constructing this particular hash table. There are 30 numbers and 30 spaces for them to occupy. I tried changing the parameter for the amount of available spaces from 30 to 60, but that didnt change anything, and I want to figure out how to fix this.p  pThis is important to me because I want to take this code up a notch. I would like to try this program out for a larger set of numbers, maybe a thousand or more, but I dont want to just manually input a thousand more string numbers. How would I write a loop that would do this for me For example, if I put 1000 in its parameter, it will produce a thousand numbers in string notation as seen in the code that will be used.p  pI also want to make it so that I can have multiple of these string numbers run in a single program execution. For example, the hash table can hold 1000 numbers, so then it will run the program with 1 number, then 2,3, etc... until it has done so all the way up to 1000. And for each time it does this, I want it to output the average number of collisions that occurred in that particular run. With only 1 number there will be no collision, and eventually collisions will occur as the amount of numbers increases.p  pBy doing this, I could then make a graph that shows how the amount of collisions changes as the ratio of numbers to available spots changes. For example, the xaxis would be the average collisions, and the yaxis would be the ratio of the amount of inputed numbers compared with the total available spaces meaning that it would have a value range from 0 to 1.00 p  pThank you in advance to all that take the time to teach me. I really appreciate it.p

Negative 80035 pI want to write a small assembly routine which uses a temporary register. When I say temporary register I mean its not an input or output register in the sense of constraints for an codeasmcode block. I could just pick any register and then include it in the clobber list, but I thought it would be nicer for the compiler to be able to choose. What is the correct way to handle this The only suggestion Ive found online is to list it as an output register and then not actually use the output.p

Negative 80035 pI have a shared library that tries to provide a standardized interface, basically a list of functions. Some of these functions are already provided by another shared library. So I could just write the additional functions and ask the user to link to both libraries, i.e. have him do thisp  precodeg foo.c lmine lother codepre  pIn order to make things easier for the user, however, I dont want to do that. Given the situation Im in, this would be way more complicated than just adding a flag in some script. I want the user to link only against my library and get the functions from the other library as well.p  pIn Windows, I could use DLL forwarders and simply list the functions I want reexported. In MacOS, I could use the codereexportlibrarycode linker option to make my library pretend to include the other one. If I didnt mind creating a full copy of the other library and had a static version, I could use the codewholearchivecode on that to pull it into my library wholesale.p  pBut is there any way in Linux to give the export table of my library an entry that says this function is in that other library over therep  pOr alternatively, is there anything I can do to my library that makes it so that when it is given to the linker, the linker will say, oh, I need to pull in that other library too The documentation of the coderpathlinkcode options suggests that this should just work, but it doesnt. libtool does this, of course, but libtool isnt an option.p  pWhat I could of course do is just fill my library with tiny stubs for these functions, but Id rather not. That would be quite annoying what with having to do renaming in just the correct order so that the linker picks up the right version at the right time. But if theres really no other way, any help on proceeding with that would be appreciated too.p

Negative 80035 pI have Linux laptop with builtin camera, 2 other cameras, OpenCVbased program.p  pI need to pass the device number of those two cameras to the program automatically.p  pIn OpenCV you open a camera with codevideoCapture.openncode, where codevideoCapturecode is an object of a codecvVideoCapturecode and codencode is device number of the camera you wish to open. My program uses two webcams. Here OpenCV part of this question is over.p  pUsually this codencode is hardcoded or manually passed by user. I want to write a script that would automatically detect the device number of two desired cameras. But builtin camera is the obstacle.p  pWhen loaded, Linux defaults the device number of the builtin camera to code0code. Two connected USBcameras get the numbers code1code and code2code accordingly. And when you reboot the laptop you most probably get all the numbers mixed up, e.g. builtin camera  code1code, code0code and code2code  for USBcameras. And anyways I have to change the device numbers in the code when I switch the platfrom and execute the program on desktop which have no builtin cameras.p  pI thought I could write sh script that would parse an output of codelsusb  grep Logitechcode those two USB webcams are Logitech ones and get the device number according to USB Bus number but that rebooting thing obstructs this.p  pI would appreciate any ideas and thoughts on what I could check out for the problem. p

Negative 80035 pI have an Oracle DB sequence that is being called by the following JPA.  The problem is that the sequence that is being returned is not the same sequence number that the database is actually using.  The JPA component is usually one less than the actual id  for the record that is inserted into the table.  For instance, when debugging JPA states that the objects Id will be 3689711 but after the record is persisted, the actual record in the table is 3689712, but it isnt always so recognizable.  Once the record is created, I need to obtain the correct ID so that I can pass it to another process, but without the correct number, the next process fails.p  precodeId SequenceGeneratornameSDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT, allocationSize1 GeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.SEQUENCE,generatorSDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT Basicoptional  false NotNull Columnname  ID private Long id codepre  p1 I have the following DDL for my Oracle sequencep  precodeCREATE SEQUENCE  SDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT   MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 999999999999999999999999999  INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 3690531 CACHE 20 NOORDER  NOCYCLE  codepre  pI know I could work around this and add a temporary value to another field and then do a look up on a temporary value to get the real value of the PK after the record is persisted, but this seems like a lot of extra DB calls for something this basic.  Any help would be appreciated.p  p2 It appears that JPA simply queries the nextVal from the sequence but has no way of locking that in to the DB prior to the actual commit.  Since it executes the sequence to determine the next value that forces the sequence to automatically generate a new nextVal.  Im not sure that it matters, but my sequence is triggered before the record inserts into the table.  So, when JPA finally commits the record, the underlying database triggersequence actually generates a new sequence value meaning the original sequence number JPA claimed to have is actually overwritten by the underlying database when it calls the sequence again.  So, the only solution that seems to make sense is to modify the underlying database trigger to not generate a sequence if the column already has a value, but that seems risky.  The sequence generation within JPA seems flawed at best if you need to take advantage of the sequence number for other processes.p

Negative 80035 pI am using Bootstrap to build a nonresponsive website.

I do not want the navigation bar to have any change no matter how the browser width changes. I want it to be static. How can I do this I understand this is going to be CSS tricks, but dont know how to start.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI am abandoning the plan to adapt Bootstraps navbars for a nonresponsive website. Here is from Bootstrap itself a hrefhttpgetbootstrap.comexamplesnonresponsive relnofollowhttpgetbootstrap.comexamplesnonresponsiveap  pemAs a heads up, the navbar component is rather tricky here in that the styles for displaying it are rather specific and detailed. Overrides to ensure desktop styles display are not as performant or sleek as one would like. Just be aware there may be potential gotchas as you build on top of this example when using the navbar.emp  pThere are a lot of simple CSS menus out there.p  pHope this helps others.p
Negative 80035 pI have two classes, one class is called Client and the other one is call Department. The class Department stores an array of Clients. p  pI was making some tests to prove Deep Copy in Java, but it does not seem to work.p  pIn the Department class I have a get method that returns the list of Clients that stores. For examplep  precodepublic Client[] getClientList          return clientList       codepre  pa method that returns the number of clients that I storep  precodepublic int getNumberClients          return n      codepre  pand one method that returns an specific Client from the clientListp  precodepublic Client getClientint pos         return clientList[pos]      codepre  pIn my main program I have created a certain number of Clients and store them into the Department class, specifically in the clientList attribute something like thisp  precodeClient objCli1new Cliente... ... Department objDepnew Department100 objDep.addClientobjCli1 ... codepre  pso now I want to return the array of Clients from the Department class into my main program, and copy their elements into another client Array. Something like thisp  precodeClient[] clientList int nobjDep.getNumberClients clientListnew Client[n] for int i0iltni     clientList[i]objDep.getClienti  codepre  pSo when I print the elements of clientList they are the same as the ones that I have in my Department class. The problem is that if I do something like thisp  precodeclientList[2].setNameMichaels codepre  pit changes the name of the second client that I got stored in my Department class I wonder why is that because I have made a deep copy of the elements that I have in my Department class to the new clientList in my main program. So why is not working Any hint how to do that it would be great.p  pThanksp

Negative 80035 pIs there any open source implementation of a refillable queue in Javap  pEssentially, such a queue would be implemented as a class which reads data from a source and stores it in its memory buffer, which is replenished every time the queue capacity falls below a predefined threshold.

In textview I see text1, I scroll it to the end, then I press on button and it shows text2, but because i finished watching text1 from 30th line, I will see text2 that starts from 30th line and so I see empty space and I need to manually scroll it up.

In the world of C, everything is all fine and dandy the languages integer promotion rules come to the rescue.p  pBut in Go, I have to pass all my arguments to functions as codeuintptrcode which is equivalent to Cs codeuintptrtcode. The return value from the function is also returned this way, and then I will need to compare. Go doesnt allow integer promotion, and it doesnt allow you to convert a signed constant expression into an unsigned one at compiletime.p  pRight now, I have a a hrefhttpsgithub.comandlabsuiblobc5df1b1afc6980d71de17715868ee2c54aa5cf32commonwindows.goL64 relnofollowbit of a jerryriga set up for handling these constants in my a hrefhttpsgithub.comandlabsui relnofollowUI librarya. a hrefhttpsgithub.comandlabsuiblob33d417886563dad94b936a791d3512dc1818fe48sysdatawindows.goL162 relnofollowHeres an example of what this solution looks like in action.a However, Im not quite satisfied with this solution it feels to me like its assuming things about the ABI, and I want to be absolutely sure of what Im doing.p  pSo my question is how are signed values handled when passing them to Windows API functions and how are they handled when returningp  pAll my constants are a hrefhttpsgithub.comandlabsuiblob4a66f1467bf0ee9a69c0758a53ab6f1425da166dtoolswindowsconstgen.go relnofollowautogenerateda a hrefhttpsgithub.comandlabsuiblob74c851754c52adf74e611bc1533c8eb481439d84zconstantswindows386.go relnofollowexample outputa.

Negative 80035 pUsing a SlimDX.Windows.RenderForm, I want to dynamically create a texture of a map of the US, copy that texture to 2 other textures, then draw unique radar data onto each texture. Then I will pass those 2 textures to each be drawn over its own Windows.Forms.Panel. This way, the user will be able to, for example, view base reflectivity and base velocity side by side in the 2 panels. Right now, Ive successfully generated my map of the US onto a texture. But when I try to render it to the panels, I get black and btw, my clear color is a soft grey, not black.p  pEDIT After some playing around, I have modified my code to take that Texture that the TextureRenderer is using, turn it to a stream, and create a new Texture under the device of the RuntimeRenderer. Now I have a soft grey square with a yellow square inside it which is compatible with the 0.9, 0.9... 0.9, 0.9 I use for vertices.

Negative 80035 pI want to write a simple Java Servertype application to stream videos to different clients. My first step would be an again simple Android App containing a VideoView and a MediaPlayer set to Video Streaming a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsmediamediaplayer.html relnofollowMore Information on Android SDK  MediaPlayera though later i might add desktop java application too. p  pWhat im not sure is how i would actually do the streaming on the server. I already wrote a little Http Server processing HTTP GET requests from a client over TCP. There i writestream the files back using this codingp  precodeFileInputStream fs  new FileInputStreamf final byte[] buffer  new byte[1024] int count  0  add the header information to the respone  while count  fs.readbuffer gt 0    os.writebuffer, 0, count   os.flush fs.close os.close codepre  pos being the OutputStream of the Response i get through the tcp socket and f being the requested file. This seems to send the file almost completly at once though and not like i want to, stream it in chunks.p  pSo my questions are p  ul liWhat do i, or do i have to change my coding to actually stream the video, or is it already correct this wayli liWhen i want to make it using UDP instead of TCP would i then only put the buffer byte arrays read from the fileinputstream directly into the DatagramPacket and the MediaPlayer would know what to do with itli ul  pPS I know there are several questions on here about streaming in Java but none of them actually cover the server side but mainly the in this case Android client side.p

Negative 80035 pI have written a small iBeacon demo app that ranges for beacons and then will monitor for beacons in range after they have been found for the first time. After I run this app if its still in the background, I find that the device has trouble making new Bluetooth connections. When I enter my car, for instance, my car infinitely tries to connect to the phone with no success until I turn Bluetooth off and on again. This seems like an issue of keeping Bluetooth active after leaving the area of the iBeacons, but I have stopped ranging for beacons on didExitRegion. I have even attempted stopping ranging for beacons when the view disappears or when the app is closed. Is there some other step to take in order to properly close connections when leaving a rangep  pEdit I only say ranging in the OP, but I have since also made sure to stop monitoring for beacon regions when the app goes inactive and when exiting regions. The problem persistsp  pEdit 2 If I must say specific behavior expected, I expect to be able to range and monitor for beacons while the app is running and while it is in the background without stopping up other Bluetooth connections.

Negative 80035 pLet me start by admitting that I am learning or struggling to learn Android, while also doing something that appears to be somewhat challenging.p  pWhile I think I have understood the basic usage of BroadcastReceivers and I can use one to receive SMSs and do some processing, I would like for this processing to happen even when device goes to sleep. Reading around, and asking a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25730227wakelockrequiredforbroadcastreceiverwhilephonesleepsthis onea, I understand that I need to acquire a PARTIAL wake lock to keep the CPU active, while screenkeyboard are asleep, to emprocess the incoming SMS requestsem, much in the way the main Messaging application or say Hangout or other general messaging apps that can receive the incoming SMS and flash the notification LED and vibrate if configured to do so.p  pHowever, what I am confused about is the followingp  ul liWake lock has to be acquired when work is to be done, and released when there is no work to be done. If wake lock is acquired and never released, you drain battery much faster.li liIf the above is true, then how is a SMS reading application is expected to be immediately notified perhaps using a BroadcastReceiver of the incoming message, while not having to acquire the wakelock permanently li liOne way that comes to my mind is, to use a Service that mostly sleeps, and only periodically wakes up, to check if there are any SMSs. However, this is contrary to the logic that the incoming SMS and its corresponding Broadcast Intent could happen emany timeem, clearly with ample opportunity for the application to emmissem the broadcast.li ul  pSo, how can one develop an application thatp  ul liNever misses, any incoming SMS, and hopefully is notified as soon as it arrives even when device is otherwise sleepingli liConsumes minimum battery, especially since the processing of the SMS Broadcast Intent is very small and simple... computationally minimal.li ul  pstrongemEdit 12Sept2014emstrongp  pWhile Ive accepted the answer, I wanted to add what I understood, although I am still not 100 sure that my understanding is correct.p  pWhat I understood is that, at a low level operating system, firmware and device HW, in an Android device, when the device goes to sleep, there are multiple events that can cause it to wake up. Network events, keyboard events, some if not all sensor events, timer events etc. will cause the device to wake up, and emquicklyem process the event, and try its best to go back to sleep ASAP. As I understand, the last bit is the key. This means, that events like incomingcall, incoming SMS, keypress or other causes that result in a Broadcast Intent, always lead to an Intent to be generated and delivered to all registered BroadcastReceivers. This part is ensured. However, what is not ensured is that all BroadcastReceivers would get enough time, to spend as much time as they need to process the Intent. Instead, they need to acquire a Wake lock of the appropriate kind and ensure that the device doesnt go back to sleep until the Wake lock is released. Now, as I realize, there are multiple ways of acquiring the Wake lock. It could be done directly in the BroadcastReceiver, but apparently not always intuitive as to what is the best and most efficient way to manage it, s.t. it is held for the least amount of time and released as soon as it is not required. For this the SDK provides the WakefulBroadcastReceiver mechanism, making the task of writing software that handled BroadcastIntent simpler when holding a wakelock is necessary. Then there is the alternative called WakefulIntentService, developed by CommonsWare unless I am not mistaken, it is not from the SDK, but 3rd party. p  pI hope I am right p  pstrongemEdit 13Sept2014emstrongp  pMore information available in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25229685broadcastreceiverwakelockneededifonlyasynctaskisexecutedrq1this SO QampAap

Any suggestions more than welcome.p  pThanksdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeWhen putting the data in url manually, the return is correct. Then in data I have page, as     .ajax                                      type GET,                     url agenttalktimepag.load.phptxtDate20070304zoneHongkong,                     data pagepage,                     success functionmsg  If I use  var datastring   idForm.serialize  the return doesnt work. The variables get passed in the url, but the issue seems that the pagepage isnt passed. Which makes the load script not work. I tried to add a hidden field in the form like ltinput typehidden namepage valuepagegt But, seems its not passed as expected by the load script. The page becomes just a string, think in the .ajax it functions as a counter  Any ideas    document.readyfunction     driver.clickfunction   var datastring   testform.serialize                       function loadingshow                     loading.htmlltimg src..imagesloading.gifgt.fadeInfast                                  function loadinghide                     loading.fadeOutfast                                                     function loadDatapage                     loadingshow                        .ajax                                              type GET,                         url agenttalktimepag.load.phptxtDate20070304zoneHongkong,                         data pagepage,                         success functionmsg                                                      container.ajaxCompletefunctionevent, request, settings                                                              loadinghide                                 container.htmlmsg                                                                                             codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodedocument.readyfunction     driver.clickfunction     var txtDatetxtDate.val     var zonezone.val     var dataString  txtDate txtDate  zonezone                           function loadingshow                     loading.htmlltimg src..imagesloading.gifgt.fadeInfast                                  function loadinghide                     loading.fadeOutfast                                                     function loadDatapage                     loadingshow                        .ajax           type GET,                         url agenttalktimepag.load.php,                         data dataString,                         success functionmsg                                                      container.ajaxCompletefunctionevent, request, settings                                                              loadinghide                                 container.htmlmsg                                                                                                                loadData1   For first time page load default results                 container .pagination li.active.liveclick,function                     var page  this.attrp                     loadDatapage                                                                  gobtn.liveclick,function                     var page  parseInt.goto.val                     var noofpages  parseInt.total.attra                     ifpage  0  page lt noofpages                         loadDatapage                     else                         alertEnter a PAGE between 1 and noofpages                         .goto.val.focus                         return false                                                                        codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalENgt     lt This is a pagination script using Jquery, Ajax and PHP      The enhancements done in this script pagination with first,last, previous, next buttons gt      lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetISO88591gt         lttitlegtPagination with Jquery, Ajax, PHPlttitlegt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcjqueryexternaljqueryjquery.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcjqueryjqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltlink relstylesheet hrefincludesjqueryjqueryui.cssgt         ltlink typetextcss relstylesheet hrefstyle.cssgt         ltscript typetextjavascript  srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.4.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt                  ltheadgt     ltbodygt      ltdiv aligncenter stylefontsize24pxcolorcc0000fontweightboldgtPagination with jquery, Ajax and PHPltdivgt      ltform idtestformgt     ltinput typetext nametxtDate idtxtDategt     ltselect idzone namezonegt         ltoption valueHongkonggtHongkongltoptiongt         ltoption valueESTgtESTltoptiongt     ltselectgt     ltinput typebutton iddriver namesubmit valueSearchgt     ltformgt          ltdiv idloadinggtltdivgt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltdiv classdatagtltdivgt             ltdiv classpaginationgtltdivgt         ltdivgt      ltbodygt     lthtmlgtcodepre div div  p
Negative 80035 pI started to learn Java programming a while back, but never got very far, now I am starting back up again but have stumbled upon a problem. p  pcodedouble c 0.000001 System.out.printf4.3f,ccodep  pWhen I type the above code into Eclipse it gives me an error message under printf saying change type c to object. What am I doing wrong And sorry if this a dumb question however I have looked around the internet and have not found any answers.p
Negative 80035 pI am fairly new to ASP.Net and C, so please bare with me.p  pSo I have created a form that includes a registration and login form in Visual Studio using the default Web Form that is already provided. So the code for someone to register and login is already provided and their inputted details are already sent to a default membership database.p  pWhat I want is once a user is logged in, they can access a membersonly webpage where they enter additional details and those details can be inserted into a database I created myself. However, what I also want, is once the person enters their details into my database, they can later go back and change it.p  pWhat I would like to know is how can I get that specific user to access strongonly their recordsstrong p  pI understand the use of FormView and DetailView, but they seem to display the entire database table, while I only want that specific view. I thought of trying to display the recently added records, but this causes problems because when someone else logs back into the website again and view their details, it will probably end up showing another record instead.p

You do not actually emmoveem between pages in a ReactJS app, its just the URL that changes.p  pThe cause of this issue is that the server needs to call the AJAX API, during serverside rendering, but the server has no knowledge of the page origin as seen by browsers codehttpwww.example.com3000code.p  pIs there a way of telling this to the serverside rendererp  pI have already thought of a nasty workaround, where you use full URLs for both client and server, but this must be configured explicitly for each development, test and production server that runs the code. p

Negative 80035 pWe have a couple of web services RESTSOAP running in Apache Camel 2.13.0 based on CXF version 2.7.10 which use SSL and basic authentication all the way, which worked pretty fine.p  pDue to a version upgrade of Camel to version 2.14.0, which internally uses now CXF 3.0.1, our services now stoped working as of a codeProtocol mismatch for port x engines protocol is http, the url protocol is httpscode  the configuration however was untouched during the versionupdate.p  precode...

Note that CXF will use the jetty configuration beans during its initialization process and therefore create a SSL secured connection for HTTPS invoked URLs  at least it did before the versionupgrade.p  pThe route now can access the service using this very simple routep  precodepublic class Endpoint1Route extends RouteBuilder      Override     public void configure throws Exception              fromcxfbeanendpoint1Service             .tologendpoint1Service          fromcxfbeanendpoint1ServiceSSL             .tologendpoint1ServiceSSL       codepre  pThis worked well with CXF 2.7.10 and Camel 2.13.0  but as already stated above, after the upgrade there is a protocol mismatch for some reason as hopefully can be seen from the githubproject Ive linked after cloning the project, you need to execute generatesources and then start codeServicesAppcode as Java standalone application.p  pIve also created a new branch for the versionupgrade to simplify the switch between both versions.p  pAnyone has any idea why the configuration of Jetty, which worked before the version upgrade, now returns this protocol mismatch error Am I missing any updated libraries I havent figured out yet Or am I configuring something wrong in first placep  hr  pEditp  pAfter further testing I am now sure that some API changes inside CXF led to the problems as the bean which configures the SSL secured Jetty server is no longer executed on startup, while with version 2.7.10 the bean gets executed.p  pThis changes the actual question to How to configure a SSL secured Jetty Server in Apache CXF 3.0.1p  hr  pEdit 2p  pI managed to get a SSL secured Jetty server running in Camel 2.14.0CXF 3.0.1 but only via a hrefhttpsgithub.comRovoMeCamelCxfJettytreeJettywithXMLconfiguration relnofollowXML configurationa. As we prefer Java config over XML, we are still looking for a method to configure Jetty with SSL in CXF 3.0.1  The skip of the jettySSLEngineFactory Spring bean, though, seems like a further CXF bug to me.p  pTo clarify, in CXF 2.7.x a jetty server could get configured in Java on creating a Spring bean which returns a codeJettyHTTPServerEngineFactorycode instance, as showcased in the masterbranch of the github project linked above. This bean was used by CXF while configuring the server instance and therefore set up the SSL secured Jetty server. However, in CXF 3.0.1 this bean no longer is invoked  only codeJettyDestinationFactorycode which I have no clue on how to set up a SSL secured server with. Also the XML example prestended a hrefhttpcxf.apache.orgdocsjettyconfiguration.html relnofollowin the docsa gives no clue on how to set up Jetty with SSL using a destination factory.p  pAs the codeenginefactorycode inside the XML example in the docs actually maps to a codeJettyHTTPServerEngineFactorycode and Jetty configuration over XML is working fine, this seems to pinpoint a Spring bean injection bug inside CXF 3.0.1 to me.p

Negative 80035 pI have been developing one Windows Store app for Win 8.1. Is there a way to access the users OneDrive which is already synced on the hard drive I need to access it as a StorageFolder. Similarly to KnownFolders and all the libraries. The reason behind that is that I am doing something like a gallery app that displays thumbnails of videos and pictures. When the users decides the app shows the media in full size and if it is a video, it is played. The app counts on the fact that OneDrive automatically syncs all the data, so it does need to be retrieved via the Live SDK API. If I use REST, it will be just too slow. Do you know if there is a way to achieve the mentioned approach effectively or maybe some alternativep  pI have been researching extensively, but with no avail. p  pThank youp  pAll the best, Roskop
Negative 80035 pI have a directive that is restricted to attribute. I want to do either of 2 things. If a certain condition is met, I want to use the children for the element with the directive attribute as the model thats the content or if that condition is not met then I want to data bind from a service instead, so the directive would replace the children with something i was given. I have a directive that is doing the latter but Im finding it very hard to have it grab the children before the compiler comes in and replaces it with its template... Anyone know how this is done if its possiblep
Negative 80035 pI have a C Winforms application that Im adapting for Windows 8.1. Part of this is working out how the virtual keyboard works with my app.  It currently works fine in Windows 7 but Windows 8.1 is the bane of my existence.  I have read a lot of postings but nothing helps for what I am trying to achieve.p  pTo simplify my solution, all I am looking to do is send a call to the virtual keyboard to tell it to dock to the bottom of the screen or the top of the screen depending on some algorithms in my application.  I havent seen any settings in Windows 8 preferences to even set the keyboard to dock to the top so maybe that isnt possible.p  pAlternatively, if there is a way to set the x,y coordinates of the keyboard that would help me as I could do some calculations to do my own docking type action.p  pAny guidance people can give is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 80035 pBootstrap selectpicker hides original select and creates additional element filling it with options from the select. However when using ngOptions selectpicker doesnt automatically updates itself.p  pSo Ive created a directive which listens for ngOptions collection changes and calls codeelement.selectpickercodep  pIt works fine if no filtering is applied for ngOptions. Otherwise filering function returns new array each time it is called what causes watch callback to fire which recreates selectpicker. Angular detects DOM has changed and starts new digest cycle effectively infinitely looping the process. After 10 iterations Angular as expected throws exception.p  pI need to temporarily unsubscribe from the watch when creating selectpicker und later subscribe again when digest cycles are finished. Is it possiblep  pstrongUpdate1strongp  pThougt a little more and now have an Idea to try. Filter defines a factory returning filtering function thus I can use captured array to store filtered content  the reference wont change so listener will fire only when contents of collection changes.p
Negative 80035 pIm working on a major update to one of my applications and trying to cut down memory usage and making it cleaner and faster. I was using Instruments to profile the app and I was looking at the UIImage allocations, I have about 10 when the app starts out although one is a status bar icon Dont know why thats included. When i open up my Settings view controller which is in a split view controller on iPad it has basically an image with every table view cell, which is a lot. Presenting it for the first time adds 42 images. when I dismiss this view controller, there is still 52 images, when there should be only 10 now. If I present the controller again, there are now 91 images. This keeps going up and up. Instruments doesnt say there is a leak and I cant figure out what is happening. Each cell sets an image like p  precodecell.imageView.image  [UIImage imageNamedHelpIcon] codepre  pHow can I figure out why these images are not being released p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHXYel.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT I think Its deallocating the images now. I changed from setting the imageView image directly to codesetImagecode, so a table cell looks like this nowp  precode    cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]     if cell           cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleValue1 reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]          cell.textLabel.text  NSLocalizedStringHomepage, Homepage                 UIImage cellImage  [UIImage imageNamedHomepageIcon]                 [cell.imageView setImagecellImage] [MLThemeManager customizeTableViewCellcell] return cell codepre  pcodeMLThemeManagercode is a singleton that using a theme class to set properties of the cell to a theme, like the text label color, highlighted color, detail text label color, and background color. p
Negative 80035 pIm making a form where the user can RSVP for themselves and up to 5 others. Each guest has a text field for their names and then radio buttons yes or no as to whether they are attending or not. By default Guest 1 amp 2 are displayed and then there is a button the user can click to add another guest up until guest 6.p  pGuests 3  6 are contained in their own objects like thisp  precodevar guestThree     name  document.querySelectorlabel[fornameOfThirdGuest],   attendingYes  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestThreeAttendingYes],   attendingNo  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestThreeAttendingNo]  var guestFour     name  document.querySelectorlabel[fornameOfFourthGuest],   attendingYes  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestFourAttendingYes],   attendingNo  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestFourAttendingNo]  var guestFive     name  document.querySelectorlabel[fornameOfFifthGuest],   attendingYes  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestFiveAttendingYes],   attendingNo  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestFiveAttendingNo]  var guestSix     name  document.querySelectorlabel[fornameOfSixthGuest],   attendingYes  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestSixAttendingYes],   attendingNo  document.querySelectorlabel[forguestSixAttendingNo]  codepre  pI am hiding guests 3  6 using the following function which are then converted to methods for the above objectsp  precodefunction hideFields    this.name.style.display  none   this.attendingYes.style.display  none   this.attendingNo.style.display  none  codepre  pI also have the opposite of the above function in showFieldsp  precodefunction showFields    this.name.style.display  block   this.attendingYes.style.display  block   this.attendingNo.style.display  block  codepre  pSo the idea here is that when the add guest button which is assigned to the variable addGuest is clicked guest 3 will be added. Then when its clicked again guest 4 will be added and so on until 6. Ive added the guestThree  guestSix objects to the following arrayp  precodevar extraGuests  [guestThree, guestFour, guestFive, guestSix] codepre  pand then using the following for loopp  precodefor var guest  0 guest lt extraGuests.length guest    addGuest.onclick  function        extraGuests[guest].showFields     codepre  pBut this doesnt work. I have discovered through testing that guest loops all the way round to 4 without executing the showFields methods. If I was to add a break after the onclick event then guestThree will display but thats it obviously because thats how break works but this atleast shows that the loop works as I hoped  to an extent. p  pSo what I am asking of you guys is  what am I doing wrong How do I make it so that the guest variable doesnt loop straight to 4 I need each iteration to be 0, 1, 2 and finally 3 and as far as I can see that is exactly what emshouldem be happeningp  pCheersp

Negative 80035 pIm experimenting with three.js. Based on several tutorials Ive created a small script that loads an object from obj file, puts a texture on it and provides some interactive features like camera control and collision detection when the cursor moves over the object on screen.p  pI know how i can change the transparency of the whole object, but now Im looking for a way to make the loaded object partially transparent depending on the cursors position. If the ray of the cursor intersects the object, all triangles nearby the collision point should get a higher transparency so that i can see other objects inside or behind this object. Is there a way to do this Anybody knows a tutorial which shows a solution for the implementation  with three.js p  pFor any help or approach I would be grateful.p

Negative 80035 pI imported the Document class from MSWORD.OLB but there is no SaveAs member function, instead there is SaveAs2. SaveAs2 simply has 1 more parameter in the end to allow backward compatibility. However, if I deploy my C application to other computer with older version of MS Office installed, say Office 2007, which has no SaveAs2 method in Document interface. That will give me an error. Is there any way to call SaveAs method using Word 2013 Apparently, you can do so in Word VBA code but I dont know how to do it in C.p

But I cannot figure out it a way I can make myself understand, plus it further confused me that then how python manipulates its lists. p  pI am sure there is something in the design of Python language that I dont know about leading to all these confusions. Help me sort them out and if possible, use somewhat picture visualizations. It would be very easy then for me to understand whats going on p

Negative 80035 pI am working on a minecraft clone using JME and I have come across a problem that I cant have too many blocks on the screen without destroying the fps. As of right now when I try to load 1000 blocks the fps drops to around 49. I have optimized it so that if two blocks touch each other their faces that are touching arent drawn. p  pSo after doing some research I discovered I can optimize the rootNode using GeomteryBatchFactory.optimize which helped a lot. However, the problem is that now I cannot remove any of the blocks because they are still rendered. Is there any waymethod to remove the blocks from the optimizationp  pI also found another method of optimizing using a vertex buffer. After doing more research I realize that this could help, however I couldnt find any examples demonstrating how to use it correctly. So if you think that using a vertex buffer is the better way of going around this problem could you possibly lead me to some tutorials Thank you. p  pAlso, I know this question isnt exactly code based but I dont really know where else to go right now because the JME forums are down. Sorry. p

Let me explain the scenario which is causing me issuesp  pI have hit an issue where using a Chinese Simplified, China Microsoft Pinyin causes a CLR exception. The scenario is when a TextBox is handling its TextChanged event. For example p  ul liA TextBox should not accept characters but only numbers. In order to achieve that it is handling its TextChanged event and in that event it handles the input by reversing its Text property to the last correct input character by character. In this scenario if an Chinese Simplified, China Microsoft Pinyin IME is used an a a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms228990vvs.110.aspx relnofollowFatalExecutionEngineErrora is thrown.li ul  pIn WPF it is possible to overcome this issue by not reversing the Text in the TextChanged event by using the InputMethod.Current.a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.inputmethod.imestatevvs.110.aspx relnofollowImeStatea to check if an IME is active. Unfortunately this is not available in the Silverlight framework which is why I am posting this question.p  pCurrently the only thing I have found is that I could set IsInputMethodEnabled property of the InputMethod class to the TextBox control in order disable all IME input but this of course will not only disable the incorrect input but also the correct one.p  pAnyone has any ideas how I could detect if a IME is usedactive in the Silverlight platform Thanks.p

Negative 80035 pso, Im currently working on a DSL implementation by using ANTLR with Java. By so far, Ive created my own AST hierarchy based on the ANTLR grammar. Why Because unfortunately, ANTLR v4 doesnt support outputAST.p  pAnyway, the hierarchy can be simplified as the followingp  precodeExpressions gt BinaryExpressionsExpressions, Expressions     gt MultiplicationExpression, Expression     gt AdditionExpression, Expression     gt GreaterEqualExpression, Expression     gt LessEqualExpression, Expression codepre  pand the list goes on. Anyway, given this, I produce a quite well organised hierarchy so far. So for example 3  2  3 would produce something likep  precodeAdditionInteger3, MultiplicationInteger2, Integer3 codepre  pwhere the class of the object is addition.p  pAnyway, given this, how can I traverse over this hierarchy The example above is just a quick overview of the overall complexity, but how can I by using recursive functions iterate over this Because for instance, defining for ASTNode node  someNode doesnt work because the object of ASTNode top level class  the mother of all classes cannot be iterated.p  pThanks p

Negative 80035 pI made this type class to make codeDivisiblecode functors the contravariant analogue to codeApplicativecode  a hrefhttpshackage.haskell.orgpackagecontravariant1.2docsDataFunctorContravariantDivisible.html relnofollowhttpshackage.haskell.orgpackagecontravariant1.2docsDataFunctorContravariantDivisible.htmla usable with functions of multiple arguments in much the same way as codeApplicativecode functors are.p  pThe idea is that you write codeunFunc  fa  fb  fccode, wherep  precodeunFunc  z gt a, b, c,  fa  f a fb  f b fc  f c codepre  pto get an codef zcode, for some codeDivisiblecode functor codefcode. codecode is codedividecode from codeData.Functor.Contravariant.Divisiblecode, and codecode is codedApplycode from my code belowp  precode LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts            , FlexibleInstances            , FunctionalDependencies            , MultiParamTypeClasses            , TypeFamilies            , UndecidableInstances     import Control.Applicative ltgt, ltgt, Applicative import Data.Functor.Contravariant.Divisible    Divisibledivide, conquer   , divided     result  b gt c gt a gt b gt a gt c result  fmap  class Divisible f gt DivisibleApply f t z r  f t z gt r, r t gt f, r t gt z   where dApply  f a, t gt f z gt f a gt r  instance Divisible f gt DivisibleApply f  z f z   where dApply  . flip divided conquer  instance DivisibleApply f b z r gt DivisibleApply f a, b z f a, b gt f z   where dApply  flip result.result divided codepre  pThis actually works But the class codeDivisibleApplycode seems way too complicated. Im only actually switching on the codetcode parameter, and I actually want to be completely polymorphic in codefcode and codezcode theyre only class parameters because the instances need to instantiate codercode in terms of them.p  pOriginally I tried this with type families the class had only a single parameter codetcode, and the role of codercode was taken by an associated type. The problem I had with that and many other variations was that even when I could get it to accept the class and instances, applying it to more than one argument failed with ambiguous type variables. I believe this was because I wasnt communicating to haskell that I was using the same codefcode all the way through.p  pIs it possible to get back to simpler types for codedApplycode while still keeping the codeunFunc  fa  fb  fccode usagep  pMy ultimate goal is to use this to make a type class that encompasses embothem codeApplicativecode and codeDivisiblecode given a pair of functions codefunc  a gt b gt c gt zcode and codeunFunc  z gt a, b, c, code it should be possible to make a function codef a gt f b gt f cgt f zcode knowing only that codefcode is either covariant or contravariant, without knowing which. Hence why I want to mirror the structure of codeApplicativecode usagep
Negative 80035 pIm trying to figure out the best way to get a list of directories using a wildcard that doesnt include 8.3 format names.  Im trying to get all the directories using a wildcard pattern like strong3626strong.

For example with the above wild card I get both strong3626 Burnt Chimneystrong and strong3689 Lavistastrong.  You can see the same behavior using a command prompt and the command strongdir 3626strong.  This is on Windows 7 32 bit.  How can I get only long file names to returnp

Negative 80035 pIve tried to find a solution at stackoverflow but cant seem to find one quite like mine so here it goes. I have a computer in the lab that is connected to various devices like pantilt units, cameras, and light sensors and has all their drivers installed. I have C code on the lab computer that knows how to talk to the hardware. The C code can set an exposure time, ask for a picture, get one back, and display it in a picture box. I can tell the pantilt to move to a location and have it respond when done. If I am in the lab, it all works just the way I want.p  pThe problem is that I want it to feel like I am at the lab computer when I am really at another computer. Most likely, I will be running the code that is on the non lab computer from inside Visual Studio. The program running in the lab will not be running from Visual Studio. With Remoting, this is a piece of cake. Put the code that talks to the hardware into a class, use MarshalByRefObject along with an interface I create, add RegisterWellKnownServiceType and presto I can use GetObject to get a reference and control it like I was sitting at the computer in the lab. So I know that remoting will work.p  pHowever, remoting is being phased out for WCF not to mention its not real safe out in the real world. It appears to me that WCF is going to make a local copy by value of the remote object which means it will not be on the lab computer and therefore unable to interact with the hardware that is attached. Someday this lab computer and all the sensor equipment is going to be moved away and I will have to access it remotely using the internet. A couple of years ago I did this exact thing but I was using remoting. Since remoting is so insecure, how do I do this without using remoting Does WCF not have something equivalent to MarshalByRefObject If WCF only uses by value, then it seems like they are phasing something out without providing functionality to replace it. Is there a way to use remoting that is not insecure Is there something else besides WCF I should usep  pThis may be long winded but I see lots of people get dinged for asking questions that arent very clear so I am trying to be clear. If there is already a post that truly provides me the best answer to my question, I must first apologize for not finding it myself but ask that a link be provided so I can get the answer there.p

Do I need to modify my scripts at all Ive looked and I see I can set the character set for a connection, is this mandatoryp  pPart of my hesitation in thinking I do not need to make any adjustments are the setting the database has today.

Negative 80035 pI have a publisher pushing to a queue at a slightly larger rate than the consumers can consume. For small numbers, it is okay, but for a very large number of messages, RabbitMQ starts writing it to the disk. At a certain point of time, the disk becomes full, and flow control is triggered. From then on, the rates are really slow. Is there any way to decrease or share this load between cluster nodes How should I design my application so that flow control is never triggered I am using RabbitMQ 3.2.3 on three nodes with 13G RAM, and 10G of system disk space  connected to each other through the cluster. Two of these are RAM nodes, and the remaining one is a disk node, also used for RabbitMQ management plugin.p

Negative 80035 pThis is my very first question asked ever. So, please be patient while I try to explain my problem.p  pI have a table as follows which is giving me the hierarchy structure for some accountp  precodedeclare AccountDefinitions table           AccountID int identity1, 1                    primary key                    not null,      AccountNumber nvarchar11 not null,      AccountType nvarchar1 not null,      SumSign1 smallint,      SumAccount1 nvarchar11,      SumSign2 smallint,      SumAccount2 nvarchar11,      SumSign3 smallint,      SumAccount3 nvarchar11      codepre  pIf an account is summed up added to another acount then the parent account is in SumAccount1. So, SumAccount1 can be found in AccountNumber again. Thats the ordinary parent  child hierarchy which could be easily solved with a CTE as described in multiple solutions. Yet, there are two more parent columns with the names SumAccount2 and SumAccount3. This means that an account may have up to three parents. But sometimes there are only two parents or no parents. In such cases SumAccount3 and  or the others would be NULL.p  pBasically, now I would need a nested CTE to deal with these multiple possible parents which may lead to multiple different paths. If an account has three parents and each of these have another three parents then there are already nine different paths this account could be potentially added up to.p  pHere is some test data to play around withp  precodeinsert  into AccountDefinitions         AccountNumber, AccountType, SumSign1, SumAccount1, SumSign2,          SumAccount2, SumSign3, SumAccount3 values  NK07005, NU, 0, null,

Negative 80035 pI am new in the domain of sensitivity analysis, I am trying to investigate the  global sensitivity analysis method FAST Fourier Amplitude SEnsitivity testing. I read alot about this subject, starting from the original paper of this method Study of the Sensitivity of coupled reaction systems to uncertainties in rate coefficients, 1973, till many other articles specified for the  application of this method. However till now, I am not convinced how the  fourier coefficients would approximate the partial variance of an input of a model fx1,x2,...,xny. Would some one help me by proposing a referrence where could I find a simple explanation of the concept of such method. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 80035 pIm trying to do some practice to get more comfortable with IA32 assembly, and am struggling a bit on translating this recursive snippet of assembly code to understandable C code.

Negative 80035 pI want to change the value of the char at the index of the caret to [br].  br example of what i mean lets say we have a textbox and a user enters some text, after a while he remembered that he forgot to start a new line, so he moves his caret to the location where he wants a new line and press returnenter. i want to add to that point the string [br], using javascript only. here is what i got nowp  precodelttextarea idtextarea onkeydownjavascriptDoLinegtlttextareagt codepre  pAnd here is the codeDoLinecode functionp  precode    function DoLine      if event.keyCode  13        var text  document.getElementByIdtextarea.value       text  [br]       if text.indexOf[br]  text.length          var getTextAfter  text[text.lastIndexOf[br]]  r              document.getElementByIdtextarea.value  text         codepre  pthis code adds the [br] at the end of the textarea instade of where the caret is.

Negative 80035 h3The Contexth3  pI have a pretty simple usecase. My page has some configurable shortcut keys. I handle keydown events at the document node and, if the keypress is one of the configurable shortcuts, then I execute a series of actions and call codeevent.preventDefaultcode, etc., to prevent standard actions from taking place for example, overriding CtrlCmdS.p  h3The Problemh3  pCKEditor creates an iframe, making documentlevel event handling complicated. I found a very helpful post on SO that explained how to essentially inject custom documentlevel event handlers into the editors iframebr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3245797howtousecustomkeyboardshortcutswithinckeditorwithjqueryHow to use custom keyboard shortcuts within CKeditor with jQueryap  pUnfortunately, CKEditor is not passing along the original event object. After poking around in my dev console, I found a property that seemed to expose the original event object codeevent.data.code, but is actually a copy of the event object. For example, the codetypecode property is inherited, which confuses jQuerys codetriggercode function its calling codehasOwnPropertytypecode for some reason.p  pI can fix the jQuery issue by making a copy of the event object, but that changes the meaning of this which seems to screw up the codepreventDefaultcode function in the parent handler.p  h3The Questionh3  pI need the emoriginalem event object, one that I can call codepreventDefaultcode on and pass to jQuerys codetriggercode function without needing to manipulate anything. The parent document should handle processing keydown events and determine what action to take its not feasible to duplicate all the configurable shortcut code in the CKEditor contentDom handler.p  h3The Exampleh3  pUnfortunately, SO is much more restrictive about iframe manipulation than jsfiddle, so Ive created both.

Negative 80035 pRecently i have came across a requirement to encrypt db password which is used to create connection for stand alone scheduler using codesymmetric key algorithmcode. p  pFirst db password is encrypted using a codejava swing utilitycode in which i use codeaes128code bit encryption and put into the properties file.  Then in the codeconnection managercode class, in which connection is created,password is read from properties file and decrypted with same key.

Negative 80035 pSo I have program to deal with some sort of work in MySQL database. Im connecting through SSH tunneling with putty yes, I know launching programs on server itself would be much better but I dont have a choice here.p  pI have some problems with programs speed. I solved one by adding .Includetablename but I cant think about a way to do it here.p  pSo purpose of this method is to clean database of unwanted, broken records. Simplified code looks like thisp  precodeusing var dbContext  new MyDatabasedataEntities      Listltachievementsgt achiList  new Listltachievementsgt     var achievementsQuery  from data in dbContext.achievements                             orderby data.playerID                             select data     achiList  achievementsQuery.Skipcounter  5000.Take5000.ToList     foreach achievements record in achiList              var playerExists  from data in dbContext.playersdata                            where data.playerID  record.playerID                            select data         ifplayerExists.Any                      dbContext.achievements.Removerecord                   dbContext.SaveChanges     counter  codepre  pSo this is built this way because I want to load achievements table then check if achievements have their player in playerdata. If such player doesnt exist, remove his achievements.p  pIt is all in do while, so I dont overload my memory by loading all data at once.p  pI know the problem is with checking in database in foreach steps but I cant figure out how to do it without it. Other things I tried generated errors either because EF couldnt translate it into SQL or exceptions were thrown when trying to access nonexisting entity. Doing it in foreach bottlenecks whole program probably because of ping to the server.p  pI will need similar thing more often so I would be really gratefull if anyone could help me with making it so there is no need to call to database in foreach. I know I could try to load whole playersdata table and then check for Any, but some tables I need it on are too big for that. p  pOh, and turning off tracking changes doesnt help at this point because it is not what slows the program.p  pI would be gratefull for any help, thanks in advancep  pEDIT Mmmm, is there a way to get achievements which doesnt have playerdata corresponding to them through one query using associations Like adding to achievements query something likep  precodewhere data.playerdata.Exists codepre  pIntellisense shows me that there is nothing like Exists or Any to use at this point. Is there any trick similar to this It would definitely deal with the problem I have with speed there since database call in foreach wouldnt be needed.p

Using sed was more flexible than hardcoding the variables into each output... p  precodeecho  Keep your eye out for hcbc2Highlightedbchc2bc2 information codepre  pThis is in comparison to something like thisp  precodeecho THIS IS THE TEST OUTPUTsed shcbc2sed sbc  rem [Result] rem Displays THIS IS THE TEST OUTPUT in color rem This is broken in Windows 10s Command Prompt. codepre  pIt appears that using sed, sort, or basically anything except the echo or type commands, it strips the output of color and just outputs the ANSI code instead. This never happened in Windows 7 or XP. For examplep  precodeecho hcbc2THIS IS THE TEST OUTPUTbcsort  rem [Result] rem Displays [13646mTHIS IS THE TEST OUTPUT[0m rem This works if you dont pipe it to sort. rem Outputting to a file and then using type also works. codepre  pThe problem is that echo doesnt support pipe so I cant pipe it postmodification to echo as it would be redundant for almost all purposes. I dont want to redirect it to a file for use with Type, though I guess a pipeable type command alternative would do the trick but I searched around and wasnt able to find one.p  pIt should remain flexible so that using sed, etc... I could insert the highlight anywhere in the text line via keywords, field numbers, etc. I could accomplish this still for examplep  precodeKeep your eye out for Highlighted information  rem [Result] rem Displays Keep your eye out for Highlighted information rem Where Highlighted is the only word in color. codepre  pAny help tackling this without piping to a file or hardcoding the ansi variables into set positions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 80035 pHi I am building a chat application using Parse and Firebase, User details are maintained in Parse and the chat is working on Firebase. p  pIn that every time user start to chat with someone it has to go to Parse Recent  class and it has to check for the Arraylist match, if the row contains a match then it has to return a expected value and I will save that in a shared preference, else we create a value in the code itself and save it in preference. p  pstrongWhat my problem is...strong Actually Parse query is working fine and its passing the expected value for the first time immediately, but for the next time emIf u go back and select another user to chatem, its taking the previous value from the shared preference and then its executing the Parse query, because parse thread is executing in background so its taking time. Because of that the second chat is also saving in the previous value. I just wanna get the value from parse query immediately and save it. But I dont know how to do that.p  precodesharedpreferences  getSharedPreferencesMyPREFERENCES, Context.MODEPRIVATE      groupIdQuery  ParseQuery.getQueryRecent     groupIdQuery.whereContainsAllmembers, Arrays.asListuser1ObjectId, user2ObjectId     Log.dobjectArray, Arrays.asListuser1ObjectId, user2ObjectId.toString     groupIdQuery.findInBackgroundnew FindCallbackltParseObjectgt          Override         public void doneListltParseObjectgt list, ParseException e              if e  null ampamp list.size  0                  for ParseObject dealsObject  list                       recentClassObjectId  dealsObject.getObjectId                     groupId  String dealsObject.getgroupId                     Log.dGroupId, groupId                     String members  String dealsObject.getmembers                     Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, ObjectId   recentClassObjectId  n  GroupId   groupId   value present, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                                   editor  sharedpreferences.edit                 editor.putStringgId, groupId                 Log.difGroupId, groupId                 editor.commit                else                  SharedPreferences.Editor editor  sharedpreferences.edit                  Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext,  No Data present, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                  groupId  user1ObjectId  user2ObjectId                 editor.putStringgId, groupId                 editor.commit                  Log.dElseGroupId, groupId                 entryToRecentChat  new ParseObjectRecent                 entryToRecentChat.putgroupId, groupId                 entryToRecentChat.putlastUser, ParseObject.createWithoutDataUser, user1ObjectId                 entryToRecentChat.putuser, ParseObject.createWithoutDataUser, user2ObjectId                 entryToRecentChat.addAllUniquemembers, Arrays.asListuser1ObjectId, user2ObjectId                 entryToRecentChat.saveEventuallynew SaveCallback                      Override                     public void doneParseException e                          if e  null                              Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Value saved, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                          else                              Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Value not saved, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                             Log.dexception, e.getMessage                                                                                Log.delseGroupId, groupId                  editor  sharedpreferences.edit                 editor.putStringgId, groupId                 Log.difGroupId, groupId                 editor.commit                                 valueId  sharedpreferences.getStringgId, default           mFirebaseRef  new FirebaseFIREBASEURL.childvalueId         Log.dFinalGroupId, valueId codepre  pCan anyone, tell me how to solve thisp

For the photo bytes, I used a very rough solution the photo ByteArray[] was a text field of the JSON something like bytes [0, 0, 223, 23...], and I worked with it by storing it as a BLOB on the DBMS and parsing it back textually on the app when I needed to visualize the image. It worked, but it was very awkward...p  pI wonder if there are better solutions, that possibly are more general for the multimedia content audio, video, etc. and possibly more elegant. Maybe some DBMS for example, MongoDB or servers are more suitable for this kind of workp

My refactoring centered on 4 pretty specific areasp  ol liwrapping all of my AngularJS code in IIFEs,li lirearranging my controller code so that I eliminated virtual functions in favor of assigning functions to members by the same name in my controller, li licleaning up any issues by adding use strict to all of my js files in the appropriate places andli lieliminating the use of a global app variable. All went well and introduced fewer issues than I originally expected.li ol  pAfter I completed the above work, I was astonished by the performance boost it apparently gave my app. The app uses Angular Material fairly heavily and the AM components that seemed to be somewhat sluggish were noticeably snappier.
