Positive 59916 pI launched a very simple splash page about a month ago. I designed the website trying to make sure that mobile users will see the website correctly. I used Chrome Dev tools and a few other online tools to make sure the website displays correctly on mobile.p  pThe other day, however, a few of my android friends sent me a screenshot of my website. The background is not filling in as it is supposed to. This only happens on Android and for the life of me I cant figure out why. In all of my tools it appears fine which is making this very difficult to troubleshoot. When I preview as an Android phone such as a Galaxy S4 in the ChromeDev tools the background is shown correctly. Any ideasp  pHere is my index.htmlp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt lttitlegtblah.comlttitlegt ltheadgt   ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssmaster.css mediascreen charsetutf8gt   ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpmaxcdn.bootstrapcdn.comfontawesome4.3.0cssfontawesome.min.cssgt   ltlink relstylesheet srchttpnormalizecss.googlecode.comsvntrunknormalize.css gt   ltlink relicon typeimagepng hreffavicon.gifgt ltheadgt ltbodygt   ltcontainergt     ltheadlinegtBlahltheadlinegt     ltdescriptiongt       ltredgtHiltredgt,       ltgreengtThereltgreengt,       ltyellowgtFriendsltyellowgt.       lticonsgt         ltpgt           lta hrefhttpwww.github.comblah targetnewgtlti classfa fagithubsquaregtltigtltagt           lta hrefhttpwww.twitter.comblah targetnewgtlti classfa fatwittersquaregtltigtltagt           lta hrefhttpswww.linkedin.comprofileviewid308920572 targetnewgtlti classfa falinkedinsquaregtltigtltagt         ltpgt       lticonsgt     ltdescriptiongt   ltcontainergt ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  pHere is my CSSp  precodeimport urlhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyRaleway400,800,900 html    background url.freedom.jpg norepeat center center fixed   webkitbackgroundsize cover   mozbackgroundsize cover   obackgroundsize cover   backgroundsize cover  body    fontfamily Raleway, sansserif   background rgba247, 247, 247, 1  container    position absolute   height 100   width 100   filter progid DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoadersrc.freedom.jpg, sizingMethodscale   msfilter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoadersrc.freedom.jpg, sizingMethodscale  headline    fontsize 400   margintop 10   fontweight bolder   color 0A83FF   position relative   display block   textalign center   letterspacing 7px  description    paddingleft 2   position relative   display block   textalign center   paddingtop 0.5  icons    fontsize 225  a    color 000000  avisited    textdecoration none  ahover    color 0A83FF  redhover    color FF0000  greenhover    color 00BC00  yellowhover    color E5E500  media only screen and maxwidth 574px    headline      fontsize 200     fontweight 600     color 0A83FF     position relative     display block     textalign center     letterspacing 3px     codepre  pIts like the background is scaling in width, but not adjusting for height.

A Perl 5 module released in 2000 by Damian Conway called QuantumSuperpositions[25] provided an initial proof of concept. While at first, such superpositional values seemed like merely a programmatic curiosity, over time their utility and intuitiveness became widely recognized, and junctions now occupy a central place in Perl 6s design.p  pIn their simplest form, junctions are created by combining a set of values with junctive operatorsp  precodemy anyevendigit  02468  any0, 2, 4, 6, 8 my allodddigits  1amp3amp5amp7amp9  all1, 3, 5, 7, 9 codepre  p indicates a value which is equal to either its left or righthand arguments. amp indicates a value which is equal to both its left and righthand arguments. These values can be used in any code that would use a normal value. Operations performed on a junction act on all members of the junction equally, and combine according to the junctive operator. So, applebanana  s would yield applesbananas. In comparisons, junctions return a single true or false result for the comparison. any junctions return true if the comparison is true for any one of the elements of the junction. all junctions return true if the comparison is true for all of the elements of the junction.p  pJunctions can also be used to more richly augment the type system by introducing a style of generic programming that is constrained to junctions of typesp  precodesub gettint  RGBColorCMYKColor color, num opacity  ...  sub storerecord RecordampStorable rec  ...  codepre
Negative 59916 pI have an SSIS package that copies the data in a table from one SQL Server 2005 to another SQL Server 2005.  I do this with a Data Flow task.  In the package config file I expose the destination table name.p  pProblem is when I change the destination table name in the config file via notepad I get the following error vsneedsnewmetadata.  I think I understand the problem... the destination table column mapping is fixed when I first set up the package.p  pQuestion  whats the easiest way to do the above with an ssis package  p  pIve read online about setting up the metadata programmatically and all but Id like to avoid this.  Also I wrote a C console app that does everything just fine... all tables etc are specified in the app.config ... but apparently this solution isnt good enough.p

Negative 59916 pSay that I have a web user control that has several drop down lists in it. They are all set to AutoPostBack  true, BUT each SelectedIndexChanged event handler in my control will firechain the other SelectedIndexChanged handlers I have defined for the other DDLs. This means that when the user changes a single DDL, the event handlers are chainedfired for several other DDLs. The logic for which events are chained is very complicated, data driven, and can change depending on which list was actually changed by the user. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine which event handler would fire last.p  pFrom the pages point of view, I want to subscribe to a single SelectionChanged Event on the user control that will only fire one time per postback and not until all of the  event handlers have fired. I dont care which event handlers have fired, only that the state of the control as a whole has changed.p  pIm using C 3.5ASP.NET 2.0VisualStudio 2008p  pHow can I go about doing thisp  pEDIT Moved clarification into original description.

Negative 59916 pWere coming to a big release in a web project I work on, and Im starting to think more and more about javascriptcss performance and versioning.  Ive got a couple high level ideas so farp  ol liWrite or customize an http handler to do this for me.  This would obviously have to handle caching as well to justify the on the fly IO that would occur.li liAdd these steps into a custom msbuild script that would be ran for deployment only.li ol  pIm also looking at automatically generating config files for each of the servers I deploy to, which lends itself to the second idea.  The major advantage I see with the first idea is that I could dynamically handle versioning at least thats what one of my links at the bottom says, Ive yet to convince myself that this would actually work.  p  pAnyway, Im curious if any of these problems have already been solved.

Negative 59916 pI would like to intercept the codeOnInitcode of numerous controls on a page. The purpose is to set various properties of the controls at run time. It is critical that the interception happens prior to the start of codeViewStatecode tracking for the control because the property values in question are not to be stored in the codeViewStatecode to conserve space.p  pThere are many simple techniques to set properties at run time, but they do not meet my needs because they happen after codeViewStatecode tracking for the codeControlcode starts. An example of one such technique is looping through the controls in the codePagecodes control tree during the codePagecodes codeOnInitcode method.

The user state including credentials is stored in a so called controller object in session scope which is set from the login validation java code.p  hr  pStack trace from Glassfishp  precodejava.lang.IllegalStateException PWC3990 getWriter has already been called for this response     at org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.getOutputStreamResponse.java676     at org.apache.catalina.connector.ResponseFacade.getOutputStreamResponseFacade.java205     at org.apache.myfaces.webapp.filter.ExtensionsFilter.doFilterExtensionsFilter.java176     at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilterApplicationFilterChain.java256     at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilterApplicationFilterChain.java215     at com.XXX.LoggedInToXXXFilter.doFilterLoggedInToXXXFilter.java61     at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilterApplicationFilterChain.java256     at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilterApplicationFilterChain.java215     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invokeStandardWrapperValve.java277     at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invokeStandardContextValve.java188 .... codepre  hr  pweb.xml snippetp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltwebapp idWebAppID version2.4 xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsj2ee xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsj2ee httpjava.sun.comxmlnsj2eewebapp24.xsdgt ltdescriptiongt     XXX provides a web interface for a given user. ltdescriptiongt ltdisplaynamegt XXX ltdisplaynamegt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtjavax.faces.CONFIGFILESltparamnamegt      ltparamvaluegtWEBINFonlinefacesconfig.xmlltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtorg.apache.myfaces.ALLOWJAVASCRIPTltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt   ltlistenergt     ltlistenerclassgt         org.apache.myfaces.webapp.StartupServletContextListener     ltlistenerclassgt ltlistenergt ltservletgt     ltservletnamegtFaces Servletltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgt     javax.faces.webapp.FacesServletltservletclassgt     ltloadonstartupgt1ltloadonstartupgt ltservletgt ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtFaces Servletltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngt.jsflturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt  ltsessionconfiggt     lt idle time in minutes before user is automatically logged out by the container gt     ltsessiontimeoutgt30ltsessiontimeoutgt ltsessionconfiggt ltwelcomefilelistgt     ltwelcomefilegtindex.jspltwelcomefilegt ltwelcomefilelistgt ltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtMyFacesExtensionsFilterltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgt         org.apache.myfaces.webapp.filter.ExtensionsFilter     ltfilterclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtmaxFileSizeltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegt1mltparamvaluegt         lt descriptiongtSet the size limit for uploaded files.

Note there is a lot of commented out stuff.  I left it in as not to accidentially delete important informationp  hr  pEDIT  Experimented with the sunwebapp configuration file, and found it didnt make a difference.  What is interesting is that after logging in, the login page throws the exception but I can manually navigate to the main page also JSF and see two more pages with functionality fine.  There are three pages in addition to the login page which throws the exception.p  pMy initial thought was that the separating feature would be the ttaglib for Tomahawk but that after a quick investigation does not seem to be the case as some of the working pages use Tomahawk and some doesnt.  p  hr  pEDIT Comparing two jsppages, one which failed, another one which didnt did not reveal any obvious difference which should cause this.  As it was pointed out that there has been reported this very bug with Tomahawk 1.1 and we were using 1.1.3, I have now upgraded to the latest Apache Myfaces Tomahawk 1.1.9, which appears to have resolved the issue with no sunwebapp at all.  p

Negative 59916 pI have some PHP scripts that reside on a network share. For arguments sake, lets call the share codenasdevcode.

Negative 59916 pLets say i have a Domain Model that im trying to make compatible with multithreading. The prototype domain is a game domain that consists of Space, SpaceObject, and Location objects. A SpaceObject has the Move method and Asteroid and Ship extend this object with specific properties for the object Ship has a name and Asteroid has a colorp  pLets say i want to make the Move method for each object run in a seperate thread. That would be stupid because with 10000 objects, i would have 10000 threads. What would be the best way to seperate the workload between coresthreadsp  pIm trying to learn the basics of concurrency, and building a small game to prototype a lot of concepts.p  pWhat ive already done, is build a domain, and a threading model with a timer that launches events based on intervals. If the event occurs i want to update my entire model with the new locations of any SpaceObject. But i dont know how and when to launch new threads with workloads when the event occurs.p  pSome people at work told me that u cant update your core domain multithreaded, because you have to synch everything. But in that case i cant run my game on a dual quadcore server, because it would only use 1 CPU for the hardest tasks.p  pAnyone know what to do herep  pstrongSpecification in reaction to Deltremestrongp  pYou are absolutly right, and your method will work in most cases. BUT, The threads have to update the location of the spaceobject in the Space class.p  pLets say i have 2 SpaceObjects next to eachother, they are moving towards eachother. 1 Object is in thread A, the other is in thread B. Once i update the objects the threads have to write to the Space together to write the new values in the Tile an individual part of Space. That individual call cannot be done in different threads at once, cause the Space object would burst...p  pWhat could happen is a collision, and i could write an Event that occurs if their are 2 ships  1 tile. Thats not the problem.p  pIm thinking that in the case of 10000 ships, the CPU would primarily be switching between threads and not running them all togheter. So in the interest of performance, i want to be able to to everything simultaniouslyp

Negative 59916 pHi My main question is about binding case in the scene that we have multiple sources for a controla combobox inside a datagridor having both datacontext and itemssource. Then how can we know which source the binding will use any syntax to clarify thatp  pAssuming a datagrid has an itemssourceList of Players datacontextManager  , and has a combobox as a kind of column. We also assume that each player has an Inventory property which is a collection type.p  pthen inside the datagrid.columnsp  ol liThe current source of each columnfor binding is a Playerthis is how i understand it so far. We can only bind to the property of the player not to the property of the datacontext manager. There is no way to bind to the property of the Manager. Am i correctli liHowever, if we move to the combobox columns, then assume i will let comboboxs itemssource player s inventory, then the current source for comboboxItem will be each item in the inventory. And if i use the binding, it can only bind to the property of those items. However, sometimes i see the code that we can also bind to the property of the player inside the comboboxs property especially Selected Value and SelectedItem. I am a little confused here can you help meli ol  pthank youp

Negative 59916 pI use a BinaryReader codeMemoryStreamMyByteArraycode to read variable sized records and process them all in memory.

Negative 59916 pOver the years, the more Python I write, the more I find myself agreeing with most of the guidelines, though I consistently and intentionally break some for my own reasons.p  pId be curious to know what in PEP 8 or other PEPs too maybe people religiously stick to and why, and what people find inconvenient or inadequate.p  pIn my case and at work in general, theres only a handful of things we deviate fromp  ul lipUnderscore separated lowercase names, I can see the point of it, as it will unfailingly be consistent, but we tend to use lowerCamelCase, even if it will occasionally introduce some inconsistencies such as partially or miscapitalized acronyms and following words, which are often down to spurofthemoment calls. Mostly because the near totality of the APIs we routinely use use camelCase some upper, some lower, and because for some reason I find it easier to read, and tend to reserve underscores as separation tokens or prescribed manglingobscuring.pli lipI still cant get myself to space things out the way the PEP prescribes inside objects. new and init I tend to leave right under the class with no blank lines as I always want to read them right there with the class name and args, methods that contribute to the same scope of functionality in the class say init, get and set of the same attrib or set of attribs I only singlespace apart, and I like three spaces between classes, and two between methods I wouldnt mentally aggregate in the map of that object. This is, again, purely for the visual impact and readability of the code. I find that very compact contents inside flow control and this kind of spacing between methods and objects consistently leads my eye exactly where I want it to go on rereadings months after the code had been parked. It also responds well to folding in my editors of choice.pli lipSome things instead I stick to, that drive me nuts when I read otherwise written, is tabs instead of spaces especially when some inapp editors we use dont really have tab replacement functionalities, contributing considerably to pollution in the code base at prototyping stage.pli lipOrder of things such as imports, and what imports, globals etc. It really throws me off on files that have large amounts of imports when those are mixed up or out of order.pli lipWhitespaces in statements, especially when people use tabs AND try to align assignment ops across lines with different length in var names and there seems to be no way to persuade those who do it that an excel looking piece of code is NOT neater  .pli lipAnd spacing within a control block, particularly when I see apparently random spacing within the same flow control block, and then similar amounts of spacing used within the object for methods. Im compelled to edit those before I can even start reading the damn thing.pli ul  pSo, those are mine, and the reasoning behind my violations of the PEP some shared, some frowned upon by colleagues. Id be very curious to read what other Pythonistas do and dont do in those regards.p

Negative 59916 pI am interested whether should I manually inline small methods which are called 100k  1 million times in some performancesensitive algorithm.p  pFirst, I thought that, by not inlining, I am incurring some overhead since JVM will have to find determine whether or not to inline this method or even fail to do so. p  pHowever, the other day, I replaced this manually inlined code with invocation of static methods and seen a performance boost. How is that possible Does this suggest that there is actually no overhead and that by letting JVM inline at its will actually boosts performance Or this hugely depends on the platformarchitecturep  pThe example in which a performance boost occurred was replacing array swapping codeint t  a[i] a[i]  a[j] a[j]  tcode with a static method call codeswapint[] a, int i, int jcode. Another example in which there was no performance difference was when I inlined a 10liner method which was called 1000000 times.p

Negative 59916 pOk, I have a control that has an IsEditing property which for arguments sake has a default template that is normally a text block, but when IsEditing is true, it swaps in a textbox for inplace editing.  Now when the control loses focus, if its still editing, its supposed to drop out of editing mode and swap back in the TextBlock template.  Pretty straight forward, rightp  pThink of the behavior of renaming a file in Windows Explorer or on your desktop which is the same thing I know... Thats the behavior we want.p  pThe issue is you cant use the LostFocus event because when you switch to another window or element that is a FocusManager LostFocus doesnt fire since the control still has logical focus, so that wont work.p  pIf you instead use LostKeyboardFocus, while that does solve the other FocusManager issue, now you have a new one when youre editing and you rightclick on the textbox to show the context menu, because the context menu now has keyboard focus, your control loses keyboard focus, drops out of edit mode and closes the context menu, confusing the userp  pNow Ive tried setting a flag to ignore the LostKeyboardFocus just before the menu opens, then using that fiag in the LostKeyboardFocus event to determine to kick it out of editing mode or not, but if the menu is open and I click elsewhere in the app, since the control itself didnt have keyboard focus anymore the menu had it the control never gets another LostKeyboardFocus event so it remains in edit mode. I may have to add a check when the menu closes to see what has focus then manually kick it out of EditMode if its not the control.  That seems promising.p  pSo... anyone have any idea how I can successfully code this behaviorp  pMarkp

Examples include FAMILY, FRIENDSbr USERSGROUPS Which groups the user belongs to. br PARTIES Different parties that have been created.  br USERSPARTIES Join table which users are coming to which partiesbrp  pI now want to implement the concept of a private party.  Only users who are on a invitation list should be allowed to view and register for this private party.  Id like to be able to invite users to this party on a per user basis orand on a group basis.p  pIt seems like a bad solution to do the followingbr 1 Add a field to PARTIES called something like private.  This will either be 1 or 0.br 2 Create a new table called GROUPINVITATIONS.  This would be used to specify which groups are invited to the event. br 3 Create a new table called USERINVITATIONS.  This would be used to specify which users are invited to the event.p  pIs the above a reasonable solution  Are there better ways to approach this issue  As a side note CakePHP has a concept of ACL access control lists, but this only allows a user to be part of 1 group.  This also seems like a separate issue from restricting access to certain actions of the MCP application.  I do plan on using ACL to do this, but in this case Users will belong to one and only one role, which will determine which functions they have access to in the web application.p

Ive downloaded my bad generated VCard to my computer, as well as a good VCard downloaded from a different website.  As expected, my generated one opens with no data, but the good one works fine.  I then created a third empty file with a .vcf extension, and copied the text from my bad file into that empty file.  I opened that file, and all the data showed perfectly.  To test even further, I copied the text from the good VCard file into my bad file, and it still opened with no data.

Its not permissions  thats all identical.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I changed my PHP so that it would force me to download the VCard as well as email it.  The downloaded file opens perfectly fine, so the error is either happening in how Im encoding right word the file, or how GMail is interpretting it. p  pstrongUpdate 3 Fixed strong Figured it out.  Im not sure why this is  because every other tutorial I can find out there says the opposite  but there were a few key changes.  First, I changed the encoding on the email from base64 to 8bit, and I changed the attachment content to just be the string passed to the email function so that it is in 8bit form, not 64.  That made the VCard valid and readable on my desktop.  To get it to read on my android I had to change the fileatttype variable to textxvcard, otherwise Gmail thinks it is a document.p

Negative 59916 pI have the following correct solution to Project Euler problem 24.

For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.  If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.  The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are 012 021 102 120 201 210  What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9  permutations  []  def getLexicographicPermutationsOfdigits, state     if lendigits  0         permutations.appendstrstate      for i in rangelendigits         state.appenddigits[i]         rest  digits[i]  digits[i1]         getLexicographicPermutationsOfrest, state         state.pop  digits  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] getLexicographicPermutationsOfdigits, [] printpermutations[999999] codepre  pMy first query is regarding the use of the yield statement. Instead of defining the permutations list at the top, my first design was to replace the codepermutations.appendcode line with codeyield statecode. I would then assign the return value of the method to a variable. I checked, and the return value was a generator, as expected. However, looping over its contents indicated that no values were being generated. Am I missing something herep  pMy second query is about the final line  printing a value from the list. When I run this, it outputs the values as though it was a list, whereas it should be a string. In fact, replacing codeprintpermutations[999999]code with codeprinttypepermutations[999999]code results in codelt class strgtcode. So why is it being printed like a list with square brackets, separated by commasp

Negative 59916 pWhen selling a nonconsumable item through inapp purchase on iOS, the coderestoreCompletedTransactionscode method is provided so that you can retrieve all of the purchases a user has made in the past, which as I understand it is to give the user a quick way to restore their purchases, for instance when they get a new device.p  pI understand that if you are going to call coderestoreCompletedTransactionscode there is a question about whether it should be called automatically or manually when the user presses a button see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1757467whentouserestorecompletedtransactionsforinapppurchasesherea for instance.p  pMy question is whether its necessary to call coderestoreCompletedTransactionscode at all. If my app has only one or two things to sellunlock, it seems acceptable to let the user go through the standard purchase UI, as long as theres a note explaining that the user wont be charged again if purchasing something theyve already purchased. So, say the user installs my game on a new device. On their old device they already purchasedunlocked Level X. When they get to Level X on the new device, it asks if they want to purchase it explaining that they wont be charged twice if they purchased it previously, and they say yes, and they now have Level X on their new device, and they were only charged once when they purchased it on their old device.p  pIs that a kosher way to handle it, as far as Apple approval is concerned I can see how, if they had purchased 100 individual items it would be nice to give them a way to restore them all at once. But if its just one or two unlocks for the whole app, is my nocoderestoreCompletedTransactionscode approach acceptablep

Negative 59916 pIm currently trying to develop a small finance application. My application needs a quite complex GUI basically a table with dynamic rows and columns as well as categories and subcategories since I couldnt think of a standard xamlway to achieve that, Im writing a custom control that is supposed to display my data.p  pSo long story short, Im creating a lot of different WPF UI elements in C code directly, not in XAML. Now Ill need a way to synchronize some of these components values with dynamically changing data. An obvious example is that some of my text boxes or labels or whatever will need to display the price of a stock. It should thus be bound to another class which provides up to date prices.p  pMy main problem is that I dont know in advance which prices will be needed and where they should be displayed. So what Id need is basically a way for my textbox to contact my priceobject and ask hey, im going to need a price for stock US0123456789. Please tell me that price and keep updating my value whenever the price of that stock is updated.p  pAll databinding examples I found were usually focused on binding to the variables within a specific object instance, but I cant simply bind to, say, PriceObject.Price because there cant be a simple Price variable. After all, theres going to be various different stocks managed by the price object and each text box only needs the price of one specific stock, so itd need to bind to something like PriceObject.PriceForStockUS0123456789. I couldnt find a way to bind to a method, though, and I dont know how how else itd be possible.p  pThe only way I could think of was to have a Dictionary in my GUIclass witch stock ISINs as its keys and a reference to the UI Element as value. Then my GUI could observe the Price Object and each time prices change, and event is triggered and the GUI class could update the UI Element manually, something like pseudo code incomingp  precodeprivate Dictionaryltstring, UIElementgt displayedstocks  new Dictionaryltstring, UIElementgt  private void creategui     Textbox textbox  new Textbox    displayedstocks.Addisin, textbox   private void receivechangeeventofpriceobjectstring affectedisin, double newprice    displayedstocks[affectedisin].Text  newprice.ToString  codepre  pBut I dont know, I feel like this is a sloppy solution. Especially because I wont only need dynamic prices but also other dynamic information like portfolio holdings, which will rely not only on ISIN but on ISIN and portfolio ID, so it wouldnt be that simple with a dictionary. Is there any better way to do it Id be glad to be pushed in the right direction there Thanksp

Negative 59916 pI am implementing an infrastructure for access control of models in a web application. The library has a context class that controllers and maybe views use for determining if the current user has access to a certain object. For keeping relevant information close to the target object, Ive decided to pass on the access check request to the models themselves from the context object.p  pImplementing this mechanism for model object modification is almost trivial. Declare an interface, say, codeICheckModifyAccesscode and implement it in your model. The same goes for delete check. In both these cases, it is possible to ask an instance of a model whether it is OK to modify or delete them.p  pUnfortunately, it is not the case for read and create operations. These operations require that I ask the question to the model emclassem. So using an interface for this is not an option.p  pI ended up creating an attribute, codeCheckCreateAccessAttributecode, and then ended up using this attribute to mark a static function as the interface function. Then, in my context object, I can use reflection to check if such a marked function exists, if it matches the signature I expect, and eventually call it. In case it makes a difference, the method for create access check is codepublic bool CanCreateltTObjgtcode. A typical model that supports access control would add something like the following to the classp  precode[CheckCreateAccess] public static bool CanCreate      return true  codepre  pI am not very fluent in C yet, and I have a nagging feeling that Im doing something wrong. Can you suggest a more elegant alternative Especially, can you get rid of examining codeTObjcode by reflectionp

Negative 59916 pI think I may have discovered quite a bad memory leak in Internet Explorer 9. It seems that when doing AJAX calls to a web service, IE9 leaks memory each time. In fact it seems to leak more memory than the size of the transfer involved.p  pIf you watch the IE9 process in task manager you see the memory usage climb and never fall. The browser eventually uses 1.5GB of memory at which point the application crashes. Obviously this would be a problem if you are trying to develop an AJAX web app that is meant to stay running for days at a time.p  pThis behaviour does not occur on IE8, Chrome or Firefox. I have also tested IE9 with all addons disabled.p  pBelow is some ASP.NET 2.0 code that can reproduce the problem you will need the MS ASP.NET AJAX extensions if you wish to try itp  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeBehindDefault.aspx.cs InheritsWebServiceLeakTest.Default gt  ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml gt lthead runatservergt     lttitlegtWeb Service Leak Testlttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjQuery1.7.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjson2.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                 document.readyfunction                      resultsArea  jQueryresults                                    resultsArea.htmliterationCount                             GetData                                           var resultsArea          var iterationCount  0                          var useJQuery  false          var waitInterval  1500          function GetData                      ifuseJQuery                              .ajax                                              url TestWebService.asmxGetSomeData,                         type POST,                         contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,                         dataType json,                         success ReceiveData,                         error ReceiveError                                               else                                          WebServiceLeakTest.TestWebService.GetSomeDataReceiveData, ReceiveError                                function ReceiveDatadata                      resultsArea.htmliterationCount                             setTimeoutGetData, waitInterval                   function ReceiveErrorerror                        ltscriptgt     ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt         ltaspScriptManager IDScriptManager1 runatservergt             ltServicesgt                        ltaspServiceReference PathTestWebService.asmx gt             ltServicesgt         ltaspScriptManagergt     ltdiv idresultsgt              ltdivgt         ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pYou will notice from the code that the results returned from the web service call are not even stored in the javascript client it merely updates a counter when the web service returns.p  pAlso, this problem occurs when using either the autogenerated client stubs from the ServiceReference or when using jQuery change useJQuery to true.

Negative 59916 pBeen working on implementing a WSGI app that will answer calls for the data tier in a SOA type project.  After working through some example apps for Twisted and browsing the general community consensus, I discovered Werkzeug and its impressively simple routing library.p  pI understand that the easily adapted nature of WSGI makes it so that there are many ways to accomplish essentially the same end.  I am just wondering in general if there would be an advantage to using just the routing library from Werkzeug and relying on Twisted for the WSGI server and reactor loop, or if I should ditch Twisted entirely.  Has anyone experimented with the combination  I should mention that the modules being utilized to perform the business logic in the final app include a ton of blocking calls, so it wont really be practical to make the entire app process asynchronously internally.  More than anything its just important that the engine can be run as a daemon server itself or plug into apache over modwsgi.p  pAny guidance at all from those with experience with these libraries would be greatly appreciated  This is new water for me.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pRevising my question for better clarity as per the comments.p  pI originally came upon twisted more for its roles as a network library than for its expansive asynchronous features.  I had been using it WSGI basic server with the twistd command line tool to test and run a a WSGI application.  There are only a few procedures  within the app that actually need to processes asynchronously, the main thrust of it just has to answer HTTP calls appropriately.  p

Negative 59916 pstrongEditstrongp  pemIt seems that by trying to provide some solutions to my own problem I blurred the whole problem.

The important is that I have multiple unit tests to cover codeGetProtocolHeadercode method covering all situations returning correct header, null or exception and now Im writing unit tests for codeGetProtocolHeaderValuecode. p  pIf codeGetProtocolHeaderValuecode would be dependent on external dependency I would be able to mock it and inject it Im using Moq  NUnit. Then my unit test would just test expectation that external dependency was called and returned expected value. The external dependency would be tested by its own unit test and I would be done but how to correctly proceed in this example where method is not external dependency p  pClarification of the problemp  pI believe my test suite for codeGetProtocolHeaderValuecode must test situation where codeGetProtocolHeadercode returns header, null or exception. So the main question is Should I write tests where codeGetProtocolHeadercode will be really executed some tests will be duplicated because they will test same code as tests for codeGetProtocolHeadercode itself or should I use mocking approach described by adrift and Eric Nicholson where I will not run real codeGetProtoclHeadercode but just configure mock to return header, null or exception when this method is calledp

Negative 59916 pI am creating a Python desktop application that allows users to select different distributional forms to model agricultural yield data. I have the time series agricultural data  close to a million rows  saved in a SQLite database although this is not set in stone if someone knows of a better choice. Once the user selects some data, say corn yields from 19902010 in Illinois, I want them to select a distributional form from a dropdown. Next, my function fits the distribution to the data and outputs 10,000 points drawn from that fitted distributional form in a Numpy array. I would like this data to be temporary during the execution of the program.p  pIn an attempt to be efficient, I would only like to make this fit and the subsequent drawing of numbers one time for a specified region and distribution. I have been researching temporary files in Python, but I am not sure that is the best approach for saving many different Numpy arrays. PyTables also looks like an interesting approach and seems to be compatible with Numpy, but I am not sure it is good for handling temporary data. No SQL solutions, like MongoDB, seem to be very popular these days as well, which also interests me from a resume building perspective.p  pEdit After reading the comment below and researching it, I am going to go with PyTables, but I am trying to find the best way to tackle this. Is it possible to create a table like below, where instead of Float32Col I can use createTimeSeriesTable from the scikits time series class or do I need to create a datetime column for the date and a boolean column for the mask, in addition to the Float32Col below to hold the data.

Negative 59916 pI am using the c STL Map and Vector classes in a program where I have a map that takes a vector as a key pointing to an integer.

Negative 59916 pI need to generate random data for keys, IVs etc. but I cant seem to find the right way to do it.p  pHere is the background  I am developing my server in cc on windows using visual studio and am using the openssl1.0.1c library.p  pI was reading the documentation for random data generation using openssl at a hrefhttpwww.openssl.orgdocscryptoRANDadd.html relnofollowhttpwww.openssl.orgdocscryptoRANDadd.htmla and stumbled onto the following p  pp  pOpenSSL makes sure that the PRNG state is unique for each thread. strongOn systems that provide devurandom, the randomness device is used to seed the PRNG transparently. However, on all other systems, the application is responsible for seeding the PRNG by calling RANDadd, RANDegd3 or RANDloadfile3.strongp  pRANDseed is equivalent to RANDadd when num  entropy.p  pRANDevent collects the entropy from Windows events such as mouse movements and other user interaction. It should be called with the iMsg, wParam and lParam arguments of all messages sent to the window procedure. It will estimate the entropy contained in the event message if any, and add it to the PRNG. The program can then process the messages as usual.p  pThe RANDscreen function is available for the convenience of Windows programmers. It adds the current contents of the screen to the PRNG. For applications that can catch Windows events, seeding the PRNG by calling RANDevent is a significantly better source of randomness. strongIt should be noted that both methods cannot be used on servers that run without user interaction.strong p  pNow, my server does run in an unattended mode so I guess I cannot use the Randevent and Randscreen methods. How do I securely use the Randbytes method on Windows I dont already have a file with entropy so RANDloadfile is out of question and the links on the documentation page for EGD seem to not have an EGD that is supported on Windows. How do I make sure that the openssl random data generator is seeded with enough entropy so that I can then use Randbytes to generate my keysivssalts etcp  pAny help is appreciated...p  pRegards, Web developerp

Negative 59916 pWe are using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comecometricadjangodbarray relnofollowdjangodbarraya module to use arrays in postgres. Ive been doing some research regarding postgres arrays, and some developers have said they wouldnt recommend using a postgres array storing over X values. Sometimes, this is ten, and Ive heard as many as thirty. Is there any consensus on how many values can or should be stored in an array before performance starts to taper offp  pFor reference, the above DB is mainly a read only DB.p  pWe are trying to decide where we should use intermediate tables and where we should use a postgres array.p  pOne additional related question When creating an index against a column in a table, where that column stores array values lets say bigint []. I realize the values stored within the array would not be indexed, but only the array itself Im assuming this is something like a C pointer. How efficient is this compared to simply having an intermediate tablep  pWe may need to create joins against the values or have some of the specific values in a where clause, and I am concerned some of the performance could degrade and we may be better off having an intermediate table whenever we may need to create a join.p  pLastly, given that we are using dbarray, what is the efficiency of that vs simply using an intermediate table with the standard django ORM assume no joins are where clauses from the above questionp  pThank youp

Negative 59916 pI have a basic AJAX form submission function in the head of my page stolen from a tutorial because I cant write this stuff from scratch. In the body of my page I have a bunch of forms with hidden inputs that have values corresponding to user ids that are in my database. p  pThe idea is that when you submit a form, the hidden value is POSTd to my PHP page where it deletes the user with that id from my MySQL database. Its all pretty straight forward and theres probably a much more efficient way to do it but this is the only way I could think of. p  pAnyway the problem is my AJAX function only works with the first form in my page.

Negative 59916 pI have an iOS app thats essentially a long list. Every day new items are added to the top of the list.

Urban Airship is surprisingly expensive 200mo for 0  10k users. The clever third option is perhaps the simplest and cheapest but imposes some constraints.p  pPerhaps the first option isnt that much work. Maybe someone has done this using AWS. Perhaps theres a cheaper alternative to Urban Airship. And theres probably something I just havent considered. All feedback is appreciatedp  pstrongEdit 1strong Assume I add 510 new items every day. And assume I can add the items by 10 AM every day. Perhaps I can just have a 24 hour timer that badges the app w a random number between 5 and 10. The app grabs a config file whenever it starts up so I can turn off the timer remotely. Not sure if the timer would be stopped if the user completely killed the app. Of course the count wouldnt be perfect but it probably doesnt matter that much.p  pstrongEdit 2strong Im wondering how much work it really is to just do it mostly myself. The device tokens can be stored in some table on AWS. I can write a simple script to send out notifications whenever I want. Implementing the feedback stuff might be annoying. But it could probably be done w something simple on AWS. strongAnyone done this and know how much work it really involvesstrongp

Negative 59916 pWith ASP controls, like Telerik Controls, you have the Serverside which is referenced and the markup sent to the client.  I was trying to do something NEW with it.p  pI have an ajax call which would return a json object of a MODAL.  This modal will contain a TreeView.  From what I was looking up, is that if i were to do this it wouldnt actually have a backend to reference, as it is essentially pinging the server for some 1time use output.p  pI am trying to change that.  Whawt my goal is to make the ajax ping to build the TV and then on each subsequent node expansion, return all the children of the clicked Node  Sound easy right  Well, Not from the way I am doing it.p  pMy ajax requests were just going to return a string, which is parsed with jQuery into HTML, and then inserted into the modal.

It wont let me do a toString on the TreeView to put the markup into a string.p  pSidenote  The tree doesnt NEED to be preservced, but if you could take the tree and send it back to the server for an update and then return it that works too.p  pI was thinking that after the tree was printed, i would then, on each leaf, just do an ajax request for TreeViewNodes, or.... something similar.p  pThoughts  Ideas  From what I was looking at, and my thought processes, You CANNOT have a DIV be the target of a webserver for updates.  That is more like a frame sort of thing, which i COULD do.... put a frame IN a div, but Im trying to keep it all looking nice, without frames.p

Negative 59916 pI am trying to get a nice presentatin of a DatTime picker following a hrefhttpcopiesofcopies.orgwebl20100426abetterdatetimewidgetfordjango relnofollowthis approacha. So I have a subclass of MultiValueField with two SubFields and a widget which is a subclass of MultiWidget and which passes the correct css classes to its subwidgets in order to get JQueryUI to mark one of the inputs as a date picker. Now I want to access the resulting SubFields of the MultiValueField seperately in my templates, rendering them in different places in a table.br But I cannot see a way to address them. Which object do I have to refer to in the templatebr Depending on what I use in my template I can access most of the object, but none of them render into HTML.

Negative 59916 pI am about to make a turnbased game in the Monkey language Crossplatform translator. The game will use the HTML 5 platform. This game will play online where players can match against each others It can be a 2vs2 match. I recently reviewed a tons of solutions and i stopped on 2 of them. The good old XmlHttpRequest and the new one WebSocket which seem to be in a recommandation state from W3C which is rather good. There also another technology which i was interested which is PubNub, a push service. This service actually push messages to all clients connected and is really fast.. but this come at a cost later and is restricted in the number of messages you sent. By that i mean it cost you 15 per month for 1000 connections and 1million message then 1 for another 1 million and go on. There actually 3 actors, the client written in monkey HTML5 the server written in C because i know well the language and PubNub for broadcasting messages. The client will only send requests to the server and the server is relaying the messages to PubNub which in return send back to clients. I had two plan in head considering thoses facts p  ol liThe game is written in HTML 5 but i may port it to other languages Android as an example. I cant do that if i use WebSockets because i would have to get additionnals librairies to handle this and i dont want to invest more time in it. So i will focus on HTML 5 for now but porting it is alway an option.li liIts a turnbased game so yeah XmlHttpRequest seem to be suitable for this task but at which point  If i have over 1000 connections sending requests will it be able to support it  Each turn is an unique request but chat messages is also a request and private messages too, getting player data too before you join any game etc. An advantage over WebSockets is that Http Get are easy to make and is supported easily on many platforms so i could obviously go the Android route if i choose this.li liI dont want to invest more time in others technologies than thoses stated here.li liPubNub cost money in the end but it is very efficient for pushing messages so not using it might be risky and would force me to do the messages relaying code myself.li ol  pSo here my 4 plans.p  ol liGoing with WebSockets and use Alchemy as a WebSocketServer for C which i tested and work wonderfully and still have the PubNub actor in the backend for relaying my messages.li liGo with XmlHttpRequests and use a simple WebAPI for the request Gateway.li liGo with both. Make the client independent on which technology to choose. Use XmlHttpRequest as a fallback and make the server support both connection. PubNub will still be the relaying actor here which should make the whole stuff communicating.li liGo with WebSockets but without PubNub.li ol  pSo which route do you recommand me to go and why p  pThanksp

Negative 59916 pI have noticed this very odd behavior in a WPF application.p  pI have a codeMainWindowcode, which is shown using codeShowcode from codeApp.OnStartupcode.

When that modal dialog is opened and closed at least once during the lifetime of a codeSubWindowcode, then the weird thing happens.p  pAfter closing codeSubWindowcode, codeMainWindowcode does not come into view. Instead, whatever random window is embehindem codeMainWindowcode comes into view.

Negative 59916 pI am a total newbie when it comes to programming or even talking directly to drivers. The thing I want to do is hooking up my Raspberry Pi with a 5.1 external USBsoundcard. I would really like to use the Creative Sound Blaster XFi Surround Pro for that but Creative only provides Windows drivers. Which basically means I will have to write my own driver. While I assume that it will be quite easy to do the audio playback I have done a fair amount of audio processing in my life I dont have a clue how to set the USB card volume. I am honestly mostly irritated that the Sound Blaster has its own external volume control which is the main reason for me to use it. Just applying a simple gain factor on the bit stream would be really easy.p  pMy question is Could it be that I would have to just set the system volume and that the volume control on the sound card just transfers values to the USB host which I then would have to make sense of  In case you do not know the Sound Blaster card, would that be the standard way of doing thingsp

Everything is working as expected, but I am not able to take the no.of frames that I wanted 12 frames per second, I can take just 5 to 6 at max per second.

Negative 59916 pFrom the title, you can understand that this one is a bit complicated, but it really shouldnt be.  Im sure this is an easy fix, I just cant wrap my head around it.  p  pI have select box A which populates select box B whose combined criteria populate list A and list B.  When select box A changes, the appropriate info loads into select box B and the lists strongemshouldemstrong also get populated.  Currently the lists only get populated when select box B strongemchangesemstrong.   p  pIts set up so that on page load the first box AB combos lists get loaded.  I need to set it up so that when box A changes and box B automatically changes the lists get loaded for box AB criteria.p  pWhat I believe is happening is that when I attempt to attach any sort of handler to box B or box A really it looks to the previously loaded info in box B instead of the newly loaded info from when box A changed.  I need it to look at the new AB combo.p  pIve tried all sorts of handlers, javascript, jQuery  .onChange, .load, .live, .focus, but I dont think anything will work unless it picks up the new value in box B instead of the old value.  I tried all this in the document ready function in the javascript and also in the .jspp  precodeltspan classcaptiongtBusiness Unitltspangt ltselect stylemarginbottom 20px onchangeloadRatingPlans     namecdebusunit idcdebusunitgt ltcforEach itemsdivisions vardivisiongt     ltoption valuedivision.cdeBusUnitgtdivision.nmeBusUnit ltoptiongt ltcforEachgt ltselectgt  ltspan classcaptiongtRating Planltspangt ltselect stylemarginbottom 20px onchangeloadAvailableLimitInfo      loadBURPLimitInfo      namecderatingplan idcderatingplangt ltcforEach itemsratingPlans varratingPlangt     ltoption valueratingPlan.cdeRatingPlangtratingPlan.nmeRatingPlan     ltoptiongt ltcforEachgt ltselectgt codepre  pThis successfully changes the LimitInfo lists A and B when box B is physically selected.

Negative 59916 pIm new to oauth, so please forgive me if this question represents a fundamental misunderstanding about the way the protocol is supposed to work.p  pIm tasked with modifying an iOS application to display photos from a particular users Instagram feed. From reading the Instagram API documentation and playing around some with their Apigee service, it appears that I am required to login via oauth before pulling down the data I need.p  pIn my application, I dont want to force a user to login with their own Instagram credentials in order to access the photo feed. Instead, I want the application to automatically present stored credentials to Instagram and transparently perform the oauth authentication before retrieving the list of photos for display for a user.p  pIs this possible to implement or is there some requirement in oauth that the user emmustem visit the authentication page of a remote service to present credentials by handp  pIt seems like I ought to be able to simply store read hardcode and pass the necessary credentials to Instagram without forcing the user to a login page but I havent been able to find cases where developers have done so. p  pMy questions are a Is this possible. b Is this a good idea and c Where might I be able to find more information about doing this i.e., is there an iOS oauth library that supports this behavior.p  pThanks as always.p

Negative 59916 pI am writing code for circular buffer in C but am stuck at writing input to buffer when the write wraps up.p  pI take a block of data as input from user which includes number, string, Null character, anything and write it into the buffer.

Negative 59916 pWhat I want to do hide the ActionBar and title bar of the application in the second or two during which the application is launched. p  pOuya android devices have customized ActionBar themes to minimize problems with overscan. Unlike Google TV, ouya devices dont have an overscan calibration procedure, so Ouya devs have added massive padding around elements in the stock ActionBarcompatible themes. This works plausibly well for dark holo, and dialog themes. Unfortunately, the default light holo theme action bars look terrible on Ouya devices.p  pThis is causing me significant grief in the Launch animation, as Im porting an existing Android app to Ouya.p  pSince I need to do a fair bit of customization to accomodate Ouyas game controllers, I thought I would not use an Action bar when I detect that Im running on Ouya. So I call getActionBar.hide, and then load an Ouyaspecific layout with extra features for Ouya devices only.p  pThe problem During application launch, Android displays an empty action bar while the app is loading just the App icon, and the app title, and does so using default themes for the activity, as read from the manifest file. The delay is fairly significant  about two seconds or so, so the flash of the application icon and mangled ActionBar is quite visible. All of this takes place before the first line of code is executed in my app. If I set a breakpoint on the constructor of my main activity, the mangled title screen displays for a full two seconds before the breakpoint is hit.p  pAdding p  precodeltitem nameandroidwindowNoActionBargttrueltitemgt codepre  pdoesnt seem to have any effect. Its possible that Android is display a titlebar instead of a dummy Action bar. addingp  precode    ltitem nameandroidwindowNoTitlegttrueltitemgt codepre  pto the application theme DOES hide the dummy action bar, but causes a long painful series of crashes in ActionBarCompat library code.p  pIs there a nice clean way to control what gets displayed during launch, without subsequently breaking ActionBarCompat codep  precode    ltitem nameandroidwindowDisablePreviewgttrueltitemgt codepre  pSeems to be one way to go about it, although its a bit disturbing, since the launch now just gets delayed for two seconds.  p  pSupplementary requirements I really would like one binary for both Ouya and regular Android devices, so manifest and style changes are undesirable if theyre not going to work reasonably on all platforms.p

Negative 59916 pI am curious to see what error messages are sent back in response by my webapp when erroneous condition arise. The reason for my curiosity is that I want to see what information is revealed to the user in such error messages. I came to know that a skilled hacker use a technique to invoke error messages in an attempt to reveal application logic, structure, page names and expected user behaviour. Such information could subsequently be used to assist with more sophisticated attacks on the application. For example, an application error discloses that the web application is being hosted on an Apache web server. This type of information can aid an attacker in the enumeration of the technologies stack in use.p  pThe webapp have few forms with submit buttons on each of them.

Negative 59916 pI have an SSIS package that runs several SQL stored procedures, file tasks, and an xml and a script task. The final script task sends an email with an html table, and attached excel file, and an email body. I have a variable that is used to uniquely label the excel file on a daily basis as well as to uniquely label the emails subject line. This variable is simply the current date. However, the date was originally hardcoded in the variables value, but I decided instead to add an Execute SQL Task which returns and formats the current date and then populates that daily variable. The problem I am encountering is that when the variables value field is empty, the script task which sends out the email fails. Even when its not empty, the script task fails. It only succeeds when the current dates value is entered  so it only works when the value is equal to the return value of the SQL Task that populates the variable. However, the Script task grabs the SQL Tasks return value, rather than the variables hardcoded value. I know this because I can write 23 august, 2013 no caps in the variables value section and the value that is used in the email and file extension is still 23 August, 2013 capitalized  the exact return value of the SQL Task. My question is, which I have not found much helpful information on in my research, is, Why is this happening Having to write in the value on a daily basis defeats the purpose of having the SQL Task [which populates the variable] in there to begin with. Furthermore, please note that when I added the SQL task in originally, the package succeeded even with an empty variable value. It wasnt until after I had made several additions to the package that I ran into this dilemma. Any comments, suggestions, and advice will be highly appreciated. Thank you very much.p  pThe code for the failing script task is listed below The daily variable I spoke of is named InternalStrFieldingDatep  precode    public void Main              String EmailMsgBody  String.FormatltHTMLgtltBODYgtltPgt0ltPgtltPgt1ltPgtltBODYgtltHTMLgt                                             , Dts.Variables[ConfigSMTPMessageSourceText].Value.ToString                                             , Dts.Variables[InternalStrCountResultAfterXSLT].Value.ToString         MailMessage EmailCountMsg  new MailMessageDts.Variables[ConfigSMTPFrom].Value.ToString.Replace, ,                                                     , Dts.Variables[ConfigSMTPSuccessTo].Value.ToString.Replace, ,                                                     , Dts.Variables[ConfigSMTPSubjectLinePrefix].Value.ToString     Dts.Variables[InternalStrFieldingDate].Value.ToString                                                     , EmailMsgBody          Add Attachment         String filename  Dts.Variables[fileDailyReport].Value.ToString         System.Net.Mail.Attachment attachment         attachment  new System.Net.Mail.Attachmentfilename         EmailCountMsg.Attachments.Addattachment          EmailCountMsg.From.

So here goes.p  pI have a List which contains the location of tokens in a document. for each token it goes asp  precodepublic Listltintgt hitLocation codepre  pLets say the the document isp  precodeJava programming language has a name similar to java island in Indonesia however local language in java bears no resemblance to the programming language called java. codepre  pand the query isp  precodejava island language codepre  pSo Say i lock on to the Java HitList and attempt to directly calculate the distance between the Java HisList, Island HitList and Language Hitlist.p  pNow the first problem is that there are 4 java tokens occurrences in the sentence. Which one do i select. Assuming i select the first one.p  pI go onto the island token list and after comparing find it that it adjacent to the second occurrence of java. So i change my selection and lock onto the second occurrence of java.p  pProceeding to the third token language i find that it situated at quite a distance from our selection however i find it that it is quite near the first java occurrence.p  pSo you see the dilemma here if now again revert back to the original selection i.e the first occurrence of java the distance to second token island increases and if i stay with my current selection the sheer distance of the second occurrence of the token language will make relevance busted.p  pPreviously there was the suggestion of dot product however i am at loss on how to proceed forward with that option.p  pAny other solution would also be welcomed.p  pI Understand that this question is quite detailed. However i have searched long and hard and havent found any question like this on this topic.p  pI feel if this question is answered it will be a great addition to the community and will make anybody who is designing anything related to relevancy quite happy.p  pThank You.p

Negative 59916 pOne of my colleagues ran in some strange problems with programming an ATMega, related to accessing input  output ports.p  pObserving the problem after some research I concluded we should avoid accessing SFRs using operations which may compile to codeSBIcode or codeCBIcode instructions if we aim for a safe C standard compliant software. I am looking for emwhether this decision was righteous or notem, so if my concerns here are valid.p  pThe datasheet of the Atmel processor is a hrefhttpwww.atmel.comImagesdoc2466.pdf relnofollowherea, its an ATMega16. I will refer to some pages of this document below.p  pI will refer to the C standard using a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg14wwwstandards relnofollowthe version found on this sitea under the WG14 N1256 link.p  pThe codeSBIcode and codeCBIcode instructions of the processor operate at bitlevel accessing only the bit in question. So they are not true ReadModifyWrite RMW instructions since they, as I understand, do not perform a read of the targeted 8 bit SFR.p  pOn page 50 of the above datasheet the first sentence begins like emAll AVR ports have true ReadModifyWrite functionality...em, while ongoing it specifies that this only applies to accesses with the codeSBIcode and codeCBIcode instructions which technically are not RMW. The datasheet does strongnotstrong define what reading for example the codePORTxcode registers are supposed to return it however indicates that they are readable. So I assumed reading these SFRs are undefined they might return the last thing written on them or the current input state or whatever.p  pOn page 70 it lists some external interrupt flags, this is interesting because this is where the nature of the codeSBIcode and codeCBIcode instructions come to be important. The flags are set when an interrupt occurred, and they may be cleared by writing them to one. So if codeSBIcode was a true RMW instruction, it would clear all three flags regardless of the bit specified in the opcode.p  pAnd now lets get into the matters of C.p  pThe compiler itself is truly irrelevant, the only important fact is that it might use the codeCBIcode and codeSBIcode instructions in certain situations which I think make it noncompliant.p  pIn the above mentioned C99 standard, the section em5.1.2.3 Program executionem, point 2 and 3 refers to this on page 13, and em6.7.3 Type qualifiersem, point 6 on page 109. The latter mentions that emWhat constitutes an access to an object that has volatilequalified type is implementationdefinedem, however a few phrases before it requires that emany expression referring to such an object shall be evaluated strictly according to the rules of the abstract machineem.p  pAlso note that hardware ports such as that used in the example are declared codevolatilecode in the appropriate headers.p  pExamplep  precodePORTA  1U ltlt 6 codepre  pThis is known to translate to an codeSBIcode. This implies that only a Write access happens on the volatile codePORTAcode object. However if one would writep  precodevar  6 ... PORTA  1U ltlt var codepre  pThat would not translate to an codeSBIcode even though it will still only set one bit since codeSBIcode has the bit to set encoded in the opcode. So this will expand to a true RMW sequence with a potentially different result than above in the case of codePORTAcode this is undefined behaviour as far as I could deduct from the datasheet.p  pBy the C standard this behaviour might or might not be permitted. It is messy in that term too that here two things happen which mix in. One, the more apparent is the lack of the Read access in one of the cases. The other, less apparent is how the Write is performed.p  pIf the compiled code omits the Read, it might fail to trigger hardware behaviour which is tied to such an access. However the AVR as far as I know has no such mechanism, so it might pass by the standard.p  pThe Write is more interesting, however it also takes in the Read.p  pOmitting the Read in the case of using codeSBIcode implies that the affected SFRs must all work like latches or any bit not working like so is either tied to 0 or 1, so the compiler can be sure of what it would read from them if it actually did the access. If this was not be the case then the compiler would at least be buggy. By the way this also clashes with that the datasheet did not define what is read from the codePORTxcode registers.p  pHow the write is performed is also a source of inconsistency the result is different depending on how the compiler compiles it a codeCBIcode or codeSBIcode affecting only one bit, a byte write affecting all bits. So writing code to clear  set one bit might either work as in not accidentally clearing interrupt flags, or not if the compiler produces a true RMW sequence instead.p  pMaybe these are technically permitted by the C standard as implementation defined behaviour, and the compiler deducting these cases that the Read access is not necessary to the volatile object, but at least I would consider it a buggy or inconsistent implementation.p  pAnother examplep  precodePORTA  PORTA  1U ltlt 6 codepre  pIt is clearly visible that normally to conform with the standard a Read and then a Write of codePORTAcode should be carried out. While according to the behaviour of codeSBIcode, it will lack a Read access, although as above this may pass for a mix of implementation defined behaviour and the compiler deducting that the Read is unnecessary here. Or was my assumption wrong That is assuming codea  bcode identical to codea  a  bcodep  pSo based on these I settled with that we should avoid these types of code as it is or may be in the future unclear how they might behave depending on whether the compiler would use codeSBIcode or codeCBIcode, or a true RMW sequence.p  pTo tell the truth I mostly went after various forum posts etc. resolving this, not analysing actual compiler output. Not my project after all and now I am not at work. I accepted it reading a hrefhttpwww.avrfreaks.netindex.phpnamePNphpBB2ampfileviewtopicampp294615 relnofollowAVRFreaksa for example that AVRGCC would output these instructions in the above mentioned situations which alone may pose a problem even if with the actual version we used we wouldnt observe this. However I think this case it stood as my suggestion to implement port accesses using a shadow work variables fixed the problems my colleague observedp  pstrongNotestrong I edited the middle based on some research on the C C99 standard.p  pstrongEditstrong Reading a hrefhttpwww.nongnu.orgavrlibcusermanualFAQ.html relnofollowthe AVR Libc FAQa I again found something which contradicts the automatic use of codeSBIcode or codeCBIcode. It is the last question amp answer where it specifically states that since the ports are declared codevolatilecode the compiler can not optimize out the read access, emaccording to the rules of the C languageem as it phrases.p  pI also understand that it is very unlikely that this particular behaviour that is using codeSBIcode or codeCBIcode would directly introduce bugs, but by masking bugs it may introduce very nasty ones in the long run if someone accidentally generalizes based on this behaviour while not understanding the AVR at assembly level.p

The XML filenames are what I pass to that method in the Bundle arg.p  pI dont get why the ProgressBar callback method continues to work, but the AsyncTaskLoader cant call the onLoadFinished method. LogCat shows that it did the deliverResult. p  pI tried to make the Bundle a member variable, so I could reuse it on the restartLoader call. It start another asyncTaskLoader and my ProgressBar goes back and forth as both threads try to update it. Eventually, it gets an SQLConstraintException trying to add a row to the database that was already added by the first thread.p

Negative 59916 pIm building a sandbox RESTful API using embedded Jetty.  My ProofofConcept design a simple embedded jetty server that 1 accepts connections on an SSL port and 2 uses a ContextHandlerCollection to invoke the proper Handler based on the URI prefix.p  pMy original test, using a simple nonSSL connection, seemed to work perfectly note, code for imports and helper HelloHandler class in APPENDIX.  p  precodepublic static void mainString[] args throws Exception      Server server  new Server12000       ContextHandler test1Context  new ContextHandler     test1Context.setContextPathtest1     test1Context.setHandlernew HelloHandlerHello1      ContextHandler test2Context  new ContextHandler     test2Context.setContextPathtest2     test2Context.setHandlernew HelloHandlerHello2      ContextHandlerCollection contextHandlers  new ContextHandlerCollection     contextHandlers.setHandlersnew Handler[]  test1Context, test2Context       server.setHandlercontextHandlers     server.start     server.join  codepre  pHowever, while testing this, it escaped my attention that browser redirects were happening when I omitted a trailing forward slash, so codehttplocalhost12000test1code  was getting redirected to codehttplocalhost12000test1code.  FWIW, that oversite would later translate to 4 hours of troubleshooting.  p  pWhen I switched to an HTTPS SSL connection, everything went wrong.  Code belowp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args throws Exception      Server server  new Server        Setups     SslContextFactory sslContextFactory  new SslContextFactory     sslContextFactory.setKeyStorePathCkeystore.jks     sslContextFactory.setKeyStorePasswordpassword     sslContextFactory.setKeyManagerPasswordpassword      ContextHandler test1Context  new ContextHandler     test1Context.setContextPathtest1     test1Context.setHandlernew HelloHandlerHello1      ContextHandler test2Context  new ContextHandler     test2Context.setContextPathtest2     test2Context.setHandlernew HelloHandlerHello2      ContextHandlerCollection contextHandlers  new ContextHandlerCollection     contextHandlers.setHandlersnew Handler[]  test1Context, test2Context       ServerConnector serverConnector  new ServerConnectorserver,             new SslConnectionFactorysslContextFactory, http1.1,             new HttpConnectionFactory      serverConnector.setPort12000     server.setConnectorsnew Connector[]  serverConnector      server.setHandlercontextHandlers      server.start     server.join  codepre  pSYMPTOMSp  pAttempting to use codehttpslocalhost12000test1code no trailing slash would cause browser to report that the server had reset the connection.  Additionally, and what I did emnotem spot initially, the URI was being redirected to codehttplocalhost12000test1code not https.  Amusingly in a sadisticsenseofhumor sort of way, on a couple occasions, Id change something inconsequential in the code and then inadvertently test with codehttpslocalhost12000test1code and it would work.  Words dont do justice to the frustration such falsepositives caused.p  pIn addition to the browser redirecting and reporting a connectionreset error, I would get the following exception in my server logsp  precode20131123 135748 DEBUG org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpConnection282   org.eclipse.jetty.io.EofException     at org.eclipse.jetty.io.ssl.SslConnectionDecryptedEndPoint.fillSslConnection.java653     at org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpConnection.onFillableHttpConnection.java240     at org.eclipse.jetty.io.AbstractConnectionReadCallback.runAbstractConnection.java358     at org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.QueuedThreadPool.runJobQueuedThreadPool.java601     at org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.QueuedThreadPool3.runQueuedThreadPool.java532     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java722 Caused by javax.net.ssl.SSLException Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection     at sun.security.ssl.EngineInputRecord.bytesInCompletePacketEngineInputRecord.java171     at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.readNetRecordSSLEngineImpl.java845     at sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.unwrapSSLEngineImpl.java758     at javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine.unwrapSSLEngine.java624     at org.eclipse.jetty.io.ssl.SslConnectionDecryptedEndPoint.fillSslConnection.java518     ... 5 more codepre  pUnfortunately, I spent all of my time trying to troubleshoot this exception directly, when the key clue was in the browser redirected URL.  It turns out that the ContextHandler code has a default behavior which, when no trailing forward slash exists, causes it to just redirect to a URI that has the trailing slash.  Unfortunately, this redirect is to an HTTP URI  so the HTTPS scheme is dropped, which caused the server to complain about the plaintext.p  pWORKAROUNDp  pOnce this redirect behavior became clear to me, a quick Google search of that actual issue led me to the ContextHandler.setAllowNullPathInfotrue method  which turns off this redirect behavior.  In my code above, this is accomplished with 2 linesp  precodetest1Context.setAllowNullPathInfotrue test2Context.setAllowNullPathInfotrue codepre  pMAIN POINT OF THIS POSTp  pI spent 3  4 hours trying to troubleshoot the javax.net.ssl.SSLException Unrecognized SSL message, plaintext connection exception, and nowhere on the web did I find that exception linked to the solutionworkaround above.  If I save even one other developer from the frustration I experienced, then mission accomplished.p  pLINGERING QUESTIONS OTHER REASON FOR POSTING THIS Okay, so I got this code working, but have to confess Im incredibly uneasy about the fact that my incredibly simple proofofconcept test, doing something that I assume would be quite common, encountered this situation which seems utterly unprecedented.  That tells me, Im probably doing something beyond the realm of best practice or, worse, doing something utterly wrong in how Im designing this.  So, questionsp  p1 AM I doing this wrongp  p2 Why is the default behavior of ContextHandler to redirect URIs which lack trailing space  What risks am I incurring by overriding that default behavior with setAllowNullPathInfotruep  pAPPENDIX code of helper class and imports Imports     import java.io.IOExceptionp  precodeimport javax.servlet.ServletException import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse  import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Connector import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Handler import org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpConfiguration import org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpConnectionFactory import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server import org.eclipse.jetty.server.ServerConnector import org.eclipse.jetty.server.SslConnectionFactory import org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.AbstractHandler import org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.ContextHandler import org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.ContextHandlerCollection import org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory codepre  pHelper Classp  precodestatic class HelloHandler extends AbstractHandler      final String greeting      public HelloHandlerString greeting          greeting  greeting           public void handleString target, Request baseRequest,             HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response             throws IOException, ServletException          response.setContentTypetexthtmlcharsetutf8         response.setStatusHttpServletResponse.SCOK         baseRequest.setHandledtrue         response.getWriter.printlnlth1gt  greeting  lth1gt       codepre

streaming out the data from the WinRadio Reciever which is what the DLL is for, but the function CodecRead in the DLL allows one to copy a specified number of bytes from the radios buffer. This is the path I went as I want to control how regularly I take the data and hence why I left the delegate function alone. But with this as it is at the moment, I am loosing the delegate in the wrapper to the GC and I am really stumped on how to prevent this.p  pThanks in Advance guys.p

I could say that if time  0000, then dont run, or use a listener to check if it has changed,             using a boolean value. But this would not really benefit the task much, so I havent. It would also             take more coding, and more complex coding.         else             returnarray[2]  true                  ifpartyvenueET.getText.length  0             returnarray[3]  false             returnarray[0]  false         else             returnarray[3]  true                  return returnarray         returnarray[0]  1st value in array  is used as toggle as to whether the party is ready or not.         returnarray[14] are used to indicate to the user which textbox is empty has a problem.         codepre  pHowever it does not do what I expect it to do when I return the boolean array.

These all work exceptionally well when the target window is local to the machine, however when the handle to the window is buried behind RDP or Citrix I can not seem to work something out and have exhausted all my ideas.p  pI was curious if someone perhaps has done this in either RDP or Citrix such that they can put text from their C textbox into a remote windows edit control via any means I will note that I can get the clipboard to pass its data just fine, I just cant seem to get the RDPCitrix window to paste the information forcing me to manually paste.p  pThank you,p  pChrisp

Negative 59916 pOk.  I have an app that parses an XML that contains links to various documents into a TableView.  When clicking on the table view row, I would like for the app to check if that file already exists in the NSDocuments folder.  If it does, than the subsequent view with a WebView will load that file.  If not, then it will download that file, and then load it up.  The issue that I am facing right now is that the XML contains some PDF files and some DOC files.  I want the app to be able to check for both.

Negative 59916 pI am trying to figure out direction vectors of the codearrowheadscode of an arrow. Basically Im given a normalized direction vector codeu,v,wcode and I need the normalized direction vectors of the its two arrow heads which make a 15 degree angle.p  pMy plan is to first start off with a simple normalized vector code0,0,1code. The direction vectors of its arrow heads are codesin15, 0, cos15code and codesin15, 0, cos15code, and then rotate code0,0,1code so its parallel to the given codeu,v,wcode. I do this by projecting codeu,v,wcode on its xaxis, and getting its angle relative to code0,0,1code, then projecting on the yaxis, and getting its angle relative to code0,0,1code, then I use the 3d rotation matrices to use those found angles to rotate the arrow head direction vector.p  pI have this code below, but its not working properly.

For instancep  precodepublic class ServiceClass  IServiceInterface      public string Name  get set    public class ConsumerClass  explicitly implements no interfaces      private readonly IServiceInterface service     public IServiceInterface Service  get  return service        [InjectionConstructor]     public ConsumerClassIServiceInterface service              this.service  service        static void Main      IUnityContainer container      blah blah DI setup stuff     container.RegisterTypeltIServiceInterface, ServiceClassgt       Key point here     container.InstantiateltConsumerClassgt      Alternatively     container.InstantiatetypeofConsumerClass  codepre  pIUnityContainers BuildUp method sort of does this, but it requires that you have an instance to pass in, and I cant do this if I want to use injection constructors. p  pMoreover, I could usep  precode    container.RegisterTypetypeofConsumerClass,          new InjectionConstructorcontainer.ResolveltIServiceClassgt codepre  pHowever, this is a lot of code to be writingespecially for classes that could have several parameters in the constructorand seems to remove the utility of the container in the first place.  p  pTheres alsop  precode    container.RegisterTypeltConsumerClass, ConsumerClassgt   codepre  pHowever with this one, I dont actually want to register the typeI just want it to be created with its dependencies filled via the InjectionConstructor.p  pSo in summary I want to use injection constructors and I want Unity to do the mapping of registered services for me, and if possible I would like to keep my consumers out of the container. Is there a way to do this that Ive missedp
Negative 59916 pRecently, Im studying codeiwcodes source code trying to understand how codelibnlcode works.p  pI encountered the use of codenlsocketsetcbcode at some point of codeiw.ccode for reasons I cant comprehend. There is no documentation on the web as well.p  pMy first suspect would be to associate a callback function when there is data to be read from the nl socket but this is done in other part of the source code by associating a callback when calling codenlrecvmsgscode.p  pCan anyone shed some light Is codenlsocketsetcbcode redundant p

Its a scriptable input output emulator. It has a set of util functions. Consider this code.p  precodemouse.deltaX  filters.deltajoystick[0].x codepre  pIt takes the absolute x coordinate of a joystick or gamepad, gets the delta value using codefilers.deltacode and sets the relative x coordinate of the mousep  pTo get the delta value my software must compare two samples between script execution, the util functions takes care of this. p  precode[NeedIndexer] public double deltadouble x, string indexer      var lastSample  x     if deltaLastSamples.ContainsKeyindexer         lastSample  deltaLastSamples[indexer]      deltaLastSamples[indexer]  x      return x  lastSample  codepre  pBut to solve that it needs to store the last sample. AS you can see it takes a string that can index the collection holding the last sample. I dont want to require the the user to handle this index for simplicity. So what I do is preparsing the script and look for all methods that has the code[NeedIndexer]code attribute. If I find one I parse the method argument and use that as indexer. so a python script looking like above will look like this after parsingp  precodemouse.deltaX  filters.deltajoystick[0].x, joystick[0].x codepre  pIn this example the code will work because codejoystick[0].xcode is unique, but if the user defines a python function and uses the codefilters.deltacode from there he will index on the same variable name for all samples. p  pThe current code for parsing the script a hrefhttpsgithub.comAndersMalmgrenFreePIEblobmasterFreePIE.CoreScriptEnginePythonPythonScriptParser.csL135 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAndersMalmgrenFreePIEblobmasterFreePIE.CoreScriptEnginePythonPythonScriptParser.csL135ap  pI hope I make this more clear what I am trying to achievep  pstrongUpdatestrong I gotten a little further thanks to Jeffs answerp  precodevar engine  IronPython.Hosting.Python.CreateEngine var script  def fooy    return filters.deltay  def barx    return foox  bar5   var ast  import ast tree  ast.parsescript callbackast.dumptree   var callback  new Actionltobjectgto gt      Console.WriteLineo    engine.SetSearchPathsnew[]  pylib  var scope  engine.CreateScope scope.SetVariablescript, script scope.SetVariablecallback, callback  engine.Executeast, scope codepre  pI have been able to dump the entire tree to a string using codeast.dumpcode but I havent found out how I can recursively iterate over the tree.

Negative 59916 pWhen using codepushbackcode of codestdvectorcode, I can push an element of the vector itself without fear of invalidating the argument due to reallocationp  precodestdvectorltstdstringgt v   a, b  v.pushbackv[0]  This is ok even if v.capacity  2 before this call. codepre  pHowever, when using codeemplacebackcode, codestdvectorcode forwards the argument to the constructor of codestdstringcode so that copy construction happens in place in the vector. This makes me suspect that reallocation of the vector happens before the new string is copy constructed otherwise it would not be allocated in place, thus invalidating the argument before use.p  pDoes this mean that I cannot add an element of the vector itself with codeemplacebackcode, or do we have some kind of guarantee in case of reallocation, similar to codepushbackcodep  pIn codep  precodestdvectorltstdstringgt v   a, b  v.emplacebackv[0]  Is this valid, even if v.capacity  2 before this call codepre

Negative 59916 pIm working on a project that requires me to import lots of data on the scale of tens of thousands of entities into the Google App Engine NDB.p  pThe data is stored in a text file, for which I wrote a parsing program that generates a list of the entities found in the file, which I then write into the database using the codeputmulticode method. p  pWhen I apply this to testing data sets of say a couple hundred up to about a thousand entries, it works fine applying it to the real data set at about 30,000 entries right now, but it will grow, however, throws a codeDeadlineExceededErrorcode. Im guessing that means the program is running too long and App Engine cuts it off.p  pSo my question is, how do I run code that takes a long time to complete while it iterates over a bunch of datap  pIve read something about a task queue or something, but that seems to be more aimed at a short task that needs to be repeated a bunch of times while, here, Im really just waiting for the codeputmulticode to complete.p  pIts also a pretty bad UX having the page take this long to load. Is there any way for me to have my code that runs when the user initializes the data import just sort of kickstart the actual parsing and writing code behind the scenes on the server while the user gets a page back that says the data is being processed in the backgroundp  pThanksp

Negative 59916 pNote This is a hypothetical situation I am creating to understand the functioning of program and malloc in CC.p  pLet us say that I allocated 10k integers and they all got allocated contiguously in the memory. Now, I free every alternate element in these 10k integers. Now, I want to allocate a long integer which requires 8 bytes. Since none of the above 5k locations have 8 bytes contiguously, does the program allocate this variable a new memory location If in future I am going to use only  4 byte locations then am I just wasting this entire memory Or does the compiler take necessary steps so that these remaining 5k locations will be contiguous later p  pEDIT To those who marked this as a duplicate. Okay, let us say that it uses paging and it is taking care of fragmentation by remapping the pages to contiguous blocks in physical memory. Even then, it would mean that in virtual memory all those address locations are no longer usable right So, those memory locations are not usable Yes I understand that this is a problem of fragmentation etc. My question is the followingp  pIs there any way the runtime program might know that this issue arises and somehow try and manage its resources in a good way Since C is a totally compiled language, I dont think this is possible. Does JAVA or C runtime environment do things like this Reorganizing their objects such that they take up a contiguous block of memory in their heap space And if that happens, do they have to change values of every referencing variable Since their position on the heap and effectively their address is changing p

Negative 59916 pI was initially using jQuerys slide functions to slide a page out of view to reveal another page beneath it in a Cordova app Im making, and whilst this worked perfect on my desktop browser, it now understandably was quite choppy on the actual mobile device. So I found out the reason for this and learnt that I should use CSS3 animationstransitions for mobile devices, and more specifically Translate3d for anything that may require GPU rendering. So Ive made those changes like thisp  precodemainpage     zindex 10     top 0     webkittransition all .5s linear     transition all .5s linear     borderbottom 1px solid 111111  mainpage.out     webkittransform translate3d0,100,0     transform translate3d0,100,0  codepre  pand I just toggle the out class as necessary.p  pThe transition runs smoothly until about 50px are left on the screen or the page has about 50px left to reappear, then it stops for about a second before finishing up. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestion as to why this may be the case or if theres maybe an even more efficient way of doing this.p  pThe device I am using has a nVIDIA Tegra 3 CPU with 12Core High Performance Graphics.p

Negative 59916 pIve had many struggles with Unicode in Python over the years as I work with many text files in Japanese, so Im familiar with using .encodeutf8 to get Japanese text back into Japanese display from uxxxx. I am NOT getting any encodingdecoding errors. But text Im reading from a unicode file, manipulating, then writing back into a new file is being represented as strings of uxxxx instead of the original Japanese text. I have tried .encode and .decode in multiple places, and also not using them at all, every time with the same result. Any suggestions are welcome.p  pSpecifically, I am using the Scrapy library to write a spider that takes text from a file it crawls, extracts bits of text to construct the filename of a new file, and then writes the first div of the HTML file as a string into that new file.p  pWhat is even more confusing to me is that the bits of text Im using to create the filename all render in Japanese, as does the filename itself. Is it because I am using str on the div that I am getting uxxxx as the content of my file Please toward the end of the code to see this line.p  pHere is my complete code and please ignore how hacky some of it isp  precodedef parseitemself, response     original  0     author  noauthor     title  notitle     year  xxxx     publisher  xxxx     typer  xxxx     ispub  0     filename  response.url.split[1]     if  in filename         filename  filename.split[0]         if filename.isdigit             title  response.xpathh1text.extract[0].encodeutf8             author  response.xpathh2text.extract[0].encodeutf8             ID  filename             bibliographicinfo  response.xpathdiv[2]text.extract             for subyear in bibliographicinfo                 ispub  0                 subyear  subyear.encodeutf8.strip                 if  in subyear                     publisher  subyear.split[1]                     original  1                     ispub  1                 if  in subyear                     typer  subyear.split[1]                 if lensubyear gt 1 and original  1 and ispub  0                     counter  0                     while counter lt lensubyear                         if subyear[counter].isdigit                             break                         counter1                     if counter  lensubyear                         year  subyear[countercounter4]                     original  0     body  strresponse.xpathdiv[1]text.extract     newfilename  author    title    publisher    year    typer  .html     file  opennewfilename, a     file.writebody.encodeutf8       file.close codepre
Negative 59916 pI have a table with 6 columns and want 3 on both sides to have no border and space between the cells, so at then end having 2 columns with 3 cells on each side.p  pTo keep the border between the rows I let bordercollapseseparate and only set borderspacing horizontal to 0px.p  pBut now the two colums whith 3 cells on each side also have 0px spacing between them, but what I want them to be 2px the same spacing as between the rows.  Setting borderspacing back to 2px results in a small gap within the top and bottom border line.  I assume my complete approach with the bordercollapse doesnt help me to get the layout I want to.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure               ltdivgt             ltligt         ltulgt   ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt ltbrgt codepre  pHere is the cssp  precode.tabs input[typeradio]      position absolute     top 9999px     left 9999px  .tabs    width 650px   float none   liststyle none   position relative   padding 0   margin 75px auto   backgroundcolor grey  .tabs li   float left  .tabs label      display block     padding 10px 20px     borderradius 2px 2px 0 0     color 08C     fontsize 24px     fontweight normal     fontfamily Roboto, helveti     background grey     cursor pointer     position relative     top 3px     webkittransition all 0.2s easeinout     moztransition all 0.2s easeinout     otransition all 0.2s easeinout     transition all 0.2s easeinout  .tabs labelhover    background rgba255,255,255,0.5   top 0   [idtab]checked  label    background 08C   color white   top 0   [idtab]checked  [idtabcontent]      display block  .tabcontent   zindex 2   display none   textalign left   width 100   fontsize 20px   lineheight 140   paddingtop 10px   background 08C   padding 15px   color black   position absolute   top 53px   left 0   boxsizing borderbox   webkitanimationduration 0.5s   oanimationduration 0.5s   mozanimationduration 0.5s   animationduration 0.5s  codepre

Negative 59916 pI have exported a simple model a cube subdivided by 10, then I used smooth vertex. I export the model, so it can be loaded by my engine which expects everything to be a quad. I export it as Wavefront OBJ. The problem is, Blender sometimes exports faces with 4 vertex indexes like a quad, sometimes 3 like a triangle and sometimes 5 or more like a polygon, I suppose. I used Tris to Quads, to make everything a quad, but it didnt work. I tried exporting all as triangles codeTriangulate Facescode when exporting, and it does export all in triangles. I wonder why it, apparently, cant export all as quads.p  pstrongWell, how do I make Blender export Quads onlystrongp  pBTW, probably some people will tell me to change the engine to support triangles, but I guess its too late. Too many things already expect quads. Also, I prefer working with quads, than triangles or polygons.p

Negative 59916 pUltimate Objection Im trying to convert a binary plist file to an xml format so that I can put it in an array and grab values from it. What Im finding via web search on this is that the command for Linux comes from libplist. p  pProblem I ran yum install libplist and it told me libplist is already installed and latest version. Ive read that if I enter the following commandp  precodeplutil i mypathfile.plist gt mypathfile.xml.plist codepre  pThat this will help accomplish my ultimate objection. However, when I do this only a blank file called file.xml.plist is created. Further, with this command and any other command involving plutil, I get a bash plutil command not found. . . error. Is libplist seemingly not installed even though it says it is or why would I repeatedly get this error Thanks for your help.p

Negative 59916 pI have a symfony2 application also supporting REST.  I  would like to hear if it would be a good idea to go over the learning curve of angularjs or stick with jQuery and twig. It seems like twig already has some nice features similar to those in angularjs such as filters and stuff. Also if l use angular it will break symfons MVC since I will most probably have less views . On the other hand I like the responsiveness of angular and its like the new trend.  Can you list some pros and cons in using angular in this scope p  pstrongUpdatestrong Thank you all for the detailed answers but Im still missing the part where you say angularjs is not braking the serverside MVC. In a typical backend MVC we have a bottomup approach where the controller is communicating with the model to prepare the data to pass to the view. So my PostController will pass a list of Pot objects to the view and using twig I can nicely iterate over them and print their properties. On a typical angular application though, its the other way around. We have a topdown approach where the View starts with nothing and later communicates with the controller to get the data needed typically in JSON format to render different parts of the page.  p

It says Controller is a process that manages, controls and monitors Crossbar.io nodes and dynamically starts, monitors and stops worker processes, but not quite sure what exactly that means and what the real life benefits are.p  pI had a look at the crossbar examples at a hrefhttpsgithub.comcrossbariocrossbarexamples relnofollowhttpsgithub.comcrossbariocrossbarexamplesa but cant manage to get my head around because all the examples have the Controller part completely empty in the config.json file.p  pI found a small sample at a hrefhttpcrossbar.iodocsManagementAPI relnofollowhttpcrossbar.iodocsManagementAPIa but still cant understand the purpose.p

Negative 59916 pScenario firstp  pI have a folder named src inside my QT project that contains all the header and cpp files with further subdirectories inside containing further source and header files. This was not my project originally and was done on Windows 7 using Visual Studio. Now it is a requirement that the project has to be ported to Ubuntu. It is not a problem since the dependent libraries are crossplatform and is available on Ubuntu as well. The real problem here is to open the project created in Windows to be opened and compiled with Netbeans IDE  Ubuntu or any other decent IDE. p  pIt is seen that the source files contain include directives with just the name of the header file and does not include the path definition as opposed to what I was doing in GCC all this time. p  pFor example see the image belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRRGY5.jpg altenter image description herep  pVisual Studio seems to do just the file referencing instead of referencing by using full path either relative or absolute. I am really clueless because Visual Studio is not my cup of tea anytime before, now or in the future. I also happen to know that this is possible tweaking the Makefile to achieve the compilation process similar to Visual Studio. Can someone tell me how to achieve this I do not want to change the source with path referencing because the windows team are actively working on this project which is on SVN.

Since the user can go to the next page or the previous page so the class should change from slideInLeft slideOutRight to slideOutLeft slideInRightp  pI tried changing the class attribute directly but the new  element the one which is entering stayed with the same classes as before. I tried using ngclasssomeVar and giving someVar the names of the classes but that didnt work either, Im guessing angular didnt have a chance to update the UI since I changed the properites of someVar right before using state.go to the new page.p  pSomeone has done it beforehas an ideas how to solve thisp

Negative 59916 pI need to have two IOS devices connect to an Arduino via BLE.  I am using a BLE modem connected to the Arduino, and managing communication on the Arduino side using SoftwareSerial.  Im managing communication on the IOS side using CoreBluetooth.  This works fine as long as the BLE modem is configured as a slave.  But my understanding is that if its a slave, it will only support communication with a single master.  So since I want to have two IOS devices talk to the Arduino, I need the Arduino to be the master  correctp  pIf so, how do I do this  If the Arduino is the master, I would need to have code at that end to scan for and connect to the IOS devices, which would be the slaves, right  I dont know how to do this.  Is there documentation or libraries that I can use  And I would be concerned about code size on the Arduino, obviously.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction to get this workingp  pThanks.p

Negative 59916 pI have two tasks that need to be done when a check box is checked. This check box is defined in a DataGrid which is bound to a collection as a data template of DataGridTemplateColumn.  Also, there is a DataGridTemplateColumn with data template of text box. On checked event of a check box, I have to clear the text of the text box on the same row and also set the focus on that text box.  Clearing the text works fine on using the EventTrigger.  Problem is the second part where I have to set the focus on the text box.  TO achieve this goal, I thought to use attached behavior with ChangePropertyAction. For this, I created a dependency property, hoping to get the reference of the datagrid and finding the text box on which focus needs to be set which Ill do later. p  precodepublic class TestDependencyProperty  DependencyObject      public static readonly DependencyProperty         FlagCheckedProperty          DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached               FlagChecked, typeofbool, typeofTestDependencyProperty,         new PropertyMetadatafalse, PropertyChangedCallback      private static void PropertyChangedCallbackDependencyObject dependencyObject, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs dependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs              var datagrid  dependencyObject as DataGrid         get the textbox from the datagrid on which focus         has to set and set the focus           public static bool GetFlagChecked         DependencyObject d              return boold.GetValueFlagCheckedProperty          public static void SetFlagChecked         DependencyObject d, bool value              d.SetValueFlagCheckedProperty, value       codepre  pand here is the xamlp  precodeltDataGrid ItemsSourceBinding FlagCollection AutoGenerateColumnsFalse CanUserAddRowsFalse Margin5                VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto vTestDependencyProperty.FlagCheckedFalsegt         ltDataGrid.Columnsgt             ltDataGridTemplateColumn HeaderNon Kittable Widthgt                 ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt                     ltDataTemplategt                         ltCheckBox IsCheckedBinding Flag,ModeTwoWay,UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged HorizontalAlignmentCentergt                             ltiInteraction.Triggersgt                                 ltiEventTrigger EventNameCheckedgt                                     ltiInvokeCommandAction CommandBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor,AncestorTypexType Window,PathDataContext.FlaggedCheckedCommand                                                             CommandParameterBindinggt                                     ltiscChangePropertyAction TargetObjectBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource FindAncestor,AncestorTypexType DataGrid PropertyNameFlagChecked ValueTruegt                                 ltiEventTriggergt                             ltiInteraction.Triggersgt                         ltCheckBoxgt                     ltDataTemplategt                 ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt             ltDataGridTemplateColumngt             ltDataGridTemplateColumn HeaderTracking No. Width2gt                 ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt                     ltDataTemplategt                         ltTextBox TextBinding XTrackingNum,ModeTwoWay,UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChangedgt                     ltDataTemplategt                 ltDataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplategt             ltDataGridTemplateColumngt         ltDataGrid.Columnsgt     ltDataGridgt codepre  pBut, on checking the check box I get error saying, Cannot find a property named vTestDependencyProperty.FlagChecked on type DataGrid p  pI also tried binding in this way        , but it didnt work  Cannot find a property named FlagChecked on type DataGrid.p  pNot sure if this is the right way to do this.

Negative 59916 pGoal I have an application that allows users to upload videos, and then I need to be able to stream those videos to other users immediately. My current setup works fine for this, but I now want to transcode the videos so they are optimized for mobile streaming. Looking for some best practices, please helpp  pCurrent setup Im using an S3 bucket to store the video asset itself. on successful upload Im creating a separate video object elsewhere with all the metadata for that particular video, including the URL to retrieve it. Note that in reality Im streaming via AWS CloudFront, so the URL Im saving as an attribute on the video object is actually the base URL for the CloudFront distribution that is hooked up to the S3 bucket.p  pProblem Now I want to transcode the videos for mobileoptimized streaming. I can run a background job using elastic transcoder that takes them from one AWS bucket call it bucket1, transcodes them, and drops them into another bucket designated for the optimized videos call it bucket2. But my problem is, now when a user uploads a video, the flow looks like this Upload to bucket1, and create a corresponding video object with metadata. The video object needs a URL so I can stream the video later. I set the URL associated with bucket2 where the optimized video asset will eventually be placed. The problem is, say my batch job doesnt run for another hour, but a user requests that video one minute from now. Obviously no optimized version exists at the bucket2 URL yet, so I cant stream the video. p  pWhat Ive tried Recently I thought, what if instead of creating bucket2 for the transcoded videos, I set up my background job to take videos from bucket1, transcode them, and then drop them back into the same bucket again, with the same file name overwriting the old nonoptimized version. Then I only ever have 1 file per video, so worst case scenario if a user asks for a video before the job has run on that video theyll still get content, itll just be the nonoptimized version. One problem with this is that elastic transcoder wont let me overwrite files apparently I could probably solve this by dropping them in a second bucket, and then doing the overwrite with a copyObject operation, per this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22783502awstranscoderoverwritefilesons3aws transcoder overwrite files on s3a. However, a bigger problem is that this all requires one file name, including extension. That doesnt seem possible if I want to convert files from .mov format for instance to an hls playlist with a .m3u8 extension. p  pIf anyone has any best practice tips to get around the problem Ive descried I would be very appreciative p  pCheers, Brendan p

Negative 59916 pSome colleagues were using an Excel file to keep track of some issues, and they have decided to switch to a better system, asking me to setup a Jira project for them and to import all the tickets. A way or the other I have done everything, but the resolution date is now wrong, because its the one of when I ran the script to import them into Jira. They would like to have the original one, so that they can know when an issue was really fixed. Unfortunately theres no way to change it from Jiras interface, so I have to access the DB directly. The command, for the record, is likep  precodeupdate jiraissue set RESOLUTIONDATE  20150216 144840 where pkey  OV0011 codepre  pNow, lowlevel writes to a database in general are dangerous, and I am wondering whether there can be any risks. Our test server is not available right now, so Id have to work directly on the production one. One thing I had seen on our test server is that this seemed to work, except that JQL queries such asp  precoderesolved lt 20150320 codepre  pare wrong because they still use the old Resolution date. Clearly, I have to reindex but Im wondering whether it is safe. Does Jira perform some consistency checks Like, verifying that a ticket is solved after it is created. In my case, since I have modified the resolution date but not the creation, it is a clear inconsistency. Will Jira complain about this Is there the risk to corrupt the DB And if I also modify the creation date, do I have to watch out for other thingsp  pWe are using Jira 5.2.11.p
Negative 59916 pstrongEDIT It seems that Im hitting the query limit, but Im not being returned a full 200 results. So upon further research it looks like the Google API will let me query 10 boxes, return those results, and then smacks me with an OVERQUERYLIMIT status for the rest. So I figure I now have two options slow my queries, or broaden my distance to create fewer boxes along the route.strongp  pIm currently fooling around building a little web app that provides a details about places along a route like gas stations and coffee on a road trip. Im using the Google Maps API with the Places Library and a hrefhttpsgooglemapsutilitylibraryv3.googlecode.comsvntrunkrouteboxerdocsexamples.html relnofollowRouteBoxera. strongIm generating all the appropriate boxes with RouteBoxer, but  when the boxes are passed to the Places Library Im only getting back some of the places.strong Usually Ill get the first half of the route on shorter routes or a few random chunks for longer routes. San Francisco to Seattle returns me gas stations around Seattle and around Medford, OR only.p  pInitially I thought maybe I was hitting the results cap of 200, but its making a separate request for each box, and my total results often arent hitting 200. Results returned are generally pretty consistent from what I can see. When looking at the details of my network requests and responses, it seems that the script is moving through the boxes making requests with the Places library, and suddenly it stops part way through.p  pThe live app where you can see results and boxes is on a hrefhttpsarcaneisland6450.herokuapp.com relnofollowHerokua.p  pMy JavaScript isnt the strongest by any means. Thats part of why I wanted to work with this API, so please pardon my ignorance if Im making a trivial mistake. The full script is below.

Negative 59916 pI have a serial code that I would like to parallelize using Cilk Plus the main loop calls a processing function repeatedly on different sets of data, so the iterations are independent of each other, except for the use of a non threadsafe resource, which is encapsulated into a class say, codentscode provided by an external library which takes a filename and does IO on it.p  pIf I were using OpenMP, I would create a pool of resources that contains as much resources as I have threads, and access these resources according to the thread IDp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodestdvectorltntsgt ntspool for stdsizet i0 i lt ompgetnumthreads i     ntspool.pushbacknts  ntspool[ompgetthreadnum].dostuff   from inside the task codepre  pUsing Cilk Plus, I could do as much using the codecilkrtsgetnworkerscode and codecilkrtsgetworkernumbercode APIs, but from multiple posts on Intel forums, I gathered that this is considered to be a wrong solution to the problem, and the right solution would be to use a holder hyperobject.p  pNow, the holder solution looks nice indeed, except that I really want to have only as much views created as I have worker threads. That is, for 3 worker threads, I would like to have 3 objects and not more. The justification is that as I say, the resource is provided by a thirdparty library, is very expensive to construct, and I will have to deal with resulting files afterwards, so the fewer the better.p  pUnfortunately, I have found out that instead of making a view per worker and keeping it until a sync, holders somehow create and destroy views according to the logic that I dont understand, and there doesnt seem to be a way to influence this behavior.p  pIs it possible to make holders behave the way I want, and if not, what would be an idiomatic Cilk Plus solution to my problemp  pHere is the program I used to investigate holders, note that it creates up to 50 views on my test machine during one run, that are allocated and destroyed seemingly at randomp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltatomicgt  include ltcilkcilk.hgt include ltcilkholder.hgt include ltcilkreducerostream.hgt include ltcilkcilkapi.hgt  cilkreducerostream hypercout  class nts  public     nts  tagstdtostringid          hypercout ltlt NTS constructor  ltlt tag ltlt stdendl          nts          hypercout ltlt NTS destructor  ltlt tag ltlt stdendl          void printtag          hypercout ltlt NTS tag  ltlt tag ltlt stdendl          static void islockfree          hypercout ltlt Atomic is lockfree  ltlt id.islockfree ltlt stdendl      private     const stdstring tag     static stdatomicsizet id   stdatomicsizet ntsid0  class ntsholder  public     void printtag  nts.printtag  private     cilkholderltntsgt nts   int main       cilkrtssetparamnworkers, 4      cilkreducerostream coutstdcout     hypercout  ampcout      hypercout ltlt Workers  ltlt  cilkrtsgetnworkers ltlt stdendl     ntsislockfree      ntsholder ntsh     ntsh.printtag      for stdsizet i0 i lt 1000 i          cilkspawn [amp]               ntsh.printtag                     cilksync      return 0   codepre

Negative 59916 pI am working in an environment that creates a Pyramid web service on my localhost. From the setup of this server, I would like to be able to spawn a different thread with a different server that manages queues of requests to the main one, and this second queueing server is implemented using SimpleXMLRPCServer.  What I try to do in the server  init  file is the followingp  precodeserver  threading.Threadtargetqueueserver.serverstart     localhost, 8000, True server.daemonTrue server.start codepre  pThe function that gets called when starting the thread is the followingp  precodedef serverstarthostname, port, debug     debug  debug     server  SimpleXMLRPCServerhostname, intport, allownoneTrue     server.registerfunctionkill, kill     server.registerfunctionlistenfortasks, update     queueconsumer  threading.Threadtargetconsumer     queueconsumer.daemon  True     queueconsumer.start     print Serving     while not quit         server.handlerequest codepre  pThe problem is that as I expected the execution of code stops when I get to server.handlerequest, so the original server Pyramid based one doesnt get started, and neither does the process that should contain this secondary server. Is there a way to overcome this Im by no means an expert on multithreading, so the problem could very well reside in how Im handling the generation of threads, any help is greatly appreciatedp
Negative 59916 pI have run into major problems on my google maps project when I integrated an auto complete box and changed my code for a google maps script i have been working on. The map is supposed to communicate with a database and mark cities that have listings in them. When you click on the city it zooms in and marks the listings on the map. Well ever since I got the auto complete box to work I messed around with the map script and the markers are no longer showing up. On top of that I cannot get anything to log in the console through the map script but the map styles and map still appear.

Negative 59916 pJupyter iPython notebook is deservedly known as a good tool for prototyping the code and doing all kinds of machine learning stuff interactively. But when I use it, I inevitably run into the followingp  ul lithe notebook quickly becomes too complex and messy to be maintained and improved further as notebook, and I have to make python scripts out of itli liwhen it comes to production code e.g. one that needs to be rerun every day, the notebook again is not the best format.li ul  pSuppose Ive developed a whole machine learning pipeline in jupyter that includes fetching raw data from various sources, cleaning the data, feature engineering, and training models after all. Now whats the best logic to make scripts from it with efficient and readable code I used to tackle it several ways so farp  ol lipSimply convert .ipynb to .py and, with only slight changes, hardcode all the pipeline from the notebook into one python script.p  ul li quickli li dirty, nonflexible, not convenient to maintainli ulli lipMake a single script with many functions approximately, 1 function for each one or two cell, trying to comprise the stages of the pipeline with separate functions, and name them accordingly. Then specify all parameters and global constants via codeargparsecode.p  ul li more flexible usage more readable code if you properly transformed the pipeline logic to functionsli li oftentimes, the pipeline is NOT splittable into logically completed pieces that could become functions without any quirks in the code. All these functions are typically needed to be only called once in the script rather than to be called many times inside loops, maps etc. Furthermore, each function typically takes the output of all functions called before, so one has to pass many arguments to each function. li ulli lipThe same thing as point 2, but now wrap all the functions inside the class. Now all the global constants, as well as outputs of each method can be stored as class attributes.p  ul li you neednt to pass many arguments to each method  all the previous outputs already stored as attributesli li the overall logic of a task is still not captured  it is data and machine learning pipeline, not just class. The only goal for the class is to be created, call all the methods sequentially onebyone and then be removed. On top of this, classes are quite long to implement.li ulli lipConvert a notebook into python module with several scripts. I didnt try this out, but I suspect this is the longest way to deal with the problem.pli ol  pI suppose, this overall setting is very common among data scientists, but surprisingly I cannot find any useful advice around.p  pFolks, please, share your ideas and experience.

The addition and removal of entities is handled by a different thread, and as you can guess, this results in a Concurrent Modification Exception if I try to addremove entities while also looping through and updating their graphical components.p  pMy ad hoc solution was to simply throw a trycatch block around this and just ignore any concurrent modification exceptions that crop up  in effect, not updating at that specific time. This does exactly what I want and no problems occur.p  precodepublic void update     try         for BaseGameEntity movingEntity  movingEntityList              MovingEntitymovingEntity.update              catchConcurrentModificationException e             Do Nothing       codepre  pHowever, my question is, is this a proper way of handling this issue Should I perhaps be doing something akin to what is outlined in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3814325howtocreatesynchronizedarraylistthis answera What is the correct way to handle this issue, if mine is wrong Im not looking specifically for ways to make my arraylist thread safe such as through synchronized lists, Im specifically asking if my method is a valid method or if there is some reason I should avoid it and actually use a synchronized list.p

Negative 59916 pThis is a follow up question to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32645209isitnecessarytodeconstructsingletonsqlconnectionsIs it necessary to deconstruct singleton sql connectionsap  pAs a few comments there stated it is bad design to use a singleton for sql connection instead of doing multiple usings.p  pWhat intrigues me there though is one statement that the performance of the using variant is strongbetterstrong than that of the singleton variant. Now as stated by me that it is a bad design is clear to me I know most pros and cons for singletons there...especially the cons. What surprised me though was the performance statement.p  pAs normally I would think Ok opening and closing sql connections for 1001000 times during a programs run SHOULD be less performant than doing this only once.

Negative 59916 pI have a question about the scalability of getting the many from a onetomany relationship in parse.com. Below is a diagram of what I am trying to do.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comiiXDj.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiiXDj.jpg altenter image description hereap  pI have a codeLikecode object that has a codeuserWhoLikedcode and a codemessageLikedcode attributes as pointers. My question is in regards to checking if a codeUsercode has liked a message already when loading a feed of codeMessagecode objects. I was thinking that I could write some codecloud codecode that would return both the codeMessagecode itself as well as information about if the codeUsercode has already liked that object. However, I feel like this would be very inefficient. I would in essence have a query for all the codeMessagecode objects which will be n objects long, and then another query for finding if the codeUsercode has already liked that codeMessagecode object by going through all the codeLikecode objects n times and checking the codeuserWhoLikedcode and codemessageLikedcode based on the user logged in and codeMessagecode I am checking. I am going to use the pointer to build the onetomany relationship because the number of codeLikecode objects will be arbitrarily large. Is the method that I have described using codecloud codecode and then checking the codeLikecode objects  for getting if a user has liked an object is okay and scalable Is there a better way, or any suggestions I appreciate your time. Thanks.p

Then it shouldnt be able to affect the original view right This is where it gets weird...p  precode example 2 IBAction func viewTappedsender AnyObject      let currentInputView  self.myTextField.inputView     printlnstarting height currentInputView.frame.height      starting height 200.0       remove the inputView and close the keyboard.     self.myTextField.inputView  nil     self.myTextField.reloadInputViews     myTextField.resignFirstResponder       change the frame height     changeFrameHeightForViewcurrentInputView     printlnheight after frame changed currentInputView.frame.height      height after frame changed 100.0       set it as the inputView again     self.myTextField.inputView  currentInputView     self.myTextField.reloadInputViews     printlnheight after reloadInputViews currentInputView.frame.height      height after reloadInputViews 100.0       open the keyboard     myTextField.becomeFirstResponder     printlnheight after become first responder currentInputView.frame.height      height after become first responder 200.0     gt HOW DID IT GET REVERTED Shouldnt the keyboard use the new frame height   codepre  pMoving onto example 3...  Those with a keen eye will notice i have 2 input views set up. Here I will toggle the inputView between them. Interestingly, if a different view object gets assigned, it all works as expectedp  precode example 3 IBAction func viewTappedsender AnyObject      let currentInputView  self.myTextField.inputView     let otherView  currentInputView  self.view1  self.view2  self.view1     self.myTextField.inputView  otherView     self.myTextField.reloadInputViews  codepre  pApologies for the long question, but Ive documented my findings in this investigation. I dont really want to create a brand new view every time the keyboard changes height.p  pFacebook messengers custom keyboard is able to do something similar to this,  so Im hoping someone can shed some light on this.p  pthanksp
