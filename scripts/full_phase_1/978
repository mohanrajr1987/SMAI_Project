Negative 978 pIm looking for a way to easily load test and benchmark some of our SQL using ADO.NET, nothing fancy using LINQ or PLINQ that has to be performant when running under high parallel load.p  pIve thought of using the new parallel extensions CTP and specifically codeParallel.Forcode  codeParallel.ForEachcode to simply run the SQL over 10k iterations or so  but Ive not been able to find any data on what these have been optimized for.p  pEssentially Im worried that because database access is inherently IO bound, it wont create sufficient load. Does anyone know if Parallel. For is  intelligent enough to use  x threads where x   of CPUs if the tasks it is executing are not totally CPU bound I.e. does it behave in a similar manner to the managed thread poolp  pWould be rather cool if it was sop  pbEDIT As CVertex has kindly referred to below, you can set the number of threads independently.

Negative 978 pIs there any way for a DBA to peek in on the execution plan of a longrunning query in SQL Server 2000  I know how to get the SQL being run using fngetsql.  And yes, theoretically if open a new connection and set the environment flags the same, it should generate the same plan for the SQL.  However, Im in a data warehouse environment and this query has run for 12 hours with a data load in between, so theres no guarantee that the new plan would match the old plan.  I just want to know exactly what the server is doing.p  pAnd no, Im certainly not going to kill the currently running statement unless I can see the plan and know for certain that I can do better with index and join hints.p  pUPDATE I feel so close, but I still think it can be done.  It can definitely be done in 2K5 and later.  If you look at the syscacheobjects virtual table, there are object ids for every cached plan.  You can call spOA methods on these ids, but without knowledge of the object model which is proprietary, I cant get anywhere.p

Negative 978 pI think my question is best described as an example.  Lets say I have a simple model called Thing and it has a few attributes that are simple data types.  Something like...p  precodeThing     foostring     goostring     barint codepre  pThat isnt hard.  The db table will contain three columns with those three attributes and I can access them with something like thing.foo or thing.bar.p  pBut the problem Im trying to solve is what happens when foo or goo can no longer be contained in a simple data type  Assume that foo and goo represent the same type of object.  That is, they are both instances of Whazit just with different data.  So now Thing might look like this...p  precodeThing    barint codepre  pBut now there is a new model called Whazit that looks like this...p  precodeWhazit    contentstring    valueint    thingidint codepre  pSo far this is all good.  Now here is where Im stuck.  If I have thing, how can I set it up to refer to my 2 instances of Whazit by name For the record, the business rule is that any Thing will always have exactly 2 Whazits  That is, I need to know if the Whazit I have is basically foo or goo.  Obviously, I cant do thing.foo in the current setup, but Id that is ideal.p  pMy initial thought is to add a name attribute to Whazit so I can get the Whatzits associated with my thing and then choose the Whazit I want by name that way.  That seems ugly though.p  pIs there a better wayp

Negative 978 pI am interested in implementing an IoC container in my project but I havent seen an example out there that does what I need.p  pHere is the situation, my application is built in WPF and uses the MVVM pattern to create a player for an infrared video format.  In this format, each video is actually made up of multiple subframes think of it as capturing at multiple shutter speeds simultaneously in order to increase the dynamic range of the data that are each displayed in a TabControl.  I would like to use an IoC container to help me create the ViewModels for each of the tabs, but I have two concerns.p  ol lipI need a way to pass in the object that represents the subframe Im creating a ViewModel for so at least one of the ViewModels dependencies cant be created by the IoC container because it already exists.pli lipI have user controls inside the view for a subframe that have their own ViewModels so those ViewModels need to be created by the IoC container as well.  The problem with this is that while the controls and their ViewModels have separate concerns, they are not completely indpendent so they use some coordination objects.  Unfortunately in all the examples Ive seen you can either have your IoC container create a new instance of a dependency or have a singleton, but what I need is a single instance during the controlled scope of time when Im creating the subframe ViewModel.pli ol  pThats a lot of text so heres some code that shows what Im doing and what Id like to do.p  pstrongWhat I have nowstrongp  pIn the open a movie codep  precodeforeach var subframe in movieFile       Subframes is the ObservableCollection that the TabControl is bound to     Subframes.Addnew SubframeViewModelsubframe  codepre  pIn the SubframeViewModelp  precodepublic SubframeViewModelISubframe subframe      subframe  subframe       FrameController tracks the current frame number and fires an event       when it changes     var frameController  new FrameControllersubframe        ImageViewModel represents the actual movie image.

Is there a standard set of criteria that an object must meet before serializationp  pAny other debugging suggestions would be appreciated.p  pThanks, Timp  pUPDATEp  pAfter further experimentation, I think I have discovered the cause of the problem. The target object has events that are handled by another class that is not marked as serializable, as described in a hrefhttpquickduck.comblog20070212howtopreventserializationofeventhandlers relnofollowthis posta.p  pWhats interesting is that serialaztion works correctly, even with the event handlers attached  its deserialization that fails.p  pBut I have tested by temporarily removing the event handlers and both serialization and deserialization works correctly, so I assume this is the problem. However, since I dont have access to the code in which the events are declared, I cant immediately see how to implement the solution described above. It may be that I have to modify my serialization process to remove and then reinstate the event handlers.p

Negative 978 pI am in the process to implement an AtomicStore subclass to save data in a MySQL DB. The system already works pretty well besides the implementation of fetchrequests. The fetches should include the cached nodes but also fire a select on the underlaying SQL db.p  pI have currently only worked on SubClasses for NSAtomicStore and NSAtomicStoreCacheNode. So running a fetch will only result to search within any cached nodes.  As fetched is effectively done on an NSManagedObjectContext instance I would assume that also this class needs an overwrite.p  pAnyway in my current understanding of Core Data I assumed that anything specific for a custom store will be done only in NSAtomicStore and NSAtomicStoreCacheNode. So I looked for something here will should execute a fetch.p  pAs the SQLite implementation is not avail. in source code I digged a bit into GnuStep, here a fetchmethod is injected into the NSAtomicStore. Maybe somebody can point me to the right direction here.p  pThus maybe there are some hidden interfaces on NSAtomicStore to be overridden or the need to subclass NSManagedObjectContext.p

Every time I ask for one, I want a different Blender.  However, each Blender codeImportcodes a ControlPanel.  I want each Blender to have its own ControlPanel.  To make things a little more interesting, each Blender can load BlendPrograms, which are also contained within their own assemblies, and MEF takes care of this loading.  A BlendProgram might need to access the ControlPanel to get the speed, but I want to ensure that it is accessing the correct ControlPanel i.e. the one that is associated with the Blender that is associated with the programp  pThis diagram might clear things up a little bitp  pimg srchttpfarm5.static.flickr.com4042467933877846bed7f0c3o.png altalt textp  pAs the note shows, I believe that the confusion could come from an inherentlypoor design.  The BlendProgram shouldnt touch the ControlPanel directly, and instead perhaps the BlendProgram should get the speed via the Blender, which will then delegate the request to its ControlPanel.p  pIf this is the case, then I assume the BlendProgram needs to have a reference to a specific Blender.  In order to do this, is the right way to leverage MEF and use an ImportingConstructor for BlendProgram, i.e.p  p[ImportingConstructor] public class BlendProgram  IBlendProgram      public BlendProgram Blender blender  p  pAnd if this is the case, how do I know that MEF will use the intended Blender pluginp

Negative 978 pHere is the main problem.  I have very large database 25,000 or so of 48 dimensional vectors, each populated with values ranging from 0255.  The specifics are not so important but I figure it might help give context.p  pI dont need a nearest neighbor, so approximate neighbor searches that are within a degree of accuracy are acceptable.  Ive been toying around with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLocalitysensitivehashingLocality Sensitivity Hashinga but Im very very lost.p  pIve written a hash function as described in the article under Stable Distributions as best I can.  Here is the code.p  precodedef lshvector, mean, stdev, r  1.0, a  None, b  None  if not a   a  [normalvariatemean, stdev for i in range48]  if not b   b  uniform0, r  hashVal  sum[a[i]vectorA[i] for i in range48]  br  return hashVal codepre  pThe hashing function is working at least some.  If I order a list of points by hash value and compute average distance between a point and its neighbor in the list, the average distance is about 400, compared to an average distance of about 530 for any two randomly selected points.p  pMy biggest questions are these.p  pstrongAstrong Any suggestions on where I can read more about this.  My searching hasnt produced a lot of results.p  pstrongBstrong The method suggests it outputs an integer value which mine does not.  And then youre supposed to try to find matches for this integer value and a match denotes a likely nearest neighbor.  I understand Im supposed to compute some set of tables of hash values for all my points and then check said tables for hash matches, but the values Im returning dont seem to be fine enough that Ill end up with matches at all.  More testing is needed on my part.p  pstrongCstrong Instructions on how to construct hash functions based on the other hashing methodsp

Negative 978 pIm trying to dynamically using ajax get some content and create a modal using the colorbox plugin with it. The problem is that the content has some images in it. I think that the modal doesnt count them in its height or width calculation or something. So if you close the modal and then open it it looks fine. The first time you open it, it has the scroll bars to access the rest of the modal.p  pIdeasp

Negative 978 pI wrote a pretty complex Stored Procedure that takes about 2 minutes to run Is is a single Update statement. However, in this 2 minutes of time the stored procedure times out. I was wondering if there was a way to refresh the Stored Procedures timeout expiration so that I dont have to change the servers timeout from 30 seconds. I cannot really break the stored proc up any more than it already is so running multiple smaller versions of the stored proc is kind of off the table. It would be nice to say somewhere in the stored procedure like every time the stored proc successfully updates a row, refresh the timer so that it can update all the rows without timing out. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 978 pI apologize for the lengthy code. I have a simple question, but I thought I include my code so it will be clear where I am coming from. I get a realloc corruption.

Negative 978 pI am writing a self modifying code. p  precodemovq      TARGETCIA, 0x550rax codepre  pThis symbol TARGETCIA is undefined initially and at run time I try to copy a 64 bit immediate value to this location.

A minor JavaScript syntax issue actually  requires that ambiguity between function declarations and function  expressions be eliminated, which can be done by wrapping the function  expression in parens.   The following pattern is used universally to create an anonymous  closure with privacy  function  code goes here     This parens syntax is also valid I prefer the previous version  function  code goes here   codepre blockquote  pThat last part struck me. Can anybody explain why there are two different syntactical versions for invoking function expressionsp  pWas this syntax consciously introduced just for invoking anonymous closures Or is it a byproduct of some other syntactical propertyp  pWhy does the second version work anyway The first one makes sense to me from a parser standpoint. The first pair of parens evaluates to a function object, the second pair invokes this function object. But the second one It doesnt look like its resolving the mentioned syntactical ambiguity.p  pCan anybody tell me what Im missing herep

Obviously, my codeItemsControlcode codeItemSourcecode is bound to an codeObservableCollectionltBaseViewModelgtcode in which it contains for now an instance of a codeFooViewModelcode and a codeBarViewModelcodep  pThe problem is I want to introduce a codeAlternateFooViewcode which I want to utilize the same codeFooViewModelcode. I figure Ill create another codeDataTemplatecode and have my codeDataTemplateSelectorcode return it, but there needs to be special logic to determine which DataTemplate to return I cant just go by which ViewModel is there, and that means Ill have to have some type of property or field in the BaseViewModel. I dont know if thats really a good idea because that seems to be introducing a fieldproperty into the ViewModel that is only used to select a view. It wont hurt my unit testing, but it seems like a waste to include a field just to help decide which UI View to choose. I dont think it breaks MVVM, but Im curious if anyone out there has any other better ideas The alternative ideas I had I dislike even more...p  pIdea 2br   Turn FooViewModel into a base class that 2 different FooViewModels extend i.e. BaseFooViewModel, FooViewModel, DifferentFooViewModel.

Negative 978 pThis question requires a bit of context before it makes sense so Ill just start with a description of the project.p  h2Project Backgroundh2  pI have an open source project which is a commandprompt style website a hrefhttpwww.u413.comU413.coma, a hrefhttpu413.googlecode.comU413.GoogleCode.coma. This project is built in ASP.NET MVC 3 and uses Entity Framework 4. Essentially the site allows you to pass in commands and arguments and then the site returns some data. The concept is fairly simple, but I didnt want to use one giant IF statement to handle the commands. Instead, I decided to do something somewhat unique and build an object that contains all the possible commands as methods on the object.p  pThe site uses reflection to locate methods that correspond to the sent command and execute them. This object is built dynamically based on the current user because some users have access to different commands than other users e.g. Administrators have more than moderators, and mods have more than users, etc, etc.p  pI built a custom codeCommandModuleFactorycode that would be created in the MVC controller and would call its codeBuildCommandModulecode method to build out a command module object. I am now using Ninject for dependency injection and I want to phase out this codeCommandModuleFactorycode, in favor of having the codeICommandModulecode injected into the controller without the controller doing any work.p  pcodeICommandModulecode has one method defined, like thisp  precodepublic interface ICommandModule      object InvokeCommandstring command, Listltstringgt args  codepre  pcodeInvokeCommandcode is the method that performs the reflection over itself to find all methods that might match the passed in command.p  pI then have five different objects that inherit from codeICommandModulecode some of them inherit from other modules as well so we dont repeat commandsp  pcodeAdministratorCommandModulecode inherits from codeModeratorCommandModulecode which inherits from codeUserCommandModulecode which inherits from codeBaseCommandModulecode.p  pI then also have codeVisitorCommandModulecode which inherits from codeBaseCommandModulecode because visitors will not have access to any of the commands in the other three command modules.p  pHopefully you can start to see how this works. Im pretty proud of the way this is all working so far.p  h2The Questionh2  pI want Ninject to build my command module for me and bind it to codeICommandModulecode so that I can just make my MVC controller dependent upon codeICommandModulecode and it will receive the correct version of it. Here is what my Ninject module looks like where the binding takes place.p  precodepublic class BuildCommandModule  NinjectModule      private bool isAuthenticated     private User currentUser      public BuildCommandModule         bool isAuthenticated,         string username,         IUserRepository userRepository                       this.isAuthenticated  isAuthenticated         this.currentUser  userRepository.GetUserByUsernameusername           public override void Load              if isAuthenticated             if currentUser.Administrator                 load administrator command module                 this.BindltICommandModulegt.ToltAdministratorCommandModulegt             else if currentUser.Moderator                 Load moderator command module                 this.BindltICommandModulegt.ToltModeratorCommandModulegt             else                 Load user command module                 this.BindltICommandModulegt.ToltUserCommandModulegt         else             Load visitor command module             this.BindltICommandModulegt.ToltVisitorCommandModulegt       codepre  pA couple things are happening here. Firstly, the Ninject module depends on a few things. It depends on a boolean indicating whether or not the user is authenticated to determine if it will be one of the logged in command modules, or the visitor command module. Next it depends on a string username and codeIUserRepositorycode. Here is where my mappings are defined in Global.asax.p  precode    protected override IKernel CreateKernel              var kernel  new StandardKernel          kernel.BindltIBoardRepositorygt.ToltBoardRepositorygt         kernel.BindltIReplyRepositorygt.ToltReplyRepositorygt         kernel.BindltITopicRepositorygt.ToltTopicRepositorygt         kernel.BindltIUserRepositorygt.ToltUserRepositorygt          kernel.Loadnew BuildCommandModuleUser.Identity.IsAuthenticated, User.Identity.Name, kernel.GetltIUserRepositorygt          return kernel      codepre  pYou can see that I map codeIUserRepositorycode to its concrete type before I load the Ninject module to build my command module try not to confuse Ninject binding modules with my command modules S. I then use codekernel.GetltIUserRepositorygtcode to resolve my Ninject modules dependency on it.p  pMy problem here is that codeHttpContext.Current.Usercode is null. Im not sure how to tell whether or not a user is logged in during the Ninject binding phase. Any ideasp  pHow might I get reference to the logged in user when Im doing my Ninject bindings Or can you think of a better way for me to do conditional binding for my codeICommandModulecodep  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 978 pI am looking at reworking our websites reporting pages to be faster, and I am on the fence about how I should implement paging. Our database is large,  150 million records. Most of our reports require complicated data that comes from up to 5 to 10 tables so each may have 5 or 6 joins and some inner selects. Obviously, they are not fast queries.p  pTo implement paging on the database side, for each web request, I need to query the database for the rows for the current page say 100 of 10,000, but I also have to query the database again to get the total number of possible rows. As a result, I am essentially running the whole query twice because the query to get the total number of records will still need to do all of the joins and inner selects to determine the total.p  pWould it not be better to run the query once, return all results, cache it in session, and page it using web code I known I am initially pulling more data, but I am only running a query that can take 30  60 seconds once instead of twice.p  pThis is kind of a technology generic question, but in case it matters, I am using .net 4.0 and Oracle 11g.p

Negative 978 pRight now, Im modelling some sort of little OpenGL library to fool around with graphic programming etc. Therefore, Im using classes to wrap around specific OpenGL function calls like texture creation, shader creation and so on, so far, so good.p  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pAll OpenGL calls must be done by the thread which owns the created OpenGL Context at least under Windows, every other thread will do nothing and create an OpenGL error. So, in order to get an OpenGL context, I firstly create an instance of a window class just another wrapper around the Win API calls and finally create an OpenGL context for that window. That sounded quiet logical to me. If theres already a flaw in my design that makes you scream, let me know...p  pIf I want to create a texture, or any other object that needs OpenGL calls for creation, I basically do this the called constructor of an OpenGL object, examplep  precodeopenglobject      do necessary stuff for object initialisation     pass object to the OpenGL thread for final contruction     wait until object is constructed by the OpenGL thread   codepre  pSo, in words, I create an object like any other object usingp  precode openglobject obj codepre  pWhich then, in its contructor, puts itself into a queue of OpenGL objects to be created by the OpenGL context thread. The OpenGL context thread then calls a virtual function which is implemented in all OpenGL objects and contains the necessary OpenGL calls to finally create the object.p  pI really thought, this way of handling that problem, would be nice. However, right now, I think Im awfully wrong.p  pThe case is, even though the above way works perfectly fine so far, Im having troubles as soon as the class hierarchy goes deeper. For example which is not perfectly, but it shows my problemp  pLets say, I have a class called sprite, representing a Sprite, obviously. It has its own create function for the OpenGL thread in which the vertices and texture coordinates are loaded into the graphic cards memory and so on. Thats no problem so far. Lets further say, I want to have 2 ways of rendering sprites. One Instanced and one through another way. So, I would end up with 2 classes, spriteinstanced and spritenotinstanced. Both are derived from the sprite class, as they both are sprite which are only rendered differently. However, spriteinstanced and spritenotinstanced need further OpenGL calls in their create function. p  pstrongMy Solution so far and I feel really awful about itstrongp  pI have some kind of understanding how object generation in c works and how it affects virtual functions. So I decided to use the virtual create function of the class sprite only to load the vertex data and so on into the the graphics memory. The virtual create method of spriteinstanced will then do the preparation to render that sprite instanced. So, if I want writep  precodespriteinstanced s codepre  pFirstly, the sprite constructor is called and after some initialisation, the constructing thread passes the object to the OpenGL thread. At this point, the passed object is merely a normal sprite, so spritecreate will be called and the OpenGL thread will create a normal sprite. After that, the constructing thread will call the constructor of spriteinstanced, again do some initialisation and pass the object to the OpenGL thread. This time however, its a spriteinstanced and therefore spriteinstancedcreate will be called.p  pSo, if Im right with the above assumption, everything happens exactly as it should, in my case at least. I spend the last hour reading about calling virtual functions from constructors and how the vtable is build etc. Ive ran some test to check my assumption, but that might be compilerspecific so I dont rely on them 100. In addition, it just feels awful and like a terrible hack.p  pstrongAnother Solutionstrongp  pAnother possibility would be implementing factory method in the OpenGL thread class to take care of that. So I can do all the OpenGL calls inside the constructor of those objects. However, in that case, I would need a lot of functions or one templatebased approach and it feels like a possible loss of potential rendering time when the OpenGL thread has more to do than it needs to...p  pstrongMy Questionstrongp  pIs it ok to handle it the way I described it above Or should I rather throw that stuff away and do something elsep

Negative 978 pI have a JFrame which contains most everything in the application. It has a codeKeyListenercode attached, and it also has several buttons and textfield on it. The problem it, when a button is clicked or a textfield is selected, it gets focus and shortcuts dont work. Of course, one can tab out of them, but to do this you must tab through EVERYTHING each button, each textfield before giving the window focus again. p  pIs there a sensible way to only require one kbdtabkbd to return focus to the frame from the textfield, and no tabs to return focus to the frame from a button clickp  pA WindowListener doesnt seem like the best way to do this, but if its the only way I suppose I can forge forward there.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 978 pI was wondering if its possible to load a bit of JavaScript from within an iframe. It seems that this questions has been answered a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions935127howtoaccessparentiframefromjavascriptherea. p  pHowever, the reason I ask is that the iframe is loaded from an external source i.e. an adserver and then gets the time from the users machine. What I am trying to do is calculate how long is spent on the page when this iframe is loaded and then potentially pass this value back to a server.p  pI know there arent any code samples in this questions but if someone has come across something like this before please let me know. I always thought there would be some sort of security issue with this i.e. calling an iframe on a page and then that iframe running a script which effectively gets something even if its just the time from your machine.p  pThanksp

Negative 978 pOk, I have a page where the data is loaded dynamically from a dropdown using a jqueryajax load function. This allows a partial view to load dynamically displaying a grid with all the data once the dropdown selection is altered. p  pThe problem with this is that when the page loads the first time, so data is loaded, which signifies that no id selection is being sent to the jquery load function.  I attempted to remedy this by adding a load function for the dropdownlist itself, so when it is loaded, it will reload the data view, but to no avail. I figure it is because the control loads before data is loaded in it. But I am at a loss to what to do. Here is the code I have so far.p  precodeltscriptgt document.readyfunction        .ajax             type GET,             url Url.ActionSessionsPartial, Sessions,             data id  ScheduleTypeId.value,             success function data                  SessionData.fadeOut.htmldata.fadeIn                            function       ScheduleTypeId.changefunction           .ajax             type GET,             url Url.ActionSessionsPartial, Sessions,             data id  this.value,             success function data                  SessionData.fadeOut.htmldata.fadeIn                                            function          ScheduleTypeId.loadfunction              .ajax                     type GET,                     url Url.ActionSessionsPartial, Sessions,                     data id  this.value,                     success functiondata                          SessionData.fadeOut.htmldata.fadeIn                                                       codepre  pp  pAs I said, the last part with the load part is what I just added, so feel free to critique.p

Negative 978 pThis is my first wordpress site.  I am creating a local community site and I want to have similar functionality to freecycle, that is users can offer things to other people for free. So theyd need to be a drop down box to say if the thing was a wanted or an offered item. A title field for the name of the item. Then details of the item. Upload an image of the item and a location field, where people have to pick it up from. Also possibly a contact number field.  Plus ideally, Id like a checkbox system so that if the item was offered to someone the user could tick a box saying offered and then the post would maybe get assigned a category of awaiting collection and the text of it go grey and disappear out of the list of posts.  When it was collected, they  could click another box which would then give it a category of archive.  I dont even know if any of this is possible though...p  pIf it is though, how is the best way to do this Considering I want to be able to use these posts on other areas of the site e.g. in a sidebar showing most recent items offered. I also want to be able to add a minimised version of the form which will sit in the sidebar of certain pages, so the user can add an item whilst on a different page.p

Negative 978 pIm attempting to interact with a website that is rather badly coded, and horribly slow. Ill illustrate the problem that Im having with an examplep  pOn this webpage are 2 select boxes, the first one is used to select a country, onchange a AJAX request is made to the webserver, which in turn returns a list of cities. This list if used to populate the second select box. Now the problem is that I can use the evaluate function in phanomtjs page object to iterate over the first select box and select the correct option. But after that I have to wait for n seconds before the second box is populated. Currently Ive solved this by setting a timer to wait for 25 seconds before selecting the city from the second box. This however, is a very bad solution. First of all, 25 seconds is not long enough in all situations, so from time to time it will just timeout and fail. Second problem is that in most cases 25 seconds is way too long.p  pSo I have to find a way to wait for the second box to get populated. At first I though I could just use setInterval inside the evaluate function, to test whether or not the select box is populated. This works, but there is a problem, since setInterval is asynchronous, using this method I lose the ability to find out whether the correct selection could be made. To illustrate what I mean, the code below is how its working when I dont have to waitp  precodevar retval  page.evaluatefunction       return selectOptionselectid,                         info[country]  codepre  pThat selectOption is a function that iterates over the select element until it finds the right option element, if it fails it returns false, this return value is then returned by the evaluated function so I can check if it worked.p  pAnother option is to just do the waiting with setInterval inside the context of the webpage, and then raise and exception if it fails. I tried doing this, but I cant seem to catch the exception outside of the website scope. PhantomJS dumps the exception in the terminal, but I cant intercept it.p  pIs there any way around this Or should I just use the fixed waiting time optionp  pEdit I tried to use page.onError, but it doesnt seem to get used.p

Negative 978 pWe build a product which consists of few components. As we plan to release a new version of the project with some new features we break down work into subtasks in relevant components and plan for versions of components.

Negative 978 pWe have a typical webbased login system. We want customers to have the ability to generate a login link that strongdoesnt ever expirestrong and includes their password. We want to therefore create a link which includes their password in encrypted form. NOTE I know the best way is a lookup table where each link has a unique key... I wont go into why that wont work for us it wont.p  pIm not familiar with public key encryption.. Maybe thats what I needp  pHeres what Im thinking. This still might not be enough, so please let me knowp  pDefinition userpassword refers to the users password that we want in encrypted form in the link.p  pWe cannot use one encryption key for all userpasswords because it may be possible to derive the encryption key by generating tons of links, so...p  ul lipUse a standard form of symmetric encryption.pli lipThe server has a text file with 1000 complex encryption keys.pli lipWhen a link is generated using the PHP script that has that list, one of the 1000 encyption keys is chosen to encrypt their plaintext password chosen in sequence, not at random to prevent the same from being chosen close to the same time.pli lipBefore encrypting the users password, add something like s345lm34l5k342342343534432324sdfs to the start of it, to salt it. Ex password1 becomes s345lm34l5k342342343534432324sdfspassword1. Salting makes it harder to decrypt against dictionary attacks. This salt is kept private. But, of course, theres the risk it can be compromised and its one salt for all passwords, so...pli lipIn addition, theres a second randomly generated salt added to the password. This salt is encrypted with a single strong password. Because both the salt and the password encrypting it is a random pattern of bytes, it makes it harder to determine the salt.pli lipThe link maker tool only lets you generate 15 links every 10 minutes, and then locks out the IP.pli liThe link maker tool doesnt not generate links unless the userpassword provided to it is actual a functioning userpassword combination. That way, if someone is just try to generate links to determine the encryption info, it wont work. Still, theoretically, they could obtain a valid userpassword and try to brute force.li ul  pIs this securep

Negative 978 pJust trying to work out what happens, in terms of threads, if you change the user object of a DefaultMutableTreeNode in a nonEDT threadp  pIm not talking about the DefaultTreeModel events, namely insertNodeInto and removeNodeFromParent, which Im pretty clear should always be run in the EDT... emI think...emp  pIn the case of changes to nodes user objects, it appears that JTree.TreeModelHandler is the thing which is listening for such events... but is there reason to expect that the listener will only be notified of such a change in the thread where the event happened  And will propagate its response only in that selfsame threadp  pObviously, therefore, I am assuming that this is a fairly basic observer pattern.p  pSo does this mean that most changes in the nodes of a JTree must in fact be made to occur in the EDT, at the risk otherwise of things not happening as and when you expectp  pIn the API for DefaultMutableTreeNode it does indeed say that you must do your own synchronizing... p

However, the Android project shouldnt import these libraries as they are Java libraries which make use of some classes which are not available on Android, but it shall import the rest of the code which doesnt really use the libraries, but they are stored in there for convenience reasons and to ensure, that all other projects use the same library.p  pHow can I prevent the JARs from being exported to the Android projectsp

Negative 978 pI am writing mex code in MATLAB to do and operation because the operation uses a library in c. The mex code has a section where there is a function that is repeatedly called in a loop with a different argument value, and each function call is independent i.e., computation of 1 call does not depend on previous calls. So, to speed this up I wrote multithreaded code that creates mutliple threads  the exact number of threads is equal to the number of loop iterations, in my example this value is 10. Each thread computes the function in the loop for a separate value of the argument, the threads return and join, some more computation is done and a result is returned. All this in theory should give me good speedup, but I see that the multithreaded code is a lot slower than the normal single threaded one I have access to very powerful 24 core machines, so this is totally baffling, because Id expected each thread to be scheduled on a separate core. Any ideas to what is leading to this Any common problemserrors in code that lead to thisp  pAny help will be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT To answer many doubts raised in solutions proposed by people here, I want to share some information about my code 1. Each function call takes a few minutes, so synchronization and spawning of threads should not be an overhead here though if there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, any info about that would be really helpfulp  ol lipEach thread does access common data structures, arrays, matrices but the values in these are not overwritten at all. All writes to variables are done to variables, pointers, arrays, etc that are local to the thread. So, I am guessing there shouldnt be many cache misses herepli lipAlso there are no mutex sections in my code, since no thread write to any common memory location. All writes are to memory locations local to the thread.pli ol  pIm stll trying to figure out the reason why my multithreaded implementation is not working  So, any pointersinfo will be really helpfulp  pThanksp

Negative 978 h2The Storyh2  pI am looking for some social integration experts to enlighten me this puzzle here. My web server is using spring security to authenticate user signin,signup. I recently implemented spring social in my web server, all went very smooth. Take fb as example, when user login from facebook, spring social will build outh url and redirect user to facebook. Once user authenticated in facebook, it will redirect them back to my site.p  h2The Puzzleh2  pI need to implement my mobile apphtml5  phonegap having same login capability. I went though the facebook integration page. There are a few way to do authentication for html5 app. I chose the server side implementation a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsauthenticationserverside relnofollowhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsauthenticationserversidea over client side login, because I still need spring assist to check if email exist in my web server, redirect signup page otherwise.p  pThe first problem I encounter is redirect in mobile app, I need pop up window to redirect to provider login page instead of app window. I managed to get redirect url through ajax call and open new window in childbrowser phonegap plugin. Now the problem is when user authenticated through provider, there is no easy way for server to inform user authenticated to client because it is in separated browser.p  h3sample codeh3  precodeonFBlogin function Ext.Ajax.request     url APP.domain  apimobilesigninfacebook.json,     method POST,     success functionresult, request      var json  JSON.parseresult.responseText          window.plugins.childBrowser.onLocationChange  function url              ifurlAPP.domainapimobilesuccess             window.plugins.childBrowser.close                       window.plugins.childBrowser.showWebPagejson.outhurl, showLocationBar true      ,     failure functionresult, request            console.logrequest facebook signin redirect url  result     ,   codepre  pNormally, in spring security if user authenticated through my rest api, client can post request and getting authenticated token through successful call back. I can reuse those tokens for each rest api call. According to above code. I am not able to know if the authentication completed and when should I send token from server to client.p  pId appreciated if you could throw me some idea. Thanksp

Negative 978 pI am attempting to migrate from Glassfish 3.1.2.2 to Tomcat 7.0.32, since everyone says that Atmosphere PrimeFaces Push works perfectly with Tomcat, while it does not work with Glassfish.p  pI already added Mojarra 2.1.4 JAR to Tomcat lib to get pass the error that is discussed in the followingp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10848341classnotfoundexceptioncomsunfacesconfigconfigurelistenerforjsfprojectuClassNotFoundException com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener for JSF project using eclipse  tomcatap  pNow, it seems as though I need to remove OmniFaces 1.3 SNAPSHOT JAR from my classpath, because it is causing errors.

Negative 978 pI have a div which contains navigation items, along with a text input which will be used as a search bar. When the user hovers over the navigation div, the opacity changes from 0.6 to 1 using CSS and then back again when the user moves their mouse away. p  pI want to use either CSS or jQuery to keep the opacity at 1 if the search input is in focus whether or not the user is hovering over the navigation bar. I have tried using a simple if function my knowledge of jQuery isnt greatp  precodeif navsearchbox.isfocus   navbar.cssopacity, 1  codepre  pThis probably works in the sense that it is being appended when the search input is first focused on, but I guess as soon as the user moves their mouse away from the navigation div the CSS might be overriding thatp  pAny suggestionsp  pEDIT I have almost got this working by using jQuery to control the hover opacity for the navbar div, but how do I set up a jQuery function that will detect if the navbarsearch input is not in focusp

Or a Maven issue because Maven should use the same url syntaxp  pBy the way I am using svn, Version 1.7.7 r1393599 and my svn sever says it is Powered by SVN1.7.5 SVNKit1.7.52 httpsvnkit.com t201207240758 Apache Maven 3.0.4 Java version 1.6.030, vendor Sun Microsystems Inc.p

Negative 978 pIm trying to implement RFC 2388 on a HTTP server to support multipart POST.p  pI am looking at the specification specifically at the contentdispositions name parameter. p  pUnder section 3 of RFC 2388 it statesp  blockquote   pField names originally in nonASCII character sets may be encoded      within the value of the name parameter using the standard method      described in RFC 2047.p blockquote  pI have heard that no UA currently support RFC2047 on form control names. They will simply send the text in its original encoding. i.e. if the form controls name is in Japanese using UTF8 itll send the multipart POST request with the Japanese text in UTF8p  pHowever, in the interest of being faithful that thisll one day get resolved. I prefer sticking to the RFC.p  pThe problem though, comes from RFC 2047 itself. Under section 53 Which statesp  blockquote   ul   liAn encodedword MUST NOT appear in any portion of an addrspec.li   liAn encodedword MUST NOT appear within a quotedstring.li   liAn encodedword MUST NOT be used in a Received header field.li   liAn encodedword MUST NOT be used in parameter of a MIME    ContentType or ContentDisposition field, or in any structured    field body except within a comment or phrase.li   ul blockquote  pThe conflict is on the 4th bullet point. Given that the name parameter is part of the contentdisposition field. I find myself lost as to what the specification wants us implementors to do.p  pRegardless of what worksdoesnt work in reality. I want to ask whether anybody find this a conflict as well.p  pI find myself asking also why is RFC 2388 still referring to RFC 2047 for the name parameter but just a couple of paragraphs later then refer to RFC 2231 as the encoding specification for filename parameter. Given that RFC 2047 cannot be used for parameter values which is why RFC 2231 was apparently created. Should RFC 2388 not have been updated as well so that the name parameter utilise RFC 2231.p  pThe bottom line is, should I, or should I not bother with implementing RFC 2047 AT ALL for the purpose of fulfiling its functions for RFC 2388 And should I also even bother with RFC 2231 for the filename parameter Does anybody know whether RFC 2231 is currently used by any UAs to upload nonascii filenamesp

Negative 978 pI have some Java Swing login panel. When user click login button, extensive DB communication takes place. I got an idea to put that db communication into another thread that db communication is used for filling some hash maps and singletons. After putting that communication into separate thread, db heavy lifting takes place while user is typing its uname and password. When user clicks login button, than code will wait for heavy lifting thread to join, and then proceed.p  pThe problem is that while my code is waiting for db thread to join, it seems that no UI updates can be done. I dont think i can use SwingWorker for db communication because user can click login button any time, even before SW would finish and i dont have a way to join SwingWorker db communication has to take place BEFORE actual login.p  pIs there a way to enable Swing ui updates while waiting for another thread to join Am i missing somethingp

The final argument the app descriptor appears to be being ignored at the moment if I change it to a path that does not exist there is no error which leads me to think that the xml inside that app descriptor is not the culprit.p  pIve deleted adl.plist and com.adobe.adl.plist from my library. mm.cfg contains nothing interesting.p  pI have also just to see tried launching with nodebug but that makes no difference.p  pThe app is a Desktop application.p  pEdit I just tried launch a different Air app with the same silent result.p  pFurther Edit The exit code obtained from echo  is 1.

Negative 978 h2Prior Knowledgeh2  pIve read and understand a bit about stacks and data structures, but couldnt find the answer to this specific question. I know that any programmer worth anything will implement security exception handling beyond the default in their programs.p  h2Situationh2  pI would like to understand how a program could be written in C that establishes a relatively robust stack with exception handling for some arbitrary case S. My goal is to discern from this very specific information why from what I understand it is always possible to exploit the SEH in a program and execute arbitrary code.p  pThe issue is strongnotstrong that I do not understand the concept of overflowing a buffer  I do not understand strongwhy in very specific, CPU architecture related reasons the security implemented on the stack canaries, etc cannot sufficiently address these issuesstrong like heap overflows cannot be stopped.p  h2Reference Informationh2  pThere is no sane way to alter the layout of data within a structure structures are expected to be the same between modules, especially with shared libraries. Any data in a structure after a buffer is impossible to protect with canaries thus, programmers must be very careful about how they organize their variables and use their structures. In C and C, structures with buffers should either be malloced or obtained with new.  via a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBufferoverflowprotectionImplementations relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBufferoverflowprotectionImplementationsap  pAlsop  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combmichaelhowardarchive20060816702707.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combmichaelhowardarchive20060816702707.aspxap  pIf anyone knows a good emresource for understandingem this material or can provide a emcode snippetem, I would be very grateful.p

Any function declared in a header may be additionally implemented as a functionlike macro defined in the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by such a macro.

Negative 978 pMy understanding of the Android lifecycle model is that when codeonPausecode is called I should save any state that needs to be saved, because my app could be terminated at any point after I return.  Im targeting Gingerbread, so codeonStopcode might never be called.p  pHowever in my app some state is being saved on a remote server.  I periodically flush this state but if onPause is called I am not sure the correct thing to do, because my understanding is that as soon as onPause returns my app could be killed.  Since I have to run the android http request in another thread this seems problematic if I start the request in onPause then return, then my app might be killed before the remote request to save the state completes or even starts.  p  pI am thinking I should put some sort of synchronization where I go to sleep and wait for the request to work, but first Im not sure I can even do this in onPause, and second, onPause isnt supposed to take very long to complete so if there is network delay this could cause issues as well.p  pIs there some recommended way of saving state in onPause when the state needs to be flushed to a remote server or in general by some method that requires a separate threadp

The call was made directly after the modification, e.g.p  precodeem.mergeu cacheMan.invalidateCacheForQuery...  for each cached query codepre  pIm cutting corners here a bit, this is the essence of what I was doing.p  pThe above solution worked well  I have JUnit tests that will fail if the cache is not cleared, and they do not fail if the above invalidateCacheForQuery calls are present and do fail if they are not.p  pThen I tried to make my life easier by defining an interceptorp  precodeEJB CacheManager cacheMan  AroundInvoke public Object clearQueryCacheAfterwardsInvocationContext ctx         throws Exception        this does something like em.persist that might make cached query results      invalid     final Object result  ctx.proceed        hera are calls cacheMan.invalidateCacheForQuery for all of the relevant named      queries. Yes, this is done after ctx.proceed.      return result  codepre  pNote I kept the code above terse The interceptor annotation accepted a Class object as its parameter, and I used the class object to find all its NamedQueries names that had a QueryHint indicating that they were cached. This is just to explain how I found what named queries to clear.p  pThe Interceptor approach does not work, and I have no idea why. strongI know the method codeinvalidateCacheForQueryString namedQueryNamecode gets called also with the Interceptor approach with the right named query names as I get the correct log messages.strong I also get log messages form the interceptor. Therfore the Interceptor mechanism is working, e.g. it is not a simple problem like definition missing from beans.xml. However, I know cache clearing does not work because my JUnit tests fail the same way they fail if I did not clear the cache at all.p  pLooking at the log, these consecutive lines make me sure the interceptor is doing what it shouldp  precodeClearQueryCacheInterceptor clearing query cache for named query User.findAll  CacheManagerService clearing cache for named query User.findAll codepre  pI also tried to use codePersistenceContextunitName... EntiytyManager emcode in the interceptor and clear the cache through that without using the CacheManager EJB.p  pSo to recap the lenghty explanation I have two approaches calling the same method that invalidates EclipseLinks query result cache. I have verified through logging that both approaches manage to call that method with the same parameters NamedQuery names. The inline after em.persist way works, but doing essentially exactly the same thing in interceptor does not. It kind of feels like Im clearing another instance of EclipseLinks cache with the interceptor, but I dont know how thatd be possible.p

Negative 978 pHi I have a basic expandable tree navigation that is driven by jquery. Id like to be able to remember the state of the menu when the user navigates to a new page as at the moment it collapses back to its original closed state. Here is my jquery for the tree navigationp  precodedocument.readyfunction   ul li.parent.children.closed.addClassexpand  .treenav li a.expand.toggle                   function   START FIRST CLICK FUNCTION           this.siblingsul.slideDown           if this.hasClassclosed                   this.removeClassclosed.addClassopen                  ,  END FIRST CLICK FUNCTION        function   START SECOND CLICK FUNCTION           this.siblingsul.slideUp            if this.hasClassopen                this.removeClassopen.addClassclosed                    END SECOND CLICK FUNCTIOn   END TOGGLE FUNCTION    END DOCUMENT READY codepre  pBasically Im just adding a class of open when a link is clicked and animating on that class.

Negative 978 pIm new to CMake and I have a problem that I can not figure out a solution to. Im using CMake to compile a project with a bunch of optional subdirs and it builds shared library files as expected. That part seems to be working fine. Each of these subdirs contains a sql file. I need to concat all the selected sql files to one sql header file and install the result. So one file likep  precodesqlheader.sql subdirA.sql subdirC.sql subdirD.sql codepre  pIf I did this directly in a make file I might do something like the following only smarter to deal with only the selected subdirsp  precodecat sqlheader.sql  gt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql cat subdirA.sql  gtgt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql cat subdirC.sql  gtgt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql cat subdirD.sql  gtgt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql codepre  pI have sort of figured out pieces of this, like I can usep  precodeLISTAPPEND PACKAGESQLFILES somefile.sql codepre  pwhich I assume I can place in each of the subdirs CMakeLists.txt files to collect the file names. And I can create a macro likep  precodeCATIN PACKAGESQLFILES OUT INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql codepre  pBut I am lost between when the CMake initially runs and when it runs from the make install. Maybe there is a better way to do this. I need this to work on both Windows and Linux.p  pI would be happy with some hints to point me in the right direction.p

Negative 978 pBackground  I use PHPStylist to indent PHP code, which is generally working out fine. But, when it find function calls with many arguments, it puts all these arguments on one single line. So for instance a codebindparamcode call can easily be 300 characters wide.p  pThis does not play well with our coding style guide, which dictates a maximum line length of 180 characters.p  pOur indent script already has a sed command to clean off trailing whitespace left by PHPStylist, so I was thinking, can sed also break too long lines, but only on a comma p  pExample inputp  precodefunction xyz      somecallsomevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1  codepre  pExample outputp  precodefunction xyz      somecallsomevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1, somevariable1  codepre  psup Bonus points if the script could also indent the next line prettily, but I think that would be very hard to do in sed.

The private implementation class is shown below.p  precodeclass TestImpl public boostenablesharedfromthisltTestImplgt, boostnoncopyable      TestImpl updatetimeriosvc, signalsiosvc, SIGINT, SIGTERM          signals.asyncwaitboostbindampboostasioioservicestop, ampiosvc        public     virtual TestImpl           stdcout ltlt Destroyed. ltlt stdendl           static boostsharedptrltTestImplgt create          boostsharedptrltTestImplgt ptrnew TestImpl         ptrgtstart         return ptr           void start          updatetimer.expiresfromnowboostposixtimeseconds1         updatetimer.asyncwaitboostbindampTestImplupdate, sharedfromthis              runthread  boostthreadboostbindampTestImplrun, sharedfromthis           void cleanup          runthread.join       private     void run          iosvc.run           void update          stdcout ltlt Updating. ltlt stdendl         updatetimer.expiresfromnowboostposixtimeseconds1         updatetimer.asyncwaitboostbindampTestImplupdate, sharedfromthis               boostasioioservice iosvc     boostasiodeadlinetimer updatetimer     boostthread runthread     boostasiosignalset signals  codepre  pHere is the code that is using the private implementation.p  precodeclass Test  public     Test implTestImplcreate       virtual Test  stdcout ltlt Destroyed. ltlt stdendl      int run          boostasiosignalset signalsiosvc, SIGINT, SIGTERM         signals.asyncwaitboostbindampboostasioioservicestop, ampiosvc          iosvc.run          implgtcleanup          return 0      private     boostasioioservice iosvc     boostsharedptrltTestImplgt impl   int main      Test test     test.run  codepre  pI am having trouble understanding why the TestImpl class gets leaked. By debugging I can verify that both ioservice instances are stopped upon SIGINT and that the thread gets joined, which leads me to believe that it does not get detached upon destruction. It seems like there must be a circular reference somewhere that is causing the TestImpl instance to persistp

Negative 978 pI am writing for Arduino and I use the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIC2B2C relnofollowICa protocol. When codeWire.readcode returns an int, what is this int Is it signed or unsignedp  pAt the Arduino official site it says that it returns a byte. So I think it is unsigned because they do not say sbyte or signed byte. If the register I read with codeWire.readcode has values signed that are saved with the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTwo27scomplement relnofollowtwos complementa method, how can codeWire.readcode understand itp  pIs the return value always signed Or does it dependp  pAlso, by reading and printing the value I get negative numbers, so that means that codewire.readcode returns an signed int. p

Negative 978 pI have various scenarios in loops where I would peek or skip ahead while iterating through items for processing.   p  pOne scenario is Im enumerating through lines of a file, and there is a continuation character at the end of a line indicating to combine the next line with the current line.  If Im simply looping that isnt too hard, I can just read the next line, and bump my counterindex.p  pIt isnt as obvious is the pattern for doing this with my iterator.  I effectively want to consume the next lines without exiting my closure.  But Im not even sure if that is possible.   Are there any good design pattern for this iteration pattern using a closure, so I dont have to resort to a less groovy loop   Is it perhaps a form of iterator with some stack for pushingpopping items for processingp

Each input string should be a UNIX command, with arguments allowed. For example, input 1 could be ls l and input 2 could be wc l. The program will then create a pipe, and two child processes. The first child process will run the command specified in the first input. It will output to the pipe instead of standard output. The second child process will run the command specified in the second input. It will take its input from the pipe rather than standard input.

Negative 978 pAfter reading several CiA specifications, I am still having difficulty understanding PDO mapping, Process Image, and Process Data Exchange in CANopen.p  pI know emSDOem is used for configuration settings in the preoperational state and has protocol overhead since it can transfer more than 8 bytes of data.p  pIn operational state, PDOs are well suited for inputs and outputs of process data. PDOs can transfer a maximum 8 bytes of data only.p  pThere is the COBID of 11 bits which has a function code and a node number. Since the node number uses 7 bits, we can have a maximum of 127 nodes for CANopen 2.0A network.p  pBut there are four TPDOs and four RPDOs which is confusing me. Why would you need multiple TPDOs and RPDOs Also somewhere I read the device profiles may use entries from 6000h to 6FFFh to describe the device parameters and the device functionality and within this range up to 8 different devices can be described. But there can be 127 nodes in network then whats this 8 devicep

Negative 978 pIn ActionScript3 in my level editor I have for each level a new object. Old level objects are removed from stage. So only 1 level object is at stage. I dont keep them in an array or something hoping that garbage collection disposes them for me. My problem seems to be that methods of old objects are still referenced by event listeners that would fire events to the new object and also to the old ones. Old objects are not on stage and therefore invisible but when saving I notice that the old levels have a state caused by editing a newer level.p  pNow How can I dispose my objects strongfor surestrong p  pedit I also have some event listeners added to stage KeyDown, MouseMove. Might those few be the problem and others that are just added to the object are removed with the object automatically p

Negative 978 pI am reading in 25 mb large txt files into nsstrings that I want to present in a uitextview.p  pNow I have experienced that it takes too long to read in the whole string especially since I am removing line breaks every time. p  pSo I have decided separate the codeNSStringcode into individual pages that I can navigate by two buttons previous and next. The first thing I did was to decide to separate the codeNSStringcode into 500 characters long substrings then I remove line breaks before I present the string. p  pNow this works great and is fast enough, but there is one little problem that annoys me, the last word in the substring that is presented oftentimes gets cut off in the middle. p  pSo what I did then was instead of using 500 characters to separate the substrings, to use 20 dotsperiods . . This turned out to work very good also until I realized that not all txt files and texts that might be loaded will contain dotsperiods because some languages might not have dots.p  pSo I am looking for a solution where I can separate long text files into smaller substrings, about a page long, that I can navigate and that do not cut off the last word in the the substring in half. Any help would be appreciated. p  pAlso I should add that I have tried to separate after x number words i.e. x number white spaces which I think might be the best solution but I cannot think of any other way but codecomponentsSeparatedByString. code which takes to long because it goes through the whole string. p  pIs there some good way of enumerating a string but that still allows be to navigate through pages, perhaps by saving the substring range location or somethingp

So far I came up to this, but Im just not sure whether this is a propersafe way to do this.p  precodeltphp  db  new PDOmysqlhostHOSTdbnameDATABASEcharsetUTF8,                USERNAME,                PASSWORD,               arrayPDOATTREMULATEPREPARES gt false,               PDOATTRERRMODE gt PDOERRMODEEXCEPTION  ifissetPOST[username] ampamp issetPOST[password]   select  dbgtprepareSELECT id, username FROM vwo5users WHERE usernameusername AND passwordpassword   selectgtexecutearrayusername gt POST[username], password gt POST[password]   amount  selectgtrowCount   result  selectgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC   userid  result[id]   username  result[username]     ifamount gt 1     sessionstart     SESSION[userid]  userid     SESSION[username]  username     echo Logged in      else     echo Wrong login data       else     headerLocation dbtestform.php   gt codepre  pI would then check at a secured page whether the emidem and emusernameem from the session go together in the database as well, but I cant put my finger on the point of this being safe or not. I know its being described all over the internet, but no source I found made it more clear to me.p

Negative 978 pWe are currently trying to set up routes in such a way that the returned contenttype can be set using a route parameter. The routing is all working properly now, but there is one problem. If one requests html, then the normal view script is rendered. The data we provide to this script can be anything from a string to a collection of objects, and the view script decides what to show to the user. p  pIf however JSON response is requested, then we just provide the data returned from our controller as JSON. However, some data should not be made publicly available to the user, and hence some filtering is required. Is there any possibility to use JSON view scripts as in ZF1 with contextswitch in order to support such filtering Or maybe another methodp

Negative 978 pIs it possible to generate an xcdatamodel file and then import that file into Xcode I need to create a data model for an iOS app from an existing schema specified by an industry standard. The result will be around two hundred Core Data entities with a gazillion attributes, relationships, etc, etc. Its just plain big. Being an old Unix guy, I would prefer to write some scripts to generate the xcdatamodel file rather than spend two months entering it manually via the Xcode GUI which would, of course, be error prone. The XML in the xcdatamodel file seems very straight forward. Ive looked everywhere and can find no reference of anybody trying this even though it doesnt seem like that big of deal to me. Any comments or suggestionsp
Negative 978 pCurrently Im studying how to find a nearest neighbor using Localitysensitive hashing. However while Im reading papers and searching the web I found two algorithms for doing thisp  p1 Use L number of hash tables with L number of random LSH functions, thus increasing the chance that two documents that are similar to get the same signature. For example if two documents are 80 similar, then theres an 80 chance that they will get the same signature from one LSH function. However if we use multiple LSH functions, then theres a higher chance to get the same signature for the documents from one of the LSH functions. This method is explained in wikipedia and I hope my understanding is correctp  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLocalitysensitivehashingLSHalgorithmfornearestneighborsearch relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLocalitysensitivehashingLSHalgorithmfornearestneighborsearchap  p2 The other algorithm uses a method from a paper section 5 called Similarity Estimation Techniques from Rounding Algorithms by Moses S. Charikar. Its based on using one LSH function to generate the signature and then apply P permutations on it and then sort the list. Actually I dont understand the method very well and I hope if someone could clarify it.p  pMy main question is why would anyone use the second method rather than the first method As I find its easier and faster.p  pI really hope someone can helpp  pEDIT Actually Im not sure if Raff.Edward were mixing between the first and the second. Because only the second method uses a radius and the first just uses a new hash family g composed of the hash family F. Please check the wikipedia link. They just used many g functions to generate different signatures and then for each g function it has a corresponding hash table. In order to find the nearest neighbor of a point you just let the point go through the g functions and check the corresponding hash tables for collisions. Thus how I understood it as more function ... more chance for collisions.p  pI didnt find any mentioning about radius for the first method.p  pFor the second method they generate only one signature for each feature vector and then apply P permutations on them. Now we have P lists of permutations where each contains n signatures. Now they then sort each list from P. After that given a query point q, they generate the signature for it and then apply the P permutations on it and then use binary search on each permuted and sorted P list to find the most similar signature to the query q. I concluded this after reading many papers about it, but I still dont understand why would anyone use such a method because it doesnt seem fast in finding the hamming distance p  pFor me I would simply do the following to find the nearest neighbor for a query point q. Given a list of signatures N, I would generate the signature for the query point q and then scan the list N and compute the hamming distance between each element in N and the signature of q. Thus I would end up with the nearest neighbor for q. And it takes ONp

What happens when I commit those files to the local sever where the files are newerp

Negative 978 pIm trying to make a random number generator that produces many new random numbers very quickly.

Negative 978 pI have the following code  its meant to dynamically construct a list of links to other things based off of a sql query. The record in sql contains a field formed like itemX, itemY, Recipe  Z, where that last element is optional  the code feeds each list element into another sql query, and when it feeds in the last one and gets null it was supposed to just print that piece out. Instead, when I ran it, I kept getting the element prior to the one I want. The problem is fixed by just adding 1 to z, but I want to know why its doing this.p  precode components.htmlltspangtBUILDS FROMltspangt  var componentslist  data[9].split,   for var z  0 z lt componentslist.length z    .getJSONitems.php, itemcomponentslist[z].donefunctioninternald      ifinternald  null        components.appendltbrgtltspangtcomponentslist[z1]ltspangt       else         components.appendltbrgtltspan classcrosslink titleinternald[0]gtinternald[1]  internald[2]ltspangt             codepre  pSo if data[9] is p  pitem3, item4, Recipe  5gp  pitll query those items and spit out p  pItem 3  1g, Item 4  2g, Recipe  5gp  pbut if on the nullcase I just used componentslist[z] it would say p  pItem 3  1g, Item 4  2g, item4p  peven though at that point in the loop z should be 2, not 1.p

Negative 978 pi have a nested list whose fundamental element is data frames, and i want to traverse this list recursively to do some computation of each data frame, finally to get a nested list of results in the same structure as the input. I know rapply is exactly for such kind of task, but i met a problem that, rapply actually goes even deeper than i want, i.e. it decomposes every data frame and applies to each column instead because a data frame itself is a list in R. p  pOne workaround i can think about is to convert each data frame to matrix, but it will force to uniform the data types, so i dont like it really. I want to know if there is any way to control the recursive depth of rapply. Any idea Thanks.p

Negative 978 pIn JAXB output Im trying to populate the xsischemaLocation attribute so it contains complete information for emallem the namespaces and schemas that were used. I am trying to find a better way than hardcoding itp  pWe have a XML schema thats spread across about fifty files.  Each file defines a type and has its own namespace.  Not a smart decision I think, but too late to argue that one.  XJC happily compiles the whole mess and generates classes.  When the output is marshalled all the 50 namespaces are properly put on the root element.p  pThe problem is that Ive been asked to populate the xsischemaLocation attribute with emallem the namespaces and associated schema sources.  So instead of just one namespaceURL pair my.co.schema.v1 a hrefhttpmy.company.comschemasmy.co.schema.v1.xsd relnofollowhttpmy.company.comschemasmy.co.schema.v1.xsda, I will need to put 50 pairs in there.  Sure I can hardcode it but thats wrong.p  pId like to query JAXB about all the sources it used, but that doesnt seem possible. Im starting to think I have to use a Xerces grammar pool and read all the schemas in again.  Is that the best option p  pI added a SCCE below.

Negative 978 pwhat is the recommended approach for polling password changes only in Active Directory, get the updated password and update else where p  pI have looked into classes in System.DirectoryServices.Protocols namespace like DirectoryNotificationControl class but seems like this would poll for any attribute and later on we need to query to see if attribute we are interested password has indeed changed. p  pAlso how do we get password value from active directory  It is possible using LSA although very complex..p

Negative 978 pIve read several answers regarding this but I couldnt find a suitable answer. Ive created a container codedivcode and created 3 individual codedivcodes inside it and have positioned them using CSS positioning. At bottom I have a footer codedivcode but when I load the page in browser, there is extra space below the footer. I dont want to use sticky footer as the contents on my page are loaded dynamically, so the page height changes dynamically.p  pI think the issue is that the browser adds the height of each div while parsing the page and sets that sum as the height of document. As codedivcode is a block level element and their flow is one below the other in normal flow.p  pSo, even when the codedivcodes are positioned using CSSs positioning propertiescodetopcode, codeleftcode, codeetccode, the browser still parses them in their normal flow, thus adding up their height in topbottom manner of their occurences in normal flow and thus resulting in extra space below footer as if the internal codedivcodes codebcode, codeccode, codedcode overflows the footer which they do without positioning.p  pI just want to know how can I instruct my browser to neglect that extra space.p  pHeres my Code see also a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netYpWSM relnofollowlive exampleap  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt          ltstylegt             containerwidth1000pxheight600pxborder2px solid black             bwidth200pxheight500pxborder2px solid blue             cwidth500pxheight500pxborder2px solid greenpositionrelativetop480pxleft247px             dwidth200pxheight500pxborder2px solid redpositionrelativetop1005pxleft797px             footerwidth1000pxheight200pxborder2px solid red         ltstylegt      ltheadgt      ltbodygt          ltdiv idcontainergt              ltdiv idbgtlth2gtDivision01lth2gtltdivgt             ltdiv idcgtlth2gtDivision02lth2gtltdivgt             ltdiv iddgtlth2gtDivision03lth2gtltdivgt          ltdivgt          ltdiv idfootergtlth2gtThis is my FOOTER....lth2gtltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 978 pI was doing some hacking today and found out that stdpriorityqueue does not have a codeclearcode member function. Are there any technical reasons as to why the standards committee may have left this outp  pTo be clear, I am aware that it is easy to work around this via assignmentp  precodeoldPQ  stdpriorityqueueltintgt codepre  pThis solution is less desirable becausep  ol liIt requires you to repeat the type  this does not continue to work under maintenance. As chris pointed out below, you can simplify this if youre using the default constructor, but if you have a custom comparator, this may not be possible.li licodestdpriorityqueuecode cannot be used in a templated function that expects a codeclearcode member function.li liIt is generally undesirable that it does not meet the common interface provided by the other containers. In particular, everything from codestdforwardlistcode to codestdunorderedmapcode to codestdstringcode has codeclearcode. The only other exceptions I note are stdarray, for which the semantics would not make sense, and codestdstackcode and codestdqueuecode, for which the semantics are more questionable when codestddequecode works without any extra effort.li ol  pOne item that looks like an issue, but in practice neednt be Because the internal container used for codestdpriorityqueuecode is templated and may not have a codeclearcode member function of its own, this creates an interesting problem, in particular it raises the question of backward compatibility. This is a nonissue becausep  ol liFor internal containers that do not provide codeclearcode, as long as nobody attempts to invoke codestdpriorityqueueclearcode, the code will continue to compile.li liIt may still be possible with SFINAE to provide the new interface the clear member by calling codeclearcode on the internal container when its available and by repeatedly popping if it is not.li ol  pIt is my opinion that this is a defect in the C standard. Assuming a technical discussion does not provide a strong case for why this method is omitted, I intend to pursue the creation of a standards proposal.p  pEditp  pSeems this is being handled incommittee note the last post a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comaisocpp.orgforumfromgroupssearchinstddiscussionclearstddiscussionmYobAFBOrMty2347w1T4Jhttpsgroups.google.comaisocpp.orgforumfromgroupssearchinstddiscussionclearstddiscussionmYobAFBOrMty2347w1T4Jap  pa hrefhttpwg21.cmeerw.netlwgissue2194httpwg21.cmeerw.netlwgissue2194ap
Negative 978 pUsing c and mssql 2008 R2, I have a service that inserts a user into the system, users have a unique number assigned to them which is something like a1, b1 or c1 which will get increased on user insertion but before insertion I have to check whether there is any previous unique number available or not unique numbers can be deleted on user deletion. For example if there are 5 users in the database, a1,...,a5 are reserved and if you delete lets say 3rd user then a3 will be available for next user insertion. This can be done easily but since I have to read the available unique numbers on every insertion , Im puzzled whether its better to use insert trigger or use application code before insertion p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 978 pIm writing a game using the Slick2D library. I recently added a loading screen using deferred loading. I use the Music class to load OGG files to be used as music.

This way, when I copy a code.warcodefile into my codewebappscodedirectory, it gets deflated automatically by tomcat that works and it should be accessible from my address MYDOMAIN.COMwebservicesMYNEWAPP.p  pHowever, it doesnt work.

Id like to attach it to the model name in order to make each one unique. However, simply doing something like codengmodelselectNumindexcode causes an error when passed through codeattrs.ngModelcode. As is, the ngModel is repeated for each dropdown thats added and thus, every time the form gets overwritten.

Negative 978 pI create student tests in Google Forms. I create an answer key by submitting a form response with all of the right answers and then use an arrayformula to compare student submissions to my submission to get the number of correct responses. I typically create conditional format rule for each column that changes the background of any correct answers in that column green. I would like to automate this by a similar means as the way the array formula works by simply comparing the student submission for that column to the correct submission for that column found in row 2 and then changing the background green. I would love to use a script but I dont know how to start to write one but am will give it a try if someone would like to give some guidance. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 978 pIm programming a game in android where an enemy ship needs to fire in a star pattern around itself. Basically, for any X number of shots I set the enemy ship to fire, I want it to divide 360 degrees around itself by the number of shots and fire the shots off at exactly equilateral angles. So, 3 shots would be fired off with the first shot at 360 degrees, the second shot at 120 degrees and the third shot at 240 degrees. 4 shots would be 360,90,180,270 and so on. Then each shot will travel outwards in a diagonal line until it hits the edge of the screen or something else on the way. So far so good. Here is my code  Im obviously doing something wrong, because although four shots will fire in four equal directions north, south, east and west, 3 shots or 6 shots or 8 shots etc will fire in the wrong directions. The angles just arent correct. Id appreciate any help on this as Ive been struggling with it for quite a while now. In the below example iShotNumber is the number of shots being fired in a salvo. Distance is the distance in pixels the shot will travel in one tick. The shots are added around the circumference of the ship in an array, which is then run through every tick to advance the shots one more step outwards.p  pLogic for drawing the shots around the circumference of the shipp  precodepublic void addShotContext ctx, int iShotNumber, float distance     for int iShot1 iShotltiShotNumber iShot   double          dAngle 0, angle of the shot         dCosFactor0, factor on the xaxis         dSinFactor0 factor on the yaxis          float          fNewX  0, new position on the xaxis         fNewY 0 new position on the yaxis          dAngle  360iShotNumber         dAngle  dAngleiShot          if iShotNumber  1 dAngle180 if theres only one shot then fire straight down          if dAngle360 ampamp dAngle180 if its 360 or 180 then fire straight up or straight down  no need for X                      fNewX  float getShipRadiusMath.cosMath.toRadiansdAngle              if dAnglelt180 fNewXfNewXdistance else fNewXfNewXdistance              fNewXfNewXgetXLocation                   else fNewXgetXLocation                  if dAngle90 ampamp dAngle 270 if its 90 or 270 then fire straight right or straight left  no need for Y                      fNewY  float getShipRadiusMath.sinMath.toRadiansdAngle              if dAnglelt90dAnglegt270 fNewYfNewYdistance else fNewYfNewYdistance              fNewYfNewYgetYLocation                  else fNewYgetYLocation           if dAnglegt90ampampdAnglelt180 dSinFactor  Math.sinMath.toRadiansdAngle90 dCosFactor  Math.cosMath.toRadiansdAngle90         else if dAnglegt181ampampdAnglelt270 dSinFactor  Math.sinMath.toRadiansdAngle180 dCosFactor  Math.cosMath.toRadiansdAngle180         else if dAnglegt271ampampdAnglelt360 dSinFactor  Math.sinMath.toRadiansdAngle270 dCosFactor  Math.cosMath.toRadiansdAngle270         else if dAngle360 dSinFactor  Math.sinMath.toRadiansdAngle271 dCosFactor  Math.cosMath.toRadiansdAngle271         else dSinFactor  Math.sinMath.toRadiansdAngle dCosFactor  Math.cosMath.toRadiansdAngle          dSinFactor  Math.sinMath.toRadiansdAngle dCosFactor  Math.cosMath.toRadiansdAngle          if dSinFactorlt0dSinFactor  dSinFactor1 neutralize negative angles on upshots         if dCosFactorlt0dCosFactor  dCosFactor1 neutralize negative angles on rightshots          if  MainActivity.iDebugLevel gt 1 Log.dEnemyShipaddShot,add shot number  String.valueOfiShot                    with dAngle  String.valueOfdAngle  cosan was  String.valueOfdCosFactor  sinan was  String.valueOfdSinFactor         if  MainActivity.iDebugLevel gt 2 Log.dEnemyShipaddShot,add shot number  String.valueOfiShot   with fNewX  String.valueOffNewX         if  MainActivity.iDebugLevel gt 2 Log.dEnemyShipaddShot,add shot number  String.valueOfiShot   with fNewY  String.valueOffNewY          if dAngle90dAngle270 newShot  new ShotClassctx, fNewX, fNewY, dCosFactor xangle, 0 yangle fire straight to the right or left         else if dAngle360dAngle180 newShot  new ShotClassctx, fNewX, fNewY, 0 xangle, dSinFactor yangle fire straight up or down         else newShot  new ShotClassctx, fNewX, fNewY, dCosFactor xangle, dSinFactor yangle fire at an angle          if  dAngle lt 90  dAngle gt 270              newShot.setShotGoingUptrue                  else                      newShot.setShotGoingUpfalse                   if  dAngle lt 180               newShot.setShotGoingRighttrue                  else                      newShot.setShotGoingRightfalse                   if  MainActivity.iDebugLevel gt 1 Log.dEnemyShipaddShot,add shot number  String.valueOfiShot   with goingup  String.valueOfnewShot.getShotGoingUp  with goingright  String.valueOfnewShot.getShotGoingRight          arShots.addnewShot         if  MainActivity.iDebugLevel gt 2 Log.dEnemyShipaddShot,add shot number  String.valueOfiShot   with position  String.valueOfgetXLocation   String.valueOfgetYLocation  firing params  String.valueOfdCosFactor   String.valueOfdSinFactor  angle was  String.valueOfdAngle      codepre  pLogic for sending the shots out in a diagonal linep  precode        inpDistance  inpDistance  .2f slow down the shot to one fifth speed          for int iShotInTheSequence1iShotInTheSequenceltinpNumberShotsiShotInTheSequence               fFactor  float inpDistance  getYFiringAngle             if  getShotGoingUp   shot is going up                  fYLocation  fYLocation  fFactor              shot is going up             else shot is going down                  fYLocation  fYLocation  fFactor               shot is going down              fFactor  float inpDistance  getXFiringAngle             if  getShotGoingRight   shot is going right                 fXLocation  fXLocation  fFactor              shot is going right             else shot is going left                 fXLocation  fXLocation  fFactor              shot is going left            codepre

Negative 978 pI am trying to make a little program that will ask the user if theyre human and then do a bunch of other stuff afterwards. The following is a snippet of the code where the user is asked whether theyre human. Now if you enter anything other than yes or no, the program then loops with the goto statement. The problem that Im having is that the if statements, when they end go to this goto statement thus looping when the program should end. How can I get the goto statement to be exclusively part of the second else if statement Failing that, is there another loop structure that I should use Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltwindows.hgt include ltstringgt using namespace std  int main       go     string i      cout ltlt Are you Humangtltltendl     cin gtgt i      if i  yesampampYes         coutltlt Coolltltendl      else if i  noampampNo         coutltlt Interestingltltendl      else if i yesampampYesampampnoampampNo         coutltlt A simple Yes or No will suffice...ltltendl         goto go      systempause     return 0  codepre

Negative 978 pIm writing a multiuser application in which requests for a given resource say, codepeople4code will return differing levels of detail depending on the user performing the request for example, user 4 or a support representative would see the entire resource, while other users would not see certain fields such as the users email address.p  pSpring HATEOAS has thorough support for building links, but the main codeResourceAssembercode interface only provides a single adapter method that takes a domain object and returns a resource object, with no provision for additional parameters such as the current Spring Security user, and neither codeResourceSupportcode nor codeResourceltTgtcode provides facilities for filtering the fields returned.p  pThe approach Im currently leaning toward is having the implementation of codetoResourcecode for codeResourceAssemblerltCustomer, CustomerResourcegtcode manually dig out the current Spring Security credentials and apply filtering at that point, essentially handwriting a multistage copy constructor that will add public fields, then forfriends fields, then private fields to the resource object.p  pIs there a more integrated, especially declarative, way to handle the task, or is this the best solution available now Will this approach integrate with the Spring Data REST controller, or will I have to reimplement paging and so forth if I want to handle the assembly myselfp
Negative 978 pI have an existing codebase of unit tests where the same classes are defined for each test, and a program that iterates over them. Something like thisp  precodetestfiles.each do tf      load teststftf   test     Kernel.constgetmyclass   TestUnitUIConsoleTestRunner.run test  codepre  pWhile working on these tests, Ive realized that ruby allows you to coderequirecode classes with the same name from different files, and it merges the methods of the two. This leads to problems as soon as the class hierarchy is not the same codesuperclass mismatch for class ...codep  pUnfortunately, simply a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions3424663unloadarubyclassunloading the classa is not enough, as there are many other classes in the hierarchy that remain loaded.p  pIs there a way to execute each test in a different global namespacep  pWhile I figure that using modules would be the way to go, Im not thrilled with idea of changing the hundreds of existing files by hand.p  pEDITp  pFollowing Cary Swovelands suggestion, Ive moved the test running code to a separate code.rbcode file and am running it using backticks.

Negative 978 pThe example of CameraToMpegTest.java in bigflake.com, or Show  capture camera in Grafika, uses the camera.preview to get the frame data. Experiments show that Nexus 4, Android 4.4.2 the frame rate is 10 fps. This is not as high as expected.p  pIf we use the same device Nexus 4, Android 4.4.2 to record a video using the camera, the frame rate is 30fps.p  pSo I assume the lower frame rate using camera.preview lies in the method preview method. I once read a post, saying that camera preview method has a lower frame rate.p  pSo it seems the workaround is to use raw frame data from the camera hardware directly.

The problem came when I ran a memory analysis and found that I was getting tons of addressing errors and alleged memory leaks. p  pSo, to start the debugging process I wanted to come here and ask why this worked and if its valid C syntax. I was under the impression thatp  precodetemp[0] codepre  pWould dereference to codecharcode, codeacode. It would then take a further dereference of codeacode to access its members. Further, I was under the impression thatp  precodetemp[row][col] codepre  pIs translated top  precodetemp  rowcol  col codepre  pat run time. As such, the double dereference of codetemp[0][i]code should give an offset from codetempcode and not access codeacode at all.p  hr  pWhats more interesting is that thisp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid      char a  mallocsizeofchar5     char b  mallocsizeofchar5     char temp[]  a, b     int i, h, k  a, j  A       fori  0 i lt 5 i         a[i]  k         b[i]  j           fori  0 i lt 5 i         forh  0 h lt 5 h             printfc , temp[i][h]         puts            freea     freeb     return 0      codepre  pDoes not compile when run at a hrefhttpideone.comvmC34k relnofollow titleIdeOneIdeOnea.

I know that image intensive applications tend to use a lot of RAM and my plan is to limit it to only one image per time so once the user clicks on some other bus line, the others are closed and their imageviews are set back to null, but what is wondering me, can empty ImageViews cause RAM to be around 20MBs My images are 320px in width and ranging from 200 to 1500px in height I know, its a lot, but I have set them to grayscale and compressed them Size of the images is from 50kb up to 150kb.p  pMy applications APK is 710kb in size, app when installed is around 3MB and with data it totals to 7.5MB.p  pstrongSo, to clarify, my questions arestrongp  p1 Can empty ImageViews cause high RAM usage as wellp  p2 If yes, should I dynamically create an ImageView and populate it once the user clicks on the button, instead of the current approach when they are all created at startupp  p3 Can multidimensional variables mostly strings, 6 strings with 35 dimensions cause high RAM usage as well Most of them are around 10 characters long.p  p4 Are there any tools which I could use on Android Studio which could help me to locate possible memory leaksp  p5 Do nonglobal variables get automatically destroyed once the ie. function has returned a value or do I need to manually set them to null after Im done with themp  p6 What are generally some good practices to reduce RAM usage on Android when developing an appp  pSorry for not being very technical here, Im not a professional programmer or anything, this is more of a hobby of mine and Im trying to learn a bit more here.

Negative 978 pI am taking the cs50 course on edx and am doing the hacker edition of pset3 in essence it is the advanced version. Basically the program takes a value to be searched for as the commandline argument, and then asks for a bunch of numbers to be used in an array.  Then it sorts and searches that array for the value entered at the commandline. The way the program is implemented, it uses a pseudorandom number generator to feed the numbers for the array.p  pThe task is to write the search and sorting functions. I already have the searching function, but the sorting function is supposed to be On. In the regular version you were supposed to use a On  2 algorithm which wasnt a problem to implement. Also using a log n algorithm wouldnt be an issue either.  But the problem set specifically asks for a big On algorithm.p  pIt gives a hint in saying that, since no number in the array is going to be negative, and the not greater than LIMIT the numbers output by the generator are modulod so they are not greater than 65000. But how does that help in getting the algorithm to be Onp  pBut the counting sort algorithm, which purports to be an acceptable solution, returns a new sorted array rather than actually sort the original one, and that contradicts with the pset specification that reads As this return type of void implies, this function must not return a sorted array it must instead destructively sort the actual array that its passed by moving around the values therein.p  pAlso, if we decide to copy the sorted array onto the original one using another loop, with so many consecutive loops, Im not sure if the sorting function can be considered to have a running time of On anymore. Here is the actual a hrefhttpd2o9nyf4hwsci4.cloudfront.net2014xpsets3hacker3hacker3.html relnofollowpseta, the question is about the sorting part.p  pAny ideas to how to implement such an algorithm would be greatly appreciated. Its not necessary to provide actual code, rather just the logic of you can create a On algorithm under the conditions provided.p

This is causing issues, of course, but I cant tell what Im doing wrong.p  pIm new to OpenAL, so Ive been looking at a couple guides a hrefhttpohno789.blogspot.com201308openalonios.html relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpsgithub.comsoftwaremariodianaAudioBufferPlayerwikiReplacingCfunctionsdeprecatediniOS7 relnofollowherea to see what I need to do.  If I download their sample projects and test em, they both work fine.  If I copy their files into my project, and ignore the files I made, they still work fine.  Im assuming something got lost in translation when I started rebuilding the code for use in my project.  Asking around and searching online hasnt given me any leads though, so Im hoping someone here could put me on the right track.p  pHeres the actual setup code Im using in my AudioPlayer.mp  precode voidsetup      audioSampleBuffers  [NSMutableDictionary new]     audioSampleSources  [NSMutableArray new]       [self setupAudioSession]     [self setupAudioDevice]     [self setupNotifications]    BOOLsetupAudioSession        This has been depricated.

Negative 978 pFor a team of developers it is essential that everybody sets up and configures the application server. In our case we are using websphere 8.5.p  pIm looking for an easy way to do this. Normally you do it using the profile management tool located in WASHOMEbinProfileManagement and this tool works quiet well. But after the installation of the websphere server one still needs to configure the server profile  creating datasources, JMS queues, buses, variables and so on. So I thought it would be nice if there is a way to apply these configurations to an existing profile.p  pMy first try was to just configure one profile and then make a configuration backup usingp  precode WASHOMEbinbackupConfig.bat codepre  pBut the configuration contains e.g. the hostname and other host dependent configurations. So the backupConfig.bat tool is not what Im looking for.p  pThe next thought that came in my mind is that I might could create a special profileTemplate. So that others can use the profile management tool and use this template. But the template structure does not seem to be made for customization. A lot of files and nearly no documentation can be found of how to create an own profile template.p  pSo I came across the augment templates. These template are used as the name implies to add specific configuration to an existing profile. I found a lot of documentation of how to apply an augmentation to an existing profile but no documentation of how to create an augmentation.p  pAt last I think that there must be some way of exporting websphere datasource, buses, jms etc. configuration and apply them to other profiles, because in very big installations the operations team must have this ability.p  pI know that I can add containerspecific descriptors to the EAR. E.g. codeMETAINFibmconfigcellsdefaultCellapplicationsdefaultAppresources.xmlcode. But I dont want to build environment specific EAR files, because it couples our builds to the infrastructure and thus we have to build and redeploy when ever operations changes the infrastructure, e.g. hostnames, IPs, passwords.p  pDoes anyone know how to manage the distribution of datasource, buses, jms, etc. to multiple websphere installationsp

Negative 978 pIm working on some fish electroshocking data and looking at fish species abundance per transects in a river.  Essentially, I have an abundance of different species per transect that Im plotting in a stacked bar chart.  But, what I would like to do is label the top of the bar, or underneath the xaxis tick mark with N  Total Preds for that particular transect.  The abundance being plotted is the number of that particular species divided by the total number of fish preds that were caught at that transect.  I am having trouble figuring out a way to do this since I dont want to label the plot with the actual yvalue that is being plotted.p  pExcuse the crude code.  I am newer to R and not super familiar with generating random datasets.  The following is what I came up with.  Obviously in my real data the abundance  per transect always adds up to 100 , but the idea is to be able to label the graph with TotalPreds for a transect.p  precoderandom data Transectltc120 HabitatltcSand,Gravel SpeciesltcSmallmouth,Darter,Rock Bass,Chub Abundltrunif20,0.0,100.0 TotalPredsltsample1139,20,replaceTRUE dataltdata.frameTransect,Habitat,Species,Abund,TotalPreds  Generate plot AbundChartltggplotdatadata,aesxTransect,yAbund,fillSpecies AbundChartlabstitleShocking Fish Abundancethemebw scaleycontinuousRelative Abundance ,expandc0.02,0,   breaksseq0,100,by20,labelsseq0,100,by20 scalexdiscreteTransect,expandc0.03,0 themeplot.titleelementtextfacebold,vjust2,size25 themelegend.titleelementtextvjust5,size15 geombarstatidentity,colourblack facetgridHabitat,labellerlabelboth,scalesfreex codepre  pI get this plot that I would like to label with TotalPreds as described previously.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZwinf.png altenter image description herep  pAgain my plot would have bars that reached 100 for abundance, and in my real data transects 110 are gravel and 1120 are sand.  Excuse my poor sample dataset.p  pUpdatep  pMy actual data looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDE9w1.png altactual data imagep  pVariable in this case is the fish species and value is the abundance of that species at that particular electroshocking transect. TotalPreds is repeated when the data moves to a new species, because total preds is indicative of the total preds caught at that particular transect i.e. each transect only has 1 total preds value. Maybe the melt function wasnt the right way to analyze this, but I have like 17 fish species that were caught at different rates across these 20 transects. I guess habitat type is singular to a transect as well, with 110 being gravel and 1120 being sand, and that is repeated in my dataset across fish species as well.p

Negative 978 pMatch rules for svnallfastexport must end with a trailing , except for recurse rules.  I have an svn repository that needs to recurse on a branch and do different things with directories and files under the branch.  Subdirectories should get placed in one git branch and files directly under the svn branch should be placed in a different git branch.  For example, in svnp  precodebranches20subdir1 branches20subdir2 branches20file1 branches20file2 codepre  psubir1 and subdir2 should go to branch A in git and file1 and file2 should go to branch B in git.p  pBecause of the way svn exports its date, only branches20 gets mentioned as changed for the commit that created it so I must have svnallfastexport match branches20 and recurse to see the files and subdirectories.p  pBecause svnallfastexport requires a trailing slash on a match pattern, how can I match file names in this situation  I can match the subdirs just fine but currently svnallfastexport ignores the files because it cant recurse on a file and I dont know how to write a rule to match an ordinary file.p

Negative 978 pI am using JAXB to create classes from an xsd schema.  strongIs there a way to tag individual complexTypes so that they are sent to different destination packages rather than have them all sent to the same packagestrong  p  pThe reason I need this is that a lot of the resulting java classes will be replaced with other classes of the same names from a different source.  It is a pain to manually remove all the unused classes from one destination folder.  It would be easier to just put all the unwanted classes in a different folder, which I could then ignore when I import the output into eclipse.  When I tried to simply exclude the complexType definitions from the unwanted classes from the xsd file, xjc threw errors each time it encountered a property of one of the unwanted types.  I need to keep the property references, but I want the eventual java references to those properties to point to classes of the same name that have already been generated by other means.  p  pHere is my build.xml method for compiling the classes.

Negative 978 pIve got a server that uses a two thread system to manage between 100 and 200 concurrent connections. It uses TCP sockets, as packet delivery guarantee is important its a communication system where missed remote API calls could FUBAR a client.p  pIve implemented a custom protocol layer to separate incoming bytes into packets and dispatch them properly the library is included below. I realize the issues of using MSGPEEK, but to my knowledge, it is the only system that will fulfill the needs of the library implementation. I am open to suggestions, especially if it could be part of the problem.p  pBasically, the problem is that, randomly, the server will drop the clients socket due to a lack of incoming packets for more than 20 seconds, despite the client successfully sending a keepalive packet every 4. I can verify that the server itself didnt go offline and that the connection of the users including myself experiencing the problem is stable.p  pThe library for sendingreceiving is herep  precodeshort ncsocketsendwstring command, wstring data  wstringstream ss int datalen  intcommand.length  2  intdata.length  2  12 ss ltlt zeropadintdatalen ltlt L ltlt command ltlt L ltlt data          int tosend  datalen short rc  0 do     int res  sendthisgtsock, const charss.str.cstr, datalen, NULL     if res  SOCKETERROR         tosend  res     else         return FALSE     rc     Sleep10  while tosend  0 ampamp rc lt 10  if tosend  0     return TRUE return FALSE   short ncsocketrecvnetcommandamp nc  vectorltwchartgt bufferBUFFERSIZE int recvd  recvthisgtsock, charbuffer.data, BUFFERSIZE, MSGPEEK if recvd gt 0      if recvd gt 8          wchart lenstr  new wchart[4]         memcpylenstr, buffer.data, 8         int fulllen  wtoilenstr         delete lenstr          if fulllen gt 0              if recvd gt fulllen                  buffer.resizefulllen  2                 recvd  recvthisgtsock, charbuffer.data, fulllen, NULL                 if recvd gt fulllen                      buffer.resizebuffer.size  2                     buffer.pushbackcharL0                     vectorltwstringgt data  parsewstringL, buffer.data, 2                     if data.size  3                          nc.command  data[1]                         nc.payload  data[2]                         return TRUE                                          else                         return FALSE                                  else                     return FALSE                          else                 return FALSE                  else              recvthisgtsock, charbuffer.data, BUFFERSIZE, NULL             return FALSE                   else         return FALSE  else     return FALSE codepre  pp  pThis is the code for determining if too much time has passedp  precodeif intdifftimetime0, regusrs[i].lastrecvd gt SERVERTIMEOUT                  regusrs[i].sock.end                 regusrs[i].isvalid  FALSE                 sendtoallLremoveuser, regusrs[i].serveruserid                  wstringstream logentry                 logentry ltlt regusrs[i].firstname ltlt L  ltlt regusrs[i].lastname ltlt L suid ltlt regusrs[i].serveruserid ltlt L,p ltlt regusrs[i].parent ltlt L,pid ltlt regusrs[i].parentid ltlt L was disconnected due to idle                 writetologfileserverlog, logentry.str              codepre  pThe regusrs[i] is using the currently iterated member of a vector I use to story socket descriptors and user information.

Negative 978 pI have a string array of information that I need to pass from one user control to the other. The application settings contains a codeSystem.Collection.Specialized.StringCollectioncode datatype for such cases. But since I need to use my array in a specific order, does a string collection help Apart from that is it even a good idea to save such parameters in the application settings or is there a better way of passing these arguments around the program I have used codeEventListenerscode in the program as well but passing arguments from one user control to the other seems less convenient with them.p

Negative 978 h2The situationh2  pFor example purpose, the following situation can be consideredp  ul liFeature A is a big one, multiple days of work. At this time, its not yet coded but nearly so. Should be released for testing as soon as done. Considering the size of the feature, development is likely to stretch for some more time after that with some back and forth between development and testing.li ul  pEverything below has happened since the beginning of Feature Ap  ul liFix B came up during , coded quickly, but testing takes a long time depends on another busy team, not yet finished, not ready for production.li liFeature C is introduced. Quickly coded but results uncertain may require multiple commits through time to reach the final version. Testing of current state in progress. Results may lead to code adjustements. Meant for production at a specific date in a few months, not before. li liFix D, quickly coded, is in testing and is very likely to be ready for production before Fix B and Feature C.li liFix E is more involved, might take a few days. Multiple commits are expected. Should be testable along the way. Its unclear when this will be ready for production.li ul  pWe might end up having to put Fix D in production, then Feature C, then Fix B... but maybe its going to be Fix D, then Fix B, then Fix E, then Feature C. And who knows, maybe Feature A will go smoother than expected and will have to be released before some of the other bits.p  pHow would one deal with this many parallel developments in SVN and when deploying Id interested in what one would commit in which branches, what might end up in the trunk, and deployment steps when any of these is ready for production, knowing that in our environment we do not really featurefreeze anything and any fix or feature, if ready, is likely to be pushed to production Im not sure this is great either  if you think this is the root of our deployment issues, do tell.p  hr  h2The context and current solutionh2  pOur team uses three environments development, test and production. We use a SVN repository for the  web application with the usual structure trunk, branches, tags.p  pOur current method goes like thisp  ul liDevelop on trunk unless its a big new feature. This includes quick bug fixes, quick changes and things that are invisible to users updates to devonly features.li liIf its a big feature multiple days of work or very risky change, create a new branch and commit there until ready. Switch working copy back and forth between the branch and trunk as needed.li liWhen quick changes are ready for testing, we simply svnupdate the working copy on the test environment it points to trunk.li liWhen a big feature is ready for testing, we usually switch the test working copy to the branch temporarily. This doesnt work well when two branches are to be tested at the same time.li liWhen things are tested and ready for production, the method has varied... ul liProduction points to trunk and is simply svnupdatedli liProduction is switched to a release tagli liProduction points to a production branch where trunk updates are merged with cherrypickingli ulli ul  pWhile this has worked for a while, the current situation makes it rather unmanageable. There are at least 3 different fixes that were committed to trunk but need to be tested before going to production. Since development and test working copies point at trunk, all the fixes are available for testing no problem there. There are also 2 branches that need testing before going to production. With the current method, they would need to be merged into trunk which is problematic if they turn out not to be ready.p  pA frequent situation is that bug fix A is ready for testing before bug fix B and committed in that order in trunk but bug fix B ends up tested first client priority and needs to go to production right away.p  pOh and we dont have test suites on this application because its a huge legacy codebase and there is not time alloted to creating tests. As such, committing to trunk when its done is mostly based on gut feeling.p

Negative 978 pI am stuck with a design decision of how to share variables across modules in nodejs.p  pI have a main.js module which uses socket.io to receives messages from 2 types of socket io client groups , say FOO and BAR. This module basically acts as a middleware receives message from FOO, apply some transformation and forwards it to BAR and vice versa.p  pI wanted to write couple of separate scripts helper.js which would implement some of the transformation logic and hence modularize my middleware. My plan was to require these scripts in main.js. However, main.js would have some variables which needs to be shared with helper.js. I need a mechanism for both main.js and helper.js to know when these variables are modified by either of them.p  pThere were 2 ways I thought could do itp  ol liUse global for these variablesli liUse EventEmitter and notify all scripts when there is a change. Sample code belowli ol  pHowever I am not sure which way to proceed or if there is a better way to do this.

PrintDocumentA is to be printed in landscape mode, while PrintDocumentB is to be printed in portrait mode. Both of them share the same PrintDialog  for design issues, it has to be this way.p  pThe code I use to call them for printing is as followsp  precodeIf PrintDialog1.ShowDialog  Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK Then         PrintDocumentA.PrinterSettings  PrintDialog1.PrinterSettings         PrintDocumentA.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape  True         PrintDocumentA.Print          PrintDocumentB.PrinterSettings  PrintDialog1.PrinterSettings         PrintDocumentB.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape  False         PrintDocumentB.Print End If codepre  pBut the odd thing is, even though Ive disabled it, PrintDocumentB still comes out in landscape.p  pNow of course I could place PrintDocumentB before PrintDocumentA in the code, like sop  precodeIf PrintDialog1.ShowDialog  Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK Then         PrintDocumentB.PrinterSettings  PrintDialog1.PrinterSettings         PrintDocumentB.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape  False         PrintDocumentB.Print          PrintDocumentA.PrinterSettings  PrintDialog1.PrinterSettings         PrintDocumentA.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape  True         PrintDocumentA.Print End If codepre  pAnd this would work  for the first printout.

Negative 978 pI have an AngularJS frontend that sends requests to a Rails API backend application. The AngularJS frontend is running in a NGINX server. The Rails API is running in an Unicorn server.p  pGenerally, they are working fine together, but in one case. When I first load the home page most of the times but not always there is a big delay around 12 seconds to process the request to Rails. Im not sure, but my guess is this is only happening for the first request from Nginx to Unicorn.p  pThis is a big issue for me, because when a user request the home page for first time, the page is loaded and displayed quite fast it takes around 2 secs to display all components, however, the user has to wait around these 12 seconds, until the combo boxes are loaded with data coming from the backend.p  pI have no idea about server configuration. Im just a developer. I tried to debug the request and try to figure out where the bottleneck is, but I dont find anything.p  pPlease, find my NGINX access.log logsp  precode127.0.0.1   [12Nov2014193345 0100] GET  HTTP1.1

It displays more or less same info that the Nginx access.log. But this time, you can see the requests to Rails API i.e. getTranslationLanguages that has a latency of 12.40 secs.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Hw1I.jpg altDelay in Unicorn server requestp  pWhy is it waiting for that 12 seconds Could be any cache What else can I checkp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I dont know why it seems to be related to cache or cookies. When I delete browsing history with cache and cookies in my browser and I load the site the issue doesnt happen anymore. After that, if I just refresh the page, the issue happens.p  pstrongIMPORTANT UPDATEstrong Now, Im pretty sure the issue is located in Unicorn. If I just shutdown Unicorn and startup webrick without any other update on my application or code the issue doenst happen anymore.p  pI attach my Unicorn.rb config filep  precode configunicorn.rb if ENV[RAILSENV]  development   workerprocesses 1   stderrpath UsersRoberProjectsyanpydevyanpyapilogunicorn.stderr.log   stdoutpath UsersRoberProjectsyanpydevyanpyapilogunicorn.stdout.log elsif ENV[RAILSENV]  test   workerprocesses 1   stderrpath homeubuntuenvtestwwwyanpyapitestlogunicorn.stderr.log   stdoutpath homeubuntuenvtestwwwyanpyapitestlogunicorn.stdout.log   listen 8081 else   workerprocesses 3   workerprocesses 1   stderrpath homeubuntuenvproductionwwwyanpyapilogunicorn.stderr.log   stdoutpath homeubuntuenvproductionwwwyanpyapilogunicorn.stdout.log end  timeout 30 codepre  pNote You dont have to worry about the environment, the issue is happening in both of them.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong When I send request in my browser directly to a Rails endpoint in Unicorn i.e codehttplocalhost8080getTranslationLanguagescode I got the result immediately in my browser in json format. I mean, the issue doesnt happen. So, it looks like the issue is only when the request are sent from Nginx to Unicorn.p  pstrongIMPORTANT UPDATEstrong I have confirmed the issue is only happening with Google Chrome. It never happens with Safari. Even, I have noticed, when I run audit tool in Google tools, it somehow clean everything, so everytime I run the audit it works perfectly.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have installed and tested with Puma. Its working. I dont know why the combination of Unicorn and Chrome is not working.p

Negative 978 pIm currently facing an algorithmic problem were I could need some hints from you.p  pHere the problems details Given are n numbers of FIFOs with a capacity of k. There are also sixteen different elements. Now we fill those FIFOs with a random amount of different  random elements. The task is to remove a given random amount of random elements from the FIFOs. It is possible that there is no optimal solution caused by other blocking elements rotating the FIFO isnt allowed. The best solution is the one which removes all or most elements so there are more possible solutions.p  pWell here is an visualized example of three FIFOs seperated by   and three elements a, b and cp  precode   1  2  3           .  b  c          lt last elements     .  b  a      a  a  b          lt first elements codepre  pI hope you now know what problem Im facing. please feel free to ask if there is anything unintelligiblep  pHere is my idea of an algorithmp  ul liTreat each FIFO seperately and check on how much elements possibly could get removed.

I would like to extend the application class in which main is implemented to allow an actionPerformed method to be implemented in it not within main of course to listen to the press of one of two buttons within the UI class, creating a new instance of the Purchase class on the event, that will in turn pass a this reference to the single UI class instances button.addActionListener method.  p  precodeimport javax.swing. import java.awt. import java.awt.event.   public class CreatePurchase implements ActionListener   boolean isInterface  true CreatePurchase testing  new CreatePurchase SupportiveJFrame uiFrame  new SupportiveJFrame testing, Southwest Invoice Systems, isInterface     Purchase firstPurchase  new Purchase uiFrame, true    public static void main String args[]         public void actionPerformed ActionEvent e       Object source  e.getSource      if source  uiFrame.newInvoice          New object created here                     codepre  pMy question is, How can a reference to the application class be passed to the UI constructor thereby allowing it to be passed to the JButton newObject  Were I to place the initializations of uiFrame and firstPurchase in main, firstPurchase would be out of scope from actionPerformed ActionEvent e .  p

Negative 978 pI am currently trying to find the best methodology to integrate the cryptographic acceleration unit present on my MCU to take advantage of the performance gain not only in my custom apps but also in the external SSLTLS library I will need to use.p  pMy platform runs a Freescale Kinetis ARM CortexM4 device with a uCLinux distribution. I have currently managed to run mbedTLS Polar SSL in user space. I also have the possibility to run CyASSL from WolfSSL. I am now looking at the best strategy to run the memory mapped Crytographic Acceleration Unit MMCAU peripheral on the processor together with my application. The code itself shall not be too difficult to integrate since Freescale provides a library with C wrappings around assembly optimized code. The tricky point being the middleware enabling the use of the crypto unit in the user apps and the libraries.p  pOne possibility is to rewrite the linux cryptographic kernel module cryptodev in order to make use of the MMCAU in my user apps this would have the benefit to access the MMCAU from several user apps while my platform does not support shared libraries. However I am not sure this is the best strategy. In addition, mbedTLS does not seem to provide support for the native linux cryptographic driver.p  pOther alternatives are proposed here a hrefhttpcryptodevlinux.org relnofollowhttpcryptodevlinux.orga but, since I am not a true linux specialist, I am not really sure what would be the best solution in my case.p  pA piece of advice on the best strategy to adopt here to get the most flexible solution while still benefitting from the improved performance of the hardware crypto would be welcome.p

Negative 978 pIm having a big problem with androidintellijgradle that Im hoping someone can help me with. I have an external library that I wrote and I have it imported into an android project. The external library was first compiled with java 1.8 and I got a codeunexpected top level exception bad class file magic version 0034.0000code error. After reading through various Stackoverflow questions like [this][1], and getting no where with the problem, I realized that the external library had to be compiled using JDK 1.7 which I then did.  brNow this initial error, I believe, was based on an exception that I wrote that one of my classes throws. For some reason the unexpected top level exception was pointing to a an error parsing my exception class which extends Exception. This isnt anything big, its simply, p  precodepublic class MyException extends Exception public MyExceptionString msgsupermsg codepre  pAfter compiling with 1.7, I no longer receive the error. How ever I am now getting a verify error and it seems to only be getting called when I instantiate a class that throws an exception. I have a simple java bean in the external library with getters and setters, and an enum and both work in the android app without issue. p I also tried to store the jar file in the libs directory to see if that would solve the problem, but I get nothing. p Is there some sort of issue with android and custom exceptions p Edit I tried copying the class files into the android project and the original issue goes away. The only new thing that arises is that I get a an error from Jackson codeDidnt find class org.joda.convert.ToString on pathcode. I could probably fix this and use a different JSON library, but I would like to avoid using the class files in this project directly and would prefer to use it as an external jarp

Negative 978 pFrameworks often need to contain classes that have public methods because of the needs of the framework users using the framework arent really supposed to invoke them.p  pFor example, a Class might have a public constructor so a factory in another package can instantiate it, but the user is always supposed to use the factory, never the constructor directly.p  pId like JavaDoc to only emit documentation on those methods that a user is supposed to invoke, not others. So in the example, it should document the factory method, but not the public constructor.p  pOf course, JavaDoc itself wont know which is which, so I was thinking the public methods could be annotated with some Annotation, like SupportedAPI, and JavaDoc would only spit out documentation on those. This would have the added benefit to mark clearly which methods are expected to remain stable.p  pCan JavaDoc be configured to do thatp

The thing is that when I reduce the screen width sometimes there is extra space after the last image not equal amount of images on each row which misguides the user that other images should be there Is there a way to remove the extra space because it assumes its the last page until they scroll down and the the next button.

Negative 978 pSo Ive just implemented my first usercontrol. It holds a ComboBox that I want to populate with checkboxes. It is going to sit repeatedly in the headers of a datagrid. p  pThe ItemsSource of the combobox is exposed via a DependencyProperty in my usercontrol. When I declare this DependecyProperty I also pass a callback because I want to prepare the collection before it gets passed to the combobox. This is done in the callback.  p  pEverything works fine and the bindings seem to work, except that they do not get updated when the underlying collection changes. My underlying collection is an ObservableCollection and my callback only gets called when the collection is declared eventhough I have propertychanged call for the property right after I added my items.p  pThis is my code for the usercontrolp  precodepublic static readonly DependencyProperty ItemsSourceProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterItemsSource,typeofObservableCollectionltRoomViewModelgt,typeofDataGridFilterControl,new PropertyMetadatanew PropertyChangedCallbackItemsSourceChangedCallBack      static private  void ItemsSourceChangedCallBackDependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e              DataGridFilterControl originator  d as DataGridFilterControl         if originator  null                      originator.PopulateCheckBoxes                      public ObservableCollectionltRoomViewModelgt ItemsSource              get                      return ObservableCollectionltRoomViewModelgtGetValueItemsSourceProperty                  set                       SetValueItemsSourceProperty,value               codepre  pAnd the xaml for the ComboBoxp  precodeltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding PathCheckBoxView gt codepre  pAs you can see the ItemsSource for the ComboBox is different from the DependecyProperty.

Negative 978 pIm working on bringing some old code forward to the CBuilder XE7 environment. When I compile a small standalone tool with the lowlevel io library, I get this errorp  precode[ilink32 Error] Error Unresolved external stdchartraitsltchargtassignchar , unsigned int, char referenced from ltlibrarygtmydate codepre  pThe mydate class isnt horribly complex, and only one function really uses an STL class, string surprise. If I commented out the contents of one function, the error went away. That code is pasted below, but before you look at it, a few things to notep  ol lipThis code was written a VERY long time ago. I inherited it in the C Builder 6 development environment. I brought it forward to C Builder 2010 a few years ago, where it seemed to work just fine.pli lipPart of the reason it does things the way it does is that this code is also compiled for a nonVCL environment. Everything is standardized on char  because it was portable.pli lipMy first guess was that this was a widenarrow string issue. I think it should all be narrow strings, but I wasnt able to make everything explicitly narrow in a manner that the compiler liked. pli lipIn this case, I found a way to work around the issue by letting TDateTime do the formatting for me, but there are other cases in the much larger application where string is used instead of AnsiString, either because the author was using other STL classes map, etc, or he was using it to host a character array that he was wandering through with a pointer generally doing manual tokenizing similar to the example below.pli lipI do not have the luxury of bringing all of this code up to 21st century C standards. Im sure therere better ways of doing many of these things, but I do not have enough time available to rewriteupdate the millions of lines of code in this product suite. My goal here is to understand why this code now causes a problem, and how to fix it with as little change as possible.pli lipAs far as I can tell this method isnt even called by the application.pli lipThe class name has been changed to protect the guilty.pli ol  pSo, here it is.

Negative 978 pI found a macro and have been using it to import datasets that are given to me in csv format. Now I need to edit it because I have datasets that have an id number in them and I want sas datasets with the same name.p  pTHE csvs are named things like IDSTUDY233first.csv So I want the sas dataset to be IDSTUDY233first. It should appear in my work folder.p  pI thought it would just create a sas dataset for each csv named IDSTUDY233first or something like that. and so on and so forth for each additional study. However its naming this way. IDSTUDYFIRST and over rights itself for every ID. I am newer to macros and have been trying to figure out WHY it does this and how to fix it. Suggestionsp  precodelet subdirYfilepath MACRO VARIABLE FOR FILEPATH filename dir  ampsubdir..csv  give the file the name from the path that your at whatever the csv is named data new create the dataset new it has all those filepath names  csv names length filename  fname  200 infile dir  eoflast filenamefname input  last filenamefname run  proc sort datanew nodupkey sort but dont keep duplicate files by filename run  data null  create the dataset null set new call symputxcatsfilename,n,filename call the file name for this observation n call symputxcatsdsn,n,compressscanfilename,2,., ,ka call the dataset for this file compress then read the file call symputxnobs,n call for the number of observations run put ampnobs. but each observation in  macro import start the macro import do i1 to ampnobs  Do for each fie to number of observations  proc import datafileampampfilenameampi outampampdsnampi dbmscsv replace                                               getnamesyes                                           run  end  mend import import codepre  pcall import macrop  pAs  you can see I added my comments of my understanding. Like I said macros are new to me. I may be incorrect in my understanding. I am guessing the problem is either in p  precode    call symputxcatsdsn,n,compressscanfilename,2,., ,ka codepre  por it is in the import statement probably outampampdsnampi since it rapidly over writes the previous SAS files until it does every one. Its just I need all the sas files not just the last 1.p

But none of the solutions helped.p  pHeres my httpd.conf filep  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot Usersprakash2282Desktopapache    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultlogs    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAlias cgibin Usersprakash2282Desktopapachecgibin  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule cgidmodulegt           ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX      socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.          Scriptsock cgisock ltIfModulegt    Usersprakash2282Desktopapachecgibin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased  CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.  ltDirectory Usersprakash2282Desktopapachecgibingt     AllowOverride None     Options None     Require all granted ltDirectorygt  ltIfModule mimemodulegt           TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from      filename extension to MIMEtype.          TypesConfig confmime.types            AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.          AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile  directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.

Negative 978 pI have a simple codemanytomanycode relation between two models and a join table.

Negative 978 pI am working with a very large dataframe 3.5 million X 150 and takes 25 gigs of memory when unpickled and I need to find maximum of one column over an id number and a date and keep strongonlystrong the row with the maximum value.  Each row is a recorded observation for one id at a certain date and I also need the latest date.  p  pThis is animal test data where there are twenty additional columns seg1seg20 for each id and date that are filled with test day information consecutively, for example, first test data fills seg1, second test data fills seg2 ect.  The value field indicates how many segments have been filled, in other words how many tests have been done, so the row with the maximum value has the most test data.  Ideally I only want these rows and not the previous rows.  For examplep  precodedf DataFrameid[1000,1000,1001,2000,2000,2000],            date[20010101,20010201,20010115,20010203,20010223,20010220],           value[3,1,4,2,6,6],            seg1[22,76,23,45,12,53],           seg2[23,,34,52,24,45],           seg3[90,,32,,34,54],           seg4[,,32,,43,12],           seg5[,,,,43,21],           seg6[,,,,43,24] df        date    id  seg1 seg2 seg3 seg4 seg5 seg6  value 0  20010101  1000    22   23   90                     3 1  20010201  1000    76                               1 2  20010115  1001    23   34   32   32                4 3  20010203  2000    45   52                          2 4  20010223  2000    12   24   34   43   43   41      6 5  20010220  2000    12   24   34   43   44   35      6 codepre  pAnd eventually it should bep  precode       date    id  seg1 seg2 seg3 seg4 seg5 seg6  value 0  20010101  1000    22   23   90                     3 2  20010115  1001    23   34   32   32                4 4  20010223  2000    12   24   34   43   43   41      6 codepre  pI first tried to use .groupbyid.max but couldnt find a way to use it to drop rows.  The resulting dataframe MUST contain the ORIGINAL ROWS and not just the maximum value of each column with each id.  My current solution isp  precodefor i in df.id.unique     df df.dropdf.loc[df.idi].sort[value,date].index[1] codepre  pBut this takes around 10 seconds to run each time through, I assume because its trying to call up the entire dataframe each time through.  There are 760,000 unique ids, each are 17 digits long, so it will take way too long to be feasible at this rate.p  pIs there another method that would be more efficient  Currently it reads every column in as an object but converting relevant columns to the lowest possible bit of integer doesnt seem to help either.p

Negative 978 pI am running an experiment with two experiments experiment1 and experiment2. Each experiment has 5 different treatments i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  We are trying to randomly assign the treatments within groups.p  pWe would like to do this via sampling without replacement iteratively within each group. We want to do this to insure that we get as a balanced a sample as possible in the treatment e.g. we dont want to end up with 4 subjects in group 1 getting assigned to treatment 2 and no one getting treatment 1. So if a group has 23 subjects, we want to split the respondent into 4 subgroups of 5, and 1 subgroup of 3. We then want to randomly sample without replacement across the first subgroup of 5, so everyone gets assigned 1 of the treatments, do the same things for the the second, third and 4th subgroup of 5, and for the final subgroup of 3 randomly sample without replacement. So we would guarantee that every treatment is assigned to at least 4 subjects, and 3 are assigned to 5 subjects within this group. We would like to do this for all the groups in the experiment and for both treatments. The resultant output would look something like this... p  precode         group   experiment1   experiment2     [1,]     1           5             3     [2,]     1           3             2     [3,]     1           4             4     [4,]     1           1             5     [5,]     1           2             1     [6,]     1           2             3     [7,]     1           4             1     [8,]     1           3             2     [9,]     2           5             5    [10,]     2           1             4    [11,]     2           3             4    [12,]     2           1             5    [13,]     2           2             1       .      .           .             .       .      .           .             .       .      .           .             . codepre  pI know how to use the codesamplecode function, but am unsure how to sample without replacement within each group, so that our output corresponds to above described procedure.

Negative 978 pDeveloping a complex virtual machine network to perform parallel computation and below is the problem statement.p  pVirtual machine architecture  composed of Controller virtual machineCVM and worker virtual machines, which are spawned on need basis to perform parallel computation.CVM will loop through the job queue and depending on the complexity of the job,will spawn one or more worker virtual machines. Worker virtual machine will report progress, error and completion, after its completion  worker will be shut down by the controller.Worker and Controller are linux based virtual machines.We would also want to keep it cloud agnostic and secure private network.p  pComputation Jobs are long running and CPU intensive.p  pNow question what would be the ideal way for the  workers to communicate with Controller on progress, error and completion.p  pWould Nodejs based REst full services make sense  Appreciate your thoughts.p

Negative 978 pIm creating reports for a Report Server, and given that it lacks a code editor to define fullbodied methods, any complex expressions used for setting properties can get very messy very quickly as they have to be a single statement.

Negative 978 pI think I am using Interceptors incorrectly in AngularJS. I want to use them to change a specific value in the response to a codeintervalcode so that it increments in the UI.p  pThe idea was to use an Interceptor to hijack the response and insert the codeintervalcode into the response before it reached the template. Nice idea but it doesnt work.p  pFirst issue is that I get errors when trying to reassign a property in the response.p  pThe second is that the Interceptor seems to be called for all requests, this isnt ideal as its only specific responses I need to change. This leads me to believe that Interceptors are for authentication and things that are needed for all requests.p  pBearing all this in mind I now know that Interceptors are not the way to go.p  pHow else should I solve this issue of needing to add in an codeintervalcode for certain values in a response There a few places that this needs to be done so I want to avoid having insert the codeintervalcode each time.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe two answers so far are great, now I have this which works and the values are right now they are reassigned, but the codeintervalcode is not working.

Now when user run it again while server and client processes are still running, it suppose to become client and send message to server about a new process started then terminate itself.p  pIt is all working good except the delegate is executing in server process instead  of client.p  pHere is the code.p  precode    const string PIPENAME  testPipeName33     const string OBJECTNAME  test     static RemoteObject remoteObject     static void RegisterClient              IpcClientChannel chan  new IpcClientChannel         ChannelServices.RegisterChannelchan, false          remoteObject  RemoteObjectActivator.GetObjecttypeofRemoteObject,                 string.Formatipc01, PIPENAME, OBJECTNAME          static void RegisterServer              BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider serverProvider  new BinaryServerFormatterSinkProvider         serverProvider.TypeFilterLevel  TypeFilterLevel.Full          IpcServerChannel chan  new IpcServerChannel, PIPENAME, serverProvider         ChannelServices.RegisterChannelchan, false          RemotingServices.Marshalnew RemoteObject, OBJECTNAME           [STAThread]     static void Mainstring[] args              Application.EnableVisualStyles         Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefaultfalse         if args.Length  0  args[0]  s                      try                              RegisterServer                          catch RemotingException                               try to register it with the pipe name.

Negative 978 pIs it possible to visualize the dependency tree from inside of Eclipse e.g. the output of codegradle dependenciescode Expanding the Gradle Dependencies tree in Eclipse is a flat view and does not show dependencies for other projects e.g. if I have a dependency codecompile projectproject2code, none of project2s dependencies are shown.p  pBased on a hrefhttpsdiscuss.gradle.orgtdoesgradleeclipsestsdependencytreeview9116 relnofollowthisa it looks like a tree view is not supportedp  pBasically Im looking for the equivalent of this in the maven pluginp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comwWheM.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwWheM.png altenter image description hereap
