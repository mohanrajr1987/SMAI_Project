Positive 865 pThis is a bit of a potentially multipart part question. My goal is to either be able to reset UI changes that users make, limit changes that users can make, in order to have a consistent environment in a multisession lab situation.p  pI have played with some registry settings that allow me to set background which I want to be a solid color and such, but the changes dont get applied till after a restart. Thus far I have found do way to Refresh the UI. And, ideally I could do this without a restart. In addition, if someone where to set a Theme, then my simple registry hacks are overridden and even after a restart they dont make a difference, so I would like to just disable the ability to set Themes. Now, I found a hrefhttpwww.askvg.comallkindsofrestrictionsforwindows2000xp2003andvista relnofollowthisa, but its all pre Vista references, and I am unable to make changes to the Policy key in HKCU. So, my questions are 1 Is there a way to limit certain changes to the UI programmatically And... 2 Is there a way to Refresh programmatically after resetting those changes I do allowp  pFor what it is worth, I am testing this with Windows 7 Home, but I would like to find a solution that would work in Windows 7 Pro up to various versions of Windows 10.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Positive 865 pLet me introduce the goal of the application Im building I am creating a frontend GUI using PySide Qt for a fortran based application used in the framework of CFD. The fortran application is compiled as a .exe file, and, when executed, it continuously provides the simulated lapse of time and other output details when I launch it from the console, these data continously appear until it finishes. p  pFor example, if I executed the external code from the console I would getp  precodegtgt myCFDapplication.exe    Initializing...

From other similar topics in this site, I have been able to launch my external application from Python using the following codep  precodeimport os, sys import subprocess  procExe  subprocess.Popenpru, shellTrue, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.PIPE, universalnewlinesTrue  while procExe.poll is None line  procExe.stdout.readline printPrint  line codepre  pbut the output is only displayed when the execution finishes, and moreover, the whole GUI freezes until that moment.p  pI would like to know how to launch my external application using Python, getting the output in real time and passing it to the GUI instantaneously, if possible. The idea would be to print the output in different lines inside a TextEdit dialog using the function appendeachoutputline.p

For my purposes, this level of precision is not necessary, assuming a perfect sphere is good enough.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIm fine tuning my question taking into account some of the responses.p  pcodebenjismithcode argues that my question cannot be answered because there is more than one shortest path between points on the globe. He has a lot of backing in the form of votes, so I guess theres something I dont understand, because I disagree.p  blockquote   pThe midpoint between any two locations   on a sphere is a circular arc.p blockquote  pI concede that this is true when two points are at complete opposites.  By this I mean that both points, while remaining on the surface of the sphere, could not be any further away from each other.  In this case there are infinite number of equidistant paths joining both points.  This, however, is an edge case, not the rule.  In all other cases, the vast majority of cases, there is a single shortest path.p  pTo illustrate if you were to hold a string which passed through two points, and pulled it tight, would there not be only one possible path on which the string would settle except the edge case already discussedp  pNow, prior to asking the question, obtaining the distance between two points and the heading was not a problem.p  pI guess what I should have asked is if the following is validp  precodedef getnewlocationcurrentlocation, targetlocation, percenttraveled     newlocation.lon  1percenttraveledcurrentlocation.lonpercenttraveledtargetlocation.lon     newlocation.lat  1percenttraveledcurrentlocation.latpercenttraveledtargetlocation.lat     return newlocation codepre  pIf I were to follow this path, would I be following the greatcircle, the rhumb line, ... or would I be completely off I know these terms now because of Drew Halls answer.p

But I cant see how the logo would work with absolute positioning if the design itself it in the center of the page. I think this is to make sure it works in IE6... I have tried floating the logo in the central header, and then applying a negative margin of codemarginleft 10pxcode which does work, but Ive read this doesnt work in IE6.p

Negative 865 pOk, this is for me a very tough challenge. Were taking our existing ASP.NET website and converting redesigning the PL only to MVC. Our site is very complex. But the hard part is to convert the existing custom controls to MVC equivilant. The custom controls I am not talking about user controls are just of course a class currently that inherits System.Web.UI.Control and uses that object throughout. For example, we have some properties at the top of this existing custom class like sop  precodeDictionaryltint, Controlgt configControls  DropDownList kControl  CheckBox confirmBox codepre  pThese all are variables of type Web controls in classic ASP.NET.p  pSo I figured maybe what I could do without building entire new custom controls from scratch is to use the HtmlHelper object. So I tried thisp  pinclude first the using statement that includes System.Web.MVC.Html at the top of my new custom class in our new web projectp  pprivate HtmlHelper helper  Dictionary configControls  helper.DropDownListp  pbut this is not working. I guess I cant use this object just like this  I figured I can use HtmlHelper in the Dictionary and then make variable types off of helper. but those are just extension methods, not objectsp  pI dont know of an equivalent to something like the generic Control we had available to us to inherit from such as in classic ASP.NET.  Surely it wont be the same in MVC obviusly stateless and a completely diff way of doing things but what can I use in MVC with the same concept sort ofp  pSo I figured maybe what I could do without building entire new custom controls from scratch is to use the HtmlHelper object. So I tried thisp  pinclude first the using statement that includes System.Web.MVC.Html at the top of my new custom class in our new web projectp  precodeprivate HtmlHelper helper  Dictionary configControls  helper.DropDownList codepre  pbut this is not working.  I dont even know if this approach will work in my custom control.  And when I try to use my helper variable, I get no extension methods unless its inside an existing extension method where the signature has an HtmlHelper param passed in.  So when I create that private variable just in my custom class outside, I get nothing in intellisense to choose from when doing helper..  So do I need to define that object like this p  precodeprivate HtmlHelper htmlHelper  new HtmlHelper codepre  pbut its asking for a ViewContext and an IViewDataContainer as params.  If Im building out a custom method that knows nothing yet about its view it shouldnt need to because Im simply creating strings of HMTL in this custom class to be passed to the Extension method to ultimately spit out fields then maybe I cant use HtmlHelper this way in a custom class like this.p  pSo can I use that object in a way instead of Control  Maybe I can even in my dictionary variable use type object in place of control   I dont know and then cast object to type HtmlHelper when I need to use or reference that value from the dictionary But for now, I figured I can use HtmlHelper object in the Dictionary and then make variable types off of helper. but those are just extension methods, not objects.p  pI hope I am making any sense here when you read this.p

Negative 865 pThere is something that I cannot understand in C. You can cast an outofrange codeintcode into an codeenumcode and the compiler does not flinch. Imagine this codeenumcodep  precodeenum Colour      Red  1,     Green  2,     Blue  3  codepre  pNow, if you writep  precodeColour eco eco  Colour17 codepre  pThe compiler thinks thats fine. And the runtime, too. Uhp  pWhy did the C team decide to make this possible This decision misses the point of using enums, I think, in scenarios like thisp  precodevoid DoSomethingWithColourColour eco      do something to eco.  codepre  pIn a strongtyped language like C, I would like to assume that codeecocode will always hold a legal codeColourcode value. But this is not the case. A programmer could call my method with a value of 17 assigned to codeecocode as in previous code snippet, so the code in my method must not assume that codeecocode holds a legal codeColourcode value. I need to test for it explicitly and handle the exceptional values as I please. Why is thisp  pIn my humble opinion, it would be much nicer if the compiler issued an error or even a warning message when casting an outof range codeintcode into an codeenumcode, if the codeintcode value is known at compile time. If not, the runtime should throw an exception at the assignment statement.p  pWhat do you think Is there any reason why this is sop  pNote.

If you have the XML element, you can access the shape like this var shapeDisplayObject  curElements[xmlElement]p  pThis works fine within the same class.p  pHowever, now I also have the ElementSelector class which deals with selection of shapes and reflects the actions done with the shape to the xml element. To do this, one needs to get the XML element when the shape has been clickedp  pemElementSelector.asemp  precodeprivate static var currentSelectionXML      fired when the stage has been clicked             private static function stageClickedeventMouseEventvoid                              if the element selector has been enabled                 if enabled                                      var allPagesArray  CodeHandler.getPageCodes                     var mainElementXML  allPages[CodeHandler.getCurPageId]                     var targetElementXML  CodeHandler.getDeepestElementAtPosmainElement, 0, event.stageX, event.stageY[xml]                     if targetElement.localName  page ampamp targetElement  currentSelection                      we have a new element selected                         Utils.logElementSelector now selecting   targetElement.localName                         selecttargetElement                                          else if targetElement.localName  page ampamp currentSelection                      the selection has been lost                         Utils.logElementSelector now dropping selection.                         deselect                                                                 sets the new selection             private static function selectelementXMLvoid                              if currentSelection deselect                 currentSelection  element                  var curElementsDictionary  PageRenderer.getElements                 var renderDisplayObject  curElements[element]                 tracerender                   drops the current selection             private static function deselectvoid                              currentSelection  null              codepre  pI added the StageClicked event function only so you have an idea of how my procedure works.

Negative 865 pWhen sql server is receiving two queries SELECT  From theSameTable, at exactly the same time, and if u have a server with multiple processors, Can sql server retrieve the data at the same timep  pI am trying to understand what will happen if a cheap select statement that finish within .01 sec, and 1000 users run the same query exactly at the same time.  I think what will happen that if the server is having four processors, then SQL server will serve the first four in .01 sec and serve next four users in 0.02 sec, extra.p  pIs that even close to what will actually happenp  pI think I will try to use some kind of code and loggers to test that, or maybe there is reliable testing tools to do that.p  pThanks  p

Negative 865 pI have created a windows service which is continuously polling a database. For this purpose i have a timer in place. Ever time i am querying a database table i open a connection and close it immediately after my work is done.

In my controller I have the following in my awakeFromNibp  precode    NSMatrix matrix  [[NSMatrix alloc]                            initWithFrame[matrixContainerView bounds]                                    modeNSRadioModeMatrix                                cellClass[MyCustomCell class]                             numberOfRows5                         numberOfColumns5]      [matrix setCellSizeNSMakeSize116, 96]     [matrix setNeedsDisplayYES]      [matrixContainerView addSubview[matrix autorelease]]      [matrixContainerView setNeedsDisplayYES] codepre  pThe class codeMyCustomCellcode header looks like the followingp  precodeinterface MyCustomCell  NSCell       MyModel  theObject    MyModel theObject voidsetTheObjectMyModel newValue codepre  pAnd the implementation file as follows drawing simplifiedp  precodeimplementation MyCustomCell  voiddrawInteriorWithFrameNSRecttheFrame inViewNSView theView       ...drawing code using MyModel e.g. [MyModel isValid] etc...    MyModel theObject      return theObject   voidsetTheObjectMyModel newValue      [theObject autorelease]     theObject  [newValue retain]   end codepre  pAfter some initialization and population of the array containing codeMyModelcode objects in the controller, I want to populate the codeNSMatrixcode with instances of the objects.p  pHow do I do thisp  pI have tried adding just two objects from the array as follows just as a testp  precodeMyCustomCell  cellOne  MyCustomCell [matrix cellAtRow0 column0] [cell setTheObject[myArrayOfObjects objectAtIndex0]]  MyCustomCell  cellTwo  MyCustomCell [matrix cellAtRow0 column1] [cellTwo setTheObject[myArrayOfObjects objectAtIndex1]] codepre  pBut this just creates the first object image. If the above had worked, it would been a straightforward task of enumerating through the array and adding the objects.p  pHow do I go about adding the cells and passing the appropriate objects to those cells in order that they can be displayed correctlyp  pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.commaclibrarydocumentationcocoaConceptualMatrixMatrix.htmlapplerefdocuid10000022CJBEGHBI relnofollowApple docsa are sparse to say the least on NSMatrix as far as the programming guide goes. The information in there is very useful to me, but only after I have added the objects and got them displayingp  pAs usual any and all help much appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIf I do not add the two objects as per my example above the output is no different, i.e. a single representation of my custom cell is drawn to screen. This tells me that the single representation I see is being done at the initialization of the matrix and in fact I wasnt drawing anything to column 0 row 0 when in fact I thought I was. Which leaves me now more confused.p

Negative 865 pI am implementing a web server API for my application, and I got stuck in the process of figuring out what authentication method I should use to authenticate requests by the users and also by other client applications. I think that I did not really understand what OAuth and other authentication protocols are made for.p  pI want the authentication to be performed without the intervention of a web browser, entirely from my iPhone app, or another custom thirdparty client. Is sessionbased authentication the good way to go here How does for example the Facebook iPhone client authenticates itself with the web API I dont think it uses OAuth or anything like that, since touch loginauthorization form is never displayed. OAuth is, as far as I know, used only for thirdparty apps. But why is that so Couldnt the iPhone client be considered a thirdparty app toop  pI am sorry if my questions are vague and unclear, please point me out with the details that are missing and such. Thank you.p

Negative 865 pIve read the MongoDB documentation, and it comes with a warning about 32bit systems particularly that theyre capped at 2 GB of available RAM for Mongo. p  pSo I was wondering if that statement meant anything in regards in running MongoDB in a low memory setting like Linodes 512mb of RAM based VPS.

It might be a short coming of my knowledge of Innos but I cannot figure out how to know where that file will be to tell innos that.p  pSo then I thought I had a clever solution  Innos can run a file when its done uninstalling, so I had my program create this file uninstallData.bat that saysp  precodedel the file in my special folder application data path codepre  pand I wrote it out to emdrumrollemp  precodeApplication.ExecutablePath  codepre  pyes it was a while in development and I had forgot it wast doable.p  pSo of course I am back to square one, I need to write a file to a path Innos knows about app  and I need it to be able to delete my data file in the SpecialFolder... i dont care how I do it i just need that file gone.p  pAre there other Environment. or Application. approches I have missed  Maybe somewhere that is viewable by an uninstaller AND can be written top  pAs an aside, I am not sure why my box I develop on can write to the application folder no issue, but it cannot on other boxes... weird.p  pAny input would be great sorta lost as to how to crack this nut.p

Negative 865 pI understand when an activity closes, onDestroy is called. But this is not done always right Sometimes, onPause is called.p  pSo suppose I want to clear some memory when an activity closes, where exactly do I do it Since onDestory may not be called, I cannot keep it there either rightp  pElaborating I have 2 activities A1 and A2. A1 is hsown in the startup of the app. A1 calls A2 later. Suppose I create a class object in onCreate of Activity A1. This object must be deleted when the I exit the app, i.e when the app is no longer visible. Is the best place to do this onDestroy or onStop of A1 I guess onPause may not be the right place, because onPause will be called when A1 calls A2 and I dont want to delete the object then.p  pKikip
Negative 865 pIve got a select element with a large number of option elements and Im looking for a way to toggle between having all options available and having a subset of the options available for selection the subset being the most popular options.  The options are ordered alphabetically and are grouped by their values initial letter.p  pIf the user doesnt see the option they want while browsing the select element showing a subset of options, it would be nice to be able to select an option named something like show more Bs and, without collapsing the select element, the full set of options magically appear. By collapsing, Im talking about the normal behaviour of a select element when one of its options is selected.p  pIt would obviously be easy to select an option and trigger repopulation of the select element, but from a users perspective, its not exactly intuitive if the select element has to collapse in order to repopulate  my feeling is that the user might imagine they need to click the search button to see more Bs when in fact they would need to reopen the select.p  pSo my question then is it possible to repopulate or add options to a select element without collapsing itp  pI have, of course, trawled the web looking for a solution and found nothing of value  this could of course be down to my possible lackof searchfu.  I feel like there ought to be a javascript solution not my forte and ideally a jquery one, so better ask some experts methoughteth.  Naturally, Im open to other elegant and intuitive solutions to achieve the same result, should my question return a resounding strongNostrong.p  pThanks for reading.p

Negative 865 pIm writing an application that should process large ammounts of data between 110 GB as realtime as possible. p  pthe data is present in multiple binary data files on harddisk, each between few kb and 128MB. when the process starts, first it is decided which data is actually needed. then some user settings are taken through the userinterface and then the data is processed chunk by chunk where always a file is loaded into memory, processed, and then cleared from the memory. this processing should be fast because the user can change some settings and then the same data is reprocessed and this user interaction should be as fluent as possible.p  pNow the loading from disk is quite some bottleneck and I would like to preload the data already at the stage where its decided what files will be used. however  if I preload too much data, the os will use virtual memory and ill have plenty of pagefaults, making the processing even slower.p  phow can I determine how much data to preload in order to keep pagefaults low can I influence the os somehow on what data I want to keep in memoryp  pthanksp  pedit im currently running on Windows 7 64 the application is 32bit however and the application does not need to run on any computer  only on a specific one since this is a research project.p

Negative 865 pIm building a very small gem to read an image data format and return the image either as a boring ruby array, or a nice a hrefhttpnarray.rubyforge.org relnofollownarraya, depending on a if an narray has been requested and b if the narray gem is available and required.  My design is that if someone wants to use narray they can, but they have to require it explicitly beforehand.  When reading the image data, I check to see if narray is defined has been required, and simply adds a warning to a msg instance variable for later printinglogging.p  pId like to include a test for this Im using rspec2 and mocha for mocking but Im a little new to actually using rspec.  Id like to do something likep  precodeit should return an narray if requested do   obj  NRead.newstring, bin gt true, narray gt true   obj.imagenarray.shouldnot benil end  it should add an NArray Install message and not set the imagenarray if NArray was not available do   Object.stubsdefined.withNArray.returnsfalse   obj  NRead.newstring, bin gt true, narray gt true   obj.msg.shouldnot beempty   obj.msg.grepPlease gem install narray.empty.should befalse   obj.imagenarray.should benil   obj.imagerubyarray.size.should  fixtureimagelength end codepre  p...but I must be missing the point of using stubs, because this stubbing isnt changing the behavior of defined.  Regardless of the stub, defined returns the real value i.e. if I uncomment the require in the code, defined is false and my warning is successfully added.p  pIs this not even worth testing  Is there a better way to do this  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks,p

Negative 865 pThe iPhone 4s Retina display is double the density of of the iPhone 3, but Apple handled it fairly nicely but just making an assumption and doubling the pixels when rendering so that your web page looks the same physical size on each device. You can then use some webkit media queries to load additional CSS just for that device webkitmindevicepixelratio2.p  pThe question Is there a resource that a lists the other mobile devices that are now using high PPI screens b what the device does by default in terms of rendering web sites and c if it supports the webkit check andor its own custom detection methodp  pIf not, perhaps this post could become that resource CW by posting info on specific devices as answers. I have to start dealing with BlackBerry and Nokia devices that are using the high res screens and Android coming along. Any data appreciatedp  pUPDATE p  pAfter some testing, Im finding that there really arent any other mobile devices that identify themselves as doubledensity as the iPhone 4 does. There are screens with much higher PPIs now often on smaller devices but the device doesnt in any way declare itself as high PPI. Perhaps a better way to explain it is that those devices just have really small pixels.p  pAs such, there really isnt a practical way to handle those devices given that ALL sites are rendered the same, so any attempt at modifying yours will likely interfere with the users own preferences and settings.p  pIf anyone knows of any devices other than the iPhone 4 that properly declare themselves as high PPI, let me nowp

Control size cannot be changed, skins do not work in embedded mode I was told sop  pWhat are viable alternatives The choices are endlessp  ul lipuse a different player VLC for instance but it crashes all the timepli lipwriting own media control bar  the volume slider is a problempli lipcalling windows media player in standalone mode the user cannot be prevented to do too muchpli lipembedding a html page, and this one has something else embedded, a silverlight player for instance.pli lipembedding a flash player, converting movie clips to a different format beforepli lipembedding a customized solution provided by a powepoint MVP or some other expertpli ul  pthe list goes on and on. I dont have the time to research all of them in depth. What is the most practical alternative Thanks.p

Negative 865 pI want to call an external program from within python, but this external program tries to interact with the user by using an internal script in the telemarketer sense to ask questions and change questions based on answers given.  The creators of this program are also known for occasionally changing the text of some of these questions, or even worse, the order in which they are asked.  p  pIm thinking it wouldnt be too hard to write a python module that maps arguments to the wrapper as answers to questions asked by the external program.  I could then use difflib, for example, to do some fuzzy matching to try to make the mapping more robust in the event of an order or text change in the external program.p  pBefore doing so I thought I would ask if something like this already exists, as I seem to have a tickling sensation of having seen something similar before, but cant recall the specifics.p  pThanksp

Negative 865 pI need to write an app that only takes a webservice address as input for now it can be just a simple http address with default webservice configuration as generated with all typical WCF introductory Visual Studio examples. I then need to determine the contract on the service and all methods of the contract with types of the parameters as well. p  pNow, Im not finding any examples on the net on how to do this. However, the WcfTestClient.exe of VS2008 does precisely this. You type in an address, it seems to connect to it for a few seconds so Im guessing it doesnt just parse the wsdl file for information, as that wont take even 1 second and then shows all contracts and methods on the contract for you in a neat list. Also, the WSDL doesnt show the exact types of the parameters to the contract methods.p  pHow can I do this programmatically myself If that test app simply calls the wsdl.exe and generates proxy classes in the background and then use reflection, I probably cant go this route, as I cant call command line .exes in my program. If this is the case though, my question becomes, how can I do what wsdl.exe does... only have a web service address and get all information needed for those proxy classes. And of course use Reflection somewhere, which is my first prize here.  p  pAny other help on where to even start to resolve this issue will be greatly appreciated. Im fairly new to WCF and webservices, so be warned.p  pThank you p

Negative 865 pI have a query about .Net Remoting, versioning and creating client activated objects.p  pHere is the scenariop  pThere are 2 interfaces, residing in their own assembly SharedTypes IServer and IAccount. IServer contains methods GetStatus which returns a string, and CreateAccount which returns an IAccount type. This is registered into the GAC as v1.0.0.0.p  pServer application references SharedTypes and implements IServer and IAccount with concrete classes,  Server and Account. These are MarshalByRefObject objects. The Server application marshals the Server class as a singleton object.p  pClient application references SharedTypes and connects to the remoteable Server object through the IServer interface successfully. Here I can call GetStatus and CreateAccount which returns a client activated object successfully. All OK so far.p  pNow I increment the version of SharedTypes to v2.0.0.0 and register into the GAC, removing the old v1.0.0.0 version.p  pThe Server application is built against this version, but the client is not.p  pNow when I run the client application, it will as expected complain with a System.IO.FileNotFoundException, i.e. it could not find v1.0.0.0 of SharedTypes in the GAC.p  pIf I copy v1.0.0.0 of SharedTypes in the exe directory of the client, the client application eventually binds to this after GAC lookup was unsuccessful. The client application starts and I can call the GetStatus on the IServer object successfully through the singleton object. However, if I call CreateAccount  which should return a client activated object, I get the following exceptionp  precodeSystem.InvalidCastException Return argument has an invalid type.    at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.ValidateReturnArgObject arg, Type paramType    at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PropagateOutParametersIMessage msg, Object[] outArgs, Object returnValue    at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PrivateInvokeMessageDataamp msgData, Int32 type    at SharedTypes.IServer.GetAccount codepre  pMy question is why does calling GetStatus on the server activated singleton object from the client which is using v1.0.0.0 not throw this exception, whereas creating the client activated object through CreateAccount does Since both types are created on the server, I would have thought that GetStatus call would have resulted in the same exceptionp

Negative 865 pHopefully this will be a simple answer, I am new to both Ruby and Sinatra.p  pI am looking at writing a sinatra app using the modular approach, however I am wanting to be able to add new routes in a plugin fashion.p  pCurrently I have my SinatraApp class which inherits from SinatraBase, now I have a method in there called loadplugins which goes through the plugins folder and includes all routingdefinition.rb files, which are modules containing more routes.p  pSo with that context to the question, I am wondering how Sinatra manages its routing. Is it a case of when it first initializes it loads the SinatraApp and then keeps it in memory within the rack process or whatever you are running it within, or is the SinatraApp reevaluated every requestp  pTake the scenario, UserA loads up a route which returns a html page, UserA clicks a link and it returns a 404 as the plugin doesnt exist, AdminA then adds a new plugin into the plugins folder, UserA then refreshes their page and they get a html page rather than a 404, as the plugin has added the route.p  pWould the above happen, or would I need to restart the Sinatra server to get it to pick up the new plugin filep  pPart of me hopes it would update loaded plugins each request... however part of me knows that would hammer performance if every request it needs to scan directories for plugins.p  p EDIT p  pHave added an example of what I mean below. I am not sure if it should be structured like a module or left inline as below, if include literally code dumps into the current scope so the get  would know it should be calling get within the scope of the SinatraMain app, either way it gives you an indication of what I am after.p  precoderequire sinatra  class SinatraMain lt SinatraBase      def loadplugins         Dir[pluginsroutingplugin.rb].each  do pluginfile              include pluginfile         end     end    get test do     return This is a test route   end  get plugins do    loadplugins    return Plugins refreshed end end  SinatraMain.run   Imagine this was within pluginsSayHelloPluginroutingplugin.rb get sayhello     return Saying hello end codepre  pSo the idea is that whenever these empluginem files are added to the plugins folder it should then add the routes to the application, and when they are removed take them out of the routing although the latter point isnt as important for now.p

Negative 865 pI recently reinstalled Zend Server which includes Apache2 to a different directory on my machine, and moved my project there. However, I ran into a bit of a problem.

It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsfoo.log  with ServerRoot set to CZendApache2 will be interpreted by the  server as CZendApache2logsfoo.log.   NOTE Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes  instead of backslashes e.g., capache instead of capache.  If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located  will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply  an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.   ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive  at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple  httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.  ServerRoot CZendApache2   Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.          CustomLog logsaccess.log common           If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog logsaccess.log combined ltIfModulegt ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar           Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.           ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.

If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, textplain is  a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications  or images, you may want to use applicationoctetstream instead to  keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are  text.  DefaultType textplain ltIfModule mimemodulegt           TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from      filename extension to MIMEtype.          TypesConfig confmime.types           AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz           AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi      For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var           Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.

AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt   The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.

Negative 865 pI am having an issue where I sometimes get severe hangtime between an onClick call and the following process. In the code below youll see I have a couple of Logs to help reference. Occasionally, 1020 of the time, the app will utterly freeze up on the codesynchronizedSurfaceHoldercode in the method codedoTouchEventcode. Im talking 7 seconds.

Not to mention it only happens every so often.p  pThe LogCat will explain better what I mean. Youll notice it was stuck for over 20 seconds before I onClick a second time and break out of it. Often it will remain frozen through the second, third and fourth onClick and then rapidly finish each call. Id say the average delay is around 10 seconds.

Negative 865 pBoth, GCDAsyncSocket and AsyncSocket titles state they are asynchronous, both look similar. However, all stuff about sockets is about handling a single continuous stream of unlimited length, coming from TCP data packets. At first, I was a little bit confused, thought AsyncSocket does some magic by making custom request and response packets and handling them for me asynchronously for example if I make request A,B,C then a response from a server might come in a different order, for example B,C,A. After a bit of digging into the world of sockets, I understood the data coming both from a server via socket reads is verrry synchronous, not asynchronous. Its all about reading one stream, cutting it into the packets and making callbacks to my delegate class, and if I make requests A,B,C then responses from a server will come in the same order A,B,C.  AFAIK, AsyncSocket uses main run loop, so its again using main thread, main queue. So, what its part is about being asynchronousp

Negative 865 pI am currently using Intels MKL 2D FFT routines.p  pI am running into a condition where the performance is changing by a factor of 45.p  pWhat I am doing is implementing a type of band pass filter using FFT libraries.  The results of test are correct, but the speed is an issue.p  pWhat I am seeing is about 1.3 sec on the forward FFT and between 1.3 and 6 seconds on the inverse FFT.p  pI have tracked this down to the weights I am applying after the forward pass of the FFT. The weights are between 0 and 1, mostly 0 when I am getting the 6 seconds. If I set the weights to 1 before applying the time is 1.3 seconds.   Other test show this kind of behavior without using weights of 1.p  pMy questions is how can the values I am applying cause this kind of slow down  I could understand a minor change in execution time, but not this dramatic of a change. p  pThanks, Jim Kp  pI dont know if this is specific to the MKL version of the FFT or a general issue.p

I want to change that as well, and as an extra include mobile support.p  pi researched Flash, java and HTML5, the two most obvious choice in web applications, and pretty much the new comer HTML5. p  pFlash is more widely used as web appat least what i saw and found., and its more designer oriented than programmer, but many chats are written in this, and are used. but there is no mobile support for it, to my knowledge. thats hinders my future plans.p  pJava, is a robust programming language, and saw a few webchats in this, but my main issue with this is performance its much  slower than flash. But at least  there is  mobile support, at least the android mobiles.p  pas for HTML5....its pretty much still a child, not all web browsers support it fully but the major ones support web socket already, except IE9. and IE9 is the most used web browser, sadly. And i cant find any support for it on mobiles yet.p  pAnd i dont know any other platforms out there in the Internet that could do the same as the above three, but im open.p  pSo my question is Which is the best platform for writing a webchat, that lest me do mobile support at a latter stagep

Negative 865 pI am new to android dev, and I have been trying for a few hours now to add nice and smooth rounded corners to an ImageView, without success.p  pFirst thing I tried is simply to round corners of my images directly, but this implies changing the bitmap, and since I need to keep the raw ones, and those are pretty big, this is not really memory friendly. This would also cause other difficulties since my ImageView is fluid.p  pSecond thing I tried to use is the clipPath method after subclassing my view. This works, but corners are aliased. I then tried adding a PaintFlagsDrawFilter to implement the aliasing, but this didnt worked.

I dont have any javascript firing off this event, and what wanted to do was if user is in searchBox and hits enter, they fire the SearchClick otherwise if they are in either the username or password textbox and hit enter they fire off te code associated to loginClick.

However, it said that  we not only need to define the new scheduling macro in kernelsourcecodeincludelinuxsched.h  but also need to define the same thing in usrincludebitssched.h.p  pSo why do we need to change the user space head file since the scheduler works in the kernel.

Negative 865 pI have carefully read all the post that are on topic and Android push notifications. Basically, for a small sum, according to this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6923497androidmillionsofpushnotificationsAndroid amp millions of push notificationsa, defining three possibilities Google Cloud Message, MQTT and XMPP.p  pAbout Google Cloud Message I see some advantages and some drawbacks versions of Android, have installed Google Play, count of active google, does not guarantee delivery of notifications in order, etc. ..p  pMQTT not know but I discard my readings or their complexity and difficult integration with the other components.p  pI opted for XMPP, as it is the server that I use to make the plays the game app.p  pWhen you are playing a game and player A moves, it sends a message in the chat room he shares with player B, who receives, analyzes and performs the necessary actions in their client app. Thus the development of the game takes place in chat rooms.p  pBut I also like the style of WhastApp or AngryWords, that when a player does not have the application open and the other player sends a challenge to start playing or make a play, a notice appeared in Android.p  pThis is what I call, I hope Im wrong, push notification. The customer does not ask at certain intervals polling, but will be the server who initiates the process after the event. I understand that all the methods described, XMPP and therefore, involve having a TCP  IP open permanently.p  pBut is it necessary to perform a publish  subscribe. If I have 10,000 users, they have to publish  subscribe in pairs Could do with chat messages to certain types of full JIDp  pFinally, as to do that only when the app is not open on the device there is a notification in the status bar.p  pthanksp

Negative 865 pSo I have a system where users can forecast up until the 18th day following the end of a month.  However, during the month they are entering actuals on a day to day basis.p  pSo say the current date is 12th September 2012.  I have a forecast for this month of 100 units and I already have actuals entered into the system of 25 units.p  pBecause the 18th October hasnt been reached I would report September as having a forecast figure of 100 units.  However, the users want to also be able to see the 25 units that they have entered to date.p  pI have two measures in my report, one for Actuals and one for Forecasts.  If I allow the actuals for September to appear in the report then I will be displaying a figure of 125 units which is obviously incorrect and will make my year total also incorrect.p  pI considered adding a new measure Transient Actuals, that would only be used in the current month and wouldnt accumulate, but this seems crazy  p  pI dont think the technologies really matter at all but I am using a SQL Server database and the report is an Analysis Services cube.p  pSurely this must be a common problemp  hr  pOkay  I do have a schema but it is very, very complicated and there are multiple layers between the report and the database tables.  However, I can give you a simple SQL example.p  precodeActuals and Forecast Tables DECLARE Actuals TABLE      [Month] INT,     Value NUMERIC19,2 DECLARE Forecast TABLE      [Month] INT,     Value NUMERIC19,2  Pretending we are in Month 3 put in some dummy data INSERT INTO Actuals VALUES 1, 100 INSERT INTO Actuals VALUES 2, 120 INSERT INTO Actuals VALUES 3, 10 INSERT INTO Forecast VALUES 1, 90 INSERT INTO Forecast VALUES 2, 90 INSERT INTO Forecast VALUES 3, 90  Calculate the latest actuals period this would usually be timebased DECLARE LatestActualsPeriod INT  2  Now report the data to the user SELECT     [Month],     Actuals AS Source,     Value FROM     Actuals WHERE     [Month] lt LatestActualsPeriod UNION ALL SELECT     [Month],     Forecast,     Value FROM     Forecast WHERE     [Month] gt LatestActualsPeriod codepre  pNow the results of that will be a table with the following datap  precodeMonth    Source    Value 1        Actuals   100.00 2        Actuals   120.00 3        Forecast   90.00 codepre  pSo where do I put the 10.00 actuals in Month 3 without making the totals incorrect and still displaying the forecast for the same month somewherep  hr  pOkay, thanks to Jeremy I think I have the answer... the problem is that I have data like this in my reportp  precodeRow Labels  Actual   Forecast Total 2012    23.840  18.840  42.680 2012Jan    3.580   0.000   3.580 2012Feb    3.520   0.000   3.520 2012Mar    4.000   0.000   4.000 2012Apr    3.350   0.000   3.350 2012May    3.440   0.000   3.440 2012Jun    3.090   0.000   3.090 2012Jul    2.860   0.000   2.860 2012Aug    0.000   4.990   4.990 2012Sep    0.000   3.500   3.500 2012Oct    0.000   4.130   4.130 2012Nov    0.000   2.710   2.710 2012Dec    0.000   3.510   3.510 Grand Total 23.840  18.840  42.680 codepre  pThis is an Analysis Services cube so I cant have anything like 90 Actual 10 Forecast displaying, each cell must contain a number.  However, I have another solution.  If I add a new dimension with two members I can use this to control what is displayed.p  pSo the new dimension will have two choices, Show All or Show Relevant I might need to work on the names.  If the user has the Show All member selected then they will see any Actuals and Forecasts that the system holds.  So this means that their total will be meaningless as it will include forecasts AND actuals for months up to and including the present month and just forecasts for future months.p  pHowever, if the user selects the Show Relevant member then they will only see the Actuals for months that havent been completed and forecasts for future months as shown above.p  pThis will mean that every report will need to include this dimension and force the users to pick one of the members or their figures will be totally meaningless so it isnt the most elegant solution.p

Negative 865 pSo Im getting started using Akka actors inside of my Play 2.0 app. I noticed quickly that repeated calls to sending messages to the same actor, specified viap  precodeval myActor  Akka.system.actorOfProps[MyActor], name  myactor codepre  pResulted in codeInvalidActorNameExceptioncode. p  pI then started reading up on the creation of Actors in this a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakka2.0.2scalaactors.htmlCreatingActorswithdefaultconstructor relnofollowdocap  pThe doc seemed to recommend creating a master Actor class with all of the individual actors specified in there. The codereceivecode of this actor class would, in turn, match on the message and delegate the message to the appropriate Actor.p  pSo I tried this and now have something likep  precodeclass MasterActor extends Actor   import context.   val emailActor  actorOfProps[EmailActor], name  emailActor   protected def receive       case reminder  BirthdayReminder gt emailActor  reminder      codepre  pProblem is that Im in the same situation I was before.

Negative 865 pI have a WiX installer that installs as a Domainadmin a service I wrote and starts it after completion. It has to run on Windows XP as well as Windows 7. It worked fine on both operating systems.p  pThen I had to make a few changes to the service itself. So I made the changes, increased the version number of my installer so that it updates the service,and recompiled the service as well as its installer. I did not make any other changes to the installer.p  pThe installer still works perfectly on Windows 7, however on Windows XP it doesnt. On Windows XP it gets stuck somehow. The progress bar of the installation is not filling. You cant click the CancelButton you can click it but then it says cancelling in the window and nothing is happening. According to the taskmanager the program is not unresponsive and you can still move the window around without a problem.p  pI tried to look in the installation folder of the service to see if there is some action going on but the explorer freezes if you open it. I also tried to see if the service would be already registered in the services but computer management also freezes if you open services. There are no errors being produced in the errorlog. The CPU and RAM usage is absolutely normal.p  pHas anyone an idea what happend or how me making changes to the service itself broke my installer on XP Thank you very much for your Help.p  pEDIT 172013p  pI only added a codeThread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture  new System.Globalization.CultureInfodeDEcode to main method of the service and to all Threads started by this service. Thats all I changed.p  pIt does not make a difference if you do a clean install or an upgrede.p  pI found out that after you kill the service and forcefully because pressing shutdown causes the whole OS to freeze restart the computer the Installer exits with an error telling me that I dont have sufficient privileges to install system services. I am in the administrator group. And the installer shouldnt use my account for installation anyway. After this the installer cancels its actions by removeing the files it has added. If you restart the computer once again and try to install the service it gets stuck as described at exactly the same step that produces the error at the first try [I noticed that throu running the installer with logging enabled as recommended by Daniel]p  pI furthermore found out that the installer does not remove the service from services as it cancels its actions after the error but removes the registry entries for the service. Ok the service is gone. The refresh yust didnt work as I expected.p  pApparently the problem isnt a result of my changes at all because the version of the installer and service that worked previously now produce the exact same bahaviourp

Negative 865 pI basically have a Title bar with a UIWebView behind it. I have set the UIEdgeInsets of the UIWebView.scrollView to be such that the top of the Web page is at the bottom of the Title bar. Everything works as I expect except when the web page loads it moves the top of the UIWebView and ignores the UIEdgeInsets.p  pThe behavior is particularly strange because while a web page is loading, parts of the web page are shown and are in the correct position with the top of the web page just below the Title bar as it should be because of the UIEdgeInsets. However, once the web page completes loading it suddenly jumps up to the top of the UIWebView and ignores the UIEdgeInsets.p  pThe workaround I am currently using is to set the contentOffset to the correct position immediately after the page loads, but this is not ideal because you can see it jumping to the top of the UIWebView then jumping back down to the bottom of the Title bar.p  pDoes anyone know if there is something I can do to stop it jumping to the top of the UIWebView, either by forcing it to ignore the message to scroll to CGPointZero, or by setting the Start Position to be the at the bottom of the title bar please note, I have tried setting the origin to this point and it did not resolve the issuep  pAny help would be much appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 865 pI have the apache mod pagespeed installed, everything appears to be working ok. p  pI am using it on my ruby 1.9.3 and rails 3.2 app. I recently installed the gem turbolinks.p  pNow the URLs on my site are getting codeModPagespeednoscriptcodeadded after the trailing slash. This didnt happen before I added turbolinks. p  pWhy does the page speed tool append ModPagespeednoscript to the end of URLs and how can I prevent thisp  pIf turning off a few of the mod pagespeed options were to help then I can maybe do that with no performance loss, eg, minifying js is something I do pre deploy in a precompile, likewise, the Rails asset pipeline does a good job of combining individual .js and .css files into compiled single files etc. Therefore, turning off codecombine javascriptcode wouldnt be a problem. However, I dont know if this is what is causing it, as I implied I believe it is to do with the interaction of turbolinks, my apps http requests and the pagespeed module just not noticing that js is turned on.p  pI must admit I find it odd that I cant find even a remotely similar query to this online. p

Negative 865 pIm seeking a more streamlined and robust approach to keeping my rvm environment intact after an OS update.  Im using Mountain Lion, rvm 1.18.16 and homebrew, which has readline, gettext, libxml2, libxslt, qt, gtk  the gems that usually break for me are nokogiri and capybarawebkitp  pTwice now after updating Mountain Lion and XCode, my native extension gems and Ruby have suffered breakage and I have to spend time getting everything working again.  I have to wonder if Im following the best practice for getting all the rvm components updated after such system update.p  pWhat typically happens is that gems with native extensions are linking against old libraries that are no longer available, especially with the libxml issues surrounding Mountain Lion.  Heres the basic steps I take to get my system back online across all projects I have about 8 versions of Ruby installed under rvm, so this is tedious.p  pFirst, update Mountain Lion and XCode via the App Store.p  pSecond, Update homebrew withp  precodebrew update brew upgrade codepre  pThen list your rubies and start recompiling each one with...p  precodervm list rvm reinstall ruby1.9.2p290 rvm reinstall ruby1.9.3p392 ... codepre  pNOTE  I did try p  precodervm all do reinstall codepre  pbut that gave me this error reinstall command not foundp  pNext up, step through each ruby and perform pristine on the gems this has side effect of recompiling all native extension gemsp  precodervm use ruby1.9.3p392 gem pristine all codepre  pFinally, go to each project and perform the followingp  precodebundle install codepre  pIm not sure if that last step is strictly necessary  some projects seemed to be ok, some werent, but running this seemed to clear up last remaining issues.p  pSurely theres a more streamlined way to manage this process  Ive only been using both Mountain Lion and rvm for a couple months, but in that time, two system updates have killed most of my working Ruby environment.  I have a lot of Ruby versions installed because of my job as a consultant and encountering many development environments, so Id really like to get this down to an easily repeatable process.p  pAny thoughts  Can the above be further improvedp

Negative 865 pRecently I have tried to use G1GC from jdk1.7.017 in my java processor which is processing a lot of similar messages received from an MQ about 1520 reqsec. Every message is processed in the separate thread about 100 threads in stable state that serviced by Java limited thread pool. Surprisingly, I detected the strange behaviour  as soon as GC starts the full gc cycle it begins to use significant processing time up to 100 CPU and even more. I was doing refactoring of the code several times having a goal to optimizing it and doing it more lightweight. But without any significant result  the behaviour is the same. I use the 4core 64bit machine with Debian OS 2.6.325 kernel.

Negative 865 pas you can tell by the title, I am working on trying to brute force the factorization of large integers whose factors are 2 primes. I was wondering if there was a way to use a for loop inside a for loop for this. I know this is a TERRIBLE way to do it but i would like to do it anyways.

Negative 865 pIs there any such way to determine how much an image could be enlarged until it is considered out of focusp  pstrongA practical examplestrong and the problem Im trying to solvep  pI have an image saved at several different sizes, say 500x500, 250x250, and 120x120. I want to serve the most efficient image, but also the most clear. If a user was to request an image at 125x125, obviously increasing the 120x120 image to accommodate would not only be most efficient but most likely would not cause any apparent pixelation.p  pYet, if a user was to request an image at 180x180, it may be more efficient to increase the 120x120 image, but most likely would render a blurry image. In this case, I would want to shrink the 250x250 image.p  pObviously the clarity of an image can be relative and vary from eye to eye, as well as image to image, but Im wondering if there is any sort of algorithm or function to determine a pixelation index of sorts...Thanksp  pNote using PHP amp ImageMagick for image manipulations, so any answer in that realm would be great...p  pstrongFor Clarificationstrong Im not exactly looking for a emsolutionem to my above example.

Negative 865 pHello Im getting into Winsock programming in C. I believe that in order for me to access the  or any other header related to Winsock for that matter header file I have to have Visual C 2010 installed and set it as my default compiler. So I download it, and in CodeBlocks I set it to my compiler. I run some Winsock code and I get this message p  precodeCUsersJaredDocumentsTest.c6fatal error C1083 Cannot open include file winsock2.h No such file or directory codepre  pI also get this message for including winsock.h and windows.h. This has something to do with the Visual C compiler. I try installing Visual C 2008 and use it as my compiler and get the same message. I then read that I have to install microsofts SDK. I download and install it and it gets an error saying that I cant install it this is the .Net framework 4.0 version. I then try the 3.5 version and it installs fine but my compiler still cant find the header files. I have the .net framework 4.0 so I dont see  the problem. I also read that I have to include some header files in Visual C by going to ToolsOptionsProjects and SolutionsVC Directories and I get the following message p  precodeVC Directory editing in tools gt options has been deprecated. codepre  pVisual C 2010 no longer supports this feature. Does anyone have a solution or can help me with thisp  pLong story short I cannot include winsock.h, winsock2.h, or windows.h using the Visual C 2010 compiler.p  pAll help is appreciated. p

Negative 865 pIve got a class with a collections of Foos well call Bar.  Foo has a number of numberreturning methods that we want to aggregate at the Bar level, like sop  precode  def attribute1inputs Map[Int, Double]   foos.foldLeft0dsum, foo gt sum  foo.attribute1inputsfoo.id codepre  pTo aggregate these various attributes, I can have n functions of the formp  precode  def attributeNinputs Map[Int, Double]   foos.foldLeft0dsum, foo gt sum  foo.attributeNinputsfoo.id codepre  pHowever, thats ugly  I hate the fact that the iteration and summation are repeated.  I want to abstract that, so I can do something likep  precodedef attribute1inputs Map[Int, Double]  aggregateFoo.attribute1, inputs private def aggregatef Double gt Double  foos.foldLeft0dsum, foo gt sum  foo.finputsfoo.id codepre  pOf course, that does not work as one cannot reference Foo.attribute1 as a function  . is not a function instance.p  pIve basically stumbled through various solution, but every one results in code for each aggregation method at least as verbose or complex as what we have with no helper, and Im left with the duplication of the iteration.p  pI may be just hoping for too much here, but I am virtually certain there is an elegant way to do this is Scala that is escaping me.

Negative 865 pI am trying to create a program that functions similar to a task manager along with many other capabilities. Currently, I am having trouble finding all the toplevel windows with my current enumeration function. For some reason, it enumerates and fills out the HWND for some applications properly  e.g. Google Chrome, Command Prompt, CodeBlocks , but not for some games e.g. Roblox  only one I tested  . I tried to see if maybe FindWindow would fail too, but it worked fine in that context. Which means that EnumWindows should obviously find it, but apparently I either did something wrong or I read something wrong in the documentation. I really dont want to have to use FindWindow  when I probably wont know the title of most windows anyways.p  pstrongEnumeration function strongp  precodeBOOL CALLBACK FindWindows HWND handle, LPARAM

Now i want to escape from the maze. Start point is Cell[0,0] and the goal is at the last Cell, lets say Cell[30,30]. Here is my attempt for that.

Negative 865 pThe problem Im having is the followingp  pI have an app with two separate modes A WebView for browsing and a custom Canvas. The custom Canvas captures handwriting samples for language placement exams. Heres how it works. A user logs in to Moodle via the WebView. After they log in, they navigate to a Quiz inside Moodle. They click a link on one of the Quizs questions and this launches an Intent which hides the WebView and shows the Canvas. The user then writes using a stylus on the Canvas. When a user is finished writing their essay or whatever, they press a button that uploads an image file to Moodle. I am able to upload images to a point, its getting them to show up in the HTML page that the user clicked the link in originally see above and to get Moodle to commit them to permanent storage that is the problem. Normally this is all accomplished through AJAX really AJAJ since its JavaScript and JSON and when the user drops a file on this one component, the component refreshes and uploads the file. p  pHere is the problem I need the WebView so that students can log in to Moodle through Shibboleth. But because the underlying JavaScript in the browser makes AJAX calls to the Moodle server and since the Java side of Android doesnt have access to the DOM, I have use the Apache HTTP components library to make some of the connections below basically to preserve the state of the HTML page in WebView.p  pIn a desktop browser on, say, Windows, I use WebScarab to monitor the browsers requests and this is what I see the browser uploads a file to Moodle via five successive calls to the following scriptsp  ol liPOST https[moodle website]repositoryrepositoryajax.php [posts multipart form data]li liPOST https[moodle website]repositorydraftfilesajax.php [posts some params]li liGET https[moodle website]draftfile.php[someid]userdraft[someid][somefilename.png] [returns an icon of the image for a filepicker from YUI]li liPOST https[moodle website]modquizprocessattempt.php [returns HTML page]li liGET https[moodle website]modquizsummary.php [returns HTML page]li ol  pSome of these scripts return, as youd expect, JSON data since theyre AJAX and not HTML. The final two calls 4 amp 5 return HTML. Now, I can make all of those calls in succession in either the WebView or the Apache HTTP library, but if I do so with WebView, only JSON data is returned to the WebView in calls 13 WebView treats the JSON data as a page and displays it wiping out whatever HTML page was displayed in it. If I capture and process the JSON data using the Apache HTTP library in Java, then the JavaScript components internal to the page do not get updated. If I split the calls so that I send only calls 4 amp 5 to the WebView, the HTML merely returns WebView to the first question of the exam and Moodle acts as if I havent uploaded anything.p  pI can verify that files are uploading if I manually refresh press a link the JavaScript UI elements in the page. I cant expect students to do this, though, because the link to do so is very tiny and its not obvious that it does a refresh. I need a way to programmatically refresh this one element its part of YUI or to get Android and the Java side to play more nicely with the JavaScriptDOM side. p  pMy question is does anyone know a way to 1 fire off a drag and drop event using YUI to an element inside an HTML page or 2 a way to consume the JSON data and pass it to an element inside the HTML page.p  pIm banging my head against a wall trying to figure this out.p  hr  pOK, so I figured out that codejavascriptdocument.getElementsByClassName[name of link here][0].clickcode works in Chrome on the desktop but doesnt work if I pass it to WebView.loadURL. I just need to be able to simulate that click event reliably in WebView. It appears not to support codeclickcode. Anyone have any ideasp

I need to make a jQuery function that lights up a star that is clicked and all the previous stars. My objects are defined only by the class newsItem, no ids.  A friend of mine did it with the following code, but he used ids for his objects and had to copy the code for each object with a different idp  precodeslider.onclick, box1 .ButtonMore, function      var stars  mainContainer slider box1 .star .cl .stars .ButtonMore     var x stars.indexthis      for var n  0 n lt stars.length n         stars[n].removeClassactive      for var n  0 n lt x  n         stars[n].addClassactive  codepre  pIve tried to modify this code to use with just the class, but no luck.

Im guessing thats because Im using just classes and not ids. Is there any way to do this without ids, cause I dont want to clutter up my .js file and this knowledge would really come in handy in the future. Its schoolwork so I need to do it like this.p

It holds the following boolean propertiesbr IsMono  strongtruestrong if mono system strongfalsestrong if stereobr IsLeft  Relevant for stereo onlybr Also, there are 3 integer properties RightLevel, LeftLevel and MonoLevelp  pThe V will look like this for Stereobr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnuWPW.jpg altenter image description herep  pNow, If the system is Mono then the Audio Channel frame box should not be displayed and the Audio Level frame box should display a single row, labeled Mono. The source of the level meter will be MonoLevel.br The logic seems to be straightforward, but where do I implement it I need to bind the IsVisible of frame box Audio Channel and other controls to not IsMono, to bind the mono level meter to IsMono. There are other simple logic that I need to add such as correct labeling and icon.  p  pShould I use Convertors as my main tool Are convertors considered to be a part of the View V or the VM Should I create in XAML a separate view for Mono and Stereo and just make the selected one visible Is it a good idea to extend the VM to include IsStereo which is nothing but NOT IsMono and other redundancies to simplify the XAMLp

Negative 865 pThis is a question of concept, and I am just moving from MS Access to SQL Server for stability and scalability.p  pI need to maintain a database that pulls from another server daily.  Due to the possibility and probability of record changes on the other server, I have to pull using a 10 day rolling window with the expectation that anything older than 10 days will not change by policy.p  pThe pull is in stages, getting just the records within a date range on the initial pass, then moving to other tables one at a time to pull relevant and relation data.p  pI have written a script that works with date range variables.  If I set the range to 10 days, it pulls everything in about 8 hours.  In a test to see if looping might be better, having the script loop starting with today 10, then continue until the while lt today, it takes 16 hours to do 3 days.p  pBeing new, I am curious of the logical reason why the looping by date approach is so much slower.  My thought was to try to mitigate impact on the other server, but maybe this isnt conceptually the case.p  pThe code works perfectly in both cases with the only difference being looped or all at once.p  pThanks for any insight on thisp

Negative 865 pMy first post here, I have always found the help I needed in previously asked questions ,thanks, but Im stumped this time so here goes.p  pIm still a novice relatively speaking to people on here, but I have developed a joomla 2.5 component and I need to store data in AES encrypted format. Ok so for saving the data, Ive done this by overriding the prepareTable function in the model when saving the data, and that works very well.p  pBut where is the best place to decrypt the data when loading it back into the user formsp  pFor the list views I can just call my own decrypt function in the view or even the layout and thats ok too.p  pBut when I go to actually edit an individual record, using the standard joomla myform.xml the data is loaded into the formfields unencrypted.p  pI need to override some built in part of Joomla so that I can decrypt the data before it is populated into the form fields. Can anyone please advise what function I can override to change the data before it is displayed in the form. Maybe Ive missed something obvious but what I am looking for is the same as prepareTable but for loading data, rather than saving it.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 865 pI have started using libgdx and have been trying to get the freetypefont working on Android but no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to get it working.  My app was working perfectly fine until I tried using freetypefont.  I have put the extensions in as directed on the libgdx web site.  The app crashes or stops working as soon as it starts.  p  pThe console says couldnt load shared library gdxfreetype for target linux 32bit.  I feel like I have tried everything.  I have put the two freetype and freetype native files into the main game libs, I have put them into the desktop and only put the freetype one into the android lib.  I have used the latest nightly build .so files for the armeabi folders and still nothing.  I have also included the nightly build .so file for the x86 folder as suggested on here and still nothing.

Negative 865 pI am working with an OpenGL client code that only uses the default texture unit GLTEXTURE0. It never creates a texture so its always referring to the default texture name 0. As the drawing commands are issued, if a new texture is needed, it is created on the fly  either GLTEXTURE1D or GLTEXTURE2D.p  pMy understanding is that both 1D and 2D textures will refer to the same unit  0. Depending on which texture is being used  1D or 2D  I pass a uniform flag to the shader so it knows how to work on the texture.p  pI also define a sampler1D AND a sampler2D in my fragment shader. I assign unit 0 to both  at least, thats my understanding of what I should do.p  pIn the fragment shader I use the codep  precode  uniform sampler1D texture1   uniform sampler2D texture2   uniform int texflagf   void main     iftexflagf  1          glFragColor  texture1Dtexture1, glTexCoord[0].s   else iftexflagf  2          glFragColor  texture2Dtexture2, glTexCoord[0].st   else      glFragColor  glColor      codepre  pwhere texflagf takes values 0, 1, and 2, depending on whether Im drawing without textures, with a 1D texture, or with a 2D texture. Note that in both I use glTexCoord[0], as only one unit is active. The vertex shader just passes these TexCoords throughp  precodeglTexCoord[0]  glMultiTexCoord0 codepre  p1 What I see is that if I first draw a 1D texture, the 2D texture doesnt display and viceversa. Whyp  p2 The client code assigns the unit via the codep  precode     tex1Dloc  glGetUniformLocationprog,texture1      glUniform1i tex1Dloc,0      tex2Dloc  glGetUniformLocationprog,texture2      glUniform1i tex2Dloc,0 codepre  pThis shows Im setting the unit to both 1D and 2D texture to 0.p  pIf I now set tex2Dloc to unit 1  even though there is no reference to GLTEXTURE1 in the entire code  this seems to work. But I never even pass the texture coordinates for unit 1 in the vertex shader and still access glTexCoord[0] in both sampler1D and sampler2D.p  pI do not understand why setting one of the samplers to a different nonexistent unit works.p  pCan somebody explain to me whats going on herep  pThanks.p

Negative 865 pI installed the Typescript extension for VS.NET 2013. I had the web development components installed and I can write typescript code, it builds to a single JS file. It works great.p  pHowever, it seems like the project is setup to build a binMyProjectName.dll file. Theres even an option to target a specific version of the .NET framework within the Typescript project. My question is why Isnt Typescript supposed to be only for compiling to JS and thats it. What can I do with this DLL filep
Negative 865 pWe need to create or integrate some existing software which identifies the FTP folder to download files.  The problem here is the folder structure will be configured by the user according to how the client stores them on FTP at run time and stored in some xml or DB. p  pThe folder structure needs to be generic so that we can easily configure it for any type of structure. The folder or file names can contain dates or part of date in their names which change everyday according to the date. p  pFor eg. we can have a folder FilesDDMMYYYY and inside that there will be specific files which have to be downloaded everyday.  OR A single folder in which different files can contain dates.p

Negative 865 pI have a scenario where I get some data from two sources over the web. The data comes in chunks and are continuously arriving until I end my program. The data from the two sources are stored in two codeListltTgtcodes. codeTcode is emdifferentem for the two lists.p  pI then codeJoincode the two lists on some parameter into a emthirdem type, and after joining then, I would like to look in each lists for data that was not possible to join.p  pThe sequence isp  ol liAccumulate data in listsli liJoin listsli liClear listsli liPut unjoinable data in listsli liRepeatli ol  pSo far I have a pretty nice linq query centered around a codeJoincode, and it works nicely. But when I come to checking if the two lists contain data that was not able to be joined, I have a linq query which essentially iterates through all three lists looking. This is a bit silly and kind of slow, so I was wondering if there is a nice way of joining data in linq while also creating a list of unjoinable data from the two lists.p

Negative 865 pI have a multithreaded program that does heavy memory allocation. The performance is fine on a quadcore i7 CPU and the speed up is around 3.9X. But, when the program is executed on a 12core Xeon CPU, the speedup value does not go beyond 5.5X.p  pI should mention that the GC seems not to be a problem because VisualGC reports below 1 seconds for GC after more than 100 seconds of execution. The main memory usage belongs to the Eden section of heap and other sections hardly get used. The code does massive int array allocations and performs some arithmetic operations on them. It is somehow like statespace exploring and allocation of new instances cannot be avoided.p  pAs you know, the standard memory allocators of both Windows and Linux show unsatisfactory performance for multithreaded programs and good alternatives like tcmalloc and Hoard are available for CC. Since the parallel section consists of fully independent tasks and the GC time is very low, I doubted that the main reason should be the bad performance of JVMs memory allocator when too many threads compete for allocation.p  pDoes anybody have experience with JVMs allocator in massive multithreaded programs and can give advise on how I can overcome this problemp  pP.S. I have tested the code using JVM 6,7, and 8. The allocation rate is also very high around 10 millions per second but as I mentioned the Eden section is heavily used and the working set is less than a Gigabyte.p

Negative 865 pI have eleven tables.p  pCall one of them the Parent table, and the other ten are Child tables, perhaps ChildA, ChildB, etc through ChildJp  pConsider the Parent table to be abstracting a piece of electronics. Every piece of electronics has some common columns, like a name, but each different type of electronic device has widely differing properties. The columns needed to represent a TV are greatly different than, say, a cell phone.p  pThe parent may have one and only one child that exists in one of the Child tables, but will not be associated with more than one.p  pErgo, if Parent has a ChildA, it wont have a ChildB through ChildJ.p  pThe way that I have currently implemented this is through one ChildType column, one ChildId field, and ten persisted computed columns.p  pFor example, I assign arbitrarily the value 1 for the ChildType of ChildA, 2 for ChildB, etc. there is a CHECK constraint on ChildTypep  pI then create persisted columns using CASE to give the Parent table a ChildAId, ChildBId, etc by using the Type column.  p  pthat is, p  precodeChildAId AS CASE WHEN ChildType1 THEN ItemId END PERSISTED, ChildBId AS CASE WHEN ChildType2 THEN ItemId END PERSISTED, codepre  p.... etcp  pThese computed columns are persisted, as I need to use them in codeFOREIGN KEYcode constraints.p  pThe contents of the various Child tables are so different as to be completely unrelated to one another.p  pIn this way, I have effectively managed to represent a variant type in SQLp  pOther ideas I had considered, and why I rejected themp  ol lipUse the Id of the Parent table in the ChildX tables.

It is a beautiful thing really, and one of the main reasons I picked what I picked.p  pIs there a more standardized way that data of this type basically a variant gets represented in SQL in a way that is controlled through constraints and allows me to query it and consume it with things like entity framework  Is the addition of many fields all but one of which will always be NULL the tradeoff cost of how Im doing this  Am I not seeing a red flag that I should be seeingp

I tried thisp  precodereturn myList.MaxdelegateRegion r  if r.EligibleForExpansion return r.Size else return 1  codepre  pHowever, that returns the Size value of the largest region, not the largest Region itself which is what I need.p  pI know that my foreach code will return null if no Region meets the requirement while the Max code will give 1 or any Region that doesnt meet the requirement I can deal with either way.p  pI dont think I can just make Region IComparable, though I have many searches for Region objects, and I need to sort by different parameters at different times, so the comparison function would be different in different searches.p  pI could just wrap my foreach code in a static function and call that wherever I need to search, but it seems like there should be a more elegant way to do this in C.p

Negative 865 pI have set up a DoSFilter for my webapp and have deployed it in Jetty. Things works nicely. However I occasionally want to change the Filter configuration. To do that I always have to change the web.xml and redeploy the webapps which is rather inconvenient. I would want to do this dynamically instead. p  pI learned that I can configure QoSFilter and DoSFilter using JMX since they are exposed as MBeans inside Jetty.

Negative 865 pOK usually Im pretty good at googling around and using debug.print to isolate and solve the problem but this one is escaping me. p  pThe purpose of this code is to create a new record in a table, using a form in which a person has selected a team members name from a dropdown and a project phase from a dropdown and then input a number of hours into a textbox, then clicked a button that says Add.

I tried to check the SavedInstanceState in OnCreateView but if I only apply the listener when it is not null, rotating the device removes the listener completely.p  pstrongActivity onCreatestrongp  precodeOverride protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      setContentViewR.layout.activityviewpub      Intent intent  getIntent      pubname  intent.getStringExtraMainActivity.PUB      setTitlepubname      final ActionBar actionBar  getActionBar     actionBar.setNavigationModeActionBar.NAVIGATIONMODETABS      mSectionsPagerAdapter  new SectionsPagerAdaptergetFragmentManager      mViewPager  ViewPager findViewByIdR.id.pager     mViewPager.setAdaptermSectionsPagerAdapter      mViewPager.setOnPageChangeListenernew ViewPager.SimpleOnPageChangeListener              Override             public void onPageSelectedint position                  actionBar.setSelectedNavigationItemposition                             For each of the sections in the app, add a tab to the action bar.     for int i  0 i lt mSectionsPagerAdapter.getCount i          actionBar.addTabactionBar.newTab                 .setTextmSectionsPagerAdapter.getPageTitlei                 .setTabListenerthis           actionBar.setSelectedNavigationItem1  codepre  pstrongFragmentPAgerAdapter Classstrongp  precodepublic class SectionsPagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter       public SectionsPagerAdapterFragmentManager fm          superfm           Override     public Fragment getItemint position          switch position              case 0                 return DirectionsFragment.newInstanceposition  1             case 1                 return DetailsFragment.newInstanceposition  1             case 2                 return RelationsFragment.newInstanceposition  1                  return null                       Override     public int getCount          return 3           Override     public CharSequence getPageTitleint position          switch position              case 0                 return getStringR.string.titlesection1             case 1                 return getStringR.string.titlesection2             case 2                 return getStringR.string.titlesection3                  return null       codepre  pstrongDetailsFragment Classstrongp  precodepublic static class DetailsFragment extends Fragment       private static final String ARGSECTIONNUMBER  sectionnumber      public static DetailsFragment newInstanceint sectionNumber          DetailsFragment fragment  new DetailsFragment         Bundle args  new Bundle         args.putIntARGSECTIONNUMBER, sectionNumber         fragment.setArgumentsargs         return fragment           Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setRetainInstancetrue           Override     public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreateViewinflater, container, savedInstanceState          View rootView  inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentpubdetails, container, false         RatingBar ratingBar  RatingBarrootView.findViewByIdR.id.rating         ratingBar.setOnRatingBarChangeListenernew OnRatingBarChangeListener             public void onRatingChangedRatingBar ratingBar, float rating, boolean fromUser                   Toast.makeTextratingBar.getContext,Your Selected Ratings     String.valueOfrating,Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                                return rootView        codepre  pWhat obvious trick have I missedp

Negative 865 pI am working with Local Binary Patterns LBP which produce numbers in the range 0255.  That means that they can fit in a byte 256 different values may be included into a byte. So that explains why many if not all implementation in java I have found uses codebyte[]code to store these values.p  pThe problem is that since I am interested in the rank of these values when converted to codebytecode from codeintcode for example they do not keep the previous rank they had as codeintcode for example since byte are signed as all but chars in java I think and so the greater 128 values 127 and after of the range 0255 becomes negative numbers. Furthermore I think they are inverted in order the negative ones. p  pSome examples to be more specificp  precodeint 0  byte 0 int 20  byte 20 int 40  byte 40 int 60  byte 60 int 80  byte 80 int 100  byte 100 int 120  byte 120 int 140  byte 116 int 160  byte 96 int 180  byte 76 int 200  byte 56 int 220  byte 36 int 240  byte 16 codepre  pMy question is whether there is a specific way to maintain the order of codeintcode values when converted to codebytecode meaning code240 gt 60code should hold true in codebytecode also code16 lt 60code while keeping memory needs minimum meaning use only 8bits if that many are required. I know I could consider comparing the byte in a more complex way for example every negative  positive and if both codebytecodes are negative inverse the order but I think its not that satisfactory.p  pIs there any other way to convert to codebytecode besides codebyte icodep

Negative 865 pIm building a WordPress theme which I intend to make available for download, and I want developers to be able to make child themes for it. I would like to use Modernizr in it, but not an entire Modernizr build with every bell and whistle. Just a barebones build for the features I need, but also with support for child theme builders who want to add more Modernizr features. Is there a way to do that I know Modernizr has an addTest function, but I dont know if this would cover all bases if I add it in to my Modernizr build.p

Negative 865 pI have developed an iOS app using codeCocos3dcode framework. It has an Application Home screencodeView controllercode with the button called Scan. When I click on this button, I launch device camera screen to Scan Track an Image using codeQualcomm Vuforia Augmented Reality sourcescode, and once scan is done for an respective image, Ill be taking to Main Scene of the Cocos3d scene. I have a Back button in Cocos3d main scene. Clicking on this Back will take us back again to App Home screen. Clicking again Scan tries to launch camera for Augmented scanning, but it crashes continuously with this errorp  pThe execution here is, codeQualcomm Vuforia Augcode. reality source also uses EAGL view with EAGLContext, etc. related stuff.p  pCocos3d already uses EAGLView and other related files.p  pI dont launch Cocos3d scene every time freshly Because I loadextract lot of images, models. I launch it first time freshly loading all the imagesmodels once and then onwards I use the same scene for launching the main scene when we are coming back second time from App home screen. This way, I dont need to loadextract huge files at run time all the times and also reduce time consuming for launching the same scene.p  pI would like to know, what would it be clashed when I launch the camera second time for scanning aug. reality  Is it due to opening eagl view twice, one has already opened by Cocos3d scene and left open, but qualcomm tries to open every time freshly  Or Could someone please help to solve this, as this is not able to get any clue to fix for long time p  pI have shared the entire project in this link, a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BrB0I924QK7NUVibWVMSGgtaEkedituspsharing relnofollowhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BrB0I924QK7NUVibWVMSGgtaEkedituspsharingap  pErrorp  precodepushing CC3OpenGLES11MatrixStack GLPROJECTION.

Negative 865 pWith respect to Process lifecycle, Android system tries to maintain an application process for as long as possible, but eventually needs to remove old processes to reclaim memory for new or more important processes. To determine which processes to keep and which to kill, the system places each process into an importance hierarchy based on the components running in the process and the state of those components. Processes with the lowest importance are eliminated first, then those with the next lowest importance, and so on, as necessary to recover system resources. p  pOne of the classification is  p  pbForeground Process  bA process that is required for what the user is currently doing.

Is there another place I should be writing the filesp  pIve got no idea how to proceed here or if Im even on the right track so Id appreciate some help if you can. Thanksp

Negative 865 pLets assume we have an application that can be customized for some customers. The application is using Javabased spring configuration a.k.a. Java config for dependency injection.

When I do codeperson.petcode, the codePerson.petcode property getter is called resulting in an instance of codePetcode being generated.  I have codePetcode set up like a dictionary where data is accessed with codegetitemcode and codesetitemcode like codepet[age]code and the data is stored within in codePet.dictcode.  In my real data I have reasons for this  the class does other things besides hold a dictionary.  The conundrum is what happens when I do codeperson.pet[age]  10code  In this situation, a pet object is generated on the fly and its age item is set to code10code.  Thats it.  There is nothing in this logic to set the pet back to the person, which would call the codePerson.petcode property setter function and store the pets age in codePerson.petsagecode.p  pWhile this is the behavior which bit me, this is only the beginning.p  pThe reason this bit me is that a lot of my data was lists and I was modifying specific indexes of the lists.  codeThe Pet[dimensions]code item and codePet[resources]code both behave this way.  When codeperson.pet[dimensions][0]  7code is called, the pet object is generated from the codePerson.petcode property getter, the codegetitemcode method translates the codepet[dimensions]code call into codepet.dict[dimensions]code which returns the code[3, 4, 5]code list per the example code, and the code[0]code list index is used to change the list to code[7, 4, 5]code, oh man.... I just figured this whole thing out.  Ill explain in the Answer section.p  pSo the gist of the problem is that for individual numbers like age the changes to pet dont affect person, but for containers like lists and dicts, the changes happen to person as well.  I thought the only way the changes would propagate back is through the person.pet setter, but I confirmed that the setter is never getting called.p
Negative 865 pIm trying to automate a report that for a customer and Im a bit stuck with one of the hurdles that needs to overcome, I have some ideas but am new to VB programming. p  pThe requirement is to copy a range of cells from one sheet to another, but the destination needs to change depending on the current date. Using a general example Im trying to achieve the following p  pIf the date is the 1st of the month, the destination range is B2F3, if it is the 2nd then the destination range is B4F5, if the 3rd then destination is B6F7....... if the 31st then the destination is B62F63, the source ranges are static. p  pI figured I could probably achieve this by writing a huge script which contained an IF statement for each day of the month, but I was hoping I could be a bit smarter and use variables to assign the row references at the beginning of the script then just sub them back in to the select  copy statements. p  pRegards,  Jasonp

I have used JMS to achieve that.p  pOk, that being said, my class is working fine when Im deploying it in a simple stand alone weblogic server, but I also have a clustered environment in which I want to deploy my application. My clustered environment has two servers and one load balancer. When I deploy it in the cluster, it gets deployed successfully. But as soon as I run any service messages start getting piled up. I have done my research on this and every wensite says to restart the server, clear cache, make sure your data source name and jar file name are not same. I have done all that. The problem still exists. Here is the piece of code that I have added after which the messages are getting piled upp  precode    public static void createLogFileDAO db, Connection conn, String msgguid, String serviceNameDB,

Negative 865 pIm trying to replace Cartesian product produced by SQL by data.table call. I have large history with assets and values, and I need a subset of all combinations. Lets say that I have table a with T  [date, contract, value]. In SQL it looks likep  precodeSELECT a.date, a.contract, a.value, b.contract. b.value  FROM T a, T b WHERE a.date  b.date AND a.contract ltgt b.contract AND a.value  b.value lt 4 codepre  pIn R I have now the followingp  precodelibrarydata.table  n lt 1500 dt lt data.tabledate      repseqSys.Date  n1, Sys.Date, by  1 day, 3,                  contract  crepa, n, repb, n, repc, n,                  value     crep1, n, rep2, n, rep3, n setkeydt, date  dt[dt, allow.cartesian  TRUE][contract  i.contract amp value  i.value lt 4] codepre  pI believe that my solution creates all combinations first in this case 13,500 rows and then filter to 3000.

Negative 865 pIm currently trying to get two codeboostthreadcodes to get equal processing time on the CPU using a shared mutex called codemutexCOMcode. As it currently stands both threads are set to run infinitely. One thread The main thread simply prints out testing while the other thread, running the codeNavigationbegincode function, prints shared function, waits one second, then prints Shared function will now end.... The wait is meant to simulate the larger amount of processing necessary for the function that will replace this stub. Each iteration of the infinite loops is preceded within the loop by a scoped lock on codemutexCOMcode. The expected output should be something like the following ad infinitump  precodetesting shared function Shared function will now end... testing shared function Shared function will now end... codepre  pUnfortunately, something Ive done causes the output instead to bep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9DzSd.png altThread staggeringp  pp  pIt seems that the iterations are being grouped together instead of being interlaced like I would expect. If anyone can explain whats going on here I would be very appreciative, as it seems that my understanding of thread management using mutexes could use some work.p  pMy only theory is that my assumption that boost handles queuing for locking the mutex is wrong and that I need to somehow create my own queue to give the threads fair access to avoid starvation. However, Im doubtful about this because it would basically render the point of mutexes moot as I would still need to handle all of the management on my own. At that point why not just use a semaphorep  pMy code is as follows. Only relevant code is included, so dont worry about the missing class structure.

Negative 865 pIm developing a system of many processes which have to be aware of many configurations, options and data of the system. For doing that, I implement a shared object that use a pointer to a shared memory block of parameters and their data. The data of the parameters are the types, the values, default values, functions for getset and etc. Basically the data is in a kind of lookup table. This shared object has some functions for getset these parameters, so all the processes in the system can getset these many parameters. I have many defines for the parameters codes and many possibilities for each parameter, for example, one code can be a float value, and another is an array of ints. You can only imagine the complexity of the code with all the switch and cases..p  pMy questions arep  pDoes this practice is correct for handling a systemwide parameters and configurations for speed and efficiency I dont want to use a DB file, I have to keep the data close in the RAM. I thought about moving the lookup table inmemory DB but the processing time is critical and I dont want to waste time on building SQL statements and compiling them. Any ideas of what is the best way to do itp

How can I move the codeListFragmentcode down so that only the first row is visible at the bottom of the screen with the other two rows below it off the screenp  pMy MapActivity is the main codeActivitycode p  precodeimport android.app.Activity import android.app.Fragment import android.app.FragmentTransaction import android.os.Bundle import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup  public class MapActivity extends Activity       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState          setContentViewR.layout.activitymap            public static class PlaceholderFragment extends Fragment           public PlaceholderFragment                    Override         public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,                                  Bundle savedInstanceState              return inflater.inflateR.layout.fragmentmap, container, false                     Define the onShowTimesButtonClick listener     public void onShowTimesButtonClickView view           Instantiate timeListFragment         TimeListFragment timeListFragment  new TimeListFragment          FragmentTransaction transaction  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction         transaction.addR.id.container, timeListFragment, timeList         transaction.commit       codepre  pThe layout of the MapActivityp  precodeltFrameLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidididcontainer     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     toolscontext.MapActivity     toolsignoreMergeRootFrame     androidclickabletrue     androidfocusablefalse     androidfocusableInTouchModefalsegt      ltSearchView         androidlayoutwidth300dp         androidlayoutheight50dp         androidididsearchBar         androidlayoutgravitystarttop         androidlayoutmarginTop20dp         androidlayoutmarginLeft20dp         androidlayoutmarginStart20dp         androidbackground656565         androidclickabletrue         androidfocusabletrue         androidfocusableInTouchModetrue         androidinputTypetext gt      ltButton         androidididtimesButton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheight50dp         androidlayoutgravitytopcenter         androidlayoutmarginTop90dp         androidtextstringtimesbutton         androidonClickonShowTimesButtonClickgt  ltFrameLayoutgt codepre  pTimeListFragment is my custom codeListFragmentcode.p  precodeimport android.app.ListFragment import android.os.Bundle import android.app.Fragment import android.view.Gravity import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.FrameLayout.LayoutParams     A simple link Fragment subclass.   public class TimeListFragment extends ListFragment       public TimeListFragment           Required empty public constructor           Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState           Temporary time data         String[] times  new String[]100, 030, 045           Load the time data         setListAdapternew TimesListArrayAdaptergetActivity, R.layout.layouttimeslistrow, R.id.listText, times           Override     public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState          View view  inflater.inflateR.layout.layouttimeslist, container, false          LayoutParams layoutParams  new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT         layoutParams.gravity  Gravity.BOTTOM          container.setLayoutParamslayoutParams          return view       codepre  pThe layout for TimeListFragmentp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidpaddingLeft8dp     androidpaddingRight8dp     androidgravitybottomgt      ltListView androidid idandroidlist         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheight0dp         androidlayoutweight1         androiddrawSelectorOnTopfalsegt      ltTextView androidididandroidempty         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidtextNo datagt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre
Negative 865 pIm trying to create some kind of filtering system for my data with mongodb using just the query string.

Negative 865 pI have a custom linux prompt which displays various useful nuggets of information.  As I use SVN in my daily job I thought it would be nice to further customize my prompt with information as to the current workspace URL.  This was mostly prompted by a recent case where I had switched to a branch then forgot I had done so.  Confusion abounded so, in a bid to avoid this happening again, I thought this seemed like a good idea.p  pThis has already been achieved by others so I could just follow their examples but I also like to work things out from basic principles.  One thing that I observed about other peoples solutions was that they tended to execute svn info with no regard to context.  Not a problem in and of itself but I thought it might be nice to test for the presence of the ubiquitous .svn directory before invoking svn info.p  pI arrived at this partial solutionp  precodeif [ d ..svn ]  then svn info  sed n e URL s.svnp  fi codepre  pIn the presence of a .svn directory I invoke svn info then use sed to spit out the portion of the URL in which I am interested.p  pThe problem comes however from the fact that, since svn 1.7, .svn is not ubiquitousp  pI had thought that I might replace the test for the directory with a call to find to perform a reverse directory search to search up the directory tree ... except there doesnt appear to be such an ability.p  pOther than dropping the test for .svn entirely, can anybody suggest how I might test for the presence of said folder in the current location and all parent foldersp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 865 pI am not sure how to go about coding this. So, I have a string called S and a pattern string called M. I want to delete all occurrences of M in S. But, when I delete one occurrence of M in S, I could possibly create another. For example, given the word aajjk and the pattern aj. After the first deletion, it would become ajk. In this new string, another occurrence of aj has come after the first deletion. The final string after all deletions would then be k. Could you give me some tips on how to approach this problem, some psuedocode would be helpful as I need practice in implementation. p

Negative 865 pThe normal way to implement custom subitem draw in listview is to handle the NMCUSTOMDRAW notification in the parent class, and do the drawing there. p  pHowever I am writing a reusable listview derived window class and would like to avoid having to force the users to reflect the notifications to the instantiated windows everywhere they are used.p  pI know of two alternative ways of doing this, but both have drawbacksp  p1 Register two custom window classes, one which is derived from the listview and one which is what is used by whatever instantiates my class. The second class just creates the custom listview as a child window to intercept all notifications, and then either reflects these or forwards them to its parent.  Drawbacks are I also need to forward all external messages that are sent to the outer control to the inner control, or expose the inner control via a custom window message Similar to how the header control in the listview may be accessed. All notifications must also be forwarded up to its parent.p  p2 The control could subclass its parent window and intercept WMNOTIFY messages at that stage. Drawbacks This is a bad idea, and also a very brittle way of doing things.p  pAlternatively 3. Continue to require notification reflection. p  pIs there a better way of being notified about the custom draw short of doing full custom draw, or is there someway of doing full custom draw and triggering default drawing first and then painting the contents of the columns which display custom data afterwardsp

Negative 865 blockquote   pLemma 1 we know at any table with a mixture of lefthanded and righthanded   philosophers, deadlock cannot occur. I very familiar with it proofs.p blockquote  pI ran into a following question on Interview recently. p  pThere are 5 philosophers sitting at a round table. between each two philosophers there is a chopsticks. each philosophers need two chopsticks to eat. we have two type of philosophers lefthanded and righthanded. lefthanded first take a chopsticks with left hands. righthanded first take a chopsticks with right hands. suppose among 5 philosophers there is at least 1 lefthanded and at least 1 righthanded. which of them is Truep  blockquote   pa independent from the combination of placement philosophers at round   table, there is no deadlock. I sure Truep      pb if all of the philosophers simultaneously take the first    chopsticks, there is a deadlock.  I thin this is true because in   implication if we have ab and a is false ab is true., and in   this option there is no way to all philosopher simultaneously take the   first  chopsticks, so the whole statement is true.p blockquote  pAny expert could help me, that I argument is True p  blockquote   pEdit 1 I add the proof for Lemma1 but the question mentioned above   has some differences.  p      pFirst observe that due to the pattern of resource acquisition around   the table there is only one possible waitcycle, i.e., the cycle   involving all philosophers. So assume such a deadlock. Every   philosopher must be waiting, by which we mean waiting for a chopstock   held by another. Thus all chopsticks must be held. If our table has a   mixture of lefthanded and righthanded philosophers, there must be at   least one pair of adjacent philosophers of opposite handedness. First   assume a lefthanded philosopher Lenny seated to the left of a   righthanded philosopher Roger. Because all chopsticks must be   held, either Lenny or Roger must hold the chopstick which is between   them. If Lenny holds it, that is his right chopstick, so he must   previously have acquired the chopstick to his left. Thus Lenny holds   two chopsticks, and is not waiting to acquire any he is eating, so   there is not a deadlock. If Roger holds the chopstick which is between   them, that is his left chopstick, so he must previously have   acquired the chopstock to his right, etc. If we call the previous case   the outward reaching case, then the inward reaching case is a   righthanded philosopher seated to the left of a lefthanded   philosopher. Again, if we have a deadlock, all chopsticks must be   held, so one of them holds the chopstick between them. This means that   the other one holds no chopsticks, since the one between them is the   rst one each will try to acquire either Roger reached right and got   it, or Lenny reached left and got it the other is waiting for it   before reaching in the outward direction. If there are n philosphers   and n chopsticks, all chopsticks held, but one philosopher holds zero   chopsticks, then n1 philosophers hold n chopsticks. Some philospher   must hold two chopsticks that philosopher is not waiting he is   eating, so there is no deadlock.p blockquote

Negative 865 pI am looking to work about 4000 fixedsize 3x3, 4x4 matrices, doing things such as matrix inversion and eigendecomposition.p  pIt seems to me the best way to parallelize this would be to let each of the many GPU threads work on a single instance of the problem.p  pIs there a reasonable way to do this I have read a hrefhttpwww.culatools.comblog20111209batchedoperations relnofollowhttpwww.culatools.comblog20111209batchedoperationsa but as far as I can tell, its always something that is being worked on with no solution in sight. Three years later, I hope there is a good solution.p  pSo far, I have looked atp  ul liUsing Eigen in CUDA kernels a hrefhttpeigen.tuxfamily.orgdoxdevelTopicCUDA.html relnofollowhttpeigen.tuxfamily.orgdoxdevelTopicCUDA.htmla. But this is in its infancy thus, it doesnt seem to work well and some things are not implemented. Moreover, I am not sure if it is optimized for CUDA at all. There is almost no documentation and the only example of code is a test file eigentestcudabasic.cu. When I tried using Eigen in CUDA kernels, simple things like declaring an codeEigenMatrixXfcode in a kernel did not survive compilation with codenvcc V7.0.27code and Eigen 3.2.90 mercurial.li liUsing the cuBLAS device API library to run BLAS routines within a kernel. It seems cuBLAS and its ilk are written to be parallelized even for small matrices, which seems overkill and likely slow for the 3x3 and 4x4 matrices I am interested in. Also, Im not sure if there is anything like cuBLAS that can also do eigendecomposition or SVD. As far as I know, CULA does not support calling its routines from within kernels.li liBatch processing kernels using CUDA streams. In Section 2.1.7 Batching Kernels of the cuBLAS documentation for the CUDA Toolkit v7.0, this is suggested. But in practice it is not possible to have more than 16 concurrent kernels executing at the same time and consequently it would be terrible for processing 4000 small matrices. In an aforementioned link to the CULA blog post, I quote, One could, in theory, use a CUDA stream per problem and launch one problem at a time. This would be illperforming for two reasons. First is that the number of threads per block would be far too low [...] Second is that the overhead incurred by launching thousands of operations in this manner would be unacceptable, because the launch code is as expensive if not more expensive as just performing the matrix on the CPU.li liImplementing my own matrix multiplication and eigendecomposition in kernels. This is likely to be very slow, and may in addition be time consuming to implement.li ul  pAt this point I am tempted to give up on doing this on the GPU at all. It is a pity, since I was hoping for real time performance for an algorithm that requires inverting 4000 3x3 matrices about 100 times every 0.1 seconds.p

Negative 865 pI am using plyplus to design a simple grammar and I have been struggling with some weird error for a while. Please bear in mind I am a newbie.

I noticed that if I change the grammar and the input from codetabcode to codetacode, I get the same exception every time I run the code. Also, if I change it to codetabbcode, the error is gone.p  pThe error suggests that codetabcode is parsed as a WORD instead of a spacemarker. However, codetabbcode is also a WORD.

Negative 865 pIve been trying to detect the excel process in my installshield installer. I have a custom action that runs after appsearch and pops a window if it finds the process and displays a warning to the user. p  pI have tried using some old examples I found on installsite.org and using the findWindow call.

Nothing seems to detect the window. I used Spy and it reported that the window is named after the name of the currently opened notebook which complicates things since I have no way of knowing what a user could have opened.p  pI am open to suggestions here. The only requirement for this solution is that it has to be able to run as either a custom action or part of an install condition from within Installshield. p

The problem is that my image data can contain zeros. Matlab automatically turns the char member into a char array, stopping at the first 0 it encounters. This means my image data gets truncated. I however know how many values there are, this is returned in the imageSize member. How do I access the whole arrayp  pI have found one solution, changing the type of the codeimageBuffercode member in the proto file to codeuint8Ptrcode and then telling matlab what number of elements should be read from the pointerp  precodestr.imageBuffer.setdatatypestr.imageBuffer.DataType,1,str.imageSize codepre  pIs there a better solutionp

Negative 865 pIve got a 3x3 grid built with Zurbs Foundations framework and on load sometimes these boxes overlap each other.

Negative 865 pI have a fairly simple Web API 2.2 EF6 setup where I have Users and Preferences.  Users can have many Preferences, and Preferences can have many Users, so I have a join table called UserPreferences.

So, for example, if the PossibleValues of the Preference are Blue,Green,Red,White, the Value of the UserPreference might be Blue.  From the way I understand it, this type of relationship is manytomany, but since I have added another field to the join table Value, Entity Framework cant handle this as a manytomany.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7050404createcodefirstmanytomanywithadditionalfieldsinassociationtable70533937053393According to this questions answera, I have to create two onetomany relationships for this to work.

Negative 865 pI am attempting to get around having to raise the maxinputvars parameter when submitting a large form. My thought was to jsonify the form, create a second form with a single field in it, put the jsonified string into that single field, submit, decode as an array, and then replace the POST array with the decoded data. I am plugging this into an existing system so for this to work I would need the new array to have the same structure as the raw post would. However, I am running into an issue where regardless of how I encode the data I am losing info and structure beyond the first depth of the array. I have tried both using this library to encode the formp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.commacekjqueryserializeobject relnofollowhttpsgithub.commacekjqueryserializeobjectap  pAs well as jQueryform.serializeArray, each of which delivers results that decode in their own unintended ways.

Negative 865 pIs there a good way to make a grammar nonterminal which is parsed differently, depending on results of some boost phoenix functionp  pIn my usecase, I have a grammar which among other things includes CPPstyle define directives, and ifdef else endif directives. Its not actually the C preprocessor though its just some crude imitation made by someone else. When I parse it in qi, I pass my grammar in its ctor a reference to a preprocessor database object which is adapted to a fusion structure, and I have adapted phoenix functions which allow to add PP definitions  check for PP definitions. I have made it so that the define directives have a semantic action which registers new definitions.p  pWhen I try to implement the ifdef else directives Im not sure what I should do. The only way that I can think of to do this is to add a boolean flag to all of the attributes types of all of my grammar nonterminals that marks whether it is in a discarded ifdef branch, and after my AST is parsed then crawl through that again and toss the marked guys. But thats pretty inelegant, there has to be a better way, rightp  pIf possible I would like to be able to keep track of the original line numbers before ifdefs are resolved.p  pI hope the question is clear, if its not I can cook up a minimal example to show what Im trying to do but my actual grammar is large.p  pEdit Okay, I cooked up an SSCCEp  pSo here is a program that parses a very simple grammar of pairs, and has some minimal preprocessor language which includes define and ifdef. I understand how to use semantic actions so that matching things causes C callbacks to get fired, and that part seems to be working. However what I dont understand is how to use callbacks to feedback info into the grammar, i.e. if this phoenix function returns false then parse this differently. It would be enough I guess to know how to say if this phoenix function returns boolean false as part of this semantic action, then arbitrarily declare the nonterminal not to have matched and backtrack. Actually now that Im writing all this I guess I know that the mini XML example must somehow do this since it uses a local variable to enforce that start and close tags must match So I guess I could reverse engineer how it works there maybe. But apparently I didnt figure it out yet from reading docs  studying the examples.p  pNote that I think its different from your first suggestion, just make a skip grammar. The thing is that I dont know how to make the skip grammars behavior depend on a boost phoenix functions output either, its just the same problem again.

If I used the above code, it does not return a file, since the index of codefiles[2]code has nothing stored in it if two files were uploaded.p  pTo fix this, I used a loop within the for loop that will iterate through the length of codefilescode and print out each codefilecode contained in codefilescode.  But, since there are going to be multiple files, the current behavior is actually in the case of 2 files being uploaded, for example to parse each file strongtwicestrong.  I am parsing csv files with 1,000,000 rows which are later compared, so uploading twice is affecting performance.  p  blockquote   pIn short I am looking for a way to send each file to scope.parsePapafile, fileNumber, only once. p blockquote  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.  I am totally new to Angular, so apologies in advance if this is something simple I missed.p  hr  pEDIT danial solved the problem see below.  if anyone is interested, the final code looked like thisp  precodeapp.controllerFileUploadController, [scope, Upload, timeout, function scope, Upload, timeout  scope.watchfiles, function       scope.uploadscope.files   function uploadFilefile, index      Upload.upload         url httplocalhostReconcileindex.php,         file file          fileName i  to modify the name of the files     .progressfunction evt          var progressPercentage  parseInt100.0  evt.loaded  evt.total         scope.log  progressPercentage     .successfunction data, status, headers, config          scope.parsePapafile, index     .errorfunction data, status, headers, config          scope.log  error status   status        scope.upload  function files      scope.log       if files ampamp files.length          scope.numberOfFiles  files.length         for var i  0 i lt files.length i              var file  files[i]             if file ampamp file.error                  uploadFilefile, i                             codepre  p]p

Negative 865 pIm trying to create a nav menu where when you scroll to a section the selected navigation changes.

Essentially I need to access my nav.selected in the controller, but I seem to need to be outside of the controller in order to use window in jquery...p  pCould someone give me an explanation on how I may go about this Thank you.p

Negative 865 pIn my project, I am using Laravel purely as a backend api and all frontend is handled by Angular javascript. At the moment, the Laravel routes can be accessed directly and it will cough out all the data in Json that shows in the browser. I want to put a restriction on it so Laravel only responds to Ajax requests and nothing else.p  pI read this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16591787angularandlaravelherea which has a solution for Laravel 4 that is by adding a restriction in codefilter.phpcode.

Negative 865 pIve installed the jenkins.war in my Tomcat 8.p  pAfter installation I set that only registered users are allowed to create new jobs, but I have never created any user.

Negative 865 pIm trying to apply a function to a vector where for each new row the same function applies but a variable changes.

I would like the code to be able to read the file row by row so the end result is a vector that has done the above to each row. I think a loop would be neededp  pIm sure the solution is simple but I dont know how to do it.p

Negative 865 pSo I have an exercise that I should prove or disprove thatp  p1 if e is a minimum weight edge in the connected graph G such that not all edges are necessarily distinct, then every minimum spanning tree of G contains ep  p2 Same as 1 but now all edge weights are distinct.p  hr  pOk so intuitively, I understand that for 1 since not all edge weights are distinct, then its possible that a vertex has the path with edge e but also another edge e1 such that if weighte  weight e1 then there is a spanning tree which does not contain the edge e since the graph is connected. Otherwise if both e1 and e are in the minimum spanning tree, then there is a cycle p  pand for 2 since all edge weights are distinct, then of course the minimum spanning tree will contain the edge e since any algorithm will always choose the smaller path. p  pAny suggestions on how to prove these two though induction Not sure how to approach. p
