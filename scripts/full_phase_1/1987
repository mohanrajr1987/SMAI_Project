Positive 1987 pemT1em is the time taken to switch from user process process p1 to p2 while emT2em is time taken to switch from process p1 to kernel process  Now which will be more T1 or T2. For me it should be T1, my logic is, when the CPU is allocated to process p2 by removing p1 the kernel will have to first take control in its hands amp remove the PCB of p1 and load PCB of p2. While in case of p1 to kernel, it just have to give control to kernel. Am I rightWrong p
Positive 1987 pI know that some programmes like Java or .NET programmes use an extensive runtime system for execution. But I read something in a book about OS which isnt explained in more detail there that sounds like ANY programme written by a user runs in a runtime system and not directly on the operating system. p  pAn example given is that when you read a file, you dont call an operating system function for each bit you read, instead you read the bits or bytes into a buffer managed by the runtime system and when thats empty, you call a system function again.p  pSo does that mean that strictly speaking, any programme runs in a runtime environment of some kind except maybe prgrammes written in assembly...p
Positive 1987 pI am reading about operating systems. I read that when the OS starts, a command interpreter is started as a user process and that when you click in a GUI element, e.g. the desktop symbol of an application, the command to start that application is passed to this command interpreter.p  pI know command interpreters in the forms of shell or cmd.exe. So does this mean that on Windows when I double click on a desktop icon for, say, word, there is a command interpreter underneath that processes this command So clicking on the GUI elements equals writing a command in cmd.exep  pAnd under Windows, what is the name of that process as shown in process explorerp

Positive 1987 pWhen memory is low on an android device, the OS can and will begin to kill processes.  Processes not in use background services, and older processes are generally killed first.p  pIs this the only metric that the OS uses to kill processes though or does the OS also consider CPU or battery usage  For example, imagine a system that is not low in memory but is maxing out the cpu.  In this situation, will the OS begin killing processes  If so, will the OS begin to immediately kill processes or is there a delay  For example, if I was maxing out the CPU I would want the OS to kill background processes to free up the CPU but I would not want it to begin to kill foreground processes immediately.  Instead, I would want the OS to wait a period of time before killing more important processes.  I dont know the answers to these questions and I find them quite interesting.  Especially since whenever I read about how the OS handles app management usually only memory considerations are discussed.p

Positive 1987 pIm thinking of creating a gem that can return the type of terminal were currently running, be it codeUbuntucodes codegnome terminalcode or codeWindowcodes codeCommand Processorcode.

Remember, it has to work inp  ul liWindows 2000 or laterli liLinux 2.6li liFreeBSDli liSolaris 8li liHPUX 10li liOS X 10.4li liAIX 5.3li ul  pThe way Im thinking of doing it is pretty simple. First, I determine the os with this snippet of pure ruby codeRbConfigCONFIG[hostos]code Then, I utilize the a hrefhttpsgithub.comdjberg96sysproctable relnofollowsysproctable gema to get an array of all running processes. I then simply check if this array of processes contains a terminal program that is available for the detected OS. This wont be clever, Ill simply need to hardcode every available terminal for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, HPUX, OS X, AIX, but still doable. Its a finite list. And if someones terminal cannot be defined, it doesnt matter. Itll raise an error clearly explaining the problem and a link to the gems github project directory where they can add their terminal name its process name to the project. Anyway, my idea looks something like this pseudo codep  precodeproctable  SysProcTable.ps case RbConfigCONFIG[hostos] when i686linux     utilized  proctable amp [terminator,tilda,guake,gnometerminal,Yakuake,ROXTerm] when x64mingw32     utilized  proctable amp [windowscommandhost] when someothermadness ... end codepre  pNow, this should actually work for most cases, but there is one edge case that is bugging me strongWhat if they have two terminal programs running at the same time What if gnometerminal and ROXTerm, for example, are both installed and runningstrongp  pOur codeutilizedcode variable would look like this code[gnometerminal,ROXTerm]code. emHow do we pick which oneem Heres the question...do you have an ingenious way we can somehow manipulate the process in a certain way to identify which process is the terminal thats currently running the script Or something If this question gets nothing Ill just tell the user to simply quit the terminal theyre not using, but Id love this to be able to work automatically and I feel its so possible. The script has been executed from Terminal A, Terminal A and Terminal B are both running...so choose Terminal A Doesnt seem crazy.p  pAny ideas Remember, we are identifying the OS so OS specific hacks are acceptable.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32811782identifywhatterminalarubyscriptisrunninginRelatedap

Negative 1987 pIm still new to delegates and Ive been playing with the Delegatebased Data Access Layer described in Steven John Metskers Design Patterns in C book an excellent read. It defines the data access delegate like thisp  precodepublic delegate object BorrowReaderIDataReader reader codepre  pThe result of using this is code that looks like one of thesep  precodevar result  Foo.Barnew BorrowReaderDoFooBarMagic var result  Foo.BarDoFooBarMagic codepre  pHowever, since the delegates return type is object, you need to cast to get whatever the method DoFooBarMagic in this example really returns. So if DoFooBarMagic returns List, youd need to do something like thisp  precodevar result  Foo.BarDoFooBarMagic as Listltstringgt codepre  pWhat Id like is to be able to skip the cast and have the return type of the delegate inferred from the return type of the delegate method.  My thought was maybe theres a way to use a Type parameter to inference the return type. Something like one of thesep  precodepublic delegate T BorrowReaderltTgtIDataReader reader Listltstringgt result  Foo.Barnew BorrowReaderDoFooBarMagic  Look, Ma, no cast var result2  Foo.BarDoFooBarMagic codepre  pWhere the type of the return is inferred from the return type of the delegate method, but that appears not to work. Instead you have to do thisp  precodepublic delegate T BorrowReaderltTgtIDataReader reader var result  Foo.Barnew BorrowReaderltListltstringgtgtDoFooBarMagic codepre  pWhich hardly seems better than the cast.p  pSo is there a way to infer the return type of the delegate from the return type of the delegate method p  pstrongEdit to Addstrong I can change the signature of Foo.Bar if need be.

Negative 1987 pIs there a way to get the ContentType of the response or conversely set the ContentType of an outgoing request in Silverlight using WebClientp  pstrongEditstrongp  pI need to make http requests and be able to show progress for them. I want to package the machinery for making the requests into a generic module and use it everywhere in my code. This I have already done. The difficulty seems to be when submitting different types of data to the server in POST I have no way to tell the server what the data is json,xml,form encode,binary p  pI believe I can deal with this by passing contenttypex with the request, and setting the server to prefer that over the ContentType header.p  pI also have no way to know what kind of content the server responds with, I think I can solve this by passing the expected type of the data when I make a request.p  pIf anyone has a better solution, please speak up p  pstrongEditstrongp  pHeres my predicament. The HttpWebRequestResponse objects implement an internal interface that allows for monitoring the progress of the request. If you want to do large requests its very important that the user get to see a progress bar showing the status of the downloadupload.p  pSo using HttpWebRequestResponse is out. Leaving only WebClient, but Im finding some odd things about it.p  pIt cannot be subclassed. Its not actually sealed, but the constructor is marked [SecuritySafeCritical], which as far as I can tell, means I cant call it from a derived class. At least I failed, and found others on Google who had failed, but I would be very happy to be proved wrong on this point.p  pInternally it uses BrowserHttpWebResponse, which does not override the abstract Headers property, and WebClient.ResponseHeaders just forwards to mResponse.Headers, which just throws NotImplementedException.p  pNot sure ContentType would even be in ResponseHeaders, but I would have liked to check.p  pIt seems that we have the unhappy choice of having progress info or ContentType info but not both in Silverlight.p  pAccording to the docs, there also seems no way to set ContentType on the outgoing request either with WebClient. ContentType is listed as a restricted header. I havent actually tested this though.p  pAlthough its interesting to note that on an error, you actually get passed the response object and have access to StatusCode, ContentType, etc.p

Negative 1987 pSo I have an interesting problem I have a string, and for the most part i know what to expectp  pa hrefhttpwww.someurl.comst relnofollowhttpwww.someurl.comstap  pExcept in this case, the s are either upper case letters or numbers. The problem is, the string has garbage mixed in the string is broken up into 5 or 6 pieces, and in between theres lots of junk unprintable characters, foreign characters, as well as plain old normal characters. In short, stuff thats apt to look like this NymMnqp  pUsually the last 8 characters the s are together right at the end, so at the moment I just have PHP grab the last 8 chars and hope for the best. Occasionally, that doesnt work, so I need a more robust solution. p  pbThe problem is technically unsolvable, but I think the best solution is to grab characters from the end of the string while they are upper case or numeric. If I get 8 or more, assume that is correct. Otherwise, find the st and grab characters going forward as many as I need to fill up the 8 character quota. Is there a regex way to do this or will i need to roll up my sleeves and go nestedloop stylebp  pbupdatebp  pTo clear up some confusion, I get an input string thats like thisp  precode[garbage]http[garbage]somewe[garbage]bsite.co[garbage]msomething[garbage] codepre  pexcept the garbage is in unpredictable locations in the string except the end is never garbage, and has unpredictable length at least, I have been able to find patterns in neither. Usually the s are all together hence me just grabbing the last 8 chars, but sometimes they arent which results in some missing data and returned garbage p

Therefore I thought MT manages these object automatically, but apparently it doesnt or its buggy. p  pEven when I dont mess with the CGPDF objects Dispose, the above error occurs, when I remove the view, that contains the PDF, from the superview.  p  pHas someone been able to work with PDFs in MonoTouch  p  pThanks in advance.p  pUPDATEbr I tested PDF drawing in ObjC with the same PDFs and found out that when I dont call CGPDFDocumentRelease the memory consumption has the same tendency to go rapidly up as in MonoTouch. By calling the CGPDFDocumentRelease in ObjC the memory consumption is normal.br Therefore I think that MonoTouch really doesnt free up the CGPDFDocument and CGPDFPage objects and when I try to free them manually or indirectly by removing the views which contain them, I get the above error.  p  pThis sucks big time and it is a real possibility now, that I have to rewrite the code in ObjC ... Fkp  pANOTHER UPDATEbr Im still not able to decypher why I get the release related errors, but I made a MonoTouch and an XCode project, where both do essentially the same thing draw PDFs.br I compared the memory usage of both in Activity Monitor and found out that while the MonoTouch app increases memory usage constantly, the XCode one doesnt. I even call the Dispose on the CGPDFDocument object in MonoTouch and still the memory consumption increases.br Neither apps crash with the release related error, but its really worrying that the mem usage is so drasticly larger in the MonoTouch app...p  pI figure that my problem lies somewhere else, but I got here because my main app crashed after mem consumption got too high and I cant seem to find a way to bring it down, because I get these annoying release errors.p  pAND ANOTHER UPDATEbr The code that draws the pdf in the views Draw methodp  precodeCGContext context  UIGraphics.GetCurrentContext  context.SaveState  CGPDFDocument pdfDoc  CGPDFDocument.FromUrlpdfFileUrl ifpdfDoc.Pages gt 1      CGPDFPage pdfPage  pdfDoc.GetPage1        context.ScaleCTMSCALE.Width, SCALE.Height      the PDFRectangle is the media box rect of the page, which is hardcoded      for now     context.TranslateCTMthis.PDFRectangle.X, this.PDFRectangle.Height  this.PDFRectangle.Y      context.DrawPDFPagepdfPage   pdfDoc.Dispose  context.RestoreState codepre

Negative 1987 pI read in a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb298408 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb298408a that IIS6.0 automatically responds with a courtesy redirect HTTP 301 on URLs that lack a dot.  p  blockquote   pWhen a browser requests a URL such as a hrefhttpwww.servername.deSubDir relnofollowhttpwww.servername.deSubDira, the browser is redirected to a hrefhttpwww.servername.deSubDir relnofollowhttpwww.servername.deSubDira. A trailing slash is included at the end of the URL.   p      pInternet Information Server IIS first treats SubDir as a file that it should give back to the browser. If this file cannot be found, IIS checks to see if there is a directory with this name. If a directory with this name exists, a courtesy redirect with a 302 Object moved response message is returned to the browser. This message also contains the information about the new location of the directory with the trailing slash. In turn, the browser starts a new GET request to the URL with the trailing slash.p blockquote  pHow does this behavior intersect with a framework like ASP.NET MVC, which employs URLs that do not require or use dots, in general p  pSpecifically... does ASP.NET MVC turn off this feature of IIS6.0 when installed  If so, howp  pI would guess that is emnotem the case, but instead the request routing done in IIS sends the request to ASPNET before performing the redirect.

Negative 1987 pIm getting in trouble. Im trying to emulate the call Application.Run using Application.DoEvents... this sounds bad, and then I accept also alternative solutions to my question...p  pI have to handle a message pump like Application.Run does, but I need to execute code before and after the message handling. Here is the main significant snippet of code.p  precode Create barrier multiple kernels synchronization sKernelBarrier  new KernelBarriersKernels.Count  foreach RenderKernel k in sKernels       Create rendering contexts one for each kernel     k.CreateRenderContext      Start render kernel kernels     k.mThread  new ThreadRenderKernelMain     k.mThread.Startk   while sKernelBarrier.KernelCount gt 0       Wait untill all kernel loops has finished     sKernelBarrier.WaitKernelBarrier      Do application events     Application.DoEvents      Execute shared context services     foreach RenderKernelContextService s in sContextServices         s.ExecutesSharedContext       Next kernel render loop     sKernelBarrier.ReleaseKernelBarrier  codepre  pThis snippet of code is execute by the Main routine. Pratically I have a list of Kernel classes, which runs in separate threads, these threads handle a Form for rendering in OpenGL. I need to synchronize all the Kernel threads using a barrier, and this work perfectly. Of course, I need to handle Form messages in the main thread Main routine, for every Form created, and indeed I call Application.DoEvents to do the job.p  pNow I have to modify the snippet above to have a common Form simple dialog box without consuming the 100 of CPU calling Application.DoEvents, as Application.Run does.p  pThe goal should be to have the snippet above handle messages when arrives, and issue a rendering releasing the barrier only when necessary, without trying to get the maximum FPS there should be the possibility to switch to a strict loop to render as much as possible.p  pHow could it be possiblep  pNote the snippet above must be executed in the Main routine, since the OpenGL context is created on the main thread. Moving the snippet in a separated thread and calling Application.Run is quite unstable and buggy...p
Negative 1987 pI am trying to create an application can modify properties in IL to create a slightly different executable. E.g Client A runs app and a label on the WinForm label Reads Client A. Client B runs the app and Label Says Client B. Easy I know using config files or resource files but thats not an option for this project. The Main program needs to be able to  generate .exe file dynamically based on some form fields entered by user. p  pMy solution was to create a standalone executable that contained all the elements which I needed to make dynamic. I then used ildasm to generate the IL and thought that I could use this IL and substitute tags for the elements i wanted to make dynamic. I could then replace those tags at runtime after user filled the form using regex etc.  The problem is, the if i re save the IL file generated by ILDASM as an exe and try to run it. I just launches console and does nothing.p  pAm I going about this the wrong way I didnt want to delve into Reflection as the dynamic .exe is a really simple one and I thought reverse engineering IL with ildasm would be the quickest way.p  pYou thoughts and pointers are much appreciated.

Negative 1987 pI had a discussion with my colleague about Flash security. Were in the phase of planning some things for our web project that is using Flash plugin to display content. We need to dynamically pull settings for the Flash application from the server, using JSON.p  pProposal that I offered was that we should save an extra HTTP request to pull the data file after the plugin is loaded and embed the JSON directly in the page containing the Flash plugin. Flash would fire a Javascript function thatd return the deserialized JSON data to it.p  pMy colleague opposed this proposal with significant security concerns.p  pI believe that theres literally zero difference between these two approaches besides the fact that his approach requires additional HTTP request. All of this is clientserver and client should never be trusted. If I want to change the data that is in the JSON query, I can do that in both cases. File pull is little more difficult to hack though, but possible with custom HTTP proxy.p  pWhat are your thoughtsp

Negative 1987 pAs I understand, the audio byte array that I am using PCM Stereo 16bit is 4 bytes per sample.

I experimented with inverting every other byte every 2 bytes rather than all of the bytes and got something like surround sound, but its very dirty and choppy.

Negative 1987 pI am currently working on a legacy programme that has been written in C and C it executes some heavyweight calculations but should be completly deterministic. i.e. the same inputs will yeild the same outputs... Problem is that 2 runs on the same computer, using the same compiled executable produce slightly different outputs.p  pThe application reads and writes to a SQL server database it has unique access to the DB so nothing else should be interfering with the DB values.p  pThe only obvious difference between runs is that they are each assigned a unique name just a string variable.p  pThere are no random objects within the code and all loops run for either a predetermined number of iterations or until a condition is met, they dont run for a certain amount of time.There is a small amount of multithreading, which I have been assured is threadsafe, but I will check this for myself.p  pAre there any other obvious things that I should be looking for, which would cause this deviant behaviour p

Negative 1987 pWe have a large C project with development happening on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.  Most of our Windows developers use MSVC  for example, the free edition of Visual C.  Oftentimes .c source files are added, renamed or deleted, and we find it very frustrating to keep the Visual C project in sync with these changes to directories.p  pDeveloper A might add newfile.c, check it in to Subversion and happily continue work.p  pDevelopers B, C, etc. update to the latest revision.  Then when they compile in MSVC they get an error buried somewhere in the huge compile output saying the linker cant find suchandsuch symbol.  They then need to look to see what files have changed and manually add that to the project tree in MSVC.p  pDeveloper A might be on Unix where build scripts tend to automatically find the right files to compile, and not realise how much work theyve just created for B and Cp  pMy question is, is there a way to tell MSVC to consider every .c file in a directory as part of the projectp  pstrongUpdatestrong We have build scripts that can create initial MSVC project files.  But theres a signicifant amount of customisation that gets done after this pointing to libraries, etc. which would be blown away each time the scripts were rerun merely to add a new file.p  pGiven how many large projects there are out there, Im kind of surprised Visual Studio requires such manual work by each developer just to pick up new files added by others.   Im going to optimistically hold out for a better solution for now...p

Negative 1987 pAccording to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa27391328vvs.6029.aspxMSDNa, the codeZpcode command defaults to 8, which means 64bit alignment boundaries are used.

For examplep  precodestruct Test     char foo    int bar  codepre  pThe compiler will pad it like sop  precodestruct Test     char foo    char padding[3]    int bar  codepre  pSo, since codeZp8code is used by default, does that mean my padding becomes 74 bytes using the same example abovep  precodestruct Test     char foo    char padding1[7]    int bar    char padding2[4]   Structure has 16 bytes, ending on an 8byte boundary codepre  pThis is a bit ridiculous isnt it Am I misunderstanding Why is such a large padding used, it seems like a waste of space. Most types on a 32bit system arent even going to use 64bits, so the majority of variables would have padding probably over 80.p

Negative 1987 pI have created a tabbar based application which contains, let say, 3 tabs.

On clicking button 2,  a different view is loaded Viewcontroller 2 and tab 2 should be highlighted as selected tab Remember, this viewcontroller 2 is not the root view controller of tab 2 and on clicking button 3, again a new view is shown viewcontroller 3 and tab 3 should be highlighted as selected Remember, this viewcontroller 3 is not the root view controller of tab 3. So, what I want to do is, I want a particular tab to be shown as selected or highlighted, but dont want to load its root view controller. I have tried using tabbarcontroller.selectedindex  1 on clicking of button 1, but it went in vain. Because what happened was tab 1 got selected and the view being shown to me was not viewcontroller 2. Instead it was the root view controller of tab 2. Somebody pls get me out of this mess....p

It is a big piece  some 25,000 classes. One of the bits that I need to do is to chop off parts of the application that is not being used too much. If I can show to management that there are parts of the application that are being scarcely used, I can chop off those parts from this product and effectively make this product a little more manageable as in the manual regression test suite that needs to run every week or so and takes a couple of days, can be shortened. p  pHope there is some ready solution to this. p

Negative 1987 pOur new iPhone project consists of a native app and a server it needs to communicate with. Id like the server to be written in PythonDjango.p  pThe last time we created something similar, the server was in written in asp.net and it exposed relevant methods as a SOAPbased web service. This was very convenient, since we were able to generate almost all server communication code from the WSDL using a hrefhttpsudzc.com relnofollowhttpsudzc.coma. Now I basically want to do the same, but with Django instead of asp.net. More specifically, I want to expose methods and objects over an API and Id really like to have some automatic ObjectiveC code generation at the other end.p  pIve looked at a few libraries for Django that are supposed to expose RESTful APIs, and most people seem to recommend djangopiston or djangorestframework. Will either of them have a WSDLstyle description that I can use to autogenerate ObjCcode, though Is there another set of tools for achieving what Im after that I should be investigatingp

Negative 1987 pI am developing a C application which needs floatingpoint determinism.  I would also like the floatingpoint operations to be fairly fast.  This includes standard transcendental functions not specified by IEEE754 like sine and logarithm.  The software floatingpoint implementations I have considered are relatively slow, compared to hardware floating point, so I am considering simply rounding away one or two of the least significant bits from each each answer.  The loss of precision is an adequate compromise for my application, but will this suffice to ensure deterministic results across platforms  All floatingpoint values will be doubles.p  pI realize order of operations is another potential source for variance in floatingpoint results.  I have a way to address that already.  p  pIt would be terrific if there were software implementations of the major floatingpoint hardware implementations in use today, so I could test a hypothesis like this directly.p

Negative 1987 pIm testing my Magento store with a bought theme at Princessly.com which I have been testing and customizing since 4 months ago. I have an obsession of testing ALL different  possible pages of a site before launching it. In most cases, the site is simple enough to have about 3  10 different types of pages list page, article page, contact form page, about page, etc. which I would go through one by one to tweak and customize into every minor detail.p  pHowever, Magento based on Zend Framework seems to be very versatile in having all different sorts of pages accessible from a variety of different URLs even for the same content. Understandably, the user experience is much more sophisticated with a eCommerce site than that of a content site, thus having many more types of pages. p  pIn addition to the problem, theme designers may not fully understand Magento. They would usually left many notsocommon pages undesigned with just default styles that would look pretty ugly to users who step on them.p  pMy question is, stronghow can I find a reference  list of ALL possible Magento pages so that I can go through them one by one to make a consistenly good design throughout the entire Magento storestrongp  pThanks a lot It sucks to have obsessive disorders.p

Negative 1987 pThis question is sort of a sequel to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10009654entityframeworkcallingtolistoniqueryablewith11000recordstakes10sthata question. p  pWhen we want to build a WCF service which works with some kind of data, its natural that we want it to be fast and efficient. In order to achieve that, we have to make sure all segments of data road trip work as fast as they could, from data storage backend such as SQL Server, to a WCF client who requested that data.p  pWhile seeking for an answer on that previous question, we have learned, thanks to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers270591slaumaSlaumaa and others who contributed through comments, that the time consuming part of Entity Frameworks first large query is object materialization and attaching entities to the context when the result from the database is returned. We have seen that everything works much faster on subsequent queries.p  pAssuming those large queries are used as readonly operations, we came to a conclusion that we could set EF codeMergeOptioncode to codeNoTrackingcode, yielding better first query performance. What we have done with codeNoTrackingcode was telling EF to create separate object for each record retrieved from the database  even when they have the same key. This will cause additional processing if we have code.Includecode statement in our query, which will lead to data with much larger size being returned.p  pThe data may be so big that we could easily ask ourselves  did we really help our cause by using codeNoTrackingcode option, even if we made the query faster and maybe only the first one, depending on the number of code.Includecode statements, because subsequent queries without codeNoTrackingcode option with multiple code.Includecode statements run faster simply because codeNoTrackingcode option causes a lot more objects to be created when data returns from the serverp  pThe biggest problem is how to efficiently serialize this amount of data  and deserialize it on the client. With serialization already as slow as it is I am using codeDataContractSerializercode with codePreserveObjectReferencescode set to codetruecode because I am sending EF 4.x generated POCOs to my client and vice versa, do we want to generate even more data thanks to codeNoTrackingcode To be honest, I havent seen the data originated from the query with codeNoTrackingcode option on 11.000 objects not including navigation properties obtained via code.Includecode, arriving at the client side yet. Last time I tried to pull this off, the timeout of 001000 was triggered p  pSo if you are still reading this wall of text, you tell me how to solve this situation. Which serializer to use in order to achieve acceptable results Currently, if I dont use the codeNoTrackingcode option, the serialization, transport and deserialization of 11.000, via codewsHttpBindingcodelike custom binding on the local machine take 5 seconds. Whats scary to me is that this large table is most likely going to contain 500.000 records eventually.p

Negative 1987 pIve got a 2 part questionp  pstrongFirst questionstrong I know that there is a query limit of 5,000 records when querying records, for performance reasons, but is there a limit when doing an aggregate query If so, what is it I need only to query the number of records and for one entity I can get a result of 39,000 records, but for another entity I see an error message likep  pcodeSystem.ServiceModel.FaultException 1[Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationServiceFault] AggregateQueryRecordLimit exceeded. Cannot perform this operation. Fault Detail is equal to Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationServiceFault.codep  pIve been looking all over online but cant find anything on a query limit for aggregatecount queries.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong Is there a simple way to query the COUNT of a large amount of records without a performance hit I wouldnt think doing a count should require too much overhead. If there IS a limit, my idea was to implement paging in a loop and just retrieve the count for a given page while incrementing the page number each time until 0 records was returned. However, when I tried this, it seems to ignore the codepagecode and codecountcode attributes of the initial codeltFetchgtcode tag.p  pIm wondering if there is a bettereasier way to do thisp  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 1987 pIm writing an SVN precommit.bat file which calls a Python script to query our issue tracking system to determine of the usersupplied issue tracking ID is in the correct state e.g. open state and associated with the right project. The SVN server is running Windows 2003 server I think  I can check with our IT group if it matters.... p  pThe issue is that I cant seem to make the SVN commit fail it always succeeds. AFAIK the Python script is doing what it should it calls sys.exit1 for failures and sys.exit0 for success. For the .bat file I have adapted some examples in this forum which are said to work and as of yet, no luck. Heres the slightly simplified .bat file,p  precodeecho off  set repos1  set transaction2  set projferry  Python26python svnsync.py s reposrepos transactiontransaction projectproj   IF ERRORLEVEL GTR 0 GOTO err else exit 0   REM This should return a failure to Subversion, but does not err  echo 1gtamp2    echo Your commit has failed due to invalid PR or PR state. 1gtamp2    echo Thanks 1gtamp2 exit 1 codepre  pAgain I know that the script is being run i.e. not a env variable issue on the server, and the codesys.exit1codecode is being hit. Also Im quite sure the err function getting run, it is simply that the exit 1 return code is getting ignored by SVNp  pNote Not quite true the only way I have ever made a commit fail is when the Python script has a runtime error. Generating an intentional runtime error, however, is not an acceptable workaround in this case.p  pThanks for your interest.p
Negative 1987 pI am writing a game enginelibrary in which I have an event dispatcher class which dispatches events by calling listener methods of registered event handler classes. One can register an event handlerlistener with the event dispatcher by calling the appropriate dispatcher method.p  pThis obviously leads to some boilerplate code for registering every event handlerand also other aspects of my engine have similar bolierplate code, so I was wondering  how about just using Instrumentation to add in all of the necessary code during loading of the event handler class, so that no explicit registration with the event dispatcher is necessary while coding  the call to the dispatchers register method is added in automatically when the program is run.p  pIt is my understanding that in order to use Instrumentation one should use some bytecode modifier API.

Another reason is, that the generated source code should not be changed  I dont want somebody to edit it by accident, thinking it is a regular code.p  pThe following works, but only when overwriting existing configuration with codegradle eclipsecode.p  precodeeclipse.classpath.file      whenMerged  classpath gt         classpath.entries.removeAll               entry gt entry.kind  src ampamp entry.path  srcgenjava                codepre  pHowever, it does not work if the configuration is cleaned  codegradle cleanEclipse eclipsecode , which is what happens when you first import the project in eclipse.p  pReading the a hrefhttpgradle.orgdocscurrentdslorg.gradle.plugins.ide.eclipse.model.EclipseClasspath.html relnofollowEclipseClasspath object documentationa, I figure that the only other way is to use codeeclipse.classpath.file.withXmlcode , but it seams too messy to edit the raw xml.p  pIs there any other more elegant solutionp

Negative 1987 pI have a python script running on a small server that is called in three different ways  from within another python script, by cron, or by gammusmsd an SMS daemon with the wonderful mobile utility [gammu].  The script is for maintenance and contained the following kludge to measure used space on the system presumably this is possible from within Python, but this was quick and dirtyp  pcodereportdict[Used Space]  subprocess.checkoutput[df   tail 1  awk  print 5 ], shellTrue[01]codep  pOddly enough this line would strongonlystrong fail when the script was called by a shell script running from gammusmsd.  The line would fail with a CalledProcessError exception saying returned exit status 2, even though the output attribute of the CalledProcessError object contained the correct output.  The only command in the sequence of shell commands that would give such an error status would be awk, with status 2 indicating a fatal error. p  pIf the python script with this line was called by cron, by another python script, or from the command line, this line would work fine.  I broke my head trying to fix the environment for the script, thinking this must be the problem.  Finally though I put in stderrsubprocess.STDOUT, like sop  pcodereportdict[Used Space]  subprocess.checkoutput[df   tail 1  awk  print 5 ], stderrsubprocess.STDOUT, shellTrue[01]codep  pThis was a debug measure to help me figure out if some output was coming on stderr.

Negative 1987 pI am asking a general question about UI tab bar controller. In my app there is a login screen and on succesful login a tab bar based interface needs to be displayed. So I have navigation controller as the root controller and I am pushing a tab bar controller onto the navigation stack after succesful login. It is working fine for me. Tabs are coming and switching is also working. Just that content view controllers title that is displayed on the navigation bar is not coming. When I add content view controller directly to the navigation stack it comes but when my content view controller is inside tab bar the title doesnt come. Also I hav read on many websites that tab bar controller should not be added as a child of any other controller. It should always be the root controller of the window. Then what I am doing is not the right usage How do I go about it I cant make tab bar controller as the root controller in app delegate because there is a login screen and navigation requirement. Please guide me. I do know that similar questions have been posted before but I was not able to understand this clearly.  p

Negative 1987 pI have a token interceptor to block double submitting a form which works great, but Im looking to reset the token under circumstances.p  pEssentially what Ive got in the page is a list of criteria and a submit button.  When the user clicks the submit button, the criteria is stored as a new row in a specific table in the database.  An ajax call updates the div underneath the form with a succeeded or failed message.  The token works in that I dont want the user attempting to add duplicate rows.  However, if you user changes the criteria either by choosing a different option in a dropdown menu or editing the text in stextfield I want it to reset the token to allow form submission again.  Currently the user has to go back and fill out a new form which is somewhat inconvenient.p  pIm using the standard stoken in the .jsp and interceptor lines in struts.xml.  Ive been searching for something to reset the token but I havent found anything.  Thanks.p

Is there code I can include in VC1 that will detect that VC2 has just been popped off the stack  p  pSince Im trying to detect the popping of VC2 from within the code for VC1 it seems that something like strongviewWillAppearstrong or strongviewDidAppearstrong wont work, because those methods fire every time VC1 is displayed, including when it is first pushed on the stack.p  pstrongEDITstrong it seems I was not very clear with my original question.  Heres what Im trying to do determine when VC1 is being shown due to VC2 being popped off the top of the stack.

Negative 1987 pOk so I am designing my companies new website. I have a fixed navigation at the top of the page with links that scroll to the desired sections of the webpage using codejQuerycode.

I cant use messaging, because it isnt basic data. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1987 pIm pretty new to namespaces and yes, Ive read the PHP documentation namespaces section. Im wondering what the scope of namespaces is with regard to multiple files.

Would that work like thisp  precodenamespace A class Abc  ...  codepre  pAnd then lets say I have some file with global code, call it B.phpp  precodenamespace B includeA.php class Abc  ...  abc  new BAbc  Should be namepsace B Abc, right abcFromNameSpace  new AAbc  Should be namespace A Abc, right codepre

Negative 1987 pI wrote a function in R  called filtre it takes a dataframe, and for each line it says whether it should go in say bin 1 or 2. At the end, we have two data frames that sum up to the original input, and corresponding respectively to all lines thrown in either bin 1 or 2. These two sets of bin 1 and 2 are referred to as filtre1 and filtre2. For convenience the values of filtre1 and filtre2 are calculated but not returned, because it is an intermediary thing in a bigger process plus they are quite big data frame. I have the following issue p  pi When I later on want to use filtre1 or filtre2, they simply dont show up... like if their value was stuck within the function, and would not be recognised elsewhere  which would oblige me to copy the whole function every time I feel like using it  quite painful and heavy. p  pI suspect this is a rather simple thing, but I did search on the web and did not find the answer really I was not sure of best key words.

Negative 1987 pIm upgrading a Rails 3.2.13 application from Ruby 1.8.7p370 to Ruby 1.9.3p385. After upgrading, special characters are garbled in text retrieved from the database.

If I change the codeencodingcode option to codeutf8code, I once again see the garbled text caf.p  pI also tried placing a breakpoint in codeActiveRecordConnectionAdapterscode, to see how what encoding configuration Rails was initializing the codeMysql2Clientcode with. It is being passed codeencoding gt latin1code, as expected.p  pAnd yet somewhere along the line, Rails decides to decode the text as utf8. How do I get Rails to respect the latin1 encoding configuration I specified Thanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 1987 pI have been working on this problem for a few days, and its driving me totally crazy. Im using Storyboards. p  pI have viewcontroller1 with a webview. The webview populates a html login form, through a textField username another textField password and then a button submit which work perfect once pushing the button, the html form is populated with my textFields input. Once the form is filled and submitted, I want the user to be sent to a new viewcontroller viewController2 which has a webview, that I want to populate with some of the stuff from the website. I cant, for the world, find out how to send the user to the next view. p  pAnother detail is that the login html form has a user type select. Hence, the adress the submit button sends me can be different. If its a teacher filling out the form the returned address is going to be something like myschooljspteacherrightteacherlessonstatus.jsp and if its a student something else, and if its from another school, something else. p  pThis is the code Ive tried to send the user to the next view containing UIwebview2 p  precode BOOLwebViewUIWebView webView shouldStartLoadWithRequestNSURLRequest request  navigationType  UIWebViewNavigationTypenavigationType     if navigationType  UIWebViewNavigationTypeFormSubmitted    UIStoryboard storyboard  [UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameMainStoryboard bundlenil]   ViewController2 vc  [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierwebview2]   NSLogAllow navigation to request  , request    [self.navigationController pushViewControllervc animatedYES]    return YES   codepre  pThe NSLog tells mep  blockquote   pAllow navigation to request myschooljspteacherrightteacherlessonstatus.jsp p blockquote  pSo if I tell the webview2 the address it will surely pick it up.

I actually create Rectangle objects and then add them to the Canvas which works really nice and is very useful, since I also add event handlers to those rectangles mouse click.p  pI have a problem with the performance though. When I add the rectangles and set the Stroke property SolidColorBrush the whole process is slowing down extremely. Without those strokes set the speed is ok.p  pI already improved the performance a little by adding Rectangle objects to a newly created Canvas object and then adding this new Canvas object to the original Canvas object so not all rectangles are direkt children of the original Canvas, which should help speeding things up.p  pSo my question is how it is possible to add a Stroke to all those Rectangles without breaking the speed.p  pYou can find a comparison of the strokeless and stroked treemap versions in the links.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comQ2Jaz.jpg relnofollowTreemap without Strokesap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comXyksl.jpg relnofollowTreemap with Strokesap  pThank you very much for your helpp  pemstrongeditemstrongp  pOk, I have found a solutionp  pSorry for writing here first, but I already searched for hours to find a solution but now I found out tht the problem was my used SolidColorBrushp  pI have something like thisp  precodepublic static SolidColorBrush TreeMapBorderBrush codepre  pAnd I use this Brush to set the Stroke property of every Rectangle that should be added to the Canvas. But exactly that was the problem.p  pThe code looked like this beforep  precoderect.Stroke  VisualizationHelper.TreeMapBorderBrush codepre  pI changed it to this nowp  precoderect.Stroke  VisualizationHelper.TreeMapBorderBrush.Clone codepre  pSo I only work with a copy of that Brush on each Rectangle now, which speeds up the processing like there was no Stroke like in my questionp  pJust for your information Weirdp
Negative 1987 pI have searched high and low trying to find the answer to this in respects to what I want to achieve here and found nothing. Maybe someone can help me out or point me in the right direction.p  pWhat I want to do is have an image gallery with thumbnails that when you mouse over display a larger image on the page that is normally hidden and dim the rest of the page.p  pI have seen a few tutorials out there explaining something similar but none of them showed exactly how to control one divs visibility by hovering another object.p  pMaybe I am just missing something simple here and if anyone can help me to understand how you can go about controlling the visibility property of diva by hovering divbp  pthanks Evanp

Negative 1987 pI am trying to set up an NSView that will be overlaid on top of a video that is being played by AVFoundation. I really just want to create something that looks similar to the native quicktime player. I am trying to do this on an OS X application.p  pI have set up an NSView that has two subviews a view to play the video and a view to encompass the controls. Whenever I start playing the video the controls view gets pushed behind the video playing view rendering the controls view useless.p  pI believe the problem has to do with overlaying two subviews that are on the same level in view hierarchy. This problem would lead to the solution of making the controls view a subview of the video playing view. The problem is that to play a video with AVFoundation the video playing view must become a layer hosting view, which prevents it from having subviews.p  pThings I have tried to solve the problemp  ul liUsing codeaddSubviewpositionedrelativeTocode to reorder the views.li liMaking the super view and the controls view layer backed.li ul  pI might be using these solutions wrong so if you believe they should work let me know.p  pThis is how I set up my video playing view.p  precodeself.playerItem  [AVPlayerItem playerItemWithAssetself.asset] [self.playerItem addObserverself forKeyPathstatus              options0 contextampItemStatusContext] self.player  [AVPlayer playerWithPlayerItemself.playerItem]  self.playerLayer  [AVPlayerLayer playerLayerWithPlayerself.player]  [self.playerView setLayerself.playerLayer] [self.playerView setWantsLayerYES] codepre  pThis seems like a common thing someone would want to do for video playback, so if anyone knows a solution please let me know.

Negative 1987 pIm trying to write a script javascript in an API of a Virtual Table Top program so I can manipulate some tokens Car Wars .p  pIm sort of finding the answer, but it seems like Im struggling and reinventing the wheel so I thought Id ask for help.  One reason Im getting confused is the program returns results based on y is down and Deg go clockwise which is different than what all the trig formulas want counter clockwise and y is up.p  pHere is what I have access to.  Rectangle rotates around centre, Centre pointx,y, width, height, and rotation.  Ive got the code working for moving the rectangle in the direction of the rotation, side to side, up and down, etc.  Now I need to be able to rotate it around any of the four corners or any point would be nice, but four corners are all thats needed.p  pIt wont let me include an image since Im new so I hope the description is good enough.  I had an image all done up. p  pIn the API I cant actually draw the rectangle, I can only set its rotation, and centre value.  So my thought was if I can find the x,y of one corner currently, then rotate it the desired degs around the centre I can do this easily by setting the rectangles rotation, find the new x,y of that same corner.  Then I will know the offset and apply that to the centre thats how the rectangle is moved as well.p  pSo I need to be able to find the x,y of any corner of a rectangle at any given starting angle, then again at a new angle rotated at its centre.  This offset would then be easily applied to the centre x,y and the rectangle would see to have rotated along one of its corners.p  pThanks for any help you can give.  Im hoping I will eventually figure it out, just writing this description out actually has helped me think it through.  But Im currently stuckp  pKonradp

Negative 1987 pIve searched other answers and none of them seem to produce the desired results I am looking for.p  pHere is my table removed and added rendered HTML at the bottom.p  pCurrently it isnt wrapping the text so the table looks nice and clean.  However I have some REALLY long Procedures names and so the table is pushed off the page.p  pWhat I want to happen is if the name is longer than the width of the cell it hides the text.p  pI really only want the procedure to have width constrains.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVFCtW.png altenter image description herep  pEDIT adding rendered HTMLp  pI have added no additional CSS to this

Negative 1987 pI am having trouble using shared memory, semaphores and forks in Unix C. My semaphores are not posix.  I create a pointer to shared memory 2sizeoffloat. I initialize the value of my semaphore to 2 with semctl. I do a fork in a for loop ilt2.  In the child processes if fork  0 each child does a p operation on the semaphore 1, writes to shared memory then does a v operation 1 then exits. The Parent process does a p operation 2 on the semaphore, reads the entirety of the shared memory segmentwith a for loop and does a v operation 2. He waits on the child processes before exiting to avoid zombies. The problem i have in output is that i get  p  precode Parent reading 0  Parent reading 1  Parent reading 0  Parent reading 1  Child writing 0  Child writing 1 codepre  pWhen what i should be getting is p  precode Child writing 0  Child writing 1  Parent reading 0  Parent reading 1 codepre  pI have tried initializing my semaphore to 1 instead of 2 but that just stalls the program since the semaphore will never have a value of two and thus the parent process will never read.p  pIf what i have understood about semaphores is correct, the fact that i initialize it to 2 means that the parent process can directly read even though none of the children have written anything.

This way, I avoid having an actual HTML file for every single fruit. I can instead have a single landing template that gets populated with variable fruit data.p  pThe part Im hung up on is passing the url into the Dart app so it can do the handling. I understand codemaincode cannot receive arguments, so whats another wayp

Negative 1987 pI am in the situation where my application needs to inspect the contentdatabodypayload of a POST request without changing the results of subsequent getParameter calls.p  pstrongReading the body from the inputStreamstrongp  pThe body can be read using the InputStream from coderequest.getInputStreamcode or BufferedReader from coderequest.getReadercode.p  pstrongReading POST parametersstrongp  pPOST requests typically include request parameters in the body of the request. These can be retrieved using codegetParametercode.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pthe first codegetParametercode call internally parses the inputStream and inserts all parameters into a parameter HashMap.  It requires the inputStream to still contain the contents for parsing.  Thus one cannot inspect the content and still have a working getParameter call.p  pstrongProposed but not sufficient Solutionstrongp  pCreate a request wrapper that caches the inputstream and returns the cache for getInputStream.p  pIve seen that solution suggested all over the web, but it doesnt work, because codegetParametercode doesnt actually call codegetInputStreamcode, but refers to the original inputBuffer buried in the request object.  Ive tried it, both from within the Servlet and by using a filterp  pThe only solution I can think of involves rewriting getParameter to actually parse the cached inputstream manually.  But this feels like a bad idea.p  pDoes anybody have any alternative that works  This is Tomcat 5.5  This feels like it should be a common usecase I cant believe how difficult it is. p

Negative 1987 pI need help convincing a 3rd party software vendor to change their APIs to pass along some user data to callbacks.p  pThis seems to be a standard practice as I see it often wherever callbacks are used. Im looking for some ammunition to give to their development team to convince them to do this.p  pMy reasoning is that I have created 11 Python bindings for all of their API calls except for the ones that take a callback. If their APIs also took a void for user data... for examplep  precodeSOMEAPIregisterfunctionchar name, char desc, void callback, void userdata codepre  pinstead of...p  precodeSOMEAPIregisterfunctionchar name, char desc, void callback codepre  pThis would make it much easier or even possible for me to create bindings for these functions. My bindings are currently in Cython which lacks the ability to dynamically create valid C callbacks. I believe the cffi Python library provides this ability but these bindings are a little slower in performance and Im worried about the kind of magic theyre doing to pull it off.... also I dont want to port my bindings.p  pThe problem is, even though were paying customers of this software, it takes a lot to get them to even acknowledge bugs let alone provide new features.  The more ammo I have the better. Any documentation of programming guides, best practices, etc. that says to provide a void for user data would be helpful.p

Negative 1987 pI am reading Java Generics and Collections section 8.4.

Since it defines   only compareToObject, client code that calls compareToName rather than compareToObject will invoke the method on SimpleName where it is defined rather than   ExtendedName where it is not defined, so the base names will be compared but the   extensions ignored.p blockquote  pHowever when I make only Name and SimpleName generic I get a compile time error and not what the author describes above. The error isp  blockquote   pname clash compareToObject in NameHalfMovedToGenerics.ExtendedName and compareToT in Comparable have the same erasure, yet neither overrides the otherp blockquote  pAnd this is not the first time I am facing such an issue  earlier while trying to read Sun documentation on erasure I faced a similar issue where my code doesnt show the same result as described by the author.p  pHave I made a mistake in understanding what the author is trying to sayp  pAny help will be much appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 1987 pI got a project which required making venn diagrams, and I am starting to learn python using 2.7 so I figured trying to learn R as well would overload me with work. So, I learned online about matplotlib. Basically, what I need to do is create a venn diagram which compares the value under every column to generate a venn diagram. So if my csv had the following datap  precodeMonth    x    y Sept    1    1 Oct    0    1 Nov    1    1 Dec    1    1 codepre  pThe overlap would show a value of 2 because nov and dec have the same value, the x circle by itself would show a value of 1, from sept the 0 needs to be ignored, and the y circle would show a value of 2, from sept and oct.p  pI think this is a pretty complicated program, but I have no idea where to start, other than just starting withp  precodefrom matplotlibvenn import venn2 codepre  pWhen I use an online tool such as a hrefhttpbioinfogp.cnb.csic.estoolsvenny relnofollowVennya, it just finds the numbers that are similar between the lists instead of doing a rowbyrow comparison. This results in nothing in values of 0 in the outer circles, and the number 3 in the overlap because there are three different values in the input 1, 0, and 1.p  pAlternatively, if this would instead be very easy using R instead of Python, could you help me with thatp  pAny help would be appreciated, thanksp

Negative 1987 pIm able to authenticate implicit grant from my client application. I receive an codeaccesstokencode. Now, I know that my client can now call a protected API.p  pThe ASP.net client will primarily make AJAX calls using the codeaccesstokencode for any CRUD operation. This client will have multiple pages, though, so we will need to maintain logged in state across any postbacks and navigating awayreturn.p  pIt seems like the client will have to store the access token in Session to maintain logged in state it across postbacks. So, lets say I do store the codeaccesstokencode in session, and then make it available to JS so that it can make AJAX calls.p  pIf the user never navigates away from the page, we could run into codeaccesstokencode expiration, and I dont want to have the user log in again. Yes, I can probably request another token in JS with my older refresh token, but then the new codeaccesstokencode is not saved to Session.p  pIf the user navigates away, and by the time they return, Session[accesstoken] could time out  what do I do then This can happen frequently and I dont want them to have to log back in every time.p  pSo, it looks like a messy solution to get this straight  when either the Session times out or the codeaccesstokencode expires, I dont want them to have to be redirected to log in again. If the user wants to log out, they should either do so explicitly clicking on a log out link or closing the browser.p  pAny tips, [code] solutions, lesserknown technology, anything for thisp

Negative 1987 pI currently have a function that is able to printout a DataGridView onto a page using System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument  the printing utility runs through my print page function PrintDocPagePrint until it runs out of rows where it will set HasMorePages to false.p  pIm trying to work out the total number of pages before I print so I can put page x of y at the bottom of each page. One way is to work out how many rows fit on each page and work out how many pages there are based on how many rows there are in total, but this doesnt seem very versatile as it relies on each row being the same height, which depending on how its programmed, may not always be the case.p  pThe way I want to do it is to do a phantom print  or basically print it to a null printer in the background without the user knowing. When it does this first print, it can increment a global variable TotalPages each time it runs the print function, then once the phantom print is done stop TotalPages being incremented next time it is printed presumably just by setting a bool once the phantom print is done. This would be more versatile, and would work for data grids with different row heights, or any other type of data I wanted to print.p  pMy question is  is there any way to run a sample print in the background This is done after the user has selected page size and orientation etc, so we do know those essential details, but just before the print preview dialogue is displayed.p  pHeres some code I have... it sort of works, but for some reason it doesnt work all the timep  precode Phantom print to determine number of pages.

Negative 1987 pHello Im aware there are a few similar questions to this but I havent been able to solve my problem.  I need to generate a unique set of points on a sphere in cartesian coordinates i.e. transform from spherical to cartesian. When I do this I store the points in a vector of vectors. However some duplicates are created and to remove them I have tried used the sort erase and unique functions. The problem is that sort doesnt see to sort my entire vector and I dont understand why It works fine for a vector of vectors I just push back numbers into, just not for the vector of vectors generated by my cartesian function.

Negative 1987 pI have an Android library project codeFooLibcode. codeFooLibcode references things like Android codeContextcodes but doesnt require any resource files things in coderescode so I am currently packaging this as a JAR for my app to consume.p  pI now want to make codeFooLibcode depend on codeBarLibcode, but codeBarLibcode emdoesem use resources so I cant package codeBarLibcode as a JAR.

Negative 1987 pI am fairly new to NetSuite and NetSuite scripting. My company has several dozen script files already in the NetSuite File Cabinet, under the default SuiteScripts folder. Also, I am using the SuiteCloud IDE, which is just basically Eclipse with a NetSuite plugin. This way I can download all of the scripts into a single SuiteCloud IDE project, work on them locally, and then upload them back to the server for testing.p  pWhen you create a new NetSuite project, one of the project settings is File Cabinet Folder. This defaults to a subdirectory  under SuiteScripts with the same name as your project. For example, if your project is called MyScripts, the default will be SuiteScriptsMyScripts. You can of course change this, but it is impossible to just specify the SuiteScripts folder alone, as I get an error saying File Cabinet folder must have 2 segments. However, the existing scripts all live under SuiteScripts no subdirectory. Any file that I upload to the server, whether it be a new file that I created locally or even a previously downloaded file that already exists in the File Cabinet, will end up in SuiteScriptsMyScripts. This can be hugely problematic, causing dupes and all kinds of other nastiness. Anyone have any experience with this Thanks.p
Negative 1987 pThis is going to be a confusing one but ill try to be as clear as possible. In essence i have 7 workbooks. 6 being master equipment data sorted by creation date because of handling millions of records they have to be in different workbooks. the last workbook is refined data from the master equipment ie. grouping the different equipment types object type together i have many different refinement workbooks but ill talk about one as can loop for the others. The master equipment gets updated daily with equipments changing and any data within it could change and consequently i need to update the refinement workbook. currently i have a code which is very long and also takes as long to run i am looking for something a LOT quicker. the details of the equipment have up to 15 columns of data about it being placed in set columns and anything could change about it all with a unique ID. firstly i filter the master data to only look at the object type that the refined workbook has in it. i then have to loop through all the rows in the master data, if the unique ID is found in the refined data then it checks to see if all the columns have the same data in, if so happy days and the next row is checked. if not the refined data is replaced with the current master row. at the end if there are any new rows in the master data they are added onto the bottom of the refined data because they are new. we then repeat the whole process for the next master workbook. once all the master workbooks are checked if there are any unique IDs in the refined data that have not appeared in any of the master because the equipment type can change then they are deleted out. i am reluctant to post my code because it is at the limit of what you can have on VBA therefore very long. but certainly i am after ideas of how i can do the process differently to speed it up. when i say hours it takes...more like several days because of the sheer volume of data and the fact everything has to be checked because all the data is variable bar the unique ID. any questions please ask. desperate here.p

Negative 1987 pI wrote a C program that is supposed to create a certain number of child processes, each child process having to change 1 letter from a string. The string and the number of child processes are read from the keyboard.p  pI want to do it using pipes. It should work like this The parent changes one letter, then the first child takes the string modified by the parent and changes one more letter. The second child takes the string modified by the first one 2 letters are already changed and changes one more and so on. I am new to C and am not quite sure how it all works, especially pipes. p  pAlso can the children be linked between them through the pipe, or can they only be linked to the parent and it has to be something like first child changes a letter, gives the string back to the parent and then the second child reads from there, modifies letter and gives back.

I mean, how can I get an CSV export  Query result list where I have the result likep  precodeuserId, userName, toolId, fieldContent1, fieldContent2, fieldContent3 codepre  pI also want to name the Headline of the fieldContent1 to fieldName see table formsfields. So, to all of you MySQL experts out there how can I combine those 4 tables in one queryp

Negative 1987 pI am getting 16 bit signed integers from the I2C bus and store them in a local int16 variable.br The sensor is a MEMS gyroscope and it regularly spikes high or low data values, it seems to be a general problem with many MEMS gyroscopes.  p  pSo normal reading would be 2 to 2, and from time to time depending on my polling rate I get very large values like 30000 or 25000 in between.  p  pI did not find a way to solve that in hardware, I want to solve it in software.

Negative 1987 pLet me rephrase so as to put the pointy end of the question more directly Neo4j worked with Roo at one time maybe not perfectly, but some simple examples published in at least one book apparently did work. strongWhy cant I download the version of Roo that the author used and duplicate the authors resultsstrong p  pA shallow answer, of course, is that strongsoftware dependencies not part of the Roo distribution have changedstrong.p  pA deeper question is, strongWhy does this happen That is, why cant I download the versions of the software providing those dependencies to Roo that were current at the time of the authors writing and expect to be able to duplicate his resultsstrongp  pstrongIts at this point that Im a little stuckstrong and emI cant see why that shouldem be. I dont seem to have any way to be able to identify what those versions might have been. It seems like that ought to be a critical part of Roos configuration management. But, come to think of it, I dont recall this sort of recordkeeping to be part of typical practice except where the RPM package manager is involved. Now, maybe my perceptions as to this point are flat out wrong. But if theyre not doesnt the usual way of doing opensource development need to be upgraded at this point Or maybe Im so completely wrong that strongyou can turn back Roos clockstrong, so to speak. If thats the case, will someone please tell me how to turn it back so that Neo4j works as well as it once did However well or badly that was I dont really care. I just want to replicate results.p  pIs that a better way of expressing and attacking the problem strongIm trying very hard to prop up one of the couple of books written to date about Roostrong. Frankly Id like to see the books authors or publisher wade in and help me or rebut me, because the books still being sold. strongIf the ongoing example is as badly broken as I think it seems to me that it would be wrong to continue selling the bookstrong or, at least, selling it without a clear warning to the reader. OReilly published the book in question and I have a high subjective opinion of their business ethicsa high enough opinion that I wonder if Im getting everything wrong. p  pGenerally when youre wrong, you can depend on 100 people to tell you so plus another 1020 to tell you youre wrong on points that you emdidem get right and another 510 that seize on some basically irrelevant point and contradict you apparently ust fof the fun ot it, without in any way moving the discussion forwarda cooperative concept they seem incapable of grasping let alone following. But I, and others whove asked essentially the same question, hear nothing but the crickets. Chirpchirpp  hr  pmv sorry I wasnt immediately able to find the markup syntax used to notate the ids of members asked a question about the future status of Roos support for Neo4j, which appears to have foundered. A related question puzzlesand frustrates memightily. Neo4j was supported under Roo 1.1.4 but when I try code that apparently worked when 1.1.4 was current from Josh Longs book emGetting Started with Rooem, the code fails in exactly the way it fails under 1.2.5 and the upcoming release, 1.2.6. In other words, it appears that support for Neo4j was removed retroactively, so to speak. p  pMy question follows as a generalization of that observation strongUnder what technical circumstances  I dont wish to consider possible legal reasons would it be good i.e., sound, practical, necessary. ampc. to retroactively alter the behavior of a released version of a software productstrongp  pCurrently, Im finding this decision as respects Roo inconvenient and so I think I may overlook good reasons for such a decision. Please note, however, that my question doesnt specifically pertain to Roo. For one thing, I dont relish a discussion in which participants work to make the Roo team look bad. For another, Im interested in the general case, not merely the particular case of Roo. Actually it seems to me at the moment that the absence of retroactive inconsistencies in behavior is a necessary condition for robust systems. I mean, for example, at exactly what time did the inconsistency begin Was it during or after the stated duration of viability of the release in question. Probably Im wearing my Chicken Little hat but right now it seems to me as though retroactive inconsistency has Humpty Dumpty written all over it. p  pThat being said, I suppose Im sneaking in a second question, but strongI would very much appreciate being told that my premise as respects Roo is inaccurate that is, Neo4j emcanem somehow be used under some appropriately old released version of Roo.strong In that case, I would also be immensely curious to know emhowem this might be accomplished. Roo doesnt require any set up configuration so there appears to be no opportunity for a configuration tweak. Actually the only stated requirements are a JDK and Maven under Linux, OS X, or Windows. But, the strongaddonstrong command apparently queries a database of some sort. Perhaps that is an unstated dependency responsible for retroactively inconsistent Roo behavior.p  pHaving snuck in a second question, Im finding it difficult resisting temptation to go for a third question. If I were to succumb, the question would be this strongHow, in the particular case of Roo, is it possible assuming that the release code has not been surreptitiously changed that the behavior of an old release has been changedstrong It seems to me that the answer must lie in Roos dependencies. But, assuming none of the dependencies has retroactively changed its behavior, can Roo do so without actually modifying the released code It seems to me that it cannot, in which case Id be exceptionally eager to know which dependency assuming there is only one has retroactively changed its behavior, and why. But. I think I may yet find the resources to master even the quite strong temptation to pose that question. p

Negative 1987 pI have a list of functions in a text file that Id like to expose to LLVM for its execution engine at run time, Im wondering if its possible to find pointers to the functions at runtime rather than hard code in all the GlobalMappings by hand as Id probably like to add in more later. For examplep  precode     File InternalFunctions.txt     PushScreen     PopScreen     TopScreen       File ExposeEngine.cpp      Somehow figure out the address of the function specified in a string     void addy  magicAddressPushScreen     jitgtaddGlobalMappingllvmfunction, addy codepre  pIf this is possible I love to know how to do it, as I am trying to write my game engine by jiting c. I was able to create some results earlier, but I had to hardcode in the mappings. I noticed that Gtk uses something along the lines of what Im asking. When you use glade and provide a signal handler, the program you build in c will automatically find the function in your executable referenced by the string provided in the glade file. If getting results requires me to look into this Gtk thing Id be more than happy to, but I dont know what feature or part of the api deals with that  Ive already tried to look it up. Id love to hear suggestions or advice.p

Hence, my server application is able to communicate with clients by different developersvendors, as long as they comply with this welldefined applicationlevel protocol.p  pNow, my server application works fine with 99.9 of the client applications. Nevertheless, I am experiencing strange delays with just a few clients.p  pIn particular, with these problematic clients, once the client connection has been accepted by my server application, the recv calls in my dedicated receiver thread hang for exactly 5 seconds before returning, even though data shall be available, since the client has already completed several send calls.p  pThe clients connecting to my server application run on hosts residing on the same LAN as the host upon which my server application runs.p  pPlease notice the following factsp  p1  With these specific problematic clients, strongALLstrong recv calls in my server application hang for 5 seconds before returning.p  p2  My server application works fine i.e., recv show no relevant delays with other clients actually, the vast majority of them.p  p3  On the other side, those problematic clients seem to work fine i.e., no particular delays with other thirdparty server applications implementing the same applicationlevel protocol as my own server application. Some of those thirdparty server applications are open source Ive inspected the source code of those thirdparty server applications, but I could not find any relevant difference in their implementation which could apparently justify the 5seconds delay that I am experiencing in my server application.p  pI realize that I described the issue in quite generic terms, but maybe this 5 exact seconds delay may tell something to some TCPIP expert...p  pI would really appreciate any hint or suggestion to troubleshoot this problem.p  pThanks in advance and best regards.p

Negative 1987 pGood morning, p  pIm designing an application that be used to conduct surveys. A user will open the application, create a New survey, answer the associated questions, and then receive some output. p  pThe survey is rather convoluted. Basically, the person is going to be answering the same series of questions about each of their family members. Once the questions are complete, the user will allow the application to take all of that information and perform a certain number of calculations and return a result. p  pI have a class, called Survey, which contains properties for the users basic information Name, Email Address, etc. I also have a class called indQuestions, which contains properties that need to have values set for each member of the family Each one will have a height, weight, DOB, income, etc. Based on the size of the family, the Survey instance will have any number of instances of indQuestions. p  pNow, I have to create a single instance of Survey when a new survey is created, but that instance of Survey has to contain X number of instances of indQuestions, and multiple Surveys need to be created based on whether the user wants to do a second survey, change answers to compare returned values, etc for whatever reason. p  pMy application contains many UIViewControllers, since the survey is long and not everything can fit on one page, but the survey is cumulative, and it requires me to be able to access information on each UIViewController that was entered in previous UIViewControllers. p  pI considered creating a Singleton instance of my Survey class, but ultimately, there has to be multiple instances of Survey, since the customer may opt to do the survey multiple times. Also, the customer has to be able to add an unknown number of instances of indQuestions to accommodate the size of the family. Ive been wracking my brain trying to figure out how to find a way to both make a single instance of Survey and its associated values available across multiple views while also allowing for the dynamic creation of multiple family members. p  pI would appreciate any guidance that you can provide. I dont know how to progress with this.p  pFollow up  Okay, so I assume Id use the following instance to create a new survey p  precode instancetypestartNewSurvey    static Survey instance   static dispatchoncet onceToken   dispatchonceamponceToken,      instance  [[Survey alloc] init]      return instance  end codepre  pWould I then use the activateSurvey method to pass the startNewSurvey instance into activeSurvey Im trying to follow the logic. p

Negative 1987 pIm just becoming familiar with AudioUnit and am trying to figure out a crash that occurs during an AURenderCallback on a build for arm64 running on iPad Air.

Is there some reason for this, or is it just an artifact of the historical posix standardp  pIs there, ever, a situation where codeOAPPENDcode  codeORDONLYcode is a valid combinationp

Basically, the key thing is that the way how glm defines matrix is different from our conventional way. codeglmmat4x3 matcode will actually create a 3 by 4 matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns. And if you access by codemat[i]code it will return you the ith column instead of the ith row.p

Negative 1987 pIm using php amp mysql with a pinch of javascript.  This is a simple edit form, that autofills the various elements from data in a table.

Negative 1987 pI am proposing an idea for a final year project that is basically a virtual environment. I would be using Citrix XenServer in conjunction with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Citrix netscaler to make the server accessible over the web. I would also be hosting a website on the server that Windows is on. p  pWhat I was wondering is, would it be possible to trigger the execution of a script on the server from the web page. So basically a user comes along, goes to my website, registers their details. a csv file is then produced based on the details that are input. Then I was wondering is there a way to trigger the execution of a powershell script that would use the csv file to set up the user in Active directory. The powershell script itself is simple its just how I would get it to run is another thing. p

Negative 1987 pUsing the jQuery a hrefhttpmmenu.frebsite.nl relnofollowmmenu plugina I need to call a JavaScript function after the menu has finished opening.  I cant see from the a hrefhttpmmenu.frebsite.nldocumentationapi.html relnofollowAPI documentationa how to do this using the plugin API, so Im thinking perhaps the only option is to observe the class name on the codelthtmlgtcode element, which gains a class of codemmopenedcode when the menu is opened.  This feels a little hacky though, so I wondered if anyone could see a way, within the bounds of the native API, to accomplish the required function callp  pEDIT Contrary to expectations the codeopenPanelcode event doesnt fire when the menu is opened  it only fires when submenus are opened, so although this suggests it would do the job, it doesnt.p  pMany thanks.p
Negative 1987 pI would like to make nested asynchronous calls. I would like to perform one async call before I make a 2nd async call. The 1st async call will dictate what parameters or actions to take with the 2nd async call.p  pHeres the original async callp  precodedef renderparam1String  Action.async  request gt   implicit val ctx  RequestContext.createFromRequestrequest   Page.loadparam1, request.map        case PageType1title gt         Okviews.html.mainpageType1, title       case PageType2title gt         Okviews.html.mainpageType2, title     codepre  pThe async I would like to perform before the Page.load async call would asynchronously validate the signed in users info. If the user is not signed in, then an unauthenticated anonymous token is created. This info needs to be written to an array of cookies which is the return value of the async getAuthCookies method, see sample code below. These cookies need to be added to the Ok method using the withCookies method. Eventually I could also change the flow of the code depending on what info is gathered in the getAuthCookies method so a user signin page is created if the users session has expired. This is probably more background info on the code that is necessary, but hopefully the general code examples are good enough to give you an idea of what I am trying to do.p  pSee below for the async call to the getAuthCookies method p  precode  ...   implicit val ctx  RequestContext.createFromRequestrequest   for        cookies lt Authenticator.getAuthCookiesrequest     yield       Placing Page.load here doesnt work. It produces a type mismatch err      ... codepre  pIve tried to place the Page.load code within the yield statement, but it produces a type mismatch error within the more general render method.p  pHow can I ensure the the Page.load async method is called after the Authenticator.getAuthCookies async method but ensure a type mismatch error is not producedp

Negative 1987 pImagine a webapp where the entire user experience would be served using a websocket not hard to do these days. This would mean that a client connects to a websocket in tomcat then a controller would take care of each request over the TCP connection. p  pMy main concern is that such approach would be quite heavy in terms of resources. Each client would have a TCP connection open for a quite long period of time keeping the controller and its resources in memory for the same amount of time. Even assuming that the controller is really well designed in terms of GC, it seems to me that it would reduce the amount of traffic each server will be able to serve.p  pOn the other hand, I can see solutions like MeteorJS I dont like MeteorNodeJS that work exactly this way. Am I missing somethingp  pThanksp

The way the apps work is that a login is passed to the hapi.js service via the angular frontend, if the usernamepassword checks are good, then a user object is returned to write into the codesession.auth.credentialscode. Once the codehapiauthcode plugin writes the cookie, the angular.js app then uses the value of that cookie a random API token generated that is tied to the user who logged in to send in the codeAuthorizationcode header.p  pThe codehapi.jscode app uses that codeAuthorizationcode token value to make sure the auth hand shake is good to go.p  pMy question is that the generated API token is generated using the npm module codehatcode, is it enough to just allow a random generated API token to be used for authentication or should there be some kind of salting involvedp

Negative 1987 pIm new to the charting functions in .NETs codeSystem.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Chartingcode library. During my exploratory prototyping, I created a chart to which I can add random points, change the chart type, etc. But I noticed that every time I add more than 34998 points to the chart regardless of which type of chart type I use, the entire chart disappears and is replaced with a big X. No exception is thrown, and it doesnt appear to be a limitation of the point collection itself. If I step through the code when adding the 34999th point, it gets added to the collecion just fine but as soon as the chart gets repainted, it immediately gets replaced with the X.p  pI realize that this is a large number of points to have on a chart in the first place, and I plan to look at some decimation techniques to downsample my input data. But I was just wondering if there is a hard limit at this number, and which module in the system is the actual constraint dataset, drawing canvas, etc. I couldnt find any mention of it in a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryvstudioDd456769vvs.110.aspxthe documentationa. Does anyone know of such a limitp
Negative 1987 pSo I have an ASP.NET MVC 5 app with ASP.NET Identity 2.0 running.  Everything is pretty okay, but I want to refactor my code and I am wondering what alternatives exist to my current implementation.  Let me explain.p  pI have the Controllers in the root of my project as well as many in the Areas folder of the project.

What Im imagining is having custom utility methods for each DbSet in codeMyDbContextcode but Im not sure how to do that.  Something like the following would be idealp  precodeSemester thisSemester  db.Semesters.GetCurrentSemester codepre  porp  precodeSelectList semesters  db.Semesters.GetAllSemestersAsSelectList codepre  pwhere codeSemesterscode is of type codeDbSetltSemestergtcode in both examples.p  pCan anyone offer a solutionp

Negative 1987 pBelieve me, I have read all the other questions on this topic. None of them solved my problem or were even quite the same problem. Facebook login has been working perfectly fine for me for weeks... Until yesterday when suddenly it started breaking and giving me this error. p  pBefore yesterday, when I logged into my app with the Facebook SDK codelogInWithReadPermissionscode method, it would say Youve already authorized [app name] and be perfectly happy to log me in and move on. Then suddenly it started failing with this errorp  blockquote   pGiven URL is not allowed by the Application configuration One or more of the given URLs is not allowed by the Apps settings. To use this URL you must add a valid native platform in your Apps settings.p blockquote  pThe weird part is I hadnt changed any of the Facebook apps settings at all. This just suddenly started happening five minutes before it worked, next build it didnt. Nevertheless, I looked up the error message and found a ton of things people suggested to do on the facebook developer page to fix the problem... Mostly involving the codeValid OAuth redirect URIscode field, not that I could quite get a clear answer of what youre supposed to put in there for strongan iOS appstrong... They always said to put your website address. I dont have a website, I have an app... What givesp  pSo I knew I hadnt made any changes to the Facebook developer area to cause it to break, and Id tried every change there that I could find on the internet. So I pulled down an old working copy to test that, on the off chance that somehow code Id written was the problem. Nope code from a week ago, that worked perfectly fine, still gives me the same message.p  pIf the problem isnt in the code, and changing things on the FB site doesnt do it... Im out of ideas. If theres something else I need to do on the FB app to fix this, suggest away and Ill give it a try... And if it works thats great, but Im still not going to understand why it broke in the first place when I didnt make any changes... Anybody able to help me outp

It is my understanding that I have to convert the codestrcode type into an codeintcode type before doing any math on it, yet it looks like that is where it is failing.p  pI tested the codehappyornotcode function by itself, and it does print out the value that I expect it to. It seems like to me that the issue comes when I try and call that codehappyornotcode function inside of the codehappynumbercheckcode function, which is reading my txt file containing a list of numbers to test. I must not be grasping a larger principle here, so any explanations would be helpful. p  pThis is also my first real attempt at a recursive function and there probably is a better way to structure this, so any suggestions on how to change things up to be more effective is most welcome.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1987 ul listrongWhat I want to dostrong Extract basic biographic information from a text document. Relation Extraction to be specificli listrongExplanationstrong I have n text documents containing biographies of n different people. I want to extract information corresponding to their names, age, qualifications, affiliations and interests.li listrongWhat I was able to dostrong I used Stanford NER to extract name, age and organization in some cases. However, there were many False Positives as well as False Negativesspecially for organization tag.li listrongWhy is it difficultstrong As it is a biographic document, it contains text associated with the concerned person. I cant use the other documents for training my classifier as things will be totally different for another person. Yes, I surely can write some rules. However, that is restricting my domain considerably. For example, I wrote rules to extract qualification..simple ones being if any of the degrees in my prespecified dictionary is present in a sentence, I can extract entities from that sentence and try to find a relation. li listrongMy questionstrong Is there any way of making this task automatic Since we are analyzing just one document each time, please dont suggest me to use bootstrapping based approaches. I tried learning patterns from collecting specific sentences from each document and then applying bootstrapbased algorithms like Snowball, but failed miserably. I am aware that parsing might help me over here, I am trying to learn some patterns from the dependency parse of specific sentences..however I am not really sure how to proceed with it. I thought of applying distant supervision learning, however that too requires a large dataset.li listrongPersonal Take till nowstrong Such problem could be solved by rulebased approaches augmented by parsingbased methods.
