Positive 7346 pI work on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile WUP, and i try to apply the same code logic to do same function in both plataforms.p  pI have ContentDialog, and is expected when I am in a popup desktop appears in the center of the screen with a maximum size 480 px tall. and when Im in the mobile version width lt1024 want this dialog occupies the whole screen. To do this I had to do to override the style ContentDialog and applies it only when is mobile version. However, when Im on the desktop but with the app in a size less than 1024px, ContentDialog is aligned at the top and does not take up the whole screen, but when Im on the Desktop version width  1024 px and Lowering it to the app window to less than 1024px the ContentDialog fits to the whole screen. This problem only happens when the open for the first time. This only appear if I put this.MaxHeight  1024 in code behind otherwise ContentDialog not occuped all screenp  pIt gives the feeling that you are applying any size property that is no sword.p

Positive 7346 pIm looking for a CSSJQuery method of keeping a DIV which contains navigation buttons visible when scrolling or content extends the viewable window size.p  pI have come across CSS code like this p  precode.element  positionfixed Bottom0px  codepre  pBut my request is for use within a pop up window  dialog and this code doesnt seem to work for my scenario. I have a pop up window which displays a next and previous button at the bottom and each page is a fieldset which is animated in or out of view.  There are a few fieldsets which go beyond the height of the pop up window and so the scroll activates. But I want to keep my button DIV in view at all times, along the bottom of the pop up window.p  pTrying to use the CSS above does not seem to set the element within the pop up window, rather it is positioning based on the parent window.p  pIs there a way to create a fixed DIV to remain visible when scrolling within a pop up windowp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT  Code for the

I have tried manipulating the styles width and height but the problem continues.p  pThis is when I drill down the first time a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comj97AD.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj97AD.png altenter image description hereap  pThis is when I drill down from the 2nd time onwardsp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.combxDE6.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combxDE6.png alt2nd timeap  pReport Viewp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srchttpswww.google.comjsapigtltscriptgt                     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt                         google.loadvisualization, 1.1,  packages [bar]                          google.setOnLoadCallbackdrawChart                         function drawChart                              var data1  google.visualization.arrayToDataTable[                               [Faculty Name, Book, Book Chapter, Journal Article, Conference],                                Html.Rawrows]                             var options                                   title                                                           var chart  new google.charts.Bardocument.getElementByIdcolumnchartmaterial                             chart.drawdata1, options                               var options2                                   title Submissions per School,                                 width 800,                                 height 500,                                 vAxis                                                            var chart2  new google.charts.Bardocument.getElementByIdcolumnchartmaterial2                             google.visualization.events.addListenerchart, select, function                                   var row1  chart.getSelection[0].row                                 var facultyName  data1.getValuerow1, 0                                 var str                                 var str1                                 jQuery.ajax                                     type GET,                                     url GetSchool2,                                     data FacultyName  facultyName,                                     dataType json,                                     success function data                                          str1  document.getElementByIddetails.innerHTML.trim                                         alertstr1                                         str  data                                         alertstr                                         alertJSON.parse[  str  ]                                         jQuerydetails.appendstr                                         var data2  new google.visualization.DataTable                                         data2.addColumnstring, School                                         data2.addColumnnumber, Book                                         data2.addColumnnumber, Book Chapter                                         data2.addColumnnumber, Journal Article                                         data2.addColumnnumber, Conference                                         data2.addRowsJSON.parse[  str  ]                                         chart2.drawdata2, options2                                     ,                                     error function XMLHttpRequest, textstatus, error                                          alerterror                                                                                                       myModal.modalshow                                                                           ltscriptgt                     ltdiv idcolumnchartmaterial stylewidth 800px height 500pxgtltdivgt                       ltdiv idmyModal classmodal fade roledialog tabindex1 arialabelledbymyModalLabel ariahiddentrue styledisplaynonegt                         ltdiv classmodaldialog modallggt                             lt Modal contentgt                             ltdiv classmodalcontentgt                                 ltdiv classmodalheadergt                                     ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissmodalgtamptimesltbuttongt                                     lth4 classmodaltitlegtSubmissions by Schoollth4gt                                 ltdivgt                                 ltdiv class modalbodygt                                     ltdiv idcolumnchartmaterial2 stylewidth 800px height 500pxgtltdivgt                                 ltdivgt                                 ltdiv classmodalfootergt                                     ltbutton typebutton classbtn btndefault datadismissmodalgtCloseltbuttongt                                 ltdivgt                             ltdivgt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt codepre  pI cannot figure out why the axis change and why the key on the left changes.

Positive 7346 pI am not sure what is going wrong here, so please help me SO God p  pI am setting up a hrefhttpdimsemenov.compluginsmagnificpopup relnofollowMagnificPopupa within a Meteors application, so it responds to clicks on the code.popuptriggercode classed links, as follows p  precode  POPUPS   L.PCONT.magnificPopup     delegate   a.popuptrigger,      type       inline,     prependTo  pagecontent, That is where Meteor puts his    codepre  pHere is an exemple of some template implementing a code.popuptriggercode link, which is working great, meaning that the popup triggers correctly  p  precodelttemplate namebookinggt    ltpgt I have a lta classpopuptrigger hrefpromocodegt promocodeltagtltpgt    ltdiv idpromocode classmfphidegt     lth1gt Voucherlth1gt      ltform idpromocodeformgt       ltinput typetext namepromocode placeholder Promocodegt       ltinput idcancel typesubmit namecancel value Cancelgt       ltinput typesubmit namesubmit value Submitgt     ltformgt   ltdivgt lttemplategt codepre  pYou may have noticed the codeprependTo  pagecontentcode option I am passing to codemagnificPopupcode.

My understanding is that events coming from the popup should still bubble up until reaching codepagecontentcode, and be caught by Meteors event listeners. p  pI should add that if I dont enclose the form within a magnificPopup, the events are caught properly by Meteor. Any explanation as to why this is not happening Any suggestion is most welcome, really. p  pIn the meantime, Ill have to bypass Meteors logic to set up popups listeners. p

Negative 7346 pMy current preferred C environment is the free and largely excellent Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Express edition. From time to time I have sent release .exe files to other people with pleasing results. However recently I made the disturbing discovery that the pleasing results were based on more luck that I would like. Attempting to run one of these programs on an old 2001 vintage, not scrupulously updated XP box gave me nothing but a nasty System cannot run x.exe or similar message.p  pSome googling revealed that with this toolset, even specifying static linking results in a simple helloworld.exe actually relying on extra .dll files msvcm80.dll etc.. An incredibly elaborate version scheming system manifest files anyone then will not let the .exe run without exactly the right .dll versions. I dont want or need this stuff, I just want an old fashioned self contained .exe that does nothing but lowest common denominator Win32 operations and runs on any old win32 OS.p  pDoes anyone know if its possible to do what I want to do with my existing toolset p  pThank you.p

Negative 7346 pWe have a C application that connects to a FTP server, downloads some files, disconnects, and after a certain amount of time selected by the user through the UI reconnects and repeats the process. We implemented this using BackgroundWorker, but we noticed that after running for a longer time, the program stopped logging its actions, both in the UI and the log file. At that point, there were no files for it to download, so we uploaded some and it resumed activity as if nothing had happened. p  pThe problem was that the regular users had no way of knowing that the program was still working, so we decided to implement it using our own threading. We did a simpler program, to rule out any other problems, and this one only connects to the FTP and disconnects.

Negative 7346 pI have an automated test framework for testing hardware widgets. Right now only passfail results of test cases are stored into a relational database using hibernate. Id like to change this so that various characteristics of the test are stored in the database. e.g. how many gerbils are running inside the widget, the inputs to various assertions in the tests, etc.. p  pEach test case is represented as a Java class, so the first thing I thought of was using hibernate to just create a table for each test case. However, we have lots and lots of test cases so I dont think that having a table for each test case is necessarily the best idea. p  pThe amount and type of data for specific test cases will not change on different executions of the test case, but the data needed for each test case will be dramatically different. To use a silly example for the gerbilgnawing test we always want to record the age and color of the gerbils gnawing at the wires, but for the smash test we only need to record how many rocks were thrown at the widget.p  pIdeally we would be able to query this information from the database using SQL so the data cant be stored as binary blobs or other unqueryable entities.p  pAny ideas on how to structure the database to meet these requirements Am I totally offbase on not wanting a large number of tablesp

Negative 7346 pI have a situation where I need to notify some users when something in DB changes. My idea is to catch codepresavecode and codepostsavecode signal and make some kind of diff and mail that. Generally it works good, but I dont know how to get diff for m2m fields. p  pAt the moment I have something like thisp  precodedef presavesender, kwargs     pk  kwargs[instance].pk     instance  copy.deepcopysender.objects.getpkpk     tracking[sender]  instance  def postsavesender, kwargs     instance  copy.deepcopykwargs[instance]     print diffinstance, tracking[sender]  TODO dont print, save diff somewhere codepre  pDiff function should work for every model at the mommet I have four model classes. With deepcopy I can save old model, but I dont know how to save m2m fields because they are in separate table yes, I know I can get this data, but at the momment of execution I dont know what fields are m2m and I wouldnt like to create different slot for every model. What I would like is generic solution, so I can just add models later without thinking about notification part. p  pMy plan is to call codegetdatacode and codecleardatacode functions after codesavecode in view to clean diff that slots have generated.p  pIs this good way of doing this Is there a better way Is there django application that can do this job for mep  pExcuse my English, its not my native language.p

Negative 7346 pI am on Windows 7, using IE8 and Visual Studio 2005. I have been enjoying the built in javascript debugger in IE8 for several months. About 2 weeks ago, I installed some security update for IE 8 possibly KB978207 and all of a sudden the javascript debugger is now broken. p  pIf I get a warning from IE 8 that an error occurred and asking if I want to debug using the built in debugger, if I hit yes, I get a grey popup in the top left corner which Ive never seen before saying JScript Debugger. Breaking on JScript runtime error  Object doesnt support this property or method. Then nothing happens. IE freezes up and then I get a Windows popup saying that IE 8 is no longer responding and asking if I want to end this process. If I try to end the process, nothing happens and I continue to get the grey popup. I usually have to kill debugging process from VS 2005, but the frozen IE8 still is present. Its not until later when the OS, finally cleans up the process that it will go away...p  pstrongEdit new infostrongp  pI tried removing the lastest security update and a silverlight update that came around the same time, but Windows automatically reinstalled them....p  pI then tried removing IE 8, and then adding it back to my system to reset anything related to IE8. This did not have any effect. p  pAfter reinstalling IE8, I did notice that, when I first tried to open the developer tools window by hitting F12 from a regular IE 8 window, I never saw anything, but I could see the developer tools title in the task manager list. I had to right click on the task and maximize the window, so I could actually see the developer tools window. Apparently this is a bug mentioned here a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSiewebdevelopmentthread79b8ee54c5f64467ba6d27491c95cd13 relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSiewebdevelopmentthread79b8ee54c5f64467ba6d27491c95cd13ap  pIve realized that the window will maximize if the iexplorer.exe process is not the debugged process launched from VS2005. p  pThe grey popup I mentioned in my original post is from the developer tools window iexplorer.exe process.p  pIf I launch my app from VS2005 and then hit F12, I see that the developer tools window is opened I can see that window is opened under the IE icon in my taskbar, but it is not shown. If I try to maximize it from the task manager, this has no effect. p  pSo basically, the developer tools window is freezing up when it tries to open under my debugged iexplorer.exe process launched from VS2005. The OS then asks if I want to kill the process since its not responding, but it is unable to kill it. At some later point, the zombie iexplorer.exe process is killed succesfully by the OS I presume.p

Negative 7346 pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pWell Ive refactored the workaround that I have into a separate function. This way, while its still not ideal especially since I have to free outside the function the memory that is allocated inside the function, it does afford the ability to use it a little more generally. Im still hoping for a more optimal and elegant solution br br br  strongUpdatestrongp  pOkay, so the emreasonem for the problem has been established, but Im still at a loss for a solution.p  pI am trying to figure out an easyeffective way to modify a few bytes of an array in a struct. My current workaround of dynamically allocating a buffer of equal size, copying the array, making the changes to the buffer, using the buffer in place of the array, then releasing the buffer seems excessive and lessthan optimal. If I have to do it this way, I may as well just put two arrays in the struct and initialize them both to the same data, making the changes in the second. My goal is to reduce both the memory footprint store just the differences between the original and modified arrays, and the amount of manual work automatically patch the array. br br br  strongOriginal poststrongp  pI wrote a program last night that worked just fine but when I refactored it today to make it more extensible, I ended up with a problem.p  pThe original version had a hardcoded array of bytes. After some processing, some bytes were written into the array and then some more processing was done.p  pTo avoid hardcoding the pattern, I put the array in a structure so that I could add some related data and create an array of them. However now, I cannot write to the array in the structure. Heres a pseudocode examplep  precodemain    char pattern[]x32x33x12x13xbaxbb   PrintDatapattern   pattern[2]x65   PrintDatapattern  codepre  pThat one works but this one does notp  precodestruct ENTRY    char pattern   int   somenum   main    ENTRY Entries[]         x32x33x12x13xbaxbbx9axbc, 44     , x12x34x56x78, 555      PrintDataEntries[0].pattern   Entries[0].pattern[2]x65   0xC0000005 exception    PrintDataEntries[0].pattern  codepre  pThe second version causes an access violation exception on the assignment. Im sure its because the second version allocates memory differently, but Im starting to get a headache trying to figure out whats what or how to get fix this. Im currently working around it by dynamically allocating a buffer of the same size as the pattern array, copying the pattern to the new buffer, making the changes to the buffer, using the buffer in the place of the pattern array, and then trying to remember to free thetemporarybuffer.p  pSpecifically, the original version cast the pattern arrayoffsetto a DWORD and assigned a DWORD constant to it to overwrite the four target bytes. The new version cannot do that since the length of the source is unknownmay not be four bytesso it uses memcpy instead. Ive checked and rechecked and have made sure that the pointers to memcpy are correct, but I still get an access violation. I use memcpy instead of strncpy because I am using plain chars as an array of bytes, not Unicode chars and ignoring the nullterminator. Using an assignment as above causes the same problem.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 7346 pIm really struggling with a choice between the GWT Tree widget, which has been a part of GWT for ages or the new CellTree, which is introduced by GWT 2.1.p  pThe tree I want to present to the user is not particularly large, but I am very concerned about responsiveness.p  pThe data at the nodes of the tree will be editable. By clicking on a node, the user will put the node into edit mode. Editing the more simple nodes will require only a single TextBox or TextArea but others will involve several widgets, over which I want styling control via CSS.p  pIm attracted to the CellTree approach because it seems to offer great flexibility and speed however, the sample code for CellTree editing deals with only very simple data types string, date, integer, etc. I dont know if CellTree is appropriate when youve got more complex nodeediting needs.p  pWhat do you think Is CellTree the best approach Does CellTree replace Tree in general What heuristics can I apply in choosing between themp

For the purposes of working this through, the LambdaExpression takes an XmlNode and returns an object. It must return an object, the real return type could be any of DateTime,bool,int,decimal,XmlDocument [so far] The general idea is that somewhere deep in a parser, this lambda is created and it extracts a value from its input parameter and returns it typed, but boxed in an object.p  precode     XmlNode node  null        ParameterExpression instanceExpression  Expression.ParametertypeofDynamicNode, instance        ParameterExpression result  Expression.Parametertypeofobject, result        LabelTarget blockReturnLabel  Expression.Labeltypeofobject        BlockExpression block  Expression.Block                              typeofobject,                              new[]   result ,                              Expression.Assignresult, Expression.ConvertExpression.ConstantDateTime.Now.AddSeconds1, typeofobject,                              Expression.ReturnblockReturnLabel, result,                              Expression.LabelblockReturnLabel, Expression.Constant2, typeofobject LambdaExpression lax  Expression.LambdaltFuncltXmlNode, objectgtgtblock, instanceExpression codepre  pLater in the code, were evaluating lt, lt, , ,  and  so we want to compare the result of this LambdaExpression to another Expressionp  pUsually, we can assume the LambdaExpression is on the left of the Expression.LessThan on the right, could be pretty much any expression, but lets assume its typed. That means that it could be ConstantExpression or similar... but it has a type.p  pThis means that Expression.LessThan [for example] fails because the LambdaExpression when Expression.Invoke is called on it returns an object and the RHS is whatever that type is.p  pAssuming that the type boxed inside the object returned from the LambdaExpression is actually comparable to the type on the right hand side e.g.p  precodeobject5 lt 6 codepre  pHow do I write an expression that can compare the boxed type to the unboxed type without crashing Ive tried various permutations in linqpad, including trying to write this in normal c i.e. no Expressions, just nested ifthenelse however I couldnt get that working quite right.

This works but when I have destroyed the widget once, I cant get it to appear again.

Negative 7346 pIm driving myself mad trying to modify a piece of php code provided to me by my shopping cart developer as they are currently very busy, but unfortunately I have no experience with php, as Ive only ever dealt with html before. The code is designed to call the database of products upon an item being added to the cart in order to remove one from the backend inventory. p  pThe code I began with is thisp  precodeltphp HTML    Get all specific result from the inventory table result  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM inventory WHERE catagorycatname or diemysqlerror   whilerow  mysqlfetcharrayresult     ifrow[instock]  0  HTML . ltltlt eof ltoption costrow[listPrice] idnumrow[itemid] namerow[itemName]gtrow[description]ltoptiongt eof   echo HTML   gt codepre  pHowever, I dont want customers to be able to add items to cart if the instock number is 0 or less because we wont have any to sell With my limited understanding and some research, I think I need to add an else or elseif statement somewhere in here, along the lines ofp  precodeelseifrow[instock] lt 0  echo Sorry this item is out of stock.  codepre  pHowever, wherever I seem to put it I always end up with a syntax error whenever I try to run the script. I have tried to figure out how all the braces work and HTML but Im totally lost p  pIm also wondering if I need something extra in there since each item has a textentry quantity box that is completed before the items are added to the cart, so I think something might be needed to be added so that if a customer enters a number in the box that is more than is in stock and clicks add to cart, theyll have some kind of popup to tell them theyve chosen more than is currently available. If so, Id love some advice on how to do this alsop  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7346 pEver since ChromiumNative Client have switched to using PPAPI 2, obtaining a 3D context is broken. I can link and compile my application which uses OpenGL ES 2 extensively, everything works ... except obtaining a 3D context to draw on. My problems are exactly the same as in this a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comgroupnativeclientdiscussbrowsethreadthread67cc0906801cb1b4 relnofollowML posta. This problem exists at least with NaCl SDK 2, and 3, both with chrome 11, and 12. Now I know because of the API changes, gl is simply not supported at the moment. However, I believe there are other projects actively working on 3D ports to NaCl ex. a hrefhttpblogs.unity3d.com20110602notesonnativeclientpepperpluginapi20Unity relnofollowUnitya, and I assume they have some kludge to obtain the context. Of course it is also possible that they are developing with an old version of ChromeNaCl, or that they have put development on hold until the API catches up.p  pBasically, my question is, is there any kludge I can use to obtain the 3D context to use with opengl es 2p
Negative 7346 pI currently develop an application that creates polygons from lines and I experience a small problemp  pI have a set of points, representing a line. I would like to create a polygon that displays the line with a specific width e.g. for a street. I have several ideas how to calculate the outer polygon points, but I think they are too complicated...p  pMy best idea was the one pictured below Every point of the line must be projected to at least two points Both points must be 90 to the following line segment and have a distance half of the preferred polygon width.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkWm2J.png altHighway rendering width problemp  pThis works good, as you can see at the end and start points of the pictured polygon. Now the complicated part With this method, at a corner, each point gets four points. But these points are not correct for the outer polygon, because they are in the shape. The lines intersected and created an ugly polygon.p  pHow can I find the correct points for such a polygon I think my method is far too complicated for solving this problem.p  pCan anybody help me with this propably very common problemp  pemInfoem I tagged this with codeopenstreetmapcode because renderer like Mapnik have this problem, too.p

Browsing the directory clearly shows that the new file is there. The filenames were prepended with a forward slash as in myFile.txt.p  pThe codeClassLoadercode version of codegetResourcecode on the other hand did find the generated file. From this experience it seems that there is some kind of caching of the directory listing going on.

If we have rows of data though, this simply will not work as everything will have different margins.p  pYes, We could just say Images will not be bigger then x so lets float the image left and set a left margin on the right side content.  or even float the content on the right to the right.p  pDoing this really isnt a problem, however I am just curious as if there was a way to make it all fluid... Some of these sites im working on have enormous stylesheets and Im trying to keep the styles to a minimum.p  pOur designer likes to use this image to the left, content to the right  or even reversed... image to the right content to the left A LOT. But it seems as the margins are always different per situation. I really want to make this a reuseable class.p  pThanks for you help p

Negative 7346 pI need to create a few tests for the user roles in a web application. To minimize the description, one of the tests involves checking if a menu entry is displayed or not for an user.p  pFor this test, I use a table called UserRoles, that looks like thisp  precodesUserName    bDoesntHaveMenuX User1        1 User2        0 User3        1 codepre  pbDoesntHaveMenuX is of type bit.p  pI have a class derived from ValidationRule that checks if a certain text is present in a page, based on a XPath expression to locate the node where to look for the text. The public properties of this class arep  precodestring XPathExpression string Text bool FailIfFound codepre  pThe last one dictates if the rule should fail if the text is found or not found.p  pIn the test I added a datasource for the table mentioned in the beginning, called DS.  For the request Im interested in I added a new instance of my validation rule class, with the following valuesp  precodeTextMenuX XPathExpressiondiv[idmenu]td FailIfFoundDS.UserRoles.bDoesntHaveMenuX codepre  pUnfortunately, this doesnt work. The reason seems to be that the data binding process creates a context variable DS.UserRoles.bDoesntHaveMenuX has the value False or True. The value is a string, so the binding results in a casting error.p  pMy options, as far as I can think of, arep  ol liChange the validation rule to accept strings for FailIfFound. Not a valid option, for 2 reasons its a hack and the same rule is used in other places.li liMake a new validation rule that will use the above mentioned one, and implement the FailIfFound as string. I also dont like this, for the same reason as above. Its a hack.li liMake the test coded and do the proper cast before passing the data to the validation rule. I dont like this one because I prefer to have the test as coded only if there is no other way.li ol  pWhich brings me to the question. Is there another wayp  pThank you.p

Negative 7346 pIm using a dependency property which handles the fadein  fadeout of a Framework Element. p  pThe property is able to handle the fadein  fadeout animation by registering callback methods for whenever the Visibility property of the animated element has changed.p  pThis was done by the previous coder as suchp  precodeUIElement.VisibilityProperty.AddOwnertypeof FrameworkElement, new FrameworkPropertyMetadataVisibility.Visible, VisibilityChanged,                                                                           CoerceVisibility codepre  pThe problem here is that FrameworkElement is already an owner of the VisibilityProperty, and as such triggers an exception which was catched luckily by ExpressionBlend.p  pTo counter this problem, I noticed that Dependency Properties have a OverwriteMetadata method, which allows someone to overwrite the metadata of a given type, in my case FrameworkElement.p  pAs such, I could use the following insteadp  precodeUIElement.VisibilityProperty.OverrideMetadatatypeofFrameworkElement, new FrameworkPropertyMetadataVisibility.Visible, VisibilityChanged, CoerceVisibility codepre  pMy question is p  pHow safe is it to overwrite FrameworkElements Visibilitys metadata  If its unsafe, what other alternatives do I have p  pEDIT Well, scratch that...

Negative 7346 pIm working on a pretty complicated app right now, but I just got a really good, niche market idea for an AR game for iPhone.

Negative 7346 pIm trying to produce a little html5 animation for a family member A river with flowing paragraphs. This is actually nowhere professional. Wed just like to know what is possible with html5. p  pThe setup is as following We have a canvas and a javascript file named painter.js. The script has two jobs display and move the paragraphs and render someting like water.p  pThe paragraphs are rather straightforward simple png images that are stretched and moved from one side to the other.p  pThe water however is problematic. My idea was to create a path and fill it with a gradient that slowly goes from brightblue to darkblue  black. Heres some code, please note p  pThis code comes from inside the function water which is called repeatedly before the paragraphs are rendered and after the canvas has been cleared. The canvas has a width of 400px and a height of 500px. There should be waves on the surface of the river, thus the calls to quadraticCurveTo. waterlevel stays constant  I wanted to play with it, therefore its a variable. wavesize however is modified with every execution. This is not the entire function water Ive spared you the tedious part about in or decreasing wavesize.p  precodecontext.beginPath  context.moveTo0,waterlevel context.quadraticCurveTo50,waterlevelwavesize,100,waterlevel context.moveTo100,waterlevel context.quadraticCurveTo150,waterlevelwavesize,200,waterlevel context.moveTo200,waterlevel context.quadraticCurveTo250,waterlevelwavesize,300,waterlevel context.moveTo300,waterlevel context.quadraticCurveTo350,waterlevelwavesize,400,waterlevel context.moveTo400,waterlevel context.quadraticCurveTo450,waterlevelwavesize,500,waterlevel context.moveTo500,waterlevel context.lineTo500,400 context.moveTo500,400 context.lineTo0,400 context.moveTo0,400 context.lineTo0,150 context.moveTo0,150  context.fillStylemygradient context.fill codepre  pAs opposed to my intentions the result is thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI6jS0.png altrendering the waves with fillp  pMy first idea was that the path was messed up but replacing context.fill with context.stroke shows thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKzZyf.png altoutlining the river with strokep  pCan you help me Any idea how to fill a custom path with a custom gradient  If you have a link or sample code, Id be glad.p  pThank you for your timep

Negative 7346 pI am a ruby on rails newbie and developing a rails 3.1 app which includes tabulous gem with twitterbootstrap and formtasticbootstrap gems.p  pI have a control panel in my application under a namespaced area.p  pUnder the namespaced area in the views directory, I have a control panel directory with view pages underneath it that dont correspond to any controller actions except 1 view page that relates to a controller called controlpanelcontroller.rb action called control panel which serves as the main page of the control panel.p  pdirectory structures are as followsp  pappcontrollersmanagercontrolpanelcontroller.rbp  pappviewsmanagercontrolpanelcontrolpanel.html.erbp  pappviewsmanagercontrolpanelproject.html.erbp  pappviewsmanagercontrolpanelgraphs.html.erbp  pI believe what I am trying to do is simple, I have created a nav menu which links to the different views under this control panel directory and what I want is to display tabs in one of the viewsproject.html.erb when a user clicks a link in the nav menu labeled project.p  pThe problem I have managed to implement the tabs I require which map to different controller actions and show in the view but upon clicking on a tab, the tabulous gem is not rendering the action views on the same page but instead linking me to another page. So basically the tabs disappear and I am routed to the controller view action of the tab I will have clicked on as opposed to being kept on the same page.

Negative 7346 pI ran different tests recently on a .net app to see how memory footprint could be kept down. I came across various tipsguidelines like disposing unmanaged resources, unregistering events, using FREEZE on xaml resources etc. which all made sense. Most of the things were already taken care of , so the memory consumption remained same. I figured out however, that each new window which is never opened before in the current run, will consume some more memory and never seem to return it back after you close the window.p  pSo I ran GC.Collectright after the window close  for debugging purpose but with no success.p  pIn the app were a few windows with AllowsTransparencytrue , so I removed the attribute and saw a big memory difference, approx.. 5MB less, but whatever memory the window took now was still not released after the window was closed, so the problem remained the same.  Here is the sample p  pC  p  precodeWindow w bool isWindowOpen  false private void ButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      if isWindowOpen          w  new Window      isWindowOpen  true        turn off the following two lines to see a noteable difference.      w.AllowsTransparency  true       w.WindowStyle  WindowStyle.None       Even when the transparency is set to false, the memory increased by the new       Window will never be returned. Try making the window a little bit heavier by      adding a few buttons and combos and clicking them rapidly before closing the       window.       w.Show        else     w.Close isWindowOpen  false GC.Collect      Console.WriteLineGC.GetTotalMemorytrue.ToString     Console.WriteLineGC.CollectionCount0.ToString       codepre  pCan any CLRWPF guru please explain this Is there absolutely no way I can force GC to run immediately after I close the transparent window, freeing up all the memory it consumed  I understand GC might run later when it needs to, but after all task manager is all what clients get, and there are some maniacs also.p

Negative 7346 pOne of my apps maintains a tree of objects, displayed in an outline view.  Ive implemented a long routine for moving or copying objects from one node to another.  This routine is invoked, for example, when the user executes a drag and drop in the outline view.p  pIt gets to be fun when objects are moved within the same parent.  Or when objects are not allowed at certain nodes, although I do allow the user to drop them there, I helpfully adjust their final location.  After several weeks, and a few bug fixes during the first few releases, I got this routine to always behave as expected.  I think.  But Im not sure, because this method was developed emad hocem.  That means When I found something that didnt work, I fixed it.p  pCurrently Im working on improving its performance in a few corner cases.  For example, code which reindexes all affected nodes immediately after each any object is moved is logically bulletproof, but costly when the user moves 1000 items in at the head of a node already containing 1000 items.p  pAs I look at this code, it seems to me that some computer scientist might at some point have written a textbook chapter or something on this topic, and I should buy that book, read it, rip out my emad hocem code and do it the emrightem way.  But I cant find any in a web search.  Does anyone know of any such bookp  pOr maybe not.  Maybe this is one of those cases where, after all is said and done, each application too different to propose a general solutionp  pThanks,p  pJerry Krinockp

Negative 7346 pOkay, I have thought  before asking this question because at first it does sound like the age old question that boils down to is it possible to write inside of an archive. I am new to Mac OS X but I have read that applications are just a folder with the code.appcode extension and a specific file structure. So, I would like to know if it is possible to write inside of this folder, and if so how.p  pThe reason I ask is because in my Java program, on windows, it reads some files that are in the programs directory the principle of Program Files but on OSX applications dont seem to create any files that are apparent  so I guessed that they must store them in the code.appcode folder If I assumed wrong though, Id like to know where applications normally store the files that they create please.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrong The whole reason I ask this question is because I fear negative feedback if my application leaves files behind, so really I need informative opinions. In short, my application needs a configuration file, but it also allows users to create their own databases. I now think that I will store these in the users document folder, but Im not sure as to whether I should delete these files when the app is deleted or just leave them. Obviously, deleting them would require me to make a package  which would just be an extra step for the user, so what do you think... Oh yes, and the applications generates a license file upon the user entering a valid serial key  on Windows the information is stored in the registry, but on Mac I am not sure where to put the file containing this information Any help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 7346 pI am using jquery mobile and I have an annoying issue... When an element has a link, for example a button, I am catching events like touchEnd event to fire then javascript calls or prevent link. However, when a long press button 1 or 2 seconds, ALWAYS executes the link Tested on iOS5 and Android and tried several possibilities but problem remains For example, following code should prevent link and it does if you click fast at button. However, if you press button and hold it touchend is not fired, link is also executed Also if you do not handle any event. Thank you p  precodedocument.readyfunction      a.bindtouchend, functionevent                    event.stopImmediatePropagation           event.preventDefault    codepre  pEDIT problem comes from tabhold event that always fire link although this event is used or not Definetely seems a bug and possible solution could be set its time to infinite.

But nothing seems to work to serialize the object being passed in from Silverlight.p  pCan anybody provide any help with this issue Thanks p
Negative 7346 pI am trying to create a background for my game that gives the impression that some things are further than the others. so lets say i have a sky, a sun, some clouds and the ground. the sky and the sun are the furthest, the clouds in the middle and the ground is in the front. now if the player zooms or pans the camera i want the further layers to move less than the closer layers to give the impression that they are really further the ground moves the most and the clouds move less and the sun almost doesnt move just like the way auto parallax behave except that it is a static background so normally nothing moves unless the players zooms in or out.p  pthis concept is implemented in angry birds with the game play objects the birds, pigs, blocks...and the ground are in the front, a mountain layer in the middle and the sky and clouds are the furthest.p  pnow if you understood what i am trying to accomplish please give me an idea how to go about doing that because it drove me crazy the past few days and i just couldnt even put the concept to implement it yet. any code would also be great.p

Negative 7346 pI have a very specific Android HTC Rezound issue and Im hoping someone may have a solution.p  pWhile using the HTC Rezound AND connected to a 4g network I recieve an unknown host exception error when attempting to connect to our servers using HttpURLConnection.  The strange thing about this issue is that if the phone is on WiFi or 3g the connections to the server work perfectly.  Only 4g has the issue.  I beleive the issue stems from the servers TTL Time to Live, which is set to 0 seconds.  Unfortunetly, changing the TTL is not an option and a work around is needed.  p  pAs a test I hard coded the IP address of the host name and attempted to connect using that and it worked fine.  Now, hard coding the IP address is not a real solution as the servers are using a DNS level round robin load balancer.  I tried to programmatically retreive the IP address using InitAddressp  precodeInetAddress inet  InetAddress.getByNameurl.getHost String ipAddress  inet.getHostAddress codepre  pUnfurtunately, this workaround also returns an Unknown host exception as well.p  pI also attempted to change the Javas internal DNS Cache by usingp  precode     System.setPropertynetworkaddress.cache.ttl , 100  codepre  pBut this too did not work.p  pAny other suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciatedp  pThank you.p
Negative 7346 pstrongI dislike nulls in the dbstrongp  pI have seen too many bugs arises over the years from the sometimes surprising nature of nulls. Especially for columns we dont expect to contain nulls we can easily fail to think through their implications and get bad results. I am strong believer that emptiness for string fields if allowed should typically be represented in the db as an empty strings vs a null. The worst though is allowing a mix of both where they both mean the same thing.p  pSo because of my experience with past problems, Ive methodically considered each field and added the constraint null  false to any field in the db that I didnt have a good reason to allow nulls. For cases where I want to allow empty strings, I set that as the default.p  pSo far so good.p  pstrongI like how ruby treats default valuesstrongp  pAs Ive done this Ive noticed that ActiveRecord takes my default defined in the DB and initializes the properties on the object with that value. I love thatp  pBut this has left me wanting more. Because now I find that I am adding code likep  precodevalidates name, presence gt true codepre  pevery case where Ive defined a notnull constraint in the db except those cases where Ive chosen to provide a default empty string. But why am I repeating myself So Im thinkingwouldnt it be nice if ActiveRecord did this for mep  pstrongHow can I add validating presence from db propertiesstrongp  pIs there a way I can automatically create these validations for every case where there is a not null constraint in the dbexcept in the special case where I allow empty strings and signal that by setting that as the defaultp  pBonus If there is a way to get rails to add a check for different than empty string into the db column and then only automatically add the validation of presence for string fields if they have both the not null constraint and then not empty string check, that would be truly great. Just dont know if that is possible. p

From my research, I would like to create images in the following pixel sizes to cater to all icon sizes 16, 32, 48, 96, 256.p  pI have also found a program to convert the 5 pictures to a single ico file called png2ico.p  pMy problem is this. My source pictures are 32 bit RGB  alpha PNG files. Ive heard only Vista and later supports reading of .ico files with PNG content in them, so is it dangerous then to use ico files with PNGs inside if I release to the general public who might only have Windows XPp  pIf I need to use ico files with BMP inside instead, is it dangerous to use 32 bit BMPs Id rather not use 24 bit BMPs due to bad antialiasing etc.p  pIf I need to use BMP over PNG, is there any recommendation for a program which converts from multiple BMPs to a single .ico filep

Negative 7346 pSo Ive been messing around with some JavaScript inheritance techniques and heres one case in which Im trying to derive a strong solution.p  pHeres a simple example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netJgrYu relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netJgrYuap  pstrongThe Issuestrong Logically wed expect the two divs to be both 0s.  But since were just newing the extended class we dont regenerate our c variable.p  pA potential fix for this is to use Functional inheritance a hrefhttpjsfiddle.neth8xtz relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.neth8xtzap  precodefunction mybase      var that       var c  0      that.hi  function          var ele  ltdivgtltdivgt         ele.htmlc         body.appendele           return that   function myextended      var that  mybase      that.hi      return that   myextended.prototype  new mybase  document.readyfunction      var a  myextended     var b  myextended  codepre  pstrongHoweverstrong the issue with this is that we clutter the global namespace and each object duplicates the functional properties when in reality we just want duplication of the private variables. p  pstrongSo,strong what Im looking for is a better approach than functional inheritance to solve this issue.  Ive thought about making a psuedo classical inheritance structure where I separate the private and public variablesfunctions but I havent been able to come up with a version with less overhead than the functional inheritance.p

Negative 7346 pI have a treetraversal API that looks like thisp  precodetreeTraverseTree ptr, void  callbackTree ptr codepre  pThis API traverses the tree and calls the call back function with each entry. I want to traverse the tree and call a function p  precodemyFuncTree ptr, int a, int b codepre  pfor every entry on the tree, but as you can see above the call back function only accepts one argument, so registering myFunc as the call back function wont work. How do I get around this problem.p  pRewriting the treeTraverse API to accept variable arguments would not feasible, as it is a framework API and if I need to change it I would have to get it reviewed by lot of people. Not something I am looking forward to as I only need to implement a very small functionality.p  pAnother way way would be to make the variables a amp b global, so myFunc can access it. but this solution looks very ugly.p  pIs there any other way around thisp

Negative 7346 pIve always been under the impression that I shouldnt define a variable inside of a loop because its unnecessary or wasteful. This makes me wonder if the following recv function needs a fresh buffer for each iteration of the loopp  precodewhile totalBytesRecvd lt echoStrLen      char buffer[BUFSIZE]     numBytes  recvsock, buffer, BUFSIZE  1, 0     ...     totalBytesRecvd  numBytes     buffer[numBytes]  0     fputsbuffer, stdout  codepre  pThe documentation for recv doesnt mention anything about how it uses the buffer pointer. For a better understanding, I tried defining the buffer just before the loop, and recv appears to overwrite the buffer, instead of redefining it. Which makes sense since recv is passed a pointer to the beginning of the buffer.p  pIs there a specific reason to define a buffer over and over again inside of a loop Or is my basic understanding of this correctp

Negative 7346 pI encountered the following problem  when integrating Facebook in my application, I have implemented the key to login  logout. She had to call up the authorization and replace text in a button after authentication is successful. If the user is already logged in  she had to call a method to logout and also change the text in the button after the logout. Along the way, I ran to the fact that when you call the authorization I endlessly spinning progress and in the end nothing happened, but that I got rid of  this Facebook prank. So the problem is that they are login and logout are correct, but  there is no change in the text, and the log is also not working.

Negative 7346 pIm using the File.SetCreationTime method to update the creation time of files. It works on files in local folders, but for some reason it doesnt work on a shared network folder. I can create, delete, rename files using the same application, but this method just refuses to work. Ive read the method description on MSDN, and it says that an UnauthorizedAccessException is raised, when the caller doesnt have the proper permissions. However, I dont get any kind of exception.

Negative 7346 pIf you set your target SDK version in the Android manifest file to 3, then your layout on largescreen devices will be just a scaled up version of what it is on smallscreen devices. Once you set the target SDK to a higher SDK, you can create separate layouts for each screen density, which provides a much better user experience.p  pstrongHoweverstrong, my layout is mainly made up of images, that are high enough resolution that they display just fine on all screen sizes, even when scaled up, because theyre big enough that they dont need to be stretched. Now, it would be much easier for me to just create a smallscreen layout and have it scaled up, because it would still look nice on large screens. Is there any way I can get that effect without going back to API level 3p
Negative 7346 pIm designing a formbuilding interface.  All available fields will be in an unordered list on the left of the interface, with a large, empty unordered list on the right which will become my webform.  The trick to making this interface work is having the list items from the left transformed into valid html elements by appending html into the droppable ui element just before they are appended into the sortable list on the right.p  pI have it working...mostly...using draggable and sortable.  Currently, I use the receive event of sortable to get the id from the draggable element, which I place into a data block to pass to the update event.  From there, I do an ajax call with the id element, determine what type of field it is and what options should be added from the back end, build the element, then put it in the interface using codeui.item.htmlcode, which is an element passed by the update function.p  pThe problem with my method is that it also is firing when an element is dragged, which cause select elements to litter the screen when they unintentionally append to the sortable list.  Clearly, the receive event is the one that is fired only when the sort gets an item from a connected list.  However, if I try to inner html the codeui.itemcode element, it changes the source list, not the desired target.  When items are already in the webform list on the right, I definitely dont want to be modifying them if theyre just being sorted.p  pIs there any way to access and change the target html in a connected codesortablecode list receive event  Are there any other strategies that might solve my challengep  pThe Codep  precodeltdiv classgrid3 mainwindow formfieldsgt      lth3gtAvailable Fieldslth3gt     ltdiv idaccordiongt          ltulgt             ltligtFirst Nameltligt             ltligtLast Nameltligt               ltligtCompanyltligt                      ltulgt     ltdivgt      ltdivgt     ltdivgt       ltdiv classgrid12 formcontainer formfieldsgt     lth3gtWebformlth3gt     ltform idform actionhttpresponses.smarttracks.com methodpostgt          ltinput typehidden namewebformid idwebformid valueltphp echo webformid gtgtltinputgt           ltul idwebformlistgtltulgt     ltformgt     ltdivgt codepre  pAnd the jQueryp  precode  Make webform fields draggable         .masterlist li .draggable         connectToSortable webformlist,         helper clone,         revert invalid         Make form elements sortable       webformlist .sortable         revert true,         cursor pointer,         placeholder placeholderdiv,         receive functionevent, ui              this.dataid, ui.item[0].id             var element  event.target           ,          update functionevent, ui              var fieldname  ui.item.text             if this.dataid                   .ajax                     url webformgetFieldAttributes,                                      timeout 30000,                     type POST,                     data idthis.dataid,                     dataType json,                     error functionXMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown                            alertAn error has occurred making the request   errorThrown                     ,                     success functiondata                         switch data.controltype                              case text                                 var inputfield  ltinput typetextgt.attrid, fieldname                                  var field  ui.item.text                                  switch field                                      case Email Address                                         inputfield.addClassvalidate[optional,custom[email]]                                         break                                     default                                         inputfield.addClassvalidate[required]                                         break                                                                   break                             case textarea                                  var inputfield  lttextareagt                                 break                             case Dropdown Menu Single Select                                 var inputfield  ltselectgt                                  .eachdata.fieldoptions, functionname, value                                      inputfield.appendltoptiongtltoptiongt.attrvalue,name.textvalue                                                                    inputfield.addClassvalidate[required]                                 break                             case Radio Buttons Single Select                                  var inputfield  ltdiv classwebformradiogroupgt                                  .eachdata.fieldoptions, functionname, value                                      var container  ltdiv classwebformradiooptiongt                                     var radio  ltinput typeradiogt.attr    name name,value value,id name                                      radio.appendTocontainer                                     ltlabel fornamegtnameltlabelgt.appendTocontainer                                     ltdiv classcleargt.appendTocontainer                                      container.appendToinputfield                                                                  break                                                   if data.controltype  Radio Buttons Single Select                              ui.item.htmlltdiv classwebformradiogrouplabelgtfieldnameltdivgt.appendinputfield.appendltdiv classcleargt.wrapInnerltdiv classwebformquestiongroupgt.wrapInnerltdiv classhoverdiv gt                          else                              ui.item.html.appendltlabel forfieldnamegtfieldnameltlabelgt.appendinputfield.wrapInnerltdiv classhoverdiv gt                                                                                               codepre
Negative 7346 pI want to use Graphics.DrawString to draw characters using individual colors.p  pThe problem is that each time I call DrawString, I have to know where to position it either using a Point or a Rectangle relative to the other characters.p  pThis is almost possible when taking into account the kerning and wrapping that happens when you use DrawString in a rectangle with a StringFormat.  The StringFormat is important to specify alignment, wrapping, trimming, etc.p  pIdeally Id be able to tell DrawString how to color each character individually.  The other option is if I can measure a string in a rectangle using a StringFormat and then retrieve the X and Y positions of each character index, so that I can draw each one with its own brush.p  pI tried to measure each character individually, but that will not work because a combination of characters in a string is not the same width as each character measured on its own.p  pstrongEDITstrong Here is what is happening when I take a string, get the Region array, fill those regions with red and blue alternating, and then try to draw each individual character in those regionsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOaE2f.png altenter image description herep  pI am calling DrawString as followsp  precodeg.DrawStringcharacter, font, brush, region.GetBoundsg codepre  pAlso tried the followingp  precodeRectangle bounds  Region.GetBoundsg g.DrawStringcharacter, font, brush, new PointFbounds.Left, bounds.Top codepre  pAnd,p  precodeg.DrawStringcharacter, font, brush, region.GetBoundsg, stringFormat codepre  pSame results.p

The array I give you is contained in the variable Named assignedHours. Sorry about leaving that out.p  pEDIT 2 To clarify, my question is in the bit between the two code excerpts. Im trying to see if one of the objects in the given array matches the day and hour in the loop, and nested loop Im running through. If it does I want to pass that on to a new object which I then push into the hours array of the day. If not then I still pass the object but with a 0 value for it being available.p
Negative 7346 pIm using CakePHPs translatable behavior. I have a few existing fields working fine, but Im having trouble adding a new translatable field to my model.p  pCakePHP uses an INNER JOIN to fetch all translatable fields from the database.p  pNow, if I add an extra translatable field to my model, all the translation records for that field wont exist in the database. And because of the inner join, whenever it tries to fetch ANY existing records from the database, it will return blank  because the INNER JOIN on the new field fails, and so the entire query returns nothing.p  pSurely people must have come accross this situation before. Is there an easy solutionp  pOne solution would be to editoverride the core and make all the INNER JOINs into LEFT OUTER  JOINs. Is there anything wrong with thatp  pAnother solution would be to run an update on the translations table to create all the extra records for the new field, every time you add a new translatable field  but I hate that solution.p  pIs there a better solution How have others dealt with this problemp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 7346 pIf a single thread process is currently running and a signal is detected by kernel, does the kernel simply halt the current execution, save the current address space of the instruction pointer and run the signal handler. In other words, it uses the same thread, that was being used by the program to execute the signal handler What happens if a process is multithreaded If a program have 3 threads and one thread registers the signal handler for say SIGUSR1, will the kernel interrupt the thread that had registered the signal handler and remainder two threads will continue to runp

Negative 7346 pThe question is, given a BST, find out whether there are two numbers that add up to a given number codekcode. No extra memory should be used.p  pNow if it were a sorted array, I could have simply kept two pointers, one at the beginning, one at the end. At each step I would compute the sum of the two numbers pointed by the pointers, if the sum were less than k, I would have incremented the starting pointer, else decremented the end pointer until there is a match, or the pointers overlap.p  pI can do the same thing with the BST, converting it into a sorted array through inorder traversal, but that requires extra memory. So I think an iterator solution would be in order. I would keep two iterators, one would traverse the BST in the normal inorder manner, calling which will return the next bigger number, and the other would traverse the BST in reverseinorder way, returning the next smaller number upon each call.p  pAny idea how to design such iterators I would prefer a solution in PythonJavascript. Although Python provides functions like codeitercode, I want to design it using closures.p

Negative 7346 pHi im starting to work with webGL using Three.js and I need to detect if a click on a sphere is within a certain section of its surface.p  pCurrently i can detect if the sphere was clicked and get the coords of the point clicked. Now what i need is to detect if that click was in a certain region of that sphere, based on a array of 3D points from that sphere another suggestion is ok.p  pThe sphere is in the center point, and the point is garrantied to be on the surface of the sphere. Now i need to calculate if its just within a section section. Any suggestions My problem seams to be more mathematical.  Also i prefere a generic way to do this because the sections may be just a triangle or may be more complex figures.p

Im sorry if there is an easier way to ask this, but I cant wrap my head around it.p  pI have read through very many suggestions though none of them fit what I am looking for. I understand it is very easy to just float the information left and allow it to stack by itself.  My problem is that I am showing information in a card form with two different sized cards and I would like them all to stack without gaps vertically.p  pFor the purpose of showing this, Ive given every card a number from 13.

The larger cards push down the row leaving a large gap where a smaller card is.p  pI also understand that after the first visibile row, the most recent divs could potentially be pushed farther down in one column rather than another.  for example, if column 1 has 6 featured or large cards, it would take 12 cards to fill the space beside it.

Negative 7346 pI just discovered a rather strange problem with EclipseLink both 2.3.0 and 2.4.1 and just wanted to ask if anyone can confirm that this is a bug and not just that I am missing something obvious ...p  pBasically, I have two entities involved, let us simply call them A and B. A had an eager if that matters, noncascading manytoone unidirectional reference to B modelled in the database with a join column. The DB table A contains the columns ID PK, BID FK to B.ID, and more, the table B contains the columns ID and a few more.p  pNow, I had a list of As, which should be updated with references to new B instances. In pseudocode something likep  precodeforA a  list       using some criteria, check if perhaps a matching B      entity is already found in the database     B b  perhapsGetExistingBFromDatabase      ifb  null           no existing B was found, create a new         b  new B          set values in B         b.setFoo4711,         b.setBar42           save B         em.mergeb            set reference from A to B ...     a.setBb      ... and update A     em.mergea  codepre  pSince the reference was noncascading, it was necessary to merge both b and a. Everything worked as expected.p  pThen, someone I changed the cascade type of the relationship from none to mergepersist, since that was required somewhere else in the code. I expected the old code to work, merging b is not really required, shouldnt IMHO however hurt A brief test confirmed that it still worked, the new B entity was inserted and A updated accordingly.p  pBUT, it only works if there is only one A entity in the list. Running through the loop a second time causes EclipseLink to autoflush the session since codeperhapsGetExistingBFromDatabasecode does a SELECT .. FROM B, there is a merged B entity cached and it wants the database table to be up to date. Using FINEST logging level and breakpoints in the code, I can verify that EclipseLink determines that it is required to generate an id for the new B entity, it invokes the sequence generator and also sets the id in the correct field of the entity. Still, EclipseLink invokes SQL statements similar to thesep  precodeINSERT INTO B ID, ... VALUES0, ... UPDATE A SET BID  0 WHERE ID  ... codepre  pThe generated id is lost somewhere and EclipseLink tries to create a new entity with id0. The data is indeed invalid and later, EclipseLink also throws a PersistenceException Null or zero primary key encountered in unit of work clone.p  pBug or my mistakep  hr  pEdit James asked for the mapping of B.IDp  precodeId GeneratedValuegenerator  sqidgen, strategy  GenerationType.SEQUENCE SequenceGeneratorname  sqidgen, sequenceName  ..., allocationSize  100 Columnname  id protected long id codepre  pNote, that removing the unneccesary codeem.mergebcode solves my problem. It is just not obvious to me why the invocation of merge causes EclipseLink to fail completely, trying to insert a B instance without a populated id.p

Negative 7346 pI wonder if anyone could help me with this problem in the application of the matplotlib widgetsp  pI have to work with the spectra of HII galaxies these are simply a flat plots with some sudden peaks whose location is known to us. I need to confirm the location of these lines you could say the thickness of the peaks on the plot and determine the continuum level this means the average y coordinate of the plot at the left and right regions of the peak. This is a simple task but given the number of plots and the number of lines in each plot I would like to use a short python code to simplify the process and avoid me missing some of the peaks.p  pI have watched the lectures of John Hunter on youtube and I believe I will be more than happy with the default widgets to use as my GUI, particularly the spanselector, press event and cursor event. p  pMy problem is that I am not sure which is the right way to work with several widgets affecting the same graph Currently my code opens a given spectrum and starts to display a fraction of the plot where I know my first line should be.

The Grid extends JPanel and the Cell also extends JPanel. Earlier on I made the link above to ask how to implement a MouseListener to do this. As the code is all on that page, I am just going to refer to it.p  pSomeone posted an excellent answer on that link which I accepted. I can now use MouseListener to detect movement, clicks etc in any cell on the grid.p  pHowever, Ive hit another road block. I am trying to place ships on my grid. I am forgetting about orientation for now as Im assuming all ships will be placed horizontally. The first ship will take up five cells. I would like to move my cursor onto a cell on the grid and have four other tail cells, to the right of the cell the cursor is over, highlighted as well. If there arent five free cells in total perhaps because the cursor is too near the edge of the grid, the cells will turn red. Otherwise, they will turn green.  p  pAfter the first ship is placed, the second will need placing. It is four cells long. Therefore, when hovering over a cell it will have a tail of three cells and so on.p  pI am happy with how to change colours, how to handle orientation and how to change from five ships to four ships and so on. However, I have no idea how to select multiple cells at once. Does anybody know how to implement this I would love to post what I have tried but the truth is, Ive got nothing.p

Negative 7346 pI have a number of urls that are stored in a database, and thus instead of adding a rewrite rule in .htaccess for every url, I am using the following code in htaccess to give the control to PHP code through the following ReWrite rule in Apachep  precodeRewriteRule . .index.php codepre  pA url mentioned in the database, has a corresponding original url. Though, the tricky situation comes when I have to serve the content of the url fetched from DB by the corresponding original url for which the ReWrite rules are written in .htaccess. One solution is to implement the same rewrite rules for the url fetched from DB in PHP as written in Apache  for the original url, however, the number of such original urls is huge.p  pThus would be glad to know about a solution if possible which can make execution flow through the ReWrite rules mentioned in Apache after the processing inside PHP is complete.p

Negative 7346 pstrongThe appstrong A JavaScript function listens for changes on form elements input amp select, and posts the data to a CFC method that assigns them to a Session struct. The struct is returned, making the form data usable for the life of the session. The app is adapted from code at a hrefhttpwww.raymondcamden.comindex.cfm2012110UsingaserverorsessionstoragetopersistformvaluesRaymond Camdens Using a server, or session storage, to persist form valuesa.p  pstrongIssuestrong The original CFC code is written in CFScript. Because were on ColdFusion 8, I get an error when the method is called. So, I translated the method into ColdFusion tag syntax and stopped getting that error. In Chromes Dev Tools, I can see data passing to the CFC via the JSON object each time I enter something into a form element. So I know the JavaScript function is working. And even though Im not getting any return errors, there are some behaviors that lead me to believe that my translation is incorrect. E.g., the dump of the session struct only displays the last input element entered, rather than all of them as is the case in Rays demo.p  pHeres the original CFScript version and then my tag translation. In addition to any comments about where my translation is wrong, Id love to have an explanation of this line, codeltcfset s.name  [s[name]] gtcode, particularly the code[s[name]]code construct, since Im not able to articulate whats happening there.

So I wish to find platform native way to do this. Because simple Google search gave me a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationdarwinreferencemanpagesman1heap.1.html relnofollowthiscodeheapcode commanda, Im sure that theres an API function too.p  pI am looking for this only for debug build assertion to detect the case of deleting stackallocated object. So its enough to know where the address is pointing  stack or heap. So performance, version compatibility, internal API or any quality concerns doesnt matter. maybe testing on simulator also can be an option But I think this is not that heavy operation if stack is completely separated from heap.p  pI tagged C, but API in any other language is also fine if it is applicable from C.p

Negative 7346 pIm working within Facebook with the Koala gem and finally have to deal with a user having changed their password.  While it may not be the best interaction, my app catches the authentication change and presents the user with a link to click to reauthorize.  Clicking the link correctly hits FB and the redirect delivers the expected authcode.  HOWEVER, the page delivered in response to the FB redirect is returned with XFrameOptions set to DENY with the result that the user never sees the reauthentication results.p  pIm lost as to why the XFrameOptions are set to DENY.p  pI have tried setting the XFrameOptions to SAMEORIGIN from within the Rails 3.2.6 application by adding the following line to the actionp  precoderesponse.headers[XFrameOptions]  SAMEORIGIN codepre  pNo luck.p  pI have also tried adjusting the response headers via Apache.  I have tried setting the XFrameHeader for the entire site as well as targeting the specific urls that could be affected.

I have tried separate Location and LocationMatch blocks that target the individual URLs in addition to the current configuration.  I have also tried using Header unset rather than set to remove the XFrameOptions however its being set.p  pSo far as I can tell these are the ONLY urls in the application that are returning the XFrameOptions header set to DENY.p  pIdeasp

Negative 7346 pI am trying to display scatterplots using Python and Matplotlib that plot data points belonging to one of several categories. I have decided to represent the categories by color with a legend, which makes for difficult tradeoffs between using symbols who are big enough that their colors are easily visible and symbols small enough to not excessively cover each other. There are several thousand points at leastp  pHowever, Im also running into another problem. I separate the categories into a set of numpy arrays, which I then plot one by one. This has the effect of making it look like there are many more points from the last category because it was plotted last so its points are on top. If I plotted all the categories at once relatively shuffled together, I wouldnt have this issue but I couldnt colorcode the points. Increasing the window size helps, but doesnt totally solve it. Does anyone know of a good way to mitigate this Is there some way to shuffle the data sets together or assign different colors to points in a single plot I may just have to change my approach to visualizing this data.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6XBXm.png altenter image description herep

Negative 7346 pI need to generate global unique ids by hashing some data.p  pOn the one hand, I could use a combination of timestamp and network address, which is unique since every computer can only create one id at the same time. But since this data is to long Id need to hash it and thus collisions could occur. As a side note, we could also throw in a random number if the timestamp is not exact enough.p  pOn the other hand, I could just use a random number and hash that. Shouldnt that bring exactly the same hash collision probability as the first approach It is interesting because this approach would be faster and is much easier to implement.p  pIs there a difference in terms of hash collisions when using unique data rather than random data By the way, I will not use real GUIDs as described by the standard but mine will only be 64 bits long. But that shouldnt affect the question.p

Negative 7346 pIm using TastyPie and Django to build out my backend for an application that will have browser and mobile native iOS clients.p  pI have been through the TastyPie and Django docs, can authenticate successfully either using the TastyPie resources I set up, or using Djangos built in views. I see a lot of examples on including the CSRF token on the page and grabbing it with your JavaScript, and that works, but I dont understand now to actually determine whether a user is logged in on initial page load from JavaScript. p  pExamplep  pIf I want to serve static HTML from a separate, fast web server, and cache my application JavaScript, and only interact with Django through TastyPie views, how do I determine if the user is logged in and know to render a login form or the app views using JavaScript, and after logout, is there any session information I need to remove from the client browserp  pIf I were to serve up HTML through Djangos template engine, I could render the login form through there appropriately, but that seems not ideal if I want to truly decouple my JavaScript app from Django and behave like a mobile client.p  pEdit I am using Backbone.js, but I dont think that should matter.p  pUPDATEp  pI think I figured it out reading through Djangos CSRF documentation again.p  pIf your view is not rendering a template containing the csrftoken template tag, Django might not set the CSRF token cookie. This is common in cases where forms are dynamically added to the page. To address this case, Django provides a view decorator which forces setting of the cookie ensurecsrfcookie.p  pIf I do not want to render Django templates, this reads like I can still use the cookie and pull that into my Backbone or jQuery AJAX methods. Im not sure if TastyPie ensures the cookie will be sent or how to tie into it.p  pIf I use AJAX to logout, will the cookie automatically be removed or does it become invalid Are these CSRF tokens unique to each user session Ill have to test some things tomorrow with it. Is it possible to use Django decorators on TastyPie viewsp

Negative 7346 pstrongEditstrong 20131107 I see a lot of views on this question.  If this question and answer do not help you, please let me know in some way so I can fix it.p  hr  pI have a codeFileUploadcode control in my .aspx file.  I have a couple validators tied to it a codeCustomValidatorcode for file size and a codeRegularExpressionValidatorcode for file extension type.  I would like to add a clientside codeonchangecode event to my codeFileUploadcode to fire after the validators fire, but when I do this...p  precodeltaspFileUpload runatserver IDupl1 onchangedisableEnableUploadButton gt codepre  p...the onchange handler seems to get overwritten by the validators.  The same thing happens when I add it as an attribute in the CodeBehinds codePageLoadcode method.p  pIs there an easy way to fix this, hopefully without adding an onclientload event to dig through the page and modify attributes of the resulting file inputp  pMy current solution is to add another codeCustomValidatorcode or modify the one that already exists, and put the code I want in its codeClientValidationFunctioncode script block.  However, this does not fire when a user cancels the file inputs file dialogue box.  And its really crude.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong Heres a working as far as I can tell solution, trimmed a bit.

Negative 7346 pMy question is mostly architectural in nature. I am using a codeUITableViewControllercode to display a list of stuff. No big deal, pretty standard. However, the codetableHeaderViewcode contains a significant amount of functionality. There are a few tap targets, it animates, and the display changes based on user interaction. Currently I have a custom subclassed codeUIViewcode handling most of the display logic and routing taps back through a delegate protocol to the codeUITableViewControllercode for execution.p  pAs more functionality gets added to the codetableHeaderViewcode, I feel as though my codeUITableViewControllercode is becoming a bit cluttered and long. Thus I am curious if it makes sense to create a subclassed codeUIViewContollercode and set its codeviewcode to the codetableHeaderViewcode of my codeUITableViewControllercode If this is done, I would separate concerns a bit more and could house almost all of the logic in my new UIViewController I am guessing I would still need to route some communication via a delegate between the two viewControllers.p  pDoes this make sense from an architectural perspective Or should I just continue using the existing codeUITableViewControllercode for all logic p  p EDIT p  pFor example, does this code make sense when placed in my codeUITableViewControllercodep  precode voidaddHeader      myCustomHeaderViewController hvc  [[myCustomHeaderViewController alloc] init]     Assume the view for hvc is set up wre to sizing, etc.     self.tableView.tableHeaderView  hvc.view  codepre

Negative 7346 pI have an HTML form where I am trying to get a text field to display certain text when I select one of the radio buttons. So far, I have it to where if I click the button it will display the proper text in the text field. My goal is to eliminate the Click button and have the text field display the text immediately when I select a radio button. How can I do this in Javascript p  pI know that textfields have an OnKeyUp event, but I cant seem to figure out if a radio button has some sort of similar thing that would allow me to determine when one is selected. Ive tried OnChange and OnFocus events, but maybe Im doing it wrong because I cant get those to work.

Negative 7346 pWe are trying to switch from MyEclipse 10 to Eclipse Indigo.  We are currently using WebLogic 9.2, and typically debug directly in Eclipse.p  pUsing MyEclipse, we were able to get the Server defined within the IDE to startstop the Managed Server directly, having already started the Node Manager and Admin server manually prior.  However, with Eclipse and WTP, we have not been able to determine how to do the same.p  pWhen defining a server in Eclipse Indigo, it allows us to specify the domain, but when we start it we only get the Admin server started.  For writing and debugging applications this is useless.  What I am looking for is a means to allow me to startstop the Managed Server and not the Admin server.  I have Googled repeatedly to no avail as everything I have found walks me through the same process I have already performed.  Remote debugging doesnt seem like a good option.p  pYes I know we are on an ancient version of WL.  Yes I know we really should update for numerous reasons.  Those decisions are well above my pay grade, and we have already raised our concerns with the people who have that authority.  I just need to get what I have working like I want.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I have been searching and playing and searching some more.  Tried to simply change the Start script in the Debug Configuration to be that of the Managed Server instead of the LocalAdmin.  However, if I have the LocalAdmin started via Service or Command line, Eclipse sees this and makes the server in the Server tab as Running.  Trying to start it causes the running LocalAdmin to stop and the Managed Server to start...not what I need.p  pMy next thought was to do what I did in MyEclipse, which was to duplicate the Debug Config and add the appropriate VM args to start the Managed Server, but there is no place to do that as there are no config options to control the VM args.p  pFinally, I tried to add a Generic Server, point it to the WebLogic JARs, but I never get an option to Debug the Generic Server.p  pI am not sure what else to try.  SOMEONE has to be other there that has debugged a Managed Server within Eclipse  My only other thought is to turn on remote debugging.  This seems like a painful option.p  pIt just seems odd that there is no option to attach to a Managed Server.  Id have to think SOMEONE out there has done this, or needed this.  Otherwise, whats the point of offering itp

As a last resort, I could have the application run a local web server and update the contents of a page based on whether anything on the scraped web page has been updated, then use something else entirely e.g. an AutoHotkey script which checks the page on the local web server to see if anything has changed, and use that to display the tooltips. Obviously, it would be much easier if the application itself could notify me in some way.p

My question, though, is why when I emdontem use pkgutil, this still works fine, but only on some platformsparticularly, in OSX and Ubuntu 10 and 12 that Ive seen, it works, but in Windows 7 it doesnt. What I worry is that there is some sideeffect of using pkgutil that Im not considering.p  pThe specific nonworking behavior is that PYTHONPATH appears to be constructed correctly after that script is run in the code.bashrccode equivalent in PowerShell, i.e. I can debug print PYTHONPATH from within Python and it is identical to the path constructed on another platform. However, codefrom projectname1 import foocode succeeds, and codefrom projectname2 import barcode fails presumably because projectname2 is globbed later by alpha. Thats actually the behavior I would expect without pkgutil.

Negative 7346 pI am developing simple drawing app using UIKit using the idea shared in a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com18840comments relnofollowRay Wenderlichsa tutorial. Difference is that I need to implement a feature so that I can zoomscale into my drawing and draw finer lines. I am able to zoom in using CGAffineTransformScale with ofcourse UIPinchGestureRecognizer and move around the UIImage using CGAffineTransform  the problem is that once zoomed in the UITouch points detected and the  actual touch points have a huge offset. This offset gets bigger as I keep scaling the image.p  pIn the code p  pdrawingImage  one which user interacts with brsavingImage  drawn lines are savedbrtransformtranslate

The connection fails after about 650750 iterations of the while loop of the server.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated...p  pThanks p

Negative 7346 pWe are trying to implement the Basic Dual Branch Plan as described by the ALM Rangers in the latest a hrefhttpvsarbranchingguide.codeplex.com relnofollowVisual Studio TFS Branching and Merging Guidea.  From the guidancep  blockquote   pThe basic branch plan with a MAIN, DEV, and RELEASE branch enables concurrent development for your next release, a stable MAIN branch for testing and a RELEASE branch for any ship blocking bug fixes. Multiple development areas are supported by creating additional development branches from MAIN. These are peers to each other and children of MAIN.p      pAdditional releases are supported by creating release branches for each product release. Each release branch is a child of MAIN and a peer to each other e.g. release 2.0 branch is peer to release 3.0 and both are children of MAIN. If supporting only a single release in production at a time, you may consider a single release branch, and make bug fixes directly on this branch. Once the RELEASE branch is created MAIN and the development branches can start taking changes approved for the next product release. p blockquote  pWe are undecided as to whether we want to use a single Release branch and label releases, or create a new release branch per release.  However, there are some questions that apply either way, that dont seem to be addressed by the guidance.  p  pMy main question is At what point in time should we create a RELEASE branch or move tested code to the single RELEASE branch if thats the way we go  p  ol liMy first reaction was to create it only when ready to do the release, but then you have the problem of creating a deadlock for development and testing of the next sprints work you cannot check these changes into MAIN until the RELEASE branch has been created if you do, its more difficult to separate out the changes you only want to go to RELEASE.  li liSecond idea is to create the RELEASE branch at the beginning of the sprint, and as changes pass testing in MAIN, merge them down to the current RELEASE branch.  Once we reach the end of the sprint, we can lock that RELEASE branch down, and create a new one for the next sprint.  This sounds like it would work, but I see no discussion of it anywhere, so I just wanted to see what people are doing.  li ol

I would like to control the order and topics to include on a presentation on a makefile.p  pThe solution Im trying to implement consists in having a top latex file say top.tex that in the end would have a command say slidesorder whose content would be a series of inputs with the names of the files with the slides of the topics to include.p  pIn summary, I havep  ul litop.tex main latex file that near the end has the command slidesorder li litopicA.tex, topicB.tex and topicX.tex latex files with the slides on each topicli ul  pThen Ive written the following makefile that is not working correctlyp  precodeROOT  top  SLIDES  topicB topicA topicC TOINCL  foreach V,SLIDES,inputV  all ROOT.pdf  ROOT.pdf  ROOT.tex SLIDES.tex      echo newcommandslidesorderTOINCL inputROOT  pdflatex codepre  pThe idea would be that by changing the content of the SLIDES variable I would get different presentations from the same sources of slides. My knowledge of Latex and Make is very limited so any help is much appreciated.p

Negative 7346 pIm a Codeigniter developer and for one of my project I need to use Rails instead of CI. I have a database with more than 30 tables which might be added more tables in the future. My task is to get all those tables and show them each individually in a form of bar chart. p  pAll I know about rails is using controller and model with active records to get the datas. I dont want to create individual model for each of the table. Hence, I was wondering is there any better solution such as asking rails to look for available tables inside the database, and based on the requested URI, present the data from table.p

Negative 7346 pIm looking for an efficient way to clear my winform after data has been submitted. Currently I use a static method which accepts a control as a parameter and then loops through the controls, determines the type of control and then clears the contents of the control.  It works quite well but the problem Im having is with the control events. When I clear the control, the control event fires and since there is a data type conversion present in the event int.Parse for example it causes an error because once the control is cleared, the control event is fired and an empty string is passed to int.Parse.  Aside from using a bunch of if statements or int.TryParse in the event from the control to prevent the data conversion from happening, is there a better way to clear a control and not trigger its event in the processp  pThanksp  pHere is an example of my control event and the clear methodp  precode    private void QuantityTextChangedobject sender, EventArgs e              presenter.Quantity  int.ParseQuantity.Text       public static void ClearFormControl.ControlCollection controls              foreach Control ctrl in controls                      if ctrl.GetType  typeofTextBox                              TextBoxctrl.Text                             if ctrl.GetType  typeofComboBox                              ComboBoxctrl.SelectedIndex  0                           if ctrl.GetType  typeofDateTimePicker                              DateTimePicker datePicker  ctrl as DateTimePicker                 datePicker.Format  DateTimePickerFormat.Custom                 datePicker.CustomFormat  ddMMMyyyy                 datePicker.Value  DateTime.Today                           if ctrl.HasChildren                              ClearFormctrl.Controls                            codepre

Negative 7346 pI am writing a few tests for Android code that does business logic and triggers asynchronous db operations through the Sprinkles library. My tests are basically failing when they expect certain data to be present in db, but the data is missing due to the async writes not being completed yet. Therefore, for testing purposes, it seems that I need a way to wait for the async jobs to be finished before I do my assertions.p  pAfter taking a look at how Sprinkles does the asynchronous writes, it simply triggers a new AsyncTask. But these AsyncTasks are completely handled by Sprinkles so I do not have access to them. So I was wondering is there a way to get hold of all ongoing AsyncTasks started by my application If there is, then I can make my tests wait for all AsyncTasks to be completed. Not a great solution, but it would do the trick.p  pOtherwise, does anyone have any tips on how to tackle this problemp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 7346 pSolved as below   I have multiple WPF projects with individual App.Config with custom sections. All custom sections have the same structure.p  pFor one project, I used ConfigurationManager and created Custom ConfigurationSection, ConfigurationCollection, ConfigurationElement and everything works fine for that project.p  pThen I moved my custom configuration classes in a class library so that I can use them in all the projects, but now I am getting System.TypeInitializationException error when I run the project. This seems to be because now ConfigurationManager cant locate the App.p  pI can copy paste the class in all the projects and it works fine but I dont want to do that.

Negative 7346 pI am working on a project involving some stm32 motes and a border router running Contiki but I am planning to switch to ThingSquare very soon. The border router is connected via tunslip6 to a computer, and a server is running on the computer. I want the motes to communicate with the server. The problem is that these motes are supposed not to know the address of the server, and to automatically discover it. One solution would be the motes to send a multicast request, and the server to reply to this request. However, my understanding is that the border router is not able to forward a multicast addressed request. Is it true How can I make this multicast message to propagate just past the border router, staying inside my local LAN Are there any Contiki or Thingsquare projects doing thisp

Negative 7346 pI am implementing the backend of an iOS mobile application with a Ruby on Rails app.  I am currently doing user creation and authentication and have ran into some issues.  I have an API that allows users to create a user account via RESTful routes.  I am trying to now set up some sort of process that allows the user to log in to the newly created account.  I think the login process should go something like this when the user logs in the api creates some sort of mobile session and when they log out the client terminates the session from their end.  First off I was wondering if this is the correct way to implement such a system p  pSecondly I would like to get some ideas on how this system should be set up.  My first thought would be to create new database model named xsession or msession that holds all of the device specific variables such device tokens and user information thats relevant to the session.  The session would be created after the password is verified against the one already stored in the codeusercode database model. The session would be tied to the users ID and upon log out would be removed from the database.  This would create a table in which the rows would represent all active mobile sessions.  Is this the best way to do this  Let me know what everyone thinks, this is my first time implementing something like this and Im excited to see if Im on the right track.p

Negative 7346 pIm trying to add a MessageDialog to a windows phone 8.1 app WinRT with 3 commands. Looking at the documentation for MessageDialogp  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappswindows.ui.popups.messagedialog.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappswindows.ui.popups.messagedialog.aspxa  p  pIt says that The dialog has a command bar that can support up to three commands, so I should think that wouldnt be a problem. I took their example found on the documentation and made a simple test app out of it, and it worked perfectly fine on both desktop and on windows phone. Then, I took the same example and added a single command to itp  precodevar messageDialog  new MessageDialogNo internet connection has been found.   Add commands and set their callbacks both buttons use the same callback function instead of inline event handlers messageDialog.Commands.Addnew UICommand     Try again,     new UICommandInvokedHandlerthis.CommandInvokedHandler messageDialog.Commands.Addnew UICommand     Something else,     new UICommandInvokedHandlerthis.CommandInvokedHandler messageDialog.Commands.Addnew UICommand     Close,     new UICommandInvokedHandlerthis.CommandInvokedHandler   Set the command that will be invoked by default messageDialog.DefaultCommandIndex  0   Set the command to be invoked when escape is pressed messageDialog.CancelCommandIndex  1   Show the message dialog await messageDialog.ShowAsync codepre  pThis works fine on a windows desktop app, but when I take the exact same code and try to use it for a windows phone app, it has no problem adding the 3rd command but when it gets to the await messageDialog.ShowAsync line, it will crash with an unhandled exception. Interestingly, it does not crash in the same manner as a desktop app does when you add 4 commands. For that, it will throw the exception when you try to add the 4th command. On the phone, it wont have a problem with that, but it wont work when it tries to show the messageDialog.p  pAm I missing something, or does the maximum number of commands on a MessageDialog quietly get bumped down from 3 to 2 when youre on a phone p

Negative 7346 pI have a question related to the encoding of Japanese text. p  pLet us say I have a system which comprises a jvm and a database. It serves pages through an application server to client users on Internet Explorer web browser. The JVM and database use UTF8 thoroughly. There are a number of text areas, some but not all of which make use of tinymce. p  pI am concerned about a situation that a Japanese user pastes some text which is not encoded in UTF8. Is this likely to cause problems If the user pastes text encoded in SJIS, can it be expected to work Early tests have not thrown any problems however I have no knowledge of the language and am concerned that special cases may exist.p

I tried to use the profiler gprof but I read somewhere that gprof cannot be used on MIC directly. I tried to use perf by going through tutorial. I could go till a certain step after which when the perf annotate step comes and I execute the code, it gives me the error  unexpected. So I am not knowing how to proceed to profile my code. Can anybody please help  This is the site where I referred to the perf tutorial  sandsoftwaresound.netperfperftutorialhotspots .p

Negative 7346 pI am trying to detect two events in two different GPIOs in the Beaglebone Black, and then decide which one happened first. I am using AdafruitBBIO.GPIO for the code which is written in Python. It is not working properly, and have no idea why. Here is the codep  precodeimport sys import thread import time from datetime import datetime import bitarray import AdafruitBBIO.GPIO as GPIO  gpiostate  [0, 0] gpiotime  [0, 0] irrecv  [GPIO026, GPIO112]  def checkEventindex     while True         if GPIO.eventdetectedirrecv[index]              if gpiostate[index]  0                 gpiostate[index]  1                 gpiotime[index]  datetime.now                 print irrecv[index]                 time.sleep5  time to avoid rebounces  for gpio in irrecv     GPIO.setupgpio, GPIO.IN     GPIO.addeventdetectgpio, GPIO.RISING  try     thread.startnewthreadcheckEvent, 0,       thread.startnewthreadcheckEvent, 1,   except     print Error unable to start thread  while True     if gpiostate[0]  1 and gpiostate[1]  1         if gpiotime[0] gt gpiotime[1]             print 1         if gpiotime[0] lt gpiotime[1]             print 2         if gpiotime[0]  gpiotime[1]             print          gpiostate[0]  0         gpiostate[1]  0         gpiotime[0]  0         gpiotime[1]  0 codepre  pI dont get any error. The main problem is that the events are not compared correctly, e.g. although event in GPIO026 happens first than the one in GPIO112 i.e. gpiotime[0] is smaller than gpiotime[1], the output in the last While loop does not print out 2. Also sometimes the code prints out twice the GPIO pin from the threads.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestion to find a solution.p

Negative 7346 pIm trying to find a way rule or VBA Im agnostic to automatically change the Reminder value when a meeting is rescheduled.p  pIve poked around but been unable to find a way to trigger on a change to the meetings datetime, which seems like the first step to getting to what I want, so guidance on what the rightclosest trigger might be would be enough for me to get started I should be able to muddle through actually checking and reseting the Reminder once I have the trigger.p  pBackground The ultimate goal is to have the scriptrule make sure that when a meeting is rescheduled, its Reminder is not None in the case that a meeting is rescheduled after the reminder has been dismissed being the prime example. In the happiest of worlds, the script would be agnostic to who owns the meeting which is why it seemed best to key off the meeting time changing.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7346 pIm about to start a new Titanium project. So far, what Ive written is whats now considered as Classic Project Ive been writing Titanium apps since before Alloy.p  pI was wondering weather or not its worth while to switch to Alloy for my new project. I know that basically, Alloy compiles to Classic Titanium code before compiling down to the java project or objectivec project. I also know about a big advantage in that precompilation process, which is to mark in alloy code that are relevant only for Android or iPhone and not including the other in the compiled Classic code.p  pMy main concerns are flexibility  as with Classic I feel like I have more control over the code and whats going on.p  pSecond concern, I have controls like open sourced sliding menu that are not written for alloy  how will I be able to have them as part of my projectp  pI started asking myself rather to use Alloy or not after finding introduced in TiConf 2014 TI UX a hrefhttpsgithub.comjaraenTi.UX.Templates relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjaraenTi.UX.Templatesa which is written for Alloy.p  pfew other questionsp  ol lihow can I have old UI code run inside Alloyli liCan I have controls written for Alloy run in a Classic projectli liCan Classic project also map out code not belonging to iOSAndroidli liis there a difference in performance between Alloy projects and Classic projects what about other flexibility issuesli ol  pThanks p

Negative 7346 pI have a Java application that leverages the OBIEE Web Service API to consume data from the BI Server. I am able to XMLViewService and the WebCatalogService just fine, but I cant quite get the HtmlViewService to properly render a report in the Java app. The report just shows the spinning loader, but never actually renders the report. Im pretty sure it has to do with the fact that the Java app and the BI Server are on different domains. This is what the API documentation saysp  pstrongIn situations where Oracle BI Web Services and the thirdparty Web server do not  belong to the same Domain Name Service DNS domain, users may get JavaScript errors related to browser security constraints for crossdomain scripting. To avoid these issues, use the setBridge method to modify callback URLs to point to the thirdparty Web server. Be aware that a Web component executed by the thirdparty Web server to reroute requests to Oracle BI Web Services is not provided. This function would need to be fulfilled by the thirdparty application.strongp  pSeveral years ago, I did this same type of integration using .NETC and ran in the the same issue because the .NET app and the BI Server were on different domains.

Negative 7346 pIm not a fan of membership.p  pPersonally, I find it too intrusive and difficult to seamlessly incorporate into most web applications I work on ... and as such, Ive always implemented Forms based authentication myself.

Negative 7346 pI have Version 1 of my coredata database. Reduced examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comi2KHx.png altenter image description herep  pI make some changes to the model, making V2. This involves creating a new entity with emtypeem attribute plus a few others. The emtypeem attribute is the link to the emplateem entity. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUngPW.png altenter image description herep  pThe new version of my app is released and the data migrates ok as this is lightweight. For my own reasons at the time, I did not create a relationship at this time.p  pSometime later I decide to do some bigger changes to the structure, creating new entities emFixtureTypeem and emPlateTypeImageem. I then create some relationships. This gives me V3 of my model.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDFgka.png altenter image description herep  pBecause of the nature of this modification I need to do heavyweight migration from V2 to V3 which involves copying attribute data, populating new attributes and setting the relationships as I go. So, I set up a mapping model, create my necessary migration policies and hit the go button.  p  pThis works for V2 to V3 but when testing a migration from V1 to V3, I get a series of errors..., such as p  pemreasonCannot migrate store inplace Validation error missing attribute values on mandatory destination relationshipemp  pIm using the following PSC optionsp  precodeNSDictionary options                             NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption  YES,                           NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption  YES                              if [persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithTypeNSSQLiteStoreType configurationnil URLstoreURL optionsoptions erroramperror]  codepre  pSo, my query is how does coredata migrate the data Is it sequentially, so I get a lightweight migration from V1 to V2, then heavyweight V2 to V3, or does it do a migration from V1 to V3 If so, do I need to create a migration policy for V1 to V3 making things unwieldy very quickly to cover every combinationp  pAlso, have I now lost the lightweight migration facility, once I start using heavyweightp  pAdvice and comments appreciated.p

AWS CLI uses Pythonboto as opposed to the old API tools which used Java, which might be an explanation why the functionality is missing couldnt find it in boto either.p  pIf you happen to know how to achieve an instance import in pure Python, Id be very curious about that toop  pAny pointers are greatly appreciated.

But I have to offer the possibility to every sounditem on my model, to add also the individual secrettoken which then will be added to the url in the widget. This Seems a bit too much for me. p  pIsnt there a global secrettoken for my soundcloudaccount I can use instaed in the url Please tell me there is a global token. And tell me where.  p  pthanks, Falkp

Negative 7346 pIndys codeTIdHttpcode class has  in a recent version  a codeDeletecode routine.

Negative 7346 pI have binary files which contain data structures strongof various lengthstrong. I would like to save these blocks of data into separate files. The size of each block is known. The codesplitcode command can, well, split a file but it does not stop after the first block of data.

Negative 7346 pWe have a bunch of web applications which may be started with a script on the command line.

So far so good.p  pNow some of us have upgraded their machines and got VS 2013 instead of VS 2012. Even though they can continue and use Cassini many want to work with IIS Express instead and use the same script, which now must be able to start IIS Express.p  pAnd here lies my problem. IIS Express and Cassini both have the codeportcode and codepathcode command line arguments, but the codevpathcode argument is unsupported by IIS Express why remains a mystery to me.p  pMy question is simple  can IIS Express be started with the virtual path The only solution that comes to my mind isp  ol liStart IIS Express with codeportcode and codepathcode.li liParse the command line to extract the auto generated config file path.li liModify the config file to add the relevant virtual directory.li ol  pAnd of course, this should be done automatically by the script.

Negative 7346 h1Scenarioh1  pIm experimenting with Visual Studio 2015 RC, specifically looking at switching to the new ASP.NET 5 framework, project structure and the new DNX that runs ASP.NET 5 applications.p  pMy employer has many existing solutions targeting .NET Framework 4.5.2. In our existing Visual Studio solutions we might have the following projectsp  precode[Solution] Sample.sln     [Folder] src         [Project] ClassLibrary.csproj         [Project] WindowsService.csproj         [Project] WebApplication.csproj     [Folder] test         [Project] ClassLibrary.UnitTests.csproj         ... codepre  pIn this scenario, codeClassLibrary.csprojcode is a C class library containing shared code. It is a dependency of  referenced by both codeWindowsService.csprojcode and codeWebApplication.csprojcode.p  pWe arent specifically trying to target .NET Core, codednxcore50code. At this stage we are happy targeting .NET Framework, codednx451code. However we are absolutely trying to leverage the new features of ASP.NET 5 and associated project structure.p  pBelow are some options Ive thought of but both have issues.p  h1Option 1h1  pWhen we replace the codeWebApplication.csprojcode project above with a new ASP.NET 5 DNX project codeWebApplicationdnxcode then we can still reference the codeClassLibrary.csprojcode from both this new DNX project and the  existing codeWindowsService.csprojcode project. However some issues arisep  ol lipThis approach means any changes to code in codeClassLibrary.csprojcode need a rebuild to be visible in the running codeWebApplicationdnxcode. This isnt surprising but means we do not get full compilefromsource benefits for codeWebApplicationdnxcode.pli lipWe cannot easily target other frameworks, e.g. codednxcore50code. As above, this isnt specifically a goal at this stage.pli ol  h1Option 2h1  pIf we replace codeClassLibrary.csprojcode with a DNX class library project codeClassLibrarydnxcode then the problems in option 1 do not apply. This approach would seem to be more inkeeping with the way the .NET runtime and associated technologies such as ASP.NET will be packaged moving forward.p  pHowever I cannot find a way to reference codeClassLibrarydnxcode from codeWindowsService.csprojcode. If this approach is viable I imagine the solution has something to do with the project leveloption for codeProduce outputs on buildcode and then referencing the code.nupkgcode or perhaps even the code.dllcode that is produced during the build. However, I cannot see a clean way of achieving this via the tooling.p  p DNX class library projects are called codeClass Library Packagecode in VS 2015 RC. This project type was previously called codeASP.NET Class Librarycode in the CTPs.p  h1Summaryh1  pBased on the information above Im looking forp  ol lipSome feedback to my scenario options and issues.pli lipSuggestions for other options I have not thought of.pli lipPerhaps an indication of which approach should be used moving forward.pli ol

Negative 7346 pSo I cant seem to find an answer to this, but I am trying to fire bullets into a circle. I have a simple class for a circular path that I attach to a bullet and it reads from that class a position when given a time value. The bullet simply increments this time value, constantly updating its position to the next. This can be improved but until I get the logic down this is what I have. I know this method works because I tried it with a linear path. The problem is applying it to a circular path.p  pI want the bullet to circle around a point say Point Center with a given radius and speed. I want all bullets to travel at the same speed no matter the radius of the circle so a larger circle will take longer to complete than a shorter one. Currently what is happening is I have the CircularPath object giving saying x  r  cost and y  r  sin t where t is in radians, but this is making a circle that increases in speed as the radius increases and the radius and center of this circle is completely off. The bullets are starting in the correct position, except the radius and speeds are off. I hope I am describing this adequately. I will post the code for anyone to inspect.p  precodepackage io.shparki.tetris.go  import io.shparki.tetris.util.Point2D  import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Graphics2D  public class CircularPath extends Path   private  double radius   Where Start is the center and end is the location of mouse  Radius will be distance between the two public CircularPathPoint2D start, Point2D end      superstart, end     radius  normalToEnd.getLength      color  Color.YELLOW   public Point2D getPointAtTimedouble time     double px  start.getX  radius  Math.cosMath.toRadianstime     double py  start.getY  radius  Math.sinMath.toRadianstime     return new Point2Dpx, py  public double getFinalTime  return 0  public CircularPath getClone  return new CircularPathstart.getClone, end.getClone   public void update     super.update      radius  normalToEnd.getLength  public void renderGraphics2D g2d     super.renderg2d      g2d.drawLineintstart.getX, intstart.getY, intend.getX, intend.getY     g2d.drawOvalintstart.getX  radius, intstart.getY  radius, intradius  2, intradius  2  codepre  pp

Negative 7346 pI have an excel 2010 file with 2 columns of formatted text, bold words, italic words, etc..p  pI want to take the contents of those columns, copy them, and manipulate the copy.  Specifically, I want to get rid of certain rows based on criteria run against the first column, and I want to replace certain words in the second column from the rows I keep.p  pThen, I want to take the formatted contents of each row, and insert them into a Word document.  p  pI need to do all of this from Word VBA.p  pI currently have a method minus the formatting  I query the Excel file, copy the column contents into an array of string, manipulate the array, delete certain items and replace certain words and then insert the contents at the end of a word document as paragraphs.  However, this does not maintain any of the formatting bold words, underlined words of the source content.p  pAny ideasp  pThanks. p  p EDIT   p  pActually, even from within Excel VBA, how can I copy the contents of a cell, with formatting, replace words from within the copy  without affecting the source content, and paste the formatted contents into a Word document  I only know of using a string as a holder for a given cells contents, so that I can manipulate the words but that eliminates the formatting.  I dont know where I can stick a copy of the formatted text so that I can manipulate it.p  p UPDATE p  pThe answer is probably going to come from something called building blocks.  A concept introduced in Office 2007, they allow you to store blocks of text in a template file .dotx that can then be brought out.  Im still open to suggestions, but Im going to explore more down this path.p

Even with num1002, they did print all i and q.qsizes. I cannot figure out why. Also, CtrlC causes trace back to p.join.p  pI want to say more about the size problem of queue. a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org3librarymultiprocessing.htmlhighlightjoinmultiprocessing.Process.join relnofollowDocumentation about Queue and its put methoda introduces Queue as Queue[maxsize], and it says about the put method...block if neccessary until a free slot is available. These all make one think that the subprocess is blocked because of running out of spaces of the queue. However, as I mentioned before in the second example, the result printed on the screen proves an increasing qsize, meaning that the queue is not full. I add one linep  precodeprint q.full codepre  pafter the print size statement, it is always false for num10,000 while the program still stuck somewhere. Emphasize one thing top command in another terminal shows no process with command python. That really puzzles me.p  pIm using python 2.7.9.p

When I put the machine name in for the destination and run the batch file myself or with the scheduler it errors.  p  pHere is the action taken by the task  p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comxl7Sq.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxl7Sq.png alt1ap  pHere is the task general tab p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJbEKE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJbEKE.png alt2ap  pAny assistance would be much appreciated.  p

Negative 7346 pI have to build a WebApplication using ASP .NET MVC. It has to serve different customers, each customer accesses the Page via another domain. With this domain the Application is supposed to load the customer specific data. It also has to provide a login mechanism.p  pIm fimiliar with JSF, there I would solve this problem via webfilters.p  pDoes ASP.NET MVC provide something similar to webfilters or is there an even better solution so solve this problemp  pI really wish there was a tutorial or an example that adresses this problem, but after hours of googeling I could not find anything.

Negative 7346 pSomeone told me to use codenpm binPATHcode instead of using the relative path code.nodemodules.bincode in my PATH. This makes it so that every time the PATH is looked at, it will run codenpm bincode and add its value to the PATH for that execution. This is really useful because code.nodemodules.bincode only works when Im in the root of my project, so if Im in a subdirectory it doesnt work.p  pThe issue is that codenpm binPATHcode only works on Linux machines. Does anyone know how to add a dynamic path to the PATH in Windows Is it possiblep
