Positive 1478 pI have found a lot of information about template deduction eg a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31563580ctemplatedfunctionoverloadingrulesC templated function overloading rulesa but it does not help me understand the behaviour of template deduction for an overloaded recursive function. In the following code, I do not really understand how the compiler managed to deduce that it should use the codevectorltTgtcode function two times for codevectvectcode and the codepairltT,Ugtcode two times for codepairpaircode  but it can. Thus, I do not understand why it can not deduce that it should use both codevectorltTgtcode and codepairltT,Ugtcode function for codevectpaircode p  pIs this something to do with why the codeconstcode keyword leads to increase the conversion and thus make the codeTcode function better  But how do the two other examples can work in this case p  pIs the two first deduction only possible because the current function is tested first for the template deduction in a recursive call p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltsstreamgt include ltvectorgt  using namespace std  templateltclass Tgt string printconst Tamp t     ostringstream s     s ltlt t     return s.str   templateltclass Tgt string printconst vectorltTgtamp t     ostringstream s     s ltlt [     forint i0iltintt.sizei         s ltlt printt[i] ltlt       s ltlt ]     return s.str   templateltclass T,class Ugt string printconst pairltT,Ugtamp t     ostringstream s     s ltlt  ltlt printt.first ltlt , ltlt printt.second ltlt      return s.str   int main  int argc, char argv       vectorltvectorltdoublegt gt vectvect4,vectorltdoublegt4     forint i0iltint4i         forint j0jltint4j             vectvect[i][j]  i4j     pairltint,pairltstring,doublegt gt pairpair  makepair10, makepairfoo,0.5     vectorltpairltint,stringgt gt vectpair1,makepair42,bar      template deduction     cout ltlt printvectvect ltlt endl     cout ltlt printpairpair ltlt endl      template deduction failure     gt here is the problem      cout ltlt printvectpair ltlt endl      return 0  codepre  pCurrently, I am just trying to understand, but if somebody knows how to do it without introducing large source overhead, I am interested.p  pThank you.p

Positive 1478 pI would like to know if its possible to create a jqgrid with a footer template for adding new rows as in .net grid view. p  pI dont want bulk updates only single row update and single row insert at a time. For updating records I have seen that inline editing is possible with jqgrid, where I only need to know if I can call the ajax method to update the grid on editing every row and clicking the corresponding save button. Please help me with those two queries.p  pOleg What I intend to have is a row which keeps displaying on every page of the jqgrid. This row must contain input fields Text boxes , and must allow insertion of new rows. It should have a save button at the end of row and when I click it the row should be updated and grid must be bound again.p  pRegarding update  we are not showing whole data in a single instance instead we have given custom pagination using which we fetch data as per requirements, since this is a business Intelligence app lot of data manipulation exists and there is huge data too.p  pHeres the image you asked for p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1AxWS.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1AxWS.png altenter image description hereap  pThat row must be visible to enable users enter data even when on other pages say second or third page of the grid. Here, because we are doing custom pagination I can assume that if once it is created I can make sure I can display it. p  pNotice the save button and reset button. reset is a simple functionality, But for save I want to trigger SP whenever it is clicked, and then reload the grid with uploaded data. p  pI have seen that version 4.0 Inline navigation  a hrefhttpwww.trirand.comblogjqgridjqgrid.html relnofollowhttpwww.trirand.comblogjqgridjqgrid.htmla  in row editing section is what I want though not exactly, but I also want to remove search functionality and paging functionality out of the pager as I have my own search functionality and paging functionality.

Negative 1478 pIve recently gotten charged with designing and implementing a source code version control, testing, and deployment scheme at the company I work.p  pPersonally Ive worked with Subversion for a few years on my own projects. But Ive never dealt with it at this big scale. Hence I thought Id ask here if anyone has any comments or suggestions about the following setup Ive devicedp  ul liTrunk is used as the main development tree, as it should beli liRemote servers testing and production check out code from the SVN repo. ul liTesting servers check out trunk.li liProduction servers checkout the production branch.li ulli liOnce trunk is deemed ready for production, its merged into two branches, stable, and production.li liThe stable branch is a stepping stone to the production branch. If bugs are found once the new code goes live on the production server, the stable branch is used for fixing the bugs, and also testing the bug fixes.li liOnce fixed, changes are merged into the production branch, and also back into trunk where development has kept on going like normal adding new features and whatever independently of any bug fixes that were needed.li ul  pThis way, development doesnt have to halt on trunk whenever theres a production release, as bug fixes arent dependent on trunk. Also, theres always a readonly branch where the latest stable and mostbug free code is available, even in the middle of heavy bug fixing.p  pIf anybody has any suggestions, comments, or otherwise, Id greatly appreciate it p

Negative 1478 pI am wondering if it is possible to leverage the Authentication, Membership, andor Profile provider features in .NET to help integrate .NET web apps into my companys enterprise portal.  In a nutshell, the portal sends custom header values to any application that is behind the portal for fields like the username, user profile data, and some access rights.  One issue that we have with the portal is that we arent able to leverage many of the .NET apps available on the web because they werent designed to be portal aware, primarily to trust that the user has already authenticated.p  pWould it be possible to somehow write a custom authentication provider or maybe leverage forms auth somehow to just look at the header plus the IP and automatically authenticate as that user  My thinking is that by writing a profile provider, possibly a membership provider, and somehow adding authentication I would be able to download cool components like the Oxite blog .net mvc demo that i found, switch providers to my custom one, and leverage it behind my companys portal with minimal code changes.  p  pDoes this make any sense  I feel that I might not be understanding how these components fit into the puzzle.p

Negative 1478 pI need to calculate the logical width of a visual element, before it gets rendered by WPF.  p  pFor simplicity of explanation, Ill say that this visual element will likely be a Polygon object.

I need to be able to calculate the logical width of an element,                unrelated to the WPF rendering system. This means that I cant                rely on FrameworkElement.ActualWidth to calculate the width for                me. I need to be able to look at the MyPolygon object or its                content and figure out that it is set to a visual element that                should be 200dips wide before any parent element applies any                operations to it  regardless of what MyPolygon.Width may or may                not be set to.                 It should also be noted that I dont have to rely on                FrameorkElement. If there are more generic alternatives, such as                the UIElement or Visual classes, Id prefer to use those instead                of the more specific FrameworkElement. The more robust I can make                this, the better.                 codepre

Negative 1478 pI have an appliction right now that is a pipeline design. In one the first stage it reads some data and files into a Stream. There are some intermediate stages that do stuff to the stream of data. And then there is a final stage that writes the stream out to somewhere. This all happens serially, one stage completes and then hands off to the next stage. p  pThis all has been working just great, but now the amount of data is starting to get quite a bit larger hundreds of GB potentially. So Im thinking that I will need to do something to alleviate this. My initial thought is what Im looking for some feedback on being an independent developer I just dont have anywhere to bounce the idea off of. p  pIm thinking of creating a Parallel pipeline. The Object that starts off the pipeline would create all of the stages and kick each one off in its own thread. When the first stage gets the stream to some certain size then it will pass that stream off to the next stage for processing and start up a new stream of its own to continue to fill up. The idea here being that the final stage will be closing out streams as the first stage is building a new ones so my memory usage would be kept lower. p  pSo questions  1 Any high level thoughts on directions for this design  2 Is there a simpler approach that you can think of that might apply here 3 Is there anything existing out there that does something like this that I could reuse not a product I have to buy p  pThanks,p  pMikeDp

Negative 1478 pHaving a very strange issue regarding postback in ASP.NET. I have page dynamically populating DropdownLists on PageLoad, only if its not a postback. I also have several textboxes on the page for user input.p  pIf I postback, either by clicking a submit button or via a SelectedIndexChanged event, the textboxes maintain their values, but the DropdownLists lose all their items  but only IF the page is loaded via an iFrame. If I load the page directly, everything works fine. If I load it via an iFrame, everything but the dropdowns works.p  pHas anyone run into this behavior before I dont think it matters, but Im on Windows7, IIS7, ASP.NET 3.5 and browing with IE8. ViewState is enabled, which is apparent from the textboxes having their values persisted. The ASP.NET page is in a WebApp hosted on localhost. The containing page, with the IFrame tag is just a dummy HTML file sitting on my desktop for testing. Is this perhaps just an IE security issuep  pUPDATE I actually just moved the dummy container page into the Webapp and it seems to work fine, even via the iFrame. Still, Id like to know why this is happening if the containing page is outside the Webapp as I intend on having people load the page in and iFrame via other domains..p

Negative 1478 pWhen building managed code Visual Studio correctly and recursively copies dlls of referenced managed projects to the output folder of the project being build. p  pHowever, if one the of those references is a managed DLL that depends on unmanaged dlls then these unmanaged DLLs are not copied to the output folder, even though their corresponding projects in the same solution and are listed as dependencies of the managed DLL.p  pI realize that this problem can be resolved by having all projects use the same output folder. We already do that for most projects, but we prefer to keep unit test output folders separate, causing the above issue for unit tests that use a managed Dll with unmanaged dependencies.p  pThe solution we are using right now is a prebuild event to copy the necessary DLLs but this wastes time and is errorprone as it needs to be repeated for every project that uses the managed DLL.p  pI would therefore like to know if there is a way to get the build system to understand that it should always copy the unmanaged dependencies of the managed DLL whenever it decides to copy the managed DLLp
Negative 1478 pI am working my way through Ferret Ruby port of Lucene code to solve a bug. Ferret code is mainly a C extension to Ruby. I am running into some issues with the garbage collector. I managed to fix it, but I dont completely understand my fix  I am hoping someone with deeper knowledge of Ruby and C extension this is my 3rd day with Ruby can elaborate. Thanks.p  pHere is the situationp  pSome where in Ferret C code, I am returning a Token to Ruby land. The code looks likep  precodestatic VALUE gettoken ...    ...   RToken token  ALLOCRToken   tokengttext  rbstrnew2some text   return DataWrapStruct..., ampfrttokenmark, ampfrttokenfree, token  codepre  pfrttokenmark calls rbgcmarktokentext   and  frttokenfree just frees the token with  freetokenp  pIn Ruby, this code correlates to the followingp  ptoken  input.nextp  pBasically, input is set to some object, calling the next method on it triggers the gettoken C call, which returns a token object.p  pIn Ruby land, I then do something like   w  token.text.scanwp  pWhen I run this code inside a while 1 loop to isolate my problem, at some point roughly when my ruby process mem footprint goes to 256MB, probably some GC threshold, Ruby dies with errors likep  pscan method called on terminated objectp  pOr just core dumps. My guess was that token.text was garbage collected.p  pI dont know enough about Ruby C extension to know what happens with DataWrapStruct returned objects. Seems to me the assignment in Ruby land, token , should create a reference to it.p  pMy workaroundfix is to create a Ruby instance variable in the object referred to by input, and stores the token text in there, to get an extra reference to it. So the C code looks likep  precodeRToken token  ALLOCRToken tokengttext  rbstrnew2tkgttext  added code prevent garbage collection  rbivarsetinput, idcurtoken, tokengttext return DataWrapStructcToken, ampfrttokenmark, ampfrttokenfree, token codepre  pSo now Ive created a curtoken in the input instance variable, and saved a copy of the text there... Ive taken care to removedelete this reference in the free callback of the class for input.p  pWith this code, it works in that I no longer get the terminated object  error.p  pThe fix seems to make sense to me  it keeps an extra ref in curtoken to the token.text string so an instance of token.text wont be removed until the next time input.next is called at which time a different token.text replaces the old value in curtoken.p  pMy question is why did it not work before Shouldnt DataWrapStructure return an object that, when assigned in Ruby land, has a valid reference and not be removed by Rubyp  pThanks.p

At present, it seems only sun is talking about PKCS11 and browser support for client side certs is difficult to explain quickly.p  pAs a caveat, talking about a browserinternal PKCS11 may be incorrect, or may be a function of PKCS15.

Negative 1478 pI was wondering, what are the advantages and disadvantages of strongKalman Filterstrong and strongExponential Filterstrong I have a multisensor fusion problem and Im trying to decide which method to choose.p  pI think, Kalman filter is more computationally complicated but it has a more detailed model of the system so it is more accurate in multisensor fusion.p  pWhereas the Exponential filter is a simple equation but it is limited by the choice of alpha Higher alpha  less memory of the filter and thus lesser smoothing, but more weightage on measurements whereas lower alpha has higher degree of smoothing but sudden changes are not reflected properly. p  pThe Exponential filter is more useful in noise cancellation, when there is jitter etc. whereas the Kalman filter is useful for the actual multisensor fusion. Is this correctp  pAlso, how useful is the Genetic Algorithm for sensor fusion I am trying to combine a magnetic compass and gyroscope for estimating true orientation. p  pThanksp

Negative 1478 pIve implemented an iPhone App that uses a RESTful HTTP POST to register itself with a web server via Rails.p  pSome time later, the App needs to update its own record on the server, and so needs to know the id of its own record for the RESTful HTTP PUT path.p  pHowever, the App was never told the id of its own record on the web server resulting from the POST. So, it then needs to search for it on the server using the devices UDID stored in the record, return the corresponding id, and then construct a RESTful URL based on that... this all seems rather cumbersome.p  pIs there a more elegant designpattern for this it would be convenient if the original POST returned some data that allowed me to obtain the record id, but it doesnt seem to.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1478 pI hope you can help. Im a PHPmySQL novice and trying to set up a personal site that displays photographs.

I have each type set up as a database table field. For example I have a field for nature and one for urban and I set the row value to true if the photograph satisfies the criteria. p  pAnother issue is I need to add new fields when new categories are encountered. I have set up an admin page to add more columns but this means all the INSERT commands etc have to be dynamic and it is causing me headaches.p  pOut of interest how would you far more seasoned developers approach this p  pThanks in advance for any help.  p

Negative 1478 pI have been using the embedded server that visual studio has to test my ASP.NET MVC 3 application and it has been working fine.  I decided that I want to start using IIS on my local machine for my personal development environment as that is how the application is going to have to be deployed.p  pI installed IIS through the control panel on Windows 7 so I am assume it is version 77.5 and enabled basically every option.  I then open up the IIS Manager and added the website.  I also added an entry in my hosts file so that the domain I gave the IIS Manager maps to 127.0.0.1.p  pI then started Visual Studio as administrator and opened up the solution.  I changed the properties for a few of the references as mentioned in a How to Web Deploy ASP.NET Applications article like System.Web.MVC, System.web.Routing, and a few others.  I then went to the main project, rightclicked and clicked publish.  I set everything in there for Web Deploy and published it.  To double check I when to the folder that I set as the path for the website in IIS Manager and they was a folder called app as excepted when publishing I gave it websiteapp so I was excepting that folder and it had a number of different files.p  pstrongEditedstrongbr At first I was getting a blank page.  After restarting my server, I now get a page with the messagep  pError Summary HTTP Error 403.14  Forbidden The Web server is configured to not list the contents of this directory.p  pIt tells me the most likely issue is that directory browseing is not enable but I would have though that my application would be access from the url sb.website.comapp.  The only files that publish copied over into that folder is the Web.config and Global.asax it also copied the folder Areas, bin, and Views.  Is there some setting in IIS Manager I am missing something else that should be copied over in the publishp

Negative 1478 pI have inline javascript within my HTML. Each individual component that requires animation or action sliders, expanding text areas, etc. each have their own inline script, that sets up the animation and such for that individual component.p  pThe way i have it set up, Each script is position dependent it references its own position in the DOM, and traverses it to find the component it wants to manipulate e.g. add onclick to the parent div. This is normally an incredibly bad idea for several reasonsp  ul lihaving to repeat the same code all over the place, losing DRYli libeing very verbose, repeating the same chunk of text over and over, taking up bandwidthli licluttering up your HTML with a bunch of inline scripts, making it hard to readli ul  pHowever, the second problem is easily solved with GZIP, and i have solved the first and last problem. p  pThis has the advantage of locality of reference the component and the scripts they require are kept in one place, not spread out over separate files. Also, I isolate each set of scripts in a function, and avoid polluting the global namespace, so each set of scripts for each component is written once and doesnt interact with scripts written elsewhere at all. Perfect modularityp  pSo the question is, how can i stop JQuery eating my script tags when i do Ajax DOM insertionsreplacements If it didnt eat my scripts, because each component is completely selfcontained with its own scripts, i can simply run every script tag in the new components DOM and that would be that everything will be set up. No more fiddling with decided which global scripts need to be rerun depending on which component changed. p  pHowever, since JQuery seems to insist on stripping my script tags and moving them somewhere, this no longer works. I could do the insertion by modifying replacing the HTML of the entire document, but that causes the whole screen to flash as it reflows among other problems. Any ideasp

So, essentially Ive been able to isolate my dev environment on a VM, which makes it easy for the entire dev team to be on the same environment irrespective of their host OS  setting, etc. While, it certainly has made everything easy, Im stuck with a specific problem occurring due to sprockets I guess.

Negative 1478 pIn recent years I have been working on web applications written in Java using the Spring MVC framework. The projects have good test coverage with JUnit amp Selenium. However on two occasions errors in the Spring Configuration have got through the testing process. p  pIn one case a change was made to a parent bean in controllerContext.xml which also required a change to the two inheriting beans. But the required change was only made to one of the two inheriting beans. The error was only visible in a small, but critical, part of the Web application. Selenium UA tests were later extended to check this directly in the Web App. prior to deployment, but the damage had already been done as the error made it into the live environment.p  pIn another case a property required to set the data format was not being injected properly via the applicationContext.xml. The only visible error was in the date format of a generated report downloaded from the web app. Difficult to test with Selenium.p  pOne of the advantages of using Spring MVC is the ability to set the injected objects in your JUnit tests i.e. a mock object, but this doesnt tell you what you are actually going to get injected when the Application is running in the live environment.p  pThe answer may be integration testing, however setting up amp running integration testing has proved to be difficult in the past ... but thats another question ...p  pSo, Id be really interested in learning how people have tried to catching possible errors introduced into Spring configuration files.p  pSo my question isp  pstrongWhat is the best way to test for errors in the Spring Configurationstrongp

Negative 1478 pIve been working on a VB.NETVS2008AJAXSQL Server project for over 2 years now without any real issues coming up.  However, were in the last week of our project doing some heavy stress testing and the project starts failing once I get about 150 simultaneous users.   Ive even gone so far as to create a stripped down version of the site which only logs in a user, pulls up their profile and then logs off.   That still fails under stress.  When I says fails I mean the CPUs are spiked and the App Pool eventually crashes.   This is running on a Windows 2008 R2 duo quad server w 16 gig of memory.  The memory never spikes but the CPU tops out. p  pI ran YSlow on the site and it pointed out that I needed to compress the .axd files, etc...  I did that by implementing Gzip compression on everything but thats what got me to the 150 users.  I run YSlow now and it says everything is A.p  pIm really not sure where to go from here.  Id be more than willing to share the stripped down version of the site for anyone to review.  Im not sure if its the server, my code or the web.config.p

Negative 1478 pMy requirement is for some kind of scheduler, where i can register a callback with it and tell the scheduler to invoke the callback after a specified time period.

Negative 1478 pAt first, sorry for my bad english.p  pI am using Uploadify with image cropper to upload and choose your own thumb, but I need to do a multi upload, not single. Now Im trying to send before each upload  onSelect scriptData to server, but it send only one name, or rewriting it somewhere I tried change name of parameter, reset scriptData but with no effect. Problem is, that name of file must generate Javascript, which will send it to server second option is do it by ajax, because Javascript then show the thumb.p  pstrongEDITstrong Link is not working, if

Negative 1478 pI use the web.sitemap of my ASP.net application to help build my navigation links.  This way if my navigation changes, I update the web.sitemap, and it builds my navigation automatically.  However since upgrading from ASP.net 3.5 to 4.0 Im having problems related to my web.sitemap file.  After upgrading to ASP.net 4.0 the links generated from my web.sitemap sometimes have strange characters inserted after the domain name link broken on purpose because my limit is 2p  phttp www.cheatsheetwarroom.comAjUhJqoX4zAEkAAAAN2VlZTM2N2MtOWU5Mi00OWUyLTllZTUtMTY4MDY3ZGM2MTM2hMRoHFFNSDvXxMDadonaHu8pk1fantasyfootballnflfreerankingsoffenserunningbacks.aspxp  pYou can see this by hovering over links on my a hrefhttpwww.cheatsheetwarroom.comsitemap.aspxSitemap pagea if its broken while you happen to view it.p  pstrongThe problem caused by this is that the following method which takes in the url of a sitemap node as its parameter begins to return NULL for any nodes throughout my application, even if I point to nodes that I know are in my web.sitemap filestrongp  precodeSiteMapNode myNode  SiteMap.Provider.FindSiteMapNodefantasyfootballnflfreerankingsplayerrankings.aspx codepre  pThis is presumably because the funky urls generated by the web.sitemap no longer match the explicit nodes Im looking for.  Since many of my menu controls are based on comparing the current page to nodes in the web.sitemap file, much of my navigation breaks.  When reverting back to ASP.net 3.5, everything works again.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5900035sitemappathstopsdisplayinginaspnet4this suggested solutiona on Stack Overflow which suggests the problem is related to cookieless mode.  However, as you can see in my web.config below Im forcing the use of cookies.  So, either the suggested fix does not entirely work or Im not correctly forcing the use of cookies.

Negative 1478 pI have a situation while developing a WPF MVVM application. After some extensive searching Ill try to explain the experienced behaviour on SO, and hope someone has a solution.p  pThe WPF application under development, has a reference to a local developed Infrastructure assembly. This assembly mainly consists of classes to commmunicate with our WCF services. p  pThis assembly has a assembly reference to a second assembly, Ninject.Extensions.WCF, whoose content is used in some functionalities.p  pWhen I include a reference to the Infrastructure assembly, i get a VS2010 designer error that it cannot find the Ninject.Extensions.WCF assembly within a couple of seconds after triggering a local build.p  pThis all makes sense because the designer probably traverses all referenced assemblies for definitions.p  pIn this particular case, the assembly its trying to load has nothing to do with WPF, so I can live with the designer not trying to resolve the assembly.p  pIs there a way to tell the designer to ignore these missing referenced assemblies instead of throwing an exceptionp

Dim openId As New OpenIdRelyingParty     Call googleapi.GetClientCredentialsVars.Servername     Dim NewURL As UriBuilder  New UriBuilderRequest.Url.ToString     Dim AuthRequest As IAuthenticationRequest  openId.CreateRequestgoogleapi.OpenIDLoginURL, NewURL.Uri, NewURL.Uri     AuthRequest.RedirectToProvider  End Sub codepre  pThis works, and I was able to get the claimed identifier back.  The problem that I have no is that I have absolutely no idea what the heck Im supposed to do with it, and I cant find anything anywhere that I can follow along and more or less make my own.p  pIdeally, what Im looking for is a code sample that isnt necessarily complete, but is at least coherent enough that I can get where I want to go.  Failing that, an explanation thats dumbed down about three shades from the normal level will suffice.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1478 pIm trying to get a correctly rotated codeUIImagecode from an codeALAssetRepresentationcode using the codefullScreenImagecode method.

When I replace code[rep orientation]code with codeUIImageOrientationUpcode, the image is fine for all testing photos. Obviously Im hesitating to stick with this solution, as it feels like a hack.

Negative 1478 pWhen I declare an event, Ive been using the codeActioncode delegate or codeActionltT, ...gtcode delegate if the event handler has parameters.

I tried replacing the .striped target with the ID of the table and then it works, but this function needs to be applied to multiple table IDs.p  pAnyone ideas folksp
Negative 1478 pI have an odd problem. I use WCF RIA with Entity Framework. Ive implemented a generic search functionality, which relies on sending back the resulting entities as codebyte[]code enter Json.Net and Im able to get around all sorts of limitations of strong typedness of RIA. But when Im deserializing back in the client, my object is not properly assembled.  Now what do I mean by that p  pThe json, technically a string, converted to codebyte[]code by me and back on the client, contains the related entity information I need. So lets suppose the entity is called Account and it has a related Person object. The json string , even the deserialized jobject, has this Person object and its details. However, when I deserialize like codeJsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltAccountgtjdata, settingscode  Person is null with no errors.p  pThe settings Im trying are herep  precodesettings  new JsonSerializerSettings      CheckAdditionalContent  true,     PreserveReferencesHandling  PreserveReferencesHandling.All,     ReferenceLoopHandling  ReferenceLoopHandling.Serialize     NullValueHandling  NullValueHandling.Ignore,     DefaultValueHandling  DefaultValueHandling.Ignore,     ObjectCreationHandling  ObjectCreationHandling.Replace,     TypeNameHandling  TypeNameHandling.Auto    codepre  pAny ideasp

Negative 1478 pI am planning to build a new very fast developer computer under Visual Studio 2012 and Windows 7 64 bit. I am getting all fast components like SSDs and 16G RAM.

Negative 1478 pI have a HTML form that accepts a comma separated list of tags, which works just like the one here on stackoverflow. I also have a MySQL table that contains lists of tags that belong to each user. The user can update their tags in their profile, so what I would like to do is automatically remove any tags from the MySQL table if it no longer exists in the listp  pFor example, the user enters the following on the web formp  precodetrance, house, electronica, dubstep, club codepre  pThe MySQL table however, has thisp  precodeuserid    tag 1         trance 1         house 1         electronica 1         dubstep 1         garage codepre  pI would like to remove the garage tag from MySQL and add club instead.p  pstrongIt is also worth notingstrong that while these tags appear in order in my example above, this wont always be the case, so I cant rely on the array index position in both, for example.p  pI realise I could probably loop through the comma separated list with a foreach and generate a delete statement, and reinsert all the tags from scratch but I feel that there is probably a better way to do this.p  pThanks in advance for your guidance.p  pDavep

Negative 1478 pIm working on an application that makes a lot of usage of AJAX capabilities. Im currently working on a page where there are a large number of ajax calls made to render an initial page. All these calls are routed through the same AJAX script, so they have to be made one at a time by the browser. Yeah, its a bit inefficientp  pIve got an event that loads another page, but unfortunately it needs to make an ajax call before it can rerender the page. The result of this is that if a user clicks on that link right when the page is first loading, the browser waits for all other ajax calls before making the call to rerender the page according to the event raised by the users click. This has been resulting in some noticeably slow load times for the page when clicking on the link to it right as the page is loading.p  pMy question is strongIs there a way to use Javascript or something to have the web browser cancel http calls to a web script so that another event can then make a call to that same scriptstrong I know that it would be nice to make each call to different scripts so they could happen concurrently, but unfortunately the application Im working on funnels all ajax requests through a central script, and thats not going to change anytime soon.p

Negative 1478 pAlright heres the deal. I got two Galaxy Nexus phones both with bluetooth enabled.p  pIve written a bluetooth connection management app that I use for device discovery and connectivity. It also outputs all the available UUIDs the devices can support.p  pLooking from a hrefhttpwww.bluetooth.orgTechnicalAssignedNumbersservicediscovery.htm relnofollowhttpwww.bluetooth.orgTechnicalAssignedNumbersservicediscovery.htma the following standard UUIDs are exposed from Galaxy Nexus devices.p  ul li0x1116  NAPli li0x112f  PBAP Phonebook Access Profileli li0x111f  HFP Hands freeli li0x1105  OPP Object Push Profileli li0x1112  HSP Headset Profileli li0x110c  AVRCPli li0x110a  A2DPli ul  pI am trying to connect via the OPP profile codeUUID 0000110500001000800000805F9B34FBcode and push objects files between the devices. Ive gone though the entire a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitybluetooth.html relnofollowAndroid API documentationa on how to discover, pairbond threading etc. and manage all bluetooth connections. Ive managed to successfully connect and talk to a legacy board device via the SPP 0x1101 profile.p  pHowever, when I try to use codesocket.connectcode between the two galaxy nexus phones, the pairing dialog shows up and I click codePaircode button on both devices. After that, I immediately get a codeConnection Refused IOExceptioncode. Note that after pairing has occurred once I never get asked again which makes sense since the secure link is cached.p  pIf I cant connect to these standard profiles using these standard UUIDs why are they exposed How can I connect from my app to any of these profiles and interact with them Is it because my app is not somehow trusted Whats weird is that even the codeSharecode functionality on Android does not work at all either. Is this something completely broken on Androidp  pPlease avoid giving me hints to use the well known UUID SPP one 0x1101 like the docs say. This is not what I want. I have a fairly good understanding of how this stuff works and I am looking for a real solution or explanation of the problem.p  pIve seen the typical reflection solution but I do not understand why is this still a problem on Android Why do people use reflection to make this work Can we file a bug on Android to fix thisp  pIf those UUIDs are standard any app should be able to connect and interact with them. Why is this an issue and why do I get this exceptionp  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo for some reason the object push in the Android system started working. I actually attempted to connect via my app and it was not working. Then, I went to the Contacts app and tried to share a contact which magically worked. Then, I went back to my app and it now it works...wow. That is very weird and there must be an explanation to this.p

I looked in the Rails Guide section on routing, and the only thing that looked similar to what I want is Nested Models, but I ideally dont want to nest the models, because while items may technically belongto fixers, thats not really the case in the real world fixers are just associated, and belongto was the most sensible way, and theres no other part of the relationship that requiresmakes sense with nesting. More importantly, I dont really get what nesting the models means or does, and I try to avoid implementing solutions that I dont fully understand. p  pIf nestings the way to go, let me know, but otherwise, how might I go about routing this Ive tried this in my routes.rb filep  precodematch fixersidlogid gt fixerslog codepre  pand created log.html.erb, but I dont know how Id select the params of that in a controller how does it know which id Im selecting for Is there a better way to do thisp  pThanksp

Negative 1478 pI have designed a database with many reports of certain importance. Basically a report in my DB is one of two types a Daily Report requires a single criteria which is the date and the second is a History report.  To view or print a report, I have designed a Filter form to fill in with the report criteria and clicking a button to open the report.The first type Daily R work fine without problems.p  pThe second type History Rhas a problem. In this report, the criteria are two or three because a history report will retrieve data within a period, so I have to input FromDate and ToDateand may be adding another criteria which is called a company. In all history reports, the report header will accomodate the two input values of date and extract the rest of report items into the reprot detail area.p  pThe problem is, the desigened system doesnot respond well as expected. When I load the filter form to fill in criteria for a history report, I have input the FromDate and ToDate and selected the third criteria if any, then, the reprot opens without data in it.on the other hand, I tried to load the report directly form opening it, inputing criteria, and it has worked fine without probelms.p  pWould someone expect a key reason for this problem or dirtecly can solve this problemp  pAppreciate youtr support.p  pThanks in Advance. mhegazyp

Negative 1478 pI am writing an Android app that has a data type that represents a person specifically, the parent or guardian of a child. Id like to be able to import the relevant data fields from the Contacts database in the Android device. This should be optional that is, it will not be a requirement that the parentguardian is already in the Contacts database, nor will the Contacts database be updated if they add new parentsguardians.p  pSo far, I have written code to start a new Intent to choose the specific Contact using Intent.ACTIONPICK.

Negative 1478 pThis is all in the context of JBox2D in Java.  The World class creates Body instances with a function.  Im trying to add a bit more stuff to Body for my application.  Body is represented by ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI in this question.  p  pHere is the generalized question.  I am trying to add a bit more functionality to a premade class by extending the class.  I hope to do something like thisp  precodeclass SomeMore extends ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI     int myExtraInt     A bit more API functions  codepre  pSo that I may do thisp  precodeSomeMore smnew SomeMore sm.someOldAPI sm.butAlsoMyNewAPI codepre  pThe problem is that this ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI is created by another class that I cant modify the World class in the original context, so I am not simply creating them on my own otherwise this would work.  Since I am stuck having to start with a ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI, I have been searching for a way to emconstructem a SubClass from a SuperClass, whereas there are many examples of emcastingem a SuperClass to a Subclass but this is not applicable here.  Here is an example of the function that needs to be completedp  precodepublic SomeMore create...      ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI ccwlaomyWorld.create...     SomeMore sm          return sm  codepre  pstrongAlternative to Wrappingstrong My original solution was to encase the ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI into my own class.  In order to construct my new class, I simply pass the old class into my new constructor and move onp  precodeclass SomeMore     public ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI ccwloa     int myExtraInt     public SomeMoreComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI nccwloa         ccwloanccwloa         myExtraInt0          A bit more API functions  public SomeMore create...      ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI ccwlaomyWorld.create...     SomeMore smnew SomeMoreccwlao     return sm     OR more simply     return new SomeMoremyWorld.create...  codepre  pBut in order to access the old API, I need to do thisp  precodeSomeMore smnew SomeMore sm.ccwloa.someOldAPI sm.butAlsoMyNewAPI codepre  pI could just be a bit unreasonable, but this kind of functionality is tedious and adds just that much more complication to something that doesnt need it.  I mean, if someone wanted to add a tad more functionality, would they wrap my class into yet another class, and have 3 class heirarchies to go through to get old APIs  Also, it would feel just wasteful to wrap every single API in the old class into my new class theres a lot of them.p  precodesm.someOldAPIButWrappedInMyClass not desirable codepre  pI do not have access to the java files of ComplexClassWithLotsOfAPI, only the compiled class files.  I can not simply force my modifications into the old class and even if I could, Id prefer not to anyway.  I am relatively new to java, so perhaps this is not the bestproper way to do this, but I havent been able to find an alternative.p

Negative 1478 pThis post corresponds to your answer on my previous post...p  pBefore I upload a simple project for you, let me try something else I noticed that when I swap the Points Series with a ColorGrid series the same thing happens, BUT, when I then with the ColorGrid Series use MyColorGrid.YValues[gridPosition]  val instead of MyColorGrid.AddX, Y, Z then it works. Is there a way I can use the Points Series in the same way, ie, allocate all the points the first time, and then just use XValues[idx]  x, and YValues[idx]  y to update the points The problem seems to happen when I use the Add method, together with the Clear method. When I just update the values with XValues and YValues etc. the problem seems to be solved The thing is, I can not get it to work on a Points Series...it was easy with the ColorGrid Seriesp  precode            for int r  0 r lt 128 r                              for int d  0 d lt 128 d                                                     MyColorGrid.YValues[d  128  r]  somevalue                                            MyColorGrid.BeginUpdate             MyColorGrid.EndUpdate codepre  pQuestion 1 How do I achieve the same for the Points Series Question 2 If I succeed, how do I cleardelete points, without again having to Addx, y them afterwards Question 3 Is this the best way to use BeginUpdateEndUpdate Whats the difference In general, what are the differences between all the available update methods, and how do I choose the correct one  A few examples p  precodeMyColorGrid.RefreshSeries MyColorGrid.Repaint MyTChart.Refresh MyTChart.AutoRepaint codepre  pRegardsp  pJDp

Negative 1478 pI need to preserve the aspect ratio of a div when the browser window is resized.p  pI have done a good bit of searching on this, and it is possible to use padding to preserve the aspect ratio of a div by making its height relative to its width, whenever the width of the screen is altered.p  pThe technique is shown a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1495407cssawaytomaintainaspectratiowhenresizingadivherea on Stack Overflow, and in particular, this a hrefhttpjsbin.comeqeseb2edit relnofollowlinked toa example shows the technique in action.p  pBut I need to do the opposite. Rather than making the height relative to the width of the div, I need the width of the div to change whenever the height of the browser window is altered. I need to do this because I have a background image that I want the content to flow relative to, and that background image has a 100 height, and its aspect ratio is preserved.p  pI have tried using linked method, but swapping horizontal for vertical attributes. It isnt working. I have no idea why. Perhaps someone can show how to do this.p

Negative 1478 pBusiness Logic Layer contains business objects that contains business logic. Some of them are persistent, those are Entities. Entities along with its logic make Model.

Negative 1478 pi am currently migrating from hibernate 3 to 4. I managed to sort out the dependencies but i am facing the popular  org.hibernate.QueryException query specified join fetching, but the owner of the fetched association was not present in the select list... issue . I used to do the below in order to force hibernate to fetch the entire object and its collection properties i.e. an Employee with many Departments and the address of each department.p  pSo in hql i had something like p  pselect e from Employee as e left join fetch e.department left join fetch e.department.address where e.id ....p  pThis worked fine but in new hibernate i can only fetch the properties that belong directly to the employee object and not the department. So what i would like is to get all properties because the session is closed after the query and lazy obviously raises an exception.p  pI would really appreciate your help in sorting this out.p  pKind Regardsp

Negative 1478 pConsider theres a BST which has duplicate elements. You have to remove all the duplicate elements from the tree. The insertion in the BST when an equal key is found is random i.e, while inserting a key in the tree, if the said key is already present, the key can be inserted in either the left subtree or the right subtree, but still following the basic property of the BST. So all the keys on the left subtree of any node is less than or equal to the node and the keys on the right subtree of any node is greater than or equal to the node. How would you delete all the duplicate elements. p  pPlease note, that if a key say for example 15 appears thrice in the entire tree, we dont remove all three instances, but delete just two, it doesnt matter which two. p  pThere is the brute force approach of traversing the tree in PreOrder fashion. Then find and delete elements, on the left and the right subtree, which have their key equal to the said node.p  pIs there a better way to solve this problem p

Negative 1478 pHow do you work with single precision floats in x86 assembler during run time. i know you can use the .float assembler directive to include static floating point numbers during compile time, but how would you handle say a user entering a floating point number in base 10 and using it in your code.p  pive done some reading over the last 2 days and converting the base 10 floats to and from the exponent and massisia make sense, but do i actually have to code a function to convert them back and forth to use them with floperators floating point operators such as fadd, fdiv.p  pif so i guess i have to suck it up and create two functions to go back and forth from decimal to exponent massisia hex. p  pif not are there operations or instructions that do this for me if so what are they or if you could link me to a document page on them.p  pthanks for your time and hopefully this post made sense.p

Negative 1478 pI have an application that takes user input, validates it, and either shows an error screen or continues to the next page. p  pWhen an error is thrown it calls a static method and passes a resource key for the error message. This static method launches a new window which is top most. p  pThe issue is that this error window runs in its own thread. In the main window where the user had input, I call focus on a codetextboxcode. This is so when the user starts typing again, it actually types in the text box. When I call focus on the text box though, it also places the error window behind the Main window.p  pHow can I codeFocuscode on the textbox without stealing codetopmostcode from the error windowp
Negative 1478 pI am trying to follow YSLOWs guidelines to optimize my site.

Wouldnt that cause cookies to be enabled  Is this an eitheror case or is it possible to host static content on a cookie free domain AND add expire headers If so, howp

Negative 1478 pI have a model called profile that hasmany jobs.  I am using the cocoon gem in order to allow users to make a profile, and then on a separate page make as many jobs as theyd like.  The profile form is working fine.  The job form, however, doesnt seem to actually be creating the jobs.

Should I be doing things differently, a different table structure maybe How would you go about thisp

Negative 1478 pThe basic operation I have is an operation on two probability vectors of the same length.  lets call them A,B. in R the formula is  p  precodet  1prod1AB codepre  pthat is, the result is a scalar, the code1ABcode is a pointwise operation, whose result is a vector whose ith element is code1aibicode. The codeprodcode operator gives the product of the elements of the vector.br The meaning of this as you could guess is this suppose A is the probability for each of N sources of a disease or other signal to have a certain disease. B is the vector of probabilities for each of sources to transmit the disease, if they have it, to the target. The outcome is the probability of the target to acquire the disease from at least one of the sources.  p  pOk, so now I have many types of signals, so I have many A vectors. and for each type of signal I have many targets, each with different probability of transmission or many B vectors, and I want to compute the t outcome for each pair.br Ideally, a matrix multiplication can do the trick if the operation was an inner product of the vectors. but my operation is not such I think.  p  pWhat I look for is some kind of a transformation on the vectors A and B, so I could use matrix multiplication. Any other suggestion to simplify my computation is welcome.p  pHere is an example code in Rp  precodeA  rbindc0.9,0.1,0.3,c0.7,0.2,0.1 A   that is, the probability of source 2 to have diseasesignal 1 is 0.1 A[1,2]  neither rows nor columns need to sum to 1. B  cbindc0,0.3,0.9,c0.9,0.6,0.3,c0.3,0.8,0.3,c0.4,0.5,1 B  that is, the probability of target 4 to acquire a disease from source 2 is 0.5 B[2,4]  again, nothing needs to sum to 1 here   the outcome should be C  tapplyA,1,functionx applyB,2,functiony 1prod1xy  which basically loops on every row in A and every column in B and   computes the required formula C  while this is quite elegant, it is not very efficient, and I look for transformations  on my A,B matrices so I could write, in principle  C  fAgB, where fA is my transformed A, gB is my transformedB,  and  is matrix multiplication   note that if replace 1prod1xy in the formula above with sumxy, the result  is exactly matrix multiplication, which is why I think, Im not too far from that  and want to enjoy the benefits of already implemented optimizations of matrix  multiplications. codepre

Just curious if its possible.p  pOkay, so the code Id like to use is as followsp  precodeltdiv idcontainergt     ltp styletextaligncentergtCSS3 TABS. ltbgtltigtNO JAVASCRIPT ltigtltbgtltpgt     ltdiv idtabsgt         ltulgt             ltli idOnegtlta hrefOne idfirstgtOneltagt                 ltdivgt                     ltpgtp1ltpgt                 ltdivgt             ltligt             ltli idTwogtlta hrefTwo idsecgtTwoltagt                 ltdivgt                     ltpgtp2ltpgt                 ltdivgt             ltligt             ltli idThreegtlta hrefThree idthirdgtThreeltagt                 ltdivgt                     ltpgtp3ltpgt                 ltdivgt             ltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltstronggtCSSltstronggt li div      moztransition all 0.5s ease 0s     webkittransition all 0.5s ease 0s     border 1px solid 888888     float left     opacity 0     padding 0 15px     position absolute     visibility hidden     width 250px     left0     background mozlineargradientcenter top , E3E3E3, FFFFFF 85px repeat scroll 0 0 transparent   tabs li a     background mozlineargradientcenter top , E3E3E3, FFFFFF 18px repeat scroll 0 0 transparent     border 1px solid 888888     margin 0 3px 0 0     padding 5px 25px     position relative     zindex1     fontsize 14px     borderradius10px 10px 0 0     displayblock     top1px   Onetarget div, Twotarget div, Threetarget div     opacity1     visibilityvisible  codepre  pSo far, Ive converted everything but the codetargetcode part.p  precodeltdiv idcontainergt     ltp styletextalign centergtTestltpgt     ltdiv idtabsgt         ltulgt             ltli idOnegt             lta hrefOne idfirst             style             background mozlineargradientcenter top , E3E3E3, FFFFFF 18px repeat scroll 0 0 transparent             border 1px solid 888888 margin 0 3px 0 0 padding 5px 25px position relative zindex1             fontsize 14px borderradius10px 10px 0 0 displayblock top1px             gt             Oneltagt                 ltdiv stylemoztransition all 0.5s ease 0s webkittransition all 0.5s ease 0s border 1px solid 888888                 float left opacity 0 padding 0 15px position absolute visibility hidden width 250px left0                 background mozlineargradientcenter top , E3E3E3, FFFFFF 85px repeat scroll 0 0 transparentgt                     ltpgtPage 1ltpgt                 ltdivgt             ltligt             ltli idTwogt             lta hrefTwo idsec             style             background mozlineargradientcenter top , E3E3E3, FFFFFF 18px repeat scroll 0 0 transparent             border 1px solid 888888 margin 0 3px 0 0 padding 5px 25px position relative zindex1             fontsize 14px borderradius10px 10px 0 0 displayblock top1px             gt             Twoltagt                 ltdiv stylemoztransition all 0.5s ease 0s webkittransition all 0.5s ease 0s border 1px solid 888888                 float left opacity 0 padding 0 15px position absolute visibility hidden width 250px left0                 background mozlineargradientcenter top , E3E3E3, FFFFFF 85px repeat scroll 0 0 transparentgt                     ltpgtPage 2ltpgt                 ltdivgt             ltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre
Negative 1478 pIm stumped. I have a widget inside the mainwindow on a QT 4.6 application which has been configured as a openGL widget. It draws just fine except I am unable to clear the background between frames. I get a black background when he window opens and it never clears after that, so I get a jumbled mess of rendered objects as time goes along. Im also having to call swapBuffers at the end of the paintGL function to get the widget to show the most recent frame which has me puzzled as I was under the impression that swapBuffers was called automatically. I am set up for double buffering and the widget is not shared. Here is the relevant codep  precodevoid GLWidgetpaintGL        mInput.Draw     QGLWidgetswapBuffers   void GLWidgetinitializeGL        qglClearColorQColor0,0,255,128     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  codepre  pIt does seem theres something not right with the double buffering. Clearing the screen to a background color is pretty basic. But its driving me nuts as to why its not working. The remainder of the drawing code is working fine. Any ideas This is on a Linux system.p

Where is the replacement for that tab in version 12p

Negative 1478 pIn my project I use Maven to package a web application to a WAR which is later deployed to Jetty using a custom Maven plugin on CentOS. The custom plugin is used by every project that deployes to a production environment. There is now a requirement that all static content like web site text, properties is packed outside of the WAR so that it can be changed in production without requiring a new release cycle. I am unsure how to achieve this externalization. p  pThe Jetty server has the directory structure described in a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgjettydocumentationcurrentquickstartgettingstarted.html relnofollowJetty quick start guidea. Currently, the web application already offers emsomeem code.propertiescode files which can be altered externally, and these reside in the coderesourcescode directory. These files are moved here by the custom Maven plugin. The WAR resides in the codewebappcode folder. One option for my problem is to use codeltpackagingExcludesgtcode of codemavenwarplugincode to not include e.g. code.xhtmlcode and code.propertiescode in the WAR. Later, I can use the custom Maven plugin to move excluded files to coderesourcescode directory. But, I have a feeling this is not the correct way to externalize static content... Shouldnt xhtml files live in codewebappcode folder while the only the properties file live in coderesourcescode folderp  pI have also researched the option of deploying the WAR as exploded, but I am unsure of the implications of such. Clearly, the changes in the exploded WAR files will be overwritten in the next deploy, but the idea is to do static changes both in development and production. Also, I am not sure how to achieve WAR explosion, is it something that Jetty does for your WAR if configured in codejetty.xmlcode or do I have to extract the WAR before deployingp  pLastly, how do people serve static content in Jetty which can be altered in production Do both the WAR and static files live side by sidep

Negative 1478 pI would like to use broadcasting to use values from one array lower dimension to mask another array higher dimension.p  pAn example would bep  precodea np.arange9.reshape3,3 b np.arange3 codepre  pwhat I tried isp  precodecnp.ma.maskedwhereb[,np.newaxis]gt1, a codepre  pbut it fails with codeIndexError Inconsistant[sic] shape between the condition and the input got3,1 and 3,3codep  pwhich is perplexing since broadcasting should apply here and codebcode should broadcast onto codeacode.

Negative 1478 pI have an application in App store that is designed to control a hardware device using an HTTP server and WiFi router in the device. Now I am planning to release another version of the same application with an extra scheduling feature. That is an extra tab will be added to the application. And I am planning to release this as a separate application in Appstore. I will use the same app icon and except one I am planning to use the same screen shots for all the other screens. Now I doubt if there is any chance for the app to get rejected at the time of submission to app store. I could not find a specific answer from Apple develper sites. Please share youe thoughts.p

Negative 1478 pIm building a form manager for my framework and want to add methods to create form elements based on parameters passed.

These 2 containers may have different background colours so I need to ensure that the stretch to the bottom of the controlcontainer and also keep in consideration that the validation div might show so using position absolute and top 0 might not work.p  pI have tried the followingp  ul liGiving controlcontainer a relative position and the 2 seperate containers both a position absolute. As the height of the containers would mostly be dictated by the height of the label if the label is multiple lines or if the elementcontainer has multiple elements within it this option does not work.li liFloats There I say more Dli ul  pI would prefer a CSS solution which is compatible with most browsers including IE8 am I pushing it to ask for IE7 hahap  pAny ideasp  p ADDITIONAL INFORMATION p  pI want the layout to look something like thisp  precode  controlcontainer   [Potential validation message this will be toggled onoff ]  [labelcontainer][ elementscontainer                       ]   end of controlcontainer  codepre  pSo labelcontainer with the label and elementscontainer with its elements will be next to eachother. These 2 containers may have different background colours so they should both stretch height according to the biggest element. The only issue I see here is validation element which wont show by default so using absolute positioning might not work as the validation message might take the top area and have the elements overlap eachother.p

Negative 1478 pI have the following problem. When I use Three.js point light like this p  precode var color  0xffffff     var intensity  0.5  var distance  200  positionx  0  positiony  0  positionz  0   light  new THREE.PointLightcolor, intensity, distance   light.position.setpositionx, positiony, positionz  scene.addlight codepre  pIt works as expected when there is a small object mesh positioned close to the light on the scene. However, when there is a large object let us say a floor p  precode var floorTexture  new THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture floor.jpg   floorTexture.wrapS  floorTexture.wrapT  THREE.RepeatWrapping   floorTexture.repeat.set 1, 1  var floorMaterial  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial  map floorTexture, side THREE.DoubleSide    var floorGeometry  new THREE.PlaneGeometry1000, 1000, 10, 10   var floor  new THREE.MeshfloorGeometry, floorMaterial  floor.position.y  0.5  floor.rotation.x  Math.PI  2  scene.addfloor codepre  pThen the light will not be shown on it. At first I thought it is due to the fact that the floor center is positioned further away from the point light so the point light cannot reach it with the distance set to 200 even though part of the floor is closer than the mentioned distance. Therefore I have tryied to increase this distance  no luck. p  pThere is a workaround to create a floor out of small parts. Then the point light again works as expected but there is a problem with this approach  namely it drastically decreases FPS due to the large number of floor objects to be rendered.p  pMy guess is that I am missing something. I know that there are other types of light which cover the whole scene but I am trying to create a lamp, so I think I need to use a point light. But I might be wrong. Any help or hint how to make this work would be appreciated.p

This is done byp  precodetemplate PerCMDNode,foobarsystemHOSTNAMEmessages.log .infomail.noneauthpriv.nonecron.none                PerCMDNode codepre  pAll is working fine untill i stop the cluster service and shared mount point become unavailable for rsyslog. In such situation rsyslog exits upon signal 15 and stops logging not only to that shared log file which is pretty obvious but to all log files.p  pMy question is if I could make rsyslog ignore missing log file and carry on logging when the file comes back onlinep

Negative 1478 pI have a 2x27 gridview thats holding white imageviews.  I then apply a colorfilter to the imageviews, and every cycle invalidate them.  The end result is some animated colors moving around the gridview.p  pIm having problems with the gridview randomly showing a white square, instead of the black I initalize everything to.  Then, as the colors change every imageview updates, except for the ones that failed to load properly the first time.  They always remain white.  p  pSometimes this doesnt happen. Sometimes its 1 square, sometimes its 4 squares. p  pIf I rotate my screen, the stuck white ones go away and everything works.

Negative 1478 pWhat is the right way to do escaping p  pI have a basic registration form, username and password eg. I save these value to database via php script everything is in php using PDO so no SQL injection should be possible i hope, if theres a safer way to do it, tell me please. My question is, should I escape username value before saving it into database. So if someone would try to dop  precodeltscriptgtalerthiltscriptgt codepre  pit would save something like this p  precodeampltscriptampgtalertampquothiampquotampltscriptampgt codepre  pin to the database. and after that no XSS should be possible yeah kinda naive statement but I dont know how else to say this. Or save the plain textp  precodeltscriptgtalerthiltscriptgt codepre  pinto database and at the time I want to print those values somewhere escape themp  pIn my opinion the safer way is to just escape on the save into database event, so put escaped values into database and then print them. But there is I guess my problem, should I again use escape function on those escaped values in database whenever I want to print them Or just print them as they are should be escaped. The first solution i dont like because the p  precodeltscriptgtalerthiltscriptgt codepre  pwill be rendered in browser as escaped but not as  just with safe chars like codeampltcode And the second solution seems that if I mess up once Im doomed.p

I am using containerfluid width so my Headers width is 100 however the ask is that out of three elements inside header one should stay to left and rest of the two should match left and right respectively of the below container.p  pSo far I have tried various layouts but below is the only one which is close to what I am looking for.p  precode    ltheader classcontainerfluid navbarfixedtopgt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolxs12 stylebackgroundcoloralicebluegt                                     ltdiv classcontainergt                     ltdiv classrowgt                         ltdiv classcolxs6 stylebackgroundcolorvioletgt2ltdivgt                         ltdiv classcolxs6 pullright stylebackgroundcolor lightbluegt3ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltspan stylepositionabsolutetop0left0gt                     A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.                 ltspangt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltheadergt codepre  pHowever challenge with this layout is that since the span is using absolute position when the browser is resized the text overlaps the second element inside header. I have already tried providing explicit width to it but it didnt help.p  pIf I dont use absolute position then the span and rest of the items are rendered in two different lines.p  pI am looking for advice on how to setup this header. p  pPS I have added random background colors to div tag to understand where they are getting rendered. Feel free to ignore them. p

Negative 1478 pIm trying to update our search process so it works a little better until our site gets a complete revamp in the next 67 months. Currently, its set up so it looks at the tables with the items name, number, color, and description. p  pFor whatever reason, it didnt work very well that way and it was leaving out a lot of results that should have and made sense to have been included. So, to remedy this, I added 2 new tables proitemkeyword and proitemkeywordlookup. p  pThe keyword table has a Keyword and KeywordID. The look up table has an ID and a KeywordID. I followed the same setup as the other selects and joins in the file that had been working decently well, just not retrieving all of the results when adding the keyword tables. p  pAs soon as I added the lines for the keyword tables and did a search, it told me the number of items that fit what I was searching for, but didnt actually display any of them. I had based it off of the lines dealing with the color mostly, since the color isnt actually displayed on the results page and the keyword wouldnt be either. I know that the MySQL tables are connecting to the keywords tables because of the additional number of results, and I can look at the prosearchlog table and see what I had searched for and the total results. p  pI dont understand why it works fine until I add additional tables into the mix.

Negative 1478 pI am trying to write an algorithm for an AI bot to search a 2D rectangular grid for a stationary object to destroy. The bot is constrained by a set number of moves that will not allow it to reach every corner of the space. The bot is only able to sense walls and objects in the squares directly adjacent to it NSEW, though not diagonally. The size of the space is constant and known, but the starting point of the bot and object is unknown. I want to search the room in the most effective manner to increase the likelihood of finding the object over a number of tests.p  pSo far I figure if the bot moves in a straight line until it hits the nearest wall takes a step back and turns left and continues until it hits another wall. From there the bot should be able to take a step back and turn left again. Then follow the wall along and move back through the remainder of the room in a zigzag fashion. Let me know if that description of movement need clarification.p  pIs there a more efficient way of moving through this space to find the objectp

Negative 1478 pShort question I do NOT want to use bcrypt random generated salts. Lets say the password I am hashing is abcd1234. In the good old days, the salt would be ab or abcd or abcd12, in other words, the salt would be the first N characters of the password where N is the required minimum length of a password. So how do I generate a valid bcrypt salt from the password itselfp  pLong question I am working with a messaging system, in other words, a message will be sent out internally for authentication and I cannot include the plaintext password in this message for obvious reasons. So the flow should be something like thatp  ul liMachine A gets the password in cleartextli liMachine A hashes the password with bcryptli liThe hashed i.e. safe password is sent in my internal messageli liMachine B, which is the authentication machine with the database of hashed passwords, get the message and now it has to compare the hashed password it received with the hashed password in the database for authentication.li ul  pBut how can I do that if BCrypt does NOT allow me to use a salt derived from my plaintext password Machine A knows nothing about any salt. It does not have any access to the database. Machine B is the one who will know that. So there must be a way to derive my bcrypt salt from abcd1234 or bcrypt should have a methodp  precodecheckString hashedPasswordWithSaltA, String hashedPasswordWithSaltB codepre  pPutting it down in straightforward terms Machine A gets the password and Machine B is the one that has the authentication database. I dont want to have to pass the password in clear text from A to B, but it looks like bcrypt forces me to do that. p

I understand the limitations, so if it is not possible, a workaround will do.p  pI have to create objects that handle different event types, I usually follow the strategy pattern, and with Ninject in C I can use multiinjection to inject an array of strategies in the constructor of my strategy broker. p  pThe idea is that I would like to create more handlers strategies and add them to the AngularJS DI system, without alter common code. I have done this in JS before, by having an object where I can append the new strategies, but I wonder which is the right way of doing it in Angular.p  pWould be possible somehow in Angular to do something similarp

But that way, foundation wont be the one applying that padding automatically. But if I disable this property, then foundation will take care of the padding. Is that possible With CSS onlyp

Negative 1478 pTLDR Is there a better way to notify clients that something unexpected happened on the server without throwing exceptions defined in the IDL.p  pJust for clarification I currently use Thrift with C on the server side THttpServer, TThreadPooledServer and a JavaScript AngularJS App on the client and i have some Tests running the Client foo on C.p  pSo... I know there is exception handling in Apache Thrift. I can define one in the IDL and tell a service method that theres a possibility of that exception happening. And when that happens the client gets notified that this exception happened and can act accordingly. p  pBut if because of one reason or another the code that gets executed in the handler just goes ahead and dies and throws an exception, the client just gets a Cannot read, Remote side has closed error and thats that. I cant really see what happened there and I have to start debugging the server without any clue what to look at. Of course I can log that exception on the server side which I intend to do but that can get messy and take a while to look at too.p  pWhat i actually want is to let the client at least know stuff happened on the server side and not just have it get a Yeah. Connection just got closed. No clue why it happened. Happy evening. p  pOne way to get this would be to make a GeneralExceptions.thrift file and define a general exception in there. Then include this file in every other .thrift file and have every service method expect that exception as one that can happen. And then make huge try catch blocks around my thrift handler methods to catch everything and their mother and wrap it in a neat general thrift exception package and have that go off to the client. p  pProblem is... having to have those try catch blocks everywhere would be annoying. And having to include one thrift file in all those other files and have every service method declare that it can throw this general exception... well lets just say... its a ton of work and with people being the way people usually are they could just forget to include the file or not add the exception in those service methods and all the other nice things that tend to happen if you got more then one guy or gal working on any given thing. p  pSo does anyone know another way to notify the client that stuff happened on the server without jumping through a ton of hoops p

Negative 1478 pI am somewhat new to the smart pointer world of C 11. I have been doing memory management manually and decided to dive into smart pointers. However, there is somewhat of a confusion though when it comes to codemanagerscodep  pI define a manager asp  blockquote   pAn object that owns and manages a set of objects. The objects are exclusively owned by the manager and its the managers responsibly to control their life cycle ie. delete them. It dispenses the objects for use in other parts of the program, but does not give away ownership.p blockquote  pIn other words, it lets other parts of the program borrow the resources it manages.p  pWhat I am a little bit confused about, is how to ensure ownership is preserved by the managerp  pFor instance, in a videogame, a Sprite might request a Texture from a texture manager. The sprite doesnt own the texture, it simply wants to use it. One way to do this, is to utilize a list of codeuniqueptrcodes. So I havep  precode    stdlistltstduniqueptrltSpriteTexturegtgt spriteTextureList codepre  pThis however doesnt work, because I cannot establish a codeweakptrcode to a codeuniqueptrcode. On the other hand, I can create a list of sharedpointersp  precode   stdlistltstdsharedptrltSpriteTexturegtgt spriteTextureList codepre  pThis will allow me to dispense codeweakptrcode to other parts of the program. However, the issue is that a sharedpointer can be duplicated, breaking ownership apart to multiple pointers. This of course can be controlled if I never pass back a shared pointer, but doing this seems to be counterintuitive for what a codesharedptrcode is meant to represent.p  pThe third alternative would be to simply dispense codesharedptrcode. However, this is not useful because then the manager doesnt technically own the objects. If the manager removes a codeTexturecode out of its list and something else has a codesharedptrcode to the codeTexturecode, then the texture wont be deleted. p  pIn the ideal situation this should be just fine, because there should be no existing pointers to the codeTexturecode before the manager deletes it, but I can see this becoming a debugging hassle.p  pI definitely have a weak understanding of smart pointers. Maybe I am miss understanding how smart pointers are supposed to be implementedp  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 1478 pI have created a simple Activity. The activity is responsible for downloading data from parse.com database and populating a linear layout. In the process, I am dynamically creating the linear layout with TextViews and ImageViews according according to the content. p  pThe problem is that, whenever I try to download an image, I use as AsyncTask Downloading class, which results in slowing down the UI thread I am currently trying to return the bitmap file from the AsyncTask Image downloading class using codereturnedBitmap  new LoadImage.executesrc.getcode which might be responsible for slowing down the UI thread.

Negative 1478 pSo I need to extract and possibly in future import font file images in order to visualize them which have the following format illustrativep  precodestruct      DWORD dwNLines how many lines is the image long     DWORD dwNBytesPerLine how many pixels represented as bytes each line have      BYTE [ dwNLines  dwNBytesPerLine ] Aplha Image as each byte represents how much transparent is the pixel at the line it belongs to   codepre  pAny ideas how can I do this I have VC 2013 and latest WinSDKs and Im targeting Windows Platform.p
Negative 1478 pI have made a bundle which has an Activator file that basically launches other bundles by their correct order. I needed this because the framework would start some bundles before their dependencies have finished starting. For example my bundles depending on my log service would start before it, so log messages would not be stored for those bundles.

I thought it was 11111100b but this makes the color red on grey and the characters blink on and off. Probably something very simple but I cant figure it out.

Negative 1478 pI have a messaging system using Azure ServiceBus but Im using Nimbus on top of that. I have an endpoint that sends a command to another endpoint and at one point the handler class on the other side picks it up, so it is all working fine.p  pWhen the operation takes time, roughly more than 20 second or so, the handler gets another call with the same message. It looks like Nimbus is retrying the message that is already being handled by an other even the same instance of the handler, I dont see any exceptions being thrown and I could easily repro this with the following handlerp  precodepublic class Synchronizer  IHandleCommandltRequestSynchronizationgt      public async Task HandleRequestSynchronization synchronizeInfo              Console.WriteLineReceived Synchronization          await Task.DelayTimeSpan.FromSeconds30 Simulate long running process          Console.WriteLineGot through first timeout          await Task.DelayTimeSpan.FromSeconds30 Simulate another long running process          Console.WriteLineGot through second timeout       codepre  pMy question is How do I disable this behavior I am happy for the transaction take time as it is a heavy process that I have offloaded from my website, which was the whole point of going with this architecture in the first place. p  pIn other words, I was expecting the message to not to be picked up by another handler while one has picked it up and is processing it, unless theres an exception and the message goes back to the queue and eventually gets picked up for a retry.p  pAny ideas how to do this Anything Im missingp

Negative 1478 pWe are using Adaptive Delayed Chained Payment method to transfer funds from one party to another party with ourselves as an intermediary merchant that takes a percentage. In this scenario we are the primary receiver and there is a secondary receiver as well. In case of a partial refund to the party sending the money the client we need to transfer the balance fee less our commission to the secondary receiver.p  pIt seems that we cannot call the Execute function after the partial refund process to complete the transaction flow. i.e. once the the client is partially refunded, we as the intermediary and primary receiver hold the balance funds. The secondary receiver does not get paid since we cannot call the Execute function. So the balance fee is stuck at the primary receiver end. So how can we send the balance fee to the secondary receiver in this partial refunding process Any help would be highly appreciated.p  pTwo of us have searched this site and other sites, but cannot find anywhere that addresses this issue.p  pThanksp

Negative 1478 pI am using Elaticsearch v1.4.2 along with NEST .NET client v1.3.1. On the same server and Elasticsearch instance I have 2 indexes assume IndexEnvironmentA, IndexEnvironmentB. Each of these two indexes holds documents of the same type TypeA but they refer to different environments e.g UATDEV. I want to create aliases on these indexes with Routing and Filtering based on a field of Type A lets say GroupId. p  pIn my code I have the following snipet that creates the alias in each index.p  precodepublic void CreateAliasstring aliasName              client.Aliasa gt a.Add                 ad gt ad.IndexindexName                     .AliasaliasName                     .FilterltTypeAgtf gt f.Termt gt t.GroupId, aliasName                     .RoutingaliasName          codepre  pAfter creating the alias I index some data in both indexes using the following code.p  precodepublic void IndexDocumentTypeA t              client.Indext, ind gt ind                 .IndexindexName                 .Routingt.GroupId                 .Typetypeof TypeA                 .Idt.Id          codepre  pWhen testing the data indexed using Sense and a matchall query I notice the following When I perform the query against the a hrefhttpElasticServerIPIndexEnvironmentATypeA relnofollowhttpElasticServerIPIndexEnvironmentATypeAa results are returned as I would expect.

Elasticsearch cannot know which of the two indexes actually aliases I am referring to. If this is the expected behavior does this mean that the aliases are actually of no use in this case and I lose their or some of their benefits Do I have to include the routing value and filter values in all the requests that I send to this Elasticsearch instance p  pId appreciate any thoughts on this issue.

I have also tried doing what the answer suggests from this questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq155711643187637Call a public method of main class from another classap  pBut that comes up with an error as I cant overload the btnSubmitClick method as the Designer freaked out. So I created a new method that had all of the code of btnSubmitClick called codepublic static void addingTaskListDisplaycode but I then had to create an instance of ListDisplay in order to put it as an argument in the btnSubmitClick method hence ending up with two instances which is not what I want due to answer of question.p  pSo now I have come up with nothing and would appreciate any help you could give in order to call this LoadingListBox method.

Negative 1478 pI am new to the world of Python, and I have searched numerous places for a way to overcome a problem Im having.p  pFirst, some context so as to be as clear as possible.  I have created a decentsized dictionary of CAN data messages.  The CAN message IDs serve as keys, while each message is paired in a list with its corresponding timestamp.  The result is a dictionary with a format like the one below but much largerp  precoded  1011C0BB [[30.1429, 0FFF0000]],     00132058 [[30.1942, 00], [30.2512, 00], [40.5021, 00]] codepre  p...and so on.  The gist being that the dictionary has a bunch of keys, all of which have lists of lists of data, with those lists being of variable length.p  pI am trying to visualize how the bits are changing over time so that I can attempt to reverse engineer their meaning or at least their groupings.  I have achieved bitwise pointbypoint plotting of the data with the following codep  precodecolors  listproductnp.arange0.00,1.00,0.20,repeat3 rgb  0  for i in range0,lenrawdatadct.keys     plt.holdTrue     plt.figurei     plt.titlerawdatadct.keys[i]     for j in range0,lenrawdatadct.values[i]         timedata  []         timedata.appendrawdatadct.values[i][j][0]         for k in range0,lenrawdatadct.values[i][j][1]             bitdata  []             bitdata.appendintrawdatadct.values[i][j][1][k],16             for m in range0,lenbitdata                 plt.plottimedata, bitdata[m], markero,                          color[colors[rgb][0],colors[rgb][1],colors[rgb][2]],                         labelrawdatadct.keys[i]             del bitdata         del timedata     rgb  1 codepre  pIts probably not the cleanest or most Pythonic way of doing that, but it works and it colorcodes the data in correspondence with the CAN ID the original intent was to produce one graph with all of the data, but thats not an effective way of looking at itp  pMy main issue is that it produces a huge amount of graphs or one graph with a huge amount of colorful data on it with some slight alterations.

Negative 1478 pThe most programming I do is shell scripts or some python or perl, so I have a basic understanding after Googling for a bit. A little background on what im doing. We have two inventory systems Ours and Theirs. I need to pull information from Theirs to compare with Ours. p  pThe problem We need UPCs to do inventory while They provide SKUs in their monthly inventory report.p  pThe solution Join 3 tables. Im using phpmyadmin to manage a mysql backend on a recent install of Debain Wheezy.p  pThe first query takes every SKU They have in Their inventory, compares it with the UPC in Their listings and, since not every UPC is actually a UPC, compares it to the UPC in Our listings. It looks like thisp  precodeSELECT TheirListings.upc,  SUMTheirInventory.quantity FROM TheirInventory JOIN TheirListings ON TheirListings.sku   TheirInventory.sku JOIN OurListings ON TheirListings.upc  OurListings.Upc GROUP BY TheirListings.upc ORDER BY TheirListings.upc codepre  pAnd it seems to work well. Our system is happy with it and it makes me happy because this reduces manual entry by 96. Now I need to get everything this didnt catch the 4 that does need manual entry. Our tables shortened for brevity like thisp  precodeTheirListings       TheirInventory      OurListings upc                 sku                 upc sku                 quantity         codepre  pI need to select all the SKUs and associated quantitiesp  precodeSELECT TheirInventory.sku,  SUMTheirInventory.quantity FROM  TheirInventory LEFT OUTER JOIN TheirListings ON TheirListings.sku   TheirInventory.sku LEFT OUTER JOIN OurListings ON TheirListings.upc  OurListings.upc WHERE OurListings.upc IS NULL OR TheirListings.upc IS NULL GROUP BY TheirInventory.sku ORDER BY TheirInventory.sku codepre  pTo double check its catching the remainder, I did SELECT COUNTTheirInventory.sku for both of those queries and another to return the total of skus. Adding my two queries gives me exactly 1 more than expected. Im not sure where I went wrong.p

Negative 1478 pSay I have a dict at hand at runtime, is there an easy way to create code that defines the dict. For example it should output the stringp  precoded  stringattr1  value1, boolattr1 True codepre  pOf course it would be possible to write a converter function by hand, which iterates over the keyvalue pairs and puts together the string. Would still require to handle special cases to decide if values have to be quoted or not, etc.p  pMore generally Is there a built in way or a library to generate variable declarations from runtime data structuresp  pContext I would like to use a list of dicts as input for a code generator. The content of the dicts would be queried from an SQL database. I dont want to tightly couple code generation to the querying of the SQL database, so I think it would be convenient to go with generating a python source file defining a list of dictionaries, which can be used as an input to the code generator.p

Meaning nothing crashes and the music plays properly start to end.p  pThe music class is from my understanding much too big.

Maybe my knowledge is not sufficient or maybe I missed something crucial.p  pTo get to the point Where does that access violation come from and how can I prevent itp  pEDIT Changed the example code so it is straightforward for anyone to reproduce it.

Negative 1478 pI have a working selfhosted OWIN based 2.2 WebApi project.  I wanted to put authorization into it and share the identity service with my MVC 5 website.  There a numerous opinions on if or how easy doing so may be.  My attempt to share the authorizationauthentication cookie has lead me into a hole.  I discovered that the WebApi code was not seeingprocessing the cookie even though it was in the request header.  I then decided to try a test in which I would generate the cookie in the WebApi on one call and accept it on another.  That attempt lead me to the fact that CreatePerOwinContext is not working as I thought it should.p  pI placed the following code in a method to generate the cookie.p  precodevar ctx  Request.GetOwinContext var asim  ctx.GetltApplicationSignInManagergt asim.SignInAsyncuser, false, false codepre  pand discovered that the Get was returning null.  I then investigated the code in my startupp  precodeappBuilder.CreatePerOwinContextltApplicationSignInManagergtApplicationSignInManager.Create codepre  pI placed a breakpoint on ApplicationSigInManger.Create and never reached it.  I placed a breakpoint at the same location in my MVC 5 code and did hit the breakpoint.  Yes, I did verify that I am reaching and continuing past the call to  CreatePerOwinContext.  The lack of hitting the breakpoint has lead me to conclude that the call to CreatePerOwinContext is not working the same in WebApi as in MVC 5.p  pBoth the MVC project and the WebApi project are using .Net 4.6 release code and the latest versions of their respective NuGet packages.p

Negative 1478 pI am using a very bubblegumandducttape solution for handling an online leaderboard for a small arcadestyle game in Unity WebGL. Currently, the game client sends an HTTP GET request with two parameters codenameNAMEampscore111111code . While the URL will not be normally presented to the average player, obviously it is very easy to find and exploit via browser developer tools.p  pMy solution was to somehow encrypt the score string with a key exclusive to the game client and server, and if the submitted string did not decrypt successfully, the server would reject the score.p  pHowever, I have absolutely zero understanding of cryptography, and my many attempts to google for solutions and adapting code from many results have all been futile. I have no idea which algorithm to use, whether my keys are actually usable, and why each thing isnt working. I have no idea how else to easily prevent this leaderboard from having false scores submitted, and this is the most viable solution I could think of.p  pHow would I be able to decrypt a short string on the Unity end, pass it through the URL, and then decrypt it from the node.js end, and execute specific code based on whether it successfully decrypted or notp
Negative 1478 pI am using bokehserver 0.9.3 to create a dashboard with plots that let users zoompan.  I want to programmatically see where they are zoompanned to, so that I can do downstream processing of only that portion of the plot.  How can I programmatically access the zoompan valuesp  pIve tried doing it through the xrange property, but it is pretty opaque.  Specifically, its start and end values have been None in every permutation Ive tried.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 1478 pI have a game where the main character shoots bullets at enemies currently bombs by pressing an onscreen button and tries to avoid falling objects. Currently I have no problem when shooting one or even a few bullets at a time. However, when testing, if I shoot a bunch at a time between 20 and 50 I receive the above error. Does anyone have any suggestions Im not sure why any of my nodes would be nil. I suspect that my bullets are not actually being removed when they exit the screen but perhaps that is a different problem in itself. p  pHere is the line that is getting the error  p  precodefunc

When the user clicks the projection the courtains will open starting a song, also there will be text information, images, etc.p  pits finished, but i like to make something about closing the tab.p  pi want this when the user press the x to close the tab, make a delay, for example, 3 seconds, on that 3 sec, the courtains will close, so to the end of animation i know how to make the animation the tab close. Something like thats all folks, but only 3 or 2 secs.p  pive searched alot, but only find how to make a textbox asking if you want to close the tab, tried to modify the code to make the animation, but nothing happends just close the current tab.p

Negative 1478 pAfter spending more than few days on debugging, I cant find the reason why my code below creates additional spaces when printing out the error check expecting or missing. For example, when I run each of these line of symbols one at a time in order.p  pThe first two works fine, but the third line of input will error check at the wrong position. But the symbol that its expecting is correct lt. When I remove the call to the reset function in the bottom of my code, the error check of the third line of input will be at the correct position but the symbol that its expecting is incorrect  . Most likely because the stack hasnt reseted from the previous line of inputs. p  pI made print statements on the values of the increments for printing spaces and the size of the char array itself, but the numbers are correct. The culprit might be the reset function I made, but the character resets fine. Only problem is that the output is creating additional spaces when printing out the error check, which leads to displaying the error check at the wrong position.p

Negative 1478 pI have a problem with message encryption. In two words, we have SOAP service with authorization token, asymmetric signature and encryption. Also, we need to extend our service for another nonsoap protocol, and for some security reasons I need to encrypt my message body using soap encryption algorithm. And I cant understand, what kind of encryption algo used in soap. As I can see there  a hrefhttpcxf.apache.orgdocswssecurity.html relnofollowhttpcxf.apache.orgdocswssecurity.htmla, I need to use my X.509 public key on client to encrypt message. But i cant understand, what kind of algo I need to use for message encryption. I think it must be DES but I cant understand how encrypt message with des using public key. I know how to encrypt it with RSA, but RSA does not work with large messages.p  pGenerally, I cant understand, how I can get secret key from certificate.p
