Positive 8109 pI have created a bucket in Amazon S3 and have uploaded 2 files in it and made them public. I have the links through which I can access them from anywhere on the Internet. I now want to put some restriction on who can download the files. Can someone please help me with that. I did try the documentation, but got confused. p  pI want that at the time of download using the public link it should ask for some credentials or something to authenticate the user at that time. Is this possiblep

Positive 8109 pi am trying to make a robust application that can download  blob files from a mysql server. The files are executables or other binary files. The download itself works well, but i want to bullet proof it to survive an internet cutoff midway in a download. If the internet cutoff occurs before the preparedstatement.execute,everything goes well, the memory is cleared of garbage and the program exits gracefully . On the other hand ,if i cutoff the internet 5 seconds into the execution of the preparedstatement.execute,the thread that is downloading hangs indefinitely and is never cleared by the Garbage collector and the program never exits. The main exits,the downloader manager exits,but the downloading thread never exits.

Positive 8109 pI am using the Store Kit SKPaymentQueue to download 100 megabyte file to my app.  For some reason that I cannot seem to understand the download is interrupted when either applicationWillEnterForeground or applicationDidBecomeActive cant tell which, but there is nothing in those AppDelegates.

I have tried calling it from the App Delegate as its own singleton class also, but the same problem seems to persist.  Downloads complete if the view does not change.  Downloads also silently complete if the user presses the home button and minimizes the app.  However that download will be interrupted if the user returns to the app before the download is completed.

Positive 8109 pMy App downloads multiple files at the same time. My scenario is as followsp  ol liThe user clicks a download button.li liA Download UITableViewCell is initialized that implements NSURLSessionDelegate to download the specify file.li liA download is started. The Download Cell shows progress as the file is being downloaded using the provided Delegates by NSURLSession.li liThe file is saved locally in the documents folder.li liThe user clicks a button the clears all the finished downloads. This button clears the array downloadQueue that Download Cell uses. The button also calls tableView.reloadData to update the tableViewli ol  pThe problem is, when the user initiates multiple downloads, no problem occurs. All files download properly simultaneously. However when the user clicks the button described in step 5, and then tries to download another file, the download progress shows 100 completed immediately. And no file is saved locally. This is probably due to didFinishDownloadingToURL being called immediately.p  pHere is the complete code of my DownloadCell.swiftp  precodeclass DownloadCell UITableViewCell, NSURLSessionDelegate    IBOutlet weak var lblSongName UILabel IBOutlet weak var progressBar UIProgressView IBOutlet weak var progressCount UILabel  var song Song  var task NSURLSessionTask  var percentageWritten Float  0.0 var taskTotalBytesWritten  0 var taskTotalBytesExpectedToWrite  0  lazy var session NSURLSession       let config  NSURLSessionConfiguration.ephemeralSessionConfiguration     config.allowsCellularAccess  false     let session  NSURLSessionconfiguration config, delegate self, delegateQueue NSOperationQueue.mainQueue     return session        override func awakeFromNib      super.awakeFromNib      Initialization code        func startDownload       lblSongName.text  song.songName      if self.task  nil          return          let url  NSURLstring song.songDownloadLink     let req  NSMutableURLRequestURL url     let task  self.session.downloadTaskWithRequestreq     self.task  task     task.resume    func URLSessionsession NSURLSession, downloadTask NSURLSessionDownloadTask, didWriteData bytesWritten Int64, totalBytesWritten writ Int64, totalBytesExpectedToWrite exp Int64      taskTotalBytesWritten  Intwrit     taskTotalBytesExpectedToWrite  Intexp     percentageWritten  FloattaskTotalBytesWritten  FloattaskTotalBytesExpectedToWrite     progressBar.progress  percentageWritten     progressCount.text  StringIntpercentageWritten100        printtaskTotalBytesWritten  taskTotalBytesExpectedToWrite   func URLSessionsession NSURLSession, task NSURLSessionTask, didCompleteWithError error NSError      if error  nil          printCompleted with error error        func URLSessionsession NSURLSession, downloadTask NSURLSessionDownloadTask, didFinishDownloadingToURL location NSURL       do      let documentsDirectoryURL   NSFileManager.URLsForDirectory.DocumentDirectory, inDomains .UserDomainMask.first as NSURL     progressCount.text  Done     progressBar.progress  100.0      try NSFileManager.moveItemAtURLlocation, toURL documentsDirectoryURL.URLByAppendingPathComponentsong.songName  .mp3          Handling Badge Values         let tabBar  UIApplication.sharedApplication.keyWindow.rootViewController as UITabBarController         let downloadVC  tabBar.viewControllers[1] as DownloadViewController         let badgeValue  IntdownloadVC.tabBarItem.badgeValue  1         downloadVC.tabBarItem.badgeValue  StringbadgeValue          if badgeValue  0              downloadVC.tabBarItem.badgeValue  nil                catch          printError occurred during saving.         progressCount.text  Stringerror         codepre  pp

Negative 8109 pRecently I had to fix a bug that was reported from the field. While the test team was trying to reproduce the issue, the customer was breathing down our neck and we had to have  production ready code in just a weeks time. When at last when we were able to reproduce the issue there was just 3 days left. I and my colleague had to put in almost 30 hours of nonstop effort in finding the cause and having the fix in place in the code that wasnt written by us. Luckily we did it. However, my concern is that the test team didnt have enough of time to run through their usual test cases. And we had to overlook other trivial mistakes in the code to limit the code changes. p  pI would like to know from the community the best practices to follow in such timecritical conditions. Is it okay to neglect other issues which arent causes for the bug you are working on How to limit the code changes, that too in legacy code, as much as possible such that I need not worry that only minimal testing is possible. Continuous work without any sufficient breaks can also add its problems. Please share your thoughts and experience.p

Negative 8109 pThis is the  situation  I mostly program C and have written types in it I dont want to lose.  At the same time I would like to learn functional programming.  The obvious answer of course is F.  p  pBut for everything apart from C I use emacs as an editor, and I really would like to learn Lisp too. Learn your editorsIDEs language you know, thats why I know a bit VB to write my VSmacros in it And its not just emacs, Lisp is something I really want to learn.  p  pAs for F, I could mingle it with C without any interop problem, have a great GUI WPF and a lot of other .NET goodies. But it is, of course, not as mature as Lisp.p  pIf I am realistic I know if I want to smuggle a functional language into my professional life it has to be F.  Since learning two whole languages seems a bit much, I was hoping that Lisp would be a great way to learn functional programming, and if I start out F later, It would be very easy....p  pIs this true  Or are the two languages not comparable at allp

Negative 8109 pIm developing a 64bit inproc VC ATL COM server that basically just redirects all calls to an outproc COM server. So my COM server basically does nothing.p  pInitially it used the C runtime in a DLL codeMDcode compiler switch. Ive noticed that when I deploy it on a clean 64bit Win2k3 regsvr32 fails with an error emLoadLibraryfileName failed  This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.emp  pGoogle helps  the problem is that VC9 runtime is not installed. The problem persists even when msvcr90.dll is in the same directory as my COM server. That as I guess is because of how search for dependent libraries works  it doent look into the same directory and I need the msvcr90.dll in WindowsSystem32 or the like. Since this is a complication to my deployment I switched to using the statically linked C runtime MT compiler switch. Now it deploys fine. The size of the .dll file is 110k only was 45k so it doesnt bother me.p  pNow Ive heard a lot about how bad it is to mix different versions of C runtime in one process  CRT state can be broken, hell can break loose and so on. Do I have to think of this and expect problems from changing MD to MT especially since I dont know what version the COM server consumers are using p

Negative 8109 pHi I have following JavaScript code that I am trying to run. My aim is to grasp the meaning of codethiscode in different scopes and different types of invocations in JavaScript. p  pIf you look in code below I have a inner anonymous function, which is getting assigned to codeinnerStuffcode variable. In that anonymous function as such codethiscode points to codewindowcode object and not the outer function object or anything else. Event though it still has access to out functions variables.p  pAnyway, I am not sure, why that would be but if you look at code below, I pass codethiscode in form of codethatcode to codeinnerStuffcode later and it works just fine and prints object with codedoofuscode attribute in console. p  precode    var someStuff           doofuswhatever,         newF function                      var that  this             console.logthat             var innerStuff  functiontopThis                 console.logtopThis                           return innerStuffthat                    someStuff.newF codepre  pNow I am changing a code only little bit. And instead of assigning it to codeinnerStuffcode, Ill just directly return the function by invoking it as shown belowp  precode    var someStuff           doofuswhatever,         newF function                      var that  this             console.logthat             return functionthat                 console.logthat                                 someStuff.newF codepre  pThis prints undefined for the inner anonymous function. Is it because there is a clash between a codethatcode that is being passed as parameter and a codethatcode defined in outside function  I thought the parameter would have overriden the visibility. Why would the value be not retained p  pThis is utterly confusing. p  pOn the other hand if I dont pass codethatcode, but instead just use it, because visibility is there, the outcome is proper and as expected. p  pWhat is it that I am missing Is it the clash between the variables, present in same scope Is there a good reason, that inner functions have codethiscode bound to codewindowcode objectp

Negative 8109 pI am implementing a UISlider a user can manipulate to set a distance. I have never used the CocoaTouch UISlider, but have used other frameworks sliders, usually there is a variable for setting the step and other helper properties.p  pThe documentation for the UISlider deals only with a max and min value, and the output is always a 6 decimal float with a linear relation to the position of the slider nob. I guess I will have to implement the desired functionality step by step.p  pTo the user, the minmax values range from 10 m to 999 Km, I am trying to implement this in an exponential way, that will feel natural to the user. I.e. the user experiences a feeling of control over the values, big or small. Also that the output has reasonable values. Values like 10m 200m 2.5km 150 km etc. instead of 1.2342356 m or 108.93837756 km.p  pI would like for the step size to increase by 10m for the first 200m, then maybe by 50m up to 500m, then when passing the 1000 m value, it starts to deal with Kilometers, so then it is step size  1 km up until 50 km, then maybe 25 km steps etc.p  pAny way I go about this I end up doing a lot of rounding and a lot of calculations wrapped in  a forrest of if statements and NSStringNumber conversions, each time the user moves the slider just a little.p  pI was hoping someone could lend me a bit of inspirationmath help or make me aware of  a more lean approach to solving this problem.p  pMy last idea is to populate and array with a 100 string values, then have the slider int value correspond to a string, this is not very flexible, but doable.p  pThank you in advance for any help givenp

Negative 8109 pWe are just starting out with NHibernate and have been looking at the NH Cookbook 3.0 which highlights using an EventListener for stamping an object with who created an object and when, then who changed an object and when.  We are now looking at implementing an audit tracker event listener creating a history of property value changes.   Is it considered best practise to have two or more event listeners each handling one task, or a single eventlistener handling multiple tasks.p  pSo the single event listener code would look something likep  precodepublic class EventListener  IPreInsertEventListener, IPreUpdateEventListener      ...     ...     public bool OnPreUpdatePreUpdateEvent e              stamper.Updatee.Entity as IStampedEntity, e.OldState, e.State, e.Persister         auditTracker.Updatee.Entity as IAuditTrackedEntity, e.OldState, e.State, e.Persister         return false       codepre  pWhilst the two event listener model would be something likep  precodepublic class StamperEventListener  IPreInsertEventListener, IPreUpdateEventListener      ...     ...     public bool OnPreUpdatePreUpdateEvent e              stamper.Updatee.Entity as IStampedEntity, e.OldState, e.State, e.Persister         return false        public class AuditHistoryEventListener  IPreUpdateEventListener      ...     ...     public bool OnPreUpdatePreUpdateEvent e              auditTracker.Updatee.Entity as IAuditTrackedEntity, e.OldState, e.State, e.Persister         return false       codepre  pWhich is considered best practise and are there any performance drawbacks to either  The later two separate event listeners would seem like the best implementation for both clarify and maintenance, but just unsure if its going to cause us problems later on.p

Negative 8109 pThis is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5596129glibgatomicintgetbecomesnoopthis questiona.p  prmmhs claim on that question was that on certain architectures, no special magic is needed to implement atomic get and set.  Specifically, in this case that gatomicintgetampfoo from glib gets expanded simply to ampfoo.  I understand that this means that foo will not be in an internally consistent state.  However am I also guaranteed that foo wont be cached by a given CPU or corep  pSpecifically, if one thread is setting foo, and another reading it using the glib gatomic functions, can I assume that the reader will see the updates to the variable made by the writer. Or is it possible for the writer to simply update the value in a register  For reference my target platform is gcc 4.1.2 on a multicore multiCPU X8664 machine.p

Negative 8109 pIm playing around with the design of a Lift Simulation. I have a Lift Controller with a collection of Lifts. A Lift moves through particular states e.g. STATIONARY, MOVING, DOORSOPEN etc..  In the MOVING state, the Lift process will simply sleep for X ms. Im currently focusing on the interactions between the Lift Controller process and the collection of Lift processes.p  pEssentially, the Lift Controller needs to coordinate the Lifts and so needs to take floor requests and determine which Lift is best to service this request and then subsequently inform that Lift.p  pMy initial thoughts were to have each Lift, upon floor request receipt, move itself through the various states, and then inform the Lift Controller once its completed moving to a particular floor. However, with such a design, the Lift Controller may query the lift to see which floor its near, make a decision for that Lift i.e. stop at next floor, but by the time its told the Lift to stop, that Lift may have moved on past that floor delay due to say network blip.p  pTo avoid these types of issues where the Lift Controller makes decisions based on out of date information, Ive thought of making the Lift Controller responsible for moving each Lift through its states. With this model, the Lift Controller knows what state a Lift is in, tells it to make a transition, then knows what state it will be in after. As such, the Lift Controller always has upto date information as to what the Lifts are doing, and its actions will never be out of sync with the individual Lift states.p  pDo people have any concerns with this type of approach wrt. threading, scalability  are there better ways of modelling this Thoughts welcome p

They do have a column of similar data Postal Codes  Zip Codes. p  pWhat I have to do with these tables is compare the postal codes from one table compare them to the postal codes from the first table and count them. p  h3For Example.h3  pTable A has a postal code of T0A and T0B I use only the first three characters in the postal code as this is all I need to compare againstp  pTable B has 13 rows where the postal code matches T0A and 3 rows where the postal code matches T0B. p  pSo the outcome would look likep  precodeT0A  13 T0B  3 codepre  pHOWEVER, then I need to take these and separate them by city, so since both T0A and T0B could be one city I would need to take those and add them together and get something like. p  precodeEdmonton  16 codepre  pIve been doing this with for loops and arrays. So Im reading the data from table A into one array and the data from table b into another array. Then I compare the postal codes from table B to the postal codes in table A using nested for loops in order to count the number of occurrences of the postal codes and then I store them in another array. This is all fine and dandy however now Im a bit stuck trying to separate the counts into their correct cities and Im sitting here thinking there must be an easier way to do this.

Negative 8109 pWith C and C experience and some little Java knowledge Im now starting a JavaJNI C project Android, if that matters.p  pI have a native method, that creates some C class and returns a pointer to it as a Java long value say, handle. And then other native methods called from Java code here and there, use the handle as a parameter to do some native operations on this class. C side does not own the object, its Java side who does. But in the current architecture design its hard to define who exactly owns the object and when to delete it. So it would probably be nice to make Java VM garbage collector to manage the objects lifetime somehow. The C class does not consume any resources, except some piece of memory, not large. So its OK, if several such objects will not be destructed. p  pIn C I would probably wrap the native IntPtr handle in some managed wrapper class. And override its finalizer to call native objects destructor when the managed wrapper is garbage collected. SafeHandle, AddMemoryPressure, etc. might be also of help here.p  pThis is a different story with Javas finalize. The second thing you know after Hello world in Java, is that using finalize is bad. Are there any other ways to accomplish this in Java Maybe using PhantomReferencep

Negative 8109 pThere are a multitude of questions here relating to locking movie playback into landscape mode, or supporting landscape playback of movies using MPMoviePlayerViewController or MPMoviePlayerController. I already have landscapeportrait functionality, and I dont want to lock the playback to either mode.p  pWhat I have is code which uses MPMoviePlayerViewController as the docs suggest, essentiallyp  pre     MPMoviePlayerViewController movieViewController           [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURLurl]     [parentViewController presentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimatedmovieViewController] pre  pMy app is mostly locked to portrait mode, but this code presents the movie controller modally in its own view, and supports both portrait and landscape orientations. All of which is very nice.p  pHere is my problem though. 99 of the videos I will be presenting are landscape videos, and the above code starts the movie playback in portrait mode, because the user is likely holding the device in portrait mode.p  pWhat I want is the behaviour of the native YouTube app that when you present the movie controller, it first presents in landscape mode, which will prompt the user to change their devices orientation. If they later on want to rotate it back to portrait they are allowed to. When the movie is done or dismissed, the movie view controller will be dismissed, and the device should be in portrait mode.p  pIt seems impossible to hide the status bar properly its tied to the full screen controls regardless of the state of hideStatusBar before launching the movie, so it seems that getting the status bar to be in the right place also needs to be a part of this.p  pstrongEdited to add debugging notes for status bar orientationstrong If I call codesetStatusBarOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRightcode before launching the movie, the status bar is in the right place, but the system no longer calls codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcode in the same way.p  pIf I dont call codesetStatusBarOrientationcode, prior to the movie appearing I get the following sequence of callsp  preshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationPortrait shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationPortrait shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationPortrait shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationRight shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationPortraitpre  pI answer YES only to the Right, and the movie launches in LandscapeRight, but with the status bar in the wrong place. Subsequent changes of device orientation generate exactly the codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcode calls youd expect e.g. if I rotate to Portrait, it asks me if its okay to rotate to Portrait.p  pIf I do call codesetStatusBarOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRightcode, I get the following sequencep  preshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationRight shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationRightpre  pBoth of which I answer YES to. The status bar is in the right place, but I no longer get an calls to codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcode asking about Portrait mode. So if I rotate the device to Right, then back to Portrait, then back to Right, I see it call codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationRightcode twice. Even stranger, if I rotate it all the way around to the Left orientation, I do get codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationLeftcode strongand from then on everything works finestrong. Which is most annoying.p  pI think it must be a bug on the iOS side, and thats why the YouTube app doesnt use the animated UI rotation effects. Instead it hides the full screen controls, including the status bar, rotates invisibly in the background, and then reshows the controls.p

Negative 8109 pI am writing a compiler  just for fun and to improve my skills. Id like to implement a subset of C language. The problem is Im compiling to the assembler of theoretical 16bit RISC processor called Sextium II we used to teach assembler on it on our University.p  pThe processor uses only 16 commands, and none of them is a bit operation. I would like to implement C bit operators  and afterwards halfprecision floats  but I have no idea how to implement bit operations using only codeADDcode, codeSUBcode, codeMULcode and codeDIVcode instructions. Bitshift is quite easy, it is just multiplication or division by code2ncode, where codencode is the shift length. But what about codeANDcode, codeORcode, codeNOTcode or codeXORcodep  pstrongEDITstrong To be clear processor computes only in 16bit signed U2 arithmetics.p

Negative 8109 pI have a simple application, not documentbased. I want to have a login window that allows people to login or add a user, and when they logged in successfully I want it to load the main page. If from the main page you click log out, it should destroy the main page and take you back to login page. sounds like a simple plan, but for some reason I have a problem. p  pThe way I have it right now, I check if the customer logged in or not in the main file AppDelegate and load different window controller. When customer logs in, I send a notification back to AppDelegate from Login Conntroller and load another window controller for main window. p  pSomething like thisp  precodeif[[settings getisLoggedIn] isEqualToStringYes]       MainController tmpMainController  [[MainController alloc] initWithWindowNibNameMainWindow]     self.mainController  tmpMainController     NSWindow mainWindow  [tmpMainController window]     [mainWindow makeKeyAndOrderFrontself]     [tmpMainController release]    else      LoginController tmpViewController  [[LoginController alloc] initWithWindowNibNameLoginWindow]     self.loginController  tmpViewController     loginWindow  [tmpViewController window]     [loginWindow makeKeyAndOrderFrontself]     [tmpViewController release]  codepre  pEverything works fine, it displays the correct window. But the weird part happens when I log out from the main page, log in again and log out again. If I do it several times, instead of showing me 1 login window, it draws 2. If I continue the login process, on the second try I get 2 main windows. If I log out again, I see 4 cascade login windows, then I see 5 or 7 main windows. After all windows gets loaded all extra windows start getting destroyed onebyone.  It looks like when new window gets created it draws all old windows, then the new one and then destroys all old ones. I dont know why it happens. Would like some help. p  pHere is the code from my main controller when customer clicks log outp  precodeIBActionlogOutClickid sender       [settings setisLoggedIn valueNo]      [[self window] orderOutself]      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNameNSUserLoggedOutNotification object self userInfo nil]  codepre  pthe same thing for login controllerp  precodeif [users verifyUser]          [settings setisLoggedIn valueYes]         [loginView removeFromSuperview]         [[self window] orderOutself]         [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNameNSUserLoggedInNotification object self userInfo nil]      codepre  pI have Released when closed checked off for both windows. p

Negative 8109 pOk, so this question will probably get closed, but hell, its 430 in the morning and I cant sleep because Im still frustrated with my Java midterm last night.  The test was an online thing and you get to see how you did immediately.p  pThe test was poorly written with tons of typos and grammatical errors.  I dont normally care about that, except that when you add in vaguely phrased questions you arent sure how to interpret the question anymore, since you cant assume you can parse it according to the normal rules of English.p  pOne particular question that sticks in my crawp  pWhat is the base type for Collections  It was written like that, with the capital C, which I think is important.p  pThe only two relevant possibilities were Object and Collections.  Now I know that Collections is the class from which most of the collection classes derive, so I initially selected that.  On my second runthrough I thought, wait a minute. By base type, does he mean what is the base class from which Collections derives After all, by capitalizing the C it indicated Collections class in a specific sense, rather than just collections in a generic sense. So I changed my answer to Object, because I know that Collections extends Object.p  pTurns out I was right the first time.p  pSo my question, then if I kvetch about this question, do I have a leg to stand on  Or am I missing some distinction between base type and base classp

Negative 8109 pI am beginner of Java.p  pI am trying to read two files and then get the union of them.

For that purpose, I read 100 records at a time, and write them to codefile3code using iteration.p  pAfter that, like codefile1code, this time I read second file as 100 records at a time, and write them to the array, codememory[]code. Then I find the common records, if the record which I read from codefile2code is not in codefile1code, I write it to the output file.

Negative 8109 pIm trying to use RabbitMq in a more unconventional way though at this point i can pick any other message queue implementation if needed. Instead of leaving Rabbit push messages to my consumers, the consumer connects to a queue and fetches a batch of N messages during which it consumes some and possible rejects some, after which it jumps to another queue and so on. This is done for redundancy. If some consumers crash all messages are guaranteed to be consumed by some other consumer.p  pThe problem is that I have multiple consumers and I dont want them to compete over the same queue. Is there a way to guarantee a lock on a queue If not, can I at least make sure that if 2 consumers are connected to the same queue they dont read the same message Transactions might help me to some degree but Ive heard talk that theyll get removed from RabbitMQ.p  pOther architectural suggestions are welcomed too.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong As pointed in the comment theres an a particularity in how I need to process the messages. They only make sense taken in groups and theres a high probability that related messages are clumped together in a queue. If for example I pull a batch of 100 messages, theres a high probability that Ill be able to do something with messages 13, 45,610 etc. If I fail to find a group for some messages Ill resubmit them to the queue. WorkQueue wouldnt work because it would spread messages from the same group to multiple workers that wouldnt know what to do with them.p

Negative 8109 pI am currently working on an iPhone project in which all labelstext views etc. should appear with a custom font Im using Xcode 4.2.1. I have done some research on this, and the only solution seems to be adding the font files to the project, editing the info.plist file appropriately and setting the font programmatically i.e. by outlets or by subclassing the relevant views. In any case, these approaches wont lead to the interface builder displaying the text with the custom font it will still show Helvetica. It is not possible to select the custom font using the attributes inspector.p  pAlthough I dont think I missed something, I just want to make sure there is no other way than programmatically setting the fonts, which would be a rather painful for the task I have to work on localization issues, unique app design etc..

I am perfectly happy with one time databinding so I was kind of hoping to avoid learning about dependency properties and all the databinding stuff for this simple scenario.p  pHere is the XAML for the user controlp  precodeltTextBlockgtJust SomethingltTextBlockgt codepre  pAnd the code behindp  precodenamespace TestWindowsPhoneApplication      public partial class TestControl  UserControl              public TestData SomeProperty  get set          public String SomeStringProperty  get set           public TestControl                      InitializeComponent                codepre  pMainPage.xamlp  precodeltItemsControl NameitemsList ItemsSourceBindinggt     ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt         ltDataTemplategt             lttTestControl SomeStringPropertyBinding PathSomeStringgtlttTestControlgt             ltltTextBlock TextBinding PathSomeStringgtltTextBlockgtgt         ltDataTemplategt     ltItemsControl.ItemTemplategt ltItemsControlgt codepre  pHere is MainPage.xaml.csp  precodenamespace TestWindowsPhoneApplication      public class TestData              public string SomeString  get set            public partial class MainPage  PhoneApplicationPage               Constructor         public MainPage                      InitializeComponent             itemsList.DataContext  new TestData[]  new TestData  SomeString  Test1 , new TestData  SomeString  Test2                  codepre  pWhen I run the project I get an error the parameter is incorrect.

Negative 8109 pI am producing reports that are comprised of 4 chapters, an introduction chapter and 3 dynamically created chapters. The 3 dynamic chapters are produced separately, and then inserted after the introduction chapter and saved as a single unit. The three dynamic chapters are working fine and look as they should, and other than the missing images the combined version looks as it should as well. p  pOne of the dynamic chapters uses the InsertFile method to bring in 6 images that are saved as RTF files. I cant change the format of the incoming images, and since they are not technically images I have to insert them as text. This does not present an issue when the chapter is by itself, as they appear as they should. However, when the chapters are combined, these images are lost. I am also combining the 4 documents introduction  3 dynamic chapters using the InsertFile method. p  pSo far Ive confirmed that if I manually insert the problematic dynamic chapter into a blank document it also loses the images. The chapters are saved to a local drive. I have also confirmed that if I move the chapter file to a network drive, it seems to import fine however, thats not an option.p  pDoes this problem sound familiar to anyonep

Negative 8109 pIm building an Airport Taxi Booking System and as part of the table that holds the bookings there are the following columns along with other data which I dont need for this examplep  precodeCustomer Name  Outbounddate Outboundtime Outboundpickup Outbounddestination  Inbounddate Inboundtime Inboundpickup Inbounddestination codepre  pI am building a page that displays all bookings between two dates inputted by the user, the results are then displayed in a HTML table with the following headings  Name, pickup, destination, date, time. p  pWhat I would like to do is build an if statement that asks if the inbound or outbound date is nearest and then displaying the journey information. I need all this in a loop for the HTML table. p  pIm roughly assuming the statement would ask if codeoutbounddatecode lt codeinbounddatecode codeecho outbounddestinationcode etc... Else codeecho inbounddestinationcode etc...p  pThis is the code I have which selects data and displays it, however it currently selects both the outboundpickupdestinationdate and the inbound versions. What I want to do is just show either the outboundinbound columns, depending which falls between the two dates submitted by the user.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN    httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt  lthtml langengt ltheadgt     ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtComputerised Booking System  Airport Hopperlttitlegt     ltmeta namegenerator contentTextMate httpmacromates.comgt     ltmeta nameauthor contentDaniel Greengt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss href..cssmain.cssgt     lt Date 20120227 gt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idwrappergt ltphp include..includesheader.phpgt ltphp include..includescbssidebar.phpgt  ltdiv classmaincontainergt lth2gtAirport Hopper CBSlth2gtlthrgt ltphp dbhost  ahopperintranet.db.8239985.hostedresource.com dbuser  ahopperintranet dbpwd    database  ahopperintranet table  bookings  if mysqlconnectdbhost, dbuser, dbpwd     dieCant connect to database  if mysqlselectdbdatabase     dieCant select database   sending query result  mysqlquerySELECT bookingref, customername, outbounddestination, outbounddate, outboundtime, inbounddate FROM table ORDER BY GREATESToutbounddate, inbounddate if result      dieQuery to show fields from table failed   fieldsnum  mysqlnumfieldsresult  echo lttable border1gtlttrgt  gt   lttrgt     lttdgtBooking Reflttdgt     lttdgtCustomer Namelttdgt     lttdgtPickuplttdgt             lttdgtDestinationlttdgt             lttdgtDatelttdgt             lttdgtTimelttdgt  lttrgt  ltphp  printing table rows whilerow  mysqlfetchrowresult      echo lttrgt       row is array... foreach ..  puts every element      of row to cell variable     foreachrow as cell         echo lttdgtcelllttdgt      echo lttrgtn  mysqlfreeresultresult gt ltdiv classcleargtltdivgt ltbodygt codepre

Negative 8109 pI am doing some image processing and need to change the values of a bayer filter. I am using c and basically want to multiply red values by a certain scalar and then green values by another and blue values by a third scalar.  Is there any way to tell what the value is  I would like to run something likep  precodeforint i  0 i lt this.pixelBuffer.Length i      if pixelBuffer[i]  blueValue          this.pixelBuffer[i]  1.2          if pixelBuffer[i]  greenValue          this.pixelBuffer[i]  .9          if pixelBuffer[i]  redValue          this.pixelBuffer[i]  1.5        codepre  pAlthough if I could find out the pattern of the bayer synthesis beforehand somehow then I could just run three for loops on those different values.p  pSo basically I just need to know how to find out what the pattern is beforehand or to somehow tell what type of pixel each pixel is.p  pI am working with raw image data that is all written in hexadecimal.p  pThanks in advance for any help and let me know if you need any more informationp

Negative 8109 pClient has a financial services website where he gets CSV spreadsheets full of leads every morning. Usually they are about 10k  15k records in each sheet.  What he would like to do is upload that spreadsheet, have the server parse through it, check his database for duplicate leads, insert them into his database, check the records against an external API, and email the qualified leads.p  pRight now I have built him a makeshift utility that does all this but it would seem the server and the database are overstressed by doing this many.  He has to cut them up into 1000 record packets but this annoys him. It uploads the file, loops through the spreadsheet and does everything above except it just cant handle that much at a time.p  pSo my question is does anybody have some general advice about how you might handle something like this, anything you might consider for something like this  In particular being able to upload a single file and then not have to worry about it the rest of the day would put a huge smile on his face.  p  pHere is how Im currently processing these records dont laughp  precodeltphp standard php file upload handler includeupload.inc.php  conn  mysqlconnectlocalhost,username,password  mysqlselectdbdatabase,conn    ifFILES[csvFile][name]   uploaddir  SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT] . uploadfiles  listfile,errMsg  uploadcsvFile,uploaddir,     clear the db table  sql  DELETE FROM tempTable  result  mysqlquerysql or dieError  . mysqlerror . ltbrgt     process the file  row  1  fileName  uploaddir . file  if handle  fopenfileName, r  FALSE   while data  fgetcsvhandle, 1000, ,  FALSE   num  countdata   write the data to mysql duplicate checker table  sql  INSERT INTO tempTable processdate,firstname,middlename,lastname,ssn,dob,dlnumber,dlstate,gender,militaryactive,amountrequested,residencetype,residencelength,address1,address2,city, state,zip,phonehome,phonecell,contacttime,email,ipaddr,payfrequency,netincome,firstpayday,secondpayday,employmentstatus,employername,jobtitle,hiredate,phonework,phonework2, bankname,accounttype,directdeposit,reference1firstname,reference1lastname,reference1relationship,phonereference1,reference2firstname,reference2lastname,reference2relationship, phonereference2,routingno,accountno VALUES  .mysqlescapestringdata[0].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[1].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[2].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[3].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[4].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[5].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[6].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[7].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[8].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[9].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[10].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[11].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[12].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[13].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[14].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[15].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[16].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[17].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[18].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[19].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[20].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[21].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[22].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[23].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[24].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[25].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[26].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[27].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[28].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[29].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[30].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[31].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[32].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[33].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[34].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[35].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[36].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[37].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[38].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[39].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[40].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[41].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[42].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[43].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[44].,  .mysqlescapestringdata[45].  result  mysqlquerysql or dieError  . mysqlerror . ltbrgt  numRows  echo ltbrgt    fclosehandle     now look for duplicates  sql1  SELECT accountno,count FROM tempTable GROUP BY accountno  result1  mysqlquerysql1 or dieError  . mysqlerror . ltbrgt  whilelistacct,numcount  mysqlfetchrowresult1    if there is more than one delete all of them  ifnumcountgt1   echo acct acct, num numcountltbrgt  toBeRemovednumcount  sqldelete  DELETE FROM tempTable WHEREaccountno  acct  resultdelete  mysqlquerysqldelete or dieError  . mysqlerror . ltbrgt    else   echo acct acct, num numcountltbrgt         now remove the duplicates who are already in the customer table  sql2  SELECT accountno FROM customerTable  result2  mysqlquerysql2 or dieError  . mysqlerror . ltbrgt  whilelistacct  mysqlfetchrowresult2   echo acct acct, num numcountltbrgt  sqldelete  DELETE FROM tempTable WHEREaccountno  acct  resultdelete  mysqlquerysqldelete or dieError  . mysqlerror . ltbrgt     now send the user to the new page with more options HeaderLocation finish.php          gt    lthtmlgt ltbodygt ltphp   ifemptyGET[msg]   msg  GET[msg]  echo ltstronggtmsgltstronggt    gt ltform methodpost actionltphp echo SERVER[PHPSELF] gt enctypemultipartformdatagt Upload CSV File ltinput typefile namecsvFile size30gt ltinput typesubmitgt ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 8109 pIm designing a ticket system in PHPMySQL. Each ticket represents one row in the tickets table. Users can add multiple comments to each ticket.p  pWhen viewing a ticket I just do an SQL query on the comments table to select all comments linked to the corresponsing ticketidp  pHowever, now I have to design a search page, which returns any matching tickets and immediately show part of, e.g. last 5 their linked comments.p  pI have this working by performing the same SQL query I use in the single ticket view page, but repeating this for every matching row in the search query. So if you have 1500 matching rows, that means 1500 SQL queries on the comments table, yes, not very efficient...p  pNow I was wondering Is there a way to join the comments table to the tickets table, but have multiple rows from the comments table squeezed into one columnp  pI was thinking about doing a CONCAT on the comments rows, returning them as commaseperated values, which I could then explode again in php to get an array containing all my comments for each ticket. But is this the most effective way or is there something betterp  pstrongEDITstrong Keep in mind that tickets which dont have any comments yet should also we returned by the queryp

I havent seen any obvious documentation on it, so here goesp  pI have a LINQ to Entities data model and a MVC project. I use a lot of javascriptjquery, so have opted to access my data from the client through a WebAPI as json objects. However, I dont want to pass all the entity object properties though to the client, so I have added separate models to my MVC project in which I handle MVC model validation and Binding to my Views. Also, in order to work with it in my jquery, I have created json versions of the models.p  pThis is only the start of the project and I dont want to start it off on the wrong foot. Having three versions of my models for each entity in my business layer is going to be a nightmare I am sure that the overall structure of my project is a very common one, but cant see many developers settling for such duplication of code. There must be a better way of implementing it.p  pAny thoughts Really appreciate any input.p

Negative 8109 pI have a question regarding float type conversion in Struts2.p  pI have a form that contains a serie of normal input elements.p  pA serie of textfields with an emaddem button by the side of each one is included in the window. Clicking on one of this buttons has the effect of adding an input type hidden inside the form with the value of its correspondent textfield. That value will often be a float number that, this is very important, uses the point format example 1.34.p  pThe inputs created look like thisp  precodeltinput classhiddenmaterial typehidden nameform[0].cantidadformulacion value1.34gt ltinput classhiddenmaterial typehidden nameform[1].cantidadformulacion value1.54gt codepre  pAnyway, the whole proccess is made correctly until the data is used by the server after the form submission. The numbers are present as if the point wouldnt have been placed in the number using the example above, as 134.p  pIf a comma is used as in 1,34, there wouldnt be a problem. But that will not be the case with the users of the system. How could I solve this problemp

Negative 8109 pIm using Rails 2.3.14 here, but its possible problem Im having is not confined to this particular version. This is all association and eager loading functionality that is still around in Rails 3, and has been around well before 2.3.14. Im in the process of upgrading from rails 2.3.8, where I was not having the problem described below.p  pThe code below is a mockup based on a much more complex production system. The classmodule scheme Im outlining is set up like this for a reason. Im actually including a few more details in this mockup than necessary to demonstrate the problem, hopefully make the overall structure of the system more clear.p  pSuppose I have several domain objects that can be driven, including vehicles carstrucks and golf balls. For each of these things, I have an ActiveRecord classp  precodeclass Vehicle lt ActiveRecordBase end  class Car lt Vehicle     include Driveable end  class Truck lt Vehicle     include Driveable end  class GolfBall lt ActiveRecordBase     include Driveable end codepre  pFirst note that codeGolfBallcode is a toplevel model class and the corresponding database table is codegolfballscode. On the other hand, codeCarcode and codeTruckcode are subclasses of codeVehiclecode. The database for vehicles is set up with STI, so codeCarscode and codeTruckscode both correspond to the codevehiclescode table with a codetypecode column differentiator.p  pSecondly, note that Im including a codeDrivablecode module on all the bottomlevel domain objects codeCarcode, codeTruckcode, codeGolfBallcode, and it looks like this in the actual system this module does a lot more too, including settings things up based on the specific including domain objectp  precodemodule Driven     def self.includedbase         base.classeval do             hasone driver, as gt driveable, classname gt self.nameDriver, dependent gt destroy         end     end end codepre  pSo each of these things can have a codeDrivercode, and its using a codeclassnamecode based on the including class name e.g. including class codeCarcode results in a codehasonecode with codeclassname gt CarDrivercode, because each of these referenced classes codeCarDrivercode, etc... contains specific business logic that is necessary for the associations use.p  pThere is a toplevel codeDrivercode class which sets up the polymorphic association, and then a similar subclass hierarchy as above for domain object driversp  precodeclass Driver lt ActiveRecordBase     belongsto driveable, polymorphic gt true end  class VehicleDriver lt Driver end  class CarDriver lt VehicleDriver end  class TruckDriver lt VehicleDriver end  class GolfBallDriver lt Driver end codepre  pThis is based on a single database table codedriverscode, using STI for all subclasses.p  pWith this system in place, I create a new codeCarcode stored in codecarcode below and associate it with a newlycreated codeCarDrivercode like this its split up into these particular sequential steps in this mockup to mirror the way the actual system worksp  precodecar  Car.create CarDriver.createdriveable gt car codepre  pThis created database row in the codevehiclescode table like thisp  precode id   type   ...    1    Car    ... codepre  pAnd a row in the codedriverscode table  like thisp  precode id   driveableid    driveabletype   type         ...   1    1               Vehicle          CarDriver    ... codepre  pcodeVehiclecode is the codedriveabletypecode as opposed to codeCarcode because vehicles are STI. So far so good. Now I open up a rails console and execute a simple command to get a codeCarcode instancep  precodegtgt car  Car.findlast gt ltCar id 1, type Car, ...gt codepre  pAccording to the log, here is the query that was executedp  precodeCar Load 1.0ms SELECT  FROM vehicles WHERE  vehicles.type  Car  ORDER BY vehicles.id DESC LIMIT 1 codepre  pThen I get the codeCarDrivercodep  precodegtgt car.driver gt ltCarDriver id 1, driveableid 1, driveabletype Vehicle, type CarDriver, ...gt codepre  pThis caused this query to be execute.p  precodeCarDriver Load 0.7ms SELECT  FROM drivers WHERE drivers.driveableid  1 AND drivers.driveabletype  Vehicle AND drivers.type  CarDriver  LIMIT 1 codepre  pIf I try to use eager loading, however, I get different results. From a fresh console session, I runp  precodegtgt car  Car.findlast, include gt driveable gt ltCar id 1, type Car, ...gt gtgt car.driver gt nil codepre  pThis results in codenilcode for the driver. Checking the logs, the first statement execute the following queries regular query and eager loading queryp  precodeCar Load 1.0ms SELECT  FROM vehicles WHERE  vehicles.type  Car  ORDER BY vehicles.id DESC LIMIT 1  CarDriver Load 0.8ms SELECT  FROM drivers WHERE drivers.driveableid  1 AND drivers.driveabletype  Car AND drivers.type  CarDriver  LIMIT 1 codepre  pAs you can see, in the eager loading case, the codeCarcode query is identical to the above, but the codeCarDrivercode query is different. Its mostly the same, except that for codedrivers.driveablecode type it is looking for codeCarcode where it shouldbe looking for the STI base class name, codeVehiclecode, as it does in the noneager loading case.p  pAny idea how to fix thisp

Negative 8109 pIm writing a GP that I need some advice on for crossover and mutation operations.  The GP is attempting to find the best solution for a matrix that has hard row constraints and softer column constraints.  p  pFor a given solution in the population, the rows contain a random combination of object type ids from a fixed set.  The GP is trying to find a solution where, after the rows are laid out, if you tally the ids in each column, the number of each type must fall within a recommended range for that id.  I wrote a fitness function that allows me to grade the solution on how close it comes to the columns constraints  100 being all the columns fall within specs.p  pWhere I need a little advice is on my crossover.  Parents are chosen from solutions with higher fitness scores.  I have a onepoint crossover where I slice some rows from the top of the father and the complimentary bottom rows from the mother to generate the offspring.  I cant slice by column because that would almost always make the solution infeasible.p  pDoes this approach seem reasonable for crossover  Im worried that not enough good genetic material passes from generation to generation to ultimately make this feasible.  For mutation, I just plan on rerandomizing a row or two and checking the new fitness score for the solution.p  pThanks for any advice as I plod along.p

So for example, I want to make sure that the first data field is always at offset zero from the address of the object. Now, this is trivial for purely POD types. Im wondering, however, if this can also work with objects that have inheritance or have constructors, as long as I avoid obvious things like virtual functions or multiple inheritance. Is it reasonable to assume that the compiler will layout these types the same way a C compiler would, or would the unspecified behavior in the C standard be something I would need to worry aboutp

Negative 8109 pThe problem is, in our company we have a project with multiple submodules, however one of the submodules is just a collection of API declarations and is meant for other 3rd praty projects to use. I want to keep it as a submodule because is easier to maintain and build dependency and property inheritance. Other submodules in this project are also dependant on it. p  pThe question I have is, if there exist a good practice or a nice way to execute a deploy phase that will upload just this submodule to a different repository can be duplicated too without it having a dependency to parent pom.p  pWhat I have already tried I have already checked the deploydeployfile, but the problem is when it comes to SNAPSHOT builds. We wish to be able to publish SNAPSHOTS and release builds, and snapshots have different repository than release ones, but deployfile goal can only have one url parameter. I do not wish to use different profile for snapshot deploy. Than I tried to use maven buildhelper and its regexproperty to be able to change the repository url if the version is a SNAPSHOT, but was unable to do so because of the plugin and regex limitations.p  pThe last option is I can make a plugin for this, but I wish to know if there is a more elegant way to solve this the maven way.p

Although the task emdoesem get added to the todo list, I get redirected to an incorrect URL.

Negative 8109 pIm new to R, so I apologize if this is a straightforward question, however Ive done quite a bit of searching this evening and cant seem to figure it out. Ive got a data frame with a whole slew of variables, and what Id like to do is create a table of the correlations among a subset of these, basically the equivalent of pwcorr in Stata, or correlations in SPSS. The one key to this is that not only do I want the r, but I also want the significance associated with that value.p  pAny ideas This seems like it should be very simple, but I cant seem to figure out a good way.p

Negative 8109 pI have a database that is holding real estate MLS Multiple Listing Service data. Currently, I have a single table that holds all the listing attributes price, address, sqft, etc.. There are several different property types residential, commercial, rental, income, land, etc. and each property type share a majority of the attributes, but there are a few that are unique to that property type.p  pMy question is the shared attributes are in excess of 250 fields and this seems like too many fields to have in a single table. My thought is I could break them out into an EAV EntityAttributeValue format, but Ive read many bad things about that and it would make running queries a real pain as any of the 250 fields could be searched on. If I were to go that route, Id literally have to pull all the data out of the EAV table, grouped by listing id, merge it on the application side, then run my query against the in memory object collection. This also does not seem very efficient.p  pI am looking for some ideas or recommendations on which way to proceed. Perhaps the 250 field table is the only way to proceed.p  pJust as a note, Im using SQL Server 2012, .NET 4.5 w Entity Framework 5, C and data is passed to asp.net web application via WCF service.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8109 pMy original RCP was started in 3.x and currently I am running it on Juno with the compatibility layer. I was looking into doing a soft migration so I have started to slowly change my practices. One of the things I am doing is to change my actions into commands.p  pI have a view which is like a directory explorer currently that adds actions to the toolbar and popup menu of the view. These actions call specific methods in the view, for example to go up one directory.p  pIt was easy to do this by action because I just create my action in the View class itself and programmatically add them to the toolbarp  precodeIToolBarManager mgr  getViewSite.getActionBars.getToolBarManager         mgr.addupDirectory         mgr.addrefresh         mgr.addchangeRoot codepre  pand the creation of the actions are called from the codecreatePartControlcodep  precodeupDirectory  new ActionGo up one directory              public void run                  goUpOneDirectory                       codepre  pwhere codegoUpOneDirectorycode is a method in the view p  pIf I want to convert this to a command, I want to be able to access this method of the view in my handler. So I tried the following,p  precodeprivate void createHandlers              IHandlerService handlerService  IHandlerService getSite.getServiceIHandlerService.class IHandler upDirHandler  new AbstractHandler              public Object executeExecutionEvent event                     throws ExecutionException                  goUpOneDirectory                 return null                               handlerService.activateHandlerupdir.id, upDirHandler      codepre  pAnd codecreateHandlerscode is called in the codecreatePartControlcode, and the command is added via the plugin.xml to the toolbar of the view. The problem is that the moment my view is out of focus it disables the buttons in the toolbar for these commands.p  pI want them to remain enabled at all times. How can I do thatp  pI know that the codeisEnabledcode returns true all the time so I am not sure why it happens. The activateHanlder is called once in codecreatePartControlcode so I feel that it should remain active all the time.p  pEdit Ok I just saw a hrefhttphelp.eclipse.orgjunoindex.jsptopicorg.eclipse.platform.doc.isvguideworkbenchcmdhandlers.htm relnofollowthisa ,p  blockquote   pIHandlerService from the workbench part site is the part handler   service. Any handlers activated through the part handlers service will   only be active when that part is active. Any listeners added to the   part handler service will be removed when the part is disposed, and   any active handlers will be deactivated but not disposed.p blockquote  pSo how can I get this,p  blockquote   pIHandlerService from the workbench is the global handler service. it   provides no special activation scoping or lifecycle.p blockquote

Negative 8109 pIve recently been introduced to git in a project Ive started working on, which encouraged me to start reading the online version of Pro Git by Scott Chacon.p  pThere is a section in the book which briefly touches the subject of adding a remote repository. Since Git is a distributed SCM, I understand that a common situation of using GIT would be to clone a remote repository on your local machine and work on your local copy. When youre done with your changes and committed all changes to your local copy, you then push your changes to the remote repository so others can view your changes too.p  pWhich brings me to my question  from what Ive understood, git remote add effectively adds a remote repository as a shorthand notation which we can use later. What I dont understand is this  since I clone by only specifying one repository URL, how can I add multiple repository urls under my local projects directoryp  pTo be precise, suppose I check out the Apache commonslang project usingp  precodegit clone gitgit.apache.orgcommonslang.git codepre  pThis results in GIT copying over the whole project in my local directory named commonslang. Since Ive used only one url for cloning, what does doing a remote add mean here Does it mean that the same project commonslang could be hosted on multiple servers, or is it that I could clone a new project within my local project by adding a new remote addressp  pApologies for beginnerlike tone of the question. Just trying to get my facts dead straight. Thanks.p

Negative 8109 pProblem I am trying to create an app whereby a person can click on tag buttons that are of different sports preferences ie Running, Involves Bats, each of which are tagged to certain sports. So, if the user selects the tag Involves Bats, then the app will generate all associated sports such as Baseball, which would have Involves Bats as a pre built tag.p  pWhat Ive Done So Far I have added the actsastaggable gem I have created a model for Sports, that has no controller. I have in seeds.rb created defined the Sports model with names of each sport. I have a Users controller, where someone can submit email which takes to them to the their user page.p  pWhat is Left I need to tag all preferences ie Running to all potential Sports. I am having a really difficult time doing this. I also need to on the Users Page, show the tags Running from which to choose. I need to let User select the tags, and then generate the recommendations of Sports based on the associated tagsp  pI know this is a fairly complex question, but I believe is a fairly commonbasic app to build.p  pThanksp

Negative 8109 pIm trying to transform a path along an arc. p  pMy project is running on osX 10.8.2 and the painting is done via CoreAnimation in CALayers. p  pThere is a waveform in my project which will be painted by a path. There are about 200 sample points which are mirrored to the bottom side. These are painted 60 times per second and updated to a song postion.p  pPlease ignore the white line, it is just a rotation indicator.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwSGfa.png altsituationp  pWhat i am trying to achieve is drawing a waveform along an arc. Up should point to the middle. It does not need to go all the way around. The waveform should be painted along the green circle. Please take a look at the sketch provided below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXSyYS.jpg altwhat i want to achievep  pIm not sure how to achieve this in a performant manner. There are many points per second that need coordinate correction.p  pI tried coming up with some ideas of my ownp  p1 There is the possibility to add linear transformations to paths, which, i think, will not help me here. The only thing i can think of is adding a point, rotating the path with a transformation, adding another point, rotating and so on. But this would be very slow i thinkp  p2 Drawing the path into an image and bending it would surely lead to imageartifacts.p  p3 Maybe the best idea would be to precompute sample points on an arc, then save save a vector to the center. Taking the ycoordinates of the waveform, placing them on the sample points and moving them along the vector to the center.p  pBut maybe i am just not seeing some kind of easy solution to this problem. Help is really appreciated and fresh ideas very welcome. Thank you in advancep

Negative 8109 pHere is my issue..p  pI currently have a code built so I can import my XML data via the URL.  The problem is when I use this code it drops off any columns that have no data.  I need those columns to be included because I have preset formulas that populate other sheets with data.  I figured I would need an XML mapping in order to do so.  I then created a code so the XML Mapping is brought into the file via the XSD URL.  After walking through the VBA step by step, I noticed the correct XSD mapping is brought into the file via the code belowp  precodeDim strRestXSD As String References URL to retrieve XSD Dim oMap As xmlmap Set oMap  ActiveWorkbook.XmlMaps.AddstrRestXSD codepre  pThe problem is within the code below.  I use the code below to then extract the XML, using the string attached to the XML URL. For whatever reason, the ImportMap is ignored when wanting to using the XMLMap identified above.  The code below actually creates a new map and ignores the map which is created using the code above.p  precodeDim strRestURL As String XML data  ActiveWorkbook.XmlImport URLstrRestURL, ImportMapoMap, OverwriteFalse, DestinationRangeA1 amp lngRow codepre  pIs anyone aware of a way I can import my XML data without losing the empty columns Or are you aware of a way I can map my XML map to the XML Importp  pThanks in advance for your helpp  pAli Akbarip

Negative 8109 pIm trying to search for the nearest N points in a quad tree and using an STL priority queue to store the points as they are found sorted by distance from the query point.p  pPoints exceeding a max distance from the query point are never added to the queue.  However, I also would like to cut off the number of items that can be returned by the search.  Currently, I add all points which are closer to the query point than the max distance, and then only read the top N points from the queue.p  pIn testing, this is too slow  simply adding every point closer than the max distance ends up slowing down as more points are added.  I would instead like to only add more points to the queue if either there are fewer than N points currently in the queue, or the point in question is closer to the query point than the Nth point in the queue, in which case that point is overriden, and does not increase the number of elements in the queue.p  pIs there a way to do this with the STL priority queue, or is my only option to write my ownp

In the meantime, the underlying data that matches the criteria might have changed, and the visible table might have been resorted by jQuery, so rather than using the original WHERE clause again, I thought it would be safer to collect the IDs from the visible table and pass them to the query.  Consider this example of such a queryp  precodeSELECT t2.OtherField FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.JoinIDt2.JoinID WHERE t1.MyID in 1417,2120,217,590,6566,11764 ORDER BY FINDINSETt1.MyID,1417,2120,217,590,6566,11764 codepre  pNow imagine that the number of IDs in the list could be far more than that hundreds, or even thousands if the user is not being thoughtful.  Repeating the same long list in codeWHEREcode and codeFINDINSETcode seems excessive.  Is there a way to get the same result while using the list of IDs only once  I tried this, but it didnt work the first six results were older records, not the six in the listp  precodeSELECT t2.OtherField FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.JoinIDt2.JoinID ORDER BY FINDINSETt1.MyID,1417,2120,217,590,6566,11764 LIMIT 6 codepre  pOr does it not even matter if the query is huge due to the repeated list  Or, if Im going about this all wrong and you have a different idea, Id love to hear it.p

Negative 8109 pSo our team has recently implemented torquebox into our jruby on rails applications. The purpose of this was to be able to receive queuetopic messages from an outside source which is streaming live data.p  pWe have setup our queuestopics and they are receiving the messages without an issue. The next step we want to take is to get these messages on the browser.p  pSo we started to look into leveraging the power of stomp. But we have come across some issues with this. It seems from the documentation that the purpose of using stomp  websockets is to receive messages from the clientside and push those messages to other clients. But we want to receive messages on our queues, and then push these messages to the clientside using websockets. Is this possible Or would we have to implement a different technology such as Pusher or socket.io to get the queuetopic messages to the browserp  pThanks.p

How would i ensure that new processes get their own zmq sockets p  pEDIT the main deal in my app is that a request comes in via zmq socket, and a processs thats listening reacts to the message by  p  precode1. If its directed at that process judged by the id field, do some reading on a file and reply since one of the monitors match the messages id, if none match, then 2  If the messages id files is not recognized, all monitors ignore it but the Prefect creates a process to handle that id and all future messages to that id. 3. I want all the messages to be seen by the monitor processes as well as the prefect process, seems that seems easiest,  4. All the messages are very small, avarage 4096 bytes.    5. The monitor does some nonblocking read and for each ioloop it sends what it has found out codepre  pmoreeditand the prefect process binds now, and it will receive messages and echo them so they can be seen by monitors. This is what i have in mind, as the architecture but its not final.     . p  pAll the messages are arriving from remote users over a browser that lets the server know what a client wants  and the server sends the message to the backend via zmqi did not show this, but is not hard  so in production they might not bindconnect to localhost.  I chose DEALER since it allows asyc  unlimited messages in either direction see point 5. and DEALER can bind with DEALER, and initial requestreply can arrive from  either side. The other that can do this is possibly DEALERROUTER.p

Negative 8109 pSo with collection view, you MUST register a nibclass before trying to dequeue itp  precode LOAD UP THE NIB FILE FOR THE CELL UINib nib  [UINib nibWithNibNameCustomNibCell bundlenil]   REGISTER THE NIB FOR THE CELL WITH THE TABLE [self.collectionView registerNibnib forCellWithReuseIdentifierCustomNibCellId] codepre  pHowever, if I have to do that, I dont know where to customize my CustomNibCell. I dont want to customize the fontfont size in cellForItemAtIndexPath because it shouldnt be done every single time if Im dequeueing a cell. And I cant do it in  idinitWithCoderNSCodercoder because the IBOutlets have not been intialized yet.p  pUsually in TableViews you would just dequeue it and if its nil, you would customize it only once. How do I do it, when I dont have the luxury of knowing when the heck the XIB is createdp
Negative 8109 pI am trying to write a level2 Sfunction for use in system identification live during a simulation using the n4sid function. However, it does not appear that the output of the n4sid function, an idss datatype, is supported in the output. Is there a way to output this data type from an Sfunction Alternatively, can this data type be used internally in an Sfunction and fed directly into another Matlab function inside the Sfunction code Thanks.p

Negative 8109 pIn Oracle,  Lets say there are 3 tables with primary key and foreign key on each table. So, If i were to start creating the tables, how would i start. I started to create a first table with primary and foreign key but It dont let me create a table when there is foreign key mentioned without creating other referenced table.  if this the case, I cant create any of this tables, Because i foreign key on all 3 tables and primary on each table.  Note Yeah, I know i could add the constraint later. but im curious to know, how does thing kind of issue work in real world programming. do developers add the foreign constraint later or ummmm just curious.p

Negative 8109 pI am working on a web app that uses, Apache CXF webservices and Spring MVC. Note that these are deployed as 2 separate applications in tomcat. The Spring MVC app only provides a web interface and calls webservices exposed by the CXF application. Now I have been assigned the task to redesign the whole thing.  The first thing that comes to my mind is to merge the two applications, take out CXF, and just use Spring MVC to avoid the latency introduced by calling CXF webservices from Spring MVC controller.p  pHowever there is another aspect that needs to be considered before I do this. There are some webservices that are heavily used than others and in future under heavy load it would be optimal to move these webservices to a separate application to be deployed on a separate server. In that case it would be better to keep the two applications separate and move only those of the CXF webservices to the separate server and get going.p  pI would like to hear your thoughts on this , to decide on a way to go forward.p  pThanksp

I am mainly using Enterprise Architect for data modelling, and all the attributes should be public.p  pCurrently I have to manually change the scope from Private to Public for every single attribute I add, so I would save me quite some time if I could someway set the default scope for new attributes to Public.p

Negative 8109 pOkay, basically we have the a hrefhttpwww.sajithmr.mejrecorderjqueryjRecordera implemented in our website which provides the ability for us to capture audio in WAV format.p  pNow, after the capture, we use the a hrefhttpsgithub.comkikkoShineMP3EncoderonAS3AlchemyShineMP3Encodera to convert that WAV to MP3 to save on file size. This all works fine.p  pNumerous people have encountered an issue in that if the recorded audio levels are too high, MP3 encoding will completely stop and the file will become corruptshort.

Negative 8109 pThis is really simple, when i click a radiobutton in the radiobuttonlist I want to set the value of a label.

Negative 8109 pIm in the process of porting a C library to WinRT. It uses Winsock. Winsock isnt supported in WinRT. Microsoft directs you to use Windows.Networking.Sockets instead. Im running into questions trying to map the Winsock API to the Windows.Networking.Sockets API. Ive used sockets in managed code, but not in C. Im unfamiliar with the Winsock API.p  pIm sure I will run up against other questions, but first off, I need to determine the right way to get socket error codes. I think this is the correct mapping WSAGetLastError  SocketError.GetStatushresultli p  pCorrectp  ul liThis doc details possible error codes using winsock bra hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms740668vvs.85.aspx relnofollowWindows Sockets Error Codesali liThis doc details an enumeration which I think is the equivalent, but is very different bra hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappswindows.networking.sockets.socketerrorstatus.aspx relnofollowSocketErrorStatus enumerationali ul  pThe number of error codes is very different between these two. Also, WSAGetLastError returns the error status for the last Windows Sockets operation that failed, where SocketError.GetStatushresult requires an hresult as input, presumably from exception handling of a specific attempted operation. This is going to require a good bit of refactoring to make this change, so I want to make sure Ive got it right before I do the work.p  pLastly, is there a document someone can refer me to that defines the mapping Im looking forp

Negative 8109 pI am looking for a tool to keep track of my servers, we use chefsolo everywhere but its hard to keep track. Any simple tool to keep track of servers like Spacewalk, but then simplifiedp  pI use spacewalk for some servers I admin, but its a bit too bloated for what I want now. But how it does work great. We kickstart servers using chefsolo then register it with a static key with spacewalk. So we have a nice overview of all the servers and servers that didnt callback after X time.p  pWe really like the concept of chefsolo and does not want chefserver for many reasons. But what is missing in our infrastructure is a simple tool, a simple web interface to keep track of the servers.p  pThank you.p

Negative 8109 pI have a fairly simple chat app written in node.js which does not use a database. The application implement socket.io and consists of two code files, one being the client side with the JQuery,html,css, and node logic and the other file is the server file. The way I have it working is all users get assigned a socket object with their username attached to it as a property. The socket objects are then stored in a single array on the server side, my question is, when I deploy the application and the user executes my code will the server side code be running locally on their machine and if this is so then does that mean my application will not work because then obviously only they would be in the array. Basically Im asking would this approach work for a realtime network applicationp

Negative 8109 pI am investigating the system tables within the SYS Schema in Apache Derby. I have a database that uses the Apache Derby RDBMS and I have added three tables to it called Accounts, Customers and Employees. The database runs behind a Java application that runs queries against these three tables to perform any one of the CRUD functions these queries work fine so no issue therep  pWhat I want to do is to get meta data about the tables I created through the system tables in the database the table names, column names, data in the tables etc using SQL not Javas classes, which I do know about rather than simply querying the actual tables themselves. Ive looked at the reference to the tables on the a hrefhttpdb.apache.orgderbydocs10.3refrrefsistabs38369.html relnofollowDerby system tablesa page and I think that the tables that I should be focusing on are SYSCOLUMNS and SYSTABLES. Whats odd is that SYSTABLES shows information about my tables but SYSCOLUMNS does not.p  pThere are other tables in the SYS schema that contain data about my tables, such as SYSCONTSTRAINTS, SYSFOREIGNKEYS, SYSKEYS and  as mentioned above SYSTABLES. So to me its somewhat peculiar that SYSCOLUMNS doesnt also have information about my tables inside them.p  pWhen I actually run a query against SYSCOLUMNS I get this errorp  precodeError code 20000, SQL state XN020 Error marshalling or unmarshalling a user defined type org.apache.derby.catalog.types.TypeDescriptorImpl codepre  pI think this refers to the COLUMNDATATYPE column based on reading the reference of the SYSCOLUMNS table in the link above but I have looked at other pages and dont really understand it.p  pIf it helps here are the columns and data types for my tablesp  pstrongCUSTOMERSstrongp  pCUSTOMERID Integer Primary Key Autoincrement starts at 1, increments by 1p  pFULLNAME Varchar 50p  pstrongACCOUNTSstrongp  pACCOUNTID Integer Primary Key Autoincrement starts at 1, increments by 1p  pCUSTOMER ID Integer foreign key references CUSTOMERID in CUSTOMERp  pACCOUNTTYPE Varchar 50p  pBALANCE Doublep  pCREDITLIMIT Doublep  pstrongEMPLOYEESstrongp  pEMPLOYEEID Integer Primary Key Autoincrement starts at 1, increments by 1p  pFULLNAME Varchar 50p  pUSERNAME Varchar 50p  pPASSWORD Varchar 50p  pApologies but I cant post any screenshots due to reputation rules Im signed in on my Google account. The gist of it is SYSTABLES has data about my tables and SYSCOLUMNS doesnt and I think the above error is the cause, but I dont understand what the error is and how to fix it if at allp

Negative 8109 pAs in many Java apps, were using Freemarker in our app to render emails. Weve found that some of our templates werent rendering exactly as we thought they would, and so we realized that we ought to write some unit tests for our template rendering. Well I set up the tests, and immediately received a FileNotFoundException emTemplate mytemplate.ftl not found.emp  pI figured that this must be both a solved problem with an easy solution. That was many work hours ago, and I realized that I was wrong from what I can tell, this is neither solved nor easyp  pOur apps setup is, I think, pretty standard. We have a Maven project, and store our Freemarker templates in srcmainwebappWEBINFfreemarker. Although most of our apps functionality is initiated by Quartz jobs, we deploy it as a webapp. Therefore the following configuration in our spring XML file is all that we needp  precodeltbean idfreemarkerConfiguration     classorg.springframework.ui.freemarker.FreeMarkerConfigurationFactoryBeangt     ltproperty nametemplateLoaderPath valueWEBINFfreemarker gt ltbeangt codepre  pThen in our code, we Autowire the bean in like sop  precodeAutowired protected Configuration freemarkerConfiguration codepre  pand use it like sop  precodeTemplate template  freemarkerConfiguration.getTemplatemailjobdetail.ftl codepre  pThat works great in the context of our deployed app, executing within a Quartz job. But we always get the template not found when running from within unit tests.p  pI tried many different approaches, none of which worked. The last involved creating my own Freemarker TemplateLoader implementation, and trying to get it to load the Freemarker template files form the classpath. The problems with that approach are that a the same classloading code that I successfully use elsewhere in tests would not find the template, b Im not sure all that is involved with correctly implementing a TemplateLoader, and c this all just seems overlycomplicated in general.p  pI may continue this route, but first... am I missing something obvious One of Freemarkers benefits is that it doesnt require an HTTP context, so why would it be so difficult to use Freemarker outside of a web app contextp

So no extra memory is allocated here, right  But then, is the codeFoocode class responsible for providing a destructor that deallocates codemyDatacodes memory  Or do we have a dynamic array pointer that actually points to stack memoryp  pAlso, if I want to protect codeFoocodes codemyDatacode from changing when codemainDatacode is changed, is there a simple way to force the codeFoocode constructor to copy it  Ideally codemyDatacode would be a simple array, not a pointer, but changing the line codedouble myDatacode to codedouble myData[]code doesnt seem to work because the size of the array is unknown until runtime.p

Negative 8109 pIve converted a whole heap of datestrings into unix timestamps as milliseconds since epoch.p  pI used the moment.js date library which did a great job except there was one misunderstanding. In Australia, dates are usually represented in the format DDMMYYYY, however American dates are MMDDYYYY and moment seems to have assumed that the dates I parsed are in the American format.p  pThis has lead to dates such as 01102000 to be parsed as the tenth of January rather than the first of October. Ive stored these dates as a number representing moments since epoch, so the date above has been stored as code970322400000code rather than code947426400000code.p  pI want to convert all of the dates Ive calculated into their proper values. I need a function which will take code970322400000code and convert it to code947426400000code for all dates that have been incorrectly calculated.

Negative 8109 pI am trying to build a small CAD app using HTML5 Canvas and a hrefhttppaperjs.org relnofollowPaper.jsap  pNow I am stuck at a problem Id hate asking for help for since I believe I should solve this on my own, but everytime I try to think about a solution my head hurts.p  h2I am trying to build the following functionsh2  ul listrongAlignleftstrongli listrongAlignrightstrongli listrongAligncenter.strongli ul  pThe user is supposed to select a bunch of elements on the canvas and click one of the above functions to align them together.p  pThe whole concept is that the user selects a emReference Itemem in a way. The elements are aligned relativeto the Reference Item. This ensures that the alignments happen in a user predictable way. p  h2There are 2 ways for the user to select elementsh2  ul listrongSelectionviaIntersectionstrongli ul  blockquote   pThe user clicks and drags a emselection rectangleem. While dragging I   can track in an array which items emintersectedem with the selection   rectangle. I can track the first intersected item here just fine, so I   have a emReference Itemem .Works perfectly so far.p blockquote  ul listrongSelectionviaClickShiftstrongli ul  blockquote   pThe user holds Shift and clicks on elements to do a multiselection.   Its a functionality Im sure everyone has seen in any modern graphics   editor.

And unfortunately it doesnt allow us to write code in conventional way, neither allows to use basic coding features if else statements, loops etc. but only supports some inbuilt functions in form of code blocks, and we can only arrange these blocks. FYI, Heres a a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms9f5qc9uki0lsalusaperafunctions.docx relnofollowlinka to a list of functions supported by Sapera.p  pNow, my first objective was to test my algorithm on matlab thereafter implementing it on Sapera.

But the real problem is that for step 3 i.e. connectivity of course I had to write loops going to each pixel checking for connectivity, which cant be done in Sapera. So I am looking for some other simpler algorithm to separate blobs in my images, without using loops and conditional statement, so that it can be implemented in Sapera, but now I just need its matlab code or algorithm.p

Negative 8109 pI was experimenting with C11 and VLAs, trying to declare a struct variable on the stack with only an incomplete declaration. The objective is to provide a mechanism to create a variable of some struct type without showing the internals like the PIMPL idiom but without the need to create the variable on the heap and return a pointer to it. Also, if the struct layout changes, I dont want to recompile every file that uses the struct.p  pI have managed to program the followingp  pprivate.hp  precodeifndef PRIVATEH define PRIVATEH  typedef struct A     int value A  endif  PRIVATEH  codepre  ppublic.hp  precodeifndef PUBLICH define PUBLICH  typedef struct A A  sizet AgetSizeOfvoid  void AsetValueA  a, int value  void AprintValueA  a  endif  PUBLICH  codepre  pimplementation.cp  precodeinclude private.h include stdio.h  sizet AgetSizeOfvoid      return sizeofA   void AsetValueA  a, int value      agtvalue  value   void AprintValueA  a      printfdn, agtvalue  codepre  pmain.cp  precodeinclude ltstdalign.hgt include ltstddef.hgt  include public.h  define createOnStacktype, variable      alignasmaxalignt char variable  stack[type  getSizeOf]      type  variable  type ampvariable  stack  int mainint argc, char argv[]      createOnStackA, var      AsetValuevar, 5335     AprintValuevar  codepre  pI have tested this code and it seems to work. However Im not sure if Im overlooking something like aliasing, alignment or something like that that could be dangerous or unportable, or could hurt performance. Also I want to know if there are better portable solutions to this problem in C.p

Negative 8109 pIn Perl and probably other langauges, you can tie a variable to replace its builtin behavior with userdefined behavior.  For example, a hash table can be tied with custom get and fetch subroutines which, for example, query BerkeleyDB so that data is persistent and not limited by RAM, but still looks and acts like regular hash to Perl.p  pIs something similar possible with R  In particular, I was thinking, since a codedata.framecode looks much like a table in a relational db, that if a codedata.framecode were tied to something like SQLite, it would enable R to handle very large data frames Ive stuffed 100GB into SQLite without any code changes.p

Negative 8109 pI am using Nose 1.1.2 in a test suite with python 2.7 and selenium webdriver. p  pIn the codesetUpcode of my tests, I check to see if the version of the website I am testing has changed since running the last test.   If so, I coderaise SkipTestcode for all subsequent tests.p  pThroughout my tests, information is written to an .ini file.  This is is information I want in a database.p  pI have also written a custom Nose plugin that pushes the info in my .ini to the db during codeafterTestcode.  Everything gets recorded and pushed to the db fine, UNTIL tests start skipping.  Then the information of strongthe test just prior to the skipped teststrong and every subsequent test never gets pushed.p  pSo when Im going along, and I get code[testpassed1, testpassed2, testpassed3, testskipped1, testskipped2, etc]code the information strongisstrong getting pushed to the db for codetestpassed1, testpassed2code but strongnotstrong for codetestpassed3, testskipped1, testskipped2, etccodep  pHeres my nose plugin codep  precodeclass apiLoggingPlugin      name  api     enabled  True     batchini  CSeleniumTestsbatchinfo.ini      def addSuccessself, test, capt         write things to ini      def addErrorself, test, capt, tbinfo         write things to ini      def addFailureself, test, err, capt, tbinfo         write things to ini      def afterTestself, test         push info in ini to db      def finalizeself, result         push final things to db, like timestamp, etc codepre  pI am a bit baffled as to WHY codeafterTestcode is not firing in either the passed test or the skipped tests, especially since codeaddSuccesscode is working for that final passing test I can see it in the .ini.  There is also no problem with codefinalizecode since my db is updated with timestamps and other info even when tests are skipped.p  pAny insight is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 8109 pIm developing a Universal App in c for Windows 8.1p  pIm trying to catch keyboard input and from the online literature have been pointed to emKeyDownem event and emKeyRoutedEventArgsem and the emKeyem property.  This works fine for most key characters and returns emVirtualKeyem enumerations such as VirtualKey.A.  However, when characters such as ,. are pressed the Key property is set to a number and this number is the same value if the key is pressed in combination with VirtualKey.Shift which seems to indicate it is not representative of the characters on the key, but only represents the physical key.p  pAs it happens, Im using an Italian laptop keyboard which of course is laid out differently to a UK Extended keyboard so the Key value for a semicolon  is 186 on a UK keyboard as an unShifted or bottom character and is 188 on an Italian keyboard as a Shift or top character.  Im therefore stumped as far a capturing these punctuation characters.p  pI have developed WPF, Silverlight and .Net app in the past and dont remember it being as difficult to handle physical keyboard input even in combination a game loop, as I just used the Key or Keys enumeration and an OEM value.p  pHow can I capture these punctuation characters when their respective key is pressed, irrespective of the keyboard layoutp

Furthermore, I need to concatenate the ChannelCode column and store it in the Names column of the [AggregatedData] table, but obviously if there is only one record, I dont want to add the .p  pI cant figure out how to do this without using a cursor and a bunch of variables  but Im guessing there HAS to be a better way.

Negative 8109 pI am using the Z3 solver and implementing in C. I have used the example given by Microsoft in the description of their .Net API a hrefhttpz3.codeplex.comSourceControllatestexamplesdotnetProgram.cs relnofollowhttpz3.codeplex.comSourceControllatestexamplesdotnetProgram.csa.

I know that the setting for returning the Unsatcore are correct because when I run the original UnsatCoreAndProofExample function the unsat Core is returned. But when I JUST change the model to the model above although the result is Unsat but no Unsatcore is returned.  So my question is, could it be because of the way I am writing my model or is there another mistake I am makingp

Negative 8109 pI am having an issue with trying to bind a codeComboBoxcode in WinRT.  I am using PrismMVVM.  I am able to bind the codeItemsSourcecode to an codeObservableCollectioncode no problem, and the codeComboBoxcode is being populated.p  pWhat I am having trouble with, is having it automatically select the appropriate value based on the current codeInvoicecode.

The codeInvoicecode has a property called codePayeeIdcode, which as you may guess, is the codeIdcode of the codePayeecode that this codeInvoicecode is associated to.p  pFor some reason, no matter which codeInvoicecode I select, the codeComboBoxcode is blank when I navigate to my page.  By blank, I just mean there is nothing selected, but it is populated with the codePayeescode collection.p  pIf I manually change the selection, and save my codeInvoicecode, the codePayeeIdcode isnt changed.  I think that it probably has something to do with the binding on the codeSelectedValuecode, but so far I have been unable to figure this one out.

However, all is well in the designer.  To further test, I have added a codeTextBoxcode that is bound to codeSelectedPayee.Idcodep  precodeltTextBox Grid.Row7 Grid.Column1 TextBinding PathSelectedPayee.Id gt codepre  pThat displayed the correct number at design time and runtime, and is updated appropriately whenever I change the selection in the codeComboBoxcode.  The only thing that is not working correctly is the codeComboBoxcode is not correctly displaying the codePayeecode codeAccountNamecode when I navigate to the page.  As I said, the design view is correctly displaying the dummy data that I have in my designer codeViewModelcode.  Is there something special about a codeComboBoxcode that I am perhaps doing something in the wrong orderp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI also am getting the exact same results using p  precodeSelectedValueBinding PathSelectedPayee.Id, ModeTwoWay codepre  pThe binding is displaying the correct codePayee.Idcode in the codeTextBoxcode depending on which codePayeecode is selected in the codeComboBoxcode, but it just does not display the codeSelectedPayeecode when I first navigate to the page but the codeTextBoxcode will be populated with the correct codeIdcode.  This is really a head scratcher to me....p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI got it all straightened out.  The final issue I had going was I was setting the codeSelectedPayeecode before actually loading the codeComboBoxcode, so there was no property changes to trigger the codeSelectedValuecode of the codeComboBoxcode to change.  Once I moved the call to codeLoadPayeescode above the assignment to codeSelectedValuecode, everything works like a charm.  strongSee answer below.strongp

Negative 8109 pWe have a WPF software which makes use quite a lot of the async await pattern in order to not block the UI thread.  p  pFor instance, we use this pattern when opening a file The UI shows a spinner while in the background we do some IO loading operation and start tasks for long calculations which should not stop the loadingp  pWhat seems to happen is that my loading task is effectively launched on another thread, thus not blocking the UI. So that works. However, the loading task seems to run synchronously all the other tasks I create, such as long calculation which the loading does not need.p  pI pinpoint the debugger becausep  ul liI noticed that for big files, when the debugger is attached, the spinner runs longer for about 1020 times.  li liRunning release or debug version does not affect behavior.li liAs long as the debugger is attached, it is way slower.li liDetaching the debugger in the middle of the loading will run super fast right afterwards. li ul  pI know this only because when breaking with the debugger, I seep  ul liOn the current thread, the top of the call stack is my LoadProjectAsync, li liThat thread is currently in the code of the long calculations, which have been triggered by async void since we dont care about them immediately and thus shouldnt be run synchronouslyli liThe Tasks window in Visual Studio always show 1 Active task, and some other tasks which are always in the Complete status.

Then I want to add a property codefoocode to an element at 0,0.

Negative 8109 pConsidering a simple database containing a table codefoo name text, description textcode and a table codebar key text, otherinfo textcode which share a manytomany relationship codefoobar fooid, baridcode . p  pThe fact is, I want to obtain codefoocode rows when a codebar.keycode contains a strongpartial patternstrong for example codeacode or code1234code.

Negative 8109 pI cant wrap my head around this.p  pWhen the page loads, php echoes a table with hundreds of rows. I have a search box which triggers a script that makes some rows .hide and others .show depending on the search query and the innerHTML of the name td. If i modify some things, it sends an Ajax request to the server, and the server returns a new, updated table which is identical in structure to the one that was echoed when the page was loaded. Inside Ajax success I .htmlthe ajax responce goes here to where the table goes.p  pALL WORKING WELL....p  pAfter .htmlthe ajax responce goes here I trigger a script that checks if a search box has any value. If it does, repeat the .hide and .show script above. BUT THIS TIME THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.p  pThis does not work at all.p  precodeif target TD not maching a search query    tdElem.parent.hide  codepre  pthe tdElem elements return correct values. Console log shows perfectly what suposed to be hidden. And I strongcanstrong even hide tdElem itself But not the parent WHYp  pWhy after the ajax update and not beforep  pThe table has not changed except for some values in unrelated cells In fact, i use the same script to initially display the table, and to send it to Ajax. And I use the same script to showhide table rows.p  pI even use .promise.done in the ajax request. I even tried to simply echo the showhide script script AFTER the table echo trough the same script.  if you dont know what or why, at least tell me more ways to debug this.p

Negative 8109 pI made a lot of changes to a VC in Xcode so that it seemed to get corrupt.  Following a technique I used before, I renamed the problem .h and .m files, created empty files with the correct name and then carefully copied over the methods until I had two new files free of errors.  I then cleaned the project and tried to rebuild however it failed and the error said that some images were being accessed by more than one file.p  pIn the past when I did this, I was able to delete the old project in the simulator by clicking hardware home and holding down.  This time, however, since the simulator wont start up, I am not sure what to do.p  pRight now when I try to run, I get lots of errors that sayScene is unreachable due to lack of entry points.p  pAlso in the list of files, several image files are now in red and when you click on the do not display.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestions on what to do now.p

Negative 8109 pIm trying to do something really simple and Im having a bit of trouble getting it to work. Im working with the MPL3115A2 AltitudePressure Sensor and a pic32 uC32 board, and Im trying to communicate between the two using I2C. uC32 board is similar enough to arduino that its practically the same in terms of coding.p  pIm using the wire library and Im simply trying to read register 0x0C from the MPL3115A2, which should give me the device ID.p  pHeres a code snippet the define is at the top of the code and the rest is in the main loopp  precodedefine barAddress 0x60  Wire.beginTransmissionbarAddress Wire.send0x0C Wire.endTransmission  Wire.requestFrombarAddress, 1 uint8t a  Wire.receive Serial.printlna, HEX codepre  pSo I start the transmission with address 0x60 From the datasheet The standard 7bit I2C slave address is 0x60 or 1100000. 8bit read is 0xC1, 8bit write is 0xC0.. Then I send 0x0C because thats the register I want to access. I then end transmission, and request 1 byte from address 0x60, receive that bit into a 8bit variable, then print it. p  pThe problem I run into is that when I print it, I just get 0. I dont get the device ID, just 0. No matter what register I try to read, I get 0.p  pIve been banging my head against a wall for the past few days trying to get this to work. Ive attached something Ive captured with a logic analyzer, as well as a list of registers from the datasheet of the MPL3115A2 that Ive been trying to access.p  pUsing a logic analyzer I can see the clock and data lines. The clock seems normal and the data line gives me the followingp  precodeSTART Write[192]  ACK 12  ACK STOP START Read[193]  ACK 0  NAK STOP codepre  pThis all seems correct to me 192 and 193 come from 8bit write and read being 0xC0 and 0xC1, except for the 0. I should be getting the device ID, not 0.p  pThanks for any help with thisp

Negative 8109 pIve started studying Unity and decided to do some practice. So, I thought that it would be awesome to develope Flappy Bird as an experiment. But Ive faced with the problem.

But when I call codeOnCollisionEnter2Dcode method, it detects collision with a prefab, not with the trigger or pipes in it. Could you help me How do I detect collision with a child of a prefabp

Negative 8109 pI have been trying to hook into the WordPress registration action so that I can store the new users account info on my Parse.com User database. However, since I am using BuddyPress, the WP hook codeuserregistercode does not seem to work.p  pAfter doing research online, it seems like I am supposed to use the BP hook codebpcoresignupusercode, but that does not seem to be working, and all the info online on how it should be implemented are years old and may be outdated. Problematically, BuddyPress does not have a good Codex at all, so I am kind of stuck. Ive been at this for hours, but cannot figure it out.p  pThis is the function I created in an attempt to hook into the registration processp  precodeltphp  Saves the newly registered BP user account to the Parse DB. addactionbpcoresignupuser, saveNewParseUser, 10, 5  function saveNewParseUseruserId, userLogin, userPass, userEmail, userMeta  Commit new user data to an HTTP POST request to Parse. url  httpsapi.parse.com1users  postdata  array     wpUserId gt userId,     username gt userLogin,     password gt userPass,     email gt userEmail,     fullName gt userMeta[displayname],     firstName gt userMeta[firstname],     lastName gt userMeta[lastname]  appID  a5TtlVG52JKTC restAPIKey  Qc86jA8dy1FpcB options  array options[]  Contenttype applicationjson options[]  XParseApplicationId appID options[]  XParseRESTAPIKey restAPIKey options[]  XParseRevocableSession 1  open connection ch  curliniturl  sets the number of POST vars amp POST data curlsetoptarraych, array     CURLOPTPOST gt true,     CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS gt jsonencodepostdata,     CURLOPTHTTPHEADER gt options,     CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER gt true   execute post result  curlexecch resultArray  jsondecoderesult, true  Error check if curlerrnoch      echo Error Code  . curlerrno .   . curlerrorch   Retrieve and place Parse user session token amp ID into WP DB user account. addusermetauserId, parseSessionToken, resultArray[sessionToken] addusermetauserId, parseObjId, resultArray[objectId] curlclosech  codepre  pWhat am I doing wrong Is this not even being hooked and run as it is meant to p  pI know it does not work because I check the Parse User DB after registering an account and a new row is not created, and the meta info I put into the WP account do not show there at all.p  pInterestingly, this DID work when I hooked into WPs codeuserregistercode with the appropriate parameter and codepostdatacode array setup when I included an codeexitcode call at the end of the function, which essentially prevented the registration process from going through BuddyPress and its activation procedure, and instead went straight to registering through Wordpress directly. That also left the web page displaying the output response from the HTTP request  it was the JSON response body as expected from Parse, so I know it did in fact work. Why would it be working when avoiding BuddyPress BuddyPress seems to be causing the problem here. If you would like to see the code for what I had done differently for this, then I can post it.p  pThank you for any assistance.p

I am wondering if anyone knows of a faster way to combine the data.  p  pI compare two sheets with roughly 700 and 400 rows, respectively.

Some lifts stay onboard for multiple legs.  The empty legs are not shown.p  pI need to combine the two so that the passenger and cargo information from Sheet 2 is added to the correct leg of the mission on Sheet 1.

Negative 8109 pBeen working in Java with images from the web encoded as base64 strings.

I have looked on SO and read a little on base 64 encoding.p  pFurthermore, I strip off the codedataimagepngbase64code part in Java Android when doing  codeBase64.decodesrc, Base64.DEFAULTcode so it looks like there is no need for the png in that situation. In fact if I do not strip off this header then  codeBitmapFactory.decodeByteArraycode returns null.p  pSo the question is, are there other formats other than png for image encoding on the webp
