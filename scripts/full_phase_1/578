Positive 578 pWhen calling a recursive function with kwargs multiple times, previous values of the kwargs are retained even though they are local variables. p  pThe following code snippet demonstrates the problem. p  precodeusrbinenv python  def countfunccount, messagelist[]     count  1     if count gt 0         messagelist.appendcount         countfunccount, messagelistmessagelist     else         print messagelist         del messagelist         returncount  if name  main     printCall 1     countfunc5     printCall 2     countfunc5     printCall 3     countfunc5     printCall 4     countfunc5 codepre  pThe output is p  pCall 1 [4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 2 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 3 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 4 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1]p  pI would expect the output for all for calls to bep  p[4, 3, 2, 1]p  pI call countfunc 4 times, each passing no kwargs. The function definition is set to provide an empty list as a default for messagelist if the kwarg is omitted. However, messagelist seems to retain its previous value across all 4 calls of countfunc.  p  pI would expect that local variables in prior calls of countfunc should not influence local variables in subsequent calls. p  pI suspect this has to do with the way Python handles recursion. Passing in an empty list each time I call the function gives the desired result, so I already have a work around.  I would like to understand why this is happening.  Does anyone have insightp
Positive 578 pMy Neo4j database contains relationships that may have a special propertyp  pcodea [sustainstrue]gt bcodep  pThis means that codeacode emsustainsem codebcode when the last node that sustains codebcode is deleted, codebcode itself should be deleted.

This is not a good programming technique. Modify the quicksort method to count comparisons by passing a parameter. This is a little trickier as the comparisons are done in the partition method. You should be able to see that the number of comparisons can be determined before the call to the partition method. You will need to return this value from the Quicksort method and modify the quickSort header to pass this value into each recursive call. You will need to add the counts recursively. As an alternative to the recursive counting, you can leave the code as is and complete the lab without the modification.p  pThe way I have been looking at this assignment I made a variable in the partition method called qSCount which when it is called will count how many comparisons were made. However I cant use that variable because I am not returning it. And Im not sure how I would use recursion in that state. My idea was after each time qSCount had a value I could somehow store it in doQuickSort method under qSTotal. But then again the hint is saying I need to make a parameter in quicksort so I am all sorts of confused. I would really appreciate some help on how I should do this.  p

Positive 578 pSo Im just starting to learn about recursion and Im confused as to how avoid this problem.  I will write a function that needs to store a variable, like a sum, but I have to declare the variable in the function so every time the recursive call is made the variable gets initialized again.  How can I fix this I think a helper function of some short but Im not really sure. p
Negative 578 pI am currently working on a web application, where I want the content to fill the height of the entire screen.p  pThe page has a header, which contains a logo, and account information.

Putting codeheadercode inside codecontentcode will not allow this to work.p  pIs there a way to achieve the same effect without using the codetablecodep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pElements inside the content codedivcode will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100 inside the codedivcode will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pFor instance, if the header takes up 20 of the screens height, a table specified at 50 inside codecontentcode would take up 40 of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.p

Negative 578 pIve been trying to migrate a fairly large web application from IIS6 to IIS7 the past few days, but every time it seems like were about done, IIS7 fails to load aspx pages.p  pThe application is a .net 3.5 webapp that makes heavy use of reflection and web services. We use 2 main components each with their own web site in IIS7 although they share an application pool the web UI aspx pages, and the webAPI asmx pages.p  pThe webAPI portion runs perfectly as far as we can tell there are a few things we cant test from the browser, and the web UI pages load static HTM pages just fine. The problem is that once we attempt to view an aspx page any aspx page, the whole thing just comes to a halt no error is logged in the event viewer until a few minutes later when we get an IIS 5010 warning worker process ignoring ping.p  pWeve attempted to migrate the app in two different waysp  ol liManually we moved all the necessary files and set up the virtual directories then converted them to Web Sites.

We had to turn off Forms Auth to get rid of a 401.2 error, but after that the result here was that the webAPI component still works just fine, but instead of the web UI worker process taking up 100 of a single core, it grew to about a third of the required memory then hung out doing nothing.li ol  pEither way, what happened from the users point of view was the same.p  pUnfortunately, we cant even attach a debugger to the worker process because it doesnt seem to be loading managed code.p  pDetailsp  ul li.net framework v3.5li liCLR version v2.0li liIIS Authorization mode Anonymousli liOS arch x64li liApp arch x86li liHappens with both classic and integrated pipelinesli ul  pNotesp  ul liNew web projects seem to work just fine in IIS7 and, of course, xml web services are also fineli litemporary DLLs emareem created and stored in the temporary ASP.net DLLs folder, even though the worker process never seems to contain managed code.li liNew pages added to the web UI project also show the same behavior Didnt hurt to tryli ul  pUpdatesp  ul liWeve narrowed down the problem to a single assembly.

Negative 578 pWhile many ask questions about where to find good books or tutorials, Id like to take the opposite tack.p  pI consider myself to be an entrylevel programmer ready to move up to midlevel. I have written code in c, c, c, perl, python, clojure, vb, and java, so Im not completely clueless.p  pWhere I see a problem in moving to the next level is learning to make better use of the literally hundreds upon hundreds of libraries available out there.p  pI seem paralyzed unless there is a specific example in a book or tutorial to handhold me, yet I often read in various forums where another programmer attempts to assist with a question. Heshe will look through the docs or scan the available classesmethods in their favorite IDE and seem to grok whats going on in a relatively short period of time, even if they had no previous experience with that specific library or function. p  pI yearn to break the umbilical chord of constantly spending hour upon hour searching and reading, searching and reading, searching and reading. Many times there is no book or tutorial, or if there is, the discussion glosses over my specific needs or the examples shown are too far off the path for the usage I had in mind or the information is outdated and makes use of deprecated components or the library itself has fallen out of mainstream, yet is still perfectly usable but no docs, books, or tutorials to handhold.p  pstrongMy question is In the absence of books or tutorials, what is the best way to grok new or unfamiliar librariesstrong p  pI yearn to slicken the grok path so I can get down to the business of doing what I love most  coding.p

Negative 578 pI am using Oracle 10g and the following paradigm to get a page of 15 results as a time so that when the user is looking at page 2 of a search result, they see records 1630. p  precodeselect     from   select rownum rnum, a.     from myquery a    where rownum lt 30  where rnum gt 15 codepre  pRight now Im having to run a separate SQL statement to do a select count on myquery in order to get the total number of results for myquery so that I can show it to the user and use it to figure out total number of pages, etc. p  pIs there any way to get the total number of results without doing this via a second query, i.e. by getting it from above query Ive tried adding maxrownum, but it doesnt seem to work I get an error [ORA01747] that seems to indicate it doesnt like me having the keyword rownum in the group by. p  pMy rationale for wanting to get this from the original query rather than doing it in a separate SQL statement is that myquery is an expensive query so Id rather not run it twice once to get the count, and once to get the page of data if I dont have to but whatever solution I can come up with to get the number of results from within a single query and at the same time get the page of data I need should not add much if any additional overhead, if possible. Please advise.p  pHere is exactly what Im trying to do for which I receive an ORA01747 error because I believe it doesnt like me having ROWNUM in the group by. Note, If there is another solution that doesnt use maxROWNUM, but something else, that is perfectly fine too. This solution was my first thought as to what might work. p  precode SELECT  FROM SELECT r., ROWNUM RNUM, maxROWNUM  FROM SELECT t0.ABCSEQID AS c0, t0.FIRSTNAME, t0.LASTNAME, t1.SCORE  FROM ABC t0, XYZ t1  WHERE t0.XYZID  751 AND   t0.XYZID  t1.XYZID   ORDER BY t0.RANK ASC r WHERE ROWNUM lt 30 GROUP BY r., ROWNUM WHERE RNUM gt 15 codepre  p EDIT  Note, based on the first comment I tried the following that appears to work. I dont know how well it performs versus other solutions though Im looking for the solution that fufills my requirement but performs the best. For example, when I run this it takes 16 seconds. When I take out the COUNT OVER  RESULTCOUNT it takes just 7 seconds p  precode    SELECT  FROM SELECT r., ROWNUM RNUM,       FROM SELECT COUNT OVER  RESULTCOUNT,            t0.ABCSEQID AS c0, t0.FIRSTNAME, t1.SCORE      FROM ABC t0, XYZ t1      WHERE t0.XYZID  751 AND t0.XYZID  t1.XYZID      ORDER BY t0.RANK ASC r WHERE ROWNUM lt 30 WHERE RNUM gt 1 codepre  pThe explain plan changes from doing a SORT ORDER BY STOP KEY to do a WINDOW SORT.p  pBeforep  precodeSELECT STATEMENT    COUNT STOPKEY       VIEW        SORT ORDER BY STOPKEY       NESTED LOOPS        TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID  XYZ       INDEX UNIQUE SCAN   XYZID      TABLE ACCESS FULL    ABC codepre  pAfterp  precodeSELECT STATEMENT    COUNT STOPKEY       VIEW        WINDOW SORT         NESTED LOOPS        TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID  XYZ       INDEX UNIQUE SCAN   XYZID      TABLE ACCESS FULL    ABC codepre

Negative 578 pIm developing on an application at the moment which contains quite a lot of personal user information  things like Facebook contacts, etc ... Now, one of the things I want to be able to do and have done, quite effectively is open up parts of the application to 3rd Party applications, using Androids buildin interprocess communication protocol AIDL. So far so good.p  pHeres the catch because were involved in handling quite a lot of personal information, we have to be quite careful about who can and cant access it specifically, only Trusted applications should be able to do so. So the natural way to do this is to use a custom permission within the AndroidManifest.xml file where we declare the services. My problem is this I want to be able to enact signaturelevel protection similar to the normal signature permission level, but with a bit of a catchp  pI dont emonlyem want application signed with our internal signature to be able to access the services. Id like to be able to build a list of trusted signatures amp at runtime or if theres a better way, then maybe some other time be able to check incoming requests against this list of trusted keys.p  pThis would satisfy the security constraints in the same way as the normal signature permission level I think  only programs on the trusted keys list would be able to access the services, and keys are hard to spoof if possible at all  but with the added bonus that we wouldnt have to sign every application making use of the APIs with our internal teams key.p  pIs this possible at the moment in Android And if so, are there any special requirementsp  pThanksp

Negative 578 pFirst of all, sorry to post a question like this when so many other have been asked on this topic, but Ive been reading all the questions I could find google, and none has really given me any hints as to what is happening in my case.p  pI have a 3rd party .dll libFLAC with two exported functions with similar namep  precodeFLACStreamEncoderInitStatus FLACstreamencoderinitfile FLACStreamEncoder encoder, const char filename, FLACStreamEncoderProgressCallback progresscallback, void clientdata  FLACStreamEncoderInitStatus FLACstreamencoderinitFILE FLACStreamEncoder encoder, FILE file, FLACStreamEncoderProgressCallback progresscallback, void clientdata codepre  pThe purpose of the first one is to initialize an encoder with a filename. It calls fopen which on windows with unicode filenames is not a good thing in some cases. Thats why the developer provides the second function, which can be passed an open FILE in wb mode which im opening with a call to MSVCRT.DLL wfopensp  pI have defined my PInvoke declarations as followsp  pre[DllImportGlobals.LIBFLACDLL, EntryPoint  FLACstreamencoderinitfile, CharSet  CharSet.Ansi] public static extern InitStatus InitFilenameAnsiIntPtr Encoder, string Filename, ProgressDelegate ProgressCallback, ref Object ClientData  [DllImportGlobals.LIBFLACDLL, EntryPoint  FLACstreamencoderinitFILE] public static extern InitStatus InitFileHandleIntPtr Encoder, IntPtr FileHandle, ProgressDelegate ProgressCallback, ref Object ClientData pre  pThe strange problem is that the call to the file function lowercase works great, while the one that takes a FILE IntPtr doesnt work It throws the AccessViolationException.p  pI am passing exactly the same 1st, 3rd and 4th parameters to both, so Im pretty sure the problem is the IntPtr FileHandle parameter 3rd and 4th are null and can be null as per the docs. Providing real values doesnt help either. I am also sure the actual file handle is ok I am using the exact same code to wfopens in another project and its working perfectly. The file is also created before the crash, so its not a problem with that either.p  pEDIT The return value is just a public enum InitStatus int.p  pFor a moment, i thought that there could be a problem with the functions having almost the same name, so I tried calling them by ordinal, but it didnt work eitherp  precode[DllImportGlobals.LIBFLACDLL, EntryPoint  259, CharSet  CharSet.Ansi] FLACstreamencoderinitfile OK  [DllImportGlobals.LIBFLACDLL, EntryPoint  258] FLACstreamencoderinitFILE FAILS codepre  pI also thought that maybe the DLL I was using could have some sort of problem, so I switched it for a version compiled by another 3rd party 150K bigger in size, but I get exactly the same problem.p  pThe code Im using to callp  precode[TestMethod] public void ThisFailsMiserably      Object ClientData  null     IntPtr FileHandle  IntPtr.Zero      try              FILE.Openout FileHandle, test.flac, wb         Assert.AreNotEqualIntPtr.Zero, FileHandle Works great the file is created, and the debugger shows the file handle value.

Negative 578 pIve noticed whilst optimising animations for use on iPad using hardware acceleration, I seem to be coming across an issue that I havent fully been able to resolve. If you are applying webkit transforms such as translate, although the animation runs great, if in the middle of an animation occuring the user scrolls the page, when they release it causes the animation to stutter whereby it reverts to its original position and attempts to continue its animation to its end point.p  pIve been looking everywhere for resolve on this issue, having seen it occur on the iPad store as well If you have an iPad at hand and you navigate to, for example a hrefhttpwebkit.orgdemostransitionsandtransforms relnofollowhttpwebkit.orgdemostransitionsandtransformsa , if you select an item then before the button animation has completed drag the pagescroll then release it, you will see the animation flicker back to its original position and then repeat until its complete.p  pThe only way Ive been able to work around this is when a touchmove event occurs, I tell the animation to just stay where at its original location, which stops it from trying to repeat the transition on release, as even attempts to just tell it where to go again cause it to revert regardless seeing as how css transitions seem not technically able to be stopped.p  pHas anyone found any workarounds to this issue, Im pretty sure this is a bug on iPad as opposed to a problem with the animation this does not involve issues regarding preserve3d and what have you, or if I should be reporting this as an issue.p  pThanksp

Negative 578 pI have an Access 2003 database with a query that is a left outer join of a table to another query. If I didnt sort that final query, I got 42 records.

Negative 578 h2The questionh2  pIm overriding the GWT codeTextInputCell.onBrowserEventcode method to try and apply filtering on the characters that are typed in to the field. How can I cant get the actual character that the user typed in on a codekeydowncode eventp  h2What Ive triedh2  pI can use the codeNativeEvent.getKeyCodecode method to get the key code, but this is insufficient because I want to know the specific character they typed in, so I can compare the character to a regular express. As I understand it, the keyCode just tells me the key they typed on the keyboard, so I cant discriminate between a capital A and a lowercase a. I can also grab the value from the codeInputElementcode on the codekeyupcode event, but this is too late, because the character has already been rendered to the UI element.p  pWhen I call codeNativeEvent.getCharCodecode it returns 0 for any character I type. I tried this on Chrome and on Firefox. Why does codegetCharCodecode always return 0 Is this a bug p  pFor example, here is what I tried and the values I get when I type in the number 1 on the keyboardp  precodeevent.getKeyCode  49 event.getCharCode  0 Character.toCharsevent.getCharCode[0]  a box character because charCode was 0 String.valueOfCharacter.toCharsevent.getCharCode  a box character because charCode was 0 String.valueOfchar event.getKeyCode  1 codepre  h2Updateh2  pOK, so I see that I need to capture the codekeypresscode event and not codekeydowncode, but I print off every codeevent.getTypecode value for every event that occurs as I type and I never see a single codekeypresscode event triggered. So my updated question is, why isnt the codekeypresscode event occurring And if I cant capture it in the codeTextInputCell.onBrowserEventcode method, is there a different way to capture it for a codeTextInputCellcode. p

Negative 578 pFor the last years I used Notepad on Win XP SP2. As I just have seen, the setting in Notepad is to encode new files in ANSI in Windows Format. Basically all files on my harddisk should be ANSI files then, but Im not sure. Most .htmlfiles have a charsettag as texthtml charsetiso88591, but some have none. Other files, especially textfiles for example keywordlists I stored with Firefox XPCOMsystem, I dont know how they are currently encoded.p  pOn Serverside I have Apache with PHP and MySql. For Upload I used Filezilla.p  pNow the problem is I want to use Japanes signs or arabic, etc.. This only works partly. I can get my selfmade FirefoxApplication to constantly write or read UTF8. But I cant check everytime which of the old files is which encoding.p  pHaving just read Joel Spolskys old article about UTF8 strengthens my view that I simply have to get my whole system changed as much as possible to UTF8. As long as I have it running that way locally on my HardDisk I could just reupload everything to the server.p  pSo How do I get all my files locally transfered to UTF8  And Is it possible at all to have Win XP SP2 using constantly UTF8 everywhere Or do I have to check it with every program, or even worse with every file, that the right encoding is to be used. How about files I get for example in EMails or via an USBstick, or that I download in zipfiles Or a thousand possibilities more.p  h3Updateh3  p1.4. went OK so far. I tried first with BOM, but without seems to be better.br So to 5. Something I have to change there too. I changed as in 3. the charset in the htmltemplatefile, and the text coming from the template is displayed correctly. But the text coming from MySqlPhp shows the UnknownCharsign at some places currently, i.e. where there should be Umlaute . I have changed all collations for text fields in the MySqlDatabase via phpmyadmin to utf8unicodeci, but that didnt do the trick. Is it a phpissue, or do I only have to convert somehow the data in the MySqlDatabase oncep

Negative 578 pI have a code that is leaking on Windows. It runs fine on many unix platforms and the leak only occurs on Windows. The binary consists of exe, 1 dll and 2 static libs. The exe links to both the dll and the static libs, while the static libs link with the dll as well. The leak occurs in the exe code when instead of calling to a vector deleting destructor, for some reason scalar deleting destructor is called. This results in only the first object in the array to be deleted while the rest of the array stays in memory.p  pThe leaking pseudocode looks like thisp  precodeclass MyClassFromExe  public MyBaseClassFromDll    public     ClassFromDll marr      MyClassFromExeunsigned int size              marr  new ClassFromDll[size]           MyClassFromExe             delete [] marr        void func    MyClassFromExe obj3  codepre  pWhen func finishes and the destructor is called I see that only the destructor of the first object in marr is called. From debugger I see that this is done from scalar deleting destructor and not from vector deleting destructor. This explains why only the first object is destroyed. What I need to understand is why scalar deleting destructor is called when delete [] is usedp  pI found this thread  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3373193whyisvectordeletingdestructorbeingcalledasaresultofascalardeleteWhy is vector deleting destructor being called as a result of a scalar deletea. I followed the suggestions there and made sure that all the modules are compiled with MD.p  pImportant to notice that when the dll that contains ClassFromDll was a static library and not a dll, everything worked fine. The leak started only when the static library was changed to be a dll. While the program leaks in Release mode, it crashes in Debug mode on delete [] marr. The crash occurs in dbgdel.cpp line 52  BLOCKTYPEISVALIDpHeadnBlockUse.p  pOn unix platforms this lib is also a shared lib and as expected vector deleting destructor is called there and there is no leak. Could the problem be with the VC compiler Or maybe some other settings of the projects need to be changed Im using VC2003.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 578 pI have recently made a custom template for my Wordpress powered site but when ever I copy a link from one of the post pages onto the Facebook wall it no longer posts the feature image with it.

Negative 578 pI am looking for athe best way to make lookup tables or use codes in a relational database made from Pythons Elixir. I am not even sure my terminology here is correct.p  pFor example, I have a Location table that has a Region column.  I want the values for the Region column to only have values of North America, Central America, South America, AsiaPacific Islands, and several others.  The list of values might change in the future.p  pHow can this be done with Elixir  Using an Enum seems like a bad idea because the values are long text strings.  It seems that some kind of code would be better like 1North America, 2South America, etc.  How do I store and reference these codes in the database  p

Negative 578 pBackstory  To specify the correct route for a jqGrid that I show on my ASP.NET MVC 3 page, I do something like sop  precodejqgFlavors.jqGrid    url Url.ActionFlavorData, IceCream, etc... codepre  pand that will produce the correct route either when running locally out of Visual Studio where things live at something like codehttplocalhost90125IceCreamcode  or on the deployed site where things live at something like codehttpthehostsitemydeployedsitenameIceCreamcode.p  pGreat.  Now the issue Im having is that I use the codeonSelectRowcode in the grid to do a masterdetails thing based on the selected rows flavor id value.  First, I tried doing this to just get the route correctp  precodeonSelectRow functiontheRow    flavorDetails.loadUrl.ActionDetails,IceCream, new id  42  codepre  pSo that I can pass the value 42 in as the id parameter in the codeDetailscode action of the codeIceCreamcode controller. And that works fine, but of course I dont want to hard code the value 42, rather pull the flavor id from the grid itself.  So I have tried to reference the flavorID  but cant seem to get the syntax correctp  precodeonSelectRow functiontheRow    var grid  jQueryjqgFlavors    var flavorID  grid.jqGridgetCell, theRow, FlavorID    flavorDetails.loadUrl.ActionDetails,IceCream, new id  flavorID  codepre  pIm sure you get what Im going for here  referencing the flavorID value I extract from the grid.  But what I get is a compilation errorp  pstrongThe name flavorID does not exist in the current context.strongp  pI suspect this is really simple.  How do I reference correctly that variablep

Negative 578 pIn Serialization, the class which we want to be serialized has to implement the Serializable interface, otherwise a NotSerializableException is thrown. There are many other examples like that in the various features of Java. Now I just want to know how to bring in such control in custom classes and interfaces. I have an interface called Agent. There can be many different types of Agents, all of them must implement the Agent interface. I also have a class called Node. Nodes create Agents. Now how to bring in control in such a situation, such that an agent always much implement Agent interface, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

Negative 578 pThe problem is Im trying to find a single method to save an entity, be it a new entity or an already loaded entity. Most all code samples separate Add and Save methods which goes against so many other current designs of having a single Save method.p  pLet me state Ive read the other posts. Ive looked at the team blog on repository pattern as well which has a single AddObject method that I cant seem to find by assuming it just is an Addobject. p  pIf we load an object and save it, the context knows about it.  A new object we MUST add.  If we add an existing object  it will send it over as an insert.p  pI want one save procedure here. A user shouldnt have to know to call Add or Update, a Save should suffice.  With that said, whats the best route here for a single save solution that covers in the same method only the save, not the load 1. loading an entity, saving back to the db. 2. Creating a new entity, saving it to the db. So Im looking for an implementation that in all cases can just bep  precodeICustomerRepository.SaveCustomer customercodepre  pWhat solution would you be using that worksp  pThe following code in a Saveentity method seems to work for mep  precode If the primary key is empty, its a new record if order.OrderId  0     context.Orders.Addorder   if context.Entryorder.State  System.Data.EntityState.Detached     Need to set modified so any detached entities are updated otherwise they wont be sent across to the db. Since it wouldve been outside the context, change tracking wouldnt have occurred anyways so we have no idea about its state  save it    context.Orders.Attachorder    context.Entryorder.State  System.Data.EntityState.Modified    codepre  pThe issue here though is with a Generic Repository implementation there is no clear way here without querying what the key is and checking its value then via reflection which isnt clean.p

Negative 578 pI just spent most of a day tracking down a very strange case where calling resignFirstResponder on the active UITextField did not hide the keyboard, even though the textfield was the first responder. This happens when I push a view controller on top of another view controller with an active text field. The keyboard goes away as expected. But if I bring the keyboard back by touching a textfield in the 2nd view controller, subsequent calls to resignFirstResponder have no effect.   p  pHeres simple code to reproduce the issue. This code is a view controller with a nav bar button to hide the keyboard, and another to push another copy of itself with a confirmation UIAlertView. The first copy works without problem. However, if you push a 2nd copy when the first copy has a visible keyboard it is impossible to dismiss the keyboard. This only happens if there is a UIAlertView the confirmation on the screen when the 2nd copy is pushed. If you remove the codedefine ALERTcode line, everything works. p  pDoes anyone know what is happening here It looks like the UIALertView window is somehow interfering with the keyboard and keeping its window from disappearing, which then confuses the next view. Is there any solution here other than pushing the 2nd view controller on a timer after the UIALertView is gonep  pSorry for the complex description. This is runnable code.

Negative 578 pIve setup a viewbased NSTableView using bindings and everything is working accordingly. However, Im having issues when it comes to empty selections. Ive bound my NSTableViews Content and SelectionIndexes to an NSArrayController and ensured that both the NSTableView and the NSArrayController allow empty selections. In fact, I know this to be true because when I manually pass an empty NSIndexSet to my NSArrayControllers setSelectionIndexes method my NSTableView correctly deselects all of its rows.p  pThe issue Im having is getting my NSTableView to deselect when the user clicks the empy space beneath the NSTableViews populated rows. Im fairly certain this is default behaviour, but I cant for the life of me find a way to make my NSTableView behave this way.p

Negative 578 pIm developing a first iPhone app for iOS 4.x5.0 and have some confusions on how to comply with the recommended Apple guidelines. I have also attached code snippet.p  pHere is the scenariop  pWhen the app loads, I want to show the following functionalities in the bottom of the screen Test, Settings. My first question is do I have to go with a UISegmentedControl or UITabBar The trickiest part is I dont want the first Test tabbutton to be selected automatically. I want the user to select the tabbutton. Until that happens,  I want a timer that runs showing some text. I tried to use a UITabBar and when the app loads, the first Test tab is selected and the associated ViewController is shown by default. I circumvented this by pushing a root view controller in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method in the AppDelegate.m. This works and when I click on the Scores tab, it pops the root view controller and pushes the test view controller. But if I select the Settings tab immediately after the app loads and click on the Test tab, the view controller for the Test tab is not loading at all, but the main view controller is still displayed. I also have a UINavigationController in place on the Test tab and I hide it in the viewDidAppear event. I also want to eliminate the animation pushing back when I click on the Test tab.p  pMy confusions arep  ol lipCan I replace the UINavigationController with some other control to let the user click on a StartStop button displayed on the top when in the test view controller.pli lipIs there a click event on the tabs in the UITabBar for each of the tabspli lipI wanted to do everything from code except adding controls to ViewControllers.

Negative 578 pIm using PHPMailer for a while now and never really had any problems, but last week I installed one of my CMS on a website and the client insisted on having 2 emails receiving the contents of the contact form of his website.p  pOk, no problem I thought, just adding an email address using the phpmailerAddAddress function. However, adding a second receiver is causing PHPMailer to send the mail twice to both receivers. I tried adding a third receiver to see if I got it three times, but this didnt change anything. So adding 2 receivers is causing PHPMailer to send the message twice to all receivers.p  pTheres nothing strange in my code. Its a basic PHPMailer examplep  precodemail              new PHPMailer mailgtAddReplyTonameyourdomain.com,First Last mailgtSetFromnameyourdomain.com, First Last  mailgtAddAddressinfoaddress.com mailgtAddAddressinfoaddress.nl mailgtSubject     PHPMailer Test Subject via mail, basic   mailgtSend codepre  pIve ran out of options. I have absolutely no clue where its going wrong.p  pThanks in advancep  pp  pJust some random thought I noticed the mailer is defaulted by iso88591 and my site is running utf8. Can there be a silent redirect by the server itselfp  pEDIT, that  solved my problemp  pEDIT2p  pOk, it did not.. today the script worked fine just 1 mail with 2 receivers but a moment ago the strange behavior started again. Any tipsp  p Solutionp  pok, I feel quiet stupid The answer Zulkhaery Basrul came closest to the actual problem This is what happened I was sending an email to multiple addresses in the to field. For examplep  pTo A, B, Cp  pBoth AB are my own adresses. In outlook I had some message rules to put emails with certain addressees inside a specific folder. Both A and B had this rule.p  pWhen I recieved my email, both mails contained both mailaddresses in the tofield. Causing both of the mails to meet the rule requirements for both rules. Thus keeping the original in one folder and creating a copy in the other twice.p  pThanks for thinking tho p

Negative 578 pI am currently developing a web application that is right now comprised of a front end which displays and interacts with the data using a REST API we have written.  The only thing that will ever use the API is our front end website, and at some point a mobile app that we will develop.p  pI have done a lot of reading about how OAuth is the ideal mechanism for securing an API and at this point I am starting to have a good understanding of how it works.  p  pMy question is  since I am never granting access to my API to a thirdparty client, is OAuth really necessary  Is there any reason it is advantageous   Furthermore, because the back end is simply the API, there is no gateway for a user to authenticate from like if you were writing an app using the Twitter API, when a user authenticates they would be directed to the Twitter page to grant to access then redirected back to the client. p  pI am not really sure which direction to go in.  It seems like there must be some approach halfway between http authentication and OAuth that would be appropriate for this situation but Im just not getting it.p

Once the key is known and the digest is known, is it possible to get the plaintext back preimage attack without bruteforce a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPreimageattack relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPreimageattackap  pMy intuition says NO as the block size input size is 512 bit and the output size is 256 bit.

This is the exact opposite to the requirement of a block cipher where the function should be invertible one to one.p  pAs far as I understood the requirement is to have random manytoone functionp

This is great and all, but the server app requires multiple external services such as redis and memcached, both of which require separate ports.

Negative 578 pIm trying to build a system working with ADFS and claims. At the moment, this is just a toy implementation.p  pIve built a very simple MVC web application, set it up using the Identity and Access... wizard in Visual Studio to talk to an ADFS 2.0 server, and deployed it to an IIS server. All works fine, and I can examine and list the received claims.p  pThe next step is to build a Web API based REST service representing backend services that the MVC application is going to depend on, so I want to pass the credentials across to that backend server so that it can make suitable authorization decisions.p  pSo the first step is for me to create the delegation token and Ill then, hopefully, work out what to do with it in terms of the codeHttpClientcode class to make the rest call. Ive got thisp    precodeWe need to take the bootstrap token and create an appropriate ActAs token var rst  new RequestSecurityToken      AppliesTo  new EndpointReferencehttpsotheriis.example.comRest,     RequestType  RequestTypes.Issue,     KeyType  KeyTypes.Symmetric,     ActAs  new SecurityTokenElementBootstrapContextClaimsIdentityUser.Identity.BootstrapContext.SecurityToken   var sts  new SecurityTokenService This line isnt valid var resp  sts.IssueSystem.Threading.Thread.CurrentPrincipal as ClaimsPrincipal, rst codepre  pBut, the issue is that codeSecurityTokenServicecode is abstract. I cant find any types derived from this class in either codeSystem.IdentityModelcode nor codeSystem.IdentityModel.Servicescode, and the above doesnt include any reference to the ADFS server which Ill obviously need to provide at some point.p  pOf course, I may be going down completely the wrong route also, or am just hitting a minor stumbling block and not seeing a much larger one looming in the distance, so any advice on that would be appreciated also.p  hr  pIve looked at, for example, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee517269.aspxIdentity Delegation Scenarioa, but that uses codeCreateChannelActingAscode, which I dont think is going to work when Im talking to a rest service or will it, and also doesnt seem to apply to .NET 4.5.p

I cant figure out how they are ordered. p  pFor example, given the two different way to create a sequential guid, how to determine which is the best other than speed For example it looks like both have the disadvantage that if their clock is set back 2 minutes e.g. timeserver update they sequences are suddenly broken But would that also mean trouble for the Sql sever index p  pI use this code to produce the sequential Guidp  precodepublic static Guid CombFromArticle     var randomBytes  Guid.NewGuid.ToByteArray    byte[] timestampBytes  BitConverter.GetBytesDateTime.Now.Ticks  10000L     if BitConverter.IsLittleEndian       Array.ReversetimestampBytes     var guidBytes  new byte[16]     Buffer.BlockCopyrandomBytes, 0, guidBytes, 0, 10    Buffer.BlockCopytimestampBytes, 2, guidBytes, 10, 6     return new GuidguidBytes   public static Guid CombFromNHibernate    var destinationArray  Guid.NewGuid.ToByteArray   var time  new DateTime0x76c, 1, 1   var now  DateTime.Now   var span  new TimeSpannow.Ticks  time.Ticks   var timeOfDay  now.TimeOfDay   var bytes  BitConverter.GetBytesspan.Days   var array  BitConverter.GetByteslongtimeOfDay.TotalMilliseconds  3.333333   Array.Reversebytes   Array.Reversearray   Array.Copybytes, bytes.Length  2, destinationArray, destinationArray.Length  6, 2   Array.Copyarray, array.Length  4, destinationArray, destinationArray.Length  4, 4   return new GuiddestinationArray  codepre  pThe one from the article is slightly faster but which creates the best sequence for SQL server I could populate 1 million records and compare the fragmentation but Im not even sure how to validate that properly. And in any case, Id like to understand how I could write a test case that ensures the sequences are sequences as defined by Sql serverp  pAlso Id like some comments on these two implementations. What makes one better than the other p
Negative 578 pSo I have been following a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles24656ADetailedDataBindingTutorial relnofollowthis guide for data binding on Windows Forms controlsa MAD props to the author, this guide is great, and I have used this to create a custom class and bind a codeDataGridViewcode to a collection of this classp  precodeclass CompleteJobListEntry      private string jobName     private Image jobStatus     private DateTime jobAddedDate     private string jobAddedScanner     private string jobAddedUser     private string jobLastActivity     private DateTime jobActivityDate     private string jobActivityUser      public string JobName  get  return jobName  set  this.jobName  value       public Image JobStatus  get  return jobStatus  set  this.jobStatus  value       public DateTime JobAddedDate  get  return jobAddedDate  set  this.jobAddedDate  value       public string JobAddedScanner  get  return jobAddedScanner  set  this.jobAddedScanner  value       public string JobAddedUser  get  return jobAddedUser  set  this.jobAddedUser  value       public string JobLastActivity  get  return jobLastActivity  set  this.jobLastActivity  value       public DateTime JobActivityDate  get  return jobActivityDate  set  this.jobActivityDate  value       public string JobActivityUser  get  return jobActivityUser  set  this.jobActivityUser  value    codepre  pAt this point, I import a bunch of data from various SQL databases to populate the table, and it turns out great. The guide even provides an excellent starting point for adding filters, which I intend to follow a bit later. For now, though, I am stuck on the sorting of my newly generated codeDataGridViewcode. Looking around, Ive discovered that the codeDataGridViewcode has its own Sort method, usable like  p  precodecompleteJobListGridView.SortcompleteJobListGridView.Columns[JobName], ListSortDirection.Ascending codepre  pHowever, when I try to do this, I get an codeInvalidOperationExceptioncode that tells me DataGridView control cannot be sorted if it is bound to an IBindingList that does not support sorting. Ive found both the IBindingList and IBindingListView interfaces, but making my class inherit either of these interfaces doesnt solve the problem.p  pHow do I do this I am completely stuck here...p

Negative 578 pIs there a text compression library for Erlang  When working with very long strings, it may be advantageous to compress the character data. Has anyone compressed text or thought of a way to do it in Erlangp  pI was thinking of using the codezipcode module, but instead of working with files, I work inmemory like thisp  precodecompressLargeTextgt     Binary  listtobinaryLargeText,     ok,,Zipped  zipzipZipName,[Name,Binary],[memory],     Zipped. codepre  pThen I would codeunzipcode the text back into memory when I need it. Like thisp  precodeok,[Name,Binary]  zipunzipZipped,[memory]. codepre  pMy Erlang application is supposed to be part of a middle tier in which large text may have to pass through to, and out of a storage system. The storage system is intended on storing large text. To optimize the storage, there is need to compress it before sending it. Assume that the text value is like a codeCLOBcode data type in Oracle Database. I am thinking that if I combine the zipping and the codeerlanggarbagecollect0code, i can pull it off.p  pOr if its not possible in Erlang, perhaps it is possible using a codesystem callcode via codeoscmdSome UNIX scriptcode and then I would grab the output in Erlang If theres a better way, please show it.p

Cause I redirect request from localhost to remote server AS IS so in request in field HOST I have localhost. It seems like some sites ignore this fields, other try to use and redirect to 404 page, cause cant find localhost Im asking for. So question is how to change field Host in request on destination server namep

Negative 578 pI was confusing myself a little with a thought experiment and now Im looking for some advice. Its about ECMAscript references and the codeArray.prototype.indexOfcode method.p  pLets start easyp  precodevar container  [ ]  more code container.push 5  container.push 7  container.push 10  codepre  hr  pSo now we pushed some emprimitive valuesem into our ECMAscript array whether or not that statement is true Ill come back for, at least I imagined it like this so far. A call top  precodecontainer.indexOf 7  codepre  pwill return code1code as expected. The big question Im having is, if code.indexOfcode really compares the primitive value or if in reality a codeNumbercode object is created  stored and its strongreferencestrong is getting compared. This becomes a little more obvious if we rewrite that like sop  precodevar a  5,     b  7,     c  10  var container  [ ]  container.push a  container.push b  container.push c   container.indexOf b  codepre  hr  pUntil this point, one could still easily argue that all code.indexOfcode needs to do is to compare values, but now lets look at something like thisp  precodevar a   name a, value 5 ,     b   name b, value 10 ,     c   name c, value 15   var container  [ ]  more code container.push a  container.push b  container.push c  codepre  pHere, we filled that container array with emobjectreferencesem and still, code.indexOfcode works as expectedp  precodecontainer.indexOf b    1 codepre  pwhile a call like thisp  precodecontainer.indexOf name b, value 10  codepre  pobviously returns code1code since we are creating a new object and get a new reference. So here it must internally compare references with each other, rightp  pCan some ECMAscript spec genius confirm that or even better link me some material about that p  pA side question on this would be if there is any possibly way to access an internally stored objectreference within a emlexicalEnvironmentem respectively emActivation Objectem.p

Negative 578 pWhen Mission Control runs, it prevents applications from receiving keyboard and mouse events. It also leaves the last application running thinking that it still has focus. This is a problem for me because I dont receive keyUp or mouseUp events if I start Mission Control with a mouse button or a key held down and my application will behave as if that mouse button or key is held down. p  pI would like a way to either read both keyboard and mouse events even when Mission Control is active, or a way of detecting that Mission Control is active. Ideally, I would like to be able to do the latter since I effectively cant use my application when Mission Control is running.p  pIve tried a couple of things with no luckp  ol liUse addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask to register a global monitor for keyboard and mouse events. This captures mouse events but not keyboard events, although the a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacDOCUMENTATIONCocoaReferenceApplicationKitClassesNSEventClassReferenceReference.htmlapplerefceconstNSLeftMouseUp relnofollowdocumentationa says keyDown events should be sent to the global monitor when I switch to another application, but Mission Control doesnt seem to let events propagate to global monitors.li liCheck code[[NSRunningApplication currentApplication] isActive, ownsMenuBar]code.

None of them are.li liCheck if Mission Control is one of the running applications returned by code[NSWorkspace runningApplications]code. Mission Control does not show up in this list when its running.li ol  pThanks in advancep  pEditp  pIve finally worked around this problem albeit not in a very satisfactory way. For the mouse, it turns out that you can query the state of the pressed buttons with code[NSEvent pressedMouseButtons]code. I simply keep track of what I think the mouse state should be from NSLeftMouseDown and NSLeftouseUp events and compare that to code[NSEvent pressedMouseButtons]code every so often to make sure that theyre consistent. If theyre not, then I know that something has hijacked my NSLeftouseUp event and act accordingly.p  pFor the keyboard, I could not find a way to query the keyboard state, so I couldnt do a similar workaround. I ended up disabling application switching using a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymactechnotesKioskModeIntroductionIntroduction.html relnofollowpresentation optionsa when keys are pressed.p

Negative 578 pI am trying to work out an example of recording audio, with the data storage being handled by the app, not codeMediaRecordercode.

Negative 578 pI still have some trouble wrapping my head around threads, and Im trying to do this in the simplest way possible. I know that threads all have to have a run method they inherited from the Runnable class, but they can have additional methods as well, correctp  pThe reason being, I have a thread with some private variables and a run method. It calls its run function, and once its done, I want to reuse the thread with the exact same run method. It does exactly the same thing, just with different variables. So can I add something like a setArray method the thread contains a private byte array so I can just simply call run again with this new array, or is that not allowed. I guess to put it simply, itd be something likep  precodeThread thread  new MyThread thread.start   Check if the thread has finished in a nonblocking way if thread.isAlive  false      thread.setArraynewArray     thread.start  codepre  pBasically I only have a fixed number of threads and when the first thread is done running, I want to change the parameters a bit and have it run again. I dont wan them to die, which seems to be what join does.p  pFor the specific problem, I have say 4 threads, that each are give a set size block of a larger byte array. Each thread compresses that array with a Deflater and passes their result to a manager object that handles the synchronization. Once the first thread as in the thread that got the first part of the array, not the first to finish is done, it moves on to the next block not assigned to a thread.p  pI know thread pools are an option, but it seems a bit overkill plus I really dont understand them Im still having trouble with just normal threads.p

Negative 578 pI have a website design that I want to integrate with a CMS. This is static htmlcss at the moment, but once it is finished there will be a small amount of dynamic content  menu, navigation, etc and creatingediting pages of course.p  pI want to keep my existing design, but use a CMS to update sections, add pages, etc.p  pAll of the big CMSs that I have investigated seem to be difficult to retrofit into an existing design and it looks like I would have to start from scratch to build my design with the CMS.p  pIs there a CMS that I can plug into my existing design  e.g. by adding server controls to the pages If not, how difficult is it to rebuild my design within a big CMS, such as Umbraco p  pI would welcome any feedback from others who have gone through this process, particularly with CMS recommendations.p
Negative 578 pIm not sure of the terminology for this kind of code, but I want to know if its possible to instantiate variables after the parentheses, but whilst using reflection.p  pI have a map which gets loaded from an XML file. This is a collection of int X, int Y, string S where the X,Y is the position of some terrain, and S is a string representing the type of the terrain. I have a dictionary to pass between the strings and the relevant types for example one keyvalue pair might be Tree, typeofTree.p  pWhen using reflection, although I know its possible to instantiate with parameters, the only way Im comfortable is just by using Activator.CreateInstanceType t, i.e. with an empty constructor.p  pWhen I had the maps hard coded, I would originally instantiate like this within some i,j for loopp  precodecase Tree  world.Add new Treei,j  codepre  pWhilst starting to think about reflection and my save file, I changed this top  precodeworld.Add new Tree  X  i, Y  j  codepre  pHowever, I realised that this wont work with reflection, so I am having to do the following Tree inherits from Terrain, and the dictionary just converts the XML save data string to a typep  precodeType type  dictionary[dataItem.typeAsString] Terrain t  TerrainActivator.CreateInstancetype t.X  i t.Y  j world.Addt codepre  pI would prefer to do this using something like p  precodeType type  dictionary[dataItem.typeAsString] world.AddTerrainActivator.CreateInstancetype  X  i, Y  j  codepre  pIs there any shortcut like this I guess if not I could edit world.Add to take an X and Y and cast to Terrain in there to access those variables, but I am still curious as to a what this var1  X, var2  Y programming is called, and b whether something similar exists when using reflection.p

Negative 578 pI already read all what is needed about missing notifications on usertouser app request, and it appears it could be p  ul libecause the app is not a canvas or the canvas url is not correctli libecause the app is in sandbox mode.li ul  pI developped my app in sandbox mode and tried some u2u requests between generated test users with JS SDK last weeks.

Negative 578 pI have a large Maven project which has several modules in it. When I want to run a JUnit test from one module I run mvn DtestNameOfTest test in the directory that contains all the modules.

Negative 578 pI have a Google Spreadsheet with 13 sheets.  Each sheet has the same formatting and layout but the data varies.  The ranges I need from each sheet are F7G13 and cell F2. Each row within the F7G13 range should be paired with Cell F2 and placed into 3 adjacent columns in another workbook well call it Workbook2.  So if there is a data point in column F there will be a data point in the adjacent G cell.  As long as there is data in the GF range then the contents of cell F2 needs to be copied over too.p  pSome potential problems...br The number of rows in the FG range will vary from 0 to 7 on any given sheet. Workbook2 has some autopopulated cells range F1J14 which will do some calculations based on information copied over.

Negative 578 pIm attempting to create an codeArrayListcode so java, obviously with type codeTileEntitycode yes this is a minecraft mod. But I also need the objects added to the codeArrayListcode to implement a certain interface. p  pThe first option that came to mind was creating an abstract subclass of codeTileEntitycode that implemented interface, and using that as the codeArrayListcode type. But given the fact that people normally create their own subclasses of codeTileEntitycode and use those as the class they normally subclass, and I want people to be able to hook into my mod, I cant expect them to subclass anything besides codeTileEntitycode. p  pMy current solution is to check codeifobject instanceof MyInterfacecode before adding, but that seems ugly. Surely theres a way to set the type of an codeArrayListcode to require that an object be both a subclass of codeTileEntitycode and an implementor of codeMyInterfacecode.p

Negative 578 pI have read a ton of articles on writing to the internal storage of an android device, and I need some help figuring out what I am doing wrong.

In that activity, I use this to call a function to write to internal storage like thisp  precodeWriteID uniqueID codepre  pWhere WriteID looks like thisp  precodevoid WriteIDstring uniqueID              using var o  new StreamWriter              OpenFileOutput FILENAME, FileCreationMode.Private             o.Write uniqueID      codepre  pThis is where it gets weird for me, if I put these two functions in the same activity, write to the file and then call the function to read from it, I get uniqueID returned correctly. However if I stop the app and then restart it, I get a File Not Found exception thrown and nothing returned from the read function. However, if I create a new project, and use the same code, everything works as expected file is created and written to, then on restart the data persists. p  pSo I am thinking there is some setting that I have changed or some reference that I may be missing in my original app that causes the internal storage file to be removed  when the app is stoppedp  pAny ideas as to why this works correctly in my test app, but not in the otherp

Negative 578 pi have recently discovered MonetDB and i am evaluating it for an internal project, so probably my questions are from a really newbie point of view. Maybe someone could point me to a site andor document where i could find more info i havent found too much googlingp  pregarding scalability, correct me please if i am wrong, but what i understand is that if i need to scale, i would launch more server instances and discover them from the control node, is it right is there any limit on the number of serversp  pthe other point is about storage, is it possible to use amazon S3 to back MonetDB readonly instancesp  pstrongupdatestrong we would need to store a massive amount of Call Detail Records from different sources, on a readonly basis. We would aggregatereduce that data for the daytoday operation, accessing the bigger tables only when the full detail is required.  We would store the historical data as well to perform longerterm analysis. My concern is mostly about memory, disk storage wouldnt be the issue i think if the hot dataset involved in a reportanalysis eats up the whole memory space fast response times needed, not sure about how memory swapping would impact, i would like to know if i can scale somehow instead of reingeneering the reportanalysis process maybe i am biased by the horizontal scaling thing  p  pthanksp

Negative 578 pThis is a follow up to another polymorphic question I had up a couple days ago.   I am creating a polymorphic association for an address.   In this case I simply wanted to see if it would work in a simple model, so I added an address to an article in an existing test blog I made.   My problem is I now can create an address with a new article knowing article will be a business, user, customer, etc in a real app and see it when I go to edit that business.   But if I edit the address, the addressableid for the existing address gets set to nil and a new address is created leaving the old one and updating the addressableid for the new one.   I cant imagine thats the correct behavior, though maybe Im doing it to myself some way.  p  pHeres the code.p  pArticle Modelp  precodeclass Article lt ActiveRecordBase   hasone address, as addressable   acceptsnestedattributesfor address end codepre  pAddress modelp  precodeclass Address lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto addressable, polymorphic true end codepre  pArticles controllerp  precodeclass ArticlesController lt ApplicationController   beforeaction setarticle, only [show, edit, update, destroy]      GET articles    GET articles.json   def index     articles  Article.all   end     GET articles1    GET articles1.json   def show   end     GET articlesnew   def new     article  Article.new     address  article.buildaddressparams[address]   end     GET articles1edit   def edit     address  article.address  article.buildaddressparams[address]     end     POST articles    POST articles.json   def create     article  Article.newarticleparams      respondto do format       if article.save         format.html  redirectto article, notice Article was successfully created.          format.json  render action show, status created, location article        else         format.html  render action new          format.json  render json article.errors, status unprocessableentity        end     end   end     PATCHPUT articles1    PATCHPUT articles1.json   def update     address       respondto do format       if article.updatearticleparams         format.html  redirectto article, notice Article was successfully updated.          format.json  head nocontent        else         format.html  render action edit          format.json  render json article.errors, status unprocessableentity        end     end   end     DELETE articles1    DELETE articles1.json   def destroy     article.destroy     respondto do format       format.html  redirectto articlesurl        format.json  head nocontent      end   end    private      Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.     def setarticle       article  Article.findparams[id]     end       Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.     def articleparams       params.requirearticle.permitname, content, addressattributes gt [line1, line2, city, state, zip]     end end codepre  pMy DB Migration filep  precodeclass CreateAddresses lt ActiveRecordMigration   def change     createtable addresses do t       t.string line1       t.string line2       t.string city       t.string state, limit 2       t.integer zip, limit 5       t.references addressable, polymorphic true        t.timestamps     end      addindex addresses, [addressabletype, addressableid], unique true   end end codepre  pView is standardp  precodelt f.fieldsfor address do address gt   Fields n stuff..... lt end gt codepre  pAs I mention, everything seems to work on this level.

Negative 578 pI have looked all over for an answer to this and havent found a way to achieve what I need to do, so I figured Id ask a question of my own.p  pI have 2 Menus in my UserControl as well as a ListView. Whenever the mouse hovers over any of the menuitems the End Day button in the picture below, in this case or the listview, a thin border appears around the control and then goes away when the mouse moves elsewhere. I dont know what this is called or how to locate it in XAML or Blend, but I would love to learn how to disable it both for menuitems and the listview and other controls as well if there is a univeral way of doing it, preferably in XAML.

Negative 578 pwe are developing an Android App to be used on 1 of 2 Android cameras. Specifically the Nikon S800C.p  pWe are able to use digital zoom but as yet we have not found a way of handling the hardware zoom which is the whole point of using a camera rather than a basic smart phone.p  pWe cannot use the internal camera app as we have to make a custom camera overlay and preview screen. As such we have had to compose our own camera app.p  pIt seems from what I have been advised it is not technically possible to control the camera hardware zoom from within our own app.p  pSo my question is Is this really the case Is there absolutely no way of building a custom camera app that has a custom camera capture experience and also a camera HARDWARE zoomp  pIf this is the case, is there a way of creating a custom preview and camera overlay screen for the existing internal camera app on our device Which would negate the need to build our own.p  pThanks.p

Here are my optionsp  h2Option 1h2  pEvery time a user logs in, I check if the hash starts with 2.

Negative 578 pHaving trawled Stack Overflow and Google it seems to me that there is no way to disable antialiasing when drawing lines on an HTML5 canvas.p  pThis makes for nice looking lines, but causes me a problem when it comes time to applying a paint bucket  flood fill algorithm.p  pPart of my application requires that users draw on a canvas, freestyle drawing with basic tools like line size, color... and a paint bucket.p  pBecause lines are rendered with antialiasing they are not a consistent color... with that in mind consider the followingp  ol liDraw a thick line in blackli liDecide at some point later that the line should be redli liApply flood fill to black lineli ol  pMy flood fill algorithm fills the bulk of the line with red, but the edges that were antialiased are detected as being outside the area that should be filled... hence remain  greys  blues left over from the black line.p  pThe flood fill algorithm does not incorporate something akin to tolerance like Photoshop does... I have considered something like that but am unsure it would help as I dont think the antialiasing does something simple like render grey next to a black line, I think its more advanced than that and the antialiasing takes into consideration the surrounding colors and blends.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how I can end up with a better paint bucket  flood fill that COMPLETELY flood fills  replaces an existing line or section of a drawingp
Negative 578 pI am pretty new to SQL and I am trying to generate a report that pulls from all kinds of different tables. The simple select lines that match up parts with KEYS is no problem.

This appears to be the work of the codeiscode operator.p  pMy questions are why does numpy have its own boolean type, and what is best practice in light of this situation  I can get away with writing codeif foocode to get expected behavior in the example above, but I like the more stringent codeif foo is Truecode because it excludes things like code2code and code[2]code from returning codeTruecode, and sometimes the explicit type check is desirable.p

Negative 578 pMy Java application has a launcher which is a .app and a helper app which is bundled with it.p  pI am trying to make .pkg installer with a background image using the following commandsp  precodepkgbuild root .Temp  identifier com.company.id installlocation Applications sign signature temp.pkg productbuild  packagepath temp.pkg distribution .Distribution.xml packagepath .Temp resources .Resources sign installer signature  FINALPKG codepre  pWhen I look in the directory at .Temp both of the .app folders are there and when I deconstruct the .pkg withp  pcodepkgutil expand temp.pkg tempcodep  pI see the .app folders but sometimes one of the .app folders do not show up when it is installed from the pkg. They always seem to show up the first time it is installed, but on machines where the application is installed and deleted many times like on test and development machines one of the .app folders will eventually not show up. I am wondering what could be going on herep  pInitially we had the helper app inside a separate directory as the main app and in this case, the helper app would sometimes not get installed but the main app always would be. Next, we tried putting the helper app inside of the main app and then this worked the first time but the next time I tried to to install from the installer the main app wasnt therep

Negative 578 pLets say were using the following branch strategy in gitp  ul liThe codemastercode branch for continuous development of new features.li liA codereleasecode branch which gets created at some point prior to an upcoming release to stabilize. li ul  pOnce the codereleasecode branch is created, some developers continue to commit to codemastercode working on features for later releases while other developers work to finalize the current release. During the existence of the codereleasecode branch, commits from codemastercode are strongnotstrong merged in to preserve the release branchs stability.p  pAt release time, the final commit in the codereleasecode branch is tagged with the release version. Then, a merge is performed from codereleasecode into codemastercode obviously not fastforward, due to concurrent development on both branches.p  pNow imagine later down the road after more commits to codemastercode, we want to reset the repository back to the state of the last release.p  pstrongWouldnt rolling back to the tagged release commit in codemastercode result in a different repository state than what we had on the codereleasecode branchstrong Unless Im missing something, this would be the case since the commits to codemastercode during the time when both branches were under active development have remained in the commit history even after rolling back codemastercode since they occurred before the tagged release commit.p  pRebasing instead of merging the codereleasecode branch back in to codemastercode would solve this problem it seems, but thats not a viable option with multiple developers working on codemastercode.p  pAny thoughtsp  pemstrongEDIT Thanks to jthills answer, adding diagrams to explain the situation and why I was confused.emstrongp  pHere is a diagram of what has actually happenedp  precode...oXoooM  master                                  abcR    release                                            v1.0, final commit in release branch codepre  pNow, here is a diagram of what the linear commit history looks like from codemastercode which was driving my mistaken mental model  note that the codeocode refs and the codeacodecodebcodecodeccode refs have intermingled based on their commit timestamps.

Negative 578 pIm trying to evaluate Feature Detectors and Descriptors with the FLANN algorithm based on this  a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsfeatures2dfeatureflannmatcherfeatureflannmatcher.html relnofollowtutorialap  pI want to build a strongROC curvestrong for the evaluation part therefore I have to get the TP, FN, FP and TN. The thing is, I dont know how to get these values I have read a lot of papers but none of them explain, for instance how they get the false positives. In the given tutorial you can set a certain threshold such that you can count the good and the bad matches, but thats not a justification that everthing was matched correctly. Should I count it for every image pairs by hand or is their a common technique do solve it automatically.   p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 578 pIm just wondering whats the best way to do a screen that looks pretty much like  the feed view in the Facebook app. I guess the most obvious answer would be to use a UITableView but there are lot of challenges.p  ol lipThere are comments in every feed item and for that we will have to use another UITableView. And that means a UITableView sitting inside a UITableViewCell.pli lipWe cant reuse the cells as there are several different content types.pli lipDetermining the height of the cell is again a problem as that depends on the number of comments in a feed item.pli ol  pIm not planning to do an app that looks like Facebook but this is just a food for thought I guess there is a better approach that using UITableView.

Negative 578 pIn Phonegap 3.xCordova 3.x Is there any hook so we can check which link the user clicked on our webpage.p  pBackground We added Google Maps to our cordova app. The Google Map comes with a c Google Inc. link which we are not allowed to remove oder modify. So when the user clicks on the c Google Inc. link, the Google Maps disclaimer appears and the user has no way of getting back to our app in iOS.  On Android and Windows Phone there are hardwareback buttons, but not on iOS.p  pIf we could hook into the URL opening event, we could intercept the call and open the link in an inappbrowser or in the system browser or something like that.p  pAny solution is welcome  whether as JavaScript, Phonegap Setting or ObjectiveC code. Also CWindows Phone or JavaAndroid, but as mentioned, the problem on these two platforms is neglectable due the hardware back button.p  pPS Maybe we can open EVERY link in an in app browser by a phonegap setting execpt links with a CSS class internal or something like that. In that case, we just would mark our links with the sayed classp  pThank youp

Negative 578 pI am trying to analyse the impact of error in meanvariance analysis from historical data. In particular, I am trying to calculate average efficient frontiers. I have the returns and standard deviation for the five assets under consideration, as well as the correlation matrix for the five assets. I used the functions mvnrnd to generate the monthly returns and frontcon for the efficient frontier. After generating the returns, I calculate the covariance of these. I run 10,000 simulations.p  pI have written the function below to do what I need, but it fails on the 150 yrs attempt with the message below. This is the my first time writing anything in MATLAB which I need to use, so I am not 100 sure of my code. It does produce graphs for the 2 yr and 30 yr time period, but I dont know if the failure of the 150 yr is due to my bad programming or not.

Performing OCR will see it spike to 114MB, then, once the process is complete and the results saved, the memory usage settles to about 84MB.

If I were using Linux, Id use a tool such as valgrind to help me spot the leak, but my leak sniffing skills on the windows side are sadly lacking.  Looking for advice on how to proceed.p

Negative 578 pI have a ListView with custom items, like this onep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comy3vY2.jpg altcustom listview itemp  pThe grey square is an ImageView. The data to fill the ListView comes from a database in the form of a Cursor. But the images are not directly stored in the database, but in the SDCard, the database only holds a String reference to them. p  pIn the beginning I was decoding the Image into a Bitmap from the overriden CursorAdapters bindView callback methodp  precode Bitmap bmp  BitmapFactory.decodeFileimageLocation  holder.imageHolder.setImageBitmapbmp codepre  pBut the ListView Scrolling was very laggy. So i read about Executor framework and implemented it, replacing the previous code with the followingp  precode ImageView imageView  holder.imageHolder  asyncImageLoader.DisplayImageimageLocation, imageView codepre  pAnd creating the AsyncImageLoader class. Which creates, in its constructor, a thread pool with maximum of 5 worker threads to take care of the Runnables sent to the work queue. Then, when I call the DisplayImage method from my custom CursorAdapter, it checks if the location String contains a url. If it does, an ImageLoader Runnable is sent to the thread pools work queue. If the location contains NA, a default image is set to the ImageView. p  pWhen an available worker thread takes care of the ImageLoader Runnable, the image in the SDCard is decoded into a Bitmap, and a ImageDisplayer Runnable is sent to the Main Threads message queue, to show the image in the UIp  precodepublic class AsyncImageLoader   ExecutorService executorService Handler handler  new Handler  public AsyncImageLoader      this.executorService  Executors.newFixedThreadPool5   public void DisplayImageString location, ImageView imageView      iflocation.matchesNA          queueImageDecodinglocation, imageView      else          imageView.setImageDrawableimageView.getContext.getResources.getDrawableR.drawable.notavailable        private void queueImageDecodingString location, ImageView imageView      executorService.executenew ImageLoaderlocation, imageView   class ImageLoader implements Runnable       private String location     private ImageView imageView      public ImageLoaderString location, ImageView imageView          this.location  location         this.imageView  imageView           Override     public void run          Bitmap bmp  BitmapFactory.decodeFilelocation         handler.postnew ImageDisplayerbmp, imageView         class ImageDisplayer implements Runnable       private Bitmap bitmap     private ImageView imageView      public ImageDisplayerBitmap bitmap, ImageView imageView          this.bitmap   bitmap         this.imageView  imageView           Override     public void run          ifbitmap  null              imageView.setImageBitmapbitmap                   codepre  pThe problem is that I am still getting the Laggy scrolling.

Isnt that code supposed to be processed in a worker thread What am i missing herep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSince the Views in the ListView are reused when the scrolling happens, the Bitmaps returned from the worker thread, are set several times in a single ImageView. So the possible solutions are p  ul liTo avoid setting the old Bitmap when the ListView item has already been reused. li liOr even better, cancel the task. li ul  pI am cancelling the tasks using a Future object.

If it is not, I cancel the task with Future.canceltrue. But now, the problem is that the tasks complete too fast to be cancelled. if I put the worker thread to sleep, for lets say 1 second, then the task lasts long enough to be cancelled and the ListView scrolling works better.

Negative 578 pI have been developing a research code using CMake to generate the Makefiles for a c code on an Ubuntu machine.  I link in several shared libraries which are rather involved to setup and build on a machine one in particular has a dozen or so version specific dependencies which themselves are non trivial to build.  Some are also custom builds of the library bug fixes.p  pI am more familiar with the windows environment with the CLR, but, what I am hoping to achieve is building the binary and including all of the shared libraries along with it.  Hopefully the linker on the other environment redhat EL6 would then be able to use those shared objects at runtime.p  pSince the linker doesnt look in the applications path, I assume I would also need to bring the shared libraries into a user specific library path for it to find.  p  pIs there a nice way using Cmake perhaps Cpack, to build the binary and package all of the shared objects with it for the other machine  Then I could even if manually install the shared libraries for my user only, and run the binary there.p  pIm hoping the answer is not using static libraries, as that has given me a lot of trouble for these dependencies in the past.p  pIm a linux noob, so if my issues is in lack of understanding a better approach I am all ears p

When I initially populate the deck everything works fine. All the cards are displayed.p  pWhen a Set is submitted, the game is multiplayer, so the Client sends the necessary information to the Server which then broadcasts that update to all the Clients. The update method that is run is the followingp  precodepublic void correctSetUpdateArrayListltIntegergt submittedTriplet, Player player      boolean removeRow  true      cardPanel.removeAll     cardPanel.addcardSet.get0.getJLabel      for int cardLocation  submittedTriplet          if cardSet.size gt N              cardSet.removecardLocation             if removeRow                  gridLayout.setRowsgridLayout.getRows  1                 removeRow  false                       else              if deck.deckSize  0                  cardPanel.updateCardcardLocation                                 for GraphicCard card cardSet          cardPanel.addcard.getJLabel       codepre  pThe codecardSetcode object is an codeArrayListcode of all codeGraphicCardcode currently on the board. Now here is the weird part. Where you see codecardPanel.removeAllcode and then I add something the next line, this works fine obviously its not the functionality that I want. I submit a set, it goes through the Server and now all of the boards have just that first card from codecardSetcode. If I remove that line and run the codeforcode loop that follows, none of the codecardPanelcode methods work anymore. If I invoke coderemoveAllcode after the for loop nothing happens, and if I try adding, nothing happens, at least not visually. What am I missing in this for loop that is causing the behavior of codecardPanelcode methods to behave so strange after this loopp
Negative 578 pI have an ASP.NET application that, among other things, is scraping another web site.  Im using a headless System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser control in an STA thread, using Navigate, handling the DocumentCompleted event, yada, yada.  The WebBrowser control navigates to the remote sites login page which uses javascript to fiddle with the DOM, thus the need for WebBrowser.  I set the UserID and Password fields then I call WebBrowser.Document.All[submit].InvokeMethodclick.p  pOn my development box running Windows 7 and IIS 7.5, this behaves as expected.  The next time DocumentCompleted fires, its clear that Ive successfully logged in and I go smartly about my business.

Negative 578 pI am trying to leverage my very modest Ruby experience with Ruboto.  I have installed the necessary packages, and the various demos work well on the simulator on Windows and on my Android device. I have been able to write some very simple Ruby scripts for Ruboto, but when they dont work, I have no visibility over what is happening.  The only error message I get is Unfortunately, xyz has stopped.p  pI assume there must be a way to troubleshoot a Ruboto script and get a log or some kind of detailed information on the reaction of the system to each line of code.br I have been googling that question for a while without success, and I apologize if I missed something obvious. I also tried adb catlog without getting any useful information related to the Ruby script, but maybe I was not able to find the right information in the thousands of line generated by this command.p  pI hope someone can point me in the right direction. Thanksp

Create a separate class that doesnt map that property but is otherwise identicalp  pI attempted the lazy loading solution, but as far as I can tell, theres no event listener for me to implement that would catch the lazy load and allow me to do the projection, so all of the geometries end up in Africa. The only solution I see to that problem is to find every time I would want to actually use that property and manually load and project it, but that just seems terrible to me.p  pstrongTLDRstrong Is there any way in NHibernate to set a property to lazy load or not load at all just for a particular query, or would it be better to just create another class and not map the geometry in that one I dont want the geometry loaded into memory at all, so a projection wont help.p

Negative 578 pI am trying to find a way to encode a database ID into a short codeURLcode, e.g. 1 should become Ys47R. Then I would like to decode it back from Ys47R to 1 so I can run a database search using the codeINTcode value. It needs to be unique using the database codeIDcode. The sequence should not be easily guessable such as 1  Ys47R, 2  Ys47S. It should be something along the lines of YouTube or bitlys codeURLscode.

I cant get my head around advance techniques using codebase32code or codebase64code. p  pOr am I looking into this too much and there is an easier way to do it Would it be best to do the random string function above and query the database to check for uniqueness all the timep

Negative 578 pNow that we have GPGPUs with languages like CUDA and OpenCL, do the multimedia SIMD extensions SSEAVXNEON still serve a purposep  pI read an article recently about how SSE instructions could be used to accelerate sorting networks. I thought this was pretty neat but when I told my comp arch professor he laughed and said that running similar code on a GPU would destroy the SIMD version. I dont doubt this because SSE is very simple and GPUs are large highlycomplex accelerators with a lot more parallelism, but it got me thinking, are there many scenarios where the multimedia SIMD extensions are more useful than using a GPU p  pIf GPGPUs make SIMD redundant, why would Intel be increasing their SIMD support SSE was 128 bits, now its 256 bits with AVX and next year it will be 512 bits. If GPGPUs are better processing code with data parallelism why is Intel pushing these SIMD extensions They might be able to put the equivalent resources research and area into a larger cache and branch predictor thus improving serial performance.p  pWhy use SIMD instead of GPGPUsp

In server 1 the data is stored in log files, and it is being inserted into MySQL on server 2. Some of the data is already in MySQL on server 2, so there are many failures. However, if I do not use batch inserts, and I have a separate codeINSERT INTOcode for every of the millions of records things seem to run much more slowly. So Im in trouble either way with batch inserts, duplicate failures blow up the whole statement, and without batch inserts the process takes much much longer.p
Negative 578 pIve already had a lot of help with this problem, so I feel bad asking for more, but its another one thats been driving me a little insane. My goal here is to create a code that takes the letters in a string and gives out a score like in Scrabble. It has to account for double words scoresdictated by a  and double letter score dictated by a . p  precodeExample If you input was Hello, then the first l was played on a double letter score space, and the final o was played on a             double word score space. The output score would be 18. codepre  pThanks to help from raysome other letters I finally got it to read off the score value if there were no double words or double letters, but now I cant seem to get it to figure out those. If I could have some guidance in how to go about it, I would appreciate it. p  precodedoubleword   Here I labeled some things doubleletter   doublew  strfindword, doubleword1 I want to find where the double words are doublewb  2 trouble  strfindword, doubleletter1 I want to find where double letters are troubleb  letterPoints2 Convert  word stringToConvert  lowerConvert ASCII  doublestringToConvert  96 Origscore  sumvaluesASCII score  doublewbsumOrigscoretroubleb codepre  pThe last line gives me trouble. I get an array and now just a nice clean number. Furthermore, when I try to run my simple string matlab, it gives me an error. Or a really weird, not a simple number. I think I need to do some further indexing, but Im a little confused. I know this is supposed to be the hardest problem, though Ive been struggling with them all. Quartziferous should give 220. Ramblingwreck should give 54.p  pAnd on another note, whats a really good book to read for MATLAB I have two books Engineering Computation for MATLAB and a simple Intro to MATLAB book, but neither are terribly helpful.p

Negative 578 pIm looking to use an existing video player library for iOS apps with HLS support so that I can implement a player with some very specific networking behavior, as opposed to letting Apple decide the size and timing of requests. It needs to be customizable enough to support new networking policies such that I can override the request sizes, change what files are requested, and read data from an existing local cache file. In short, Im attempting to override the networking portion that actually calls out and fetches the segments such that I can feed in data from partial cache as well as make specific algorithmic changes to the timing and size of external HTTP requests. p  pIve tried AV Foundations AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate Protocol but, unless there is something Im not seeing, there doesnt seem to be a way to override the outgoing requests and just feed bytes to the media player. p  pIve also looking into VLC but unfortunately my current project is incompatible with a GPL license. p  pIdeally, there would be a way to directly feed bytes or complete segments to MPMoviePlayerController, but I cant find any way of accomplishing this in the API. The only method Im aware that works is using a local HTTP server, which I have been doing but it seems overly complicated when all Im really trying to do is override some internal networking code. p  pAny suggestions of another way of doing this p

Negative 578 pI am using WindowBuilder in Eclipse to aid in my GUI design. I am trying to make a Jlist popup after the user either enters in a text file with integers in it or, if they enter a file that doesnt exist, they select a file with integers in it from JFileChooser. My problem I am having now is that when the file is selected, nothing happens. The program also doesnt seem to recognize when I do enter in a file that exists, it just defaults to the JFileChooser.

Negative 578 pWhen pulling up my Dojo Mobile app on an iPad with iOS 8, the ComboBox dropdown doesnt get placed correctly.

Negative 578 pI have some .m4a files that were captured from a radio broadcast stream. They are playable using strongmpdstrong an open source Music Playing Daemon for nix, but iTunes wont open them nor will several other music players that should be able to play .m4a files. When I looked at the file in hex format, and compared it to an .m4a file from iTunes, it appeared that the file from the broadcast stream did not have any header info.p  pSo I figured Id try prepending some header info to the file, to see if that would make it playable by these other players.p  pIve tried to read the technical doc about the .m4a file format to understand how the header is structured, but its far too complex for me to follow most of the doc is about the coding, which isnt pertinent to this. The header seems fairly simple, conceptually  I can see 4character tags, variable length data, and there are presumably some length codes to allow these to be split apart. It emdoesntem seem to contain any significant data about the actual audio data like its total length, making me hopeful that I might be able to get by by simply copying the header from an .m4a file and prepending it to these headerless files.p  pIm unable, though, to manually parse that is, reverseengineer the header in order to even experiment with this. Can someone describe how to identify a complete header at the front of a .m4a file p

Negative 578 pWhat is the best way to display very complex cards in a table viewp  pI am displaying views inside table view cells to get a card effect. On these views I have multiple buttons, labels, other views and nearly always another tableview.p  pThese views were all designed in their own View file .xib.  I populate an array containing all of these views in the order Id like to display them and then when cellForRowAtIndexPath gets called I simply add these views as subviews to a view all ready on the cell. Each of these cards can resize their cell at will and each card has a different, dynamically calculated height.p  pEverything works perfectly but scrolling lags immensely. Scrolling through these cards arent smooth at all, it is jumpy an laggy. Also if I rotate the device the rotation animation has at most 10 frames meaning it is very laggy as well.p  pWhat is the best and the correct way to display these cards views with a lot of UI components in the tableview cellsp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 578 pThis is my first question on Stack Overflow so please bear with me.p  pI am currently working on a Cocos2dx application. Cocos2dx v3.3. I want to keep the GL View fixed to Landscape Left and handle the rotation manually. Why I want to do this is a little tricky but in short I have custom animations for the UI repositioning itself moving around while the device rotates. By keeping the GL View fixed and rotating the scene  doing some basic mathematical manipulation I am able to achieve this.p  pThis approach causes a problem for the native views presented by iOS. They always show up in landscape left. I fixed this problem on iOS 7 by creating a new view controller [frontVC] and presented it modally on the Root View Controller using the following codep  precodeself.frontVC  [[FrontViewController alloc ]init] rvc .modalPresentationStyle  UIModalPresentationCurrentContext  [rvc presentViewControllerself.frontVC animatedYES completionnil] codepre  pThe supportedInterfaceOrientation method in Root View Controller is as followsp  precode NSUInteger supportedInterfaceOrientations return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscapeLeft codepre  pIn Front View Controller presented modally supportedInterfaceOrientation is as follows p  precode NSUInteger supportedInterfaceOrientations return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAll codepre  pThe approach above makes sure that the status bar and other native views such as alert views rotate according to the device rotation  orientation. Note  Since this view is transparent we are still able to see the GL View and interact with it without any issues.p  pHowever, Apple changed everything around on iOS 8 and I am stuck. If I present the Front View Controller via Current Context then viewDidDisappear is triggered for the Root View Controller and a black view appears. If I present the Front View Controller via Over Context p  precodeself.frontVC.modalPresentationStyle  UIModalPresentationOverCurrentContext  codepre  pthen the presented view becomes transparent but it follows the rotation of the presenting view Root View Controller which has no use for me since I need this frontVC to auto rotate.p  pThe question is, Can I achieve the behavior I had on iOS 7 without actually having to go back into my Cocos2dx implementation and changing itp  pP.S. I would be happy to edit my question with more details that anyone might feel are necessary. I have added the details I felt were necessary.p

Negative 578 pThe Oracle documentation on the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docstechnotesguideslanguagecatchmultiple.htmlmulticatch featurea added to Java 7 states that the exception parameter in the codecatchcode clause is implicitly codefinalcode.p  pMy question is strongwhats the point of such restrictionstrong Because i cant seem to find a single crucial improvement it brings. Marking a reference object as codefinalcode only protects the reference itself from being modified, not the object it references, and one is never prohibited to create another reference and modify it in whatever way they want.p  pA a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions16959436javacatchblockcaughtexceptionisnotfinalsomewhat relevant question on SOa discusses the reasons why modifying the exception reference in a codecatchcode clause is not the wisest thing to do, but it relates to emanyem use of the codecatchcode clause, not just the multicatch form of it. So why does Java make an, ahem, exception for the multicatch and treat it in a special wayp  pThanksp

Negative 578 pI can get to one of my pages from different places in the site. Depending on where youre coming from, the URL might have a key in it.

Negative 578 pI have to develop an app both for iOS and Android. This app uses a small sqlite database with sensitive data, and depending on the users input, it makes some process with this data. After this process is made, the database is no longer accessed unless the user has to enter a new input its not probable that this happens.p  pSince the database has sensitive data I have to protect it. I know is impossible to get a complete protection but I would like to make life harder for a possible attacker.p  pAnd since I dont know too much about security Im not sure what would be the best alternative taking into account difficulty  security.p  pIve thought in two alternativesp  p1 Include the database in the apps and encrypt or obfuscate it. p  pBut I guess it wouldnt be very difficult to get the database with a rooted Android.p  p2 Have the database stored in a server, each time the user enters the input the app downloads the database, the process is made and after that I remove the database from the app.p  pBut the process takes 510 minutes and maybe this time is enough to get the database from the app, so I would have to add the same protection as in 1 plus a protection in the server.p  pWhich would be the best option difficult  security There would be any other optionsp  pIve tried several Google searches but Im confuse with all that information and I would like to try with the huge acknowledge of this community.p  pUPDATED p  pWell, reading your answers Im inclined to have a backend and not download the database to the app. Its not the preferred solution of the client, but it seem is the best by far so Ill try to convince it.

The div displays  of coins, the first button adds 1 coin every time it is clicked, the 2nd button is upgrade coins button, which will subtract a certain number of coins.p  pall of the addition and subtraction of coins will be handled server side. My understanding is if I use session variables to store the data on the server, that they are invulnerable to cheat engine or other memory editing tools. Correct me if I am wrong on this.p  pSo when the user clicks the add coin button the coins div will increase by 1 or some greater amount later. I understand that can be done very simply with something likep  precodediv1.loadupdate.php codepre  pso is this vulnerable to js injection, inother words can someone alter it to add more than 1 coin when it is clicked, my thinking is probably not.p  pfinally is it possible to update more than 1 element from the same jquery request, for example if I want to change both div1 and div2 from the same request or is it best to do that as 2 separate requests also lets say that there is more than 1 piece of data returned by the request. Is this where a Json file would come in handyp  pThanksp

Surface created this way will have lots of rough edges but that is not a problem. Connecting the points in the space to create surfaces is OK, but those surfaces also has point on them. Computing such a thing would be very expensive, since a lot of computations involved. For example, lets say, I would like to create a surface by using 20x20 matrix. Rows and columns will be the x and y coordinates, values in each row and column will be the z coordinate.p  pI need to connect at least 3 dots to make a surface. Those surfaces have also points in them. I want to design such an algorithm that reduces the computations. How do I do thatp
Negative 578 pon my project someone recently changed project references as a hack to get something done. This caused CI build failures and other waste. Is it possible to create an msbuild task that can look at project references solution wide to check project references against a known good configuration, and for the build to fail in the case of unexpected changes. I realise this masks a deeper problem but the waste generated last time this happened is considered unacceptable and Ive been asked to make sure it doesnt happen again.p

Negative 578 pI am using the following VBA script to parse through a word document and open every OLE table object, copy the table, and paste back into word so that the data in the tables can be searchable. However, after the script runs for a while, Word gives me an error message stating Word has encountered a problem. You will not be able to undo this action once it is completed. Do you want to continue Clicking yes leads the document to stop responding and crash with no changes been made. Choosing No just keeps repopping up the same message and Im assuming this leads to the changes not being saved. Is something wrong with the script  I thought it was somehow filling up the memory by opening all those OLE objects, but I think activating the word document shifts focus from the OLE object and hence closes the embedded table to continue parsing through the original document. I think its probably related to each iteration of the loop although the message doesnt show up for every OLE table. I am stuck as to how to investigate further into what is causing this issue.p  precode    wrdActDoc.InlineShapeslShapeCnt.OLEFormat.Activate     Selection.Document.Select     Selection.WholeStory     Selection.Cut     wrdActDoc.Activate     Selection.PasteAndFormat wdPasteDefault codepre

Negative 578 pEdit JSFiddle as per request a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net5anz0kgt1 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.net5anz0kgt1ap  pEdit 2 It seems the animation interruption in fact is related to the order of the elements... If the new banenr layer is on top of the old one, the animation will be smooth. If the new banner is beneath, the animation appears choppy.  The new question therefore becomes why, and how can I fix thisp  pI am currently finishing up a small banner, and am having some trouble with animations. p  pOriginally, I just had the following functions controlling the banner visibility and animations which workedp  precodefunction fadeOutel     el.style.transition  opacity 0.5s linear 0s     el.style.opacity  0   function fadeInel     el.style.transition  opacity 0.5s linear 0s     el.style.opacity  1  codepre  pBut I quickly noticed that this of course made buttons unclickable on the banners due to element stacking.p  pI therefore decided to set display none on non visible banner layers. For fading in, I simply added p  precodeel.style.display   codepre  pbut for fading out I needed to insure the css animation had completed before I could hide the layer. So I added courtesy of a hrefhttpdavidwalsh.namecssanimationcallback relnofollowhttpdavidwalsh.namecssanimationcallbackap  precodevar transitionEvent  whichTransitionEventel     transitionEvent ampamp el.addEventListenertransitionEvent, function          el.style.display  none      codepre  pto the end of the fadeOut function. The issue now is that the transition is now very abrupt most of the time  it seems to work a small subset of the time.p  pLeaving only the display code in fadeIn works, pointing to the fadeOut changes as the issue. Watching in firebug, I can see the display changes coming into play only after the opacity animation finishes, however.p  pHow can I insure that my display code doesnt interrupt the animation, or alternatively, how else can I solve the element stacking problemp

Negative 578 pI am using version 3.4 of the SonarQube Eclipse Plugin and when I analyze a project, the scan is successful, but it scans all files.

I have SonarQube running successfully on a server and I can view all of the current issues in my project using a web browser. p  pAlso, when I view the sonarreport.json file that is generated on my computer as a result of the scan, all of the issues have the isNew tag set to true and the update date equals the creation date which equals the time of the scan. I know this is incorrect because some of the issues are preexisting and should have a creation date of a month ago because this is what I see when looking at the issue on my server through my web browser.p  pTo me it seems as if Eclipse is not synchronizing the existing issues properly with the server because it seems to not recognize any of them. Please let me know what may be wrong. Thank you.p

Negative 578 pI am currently working on a bank project in C and have begun to test it by using a TestBank method that will run some tests on the program if I ask it to with the use of codeTestBank.RunTestscodep  pI am struggling to perform two tests, one that will check an accounts initial balance to see if it contains 0 before any depositing or withdrawing occurs, and the other being to not allow an account to hold a negative number. I have attempted the first test but I am not 100 sure its right as it seems to me that I am just creating an account with 0 and accepting that instead of finding out the balance and judging whether the amount is correct or not from that, this can be seen belowp  precodepublic static void Test1              Console.WriteRunning Test 1...         CustomerAccount TestAccount  new CustomerAccountTestUser, 0         ifTestAccount.GetBalance  0                      Console.WriteLineTest Passed                  else                      Console.WriteLineTest Failed                      codepre  pThe other test is proving to be a bit more difficult to me as I am trying to check the balance within the account in this case it will be 50 and rejecting it if it is a negative. I have a class called CheckInitialValue but I am not sure how I would use this to construct the test, this can also be seen belowp  precodepublic virtual bool CheckInitialValuedecimal balance                      if balance lt 0  balance gt 10000                              return false                          return true          codepre  pI have attempted to structure it similar to the first test where I am creating a new account but with a balance of 50, I then want to check that 50 and reject it.p  pAny help with this problem will be much appreciated.p

Negative 578 pI am trying to figure out how to continuously monitor an automated SSH session I spawned in my Expect script for shell errors. Is there a way to have a background process that continuously searches the output of my SSH session for kshp  pIn KSH, I would simply trap ERR signals, but ERR is not a valid signal type in Expect. The point is that Id like to monitor for shell errors so I can go through my exit handler rather than the Expect script continuing execution.p  pBelow is one of my shell functionsexpect scripts. This particular script spawns and SSH session to a partner server and sourcesruns several user defined shell functions. When the initlog function is sourced and executed, log files are created and STDOUTSTDERR are redirected to those logs  hence the need for the tee devtty command so that I can see STDOUT from the functions I am running on the partner server. I am not sure if I should temporarily redirect STDERR to the screen and expect ksh at each of my expect blocks, or if there is an easier and hopefully more robust method to monitor if a shell error occurs at any point during my SSH session.p  precodefunction exprunfuncs   Check for DEBUG mode [[ n DEBUG ]] ampamp typeset PS40  ampamp set x     Log status message logstdout 0 Running functions on the rsvr server.
