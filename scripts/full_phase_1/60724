Positive 60724 pHas anyone figured out how to make Tomcat 7 support SSL connections to iOS 9 apps without configuring an NSAppTransportSecurity exception in the appp  pI know that iOS 9 requires TLSv1.2 and Forward Secrecy. In my server.xml file I tried removing all the references to older versions of TLS and for the ciphers I listed only the ECDHE variants, which I believe support forward secrecy. This not only failed to allow the iOS app to connect, but it also prevented Chrome and Safari from making an SSL connection to the same server.p  pWill it help if I upgrade to Tomcat 8p  pDo I need a different version of Java andor some addon to Java Im currently using Java 1.7.085, which is what comes with Amazons default Linux AMI and seems to be the latest version available.p  pCould the problem have anything to do with my certificate It is a wildcard cert that I obtained from GoDaddy in May, so it is relatively new.p  pThanks.p
Positive 60724 pThis has been making me work overtime and I still dont have much clues.

All the processes, from PuTTy, to Chrome, to Firefox. There were a lot of those already running in the background. The odd thing is that the user column of these processes is set to SYSTEM, while the normal browser sessions, for example, the user is set to IT, which is my current Windows user account.p  pI have been trying to manually change the user in which these processes are invoked, but no luck so far. p  pSo apparently, my application works in Windows as well, just not as I intended. All the processes, regardless if its a command line script or a desktop application like firefox or chrome, they just dont appear but they run in the background under the user SYSTEM. And I dont have any idea why. It sure doesnt look like its supposed to be the default behavior. So if anyone have any idea, Id really appreciate it. p  pThanks.p

Does anyone know a way to do this from within a Crystal Report p  pThe specific control character we are trying to send is CHR2.

We do have drivers for it, but are encountering various problems  the infrastructure group knows more about the problems than I do, I dont feel I have enough information to try and ask about the specific problem.

Value can be any object such as a Color, Array, Font etc. Any time the text changes, the property Value is changed as long as it is valid.p  pLooking at the msdn article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms229615.aspx relnofollowHow to Apply the PropertyNameChanged Patterna  , it says I should use the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms229615.aspx relnofollowPropertyNameChanged Event patterna  from the control side.p  pNow, If I have DataSourceUpdateMode  OnValidate, then I dont even need to apply this pattern. If, say. my Value property is bound to a colour field in a business object, then after I type red, in the textbox and tab to another field, then any other fields on the form, that bind to the same colour field, are updated immediately.p  pIf, however, my DataSourceUpdateMode  OnPropertyChange, I would expect all other fields, on the form, to update as soon as I press d as in red.p  pThis doesnt happen. So, I apply the aforementioned PropertyNameChanged Pattern and it still doesnt happen.p  pHowever, If I remove the PropertyNameChanged event and, instead, use INotifyPropertyChanged, it works perfectly. p  pMy problem is, that according to the article, INotifyPropertyChanged is supposed to be used by your business objects and not the user control.p  pIt works, but I dont want to run into any future problems.p  pAnyone have any idea whats going onp  h2ETAh2  pAssuming it is ok to use INotifyPropertyChanged, I now have a further problem. I dont want users to have to subscribe to the PropertyChanged event, and then examine the arguments to see if the property Value sent it. So, I addp  precodePublic Event ValueChanged As EventHandlerOf EventArgs codepre  pThis breaks the binding. The source is not even updated on validation, let alone on property change.p  pI presume I have to rename the ValueChanged event to FeckingValueChanged or something.p  pI wouldnt mind so much if the framework actually did something with the raised ValueChange event in the first placep

Negative 60724 pIm working on a questionnaire type application in which questions are stored in a database.  Therefore, I create my controls dynamically on every Page.OnLoad. This works like a charm and ViewState is persisted between postbacks because I ensure that my dynamic controls strongalwaysstrong have the same generated Control.ID.p  pIn addition to the user control that dynamically populates the questions, my questionnaire page also contains a Status section also encapsulated by a user control which represents the status of the questionnaire choices are Complete, Started or In Progress.  If the user changes the status of questionnaire i.e. from In Progress to Complete, I need to postback to the server because the contents of the dynamic portion of the questionnaire depend on the selected status.  p  pSome questions are always present regardless of status, and yet others may not be present at all for the selected status.  The point is, when the status changes, I have to postback to the page and render the right set of questions.  Additionally, I need to preserve any user entered values for those questions which are always available.p  pHowever, due to the page life cycle in ASP.NET, the Status user controls OnLoad, which contains the correct status needed to load the right questions from the DB, doesnt get executed until after the dynamic questions user control has already been populated with the wrongstale values.p  pTo get around this, I raise an event from my Status user control to the main page to indicate that the Status has changed.  The main page then raises an event on the dynamic questions user control.  Since by the time this event bubbles up, the dynamic questions user control has already loaded  the wrong questions from the DB, it first calls Controls.Clear. It then happily uses the new status to query the database for the correct questions and does a Control.Add on each.  FYI, Control.IDs are consistent across postbacks. p  pThis solution works...sorta.  The correct set of questions for the selected status do get rendered however ViewState is getting lost for those always available questions.  Im guessing this is because the dynamic questions user control calls Controls.Clear when responding to the status changed event. This must somehow kill the association between ViewState and my dynamic controls, even though the Control.IDs are consistent.p  pThis seems like such a common requirement, Im virtually certain there is a better, cleaner and less error prone approach to accomplish this.  In case its not plainly obvious, I havent been able to grok the ASP.NET page lifecycle despite working with it for the last year.  Any help is much appreciatedp

And Ive been looking for a long timep  pFrom reviewing other questions here, it looks like a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocXML3a3aCompile3a3aSOAP relnofollowXMLCompileSOAPa seems to be the popular tool in recent times.  Ive worked out a way to get my code served as a service through it, but I also had to manually massage a .WSDL file I started with a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocPod3a3aWSDL relnofollowPodWSDLa.p  pIs there a more direct approach that Im not finding on CPAN or elsewhere a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocPod3a3aWSDL relnofollowPodWSDLa by default spits out rpcencoded, which I understand is not the best way anymore.  The docs say that documentliteral is not supported yet, and reading the source you can see parts of the code that do documentliteral, but it doesnt work directly with a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocXML3a3aCompile3a3aSOAP relnofollowXMLCompileSOAPa. Ideally I add a few annotations to our code in either POD or perl5 attributes, and push a button, and get WSDL that I can feed to the XMLCompile package.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 60724 pIm playing around with a Canvas inside of a Viewbox, and unforunately, the only way to see the elements in the Canvas, I have to assign it a Height and Width.  However, the problem is that my Height and Width values come from my ViewModel via databinding.p  pI know that Blend gets around this with the codedcode designer namespace, which is set to codexmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008code.  Id like to use something similar for VS2008, so that in the designer I can specify those values and see what Im working with.p  pThe other option is to hardcode the values for now and then switch back and forth as necessary, but Id rather have the optimal solution, if possible.

Negative 60724 pI built dcraw.c httpwww.cybercom.netdcoffindcrawdcraw.c as a windows command line application with cygwin  gcc before.

Also the VC built version seems to be faster. So much for the prelude.p  pThe actual question is this When I use the final application say as in dcraw T 4 .NEF  The cygwin  gcc built version will process all NEF files in my directory while the visual studio built one says .NEF Invalid argumentp  pI have no idea why that is and am looking for a way to fix this.

Is it really an issue concerning messagecontractsp  pstrongMAYBE THE SOLUTIONstrongp  pOK everybody, maybe I can see the light... If I remove all codeDataContractcodes and codeServiceContractcodes attributes namespace and names always without codeMessageContractcodes, everything works. Well, I get wsdl and types, but t worked even with them but always without codeMessageContractcodes. Heres why I would like to get confirm from youp  pThe namespace I specified a hrefhttpopcfoundation.orgwebservicesXMLDA1.0 relnofollowhttpopcfoundation.orgwebservicesXMLDA1.0a is not a simple name, well, here you can find WSDL definitions for my operations and types already defined. My svc does not generate complete WSDL definitions with types BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS THEM defined in that namespace I providedp  pWhat do you think about thisp

Negative 60724 pI have a few questions that i would like to clear p  ol lipCan u use SqlDependency or SqlCacheDependency to find out which particular data item has changed in the databasepli lipRight now , i am using SqlCacheDependency by having a background thread that periodically checks the value of cache. If the cache is null, it reads data from database and inserts it into the cache. Is there a better way to do it rather than using a background thread for polling the cache periodicallypli lipIf i understand correctly, SqlDependency works by having a dependency for a command. Once a notification occurs, an onchangeevent is fired . In the event handler , you unregister the dependency and create a new one . Is there any other purpose for this Onchangeevent handler For instance, can i find out which item has changed, push the new data to clients from here,etc pli lipWith SqlCacheDependency, i believe i have to poll the cache periodically. With sqlDependency, i need not poll at all. Is this true pli ol  pThanks in advancep

Negative 60724 pThis is a bit of a crazy question, but does anyone out there know how to go about writing an extra compile step into the flex compiler. The idea would be that the MXML compiler would knock out the MXML to AS3 code as it does, but we have an extra step between the AS3 code and the bytecode. p  pThe reason why I ask, is that this would be a great step to handle things like metadata tags to make code changes. A common practice in a lot of frameworks is to have an [Inject] tag before a variable.  I.e. [Inject] public var userIUser. p  pWhat would be really, really cool, is if the inject tag could be recognised, interpreted in some way, and then hardwired to a singleton, or whatever. For example, you could have a config file that defines IUser to be a User object. The compiler would interpret that, and replace the [Inject] public var userIUser with public var userIUserUserConfig.instance.userp  pThis is jsut one of the many things that would be possible if I knew how to do this step. I was just wondering if someone would know even where to start about how to go about doing this.p

Negative 60724 pI have a database of games and prices, in which I recently found yet another issue.

If there is ONLY a mac version of the game, however, I would like to keep it.p  pThe issue was made a bit simpler for me since all games that also have a mac version will use the exact same name plus a small snippet at the end to indicate its for mac.

Ive been trying to pin down a bug that might be causing it, but I am beginning to believe that my problems are being caused by a failure in logic, but of course I am not seeing where. p  pMy understanding of the iterative algorithm is as followsp  ul lipA stack is created holding representations of cell states. pli lipEach representation holds the coordinates of that particular cell, and a list of directions to access adjacent cells.pli lipWhile the stack isnt empty iterate through the directions on the top of the stack, testing adjacent cells.pli lipIf a valid cell is found place it at the top of the stack and continue with that cell.pli ul  pHere is my recursive implementation  note keydown to step forward  a hrefhttpjsbin.comurilan14 relnofollowhttpjsbin.comurilan14ap  pAnd here is my iterative implementation  once again, keydown to step forward  a hrefhttpjsbin.comeyosij2 relnofollowhttpjsbin.comeyosij2ap  pThanks for the help. p  pedit I apologize if my question wasnt clear. I will try to further explain my problem.p  pWhen running the iterative solution various unexpected behaviors occur. First and foremost, the algorithm doesnt exhaust all available options before backtracking. Rather, it appears to be selecting cells at a random when there is one valid cell left. Overall however, the movement doesnt appear to be random. p  precodevar dirs  [ N, W, E, S ] var XD   N 0, S0, E1, W1  var YD   N1, S1, E0, W 0    function genMaze  var dirtemp  dirs.slice.slice    copies dirs so its not overwritten or altered var path  []                          stores path traveled.  var stack  [[0,0, shuffledirtemp]] Stack of instances. Each subarray in stacks represents a cell                                        and its current state. That is, its coordinates, and which adjacent cells have been                                        checked. Each time it checks an adjacent cell a direction value is popped from                                         from the list  while  stack.length gt 0      var current  stack[stack.length1]  With each iteration focus is to be placed on the newest cell.    var x  current[0], y  current[1], d  current[2]   var sLen  stack.length              For testing whether there is a newer cell in the stack than the current.   path.push[x,y]                     Store current coordinates in the path    while  d.length gt 0       if stack.length  sLen  break If there is a newer cell in stack, break and then continue with that cell      else        var cd  d.pop       var nx  x  XD[ cd ]       var ny  y  YD[ cd ]        if  nx gt 0 ampamp ny gt 0  ampamp nx lt w ampamp ny lt h ampamp cells[nx][ny]           dtemp  dirs.slice.slice         cells[nx][ny]  1         stack.push [ nx, ny, shuffledtemp ]  add new cell to the stack with new list of directions.                                                    from here the code should break from the loop and start again with this latest addition being considered.                      if current[2].length  0stack.pop  if all available directions have been tested, remove from stack    return path  codepre  pI hope that helps clear up the question for you. If it is still missing any substance please let me know. p  pThanks again.p

Negative 60724 pIm looking at ways to reduce the number of queries that are being performed on my MySQL server. p  pThe application and database servers are on separate machines, so it seems caching previous query results on the application server is not a bad option to pursue. Obviously there are other strategies like reducing the number of queries and optimizing the query statements, however I dont think I should discount query caching as an option.p  pI was initially thinking that I could easily turn on some form of query caching in the codeZendDbcode object, however the closest Ive come to seeing something crosscut is the codeZendDbProfilercode.p  pOne approach I was considering was to create a proxy for my codeZendDbAdaptercode object.

Each of these dynamic content views lies in a separate div.p  pIm trying to write a function that can handle all of these cases, including the initial load of the page, since all dynamic content is initially hidden with css.

The premature removal of an element, or appearance of another, causes my layout to change momentarily until the final layout is reached. I suspect the promise function implements such a delay.p  pEDITp  pI found a solution that seems to work well for me. Since my initial fade out was intended to handle the event that multiple views had somehow become unhidden which was happening a lot for other reasons, use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout I decided it would be better to try to just immediately kill anything thats in the process of fading from a previous call, then do my regular fadingp  precodecontainer.children.contentview.filterfunctionreturn this.cssopacity lt 1.eachfunction      this.stop     this.cssopacity,0     this.csshidden,none   if container.children.contentview.filterfunctionreturn this.cssdisplay  none.length gt 0     container.children.contentview.filterfunctionreturn this.cssdisplay  none.fadeOuttransition, function      content.fadeIntransition  else     content.fadeIntransition codepre  pHope that makes sense. I didnt know about the filter function before. Quite handy p  pNote that in my case, this works because this is the only way that any of the content gets swapped, and it will only leave one element tree fully visible or getting there at the end of each call. If that has not finished revealing by the next one, it gets killed immediately and replaced.p

This sample file  loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.  Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled in defaults.   READ THIS This example file is NOT an exhaustive list of vsftpd options.  Please read the vsftpd.conf.5 manual page to get a full idea of vsftpds  capabilities.   Allow anonymous FTP Beware  allowed by default if you comment this out. anonymousenableYES   Uncomment this to allow local users to log in. localenableYES   Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command. writeenableYES   Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022,  if your users expect that 022 is used by most other ftpds localumask022   Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only  has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will  obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user. anonuploadenableYES   Uncomment this if you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create  new directories. anonmkdirwriteenableYES   Activate directory messages  messages given to remote users when they  go into a certain directory. dirmessageenableYES   Activate logging of uploadsdownloads. xferlogenableYES   Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 ftpdata. connectfromport20YES   If you want, you can arrange for uploaded anonymous files to be owned by  a different user.

Not enabling it,  however, may confuse older FTP clients. asyncaborenableYES   By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore  the request. Turn on the below options to have the server actually do ASCII  mangling on files when in ASCII mode.  Beware that on some FTP servers, ASCII support allows a denial of service  attack DoS via the command SIZE bigfile in ASCII mode. vsftpd  predicted this attack and has always been safe, reporting the size of the  raw file.  ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol. asciiuploadenableYES asciidownloadenableYES   You may fully customise the login banner string ftpdbannerWelcome to blah FTP service.

This is disabled by  default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive IO on large  sites.

Negative 60724 pIm working in a clients SQL Server 2005 database and Im seeing some odd behavior.  I have a little experience with 2008, but this is my first battle with 2005, so Im hoping this turns out to be something simple related to my inexperience.p  pstrongWhat am I trying to dostrong I am developing a sales dashboard in SSRS 2005.  One of the report parameters is a multivalue parameter which I need to pass to a stored procedure.  I found a work around in some blogs, as well as here on SO, and implemented a function which splits a comma delimited varchar, and returns a table.  I need this function to return the correct values from within the procedure, since I am calling stored procedures for the SSRS datasets.p  pstrongMy Problemstrong When I execute the function directly from within SSMS for a given value, I receive a table with 7 rows as expected.  When I execute a procedure that calls that function, with the same values passed, it only returns 1 row in the table.  The user executing the function and the procedure is also the owner of both objects.p  pIve done a lot of homework to get to this point prior to posting the question, so I hope Ive done my due diligence here.  The client hasnt given me privileges to work with SQL Profiler, so I havent been able to dig in that direction.p  pI thought perhaps this could be a permissions issue, but the fact that the function is still executed and does return 1 row instead of 7 confused me. It appears to only return the first number from the comma dilimitted string.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong What the heck is causing the behavior outlined below Please let me know if I should provide any additional information.p  pstrongExecuted from SSMSstrongp  precodedeclare       SiteID varcharmax      set SiteID  1,2,3,4,5,6,7  BEGIN  exec uspfunctiontest SiteID  select  from udfrptmultivalueparamtotableSiteID,,,1  END codepre  pstrongOutput from Procedurestrongp  precodeVal  1 codepre  pstrongOutput from select statementstrongp  precodeVal  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 codepre  pstrongFunction Codestrongp  precodeCREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[udfRPTMultiValueParamToTAble]             String VARCHARmax,  input string     Delimeter char1,    delimiter     TrimSpace bit        kill whitespace  RETURNS Table TABLE  [Val] VARCHAR4000  AS  BEGIN     DECLARE Val    VARCHAR4000     WHILE LENString gt 0     BEGIN         SET Val     LEFTString,              ISNULLNULLIFCHARINDEXDelimeter, String  1, 1,              LENString         SET String  SUBSTRINGString,              ISNULLNULLIFCHARINDEXDelimeter, String, 0,              LENString  1, LENString   IF TrimSpace  1 Set Val  LTRIMRTRIMVal     INSERT INTO Table  [Val]          VALUES  Val      END     RETURN END codepre  pstrongTest Procedure Codestrongp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE uspfunctiontest SiteID varchar AS  SET NOCOUNT ON  BEGIN  select  from udfrptmultivalueparamtotableSiteID,,,1  END codepre

Negative 60724 pIs there a way to make a UIStepper count by 5s rather than a single increment at a time i.e, tap  and a label says 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. or subtract by 5 every time So far I have tried codevalue 5code and that doesnt work. Any help is gladly appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 60724 pI am thinking of making a loop to gather all my POST variables and assign them to dynamically named variables.Something like this not testedp  precode fori i lt POST[].length i   POST[i]  POST[i]    codepre  pBut I am wondering about the security of something like this. This would then create a variable in the system for every bit of post data sent to the page. Can that variable be damaging even if the script I write doesnt reference it Is this the type of thing I should avoid entirely I have some pages that send quite a few variables and a script like this would prevent a whole lot of writing, but is it safe enoughp

Negative 60724 pYes, Im a noob at Xcode. right now Im working my way through the Big Nerd Ranch IOS programming book, and I just need a little clarification on the ModleViewController bit.p  pModel class is called CellData, an NSObject  View class  CellView, a UIView  Controller class is called CellAppDelegate, a UIResponder.p  pThe DrawRect method does a lot of drawing, with colors based upon the data from the CellData Class. Everything so far emseemsem tells me that I should not call a CellData method from my CellView class. Normally yeah when your just using UIButtons with TestFields, yeah, makes perfect sense. p  pIn this case, I have up to pass a value from CellData to CellView up to 6000 times to refresh a View. Does it still make sense to keep on calling back and forth between using the CellAppDelegate seems like a lot more work for the computer, or am I really allowed to retrieve a value from CellData p
Negative 60724 pI was following this a hrefhttpvim.wikia.comwikiCcodecompletion relnofollowhttpvim.wikia.comwikiCcodecompletionap  pAt some point it says that when you type something like std A box opens with suggestions.p  pIn my case as soon as I type std I get a message in the bar at the bottom Omni Completion ONP Pattern not foundp  pThis may as well be a mess because no tutorial explains where things go in Windows.p  pFor example before I can install OmniCompletion, I have to install ctags. How I have no idea. At some point I read that I only need ctags.exe under windows. But where do I put it I figured out to put it in the mingwbin directory since it was already in the path.p  pAnd it seems to work. Though when I press C12 instead of indexing the current file, it seems to start indexing my whole home directory in Windows.p  pEvery time I opened a .cpp file it kept saying Pattern not found.p  pI eventually figured out that it works IF I edit a specific file by right clicking on it, and pick edit with Vim from the menu. If instead I launch Vim from its shortcut and THEN open a .cpp file, OmniCompletion fails.p  pThe reason seems to be that edit with Vim gives the program the correct working directory, but if I then open a file that exists somewhere else, OmniCompletion stops working and says it cant find anything.p  pSo, under Windows, what is that tells Vim in which directory to operate, so that I can edit properly different files no matter where they are, and no matter how I opened Vim in the first placep  pAnd how can I run ctags so that it does its job in the current directory where the active file is, instead of wherever it randomly pleasesp

Negative 60724 pIm trying to render to two textures with one pass using C directx 11 SDK. I want one texture to contain the color of each pixel of the result image what I normally see on the screen when rendering a 3D scene, and another texture to contain the normal of each pixel and depth 3 float for normal and 1 float for depth. Right now, what I can think of is to create two rendering targets and render the first pass as the colors and the second pass the normals and depth to each rendering target respectively. However, this seems a waste of time because I can get the information of each pixels color, normal, and depth in the first pass. So is there a way to somehow output two textures with the pixel shaderp  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pP.S. Im thinking something along the lines of RWTexture2D or RWStructuredBuffer in the pixel shader. A little background I will need the two images for further processing in the compute shader. Which brings up a side question of synchronization since the pixel shader unlike the compute shader writes each pixel one at a time, how would I know when the pixel shader is finished and tell the compute shader to start image postprocessingp

Negative 60724 pIm running magento with a custom template. I have been trying for the past week to enlarge the image size of the new product widget whether grid or list to be 232px width and 280px length. I have successfully located the newgrid.phtml and newlist.phtml files at appdesignfrontendbasedefaulttemplatecatalogproductwidgetnewcontent. I have also changed the images sizes from I think 85px width and 85px length to my desired 232px width by 280px length. Instead of enlarging the frame of the image and the image itself, the image seems to be enlarged but the frame remains the same at 85px 85px. So then you are only able to see a small portion of the image within the 85px by 85px image frame.  The widget Im talking about is the new product widget that you can insert from the CMS pages. Im running magento community edition 1.7p  pHeres the code snippet for the newgrid.phtml. Any help is appreciated.

Negative 60724 pI have created a C assembly that does 3DES encryptionencryption and tested it.

Most of the examples I have found so far require importing session keys. Im not using those.

What he really means is that we should try to avoid debugging on the hardware page 41.

Maybe we can pick some cases that couldnt be fully tested in simulator and then test it with real devices.p  pThank you for all your comments p

Negative 60724 pUsually, when designing a convolutional encoder for a transmitter, some sort of termination mechanism is applied to drive the encoder back to its zerostate after a message was transmitted. This is often done by appending a tail sequence to the transmitted message, e.g. a certain number n of zeros in case of a convolutional encoder without feedback. This way it takes n clock cylces to return the encoder to the all zero sate.br On the other hand, e.g. when implementing a convolutional encoder in HDL, this reset to the zero state could also be achieved by simply resetting all shiftregisters of the encoder. That way the zero state could be reached after only one clock cycle.br In the literature I never saw anyone mention the second method and was wondering what the reason for this could bep

Negative 60724 pI have an ajax, jQuery and PHP scripting that returns more data from a database as I scroll down infinite scroll until more data is in the database. The thing is that each data is placed into a div with a unique id, but only the initial content loaded when the page is entered for the first time appears in the HTML source. Once the more content is displayed, none of if appears in the HTML source code.p  pAnyone knows how to get to the ids of the divs that are loaded on scroll I need like an explanation of whats going on. p  pthx p
Negative 60724 pWere experiencing an issue in LittleProxy where OutOfMemoryErrors are popping up when reading from a fast server LittleProxy is proxying access to and writing to a slow client configured to use the proxy. The problem is that the data coming in from the server buffers up in memory faster than we can write it to the client. LittleProxy is just a simple HTTP proxy built atop Netty.p  pIs there any easy way to throttle the read from the remote server to be exactly the same speed as the client is able to read itp  pSeep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comadamfiskLittleProxyissues53 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comadamfiskLittleProxyissues53ap  pandp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comadamfiskLittleProxy relnofollowhttpsgithub.comadamfiskLittleProxyap

Negative 60724 pAs I understand it normal C code is translated into assembler at compile time, which is then executed by the CPU at runtime. So I do not quite understand what the fuss is with the advantages of template metaprogrammingp  pWikipedia says the following about template metaprogrammingp  blockquote   pTemplate metaprogramming is a metaprogramming technique in which   templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code,   which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and   then compiled. The output of these templates include compiletime   constants, data structures, and complete functions. The use of   templates can be thought of as compiletime execution.p blockquote  pThis didnt really seem to emphasise the advantages of template metaprogramming to me... p  pIm asking because I am interested in what template metaprogramming could do for optimizingimproving efficiency of low latency C applications. I have probably not understood something correctly along the way, so please feel free to correct my understanding.p

Ok Ill accept that and put the txt there, so I clean and build. Now if I run in netbeans the green arrow button it runs fine even if there is no txt file in my build folder, which seems strange BUT of course if I try to execute directly the jar in the dist folder which should be the thing you want to distribute once the project is finished the program fails since there is no txt folder inside the jar ofr next to it.p  pOk so I change my strategy and go for the thing which seemed logical, that is put my txt inside the src directory. When I build it appears in the build directory, and also inside the jar. p  pBUT the program fails both within netbeans and outside since the path to the file is not proper in the new File command. So I could change and type p  precodepublic class Test      public static void mainString[] args          try             File f  new Filesrcmyfile.txt             Scanner s  new Scannerf             System.out.printlns.next                  catchException e             e.printStackTrace                codepre  pbut now of course it wont run outside netbeans because the src folder does not mean anything to the poor .jar file.p  pI cant find a way to address this supposedly trivial task. p  pCan you help mep

Negative 60724 pI have the typical example, where a POST has many TAGS, and a TAG has many POSTs. Instead of using a typical codeManyToManycode, I use a domain object in the middle, called TAGPOST, which also allows me to have useful data in there, such as when a post was tagged with a given tag, etc. Each POST, and TAG resp, is in a codeOneToManycode relationship with a TAGPOST.p  pThe specific requirement is that a post cannot have the same tag included twice, therefore the TAGPOST.post and TAGPOST.tag pair must always be unique. Normally, I would do that by making a  composite primary key pair in the table, responsible for storing TAGPOST objects. p  pAFAIK, there is no way to express this unique constraint. I have marked codejpa.ddlupdatecode, which means that every time I move the application to a new environment, I will have to go and manually fix this in the DB. This is very inconvenient, and error prone, especially when unit testing, because then the database is created and dropped more or less in every iteration. p  pI was even thinking to do the check manually on codePrePersistcode, or even move the check in a business layer, say, create a PostService.p  pWhat do I do Am I missing something that Play has by default Some clever annotation to express the uniqueness of the codeManyToOnecode properties of the TAGPOST classp  pFYI I am using Play 1.2.5p  pEDIT The TAGPOST class looks like thisp  precodeEntity public class TagPost extends Model       ManyToOne     public Tag tag      ManyToOne     public Post post      public Date dateAdded      ...  codepre

Negative 60724 pEvery now and again I find myself building a feature and completely doubting whether my approach makes sense or is entirely out of whack. I was hoping somebody might be able to verify my strategy here.p  pIm building a system that notifies users via email that certain actions have been taken within the site like comments, posts, etc. I currently have a model called ActionEvent which tracks all of these interactions. Anytime a user posts a comment, for example, a new ActionEvent is created which documents that action who posted it, what it was posted to, and the context. Ideally, when these action events are created, I would also want to send out a notification by email. There are tons of events that warrant emails, and events frequently cause more than just one person to be notified.p  pThings get a little hairy at this point, because I dont necessarily want to flood peoples inboxes with emails if, say, someone posts three comments in 5 five minutes. So I decided to build an actioneventemail model to track all the emails that have been sent, and for what reason. The idea is that before any emails are sent, the system will check the previously sent emails to make sure that no emails of a particular type were sent to a particular user within an acceptable timeframe before delivering the email. Does this make sense, or am I missing something really obvious here Im worried that once I build this infrastructure its going to be rather difficult to modify down the line. p  pHas anyone done this before And if so, how did you do itp  pThanksp

Negative 60724 pIm currently working on some highperformance, stabilitycritical frameworks, which will likely deploy on x8664, ia64, and potentially ARM platforms. The library is so far done in C. The current standard is C99, though we are interested in experimenting with features of C11.p  pInitially, the choice to avoid C was because we wanted to prevent developers from using classes due to their inherent inefficiencies, such as larger memory footprints, vtables, and inheritance. We also wanted to keep structs free of member functions. In other words, C was chosen over C deliberately to prevent to use of certain features in C.p  pHowever, we recently did a doubletake after further investigating some of Cs features.

Negative 60724 pI have to create a MySQL InnoDB table using a strictly sequential ID to each element in the table row. There cannot be any gap in the IDs  each element has to have a different ID and they HAVE TO be sequentially assigned. Concurrent users create data on this table.p  pI have experienced MySQL autoincrement behaviour where if a transaction fails, the PK number is not used, leaving a gap. I have read online complicated solutions that did not convince me and some other that dont really address my problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3292197emulateautoincrementinmysqlinnodbEmulate autoincrement in MySQLInnoDBa, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15766366settingmanualincrementvalueonsynchronizedmysqlserversSetting manual increment value on synchronized mysql serversap  ul liI want to maximise writing concurrency. I cant afford having users writing on the table and waiting long times.li liI might need to shard the table... but still keeping the ID count.li liThe sequence of the elements in the table is NOT important, but the IDs have to be sequential ie, if an element is created before another does not need to have a lower ID, but gaps between IDs are not allowed.li ul  pThe only solution I can think of is to use an additional COUNTER table to keep the count. Then create the element in the table with an empty ID not PK and then lock the COUNTER table, get the number, write it on the element, increase the number, unlock the table. I think this will work fine but has an obvious bottle neck during the time of locking nobody is able to write any ID. Also, is a single point of failure if the node holding the table is not available.

Negative 60724 pAdmittedly, Ive seen this question on here a few times  but all the answers seem to solve their problems by using a codeGROUP BYcode or a codeWHEREcode, so I was curious how to get around this if your query is getting too large where that wouldnt work.p  pFor example, Im writing something that uses two left joins to my main table, bringing the overlaps over into the results. As Im still relatively new to SQL, Im not exactly sure whats doing it  but I know that Im getting an extra thousand or so people when I run the counts Im imagining this is the case because there are duplicate IDs for each person purposefully in the two tables Im joining.p  pAll my queries populating the results I want to get for this project is using codeCOUNTcode or codeSUMcode pending on the column. Is there a way that I can use codeDISTINCTcode to make only one column at a time treat my IDs only as one Based on what Ive done so far, Ive noticed that whenever you set codeDISTINCTcode it works beyond just the one column youre trying to attribute it to.

Negative 60724 pI inherited some node.js code that I clearly have no idea how it works.  The issue I have is its opening database connections and not closing or reusing them.

Negative 60724 pI am creating a custom interfacescreen in java. Part of this interfacescreen takes a given image and then chops it up into a given number of sections randomly and then draws them on the screen with slight movements. Over the top of this is drawn an overlay which blots out most of what is going on underneath. This was obviously very inefficient as much of what was being drawn could not be seen and I thought it was causing the interfacescreen to stall briefly when first start. I amended the code so that only the sections that can be seen through the overlay are drawn expecting this to fix the problem of slow down at start up but it hasnt.p  pWhen I print out the timings for my draw loop the first three times are high about 500ms, then 300ms, then 20ms and the rest are a stable 16ms or 60 fps for the rest of the time.p  pIs there anything else that might be causing this slow down at the start Is it possible that java is somehow optimising my drawing in those first 1000 or so ms so that it can run at 16ms for the rest of the time Like realising that some of whats being drawn cant be seen and then optimising so it isnt actually drawn every update  I dont really know Im sort of out of ideas as to what could be causing this.p  pIve checked thoroughly to make sure no objectsthreadsassets are being loaded once the update starts, this is the only thing I can think of.p  pAny help greatly appreciated.p

Negative 60724 pI have a large list of java objects that all inherit from one shared object and each contains many field members properties. However, not all fields on all of the objects are guaranteed to be initialized. There are also fields that are contained in the super class which should be included as well.

Negative 60724 pAs I have been led to believe, the vast majority of web apps use a single database login credential, typically hardcoded into the app code itself or a secured config file. Application logic and sessions take care of managing user interaction with the database the database remains ignorant of who is doing what.p  pHowever, I would like to take advantage of codeMySQLs currentusercode  triggers to perform certain database actions specific to the individual user.  This requires that users make database connections with their unique MySQL credentials. Because the codePASSWORDcode hashed codeMySQL passwordcode cannot be used to make connections, it is required that the app 1 stores the users MySQL pwd in clear text in a DB table or codeACL filecode, and 2 stores it in clear text in the session, to be used when making connections.  That is not ideal.  p  pIs there a better, more secure approach for doing thisp

Negative 60724 pI have a Django app with two types of users, lets call them A and B. The two user types have different navigation bars. User type A has a link in their navigation bar to allow them to send a message. The send message form comes up in an overlay, so the form needs to be present in every template, or fetched over AJAX. These users can send a message from anyevery page on the site, and each page has its own view. If a message has errors, users should be returned to the same page they were on, and errors should be shown in the form overlay. If it is sent successfully, they should be redirected to a new page that shows their message.p  pCurrently, I have put the form into a separate template that is included on all pages for user type A. I specified the form action as a view called sendmessage, and I have told that view to render to this template. The view is never called, so I guess this isnt the right way to do it.p  pHow can I render this form in every template Do I need to call a function from each view, or use a special template tag I looked at inclusion tags, but I dont think theyre right for this situation Or should I fetch the form using AJAX Do I add the form view to every URLp  pEDIT Adding some code to explain.p  pSay, for example, I am on a page with a simple view like thisp  precodeloginrequired def indexviewrequest, placeid     categories  Category.objects.all     return renderrequest, placescategories.html, placeid placeid, categories categories codepre  pThe template for this page is extended from a template with the nav bar in it, and that template includes the send a message form, which looks like thisp  precodeltdiv idmessagepopupgt     lth1gtNewMessagelth1gt         ltform action url sendmessage  methodpostgt              csrftoken               getmessageform as messageform              lttablegt                 lttrgt                     lttdgt messageform.recipient.labeltag  messageform.recipient ltspangtlttdgt                     lttdgt messageform.title.labeltag  messageform.title lttdgt                 lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttdgt messageform.categories.labeltag  messageform.categories lttdgt                 lttdgt                      messageform.content.labeltag  messageform.content                      ltbutton typesubmit classbuttongtSendltbuttongt                     ltbutton classboxclose buttongtCancelltbuttongt                 lttdgt             lttrgt         lttablegt     ltformgt ltdivgt codepre  pThat form posts to this viewp  precodedef sendmessageviewrequest, placeid     place  Place.objects.getidplaceid     if request.POST            user  getuserclassrequest.user         messageform  forms.SendMessageFormrequest.POST, placeplace, useruser         if messageform.isvalid             messageform.save              redirect to page showing the message     else         messageform  forms.SendMessageFormplaceplace, useruser     return renderrequest, messagingsendmessageform.html, messageform messageform codepre  pThe step Im missing is how to get the form to render in the first place.

Negative 60724 pI came across to a problem regarding Twigs escaping in Symfony2.p  h2The problemh2  pIm currently using Symfonys form builder to create a form for managing the categories of my project.

Negative 60724 pSay you design for a normal screen4 inch of hdpi density, but then when you see it on a large screen7 inch of hdpi density the icons are too small.  Initially what I did was have to create a folder drawablelargehdpi, then take the icons from xhdpi and copy it in there.  It seemed to work well, but then when I came across a large xhdpi screen it caused problems because Android was looking in the drawablelargehdpi first before looking in drawablexhdpi folder, because large has precedence. Creating another folder drawablelargexhdpi and copying files seems inefficient as you have to do this for the ever expanding dpi screens. p  pSo rather than having wrapcontent on your icons inside the app should you be setting a particular widthheight e.g. layoutwidthheightdimeniconsize, then in the dimensions.xml set different widths in the values and valueslarge folderp  pIt would be nice if one could set it as a percentage of the parent view, but layoutweight only works for certain scenarios of linearlayoutsp  pAre there better approaches.p

Negative 60724 pIm hoping someone can explain why searching a list of object references is so much slower than searching a normal list. This is using the python in keyword to search which I thought runs at C compiler speed. I thought a list is just an array of object references pointers so the search should be extremely fast. Both lists are exactly 412236 bytes in memory.p  pNormal list takes 0.000 seconds to searchp  precodealist  [a for x in range100000] if b in alist     printFound codepre  pList of object references takes 0.469  seconds to searchp  precodeclass Spam     pass spamlist  [Spam for x in range100000] if Spam in spamlist     printFound codepre  phr Edit So apparently this has something to do with oldstyle classes having way more overhead than new style classes.

Just when I thought I knew Python.brbr Ive read about newstyle vs oldstyle before but it was never mentioned that oldstyle classes can be up to 100x slower than new style ones. What is the best way to search a list of object instances for a particular instancebr 1. Keep using the in statement but make sure all classes are new style.br 2. Perform some other type of search using the is statement likep  precode[obj for obj in spamlist if obj is target] codepre  p3. Some other more Pythonic wayp

Negative 60724 pIm currently developing an android app which uses navigation tabs on the homescreen.  Tab 1 contains a list fragment which is populated over an async task.

It was easyp  precodemenuhover  backgroundcolor blue width 90  codepre  pThere is no problem untill here. I need the same effect on  focus. There is no way in css to change parent css on child focus neither hover by the way, but it is not needed, cuase i can use the entire menu hover. So i used a scriptp  precodevar menubuttonfocus  document.getElementsByClassNamemenubutton   for i0 iltmenubuttonfocus.length i      menubuttonfocus[i].addEventListenerfocus, function        menu.style.backgroundColor  blue       menu.style.width  90          menubuttonfocus[i].addEventListenerblur, function        menu.style.backgroundColor  transparent       menu.style.width  8         codepre  pThe script works just fine, the problem is that when you trigger those events by focusing a button, the css of menuhover changes somehow and menu does not change when hovering. I tried to solve this by doing something similar but with hover instead of focusp  precodemenu.addEventListenermouseenter, function       menu.style.backgroundColor  blue       menu.style.width  90      menu.addEventListenermouseout, function       menu.style.backgroundColor  transparent       menu.style.width  8    codepre  pThis works somehow, but it is REALLY buggy. I tried also to select menuhover,menufocus, but it doesnt work because the focus is on the button elements and not in menu. Please avoid jquery if posible, and i know its asking for too much but a pure css solution would be awesome. Probably helpful info html element are created dinamically with javascript.

Negative 60724 pI have several years experience with VBA in MS Office applications for automation and ETL processes but have not had the need to mess with Forms in MS Access until recently. Im laying out the design for some simple data extraction forms for a database I have designed and am hung up on what seems to be a simple task.p  pObjective I need a datasheet subform to display the records returned from a dynamically built SQL statement from controls on the main form.p  pOn my main form, I have a button that when a user clicks it the button will compile the information specified by the user in other user form controls into a SQL query, and then run that query so that a subform displays the resulting records.p  pNo matter what I do, I cannot get this to work. I keep getting most of the time anyway the microsoft visual basic runtime error 2467 The expression you entered refers to an object that is closed or doesnt exist. Thats the error I get with the code shown below. I cant figure out if I somehow need to initiate the subform as soon as any code gets run or what. Ive tried some other variations of code that have also not worked from other code forums, but I seem to have found several forum threads including some on Stack Overflow that suggest the code I have below should work.p  pThe attached image shows what the basic main form looks like. I have labeled the button that the user would click btnDisplaySWData to compile the SQL that gets create from yettobeincluded controls, but that is not the issue. Im just hardcoding a SQL statement as shown in the code snippet in trying to figure out this issue. As mentioned I want the records to display in the subform named dataDisplaySubform. JUNK is a table in the Access database that I can legitimately query with the SQL code below that I am just using for testing purposes until I figure this out.

In my case, assigning the Source Object to a form was not the correct solution which is what HansUp was suggesting. Instead a saved query seems to get it to do what I want.p  pNot sure if there is a better way to do this, but it seems like you need to set up a dummy, almost placeholder query, so you can set the subform Source Object to it in VBA.  A placeholder query like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM JUNK WHERE JUNK.agencyID  codepre  pThe above Access query is saved as the name TESTQUERY. It doesnt display anything, but satisfies the need to have Source Object assigned to something, essentially instantiating the subform when looking at the main form in form view. So, with the placeholder saved query, you can then reassign the RecordSource to whatever SQL String is put together via user interface controls on the main form, like thisp  precodePublic Sub btnDisplaySWDataClick     Dim pSQL As String     pSQL  SELECT JUNK.agencyID, JUNK.agencydesc FROM JUNK     Me.dataDisplaySubform.SourceObject  Query.TESTQUERY     Me.dataDisplaySubform.Form.RecordSource  pSQL     Me.dataDisplaySubform.Requery End Sub codepre  pwhich when the Form is in production, the shown hardcoded SQL statement stored in the pSQL string variable will be put together via user input on controls on the main form.p  pSo now, when the btnDisplaySWData is clicked, it does what I was trying to do and displays records. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh1UUr.png altenter image description herep

Negative 60724 pI am creating a Java function that needs to use a SQL query with a lot of joins before doing a full scan of its result. Instead of hardcoding a lot of joins I decided to create a view with this complex query. Then the Java function just uses the following query to get this resultp  precodeSELECT  FROM VW codepre  pSo the program is working fine but I want to make it faster since this codeSELECTcode command is taking a lot of time. After taking a look on its plan execution plan I created some indexes and made it 30 faster but I want to make it faster. p  pThe problem is that every operation in the execution plan have cost between 0 and 4 except one operation, a clusteredindex insert that has 50 of the execution cost. I think that the system is using a temporary table to store the views data, but an index in this view isnt useful for me because I need all rows from it.p  pSo what can I do to optimize that insert in the codeCWTPrimaryKeycode I think that I cant turn off that index because it seems to be part of the SQL Servers internals. I read somewhere that this operation could appear when you use cursors but I think that I am not using or does the view use it. p  pThe command to create the view is something simple no TSQL, no OPTION, etc likep  precodecreate view VW as SELECTS AND JOINS HERE codepre  pAnd here is a picture of the problematic part from the execution plan a hrefhttpimgur.comPO0ZnBU relnofollowhttpimgur.comPO0ZnBUap  pstrongEDIT More detailsstrongp  pWell the query to create the problematic view is a big query that join a lot of tables. Based on a single parameter the JavaClient modifies the query string before creating it. This view represents a data unit from a legacy Database migrated to the SQLServer that didnt had any Foreign or Primary Key, so our team choose to follow this strategy. Because of that the view have more than 50 columns and it is made from the join of other seven views.p  pMain views query with a lot of Portuguese words a hrefhttppastebin.comJh5vQxzA relnofollowhttppastebin.comJh5vQxzAap  pThe other views from VWSintese1 until VWSintese7 are created like this one but without using extra views, they just use joins with the tables that contain the data requested by the main view.p  pThen the Java Client create a prepared Statement with the query Select  from VWSintese and execute it using the function ExecuteQuery, something likep  precodeString query  Select  from VWSintese PreparedStatement ps  myConn.prepareStatementquery,ResultSet.TYPESCROLLINSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCURREADONLY ResultSet rs  ps.executeQuery codepre  pAnd then the program goes on until the end.p  pThanks for the attention.p

Negative 60724 pI am creating a physics simulator of sorts and I have thousands of pointlike objects single pixels moving at the same time.  The way I have this setup currently is each point moving only one pixel per frame, which makes it easy to keep track of them in a two dimensional array and check if theyre going to collide. However, this solution doesnt permit frame independent movement, which is necessary, because the collision detection is very slow. What is the most efficient way of doing collision detection in this case p

Negative 60724 pI am working on a small school project using oracle database. I have created some tables and two of them are Mobile MobileNumber,StatusFlag StatusFlag shows if a number is active or not and there is another table OwnerMobileOwnerId FK,MobileID FK. Now I should write a Constraint that prohibits the insert operation if the corresponding StatusFlag is N for the specified number. I tried to make it using sub query but this is not possible.p  pthe constrain should be applied to OWNERMOBILE table of course. For example if I say INSERT INTO OWNERMOBILE25541,042536 the constrain should check the Mobile table and see if the Mobile 042536 is active or not . If the number is not active the insert statement should generate a errorp

Negative 60724 pIm new in the area of Fortran programming and after testing a few programs I already got a feeling of how to write programs. Now I was trying me on a bit harder program and I run into a problem I couldnt solve by myself. I already googled about the problem but I couldnt find an adequate answer ... So I thought maybe there are one or two Fortran programmers which can give me a hand in solving this problem.p  pThe program is very simple it just multiplies two matrices with each other. I was trying to write a function which performs the task and returns the result matrix back to the invoker. To make the program a bit more dynamic I used dynamic arrays where the user can specify the dimension the matrices should have. The program looks like thisp  precodeprogram matrixMul implicit none integer, parameter  ikindselectedintkind18 integerkindikind, allocatable, dimension,  m1, m2, result, mulMatrix integer  rows, cols, i, j  print , Please enter the number of rows the matrix should have  read , rows  print , Please enter the number of columns the matrix should have  read , cols  allocate sufficient memory allocatem1rows, cols, m2cols, rows  fill matrixes with numbers entered by the user call fillMatrixm1, rows, cols call fillMatrixm2, cols, rows  result  mulMatrixm1, m2, rows, cols  prints the result matrix to the screen call printMatrixresult, rows, cols  deallocate memory deallocatem1, m2, mulMatrix, result end program matrixMul codepre  pWhere the function which performs the actual multiplication looks like thisp  precodefunction mulMatrixm1, m2, r, c resultmulMat implicit none integer, parameter  ikindselectedintkind18 integerkindikind, dimensionr, c  m1 integerkindikind, dimensionc, r  m2 integerkindikind, allocatable, dimension,  mulMat integer r, c, i, j, k  allocatemulMatr,r  code which performs calculation is omitted  end function mulMatrix codepre  pMy compiler reports the following errorp  blockquote   pError Array index at 1 is an array of rank 2p blockquote  pFor me it seems as the compiler would treat the variable mulMatrix as an usual array and therefore complains about it because I use it as it would have four dimensions which isnt the case. But how can I make the compiler think of this variable as a function call with four parameters instead of an array access Any help would be appreciate.p
Negative 60724 pI am trying to build an ansible playbook to configure a ubuntu vagrant box. The playbook is pretty much working with the exception of controlling the ubuntu box reboot after upgrading the kernel.p  pI have a host file for ansible as follow p  precodelocalhost ansibleconnectionlocal dockerhost ansiblesshport2222 ansiblesshhost127.0.0.1 codepre  pThe latest iteration I tried to solve this problem is as follow p  precode   name Restart the server     shell sleep 2s ampamp reboot amp executablebinbash     name Wait until the virtual machine stop ie ssh port stop responding     localaction waitfor hostansiblesshhost portansiblesshport statestopped     sudo false     name Wait for server to come up     localaction waitfor hostansiblesshhost portansiblesshport delay30     sudo false codepre  pWith this playbook steps the process block waiting for the ssh port to stop responding, until it reach timeout and exit the playbook, I am guessing that if the reboot is particularly fast it might happen in between the polling intervals of the waitfor command and miss the short time when the ssh port is actually down. The error returned by ansible is p  blockquote   pfailed [dockerhost]  elapsed 300, failed true msg Timeout   when waiting for 127.0.0.12222 to stop.p blockquote  pAt least once it managed the get to the step where ansible wait for the ssh port to be available again but hung there until timing out. I think this solution is too sensitive to difference in reboot speed, which can vary widely in a virtual environment. The ansible version I am using is 1.5.3 Ubuntu is 12.04lte with a Kernel upgrade to 3.8 The complete playbook install docker and all dependencies.p  pI tried many variations and ideas found in various web sites but never managed to properly control a reboot and continue my playbook with the next steps.p  pI am looking for a simple and fool proof way of rebooting the server and continuing with the next steps in a playbook once the machine is back up and runningp  pI have not explored the possibility of running a local vagrant reload because I want to use this same playbook in operation where I will not be running vagrant, I only mentioned vagrant in case it creates some complexities that I am not aware of. I also dont want to just pause 5 minutes and hope for the server to be up again, the point of using this kind of tools is to provision servers in a predictable and timely manner and to be portable from environment to environment, a pause just does not seem right.p  pI have also looked around for an ansible module that would manage this requirement but comments on the ansible web site seem to rule this out.p  pThanksp

What changed that is no longer worksp  pstrongUpdate 4214strongp  pI have tried this in every way of giving the filefolder location to system events and it doesnt work. I am glad it is just not me who cannot get it to work. I will update this post if I find an answer or a working update is made.p  pstrongUpdate 4314strongp  pIt seems this is just a bug that system events cant move files. I have reported it here a hrefhttpbugreport.apple.com relnofollowhttpbugreport.apple.coma and everyone else should too. p  pPlease do not take my code to heart, it is just where things ended up when I couldnt get it to work. I have working code for 10.8.5 and it is what is shown above minus the folder tag in the system events tell block. No idea why it works with out the folder tag but it does. Tested on multiple comps. If it isnt broken dont fuss over it. Noted it and moved on.p  pstrongUpdate 102014strongp  pFor anyone interested. I have received an email stating my ticket has been closedresolved.

Negative 60724 pI dont know how to hide a progress bar which I have in a codengrepeatcode.

I want to show that codedivcode when the user clicks on a button.p  pHow can I do this thank youp  pDaniel.p  hr  pEdit. To be honest, I didnt do it what I asked above because  I expected other behavior of   AngularJS  but Ive written now what I wanted on Plunker and it works. p  pWhat I wanted is simplifying two columns one column with a button and the other one with a progress bar. If I clic on the button of that row, its progress bar is showed. I thought AngujarJS would show ALL progress bars because all bars have the same tag nghidebar, for example and for that reason I opened this question.

Negative 60724 pI have the following scenariop  pOn one PC I have SQL db where the owner is local user e.g. xyz. This db has a lot of users and they all are domain user. Now I have to make a copy of the db on another PC. Im planning to backup it up and restore on the second computer. I think that domain users will be OK but local user xyz likely will not be OK because  is different and etc. p  pMy question is how could I change it and make xyz valid on the second PC Could I delete this user and create a new one with correct  and likely assign ownership and roles it had on the first PCp  pI have to do this procedure on 5 PC and Im thinking of a way to save time  and it came to my mind that backuprestore would be the best and simple approach ... but I am concern about local user.p  pThanks p

I was wondering if there is a way to preload it such that there doesnt need to be a delay before the button is pressed and so that the error wont exist, thanksp  prelevant pieces of code are listed, but since the entire package has a few thousand lines Im not going to put all of it herep  pThis is ran in the main method.p  precodePanels panel  new Panels  panel.getWindow codepre  pThis is in a separate Window classp  precodepublic WindowJPanel panel      superKnight Quest     loading screen     JWindow window  new JWindow     window.getContentPane.addnew JLabelLoading...     window.getContentPane.add             new JLabel, new ImageIcongetClass.getResourceloading.gif, SwingConstants.CENTER     window.setBounds600, 300, 400, 300     window.setVisibletrue     try               Thread.sleep2500      catch InterruptedException e               e.printStackTrace          window.setVisiblefalse     end of loading screen     setLayoutnew BorderLayout     addpanel, BorderLayout.CENTER     setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     setSize600,550     setLocation525, 225     setVisibletrue   codepre  pThis is at the top of the Panel classp  precodeprivate Window window  new Windowmain      codepre  pThis is the main JPanel that starts off the program just adds stuff to a JPanelp  precodepublic JPanel main      JPanel main  new JPanel     check  main     main.setBackgroundlightGrey     Handler handles  new Handler      one  new JButtonStart      two  new JButtonPatch Notes     three  new JButtonExit         one.addActionListenerhandles     two.addActionListenerhandles     three.addActionListenerhandles      image   new ImageIcongetClass.getResourcetemplar.jpg      JLabel title  new JLabelKnight Quest     title.setFontnew FontSerif, Font.PLAIN, 45     JLabel mainPic  new JLabelimage     JLabel versionNum  new JLabelv1.1.0     JLabel credit  new JLabelCreated and developed by Joseph Torres      Box panel  Box.createVerticalBox     panel.addtitle     panel.addBox.createRigidAreanew Dimension50, 50     panel.addone     panel.addBox.createRigidAreanew Dimension50,50     panel.addtwo     panel.addBox.createRigidAreanew Dimension50,50     panel.addthree     panel.addBox.createRigidAreanew Dimension50,150     panel.addversionNum     panel.addcredit      main.addpanel     main.addmainPic     return main  codepre  pAnd the nullpointerexception is generated at p  precodeprivate class Handler implements ActionListener, KeyListener      public void actionPerformedActionEvent event              First Button         ifevent.getSource  one                      ifcheck.equalsmain                              window.setPanelprologue                                                      codepre  pand lastly setPanel is a a method made in the windows class that isp  precodepublic void setPanelfinal JPanel panel      SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable           Override         public void run              getContentPane.removeAll             addpanel, BorderLayout.CENTER             ifPanels.sizeCheck  1                              setSize600, 550                 setLocation525, 225                          else                              setSize1000, 600                 setLocation300, 100                          revalidate             repaint                codepre  pThis is already a huge wall of text, but those are all of the important pieces that I felt were relevant.

I want to implement postredirectget when entering the flow so that the browser address bar stays in sync with the view. So I naturally tried actionflow1facesredirecttrue. This change prevents the flow from executing.. it simply reloads index.xhtml when the button is clicked.p  pThen I tried actionflow1flow1.xhtmlfacesredirecttrue. This loads the page and redirects as expected, but the flow is not initialized. When I submit the form in the flow, I get an error about flowScope resolving to null.p  pDoing a little research, I found a tip to set the toflowdocumentid to force it to initialize the flow. So I added  to my commandbutton. No change.p  pAny ideas about how to accomplish thisp

Negative 60724 pEach Job in my system belongs to a specific userid and can be put in rabbitmq from multiple sources. My requirements p  ul liNo more than 1 job should be running per user at any given time.  li liJobs for other users should not experience any delay because of job piling up for a specific user.  li liEach Job should be executed at least once. Each Job will have a max retries count and is reinserted in queue or probably delayed with a delay if fails.  li liMaintaining Sequence of Jobs per user is desirable but not compulsory.  li liJobs should probably be persisted, as I need them executing atleast once. There is no expiry time of jobs.  li liAny of the  workers should be able to run jobs for any of the user.  li ul  pWith these requirements, I think maintaining a single queue for each individual user makes sense.

But when I drop the layout within the RichTextArea y want to get the Text written in this area and add some text but the method richText.getValue is not updated unless I change the focus to another component or tab out. I guess there is not being communication with the server side so the value is not updated. Is there any way to force a a focus change when mousedown on the layout I tried with JavaScript but i dont know how to add a onmousedownfunction attribute to the layout component. I also tried extending RichTextArea and implementing the MouseListener or something or a TextChangeListener, but nothing works.p  pAny clue Thank you.p  pPS The component cannot be different from a RichTextArea.p

Negative 60724 pI am trying to design a new system for tracking sales. A simplistic version of my data models arep  precodepublic class Sale       public int SaleId  get set      public DateTime CompletedDateTime  get set       public virtual ListltSaleItemgt SaleItems  get set       public decimal Total             get                      return SaleItems.Sumi gt i.Price                  public class SaleItem       public int SaleItemId  get set      public decimal Price  get set      public int SaleId  get set      public virtual Sale Sale  get set    codepre  pI am now writing some reports which total the sales value for between a specified period. I have the following code to do thatp  precodeListltSalegt dailySales  db.Sales                           .Wherex gt DbFunctions.TruncateTimex.CompletedDateTime gt fromParam                           .Wherex gt DbFunctions.TruncateTimex.CompletedDateTime lt toParam                           .ToList  decimal total  dailySales.Sumx gt x.Total codepre  pThis is working ok and giving me the expected result. I feel like this might give me problems further down the line though once large datasets get involved. I assume having to load all the Sales into a list would become resource intensive, plus my actual implementation has tax, costs etc. associated with each SaleItem so again becomes more complex.p  pThe following would allow me to do all the processing on the database, however it is not possible to do this as the DB does not have a representation for Total, so EF throws an errorp  precodeDecimal total  db.Sales.Sumxgtx.Total codepre  pWhich leads me to my question. I could set me model as the following and each time I add a SaleItem, make sure I update the Totalp  precodepublic class Sale       ...         public decimal Total  get set   codepre  pThis would then allow me to query the database as required, and I assume will be less resource intensive. The flip side though is that I have reduced redundancy into the database. Is the latter way, the better method of dealing with this or is there an alternative method I havent even considered that is betterp

Negative 60724 pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow do I construct an AutoFac ContainerBuilder such that my subdependencies are correctly resolved assuming more than one concrete implementation of an interface  Default registrationresolve will not work because I have more than one concrete implementation of a subdependency, and the subdependency resolution is dependent on the resolution of the primary object.  In all cases I wish to use constructor injection.p  pstrongScenariostrongp  pFor example, lets say I need to print a receipt, so I create an interface called IReceipt, with one method, called PrintReceipt.p  pBut I need to print 3 kinds of receiptsp  ol liStandard Receiptli liGift Receiptli liEmail Receiptli ol  pAll receipt types have different formats, and the email receipt is not printed at all, rather it is emailed.  So I wish my IReceipt had the ability to depend on a formatter, and a processor.  Say I invent IProcessor, with the method Process, and it can either be a printer processor, or an email processor the printer processor has the responsibility of printer communications, and the email processor has the responsibility of communicating with the SMTP server.  Also, I create an IFormatter, and it can feed input to the processor object, formatted as a standard receipt, or a gift receipt, or even HTML for the email receipt.  So the constructor on any concrete implementation of an IReciept now requires two dependencies  an IFormatter, and an IProcessor.p  pNow, at the root composition I need to decide, am I resolving an IReceipt that is intended for a standard receipt, a Gift receipt, or an email receipt.  I would like to call the container Resolve method passing the necessary parameters so it will resolve the correct IReceipt.  Furthermore,  I would like the registration ContainerBuilder to know that if I attempt to resolve the IReceipt Standard Receipt concrete implementation that it needs to resolve subdepencies with the correct Standard Receipt IFormatter, and correct Standard Receipt IProcessor.  The same would hold true for the gift receipt scenario and the email receipt scenario.p  pstrongRecapstrongp  pSo  in all this  my question is  how do I construct the ContainerBuilder so subdependencies are defined at design time, and that a single call to Resolve will correctly identify the required concrete implementations  I am not seeking a solution to talk to a printer, or post HTML.  This question is strictly for the Autofac registration and resolution methodology.  At a different client, I have used this exact tactic using CastleWindsor but my current client is using Autofac.p

So, I decided to scale up my machine and use the largest instance I use r3 because my script was quite memory intensive however, it didnt process as fast as I assumed.p  pWhen I tried to monitor the CPU load watch n 5 uptime... I found out that the average CPU load never exceeds 9 even when I leave it running for some time.

However I think that the script tries to run as many jobs as it was instructed because when I terminate the process I would see something like... Process ForkPoolWorker30 and their tracebacks whips past the screenp  pFurther inspection with the ps x C python3.4 command yields that only 8 python processes are running. I deduced that this might be some kind of limitation from python or the OS I build my AMI using t2.micro instance which doesnt have many cores So, I decided to redo my work of rebuilt my environment from scratch including compiling Python using c3.4xlarge, and change the OS to Amazon Linux a branch of Fedora I think for the better compatibility with the hardware. p  pHowever, my script still never exceeded 8 cores. Finally, using demo text classification code from the Scikitlearn website a hrefhttpscikitlearn.orgstableautoexamplesgridsearchtextfeatureextraction.html relnofollowhttpscikitlearn.orgstableautoexamplesgridsearchtextfeatureextraction.htmla which use SGDClassifier instead of MultinomialNB It can run perfectly with all thirtytwo cores p  pSo... maybe, something to do with the grid search algorithm and Naive Bayes classifierp  pIm considering filing a bug, but would like to know first if this is an expected behavior of Naive Bayes or if Im doing something wrong with my codep  h2Updatesh2  pI cant find a way to test if the memory bandwidth has been the culprit directly. But I try to time my parallel code and CPU usage in various ways to find where, indeed, the bottleneck occurs.p  h2Experiment 1 perform only the vectorization and transformation.h2  pUsing my real data as input 150,000 text documents each contains roughly 130 wordsbr The parameters space is about 400.br Multithreading is done by Joblib the same module used by Scikitlearn. I gotbr Using 8 threads done in 841.017783164978 s and use 24.636999999999993  of CPU.br Using 16 threads done in 842.9525656700134 s and use 24.700749999999985  of CPU.br Using all 32 threads done in 857.024197101593 s and use 24.242250000000013  of CPU.  p  pThe result clearly indicates that the vectorization process is unable to scale as the processing power increases.p  h2Experiment 2 This time I perform only the MultinomialNB on the prevectorized data.h2  pUsing the parameters space of about 400 as before, I gotbr Using 8 threads done in 2102.0565922260284 s and use 25.486000000000054  of CPU.br Using 16 threads done in 1385.6887295246124 s and use 49.83674999999993  of CPU.br Using all 32 threads done in 1319.416403055191 s and use 89.90074999999997  of CPU.  p  pThe transition from 8 threads to 16 threads shows a huge improvement. However, as the number of threads increases to 32, the total time of completion gets only slightly shorter while the CPU usage increases substantially. This point I dont quite understand.p  h2Experiment 3 I combine the two processes together.h2  pUsing 8 threads done in 3385.3253166675568 s and use 25.68999999999995  of CPU.br Using 16 threads done in 2066.499200105667 s and use 49.359249999999996  of CPU.br Using all 32 threads done in 2018.8800330162048 s and use 54.55375000000004  of CPU.  p  pThere are some discrepancy between the time Ive got from my own parallel code and that of the GridsearchCV, but this could be because the simplification Ive done in my code Im not doing cross validation or full parameters iteration like in Gridsearchp  h2conclusionsh2  pFrom my test, I conclude that. And please correct me if Im wrongp  ol liThe vectorization phase use memory much more intensive thus, most likely to saturate the bandwidth. This can be observe from the time of completion and CPU utilization that it hits some kind of bottleneck and didnt scale. However, it was a relatively quick process. I eliminate IObound as all data is stored on RAM, and the memory usage during that time is about 30li liMultinomialNB uses memory less intensive than the vectorizer most of the computation seems to be processed incore. So, it can scale better than the vectorizer 8  16 but after that, it also hit some kind of bottle neck, and the MultinomialNB takes more time than the vectorizer.li liWhen combine two processes together, the completion time shows the same trend as MultinomialNB because, in my opinion, the memory bandwidth might be the bottleneck during the vectorization phase but that phase is relatively short compare to the MultinomialNB. So, if the number of concurrent tasks is low, it is possible to do those two phases together simultaneously and not saturate the bandwidth, but when the number of processes is high enough, there will be sufficient number of concurrent processes performing the vectorization to saturate the bandwidth thereby, forcing the operating system to reduce the running process. Explain only 89 running python process I found earlierli liIm not very sure but I think that the reason why SGDClassifier can use 100 CPU is because SGDClassifier has much longer incore processing time than the MultinomialNB. So, in each iteration, much of the time is devoted to compute SGDClassifier incore rather than doing vectorization, and the fact that SGDClassifier takes a long time to compute reduce the chance of many workers getting to the vectorization phase simultaneously as each vectorization task is relatively short but memory intensiveli ol  pI think my best bet now is to go for the cluster computing. p

Negative 60724 pIs there a proper explanation on how to add caching and ETAGIfNoneMatch support to RetrofitOkHttp Im struggling adding Etag support on 2 projects, and if at first I suspected that there might be an issue with HTTP Headers, another project has everything set correctly and caching still doesnt work as expected.p  pFollowing are my attempts to make it work. Results show that caching seems to be working within the same instance of the application, but as soon as I restart  everything loads long again. Also, in my logs I didnt see IfNoneMatch being added to a request, so I assume that server isnt aware of ETag and still recalculates the response completely.p  pHere are some code samplesp  ppublic class RetrofitHttpClient extends UrlConnectionClient p  precodeprivate OkUrlFactory generateDefaultOkUrlFactory      OkHttpClient client  new com.squareup.okhttp.OkHttpClient      try          Cache responseCache  new CachebaseContext.getCacheDir, SIZEOFCACHE         client.setCacheresponseCache      catch Exception e          Logger.logthis, e, Unable to set http cache           client.setConnectTimeoutREADTIMEOUT, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS     client.setReadTimeoutCONNECTTIMEOUT, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS     return new OkUrlFactoryclient   private final OkUrlFactory factory  public RetrofitHttpClient      factory  generateDefaultOkUrlFactory   Override protected HttpURLConnection openConnectionretrofit.client.Request request throws IOException      return factory.opennew URLrequest.getUrl  codepre  pp  pRest adapter is then created with FULL log level and a custom tagp  precoderestAdapter  new RestAdapter.Builder         .setClientnew RetrofitHttpClient         .setEndpointConfig.BASEURL         .setRequestInterceptornew SignatureSetter         .setConverternew JacksonConverterJsonHelper.getObjectMapper         .setLogLevelRestAdapter.LogLevel.FULL         .setLognew AndroidLogNETWORK         .build codepre  pI have a long request on the first screen of the app for testing. When I open the app  it takes 7 seconds to complete the request. If I pause and resume the app  same request takes 250ms, clearly hitting the cache.

Negative 60724 pI have decided to migrate an application in the architecture JPAEJBJSF toward JPASpringJSF.p  pDuring this migration to spring I have enabled CDI also. After the migration of all the layers I am at the level of the layer of the controllers. In Java EE I have annotated methods with codePostConstructcode which allow me to initialize variables,test configurations for the applied.These methods are running before before the settersgetters.p  pExample Java EE codep  precodeManagedBeannameclassecontroller SessionScoped public class ClasseController implements Serializable       private Etablissements etablissement     private Classe classe  new Classe     private Niveau niveau  new Niveau     private Personne currentUser      public ClasseController       PostConstruct     void initialiseSession          etablissement  new Etablissements          Etablissements testEtab  null         testEtab  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getSessionMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF         if testEtab  null              etablissement  testEtab          else              etablissement  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getApplicationMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF                    setter getters  codepre  pAfter migration on Spring I have read that the codePostConstructcode is only executed after the initialization of the beans in the context.Therefore I have found that my methods that should be executed at the start of my application no longer run during the opening of a web page using my controller.p  pI would like to know how I can implement this without too many changes to the codep  phere is the code Springp  precodeNamedclassecontroller SessionScoped public class ClasseController implements Serializable       private Etablissements etablissement     private Classe classe  new Classe     private Niveau niveau  new Niveau     private Personne currentUser      public ClasseController       PostConstruct     void initialiseSession          etablissement  new Etablissements          Etablissements testEtab  null         testEtab  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getSessionMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF         if testEtab  null              etablissement  testEtab          else              etablissement  Etablissements FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.getExternalContext.getApplicationMap.getGlobalFonctions.ETABACTIF                setter getters  codepre  pThanksp

Negative 60724 pI have a web service. I need to store and retrieve documents pdf, docx, etc.. I use latest stable versions of Ubuntu, Nginx and JVM. Clojure is my programming language. As I know Nginx can cache file system data very well. I would like to allow access for some files and restrict for others depending on a user or other web service rules. For example I can allow access to a file and then restrict it for some time and then allow access again.p  pHow to do it with Nginx or without Nginxp  pP.S. I see such solution without Nginx 1. I receive request from a client. 2. I choose can I response a file to the client according security rules. 3. If access is allowed Ill read a file from file system with RandomAccessFile or another IO class and return bytes directly to the client without Nginx.p  pOr I can store all the files in a single flat file several gigabytes or terabytes and offsets and metadata id, file names, etc. in a second file. I can store the second file in RAM. Its OK with growing size of data. But will it has good performance for reading I think it has such advantage like very good writing performance on any file system.p

Negative 60724 pSetting the session backend to datastore will not work properly because every call to auth.getuserbysession causes a put to the datastore of the session entity even if you didnt modify the session values.p  pThats caused because a call to auth.getuserbysession makes a call to auth.getsessiondatapopTrue. PopTrue will indeed pop the user from the session dict object SessionDict from the webapp2extras.sessions which causes the session to get the attribute strongmodifiedstrong to True.p  pTherefore when the handler completes its tasks a call to savesession in the handler dispatch method will check if the session was modified and if True which always is TRUE will do the put to the datastore.p  pSo, for every request the session is put to the datastore because obviously youre calling auth.getuserbysession on each request.p  pI dont know how to handle this but I have already open a issue in the google code project page which seems abandoned a hrefhttpscode.google.compwebappimprovedissuesdetailid100ampsortid relnofollowhttpscode.google.compwebappimprovedissuesdetailid100ampsortidap  pCan anyone help me understand whats happening here and how can I solve thisp

Negative 60724 pSo i have this a hrefhttpimgur.comGPWFySm relnofollowimagea Im using a script on it to detect drag event so that the user can pull the scroll from the side of the screen.

Negative 60724 pIm working on a simple Chrome extension that puts a contenteditable div in the GMail composer, into the email body that listens to keyboard events and does some helpful type assistance. The basic idea is that after you send the email there is only the div remaining in the email without the type assistance. However Im not able to make the inserted div catch the keyboard events when one types into it. It works if inserted to other sites than GMail.p  pThe div element is inserted to the mail body like thisp  precode create div element var element  document.createElement div element.setAttribute contenteditable, true element.innerText  sample text element.addEventListener input, function event      console.log Input event caught  this never fires , true  insert it at the cursor var sel  window.getSelection var range  sel.getRangeAt 0 range.deleteContents  range.insertNode element codepre  pThis code part is in a file called gmailinline.js . I also put allframes true in the manifestp  precode   name extension,   manifestversion 2,   description description,   version 0.1,   background  page background.html ,   browseraction      defaulticon          19 imagesicon19.png,         38 imagesicon38.png     ,     defaulttitle test   ,   contentscripts [              matches [],         allframes true,         js [             gmailinline.js         ],        ],   permissions [     tabs   ]  codepre  pThe div nicely appears in the email body when the script is run. According to the Event Listeners in Chromes developer tools, the event is attached to the element, it simply doesnt fire somehow. I thought it could be some other event handlers preventing the event to get to this script, so I set event listening to be done in the capturing phase, but still nothing.p  pI did some research and found similar questions and answers that dont answer this case. And it seems to be unusual to attach an event handler to the element directly and not to the document. It seemed to be a good idea, as otherwise one has to deal with GMails deep iframe structure, and assign the listeners dynamically to the spawning iframes. So what do I do wrongp

Negative 60724 pI have a bunch of videos and depthmaps showing human poses from the Microsoft Kinect. p  pI can get a skeleton of the human in the video but what I want to do is recognize a certain pose from this skeleton data.p  pTo do that I need to annotate each frame in the videos with a 0 or 1, corresponding to bad pose and good pose, i.e. the frame has a binary state variable.p  pI want to be able to playback the avi file in matlab and then press space to switch between these two states and simultaneously add the state variable to an array giving the state for each frame in the video.p  pIs there a tool in matlab that can do this Otherwise matlab is not a restriction, python, C or any other language is fine.p  pI have been googling around, and most of the stuff I have found is to annotate individual frames with a polygon. I want to do this at maybe half the regular framerate of the video.p  pEDIT I used the solution provided by miindlek and decided to share a few things if someone runs into this. I needed to see in the video what annotation I was assigning to each frame, so I made a small circle in the upper left corner of the video as I displayed it. Hopefully this will be useful for someone else later. I also capture the key pressed with waitKey and then do something based on the output. This allows for multiple keys to be pressed during the annotations.p  precodeimport numpy as np import cv2 import os os.chdirPathToVideo   Blue cicle means that the annotation havent started  Green circle is a good pose  Red is a bad pose  White circle means we are done, press d for that   Instructions on how to use  Press space to swap between states, you have to press space when the person  starts doing poses.

It is essentially two nested codeforcode loops, the inner one is loops over the grid, the outer one advances the equation in time, somewhat like thisp  precodefor i1Nt1     for j2Nx1           simple diffusion equation         c2,i1  c1,i  DdtdxdxcL1,j12cL1,jcL1,j1      end      reimpose BCs     c2,11      c2,Nx1       save into solution matrix     if modi,floorNtsolno0         solcsoli1,  c2,         taxissoli1,1  idt         solisoli1     end      flip rows 1 and 2     c  flipudc  end codepre  pTo save memory, c is only a 2byNx matrix which I keep flipping on every time increment, saving, say, every 100th instance into a solution matrix.p  pNote that I used the simple diffusion equation here for the sake of clarity. The problem is that in reality I have to use a very fine grid about 200,000 points ideally in order to account for some rapidly changing coefficients which are a function of space. This, coupled with the stability criterion imposes a severe restriction on the size of the time step and the total time.p  pNow, Id like to optimise my code and I figured one way to go about it is to use the codeparforcode instead of codeforcode in the inner loop. Every element in the c2, row is only dependent on the elements from row c1, so this should work, right But when I try to run it it runs forever and doesnt produce anything. I didnt show it in the snippet but all the variables are already initialised when the loop starts so Im not sure whats causing the problem. I read through the codeparforcode documentation but I didnt find anything useful. I suspect it must have something to do with slicing but Im not sure how to tackle it. Also, maybe Im missing some other more efficient approach to the problem so any advice is appreciated.p  pEDIT Im adding the gist of my code stripped down to bare bones. codeparforcode performs much slower than codeforcode.p  precodetic gridpoints  400000 timeiter  200  c1  ones1,gridpoints c2  ones1,gridpoints x  linspace0,1,gridpoints k  1.0000001   for j1timeiter      parfor i2gridpoints1        c2i  c1i1  kc1i  c1i1     end  c1c2 end  toc codepre

Negative 60724 pI have a multimodular Maven project.p  pIn module A I have a class to which I generate a new method with javassist bytecode level in compile time. When I decompile the class I can see that the method is really there.p  pIn module B I want to call that generated method. It compiles and runs but IntelliJ is still reporting missing method.p  pIt seems that IDE uses directly .java file from sibling module rather than compiled and enhanced version.p  pIs there any way how to tell IntelliJ to look at .class files and not .java if the file is not in this particular modulep  pThanksp

Negative 60724 pI have heard there was a glitch early on with iOS7.1 where some apps would launch but immediately get killed the launch image would display but that would be it before getting killed. My issue I have an app on the app store which supports iOS7.1 to the latest iOS iOS8.3 at the time of the post. However some users who are running iOS7.1 are experiencing that they can no longer open the app it just closes immediately. These users were able to open it original, but all of a sudden they no longer can. Some users have rebooted, deleted the app etc but no use. There has not been a new update to the app since they first opened it which is weird. I also have Crashlythics in place that sends crash reports, however I am getting none. Because Crashlytics is set up in the codeAppDelegate.mcode, codeBOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptionscode, im starting to think that codedidFinishLaunchingcode is not getting a chance to be called before being killed. This strange behaviour only happens if the app is downloaded from the codeAppStorecode, if I manually add the app via codeXcodecode it works perfectly.p  pI know if a user updated to the latest iOS it will work, because it is working on the latest when downloaded from the store. I understand if a user, using an older device like the iPhone 4 or 5, doesnt update to iOS8 because of the sheer size of the download 3 gb if my memory serves me right. Has anyone else noticed this strange behaviour Im fining it difficult trying to explain to the boss et al. why it wont work when its supported and originally worked, and when Im not getting any crash reports via codeCrashlyticscode. I experienced this exact behaviour myself early on in iOS7 when launching codeFacebookcode.p  pIs there a solution to this problem I could pass on to supportp

Negative 60724 pIm modifying a library that contains a clientserver pair. From the server side, I get Protobuf messages asynchronously in a callback I have no control over this code, cant modify it. Now the problem is that some of these messages lets call them messages of type A have to trigger a sequential exchange of messages on the same TCP connection, through the same callback. My initial plan was to do something of the followingp  ul lipget a message of type A from the serverpli lipreceive other messages including the sequential ones that I need, filter them out the ones that are not part of the sequence, add to a queuepli lipwhen done with this batch of messages, simply take all the messages accumulated in the queue and repeatpli ul  pWhat should I use in Java to implement such a use case Another problem that I have with my approach is that I dont see a way of integrating a blocking queue I want to limit the number of messages that I process in a batch as well. Would the idea above be applicable or is there a better way of doing this Thank youp

Negative 60724 pUsing MVVM or MVP patterns, it doesnt really matter, which entity should have the responsibility to create dynamically view as response to an event p  pFor example, lets say that a button is pushed and now a new gui must be opened for the first time, where should I place the factory call to create the new viewp  pCreating a view from a presenter that has nothing to do with the view itself looks ugly to me. Mediate the button view and use a factory inside the mediator Use a factory inside a commandp  pNote I meant to remove the MVVM part, but then I received the first answer, which I assigned as correct because I like the general idea can be applied to MVP as well.

I can achieve a 3D perception when the scene is not changing with a single model. However, as soon as I change the distance then, the 3D view disappears and the xachis translation seems to strongbehave with a different impact while increasing  decreasing the zdistancestrong to my models. Therefore, I am not able to achieve a 3D perception with more then 1 model in a row on the zachis, somehow the view doesnt fit then whatever I do.

Negative 60724 pWas hoping somebody can help me with this.  I am using an imagePicker to select an image from my photo library in an iOS chat app.  p  pI want the behaviour of selecting the image to mimic that of iMessage.  The specific problem I am having is seeing a preview of the selected image.  I want to see this preview and have the option to choose or cancel, but NOT to edit.  p  pIf I set imagePicker.allowsEditing  True, the preview of the selected image is shown, however I can scroll and zoom it.  I want the image to just display statically.  p  pIf I set the imagePicker.allowsEditing  False, once the image is chosen from the library the didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo is called without the image being previewed.  If I then add a segue in this method and set up my own view, there is no way to go back to the library as it is dismissed already.p  pBasically I just want to mimic the iMessage way of picking an image from my library and was hoping to do it without using a custom imagePickerp  pThank youp

Negative 60724 pI am trying to install an application using the SYSTEM account that installs some certificates in the ProgramData folder by creating a new folder inside it. The installation fails at the stage where it tries to install these certificates. p  pDuring the certificate installation process, all it does is create a folder inside ProgramData and write files into it.p  pI have given FULL CONTROL permission to the SYSTEM user on the ProgramData folder and passed it to subfolders as well.p  pI have tried executing the .exe file using PSexec tool this enables using the SYSTEM account.

So, I tried installing it in a 32bit Windows.

Negative 60724 pRight now I have a PySide application that reads input from devices that act like keyboards. My problem is that when the input is too fast PySide skips repetitive characters. For example if I send the text 12223 in keystrokes the application receives only 123. This behavior is limited to repetitive characters as far as I can see. My application currently is running on Linux and to simulate the fast input I used the command  xte str 12223  What could I do to avoid this behavior, is there some parameter that could stop this filtration of events that PySide is doingp  pThanks.p
