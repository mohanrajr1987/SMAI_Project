Positive 236 pWhen writing code I often have checks to see if errors occurred. An example would be p  precodechar x  malloc somebytes   if x  NULL      fprintf stderr, Malloc failed.n       exitEXITFAILURE   codepre  pIve also used codestrerror errno code in the past. p  pIve only ever written small desktop appications where it doesnt matter if the program codeexitcodeed in case of an error. p  pNow, however, Im writing C code for an embedded system Arduino and I dont want the system to just exit in case of an error. I want it to go to a particular statefunction where it can power down systems, send error reports and idle safely. p  pI could simply call an codeerrorhandlercode function, but I could be deep in the stack and very low on memory, leaving codeerrorhandlercode inoperable.  p  pInstead, Id like execution to effectively collapse the stack, free up a bunch of memory and start sorting out powering down and error reporting. There is a serious fire risk if the system doesnt power down safely. p  pIs there a standard way that safe error handling is implemented in low memory embedded systemsp  pEDIT 1 Ill limit my use of codemalloccode in embedded systems. In this particular case, the errors would occur when reading a file, if the file was not of the correct format. p

Positive 236 pSo Im working on an embedded project that needs to compute floating point numbers.  Obviously theres various ways to estimate the output and reduce compute cycles.  My question is, how expensive is a floating point compare vs an integer compare relatively speaking, not exact cycles  One of the operation can probably be optimized this way, but I am wondering if it is worth the effort.  The chip is a cortex M0 no floating point hardware.  All floating point is done through software.p
Positive 236 pI have a simple loadable kernel module which controls an LED by providing blinkingPeriod, onoff features etc...p  pThe device is present at sysled , and functions fine.p  pI have provided an input paramater for the command line which takes in which GPIO the LED is connnected to. Now I want to reuse the same kernel module, for an additional number of LEDs, however I cannot load the module with insmod for additional LEDs with a different command line parameter, since an error is thrownp  pError could not insert module  File exists.p  pI know this is telling me that I cannot load the same module twice, but what is the best approach when trying to provide LKMs for multiple devices  p  pThe only solution I can think of is to rewrite a LKM for each individual LEDdevice which hardly seems efficient, or pack all of the LEDs in one LKM which isnt very scalableportable.p  pDoes anyone have any comments on the best approach.

Positive 236 pI am developing a new wireless IoTproduct for a company. The current prototype is using ZigBee for communications and I am currently trying to figure out how to avoid having to run a dedicated ZigBeeCoordinator device. I do not want to develop a second hardware just to let it act as the main ZigBee Coordinator. For this hardware Meshing is very important.p  pSo I read about the Digi S2C modules and stumbled over the fact that this module has a larger flash and therefor incorporates all three ZigBeeFirmwares EndDevice, Router, Coordinator into one single file. With using serialcommands you can then change the devicemode from coordinator to router or end device. p  pBy thinking about it I came up to the following idea how to avoid having a second hardware just acting as a coordinator.p  ol lipemBy powering up the first hardware unit the ZigBee Module runs as a Router  EndDevice and is looking for a coordinatorempli lipemIf there is no coordinator the module resets itself and changes its     devicemode to become the coordinatorempli liemEvery following unit does the same and will connect to the first     unit which acts as the coordinatoremli ol  pUsing this concept I could stick with my single hardware and let it automatically choose between running as an EndDevice, Router or Coordinator. p  pQuestions arep  pI know that you can put custom code onto the ZigBeeModules controller. Is this controller able to reset itself and restart in a different operationmode Like leaving a flag before restarting or sop  pOr do I need a second controller that is taking care of such a processp  pAm I missing some detail in the ZigBeeStack that has already implemented such a conceptp

Positive 236 pI need to implement a small fragment of code in assembly for an 32 bit AVR memory test testing RAM under the running C program, no other way to solve it, however I cant find any documentation on the AVR32 specifics of inline assembler, and trial and error neither led me to success.p  pFirst thing Does anyone know about any docs describing the AVR32 specifics of inline ASM Particularly the input  output register specificationsp  pI managed to get to the point where I was able to write the inline fragment with automatic input  output register allocation, however a strange behavior prevents me to complete it. Take the following fragment of codep  precodeint ret int ad0 int ad1  ...  asm volatile  mov     r2,  0  nt  mov     r3,  1  nt  mov     2,  0   nt  rret  rad0, rad1  r2, r3  codepre  pCompiled with optimizations off using avr32gcc it produces the following assembly output codeScodep  precodeAPP   95 svramt.c 1  mov     r2,  r8    mov     r3,  r8    mov     r9,  0       0  2 NOAPP codepre  pNotice how 0 and 1 mapped to the same register r8. This seems to happen if an output register is present. To check whether I used inline assembly improperly here, I also tried X86 with the native gcc on the hostp  precodeint ret int ad0 int ad1  ...  asm volatile  mov     0,    eax nt  mov     1,    ebx nt  mov     0,     2,   nt  rret  rad0, rad1  eax, ebx  codepre  pThis fragment compiles top  precodeAPP  7 asmtest.c 1  mov     esi,    eax   mov     edx,    ebx   mov     0,     ecx,      0  2 NOAPP codepre  pThis is what I expected to happen with the AVR32 counterpart, all inputs and outputs mapping to different registers.p  pI would have liked to work around the problem if it is a bug in avr32gcc by specifying the registers directly trying r8 and such as input  output specs, but it doesnt compile that way.p  pIf there is no documentation, does anyone know where the register specs for inline asm could be found in a normal x86 or ARM GCCs source It would worth a try, but GCC is a huge beast to wade through without any prior knowledge.p  pI dont believe I have enough karma to get this done with an ASM module with near zero knowledge of AVR32 assembly, and that would at least need the documentation of the calling convention anyway which I neither found so far...p  pstrongEDITstrong Further experimenting shown that using codeamprcode for output specifier seems to solve the register mapping problem. Why so, I am clueless two inputs mapped to the same register. At least the thing may be tested since it now produces the intended assembly fragment.p  pFurther research revealed a hrefhttpwww.nongnu.orgavrlibcusermanualinlineasm.html relnofollowthis AVR 8 bit documenta which offers part of a solution by describing square brackets for providing names for the operands which names can be used in the assembly fragment. This eliminates probable ambiguity between which operand would map to which codencode specification in the fragment. I couldnt see this syntax described in other documents, but works in avr32gcc as well, so was usefulp

Positive 236 pSuppose you have some data transmitting peripheral, like a UART, that signals an interrupt whenever its ready to transmit more data. Were sending data from a circular buffer, where codetailcode is where the data is removed from, codeheadcode is where you add data, and codetail  headcode means that theres no more data to transmit.p  pLets also assume that the peripheral has no buffering whatsoever, and you cant pass it the next value to send while its busy sending the current one. If you need a concrete, if madeup, example, think of a shift register attached directly to a CPUs parallel IO port.p  pTo keep transmitter as busy as possible, you might wish to transmit as soon as the transmit interrupt handler is entered. When theres no data to transmit, the interrupt is masked out and the handler will not be invoked even though the interrupt has been armed. The system starts in with the interrupt masked out. p  pIll use C to illustrate things, although the issue is not Cspecific. The interrupt handler, and the buffer, are set up as followsp  precodechar buf[...] char  head  buf                     lt write pointer char  tail  buf                     lt read pointer char  const first  buf              lt first byte of the buffer char  const last  bufsizeofbuf1 lt last byte of the buffer   Sends one byte out. The interrupt handler will be invoked as soon  as another byte can be sent. void transmitchar       void handler    transmittail   if tail  last     tail  first   else     tail   if tail  head     maskinterrupt  codepre  pSo far, so good. Now lets see how one might implement codeputchcode.  We can invoke codeputchcode in bursts much faster than the device is able to send the data out. Lets assume that the caller knows not to overflow the buffer.p  precodevoid putchchar c    head  c   if head  last     head  first   else     head      unmaskinterrupt  codepre  pSuppose now that these things happenp  ol liThe transmitter was busy, and when codeputchcode was called, there a byte was being sent.li liThe transmission happens to finish when codeputchcode is in the spot marked codecode above. The codehandlercode happens to execute right there. li liThe codehandlercode happens to send the last byte of the data in the buffer  the byte that we have just loaded in preceding lines in codeputchcode.li ol  pThe handler masks the interrupt, as theres no more data to send, but codeputchcode incorrectly unmasks it right after codehandlercode returns. Thus the codehandlercode will have another go through the buffer, and will send a buffers worth of stale data until codetailcode equals codeheadcode again.p  pMy questions is strongIs the only fix to increase the latency and check for empty buffer before sending in the codehandlercodestrong The fixed code looks as followsp  precodevoid fixedhandler    if head  tail      maskinterrupt     arminterrupt  so that next time we unmask it, we get invoked     return      transmittail   if tail  last     tail  first   else     tail  codepre  pThis fix adds some latency, and also adds an extra operation codearminterruptcode thats executed once when theres no more data to send.p  pFor possible other approaches, feel free to assume the existence of at least the following operationsp  precode Is the interrupt armed and will the handler fire once unmasked bool isarmed  Is the interrupt unmasked bool isunmasked codepre

Positive 236 pHello USB  Linux gurusp  pI have an embedded system based on an Atmel ARM CortexA5 CPU.

Everything is working well.p  pHowever When plugging in this embedded system into a host OS like Windows, a situation arises when I must notify Window of the new MTP device.

Negative 236 pMy question is whether or not Flexs fcsh can be called from within a PHP script.  Here is the backgroundp  pI have been created a simple process that creates a simple quiztutorial by converting a text file into a .mxml file and compiling to a .swf file using the mxmlc compiler.  This works well from the command line, but I wanted to make the process easier by creating a webinterface to do this.  My initial attempts with PHPs exec function have not worked.  The Python scripts I use to create the .mxml file work fine using exec, but I have not been able to get the mxmlc compiler to work.p  pAfter searching on the Web and on this site, I believe that using fcsh instead of mxmlc may be the way to go.  Using fcsh would certainly compile the .mxml file faster after the first run, and I think that fcsh can be launched as a service that might be able to be called from PHP.p  pOn the other hand, maybe I am approaching this the wrong way.  Would it be better to write a Flex application that calls fcsh and avoid using PHPp  pstrongEditstrong Using fcshctl as hasseg suggested in his answer below worked very well.  Thanks Ali.p

Negative 236 pIve been playing around with a set of templates for determining the correct promotion type given two primitive types in C.  The idea is that if you define a custom numeric template, you could use these to determine the return type of, say, the operator function based on the class passed to the templates.  For examplep  precode Custom numeric class template ltclass Tgt struct Complex      ComplexT real, T imag  rreal, iimag      T r, i  Other implementation stuff    Generic arithmetic promotion template template ltclass T, class Ugt struct ArithmeticPromotion      typedef typename X type   I realize this is incorrect, but the point is it would                                figure out what X would be via trait testing, etc    Specialization of arithmetic promotion template template ltgt class ArithmeticPromotionltlong long, unsigned longgt      typedef typename unsigned long long type    Arithmetic promotion template actually being used template ltclass T, class Ugt Complexlttypename ArithmeticPromotionltT, Ugttypegt operator ComplexltTgtamp lhs, ComplexltUgtamp rhs      return Complexlttypename ArithmeticPromotionltT, Ugttypegtlhs.r  rhs.r, lhs.i  rhs.i  codepre  pIf you use these promotion templates, you can more or less treat your user defined types as if theyre primitives with the same promotion rules being applied to them.  So, I guess the question I have is would this be something that could be useful  And if so, what sorts of common tasks would you want templated out for ease of use  Im working on the assumption that just having the promotion templates alone would be insufficient for practical adoption.p  pIncidentally, Boost has something similar in its mathtoolspromotion header, but its really more for getting values ready to be passed to the standard C math functions that expect either 2 ints or 2 doubles and bypasses all of the integral types.  Is something that simple preferable to having complete control over how your objects are being convertedp  pTLDR What sorts of helper templates would you expect to find in an arithmetic promotion header beyond the machinery that does the promotion itselfp

Negative 236 pI am pretty new to this stuff but I am running into a conceptwall and I keep going back and forth with the best way to handle the problem. p  pI have a multiview process to filling out a New User Form. Each view has a small part of the entire form. In each view I have a model and the model has properties set to an instance of a LINQ to SQL class for prepopulating along with dropdown data state, country. I also thought I should have a model value object that represents the entire form. This value object has properties for each LINQ class as well. So I made the view take the value object as a dependency injection. Then what Just set a property to ViewData to send in multiple models Seems like a bad idea since I would have to do that to every view. Should all view models come from a base class with the value objectp  pI might be way off already. Hopefully someone can help me get back on track. The ultimate goal is to have an object that represents the statedata of a form that spans multiple views and the form fields should populate if data is present.p  pThanks for your patiencep

Negative 236 pI have a server that has several clients C1...Cn to each of which there is a TCP connection established.

Negative 236 pIve written a little library that uses implicits to add functionality that one only needs when using the REPL in Scala. Ruby has libraries like this  for things like pretty printing, firing up text editors like the interactiveeditor gem which invokes Vim from irb  see a hrefhttpzegoggl.es200904integratingvimandirb.htmlthis posta, debuggers and the like. The library I am trying to write adds some methods to java.lang.Class and java.lang.reflect classes using the pimp my library implicit conversion process to help you go and find documentation initially, with Google, then later possibly with a JavaDocScalaDoc viewer, and maybe the StackOverflow API eventually. Its an itchscratching library I spend so much time copying and pasting classnames into Google that I figured I may as well automate the process.p  pIt is the sort of functionality that developers will want to add to their system for use only in the REPL  they shouldnt really be adding it to projects partly because it may not be something that their fellow developers want, but also because if you are doing some exploratory development, it may be with just a Scala REPL thats not being invoked by an IDE or build tool.p  pIn my case, I want to include a few classes and set up some implicits  include a .jar on the CLASSPATH and import it, basically.p  pIn Ruby, this is the sort of thing that youd add to your .irbrc file. Other REPLs have similar ways of setting options and importing libraries.p  pIs there a similar file or way of doing this for the Scala REPLp

Negative 236 pQuick background, I am using Netbeans to develop this I dont have much experience with Swing and have lost points on experience at the chance to gain development speed. In Netbeans it is obviously restrictive as to what code you can modify to stop novice users breaking the code which I have already amusingly done once Anyway, I have a class of Objects, these Objects have a name property. Within the application I have directly initialised an array of these objects and called them thingsp  precodeObjects[] things  new Objects[2] things[0]  new ObjectsThe first thing things[1]  new ObjectsThe second thing codepre  pThe contents and names are deliberately inane as this is a test to get this working rather than pulling apart a part written program. After some research and reading I have discovered that I should be able to load objects into the setModel parameter using the following codep  precode    new javax.swing.DefaultComboBoxModelthings[].name The above is the code to use within setModel, the below is the completed example     jComboBox1.setModelnew javax.swing.DefaultComboBoxModelthings[].name codepre  pThis hasnt worked, and despite my best efforts to google this seems to be too specific to nail down a decent answer. The end result is that I would like to have The first thing and The second thing displayed within the drop down list, and then obviously I can expand on this within the real program by referencing any other data held in that object on the screen.p  pAny suggestions or even pointers to help me think this out would be appreciated.p

But then codestomp.onclosecode again does nothing and codewindow.onbeforeunloadcode gives me a broken pipe.p  pSo these were attempts to implement client leaves message before qutting idea. But that failed.p  pIm not even sure whether Im doing this right. Is there a way to notify orbitedstomp users about leaving of a user All ideas would be appreciated.p  pEDIT Maybe theres antother way. Ive read that it is possible to configure orbited server to make an http callback to the application with the users key when someones connection closes. Unfortunetly there was no explanation how to do that. Anyone knows the answerp

Negative 236 pIm working on a site where users can describe a physical object using amongst many other things any color in the rgb 0255 range.

Basically, the algorithm needs to determine if a 2 humans picking 2 different colors could be describing the same object. Thus Light RedRed should be 100, Most of the shades of grey will be 100 to each other, etc but red green is definitely not a match.p  pTo get a decent look at how the algorithms were working, I plotted grayscale and 3 intensities of each hue against every other color in the set and indicated no match 0 with black, visually identical 100 with white and grayscale to indicate the intermediate values.p  pMy first very simplistic approach was to simply treat the RGB values as coordinates in the colour cube and work out the distance magnitude of the vector between them.p  pThis threw out a number of problems with regards to Black50 Grey being a larger distance than say Black50 Blue. having run hundreds of comparisons and asked for feedback, this doesnt seem to match human perception shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comT1VG8.png altMethod 1p  pMethod 2 converted the RGB values into a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHSLandHSV relnofollowHSVa.

Negative 236 pIm animating sprites w javacript  these sprites consist of a container DIV and the firstChild is an absolute positioned IMG. The image is comprised of 16 vertical viewsangles of the object. When the object moves from A to B, the ATAN2 function calculates the styletop value appropriate to the direction the object is traveling in. This all works except for another aspect of the sprite  they can change their size. The default size of the sprite is 24px wide and this does work with ATAN2, but as soon as the sprite is made bigger the calculation misaligns the sprites framestrip. Below is the code, x1  y1 are the from and to positions, while s is the size width. the value 128 is the maximum size  and the bracked values are of a sprite allowed and the last calculation assumes this, then computes for the actual size with s128 ...p  precodefunction Panglex1,x2,y1,y2,s  var vparseIntMath.atan2x2x1,y2y1Math.PI180180 return vgt348.750vgt326.25128vgt303.75256vgt281.25384vgt258.75512vgt236.25640vgt213.75768vgt191.25896vgt168.751024vgt146.251152vgt123.751280vgt101.251408vgt78.751536vgt56.251664vgt33.751792vgt11.2519200s128  codepre
Negative 236 pI have a custom Sequence type. It is essentially a wrapper for a list plus a boolean flag and I wanted it to emulate usual immutable sequence behavior.p  pMy issue is with slicing. I understand that in Python 3 the way to implement it is to have a codegetitemkeycode method that returns an item if codekeycode is a single index and a sliced sequence if codekeycode is a slice object. But how should I discriminate these casesp  pI basically have two hypotheses.p  precodeslicedlist  self.wrappedlist[key] if isinstancekey, slice     return MyCustomSequenceTypeslicedlist, booleanflag return slicedlist codepre  pBut this is evil, isnt it Orp  precodeslicedlist  self.wrappedlist[key] try     return MyCustomSequenceTypeslicedlist, booleanflag except TypeError     return slicedlist codepre  pThe latter looks more pythonic. It relies on the fact that codeMyCustomSequenceType.initself, datas, flagcode calls lendatas, it so raise codeTypeErrorcode if codedatascode is an codeintegercode. But then, if codeinitcode raises codeTypeErrorcode for another random issue  it will be untraceable. Also a hrefhttpwiki.cython.orgenhancementsnumpygetitem relnofollowhttpwiki.cython.orgenhancementsnumpygetitema hints that codeisinstancecode is faster in fact more easily optimizable.p  pWhat should I do, thenp

Negative 236 pI am very familiar with JavaScript and OOP but am very unfamiliar with designing JS classes that are used for programming the UI HTML. I have searched around a bit but have not come across any prevalent patterns.p  pLets say I wanted to dynamically create panellike objects similar to Microsoft Windows panels. Each object needs a container, a header area that could include a text label, and a close button that has a click event handler. In addition to a DOM representation HTML, the object would also have a JavaScript object representation variables and methods. Here is one way I have triedp  precode  Window class  var Window  functionparams      this.testMethod  function          console.logtest   just an example           this.windowDiv  document.createElementdiv     this.windowDiv.style.width  params.width  px     this.windowDiv.style.height  params.height  px     this.windowDiv.style.position  absolute     this.windowDiv.style.top  30px     this.windowDiv.style.left  30px     this.windowDiv.style.border  1px solid 000      this.headerDiv  document.createElementdiv     this.headerDiv.style.width  100     this.headerDiv.style.height  30px     this.headerDiv.style.background  bbb     this.headerDiv.style.borderBottom  1px solid 000     this.headerDiv.innerHTML  params.title      this.buttonDiv  document.createElementdiv     this.buttonDiv.style.width  30px     this.buttonDiv.style.height  18px     this.buttonDiv.style.position  absolute     this.buttonDiv.style.top  0px     this.buttonDiv.style.right  5px     this.buttonDiv.style.textAlign  center     this.buttonDiv.style.background  red     this.buttonDiv.style.border  0px 1px 1px 1px solid 000     this.buttonDiv.innerHTML  x     this.buttonDiv.addEventListenerclick, functione          document.body.removeChilde.target.parentNode.parentNode     , false      this.headerDiv.appendChildthis.buttonDiv     this.windowDiv.appendChildthis.headerDiv     document.body.appendChildthis.windowDiv    Initialize var myWindow  new Window     width 400,     height 200,     title My Window  myWindow.testMethod codepre  pThis doesnt feel right. Another approach might be to have a render method and use it to separate out the HTML generation code. It seems awkward that the JS object contains multiple nested HTML objects inside of it. Should I just pass in the nested tags via innerHTMLp  pSo I am curious... what is the best approach here What is the best way to design classes that have DOM code HTML objects and styling and traditional variables and methods Is there a way to use Prototypes for these HTML objects You can even imagine in this example that there is also a WindowManager class that contains instantiated Window objects, helps manage them, and creates new ones. And it, too, could have an HTML representation.p  pSome of the above could be handled with static CSS and applying IDsclasses to clean up some of the code, but lets just say that positioning and size must be accomplished programmatically to handle resizing, dragdrop, etc..p  pI am not interested in frameworklevel solutions that could be provided by ExtJS, jQuery, etc. I want to know what the best practices are for homegrown code. In fact, Id be interested in knowing how the engineers of said frameworks design their UI classes.p

I didnt really understand the reason. Jon Skeet explained this with saying only that first one compiles because in .NET, arrays are covariant, and second one doesnt compile because generics are not covariant theyre invariant, instead. And furthermore, arrays are covariant in .NET, because arrays are covariant in Java and .NET made it similar to Java.p  pIm not completely statisfied with this shortanswer.

Negative 236 pIm consuming some web services done in java using a Rest architecture, my client its a mobile application that uses HttpConnection to retrieve the data. In order to control authentication and authorization Im using cookies, managed by a SessionScoped class, however I dont know how to make the session persist through requests. The problem basically is that I inject the Session manager in other services that are RequestScoped, however since the session is not persisted I always retrieve differente instances for the SessionScoped class, thus deleting all the cookies or records I had before. Looking at the request headers I noticed the cookie JSESSIONID, I think this is sent by tomcat in order to persist session, so tried already to send the same cookie in the next request, however I got no results.

Once a files data was flushed, it moves the file to a sent directory, and then continues to the next file if any.p  pHeres my Java codep  precodeimport java.net. import java.io.  public class Client   public class MyFileFilter implements FilenameFilter      public boolean acceptFile dir, String name          return name.toLowerCase.endsWith.txt        public Client      try           String dirName  varlibadt         String sentDir  varlibadtsent          File directory  new FiledirName         if directory.exists              System.out.printlndirectory does not exist  Location   dirName             return                    get files in directory         File[] listOfFiles  directory.listFilesnew MyFileFilter          if listOfFiles  null  listOfFiles.length  0              System.out.printlnNo files to send.             return                   FileInputStream fin         DataInputStream dis          String sendAddr  192.168.1.9         int sendPort  9486          Socket client  new SocketsendAddr, sendPort         getting the op stream of that connection         PrintStream out  new PrintStreamclient.getOutputStream         reading the response using input stream         BufferedReader in new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderclient.getInputStream          System.out.printlnSending files to   sendAddr    sendPort            for int i  0 i lt listOfFiles.length i               if listOfFiles[i].isFile                   String fName  listOfFiles[i].getName                 if fName.endsWith.txt  fName.endsWith.TXT                      fin  new FileInputStream dirName  fName                     dis  new DataInputStreamfin                      String message                       String messagePart                       while messagePart  dis.readLine  null                         message  messagePart  n                      if message.equals                         continue                      System.out.printlnSending file   fName   with message   message                      out.printmessage                     System.out.printlnWritten                     out.flush                     System.out.printlnFlushed                       move file to sent directory                     File dir  new FilesentDir                      boolean success  listOfFiles[i].renameTonew Filedir, fName                     if success                           File was not successfully moved                         System.out.printlnFile not successfully moved to sent directory.                                           dis.close                     fin.close                                                 in.close         out.close          client.shutdownOutput         if client.isClosed             client.close          System.out.printlnSuccessfully sent all files      catch Exception e          System.out.printlnERROR while sending file   e.toString         e.printStackTrace         public static void mainString a[]      new Client    codepre  pFor my console output I get thisp  precodejarrettjarrettLatitudeD520Downloads java Client  Sending files to 192.168.1.99486 Sending file blah.txt with message asdpoifjawpeoifjawpeoifjwapoeifjapwoie  Written Flushed Successfully sent all files codepre  pSo as far as I can tell, everything is fine on my end.

In order to run the QuickCheck routines one should run the executable emtesterem. It seems that small length vectors dont crash the program, but when it gets longer the program slows down and finally blows the memory up. Another thing that intrigues me is the fact that Im having a similar problem in an other of my libraries while rendering XML files. For small files lt400k it runs slow but with no crash and for larger files the memory blows up. The Data.Vector is also involved in that library. I have the intuition these problems are related.p  pstrongEditstrong Ive finally isolated the part of my code that reproduce the memory leak and put it into a single file which can be found a hrefhttphpaste.org65687 relnofollowherea.

Negative 236 pThis question is about the specification of several functions in the C11 Standard Library, that take their arguments as rvalue references, but do not consume them in all cases. One example is codestdunorderedsetltTgtinsertTampampcode.p  pIt is pretty clear, that this method will use the move constructor of codeTcode to construct the element within the container, if it does not already exist. However, what happens if the element already exists in the container I am pretty sure there is no reason the change the object in the case. However, I didnt find anything in the C11 Standard supporting my claim.p  pHere is an example to show why this might be interesting. The following code reads lines from stdcin and remove the first occurrence of duplicate lines.p  precodestdunorderedsetltstdstringgt seen stdstring line while getlinestdcin, line      bool inserted  seen.insertstdmoveline.second     if inserted           Is it safe to use line here, i.e. can I assume that the           insert operation hasnt changed the string object, because            the string already exists, so there is no need to consume it.          stdcout ltlt line ltlt n       codepre  pApparently, this example works with GCC 4.7.

Im wondering if any of you guys have experience with theseor similar barcode scanners, and if so what would be the best way to implement a frontend application I was originally going to use Access 2010 to make a few basic forms that would automatically submit each time a barcode is scanned. Now Im really not sure. This scanner will be used in conjunction with a scale that will upload to the same row. Im fairly new to SQL Server, however I have lots of database experience with things like MySQL.p  pThanks a lot guys, if any of you know of a more appropriate forum please just tell me.p

Negative 236 pSo I recently followed a hrefhttpwww.cnjava.comdownloaddatabooksocketchat.pdf relnofollowthisa tutorial on making a basic chatroom in Java. It uses multithreading and is a connectionoriented server. I was wondering how I could use the same Sockets and ServerSockets to send, say, the 3d position of an object instead of just a stringp  pCurrently, the basic chatroom system just sends a string to the server and then the server sends it to all connected clients. What I want is to be able to have a client change the position of an object most likely their character, and send the change of position to the server. Then I would imagine the server would send that change in position to each of the clients connected to it, and each client would in turn render this object at its new position.p  pI was wondering what the embestem way to do something like this was Would it be to send a string and have the server parse it into a coordinate Can I write more than one thing to a DataOutputStream at oncep  pI feel like I may have explained this poorly, so please ask some clarifying questions.p  pThanksp

Negative 236 pBrand new to the Log4Net library and there is something I have not been able to figure out.p  pI assume the buffer is in memory only, right  And when you start a new instance of your application the buffer is reinitialized  I have a requirement where Ive been told to only send an email to tech support after an application fails x number of times.  This application will be run on a schedule every two minutes or so.  If it fails, it will just try again in two minutes.  If it fails too many times unsuccessfully and is failing due to errors being thrown then it should send the email out.p  pThe easiest way I can think to do this right now is to persist the number of failed attempts to the user.config.  Then, when my program catches an exception check to see how many failed attempts have occurred, and if the threshold is hit then to send an email using the correct loggerappender.  After a successful run of the program, the last thing it would do before exiting would be to reset the user.config setting to 0 failed attempts.p  pIs there a better way  Perhaps some way to persist the buffer so that I can do something with the lossy settingp

Negative 236 pI am looking for some advice on designing a class hierarchy for game objects. For this discussion I will mainly talk about two specific classes. An codeObjectcode and codeSpritecode.p  pThe codeObjectcode is the base class for any type of object in the game. codeSpritecode inherits directly from codeObjectcode, but some of codeObjectcodes public methods no longer make sense. Here is some code to explainp  precodeclass Object  public     Object  rendererNULL, controllerNULL, colliderNULL       virtual Object      Renderer getRenderer const     Controller getController const     Collider getCollider const      void setRendererRenderer renderer     void setControllerController controller     void setColliderCollider collider private     Renderer renderer     Controller controller     Collider collider  codepre  pcodeObjectcode has three components a renderer, collider, and a controller.  codeSpritecode of course has these three components, but uses a codeSpriteRenderercode. I figured then I would not want the codesetRenderercode method exposed for the sprite class.p  pSo I thought that I should write the sprite class as followsp  precodeclass Sprite  protected Object  public     SpriteTexture texture  Object, texturetexture          setRenderernew SpriteRendererthis           Renderer getRenderer const     Controller getController const     Collider getCollider const      void setControllerController controller     void setColliderCollider collider private     Texture texture  codepre  pwhere the getters and setters just call the relevant codeObjectcode method. But in this case, I can not really use the codeSpritecode as an codeObjectcode, e.g. pass it to a function which takes codeObjectcodes.p  pMy other implementation isp  precodeclass Sprite  public Object  public     SpriteTexture texture  Object, texturetexture          setRenderernew SpriteRendererthis      private     Texture texture  codepre  pwhich exposes the codesetRenderercode method.p  pMy thought process is that the codesetRenderercode method should not be exposed because a codeSpritecode is an codeObjectcode with a codeSpriteRenderercode, so if it is changed, then it is not a codeSpritecode. However, I do not see an obvious way to prevent it from changing.p  pIn general is this something I should just not worry about, or is there another way to go about this designp

Negative 236 pSay I have two classes with different names but the exactly same structure. It there a way to cast an object of the one class to one of the otherp  pThis might sound stupid to do but there is a reason why I want to do that. The architecture of my application provides the abstract classes codecomponentcode and codestoragecode The ready application will contain several specialized components derived from codecomponentcode and each of them will define its own storage type, derived from codestoragecode. During initialization of the application, for each component there will be a storage object of its custom storage type created and passed as pointer to the component.p  pThis way all component stay completely independent which is great for reusability and testing. But, of course, there is a need to exchange informations between components. To do that with independence in mind, I want to let two components get a storage pointer pointing to the same storage. The pointer by constraint must be of the component specific storage type.p  pframework code abstract classesp  precodeclass Storage   class Component  public     void SetStorageStorage storage private     Storage storage  codepre  pexample componentp  precodeclass PhysicsStorage  public Storage class PhysicsComponent  public Component codepre  panother componentp  precodeclass CollisionStorage  public Storage  same structure as PhysicsStorage as both components need the same data like world coordinates and rotations of all forms in the 3d space class CollisionComponent  public Component codepre  pmain applicationp  precodeinclude system.h  PhysicsStorage Worlddata  PhysicsComponent Physics CollisionComponent Collision  Physics.SetStorageampWorlddata Collision.SetStorageampWorlddata  this points to a PhysicsStorage but that is actually the same like a CollisionStorage which is expected codepre  pSo I wonder if there is a way of casting the pointer of say codePhysicsStoragecode to codeCollisionStoragecode. In this case, both are defined in the file of their related component class. And both are derived from abstract codeStoragecode.p  pI only want to do that in the case that both custom storage types have exactly the same structure. Otherwise it would be senseless. I am not so familiar with advances pointer usage so I wonder if there is a way to do that. What I know is that you can cast to a base class, but this isnt what I want here. Using a shared storage type for two components would break independence. Thanks a lotp

But the problem here is this  By default, the scroll view seems to take the photo width as the default scroll offset  i.e. if I am at the 1st photo amp then scroll right, then it scrolls to 320.0px offset by default I get this value in scrollViewDidEndDecelerating, though I want it to scroll to 360px adding the 40px of black spacing. How do I change this default scroll offsetp

Negative 236 pMy question involves the performance gain or loss when declaring and using functions with JavaScript. Suppose I have a function, codefoocode, defined as suchp  precodefunction fooarg1      a simple CSS change, such as changing background color  codepre  pWhere codearg1code is a String used to identify an HTML element. codefoocode is triggered on a mouseover event.  The CSS change happens using jQuery, but I dont think thats important to my question. I would like to revert the CSS property back to default on a mouseout event. Would there be performance advantages of declaring another function, codefoo2code, such asp  precodefunction foo2arg1      undo the CSS change  codepre  pOr would it be better to redefine codefoocode as follows, using a second argument as a switchp  precodefunction fooarg1,arg2      ifarg2  change          make the CSS change for arg1     else ifarg2  revert          revert the change for arg1       codepre  pI am not concerned with the load time of the page. My goal is to minimize my amount of code, but without hampering the speed of the CSS change.p  pstrongEDITstrong codearg1code will not strictly refer to one element. It can be used to identify a set of elements, such as a class name shared by codelttdgtcodes in a column. This is why the codehovercode CSS selector will not do what I need to do.p  pstrongEDITstrong Again, for clarity, suppose I have a set of elements containing the class codearg1code.

Negative 236 pIn the process of evaluating the various approaches available to developers to use javascript modules, module loaders and build tools, id like some suggestions on what tools you use, and why.p  pIm currently after something that is able tobr encourage modular codebr allow features to be added based on necessity to a given module [think mixinsinheritance]br produce a BUILD that contains a development release, and at the very minimum a production release with different layers say, i want a layer [a script] which contains my bootstrap   code, module 1, 2 and 3 and then another layer which contains modules 4,5 and 6. This way I can defer loading of code based on whats actually going on in the application.br Work [when built for production] in an extremely low bandwidth scenario, with xfer speeds of 1kbps and high latency think worst case mobile connection over GPRS to get the picture.  p  pIve seen the following Using prototype inheritance, as inp  precodemyNS.thing  function myns.thing.prototype       something foo  codepre  pWhich can be built by simply taking the contents of this script, and appending it to the next one one wants to include in a production optimized package as a single script. Loaders in this case are simple script tag injectionsevals or similar, based on a known file.p  pIve also seen other approaches, such asp  precodefunction     return function         something foo       codepre  pBuilding this already gets more complex because one has to manipulate the script, removing the wrapping self executing function and combining the return values into one object. I am not aware of an easy way to use available build tools. The loader approach works the same as above.p  pBoth of these approaches lack dependencies.p  pThen we have AMDp  precodedefinemymodule, [dep1], functiondep1     return something dep1  codepre  pSome might be nauseated by its indenting, and its ceremony, but still its quite effective, the google closure compiler knows about it natively, it knows about dependencies, and seems to have widespread adoption across the board. There are a bunch of module loaders available for it httpsdocs.google.comspreadsheetccckey0Aqln2akPWiMIdERkY3J2OXdOUVJDTkNSQ2ZsV3hoWVEgid2 and quite a few build tools as well.p  pWhat other options do you know of, or have you seen used in productionp  pAs said, im interested in a combination of code syntax, loader tools and build tools.

Can ACCDB files be used as back ends for deployed applications and following on from that, what would be the best front endsp  pThe point being here is that if someone were to create an application similar to the one above not going to need even 1GB worth of storage space, create an installer package and distribute via CD or DVD what would be the best options for front and back endsp  pI had to write for university a java program that used plain text files as the storage medium.

If I press F5 to continue, I usually dont see the problem for some time and the application continues as before.p  pThere is nothing fancy happening with this text box.

Negative 236 pIs there any way by which I can specify minimum distance between nodesedges in force directed graphp  pI have some graphs in which one node is connected to hundreds of other nodes directly and in such cases it is really difficult to select a specific edge or node since edges and nodes are so close that onMouseEnter , onClick etc. events are not fired the way user expects it to be.p  pe.g. If nodeA and nodeB are really close, when I hover the nodeA and expect it to get highlighted , the nodeB is highlighted since event is fired for nodeB. Same is the case for edges when they are too close to each other. Basically it really gets confusing for the user to know which nodeedge exactly is being hovered or selected.p  pI know we can specify the edge length. That can solve this problem to some extent but it does not help when you have hundreds of nodes and edges.

Negative 236 pI have a UIScrollView and its child, a custom view, which has way more width than the UIScrollView. At certain times, I enlarge the custom view width only and I want to redraw only the part by which it was enlarged. Thats the whole problem. The rest is just details of how I try to achieve this.p  pAfter some searching, I found the property a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUIKitReferenceUIViewClassUIViewUIView.htmlapplerefoccinstpUIViewcontentMode relnofollowcodeUIView.contentModecodea, which should be exactly for this purpose. Ive played around with it e.g. setting it to a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUIKitReferenceUIViewClassUIViewUIView.htmlapplerefdoccrefUIViewContentMode relnofollowcodeUIViewContentModeLeftcodea but I couldnt get any effect out of this. Ive not used this property before, so its possible that I didnt use it correctly.p  pMy problem is that the codedrawRectCGRectrectcode method of the custom view always gets called with the complete size of the custom view, not just with the rect by which it was enlarged. This causes performance problems, becasue the drawing cycles take longer and longer the more the custom view grows.p  pWhat I do in my updating codep  precodedispatchasync dispatchgetmainqueue,      uiScrollView.contentSize  ...  increase width of contentSize     customView.frame  ...  increase width of customView accordingly      CGRect visibleRect  [uiScrollView convertRectuiScrollView.bounds toViewcustomView]      printfsetNeedsDisplayInRect sn, NSStringFromCGRectvisibleRect.UTF8String      [customView setNeedsDisplayInRectvisibleRect]  codepre  pHowever, the rect I specify above does not reach the drawRect method in the customView, where I also log the rect like thisp  precode void drawRectCGRectrect      printfdrawRect sn, NSStringFromCGRectrect.UTF8String       drawing code here      ...  codepre  pRepresentative original outputp  precode... setNeedsDisplayInRect 426, 0, 320, 192 setNeedsDisplayInRect 427, 0, 320, 192 setNeedsDisplayInRect 427, 0, 320, 192 setNeedsDisplayInRect 427, 0, 320, 192 drawRect 0, 0, 587, 192 codepre  pBackground I am trying to create a scrolling waveform view. When recording, the latest recorded waveform should be displayed. I could achieve this with simply a round buffer and a custom view, but after recording, the waveform track shall be displayed as well and the user shall be able to scroll using standard gestures, so I would like to also use the UIScrollViewcustomView UI structure while recording as well to stay consistent in the UI structure between the two modes of operation.p  pUpdatesp  pIt just occured to me that I try to redraw the visible part of the customView and not the part by which it was enlarged. However, that does not change the overall problem. Ive meanwhile tried it with the rect by which the custom view was enlarged, which is a 1coordinate unit wide rect in this case, but with the exact same problem drawRect still gets called with the complete size of the custom view to be redrawn.p  pThis also leads to the question The biggest part of my custom view is usually invisible because it is scrolled out of the displayed area. Why does iOS tell my custom view to redraw this anyways invisible areap

Negative 236 pI am torn between object oriented and vector based design. I love the abilities, structure and safety that objects give to the whole architecture.

Thats more than 100 times fasterp  pAs you can see, the OOP way gives me a lot of security that people wont be adding Volatility the wrong way, but the vector method is just so crazy fast Is there a design in which I can get both I am sure a lot of you have run into similar design choices, how did you work it outp  pThe choice of language here is immaterial. I know a lot of you would advise that use C or Java, and the code may run faster than vector based languages anyway. But thats not the point. I need to use Python, because I have a host of libraries not available in other languages. Thats my constraint. I need to optimize within it.p  pAnd I know, that a lot of people would suggest parallelization, gpgpu etc. But I want to maximize single core performance first, and then I can parallelize both the versions of code.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 236 pIm entirely new to Dart so excuse my ignorance.p  pLets say I was trying to model a tree which had frames and paragraphs. A frame could hold paragraphs, and other frames recursive.

Just wondering how one would use dartUI to display a recursive tree structure with mixed types like this. Can you do it via templatingbinding p  pEdit This tree structure is dynamic and changed at run time i.e. users can add frames and paragraphs. So what Im looking for is a method to generate the view from this model without the calls back to the server to generate new content structures.p  pI was thinking maybe the codetemplate iteratecode could be used to iterate over all the children of a Frame and somehow switch what element is inserted based on whether the child is a paragraph or frame.p

Negative 236 pWe have an access application. Few days ago, we decided to shift it on MySQL server. What we did is we setup Amazon RDS instance, install mysql there and connected our access frontend with MySQL server online. We used ODBC 5.2.2 Connector for linking the tables. We only have 5 tables and records in each table happens to be about 250. Only one table is huge that has 9095 columns and about 250 records and increasing. This is the main table and being used in most of our forms. We have like 16 forms. About 20 queries and macros. We are using MS Access 2013 for the front end app.p  pProblem here is after shifting it to online database server, the app performance has been decreased a lot. When we opens any forms, it takes like 1520 seconds to come up front and then shows records. When we press to go to next record it take much more time to show the next record. Internet connection isnt an issue as we are using 16mbps connection. Same goes with servers as we are using amazon RDS.p  pWe also tried setting up the MySQL Server 5.6 locally on one of our machine and used it as our backend database. The access app worked absolutely fine just like it used to perform when we had access database.p  pSo, I want to ask following questions p  ol liUsing Access Frontend with online MySQL is the right choice  Considering the performance. li liHow most of the people are using mysql as Access app database  they go either online or setup their own server in local area network.  Im new to access apps dont have idea about it. li liAccording to things I shared above about our app above, how can we optimize our app so that it works fast on online servers  li ol  pThanks in advance  p

Negative 236 pThe problem is that the source code distribution is not exactly the code that runs after installation. The installer, which runs when the site is accessed for the first time, generates a lot of code. Also, a running system stores some data in php source code e.g. user profiles  under the iuserprivilegesi directory rather than in the database. So, I have the following unsatisfactory possibilities.p  p1 Put the original source code under VC and edit it. In this case I have to do a fresh install and run the installer every time to see how my changes are working.p  p2 Put the installed source code after the installer has run under VC, and edit it. In this case I have immediate feedback, but I cant use that code for new installations. I also have to exclude everything that the running system writes in the source tree from the VC.p  pAny suggestions I am working with Vtiger CRM version 6.0Beta, but any tips relevant to version 5 would help.

Negative 236 pI have three UIViews one below another in my application.The UIViews data is filled by API responses. I want to hide the UIView when its corresponding API response is nil. I am checking the API response and if it is nil, I am setting [myview setHiddenYES] which hides the view but here is my problem.p  pSay, if the second view doesnt have any data, it is hidden but the views coordinate is still occupied and I get big blank space between my first and third view. p  pTo solve this problem, what I did was I used UIView animation method to move the third view in to the second views coordinate space if second view data is nil. p  pThis works fine for me but this kind of approach adds complexity to my code if I add fourth or fifth view. I am sure there are better solutions than my approach and would be helpful if you can guide me to a better approach than mine.p  pThank youp  pAmong the solutions provided I went with the solution provided by Jonah.at.GoDaddy which suited my app. Thank other too for providing great inputs.p

I really dont want to hold a list of subscribers in the model, which is against the principle of loose coupling in a way. But if I only add a callback function to the codeTestModelcode in the codesubscribecode method, Im not able to access the codethis.stringcode variable in the codeTestViewcode. Because codethiscode points to the TestModel which has called the codetalkcode method. My workaround is the codeselfcode which leads to the need of a subscriberlist in the Model.p  pI also tried to initialize a self variable outside of the codeTestViewcode functions, in the codeTestViewcode function which is called and returned by RequireJS. But this function is only called once, and therefore the variable acts like a static variable in Java and is not unique in every instance of codeTestViewcode.p  pIs there a possibility to get a codeselfcodecodethiscode variable in the codetalkcode functions to access the string without handling it over by the codeTestModelcode like its done nowp

Negative 236 pBasically I have an Ajax request instantiated by a button where it is passed to my controller, and then that controller returns a list of objects. I initially was thinking whether this could be done by loading the returned ajax object into the JSTL forEach loop, but I think that cannot be done after some research.  This is my ajax request which loads sighting based on a valuep  precodeedit the sighting based on the username value      this.onclick, .editsighting, function         username  .editsighting.val         .getpageContext.request.contextPathgetSighting  username, functionsightings              load returned object somewhere                codepre  pThis is my controller which handles the ajax request and responds returning a list of objects sightingp  precodeRequestMappinggetSightingusername public ResponseBody ListltSightinggt getSightingModel model, PathVariable String username       ListltSightinggt sightings  sightingsService.getSightingsusername     model.addAttributesightings, sightings     return sightings  codepre  pAnd essentially I would like to load the returned objects into a for each loop or something that would display the object fields. for example  something like that. My for each loopp  precodeltcforEach varsighting itemssightings gt         ltcout valuesighting.namegt lt load some sighting value gt  ltcforEachgt codepre  pSo essentially what I am trying to achieve is, load multiple or one sightings into a modal type thing when a button is instantiated.  p

Negative 236 pIm writting a Java 1.7 application to be running on Windows.

Negative 236 pI need some help understanding the follow bit of code, and where I might be going wrong.

This while loop goes through each element in the array, as long as it doesnt see a NULL or an ASTERIX, and Xors the value. So if i were to say that the element[1] and element [2] of pSentence were say A and B so the while loop, loops twice, and checkSum is Xor the value A, then do i Xor their ascii values together to get a value for checksum Is that how that part of the function works p  pSo A ascii is 0x41 B ascii is 0x42p  precodecalculatedChecksum  pSentence which is A  codepre  p 0100 0001p  pand thenp  precodecalculatedChecksum  Sentence which is B codepre  p0100 0001 Current value of calcChecksump  p0100 0010 ASCII of Bp  p 0000 0011p  pIs that correctp  pNow this last function is where most of my problem is.

Negative 236 pIm creating a Vector2 class in Java, and have an issuep  precodepublic class Vector2      public static final Vector2 ZERO  new Vector20,0     ...  codepre  pin another class, Id like to call ZERO like thisp  precodeVector2 myVector  Vector2.ZERO initialize to zero myVector.addmyOtherVector myVector is now the sum of Vector2.ZERO and myOtherVector codepre  pHowever, this behaves undesirably myVector just becomes Vector2.ZEROand thus unchangeablerather than being initialized to the zero value and then being free to work with as I wish. To get the behavior I want, I needp  precodeVector2 myVector  new Vector2Vector2.Zero initialize to zero with copy constructor codepre  pIm a little confused by Javas semantics here i.e someVector essentially seems to be a pointer rather than an actual object, so I have to create a new object and explicity copy the values. After reading up on that, I understand theres a lot of confusion on that topic. Is there a simple way to achieve the syntax Im looking for or should I just stick with option 2 If there isnt, is there a way to prevent the assignment in option 1 Its going to give me some hard to catch errors later if I dont stop it at compile time.p  pEdit Vector2 isnt immutable. What Id like is for Vector2.ZERO to be a constant value I can use for assignments, but then manipulate those new variables normally. Right now if I do that assignment in multiple places, then all of those are just pointers to the same object which because its static just accumulates the changes.p  pFor example, in Unity when working with vectors I would say something likep  precodeVector2 myFirstVector  Vector2.ZERO first vector, initialized to zero ...do some stuff to change the value of myFirstVector, Vector2.ZERO unchanged   Vector2 mySecondVector  Vector2.ZERO second vector, also initialized to zero ...do some stuff to mySecondVector codepre

For example, on iPad I have to have a 768 x 1024 and a 768 x 1004.  With 8 images required just for the iPad launch image, the file size of my app is huge, as each iPad launch image is between 1.5MB and 5MB.

So I implemented this and it improves the fit over multiple recursions.p  pMy question is this If optim is already optimising over the parameter space and spitting out an optimal answer for that starting condition, why is the fit improved by using it recursively, repeatedly This seems unintuitive.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 236 pIm curious if MySQL will internally optimize a query that has two or more codeWHERE X IN Ycode conditions on the same column.p  pAs a quick background of why I ask The application in question uses a PHP querybuilder and conditions are added to the query in two different spots. Permissionbased restrictions are added to a query automatically first in one area of the code. In a separate area, that restricted codeSELECTcode query object is retrieved without need for knowledge of what was previously done and additional userchosen filter restrictions are added in addition to the permissionbased restrictions potentially resulting in two codeWHEREcode conditions on one field.p  pFor a small contrived example, assume there is a simple table likep  precodeCREATE TABLE users      userId INT12 NOT NULL autoincrement,     managerUserId INT12,     name VARCHAR16     primary KEY userId  codepre  pObviously there would be appropriate indexes added as wellp  pSo, when building up the codeSELECTcode query, wed start with codeSELECT  FROM userscode initially.p  pSay, for example, the user making the query has access to the following managerUserId values 11,22,33,44,55,66,77.br  The query builder will automatically impose a codeWHERE managerUserId IN 11,22,33,44,55,66,77code addition to  the bare query. Now we have the query codeSELECT  FROM users WHERE managerUserId IN 11,22,33,44,55,66,77code represented by our query object.p  pHowever, the user specified they only wanted information about managerUserId values 33,55,77 at this time.br  Since this is a user requested filter and not an accessrelated restriction, the query is modified at a different point in the code to add codeAND managerUserId IN 33,55,77code to the codeWHEREcode clause.p  pAt this point we now have the final queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM   users WHERE  managerUserId IN 11,22,33,44,55,66,77 AND    managerUserId IN 33,55,77 codepre  pNow, it seems obvious we only need to actually query on the union of 11,22,33,44,55,66,77 and 33,55,77.p  pstrongMy question is Does MySQL know how to internally optimize the above query to simply be the equivalent ofstrongp  precodeSELECT  FROM   users WHERE  managerUserId IN 33,55,77 codepre  pIn my case, the first accessbased restriction could potentially contain up to 100200 values while the second one, in most cases, would probably only contain a dozen or fewer values. Seems to me an easy enough thing MySQL could detect an optimize but Im not sure how to confirm that is the case or what the potential performance issues with including both clauses might be.p
Negative 236 pI am trying to define an codeinterfacecoded procedure as a typebound procedure in a Fortran codetypecode definition, but it seems it doesnt work as one would expect. Consider the following modulep  precodemodule examplemodule implicit none private  interface addthem   module procedure addtheminteger,addthemreal end interface addthem  type, public  foo   integer, private  a1,b2   real, private  c4.,d5. contains   procedure, public  add gt addthem end type foo  contains subroutine addthemintegerself,x classfoo, intentin  self integer, intentin  x print ,selfaselfbx end subroutine addtheminteger  subroutine addthemrealself,x classfoo, intentin  self real, intentin  x print ,selfcselfdx end subroutine addthemreal end module examplemodule codepre  pand the corresponding program that uses the modulep  precodeprogram example use examplemodule implicit none typefoo  foofoo call foofooadd1 call foofooadd2. end program example codepre  pI would expect this to compile and results should be 4 and 11. However, gfortran reports the following errorp  precodeprocedure, public  add gt addthem          1 Error addthem must be a module procedure or an external procedure with an explicit interface at 1 codepre  pA workaround is to use codegenericcode typebound procedure instead of an codeinterfacecoded one, so that the module is as followsp  precodemodule examplemodule implicit none private  type, public  foo   integer, private  a1,b2   real, private  c4.,d5. contains   generic, public  add gt addtheminteger,addthemreal   procedure, private  addtheminteger,addthemreal end type foo  contains subroutine addthemintegerself,x classfoo, intentin  self integer, intentin  x print ,selfaselfbx end subroutine addtheminteger  subroutine addthemrealself,x classfoo, intentin  self real, intentin  x print ,selfcselfdx end subroutine addthemreal end module examplemodule codepre  pThis works as expected. However, I cannot use a codegenericcode procedure. The above is just a simplified example to demonstrate the problem, but in my actual code addthem cannot be a codegenericcode procedure because foo is actually a derivedtype and addthem overrides a procedure defined in the parent type gfortran at least does not allow codegenericcode procedures overriding base procedures. To bypass this restriction, I thought I should use an codeinterfacecode instead, but as you can see in the above example, although addthem is defined correctly, compiler complains that addthem must be a module procedure or an external procedure with an explicit interface.p  pAny help would be appreciated thanks in advance.p

In C I did the following, but I cant figure out how to get this done in Python.p  pHere is my current code.p  precode         Test that there are only valid characters in the pattern.         charPattern  listpattern         expression  list01234567890abcdef          for currentChar in pattern             if lencharPattern  pattern[11].index0123456789abcdef  1                 self.assertTrueFalse, logger.failedThe invalid character   currentChar   was found in the IRCode pattern for   ircodeenter code here codepre  pAny ideassuggestionscode examples are welcome.p  pThanks.p

Negative 236 pI try to develop a minimalistic BluetoothChat for Android with Phonegap. The Plugin is based on the Android SDK Example of the BluetoothChat as you can see in the example code. p  pThe native BluetoothChat works fine.  The Problem is, when i call my writeFunction, the ConnectedThread is always null, although the connection is established. p  pI cant recognize where it is set to null again, after the State was set to 3 STATECONNECTED. p  pSo when i run the program native on android, it works fine and the state during write is always 3, but when i use my phonegap plugin rConnectedThread becomes null  p

Negative 236 pIve been debugging a heap corruption in a software. I can write data to the heap and get control over some pointers. I can achieve my goal of executing code without knowing this but it confused me a bit.p  pThe problem is that I cant find in which heap the block that Im writing to is , nor the heap segments.p  pI used  codeheap x [address] and heap x v [address]code under Windbg and they didnt give me any result. I know that some heaps may reserve another heap segment when no uncommitted space is available in the first one . However, Ive dumped all heap segments and I couldnt find anyone with a base address similar to the one Im looking for.p  pIt seems a little bit weird to me that theres no process or application specific heap having these blocks p

Negative 236 pI have a webpage which is visible nicely at a given width. I want it to remain at that width only. It can zoom in and out but I want the content to remain fixed with respect to that width.p  pThe content of the webpage can be responsive also. Thats why I want it to remain fixed. Because I dont want the layout of the webpage to change with changing viewports of desktop or mobiles.p  pRed frame is viewport and green frame is webpage. Now image 1 shows a webpage with the given width. Images 2 shows webpage which has been scaled down to fit in the viewport but still has its content intact. Or it can be image 3 where the viewport is small and shows the same webpage with scrollbars.p  pI actually need this concept so that I can leave some markingssome points with fixed coordinates on the page. And the markings remain fixed at their position despite of changing viewports.p  pI tried doingp  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidth1286gt 1286 is the given fixed width here. codepre  pIt solved the problem a bit but not totally.p  pIs this thing possiblep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4aHCy.jpg altfitting webpage inside viewportp  pEDITp  pI think I was not clear enough.

Negative 236 pI understand that local variables are not initialised automatically in C, so before using them, you should always assign a value to them. However, at least in simple cases, the compiler should warn you in case you forget it. Im more or less relying on and referring to a hrefhttpwww.learncpp.comcpptutorial13afirstlookatvariables relnofollowthis articlea.p  pGiven this program, Id assume to get a warning when sending codexcode to codestdoutcode...p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  int mainint argc, const char  argv[]     int x   stdcout ltlt x    return 0  codepre  p...but no warning pops up. If, however, I run the static analyzer, I do get the expected warning emFunction call argument is an uninitialized valueem.p  pI compile amp run using Xcode 5.1 with the Apple LLVM 5.1 compiler. I use the standard build settings from Xcodes command line project template C, the language dialects are set to emGNU99em for C and emGNU11em C.p  pThe emUninitialized Variablesem option is set to emYes Aggressiveem codeWconditionaluninitializedcode. Switching to just emYesem codeWuninitializedcode raises the warning emVariable x is uninitialized when used hereem. strongQuestion Part 1strong Why does the warning not show with the default setting codeWconditionaluninitializedcode The documentation in Xcode suggests that the aggressive option finds more issuesp  blockquote   pYou can toggle between the normal uninitialized value checking or the more aggressive conservative checking which finds more issues but the checking is much stricter.p blockquote  pStrangely enough, when I run the program, the value is always code0code, so for some reason, it seems to be initialised. strongQuestion Part 2strong Why is thatp

If this image does not have too many comments this happens very quickly so nobody gets notice. But, when I am changing to the next image but I change my mind in the middle of the next image and get back to the image where I am. I get wrong image comments for the image where I am.p  pEverything happens if I go back in the gallery. p  pHow can I manage this Is possible to know if the cell is completely displayed If I could know when the cell is completely displayed I could call the webService method and download that information.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 236 pAbout 2 years ago, I made a program that used optionmenus in Python 3.2. Between then and now, I used 3.3.2, and 3.3.4. I ran that program a few days ago with 3.3.4, but the optionmenu was disattached from its button. Instead of the menu being anchored to the button, it was suspended about half a screen below the button. Then I ran it with 3.2, and got the same result. However, I ran it with 3.3.2, and got the expected result with the menu anchored to the button. Is there some reason for thisp

They suddenly become inconsistent and they are not state variables.

Negative 236 pI have designed the following list. Now I want to keep its exact appearance but put more space inbetween the lielements. Unfortunately with paddingbottom it moves the borderbottom in a way that it does NOT stay exact in the middle between two elements but glues to the bottom, as it is supposed to do, I see that. But I would love to put it in a manner that it stays EXACTELY in the middle of the two neigbored lielements. Right now I am stuck. i know I could mess around with the html source but I would rather want to keep it clean and do this only with CSS.

Negative 236 pI am working with the jQuery fixedheadertable plugin.

Negative 236 pIm working on what should be an extremely simple guess my number game in Javascript, however, I cant get it to work correctly. p  pThe program is supposed to choose a random integer between 1 and 10 and allow the user to try and guess that number as many times as it takes to get it right. If the user guesses a number thats lower than the correct one, the program is supposed to display a your guess is too low message, this is the same for when the guess is too high, or correct. The program must display the message on the webpage, not in an alert or any type of popup. Also, the program is supposed to keep a running list of the numbers that have been guessed by the user and display them on the page each time the user makes a guess I want this list to display below my  heading Here are the numbers youve guessed so far.

Negative 236 pIm writing a front end application in MS Access 2010 saved as a standard accdb which users will only be able to use Access runtime to open. Our IT department has kindly installed the 2013 runtime rather than the 2010 runtime on a test machine for me to check my development on.p  pIm having some issues getting anything to show in Runtime on this machine, yet when I use the runtime switch in a shortcut on MY machine, everything works as expected. What is happening on the test machine is a dialogue warning of A potential security concern has been identified comes up with OK and Cancel. If I click on OK, the database opens as far as I can tell, and code thats in the formopen event of the startup form runs checks to see the location of the file isnt a network drive to ensure that users copy the front end to their desktop and a version control query to match the client with the latest version of backend. However the form never appears, and I get no errorscrashes or other unexpected events.p  pWhat could I have done wrong, or is it connected with the security warning My gut says thats a red herring as the location check and version checking code does run, ie if I run it from the network drive then it gives the msgbox it was meant to.p  pMany thanks, this is my first time using runtime.p

Negative 236 pIm trying to figure out a good and fast solution to the following problemp  pI have two models Im working with, lets call them players and teams. A player can be on multiple teams and a team can have multiple players. Im working on creating a UI element on a form that allows a user to select multiple teams checkboxes. As the user is selecting or deselecting teams, Id like to display the teams grouped by the players.p  pSo for examplesp  ol lipIf the selected teams have no players that intersect, each team would have its own section. pli lipIf the user selects two teams and they have the same players, there would be one section containing the names of the two teams and all the players.pli lipIf TEAMA has players [1, 2, 4, 5] and TEAMB has players [1, 3, 5, 6]. There would be the following sections SECTIONX  [TEAMA, TEAMB, 1, 5], SECTIONY  [TEAMA, 2, 3], SECTION Z  [TEAMB, 3, 5]pli ol  pI hope thats clear. Essentially, I want to find the teams that players have in common and group by that. I was thinking maybe there is a way to do this by navigating a bipartite graph Not exactly sure how though and I might be overthinking it. I was hoping to do this by creating some type of data structure on the server and using it on the client. I would love to hear your suggestions and I appreciate any help you can givep

Negative 236 pI have created a location based app, and it works fine on the device. But on the simulator there appears to be sporadic issues where the location services just stops working.

So this confirms that it is not a coding issuep  pUsually I can fix the issue, after a few attempts of resetting simulator, deleting derived data, double checking I have setup a simulated location under edit scheme. It usually takes a few attempts of trying this various techniques to get it working. But today I cannot get it working at all on the simulator. p  pNow I am sure after playing about with for longer, I will eventually get this working again on the simulator, but I would like to know the root cause of this issue. I am getting tired of every morning, repeating this routine of resetting sim, deleting data, as it is wasting time that could be spent actually coding.p  pIs this an issue with the Xcode 6.1 simulator Why does this seem to happen quite often and does anyone else have a better solution to this issuep

As reflected in comments, subsequent test on 4.4.4 emulator is not able to replicate the error. strongSo far, error only observed on actual Samsung G5 with 4.4.4.strongp  h3UPDATEh3  pBased on a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27891436incorrectjavaopensourceviewwhensteppingineclipsewithlivedeviceconneclabor intensive debug step processa of mapping a good source view 4.4.4 emulator with the Samsung incorrect source view, we have narrowed in on the cause of the NPE. The app throws an NPE when it calls StartTaskActivity.setActivityVisible, which eventually runs into a null object. Because of the limits to the tracing process, I cant say with certainty what that object is, but my guess is that it is the window, or view. The line of code that throws it is mDecor.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE line 4355 in Samsung  line 4143 in Emulator of Activity.java. So, technically, some part of the mDecor object is null. p  pWill probably take a different approach to achieve our goal, since we cannot determine why the Samsung v4.4.4 throws NPE when no other deviceemulator seems to, including Samsung v4.4.2. Perhaps even though this question is unresolved, it might be useful to others in the future.p

I need to show each partys ratio for each state and city also countrywide. p  pThese are my thoughts on the designp  pThere is a separate table for each partythere will be 30 tables and there are 2 columns state and city. So every vote inserted into the relevant partys table with a state and city information so I can query election results for countrywide or for statescities. But I have to insert every vote as a row.. As I always need number of total votes for each city, inserting every vote as a row seems like an overkill.p  pThere is a separate table for each partycity so queries will be fast e.g. table names democratsseattle, democratsnewyork etc.... But that makes 50x10  500 tablesp  pThere is one table for each party and it has just 3 columns state, city and totalvotes. I will insert 50states  10cities500 row in each table. And when an user sends a vote only totalvotes will increment in the relevant partystatecity row.

Turns out I get the exact same sized binary from the second link from the top, and the same calls for the necesarry libraries thus same errors.p  pstrongCurrent thesisstrongp  pIt might be that the phantomjs binary is seeing the correct lib files given Update 1, but the provided Heroku ones arent up to date enough for the binary to run correctly.  Or it could still be missing the library files.p  pEither way, I guess Id need to somehow get phantomjs to use the library files Ive provided, and Im not sure how Id get to do that.p

Negative 236 pI have a Python app with many modules. Theres a YAML config file which contains configuration settings for each module. In each modules stronginitstrong, I load the config and then process it into a config dictionary for that module.p  pThe processing is ugly right now. Dozens and dozens of lines at the beginning of each module with a lot of stuff likep  precodeif foo not in config     config[foo]  bar codepre  porp  precodeif foo in config     config[foo]  stringtolistconfig[foo] else     config[foo]  list codepre  petc.p  pSo now I want to write a centralized config processing method that each module can use. Im thinking that I want to use a YAMLformatted string to specify what the final config should look like. Which settings are mandatory, default values, object types, etc.p  pIm thinking the config specification in each module could be something like this with the typedefaultrequired valuesp  precodeconfigtemplate  MySection                        setting1 int0                        setting2 stringNonerequired                        setting3 int10 codepre  pSo far, so good. My real question is whether theres any way for me to save this config specification thing in each module in a docstring for stronginitstrong or something. Im thinking that since Im essentially defining exactly what the module expects for its config, along with the defaults and the types, if I could store this config thing in the docstring then I ought to be able to write something andor configure sphinx to pretty it up for the documentationp  pSo I wonder if this approach sounds sane in general, and, if so, is there a way I can store this config info in the docstring to get it to work as double dutyp  pEDIT I considered setting up a dictionary with default values first, and certainly that will take care of the defaults. But there are a lot of cases where I need the values to be of a certain type. For example, maybe some have to be a list, but if a single item is entered into the config file it will be read as a string, so I need the config processor to convert the string to a list with that string as its only item.p  pEDIT 2 The reason I was asking about the docstring is because I was thinking that my config specification would essentially tell a programmer what this modules was expecting in terms of a config dictionary, so if I can do it in the docstring then I can just specify it once and have the module use it for its config as well as have it appear in the sphinx documentation. But if thats not possible, then so be it. I can use it in a variable like in my example above and then write the docstring manually.p  pThanks Brianp
Negative 236 pI have some paragraphs entered by users stored in a string in a collection but the string has some rough formatting with new line characters. When I present that same paragraph later after accessing it from the collection, how do I have it retain that formatting If I have the data object and I just do code dataparagraph code it ignores the newlines and just spits out the string. p  pIs there a way to retain this formatting better when I reprint the data to the userp  pEdit  p  pHere is some additional information p  pThe text paragraph I am trying to present formatted is just a codetextareacode input through Autoforms. People might post a paragraph with codencode characters but  the whole string is getting stored in the collection. p  pJust as an example I pass the data in through IronRouter p  precodeSingleParagraphController  BaseController.extend     template  singleParagraphPage,     waitOn  function          return Meteor.subscribesingleParagraph, this.params.id     ,     data function          return Paragraphs.findOneid  this.params.id       codepre  pAnd then I want to be able to access the individual paragraph like p  precodelttemplate namesingleParagraphPagegt     lth2gt  name  lth2gt     ltpgt  paragraph  ltpgt lttemplategt codepre  pBut it needs to have the same formatting with the new lines when they entered it initially into the text area.

Negative 236 pI have a table that relies on insertion order bad legacy design that I cannot change and is having transient entities being inserted in the wrong order. The table in question is called Mean which is a child entity of Belief. When codesession.savebeliefcode is called, the action is cascaded to the child mean entities which is stored as a list in the belief class. the Mean entities are stored in the appropriate order in the belief.getMeans List, but once persisted to the database, they are inserted in order of their composite key. so for example, if there are 3 Mean entities to be inserted with the following order and composite keysp  precode[1, 1], [1, 3], [1, 2] codepre  pThey will be inserted ordered by the composite keys like sop  precode[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3] codepre  pAny idea as to what might be causing this I thought Hibernate was supposed to insert based on the order they appear in the List I even tried running session.save on each Mean entity individually to see if that would make a difference, but it didnt.p  pI appreciate your helpp  pEDIT So what I ended up doing was adding a new column to the Mean table called colindex which holds the column index of the Mean in the resulting matrix. I used javax.persistence.OrderBy annotation with the new colindex column so the List of Mean entities comes back in the appropriate order. Although, this still does not fix the insertion order problem, and I would still like to have an answer for that. However for now, this solution will have to suffice. p

Now I need to trace the curve and find the values of y for all other x.p  pAny idea how it can be done using calculus and how do I program for it p  pI am trying to do using applying tangent lines but I am not entirely able to think it through.p  pExample Suppose I plot a graph using x,y values , it will be a asymmetric curve. Now once the curve is drawn. The same curve can be used to approximate values on different data set which show the same trend of curve. So if I am given only one point say y  40 at x 10 , how do I get values of Y for other x for the data set showing similar trend of curve.p  precode1,6.81 2,5.516 3,6.088 4,8.025 5,6.89 6,9.98 7,8.511 8,8.458 9,8.172 10,8.467 11,10.294 12,11.106 13,10.517 14,7.905 15,8.141 16,9.608 17,8.774 codepre

I am getting the following errorp  precodeAn unhandled exception of type System.AccessViolationException occurred in SQUiRE Sql QUery REtriever v1.exe codepre  pAdditional information Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.p  pI have been tracking this for a while and thought I fixed it, but my solution was a false positive.  So I am using a try...catch block that is breaking but not returning anything.  Let me know if you all see anything that I am missing.  I usually break on this line templateSheet  templateBook.Sheets[tabName] and on the same tabName.  The tab is not locked or restricted so It can be written to and works more than half of the time.  p  precodepublic void ExportToExcelDataSet dataSet, Excel.Workbook templateBook, int i, int h, Excel.Application excelApp string filePath,               try                       lock this.GetType                              Excel.Worksheet templateSheet                  check to see if the template is already open, if its not then open it,                 if it is then bind it to work with it                 if fileOpenTest                  templateBook  excelApp.Workbooks.OpenfilePath                  else                  templateBook  Excel.WorkbookSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.BindToMonikerfilePath                    Grabs the name of the tab to dump the data into from the Query Dumps Tab                 string tabName  lstQueryDumpSheet.Items[i].ToString                 templateSheet  templateBook.Sheets[tabName]                                      Copy DataTable                 foreach System.Data.DataTable dt in dataSet.Tables                                       Copy the DataTable to an object array                     object[,] rawData  new object[dt.Rows.Count  1, dt.Columns.Count]                       Copy the values to the object array                     for int col  0 col lt dt.Columns.Count col                                              for int row  0 row lt dt.Rows.Count row                          rawData[row, col]  dt.Rows[row].ItemArray[col]                                             Calculate the final column letter                     string finalColLetter  string.Empty                     string colCharset  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ                     int colCharsetLen  26                      if dt.Columns.Count gt colCharsetLen                      finalColLetter  colCharset.Substringdt.Columns.Count  1  colCharsetLen  1, 1                       finalColLetter  colCharset.Substringdt.Columns.Count  1  colCharsetLen, 1                      Grabs the full cell address from the Query Dump sheet, splits on the  and                      pulls out only the cell address i.e., addressa3 becomes a3                     string dumpCellString  lstQueryDumpText.Items[i].ToString                     string dumpCell  dumpCellString.Split.Last                      Refers to the range in which we are dumping the DataSet.

Negative 236 pI took adrien grands java repository providing JNI to the original LZ4 native code.p  pI want to compress multiple files under a given input directory, but LZ4 doesnt support multiple file compression like in java zip package so I tried another approach where I thought of to tar all my input files and pipe it as input to LZ4 compressor, and I used Jtar java package for taring all my input files. strongIs there any other better way other than thisstrong p  pI came across many sample codes to compress some strings and how to correctly implement the LZ4 compressor and decompressor. strongNow I wanted to know how to actually implement it for multiple filesstrong strongI also wanted to clarify whether Im going in the correct direction.strong p  pAfter taring all files, according to sample code usage explanation Ive to convert my tared file now to byte array to provide it to compressor module. I used apachecommonioutil package for this purpose. So considering Ive many files as input and which results in a tar of huge size, converting it always to byte array seems ineffective according to me. strongI wanted to first know whether this is effective or not or is there any better way of using LZ4 package better than thisstrong p  pAnother problem that I came across was the end result. After compression of the tared files I would get an end result like MyResult.lz4 file as output but I was not able to decompress it using the archive manager  Im using ubuntu  as it doesnt support this format. strongIm also not clear about the archive and compression format that I have to use here. I also want to know what format should the end result be in.strong So now Im speaking from an user point of view, consider a case where Im generating a backup for the user if I provide himher with traditional .zip, .gz or any known formats, the user would be in a position to decompress it by himself. As I know LZ4 doesnt mean Ive to expect the user also should know such format right He may even get baffled on seeing such a format. So this means a conversion from .lz4 to .zip format also seems meaningless. I already see the taring process of all my input files as a time consuming process, strongso I wanted to know how much it affects the performance.strong As Ive seen in java zip package compressing multiple input files didnt seem to be a problem at all. So next to lz4 I came across Apache common compress and TrueZIP. I also came across several stack overflow links about them which helped me learn a lot. As of now I really wanted to use LZ4 for compression especially due its performance but I came across these hurdles. Can anyone who has a good knowledge about LZ4 package provide solutions to all my queries and problems along with a simple implementation. Thanks.p  pTime I calculated for an input consisting of many files,br  Time taken for taring  4704 msbr  Time taken for converting file to byte array  7 msbr  Time Taken for compression  33 msbrp

Negative 236 pIm attempting to write some boot code for a MIPS Malta board, emulated in QEMU.p  pAs I understand it, the Malta board loads 4MB of code from flash to a specific position in physical RAM 0x1fc00000, which is 0xbfc00000 in the MIPS program address space the MIPS32 reset interrupt location. Im trying to produce the code that will be loaded and run at this location.p  pI have a simple assembly program which just loops foreverp  precode        .text start         b start codepre  pWhen I assemble this with the GNU assembler, I get an ELF file with a .text section containing this code.
