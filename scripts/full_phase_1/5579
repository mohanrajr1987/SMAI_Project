Positive 5579 pI have a test script written in python robot framework which navigates through a website and tests its pages. The website sometimes needs to refresh all its content from server, i.e. it needs a NoCache Refresh. p  pRobot Framework selenium2library has a codereload pagecode method which simply performs a RefreshIfModified. In Python I can use codedriver.refreshcode which does the same. p  pI tried codePress Keycode in robot framework and codedriver.sendkeysKeys.COMMAND  Keys.F5code and codedriver.geturlcode in python none of them was successfulp  pAny idea how to do that p  pTo clarify, a codeNoCache Refreshcode, retrieves all the website data from its server regardless of its changes on the server, but a codeRefreshIfModifiedcode first sends a request to the server and asks for changes, then it just requests to retrieve modified data.p

Positive 5579 pI have been developing my integration tests using Selenium Webdriver so far, but quite recently I decided to explore the techniques for developing them using the custom libraries and classes of my web app.p  pI wrote an integration test which needed some data from the httpContext class I am using .net, validate a session variable and based on that it redirected to a particular URL with response data in json format.p  pThe above in terms of a browser based test using Selenium Webdriver involved getting the web page which had a few links and by clicking any of the links returned the expected json response.p  pThe browser based test took 15 minutes to develop and verify.p  pThe native API based test took 1 hour to develop and verify and 3 hours of searching over google and stackoverflow regarding mocking or not mocking httpContext.p  pIn a generic scenario, lets just exclude the research time of 3 hours. Still the native API tests took way more longer to develop than the browser automated one.p  pSo in your experience, is it better to keep the number of native API based IT at a minimum or are there any scenarios where they will yield greater ROI as compared to Selenium Webdriver based integration tests.p

It should be possible to do things significantly simpler with closures. p  pAnyone have any referencesexamples of this problem solved nicely with preferably groovy or scala p  pEdit I did not know Object Mother was the name of the pattern, but its the one Im having troubles with When the object structure to be generated by the Object Mother is sufficiently complex, youll always end up with a fairly complex internal structure inside the Object Mother itself or by composing multiple Object Mothers. Given a sufficiently large target structure Say 30 classes, finding structured ways to implement the object mothers is really hard. Now that I know the name of the pattern i can google it better though  p
Negative 5579 pI was looking for a portable script or command line program that can synchronize two MySQL databases schema. I am not looking for a GUI based solution because that cant be automated or run with the buiddeployment tool.p  pBasically what it should do is scan database1 and database2.

Therefore sorting is not speed efficient I have to preserve the order of the array.pli lipThe integers are all over the place, so a bitarray as a lookup solution is not feasible.pli lipI want to avoid temporary allocations during the search at all costs.pli ul  pMy current solution looks roughly like thisp  precode  int numuniques  0   int uniques[16]   int startpos  0    while numuniques  N ampamp startpos lt arraylength         a temporary used later.     int insertposition       Get next element.     int element  array[startpos]       check if the element exist. If the element is not found      return the position where it could be inserted while keeping      the array sorted.      if binarysearch uniques, element, numuniques, ampinsertposition              insert the new unique element while preserving         the order of the array.        insertintoarray uniques, element, insertposition        uniques         codepre  pThe binarysearch  insert into array algorithm gets the job done, but the performance is not great.

Negative 5579 pCurrently I have code like the following simplified somewhat. Eventually, Ive added more and more new classes like D1D2, and I think its time to do some refactoring to make it more elegant. The goal of course is to make adding new class Dx use as little duplicate code as possible. At least, the duplicate parts of calling codeFileImporter.importcode inside the singleton method codeDx.importcode should be factored out.p  precodemodule FileImporter   def self.importmainwindow, viewers     ...     importer  yield file   delegate to D1D2 for preparing the importer object     ...   end end  class D1   def self.importmainwindow     viewers  [V11, ]   D1 specific viewers     FileImporter.importmainwindow, viewers do file       importer  self.newfile       ...   D1 specific handling of importer       return importer     end   end end  class D2   def self.importmainwindow     viewers  [V21,v22, ]   D2 specific viewers     FileImporter.importmainwindow, viewers do file       importer  self.newfile       ...   D2 specific handling of importer       return importer     end   end end   client code calls D1.import... or D2.import... codepre  pEssentially codeFileImporter.importcode is the common part, with codeDx.importcode being the variation. Im not sure how to refactor these singleton methods. What is the common strongRubystrong way of doing thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong some comments were added into code above, hopefully make my intension clearer ...p  pOriginally, Ive left out code I thought not significant to avoid confusion. I should have mentioned that the code above was also the result of refactoring class D1 and D2 by moving common part out and into module codeFileImportercode. The purpose of codeD1.importcode and codeD2.importcode was mainly to create objects of proper class and possibly followed by some classspecific handling before returning from the block. codeFileImporter.importcode is mainly the common logic, within which at some point would yield to specific class for generating the importer object.p  pI feel that class D1 and D2 and looks really similar and it should be possible to further refactor them. For example, they both call codeFileImporter.importcode to supply a block, within which both create an object of itself.p  pstrongSolutionstrong Originally I didnt realize you could call base classs singleton methods simply by calling codesupercode from within derived classs corresponding singleton methods. That was really the main problem I had and was not able to go with that route. So Ive accepted makevoid answer as it indeed makes creating new derived classes more easily. p  pUsing a common base class is an elegant refactoring solution, but one problem with that is all new derived classes would already use up the one base class quota. Ive came to this class macro method which provides even more concise results from the derived class perspective.p  precodemodule FileImporter   def self.includedmod     mod.extend ClassMethods   end    module ClassMethods     def importerviewerviewers, ampblk       viewers  viewers       blk  blk        class ltlt self         def importmainwindow           if blk.nil             FileImporter.importmainwindow, viewers do file               self.newfile             end           else             FileImporter.importmainwindow, viewers, ampblk           end               end       end     end   end    def self.importmainwindow, viewers, multitrue     ...     importer  yield file   delegate to D1D2 for preparing the importer object     ...   end end  class D1   include FileImporter   importerviewer [V11, ] do     ...

Negative 5579 pIve currently completed one of two phases of a project that required I write database information to XML using C. While use of a third party tool was used to do the actually formatting of XML tags and data, I still had to design a model along with business logic to take the database tables and map them into XML structures. p  pFor this I ended up creating an individual class for each XML structure, resulting in a large amount of classes 75. Each class had the knowledge of how to read its associated table and serialize itself to XML through the third party tool. In the end the system worked very well  on time and budget  and output errors were extremely easy to find.p  pPhase two is almost identical however instead of formatted text it will be binary data. So while I am still considering utilizing the same strategy used in phase one, I would like to inquire, is a better method or design pattern that would lend itself to this problem Particularly, due to the large amount of dependancies in some of the XML classes in phase one, unit testing was very difficult. p

In order to identify the related record of the object in the database I have to know its primary key. I use surrogate keys in my database schema.p  pIs it a good practice to pass the surrogate keys to the caller, so that it is possible to identify the records in the database in subsequent calls Caller retrieves object, caller modifies object, caller calls WCF update method I know that surrogate keys should normally not be used outside the database. If that is not a good idea, what other options do I have p  pAny advice is greatly apreciated.p
Negative 5579 pi have sniffed a file upload to find out tcp segments. i see a dup ack and and fast retransmission in the ethereal output. i want to verify that the timer for retransmission of this packet is indeed the one that is indicated by jacobsons formula. i have the timestamps for all segments. what portion of my linux source should i study to find out the retransmission timer value calculation algorithm used by my system. if it is the same as jacobsons algorithm i want to know the value of alpha for the retransmission timer.p
Negative 5579 pRight now I have several methods in my model which all fetch the same object at their beginning the models parent class. I would like to do this automatically and execute some code beforehand.p  pI would like to say execute fetchParent before you call the methods getParentId, getParentTable and mayChange.p  pIt it not sufficient to set this parentobject at initialization, or as a class variable, as the parent can change at runtime.p

Negative 5579 pI have 43 text files that consume 232.2 MB on disk 232,129,355 bytes for 43 items. what to read them in to memory see code below. The problem I am having is that each file which is about 5.3mb on disk is causing python to use an additional 100mb of system memory. If check the size of the dict getsizeof see sample of output. When python is up to 3GB of system memory getsizeofdict is only using 6424 bytes of memory.

Negative 5579 pI am currently trying to build a Resource DLL on on Windows Server 2003 and 2008. I am currently working with the Resource DLL code samples supplied with the Windows SDKs, and I cant get them to work.p  pOn Windows Server 2008 I succeeded compiling the Windows 7 SDK ClipBook Server sample, but couldnt get it to properly work in the cluster. When I insert the resource as a resource type to the cluster using cluster restype  create dll it works, but the resource is listed with an unknown type instead of a ClipBook Server type, as I think it should have as it is the type defined in the Resource DLLs code. I also succeed in creating a resource of that type, but I can never get it to go Online. I always get the errorp  pstrongSystem error 5079 has occurred 0x000013d7. The specified node does not support a resource of this type. This may be due to version inconsistencies or due to the absence of the resource DLL on this node.strongp  pAnd this is despite the fact that the resource is located on all the nodes in the cluster including the one I try to start the resource on.p  pOn Windows Server 2003, Im working with the Platform SDK version 5.2, and I cant even get the ClipBook Server Resource DLL code sample to compile. I always get strongMIDL1001 Error saying that it cannot open the file cluscfgserver.idlstrong. I added the path of the files location to the include path of the project. That didnt work. When I tried to hardcode the path of the file, I got several linker errors when trying to link with this file.p  pIf anyone knows anything about any of these problems, I would appreciate any input.p

Negative 5579 pI have a series of say boxes on the screen in a row, all subviews of my main view. Each is a UIView.

That method needs to be doing some work to tweak the position of these subviews during orientation changes. But I dont really understand the interplay of the animations with this method I would think it would get called eventually perhaps at the end, which would make sense and which should essentially be a noop after the animation. Can anyone explain the interaction to me It seems like Im close to enlightenment but not quite there yet.  Thanksp

Negative 5579 pI have implemented a Servlet hosted on Tomcat 6 server on Mandriva Linux. I have been able to make the client communicate with the Servlet. In response to a request the Servlet tries to instantiate a another class named KalmanFilter located in the same directory. The KalmanFilter tries to create four Matrices using Jama Matrix package.

Negative 5579 pIm beginning to work on the caching infrastructure for my ASP.NET MVC site. The problem is, I cant seem to find a reasonable place for data caching other than everywherep  pRight now my architecture looks like thisp  pController  Service Layer  Repository. The repository uses Linq to SQL for data access. p  pThe repository exposes generic methods like Insert, GetById, and GetQueryable, which returns an IQueryable that the service layer can further refine. p  pI like the idea of putting caching in the repository layer, since the service layer shouldnt really care where the data comes from. The problem though is with cache invalidation. The service layer has more information about when data becomes stale than the repository. For instancep  pSuppose we have a Users table and an Orders table the canonical example. The service layer offers methods like GetOrderint id, which  would call the repository layerp  precodepublic Order GetOrderint id      usingvar repo  repoFactory.CreateltOrdergt              return repo.GetByIdid       codepre  porp  precoderepo.GetQueryableorder gt order.Id  id ampamp order.HasShipped  false.Single codepre  pIf we cache in the repository layer, it seems like it would be very limited in knowing when that order data has changed. Suppose the user was deleted, causing all their orders to be deleted with a CASCADE. The service layer could invalidate the Orders cache, since it knew the user was just removed. The repository though since its a Unit of Work, wouldnt be aware. Ignore the fact that we shouldnt be querying orders for a deleted user, since its just an example. p  pTheres other situations where I think this shows itself. Suppose we want to fetch all the users ordersp  precoderepo.GetQueryableorder gt order.UserId  userId.ToList codepre  pThe repository can cache the results of this query, but, if another order is added, this query is no longer valid. Only the service layer is aware of this though. p  pIts also possible my understanding of the repository layer is wrong. I sort of view it as a facade around the data source i.e. changing from L2SQL to EF to whatever, the service layer is unaware of the underlying source. p

Negative 5579 pIn our database tables we keep a number of counting columns to help reduce the number of complex lookup queries. For example, in our users table we have columns for the number of reviews written, photos uploaded, friends, followers, etc. To help make sure these stay in sync we have a script that runs periodically to check and update these counting columns.p  pIve been attempting to write an efficient query that calculates the number of friends a specific user has and havent been able to figure out how to do it. In our friend model someone is a friend if they add you as a friend no confirmation needed, so you have to count the number of unique of people when adding the number of friends you have added plus the number of people who have added you as a friend.p  pHere are two queries that each work to update the friend count for all the rows in our users table for friendship in a single direction. What I cant figure out it how to combine them so you get the total number of unique friends a user hasp  h3Users Who Added You As A Friendh3  precodeUPDATE users    JOIN SELECT cid2, COUNT as c           FROM connections           JOIN users ON connections.cid1  users.userid         WHERE connectiontype  MM            AND connections.statusA            AND users.status  D      GROUP BY cid2 f ON f.cid2  users.userid     SET users.friends  f.c  WHERE users.status  D codepre  h3Users Who You Added As A Friendh3  precodeUPDATE users u    JOIN SELECT cid1, COUNT as c           FROM connections            JOIN users ON connections.cid1  users.userid           WHERE connectiontype  MM             AND connections.status  A             AND users.status  D        GROUP BY cid1 f ON f.cid1  users.userid     SET users.friends  f.c  WHERE users.status  D codepre
Negative 5579 h2What I want to doh2  pI have a computationally intensive OCaml application and Id like it to run in the background without disturbing normal computer usage. Id like to present the users with two optionsp  p1 the application only runs when CPU usage is virtually 0p  p2 the application only uses free processing power e.g. if other processes add up to 100, the OCaml application pauses if other processes are virtually 0, then there are no restrictions for the OCaml application if other processes add up to, say, 50 then OCaml will use up to 50.p  h2Some thoughtsh2  pMy idea is to check CPU usage at various check points in the code and pause execution if necessary.p  pIn 1, we just check if CPU is below say 2 and, if not, pause until it becomes lower than 2 again.p  pIn 2, things are trickier. Since when no restrictions are present the application always consumes 100 of CPU and checkpoints will be quite frequent, to reduce CPU usage to, say, half, I just have to delay it at every checkpoint by exactly the time it took between check points. If check points are frequent, this would be similar to using 50 CPU, Id say. For other percentages we can do something similar by suspending for appropriate periods of time. However, this looks very contrived, full of overhead, and above all, Im not sure it really does what I want. A better alternative could be to invoke codeUnix.nice ncode with some appropriate integer at the start of the application. I suppose that setting coden15code would probably be right.p  h2My questionsh2  pQ1 How can I know from within my OCaml application what the CPU usage for the application process is Id like to do this with an OCaml function and not by invoking ps or something similar on the command line...p  pQ2 Do you see problems with my idea to achieve 2. Which are the practical differences to changing niceness of processp  pQ3 Do you have any other suggestions for 2p

What can happen is that, if I get the object by the id and update the length, then it will work. If I get it by the type and update the length, then it wont work. So what Ive been doing so far to avoid the problem is to fetch the object the method that does not cause a problem later, but this is becoming more and more annoying to try and find a way that works.p  pAlso, now I have this exception when trying to create an object but not all of them, just on one specific table, and cant find a way for a workaround.

Negative 5579 pI really hope someone has some insight into this. Just to clarify what Im talking about up front when referring to Schema I mean the database object used for ownership separation, not the database create schema.p  pWe use Sql Server Schema objects to group tables into wholes where each group belongs to an application. Each application also has its own database login. Ive just started introducing database roles in order to fully automate deployment to test and staging environment. Were using xSQL Object compare engine. A batch file is run each night to perform comparison and generate a script change file. This can then be applied to the target database along with code changes.p  pThe issue Im encountering is as folows. Consider the following database structurep  pDatabasep  ul liSecuritySchemas ul liCore ul liCoreRole ownerli liSchemaARole select, delete, updateli liSchemaBRole selectli ulli liSchemaA ul liSchemaARole ownerli ulli liSchemaB ul liSchemaBRole ownerli ulli ulli liSecurityRolesDatabase Roles ul liCoreRole ul licoreloginli ulli liSchemaARole ul liloginali ulli liSchemaBRole ul liloginbli ulli ulli ul  pThe setup works perfectly well for the three applications that use these. The only problem is how to create  generate a script that creates schema  role permissions The owner role gets applied correctly. So for example, schema Core gets owner role CoreRole as expected. However the SchemaARole and SchemaBRole do not get applied.p  pI wasnt able to find an option to turn this on within xSQL object nor does an option to script this from SQL Server management studio exist. Well, I cant find it at least.p  pAm I trying to do impossible How does SQL Server manage this relationship thenp

However, there might be some function  havent heard about that attempts to connect to a DB in different ways.p  pAny thoughts would be great.  I have a PHP application that connects to a MySQL database on my machine but due to company policy, they only offer Oracle DBs so Im going to have to change things.p  pThank you.p

Negative 5579 pIm having difficulties understanding about the OpenGL perspective view. Ive read tons of information however it didnt help me trying to achieve what Im after. Which is making sure my 3d scene is filling the entire screen on every Android device.p  pTo test this, I will be drawing a quad in 3d space which in the end should touch every corner, filling up the whole devices screen. I could then use this quad, or actually its coordinates to specify a bounding box at a certain Z distance which I could use to put my geometry and making sure those fill up my screen. When the screen resizes, or I am to run it on another screen resolution, I would recalculate this bounding box and geometry. Im not talking about static geometry, but for instance say I want to fill the screen with balls and it doesnt matter how big or how many balls there are, the only important thing is the screen is filled and there are no redundant balls outside the visible frustum.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVZIRm.jpg altenter image description herep  ul liAs far as I understand when specifying the viewport you actually bind pixel values to the frustums boundaries. I know that you can actually set an orthographic view in a way your window pixels match 3d geometry position but Im not sure how this works in perspective view.li liHere Im assuming the viewport width and height to be mapped to the nearZ. So when a ball is at Z1f it has its original sizeli liWhen moving the ball into the screen so into the direction of farZ, the ball would be scaled down in order for the perspective to work. So a ball at Z51f for instance, would appear smaller on my screen and I would need more balls to fill up the entire screen.li liNow in order to do so, Im looking for the purple boundariesli liActually I need these boundaries to fill the entire screen on different frustum sizes width x height while the frustum angle and Z distance for the balls is always the sameli liI guess I could use trig to calculate these purple boundaries see blue triangle noteli liAm I correctly marking the frustum angle, it being the vertical angle of the frustumli liCould someone elaborate on the green 1f and 1f values as I seem to have read something about it Seems like some scalar that is used to resize the geometry within the frustumli ul  pI actually want to be able to programmaticaly position geometry against the viewport borders within 3d space at any resolutionwindow for any arbitrary Android device.p  pNote I have a flash background which uses a stage visual area with a known width x height at any resolution which makes it easy to positionscale assets either using absolute measurements or percentual measurements. I guess Im trying to figure out how this system applies to OpenGLs perspective view.p

Negative 5579 pI am using the telerik MVC template and have a database that has a huge number of columns and the telerik grid does not have a horizontal scroll bar, so I created checkboxes for the user to select exactly what columns they want to view.  It works well enough in that when I first go to the page it shows the checkboxes at top with the Apply button and the grid view underneath.  Because nothing has been submitted from the WebForm, the grid view shows all the columns.  Before adding the cookies, the user only had to press apply once for only those columns to appear.  However, if the user then tried to sort or filter one of these columns, it would revert back to showing all of the columns.  So, I created a cookie to store the selected information.  Unfortunately, this only helped with the selection of the first filter.  If a second filter is used, it would, again, show all of the columns instead of just the ones selected.  Furthermore, the user now has to press apply twice for their selections to show properly on the grid view.

Negative 5579 h2Questionh2  pCan anyone recommend a library for Ocaml that offers an emactorbased concurrency modelem for emdistributed computingemp  pNote here the actorbased and distributed  Id like the actorbased model, but also I want seamless handling of distributed actors  I dont want to write the protocol to talk to them. The library should ideally also offer standard patterns such a supervisor trees and so on.p  hr  h2Motivationh2  pI love Erlang concurrency model and ability to transparently deal with distributed processes and local processes together. However, I find Erlangs syntax to be rather limiting and would like a much more expressive language. Im considering moving from Erlang to either Scala or Ocaml.p  pI know Scala has the Akka library which seems to offer a nice Scala version of Erlangs concurrency model. Id like to see what is available on the Ocaml side.p  hr  h2Asideh2  pId also be happy to hear about actorbased concurrency libraries for other languages particularly C, Haskell, Python and Ruby.p

Negative 5579 pEDITED TO BETTER DESCRIBE THE SCENARIOp  pI have a MySQL database containing 2 tables, technicians and workorders. The technicians table has columns techID, techsurname, techfirstname and techuserlogin. The workorders table has columnsjobID PK, wtechID, wtechsurname, wtechfirstname and wtechuserlogin among other things.p  pI have a page with a repeat region listing submitted work orders, the date of the work order is a link that passes the jobID in a URL to a page containing an update form. The form is populated with data taken from the workorders table particular the the jobID customer name, address, equip to repair, problem, etc.. On the form is a dropdown populated from the technicians table. This dropdown lists the techuserlogin of the technicians. I have included hidden fields to the form page, wtechuserlogin and wtechID.  When I view the source of the page it shows the values from the workorders table, but I dont know how to work it into the query to accomplish the desired results.p  pWhen the form posts it updates the workorders table. All of this is working. What I am hoping to accomplish is to have the wtechuserlogin from the workorders table for the particular work order become the default value of the dropdown menu if a technician has already been selected. If no selection has previously been made from the dropdown menu I would like the default of the dropdown to be Select Technician. Ive tried a few things but nothing works so far.p  pHere is the code for the dropdownp  precodeltselect nametechuserlogin idtechuserlogingt               ltphp         sqlSELECT techID, techuserlogin FROM technicians resultmysqlquerysql  options  while rowmysqlfetcharrayresult       techIDrow[techID]     techuserloginrow[techuserlogin]     options.ltoption valuetechuserlogingttechuserloginltoptiongt   ifemptytechuserlogin  die You must select a Technician   gt               ltoption valueltphp echo options gt selectedselectedgtltphp echo options gt           ltselectgt codepre  pCan anyone help me with this problem Any assistance will be appreciated.

Negative 5579 pIm wondering if there is a common pattern for the following scenario.p  pLets say I have one JSF page backed with one request scoped bean. I want to fech all data rows from a database table when a user enters this page. The same JSF page contains a form to provide query criteria. When the user provides query criteria and submits the form, I want to display the result on the same page, too.p  pThe suitable place to fetch all rows at page entry is the PostConstruct method. This is a nice place to do that since additional injected request parameters are already available here and can be used in the query. However, parameters submited from the form are not available yet. They can be accessed in the action method.p  pIf the user queries the database table using the form criteria the database will be queried twice in this case. The request scoped bean will be recreated and PostConstruct method fetching all rows will be called prior to the form action method fetching what the user wants.p  pOf course I could redirect the form result to another JSF page backed by a different bean with DB query only in the action method. But is there a way to accomplish fetching only what is needed with one JSF page and one managed beanp

Negative 5579 pI need to make asynchronous HTTP call to my server in order to receive XML response. After I get the response I will call a [previously specified] function if it is success or some other function if its an error.p  pSo what I thought about in the first place was coroutines. Unfortunately, after I make the http.get call I cannot yield, as it will wait for the whole thing to finish. I know I can use separate functions to read the response, however I have to wait at least for the first bytes of data in order for this function to be triggered which would allow me to yield. Anyway, for what I wan to do using coroutines doesnt look like the way to go.p  pThen Ive tried calling a C function from lua, creating separate thread to get the XML and then call a function in Lua, however this doesnt work because of luastate changing after a new thread is created. Before the thread is created I can see 3 parameters on the stack, and after creation of the new thread [I am passing luaState as the argument] it has only one. Anyway, from what I understand luaState will be closed once the original cfunction call is finished, so I wont be able to call back.p  pSince Im just starting with lua and Im even less familiar with lua to c bindings I can only hope Im making some stupid mistakes and it will be easy to solve. For now however Im stuck with no idea on how to progress further.p  pThe story behind this issue Im porting my game from Cocos2D objective C framework to Cocos2dX C framework. I want to use Lua bindings as I think I will fail to port it to C. Anyway I want to do it in Lua.  So Ive got a scene where someone accesses a list of inventory they have in the game. If the response is immediate they will basically see a window opened with list of inventory. However, if it takes a tad bit longer to get the data [connection issues, sever overload... whatever] screen will fade out and some animation indicating data transfer will be shown on screen. At least this is how it works on the objc version of the game and I want the same thing.p  pIs there something I have missed during my research, is it possible to do itp  pBTW I have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5795419luasocketasynchronouscallsLua socket asynchronous callsa and it doesnt help me because it still waits for the beginning of the transfer before it will start another one.p

Negative 5579 pI am trying to set up caching correctly and have set Expires headers to 365 days in the future which is working correctly but not showing correctly in IE9. Does anyone know whyp  pWhen you visit any website in IE9 eg www.google.com then click Enter in the address bar to revisit it with full caching it shows a lot of extra 304s which Fiddler does not show.p  pLooking in the network inspector tab on F12, IE9 shows that it has received 304 Not Modified responses for CSS and JS files and 3 images possibly images with modified dates within approx past month  the other 30 images not shown are older.p  pHowever, according to Fiddler and looking at IIS logs on the server on the website I am developing, it has not actually made these requests. The IE9 network timeline shows these grey 302s as no wait time and lt1 ms response time  whereas if I hit F5 they are also grey 302s but shown as several milliseconds waiting and downloading time and they hit the network. p  pSo why does IE9 network inspector think it issued a conditional request for these Did it actually issue a request that was satisfied within the network stack somewhere, before it got to Fiddler p  pChrome shows all requests, including all images, as grey 200 from cache apart from the page itself which is a black 200 which is correct according to Fiddler and IIS logs. p  pFirebug shows grey 200 OK for CSS and JS and oddly just one image also correct assuming grey 200 means from cache  but why show only these resources and not all the other imagesp  pIve been reading Eric Lawrences blog posts about IE9 caching and network stack but he doesnt mention this odd behaviour.p

Switching the define value causes the segfault to appear or not, depending on if the volatile instance of the struct is used or not.p  precodetypedef struct      volatile int foo     volatile int bar  TestStruct  const TestStruct constStruct   1, 2 volatile const TestStruct volatileConstStruct   3, 4  define SEGFAULT 0  int mainvoid      TestStruct  constPtr  constcastltTestStructgtampconstStruct     TestStruct  constVolPtr  constcastltTestStructgtampvolatileConstStruct      ifSEGFAULT  0         constVolPtrgtfoo  10     else         constPtrgtfoo  20     endif  codepre  pCan anyone help me understand why the volatile keyword presents a workaround for the segfault Also, can anyone suggest a method to allow me to modify the values in the structure for unit test without adding the volatile keyword to all the structure instancesp  pstrongEDITstrong p  pIve just discovered that you can do this in Cp  precodedefine const codepre  pIncluding the effective const undefine above in the test fixture allows my target compiler to see the const keyword and correctly place the structures into flash memory. However, the preprocessor on the UnitTest compiler strips out the const keyword, so my test fixture is able to modify the struct.p  pThe drawback to this solution is that I cannot add unit tests that verify correct const operation of function calls. However, since removing the const from the struct instances is not an option need the data to be placed in flash this appears to be a drawback I will have to live with.p
Negative 5579 pI know this can be implemented fairly easily but I must use a standard functionality for this.

Negative 5579 ol lipWhen a C program is compiled and the object fileELF is created. the object file contains different sections such as bss, data, text and other segments. I understood that these sections of the ELF are part of virtual memory address space. Am I right Please correct me if I am wrong.pli lipAlso, there will be a virtual memory and page table associated with the compiled program. Page table associates the virtual memory address present in ELF to the real physical memory address when loading the program. Is my understanding correctpli lipI read that in the created ELF file, bss sections just keeps the reference of the uninitialised global variables. Here uninitialised global variable means, the variables that are not intialised during declarationpli lipAlso, I read that the local variables will be allocated space at run time i.e., in stack. Then how they will be referenced in the object filepli lipIf in the program, there is particular section of code available to allocate memory dynamically. How these variables will be referenced in object filepli ol  pI am confused that these different segments of object file like text, rodata, data, bss, stack and heap are part of the physical memory RAM, where all the programs are executed. But I feel that my understanding is wrong. How are these different segments related to the physical memory when a process or a program is in executionp

Negative 5579 pOK so Searching is my weak area in Java and could really use help as to where to begin on this Assignment The data member n is no longer needed. The LinkedList should be created and assigned to theList in the constructor rather than in run. makeScanner, getPerson, and main should not be modified. The Person and FileFormatException classes should also not be modified. display will no longer compile since theList is no longer an array.

Considerp  precode  theList.addp codepre  pThe variables index and n are no longer necessary. Modify search to perform the linear search on a list rather than an array.

Negative 5579 pIve googled a bit about this subject and everyone seems to believe on other webpages that to do such thing as copying the contents from the Backbuffer to the Frontbuffer, strongwithout calling SwapBuffersstrong, is not possible. p  pTheres some kind of workarround as creating an auxiliar extra buffer like pBuffer, render to it and copy the contents into a texture and then display the texture.p  pBut Im wondering if there is really no chance to Render on the Backbuffer of Opengl, and copy contents to the frontbuffer. I want to achieve this because between 2 calls of SwapBuffers, many of my rendered scene remains the same, and only a small portion rectangle of it has been changed, so I would like to avoid RENDERING the other 90 of the scene unnecessarily everytime.p  pPixel Buffer Objects seem to help us copying pixels from FrameBuffer to a Pixel Buffer Object, using Direct Memory Acess.

Looking further into my own exception I find thisp  precode    return gen.next     yield historian      if p         p[0].stdout.close         p[0].terminate     lt This line highlighted as the problem         p[0].wait  def lastchangeself, sha, path, historianNone     if historian is not None         return historianpath codepre  pNow I am not sure but I read that this is something to do with how windows processes codep[0].terminatecode that causes the error and it was suggested that the exception was ignored by changing it to thisp  precodetry     p[0].terminate except WindowsError     pass codepre  pWeather or not this will work, I dont know. But what Im wondering is  where on earth is this strongemPyGIT.pyemstrong file All I have to go by is the pathp  precodebuildbdist.win32eggtracextgitPyGIT.py codepre  pAm I right in thinking this isnt part of a compiled file or something I installed the plugin that runs the code as a .eggp  pIf anyone could give me a hand, all I want to do it see if I can modify the filep  pThanksp

Negative 5579 pIm looking at creating a heatmap of numerical data spread over various locations within a building. Ive spent a few hours researching data mapping, etc. and am looking for some advice. I am new to GIS. The majority of options available are mostly tile APIs that use latlong, and are overkill for my requirements...p  pUltimately, I just want to output a background image a floor plan with the heatmap overlay demonstrating areas of high intensity. The data is bound to specific locations example, activity level 14, location reception entrance and so is not randomly distributed over the map. Data has timestamps, and the final objective is to print PNGs of hourly activity for animation.p  pI feel like I have two options.p  pI like this tutorial httpdylanvester.compostCreatingHeatMapswithNET2028CSharp29.aspx as it offers a huge amount of flexibility and the final imagery is very similar to what I would like  its a great head start. That said, Id need to assign locations such as reception entrance to an x,y coordinate, or even a number of x,y coordinates. Id then need to process a matrix prior to every heatmap, taking data from my CSV files and placing activity values in the appropriate coordinates.p  pThe other option I think I have is to create a custom shapefile  from the floor plan. That is, create a vector graphic with defined regions, where each is attributable to a taggable location. This seems the most flexible option, but Im really, really struggling to find out how to create shapefilesp  pMy unfamiliarity with GIS terminology is making searches difficult. The latter seems the most sensible solution use the shapefile with something like a hrefhttpsgist.github.com1370472 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com1370472a to change the activity values over time.p  pLinks found p  ul liguthcad.comcad2shape.htm but dont have CAD drawing, just raster floorplanli listackoverflow.comquestions4014072arcgisflexoverlayfloorplanpng unhelpful, dont want tiledli lioliverobrien.co.uk201001simplechoroplethmapsinquantumgisli ligis.stackexchange.comquestions20901usinggisforinteractivefloorplan looks greatli ul  pTo summarise Id like to map data bound to locations within a building. Theres very good code in a C tutorial Id like to use, but the linking of activity data to coordinates is potentially messy although could allow for describing transitions of activity between locations as vectors between coordinates could be used....

Negative 5579 pLets say I have a user control called Graph in a window. This user control contains a grid, within which there is another user control, called Toolbar. Now Graph exposes a public property called Mode, which uses a dependency property called ModeProperty as a backing store. I want an element in the Toolbar user control to bind to the Mode property in its ancestor Graph. How can I do this Even just getting a reference to Graph is proving to be harder than I expected, this.parent gets a reference to the grid rather than the Graph.p

Negative 5579 pI have a stream of partially binary data, and I want to match when a certain bit is set in a byte in a certain position in the string.p  pThis is an existing system in .NET using codeSystem.Text.RegularExpressionscode which is configured with a number of patterns  when certain patterns are matched, the match triggers an action.p  pIm interfacing to a device where one of the indicators is only available within a bitfield.p  pThe only alternative I can see is to match a whole equivalence class of all the bytes which have that bit set.p  pThis is a MettlerToledo scale interface.p  pThe stream looks like thisp  precodeSTX SWA SWB SWC WEIGHT 6 bytes ASCII TARE 6 bytes ASCII 0x0D CR Optional checksum codepre  pWhere codeSWAcode, codeSWBcode, codeSWCcode are status word bytes and Im interested in bit 3 of codeSWBcode.p  pThey always set bit 5 to 1 in all these status words so that it is a space code0x20code when no bits are set.  So in practice with no other status bits coming through, codeSWBcode alternates between codecode code0x50code  code01010000code and SPACE code0x20code  code00100000code  In actuality, the scale is also likely to send bits 0 and 4 in other states which I dont care about.p  pSo I could match code..[all other equivalent characters]..6.6r0codep

I need to repeat these operations some number of times, and subsequent repetitions must work on a fresh copy of the graph.

Negative 5579 pI declared a nonfinal static codeSharedPreferencescode object called codePREFScode together with the other constants in my codeConstants.javacode classp  precodepublic static SharedPreferences PREFS  null codepre  pMy reason for doing so is that my app is comprised of about 6 different codeAsyncTaskscode that keep accessing the same shared prefs file, and I didnt want to get the codeSharedPreferencescode and its codeEditorcode every time. On my apps first run, I make a call to codegetSharedPreferencescode in my codeMainActivitycode and store it to codePREFScode so that it points to an instance before the codeAsyncTaskcodes are fired, and therefore avoid a codeNullPointerExceptioncode.p  pHowever, I kept getting codeNullPointerExceptioncodes from the codeAsyncTaskcodes anyway. All stack traces point to the line where I make a call to codeConstants.PREFScode to get a value. My theory is that after some time, Android kills my apps process, so the next time the alarm for any of my codeAsyncTaskcodes goes off, the value of codeConstants.PREFScode would already be codenullcode.p  pMy question is Should I make a static variable for codeContextcode instead Will its state be persisted even when Android kills off my process I always pass a reference of codeContextcode to my codeAsyncTaskcodes when the latter are instantiated so they can call on codegetSystemServicecode, and that never throws a codeNullPointerExceptioncode. However, I dont see codeContextcode extending codeSerializablecode from the Android docs.p

So the connect threw an IOEx and not a NPE, so the socket still was there. Inside the catch block the socket.close then threw a NPE crashing the Service because i didnt use a NPE catch there.p  pImho it just doesnt make sense to put a NPE catch block inside another catch block that requires the object to be alive in the first place.p  pThis all is happening more and more with android 4 and most of the time when the service and the app is running in the background for some time. Its not a market app, so its ok if its still active after hitting the home button. But once its in the background for too long, the unconnected socket is being gced it seems.p  pQuestion is why is this happening  and should i really put a NPE catch in addition to the inner IOEx p

Negative 5579 pIm writing a blog in Google App Engine using Python and Jinja2. I have a GQL Table for my blogposts and one for all the comments. Each record in the common table has a blogpostid column so that I know which blogpost they are linked to. I use the query SELECT  from BLOGPOSTS and pass this to my render function. Then in my HTML Template there is a forloop that prints out all my blogposts. This goes pretty smooth. In the permalink of a blogpost, its easy to print the comments because I know the blogpostid so I can just query the comments table against it and print them out.p  pWhereas, On the front page I want to display the first two comments of every blogpost right below it. but I am not able to come up with a solution for printing out comments below the blogposts on my frontpage because I dont know how to pass the comments of a particular blogpost to my render function. Is there a solution for this  p

It seems the nowPlayingItem setter calling indexOfObject on itemCollection.  Workaroundsp  pstrongFollowupstrongp  pIt seems there is no way to select an index in the queue of an MPMediaPlayer, and strongsetNowPlayingItemstrong calls strongindexOfObjectstrong To find a selected media item.  The result is that strongindexOfNowPlayingItemstrong will return the index of the first instance identical to nowPlayingItem in the queue.  In my case, this affects the visual representation of the queue that I have in my app its a scrollview with a panel for each song.  Its possible that MPMediaItemCollection was not intended for use with playlists where MPMediaItems can occur more than once.

Obviously Id love to have it look this way from the start.p  pHeres my code in viewDidLoadp  precodeNSURL url  [NSURL fileURLWithPath[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourcemovie ofTypem4v]] moviePlayer  [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURLurl] [moviePlayer prepareToPlay] CGRect screenBounds  [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds [moviePlayer.view setFrameCGRectMake0, 0, screenBounds.size.height, screenBounds.size.width] [self.view addSubviewmoviePlayer.view] moviePlayer.controlStyle  MPMovieControlStyleFullscreen [moviePlayer play] [super viewDidLoad] codepre  pThe app is set to only show in landscape mode, so the rotation takes effect every 180 degrees instead of 90. BTW the moviePlayer var is set in the .h file like sop  precodeproperty nonatomic, strong MPMoviePlayerController moviePlayer codepre  pThen its synthesized in my ViewControllerp  precodesynthesize moviePlayer codepre  pSo does anyone have any ideas I tried changing setFrame to start at 0,20 instead of 0,0 but that messed things up on the later rotations. If theres a way to ignore the dumb status bar on initial load, Id love to know it. Thanks.p

Negative 5579 pI am working on a system where I need a whiletrue where the loop constantly listens to a queue and increments counts in memory.p  pThe data is constantly coming in the queue, so I cannot avoid a whiletrue condition.

Negative 5579 pI have a webpage where HTML within a certain codeDIVcode called codecontentcode is converted to PDF. The codecontentcode div can have more divs within it, each containing text, and absolutely positioned. Each of these codedivscode is called a textboxp  pThe problem is that the PDF turns out not strongexactlystrong like the HTML within codecontentcode. Sometimes text gets wrapped onto two lines in the PDF, although it wasnt that way in the HTML. This happens when the following is truep  ul liA codetextboxcode containing text appears to be fine in the current view, but if the user were to zoom in using Ctrl, then the text wraps to the next line within its div.li ul  pSo what I need to do is somehow detect that emif the HTML were zoomed in, there would be a textwrapem, and if so, then expand the width of the element a tad so that the PDF doesnt end up wrapping onto a new line.p  pIs there any way to detect that Or anything else that comes to the same effectp

Negative 5579 pI dont know if its a bug or if there is an option somewhere, but all my c source code files from the jni folder are included in my apk file. Not a good idea.

Negative 5579 pI am trying to compile a plain and simple Android Application WITHOUT native code using the new nsight plugin with visual studio. The problem is visual studio wont even try to compile as it doesnt see anything to compile. Running ant debug manually compiles it fine. The Android application with native code works fine, as visual studio recognizes the c file as something to compile. Does anyone know how to fix this, because as is, the Android Application without Native code option is rather useless.p  pThe output isp  precode1gt Build started Project Android3, Configuration Debug Android   Build 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 uptodate, 0 skipped  codepre  pI should also note if I go into command line, and run ant build, it builds fine.p
Negative 5579 pIn my VS 2012 WPF project, I have a customized textbox class called codeTextBoxDXcode that adds an codeAutoSelectcode feature.  No problem.  I have another class based on codeTextBoxDXcode called IntBox which only allows integers.  Thats where our story begins.  Both classes are used in binding situations like sop  precodeltlocalTextBoxDX Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 xNametxtBoxsinglesName Width320 HorizontalAlignmentleft TextBinding SelectedItem.name, ElementNamelistBoxSingles, ModeOneWaygt ltlocalIntBox xNameintBoxheightin Width60 AllowZeroValueTrue MaxLength2 TextBinding SelectedItem.heightin, ElementNamelistBoxSingles, ModeOneWay MinVal0 MaxVal11gt codepre  pPretty sure most of that is irrelevant except for the binding.  Both work fine in that they change their text corresponding to codeListBoxcode selections.  But in the codeIntBoxcode class, I had to add code for allowing only integers.  In order to do that, I tapped into the codeTextChangedcode event in my codeIntBoxcode class.  The end result is thisp  precodeusing System using System.Text.RegularExpressions using System.Windows using System.Windows.Controls using System.Windows.Input   namespace Herculese  public class IntBox  TextBoxDX      INIT PROPERTIES     private int MaxVal  0     private int MinVal  0     private bool AllowZeroValue  false      INIT STRING TO KEEP TRACK OF TEXT BEFORE CHANGES     private string originalText      public IntBox              ADD TO TEXTCHANGED HANDLER         TextChanged  new TextChangedEventHandlerMyOnTextChanged          STORE ORIGINAL TEXT         originalText  this.Text           EVENT HANDLER WHEN TEXT IS CHANGED      private void MyOnTextChangedobject sender, EventArgs e              IF THERE IS TEXT IN THE BOX,         MessageBox.Showyee         if this.Text.Length gt 0                      REMOVE SPACES AND LEADING ZEROS FROM STRING             if AllowZeroValue                 this.Text  this.Text.TrimStart0             this.Text  Regex.Replacethis.Text, s,               IF VALUE ISNT NUMERICAL OR NOTHING IS LEFT AFTER REMOVING ZEROS AND SPACES, CHANGE TEXT BACK TO ORIGINAL             Regex regex  new Regex[09]             if regex.IsMatchthis.Text  this.Text.Length lt 1                              this.Text  originalText                 System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Play                          IF VALUE IS NUMERICAL,             else                              MAKE SURE VALUE IS WITHIN ACCEPTED RANGE.

Wild parties, you name it.  Suddenly I realized that binding for codeIntBoxcode wasnt working anymore.  I could manually change the text just fine.  It only accepted integers and worked like a charm.  But changing the codeListBoxcode selection no longer updated the text.  If I removed the code in codeMyOnTextChangedcode, the binding worked again.  I figured my code was causing the problem.  So I came back today with a fresh head and realized something weird.p  pIf I remove the code in codeMyOnTextChangedcode and replace it with a codeMessageBoxcode, the binding works and the message box appears.  Makes perfect sense and furthers the idea that my code is causing the issue.  Now for the weirdness  if I put the code back into the event after the codeMessageBoxcode code, binding is broken again and the codeMessageBoxcode never shows meaning the event never fires. All I can say to that is... HUUUUH  Ive recreated this several times just to be sure Im not crazy. The only other thing I could think of is a conflict with the codeTextBoxDXcode that it inherits from so I made it inherit directly from codeTextBoxcode and got the same results... Anybody got a clue on this onep

Negative 5579 pI have a small question regarding scoping when i use a custom callback function passed to jQuery.animate. Consider the code below.p  precodevar WebApi  function projectInit WebApi, , Modernizr, window, document, undefined       element.onclick.skiptodocumentpart, function skipToDocumentPart e          WebApi.scrollTo             this.getAttributehref.offset.top,              1000,                  pageNav.length  repositionPageNavpageNav, this  null                  return false           function repositionPageNav pageNav, elm          console.logthis  undefined           WebApi.scrollTo  function yPos, iSpeed, callback          html,body.animate              scrollTop  yPos          ,              duration  typeof iSpeed  number  iSpeed  1000,              complete  typeof callback  function  callback  null        return WebApi  WebApi  , jQuery, Modernizr, this, this.document codepre  pWhen i log the function context in the repositionPageNav callback i get a undefined, ideally i would have the context reference the element clicked on, as jQuery itself ussualy do. I could do this by changing the callback call to WebApi.scrollTo as followsp  precodeWebApi.scrollTo         yPos,          1000,          aspageNav.length  function scope                  return repositionPageNav.callscope, pageNav             this  null          codepre  pBy creating the closure the context inside the callback now refers to the element clicked as i intended but does this hurt performance And 1 thing i cannot get my head around is why in the first example the context is undefined Is it because i dont call the callback as callback.callcontext Any suggestionsideasp  pMany Thanks,p  pNick.p

Ill likely be serializingdeserializing JSON data as a means of allowing iOS users to easily export and reimport their data. This could be a case of backing up and restoring on the same device, or importing the data onto an entirely new device.p  pMy main question at this point is how I handle the identification of existing data during import. If Im reimporting objects that already exist in the store Id ideally like to update them. Likewise, Id like to leave any existing data thats not included in the import alone. Whats the best practice in this situation Should I assign each NSManagedObject a unique ID as and when its created and compare this ID when determining whether an object is equalp  pIm aware that each NSManagedObject has an objectID assigned to it, but Im not entirely sure I can rely on this given that exported data could be imported onto an entirely separate device where objectIDs could well collide or, more likely, the object would be assigned a new objectID upon creation.p

Negative 5579 pWe use a desktop software to localize our .NET application. It can export the localizable strings to XLS, that I send to our users who help us to translate the program strings.p  pAll is OK if only one user is involved into the translation process with a certain language. But if two users start to localize the program to the same language  we face with translation collisions.p  pI thought to start using SVN to host our translation XLS files, but maybe someone could recommend me an inexpensive online service that allows us to avoid using SVN cause it requires some learning curve for our customers.p

Negative 5579 pHere is my problem I am trying to use a web tshirt designer that uses an online tshirt site API. The issue should have nothing to do with the application but it helps me describing the system.

I uploaded the proxy and the html with the script on a webserver and everything works as it should.p  pUnfortunately, I need to load the html from a different domain.

Once you strip out .Net and 3rd party library calls there is not much left...So is it a case that the amount of work to make it testable means its not a good candidate to testp  pA lot of the methods in this project are private, as this project happens to be a windows service. Ive read you should only really test methods which are externally visible public or exposed through an interface, it is unlikely in this case however that i want to expose any of my own methods. So is this project worth testing as id probably need to either change method access modifiers to public or add some attributes so that NUnit can see themp  pCheersp

I could solve it partly by putting a for loop at the end of each iteration, but I still lose the interaction capabilities of the separate figures.p  pFind the code below, thanks in advance.p  pCheers, Michaelp  precodevar color  d3.scale.category20  var force  new Array var div  new Array var svg  new Array var graph  new Array var link var node var width  360 var height  360 var brush  new Array var shiftKey var count  0  loop through the different subsystems in the jsonfile fornamesubsystem in graphs      add a div for each subsystem     div[count]  document.createElementdiv     div[count].style.width  360px     div[count].style.height  360px     div[count].style.cssFloatleft     div[count].id  namesubsystem      document.body.appendChilddiv[count]       force is called. all attributes with default values are noted. see API reference on github.     force[count]  d3.layout.force         .size[width, height]         .linkDistance20         .linkStrength1         .friction0.9         .charge30         .theta0.8         .gravity0.1      div[count].appendChilddocument.createTextNodenamesubsystem      create the svg rectangle in which other elements can be visualised     svg[count]  d3.selectnamesubsystem         .onkeydown.brush, keydown         .onkeyup.brush, keyup       .appendsvg         .attrwidth, width         .attrheight, height         .attrid,namesubsystem      brush[count]  svg[count].appendg         .datumfunction  return selected false, previouslySelected false          .attrclass, brush      force is started     force[count]         .nodesgraphs[namesubsystem].nodes         .linksgraphs[namesubsystem].links         .start      link elements are called, joined with the data, and links are created for each link object in links     link  svg[count].selectAll.link         .datagraphs[namesubsystem].links         .enter.appendline         .attrclass, link         .stylestrokewidth, functiond  return Math.sqrtd.thickness          .stylestroke, functiond             if d.linktype  reactant                 return black              else                  return red                            node elements are called, joined with the data, and circles are created for each node object in nodes     node  svg[count].selectAll.node         .datagraphs[namesubsystem].nodes         .enter.appendcircle         .attrclass, node         radius         .attrr, 5         fill         .attrfill, functiond              if d.type  metabolite                  return blue              else                  return red                               .onmousedown, functiond              if d.selected   Dont deselect on shiftdrag.                 if shiftKey node.classedselected, functionp  return p.selected  d  p              else d3.selectthis.classedselected, d.selected  true                               .onmouseup, functiond              if d.selected ampamp shiftKey d3.selectthis.classedselected, d.selected  false                  .callforce[count].drag             .ondragstart,function dragstartd                 d.fixedtrue                 d3.selectthis.classedfixed,true                             gives titles to nodes. i do not know why this is separated from the first node calling.     node.appendtitle         .textfunctiond  return d.name       enable brushing of the network     brush[count].calld3.svg.brush         .xd3.scale.identity.domain[0, width]         .yd3.scale.identity.domain[0, height]         .onbrushstart, functiond              node.eachfunctiond  d.previouslySelected  shiftKey ampamp d.selected                   .onbrush, function              var extent  d3.event.target.extent             node.classedselected, functiond                  return d.selected  d.previouslySelected                  extent[0][0] lt d.x ampamp d.x lt extent[1][0]                 ampamp extent[0][1] lt d.y ampamp d.y lt extent[1][1]                               .onbrushend, function              d3.event.target.clear             d3.selectthis.calld3.event.target                    applies force per step or tick.      force[count].ontick, function          link.attrx1, functiond  return d.source.x              .attry1, functiond  return d.source.y              .attrx2, functiond  return d.target.x              .attry2, functiond  return d.target.y           node.attrcx, functiond  return d.x              .attrcy, functiond  return d.y           with this it works partly     for var i  0 i lt 5000 iforce[count].tick     count   function keydown    if d3.event.metaKey switch d3.event.keyCode      case 38 nudge 0, 1 break  UP     case 40 nudge 0, 1 break  DOWN     case 37 nudge1,  0 break  LEFT     case 39 nudge1,  0 break  RIGHT      shiftKey  d3.event.shiftKey  d3.event.metaKey   function keyup    shiftKey  d3.event.shiftKey  d3.event.metaKey  codepre  pedit updated the code after the comments, still the same problem.p

Negative 5579 pI have been using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comjames2mseedbank relnofollowseedbank gema to give my Rails seeds some structure i.e. environment specific seed folders, one seed file per model, order dependencies etc.p  pNow I came across the a hrefhttpsgithub.commbleighseedfu relnofollowseedfu gema which among other things makes it easy and expressive to say seed these records, and if one with that id exists, update the other fields. E.gp  precodeCategory.seedid,    id gt 1, name gt Food ,    id gt 2, name gt Drink   codepre  pI can achieve the same result with some cumbersome ActiveRecord calls in my seed files, but I would much rather use the nice syntax provided by seedfu. Additionally, I want to keep using the features seedbank gives me. Another rationale is that I may migrate only part of my seed files to the other syntax and that it makes no sense to use two rake commands side by side.p  pIf I just put the above code in my codedbseedscategories.seeds.rbcode file and run coderake dbseedcategoriescode i get the error codeundefined method seedcode. I guess I would somehow need to import the codeseedcode method from a hrefhttpsgithub.commbleighseedfublobmasterlibseedfuactiverecordextension.rb relnofollowcodeSeedFuActiveRecordExtensioncodea, but I dont know how.p  pIm on Rails 3.2.13 and using the newest version of seedfu straight from the github repo.p
Negative 5579 pWe have a big .NET project consisting of many modules, which are implemented as Visual Studio library projects and compiled into respective assemblies DLLs.p  pWe have a layered architecture and we manage dependencies between the modules  layers by setting references between the Visual Studio projects  assemblies. This allows us to separate APIsSPIs from the implementations, and keep distinct layers separated, thus effectively enforcing the constraints of our architecture.p  pHowever, simetimes we wish we could transitively reexport the types imported in one assembly to any further assembly which has a reference to the importing assembly.p  pFor example, suppose a type codeTcode is defined in assembly codeAcode, assembly codeBcode references codeAcode, and assembly codeCcode references codeBcode, like thisp  precodeA lt B lt C codepre  pWe would like to see the type codeTcode in assembly codeCcode, without explicitly setting the reference to codeAcode in the assembly codeCcode. We would like to somehow emreexportem the reference to codeAcode in codeBcode instead.p  pIs it possiblep  pP. S. Why do we want to do this Because some types are used throuout the application think of utilityhelper classes or common interfaces and it would be annoying to duplicate the references in every project which depends on these types. Furthermore, when we refactor our code and move these around, we get lots of error messages because of missing references.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo clarify, here is a simple diagram.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5sk6S.png altenter image description herep  pNot only does codeConsumer Bcode depend on codeBcode, but also on codeAcode, since codeBcode extends codeAcode. However, if codeAcode is defined in a different assembly than the assembly of codeBcode, then we also strongmuststrong add a reference to the assembly of codeAcode the same applies to providers. But there is no actual strongneedstrong to add this reference, since the dependency on codeAcode strongfollowsstrong from the fact that we depend on codeBcode and codeBcode extends codeAcode. What we really need is to somehow emreexportem the dependency of codeBcode on codeAcode.p  pHow can this scenario emerge Suppose there was only one interface codeBcode and you decided to extract common interface codeAcode from codeBcode and place it in a separate assembly such that some other modules can reuse the new interface without adding the dependency on the original interface. And there you go now youll have to add a reference to the new assembly everywhere codeBcode was used before.p

Negative 5579 pI am researching on how to resize the frameless widget in Qt 5.1. Due to crossplatform consideration, Windowsrelated codes will not be appropriate.p  pNow my method is when a user hovers mouse at the edge of the windowwidget,cursor shape changes to hint the window can be resized at that time. After clicking and then drag, a rubberband is being shown to demonstrate the rectangle area that the window would resize to. Once the user releases the mouse, rubberband disappears, and the window then resize to the desired size. Have I made it clearp  pSince Qt cant make drawing directly on the screen, as a makeshift, a full screenshotput in a QLabel is utilized to simulate the actual screen, and a rubberband can then be constructed in the fullscreen QLabel. It seems to the users that they are dragging the window in the real window screen.p  pMy problem is after the user clicked the main widget,though a fullscreen QLabel is shown, the rubberband refuses to appear. Instead, only after you release mouse first and then clickdrag again can the rubberband appear.p  pAlthough I have sent one MouseButtonRelease event to the main widget and a MouseMove event to the  label, it doesnt seem to work.

Negative 5579 pI have been reading about about Restful webservices being Stateless.

Negative 5579 pI need to update the position of a child window inside my System.Windows.Forms.MDIClient container when the user scrolls it by dragging the MDIClients scrollbar thumb. p  pHowever I cant find an event that triggers when this happens. p  pAm I simply missing it, or do I need a workaround, possibly by talking direct to the scrollbar p  pIve already tried handling MDIClient.Layout events, but they arent being triggered by scrolling.p  pEDIT I actually only need to know when the scrolling has stopped, in order to change my child windows position.p  pEDIT2 As a temporary workaround, Im resetting the child window position on a timer every second, obviously not ideal, but better than nothing. Looks terrible thoughp

Negative 5579 pWe have a 32bit C GUI application running on 32 bit windows 7. We are planning to migrate our server with C apps to 64bit linux.  We have noticed that long types are larger in 64 bit.

What is a good way to solve this incompatibility Do we need to change the code How or Do we use a third party software to do the conversion What software is itp
Negative 5579 pIve looked for this everywhere in vain.p  pI have a macro in one Excel file codeSplitTickets.xlsmcode that loops through 3 separate Excel files. When codeSplitTicketscode is opened a dialog appears with a button to launch the macro.p  pSince I dont want users to mess with the excel with accidental keys or clicks while the macro is running, I would like to keep the dialog on top of all the files being opened, modified and closed, and update the label displayed when the process is over.p  pI tried setting it up as codemodalcode but since the macro needs to select sheets, cells and ranges, the dialog being codemodalcode blocks the rest of the macro being executed. And turning codemodalcode off makes it disappear beneath the flurry of the macros manipulations.p  pHow can I keep this dialog on top without turning it codemodalcodep

However, when the user undoes, the view clears out completely instead of incrementally. I feel like Im missing something, or maybe I dont understand NSUndoManager.

Negative 5579 pSuppose I have a server storing encrypted text endtoend server never sees plain text.p  pI want to be able to do full text search on that text.br  I know this is tricky, but my idea is to use the traditional full text design list and match tables where words are stored and matched with ids from the content table. When users submit the encrypted text, they also send a salted MD5 of the words and respective matches. The salt used is unique for each user and is recovered from their password.br in short the only difference is that the list table will contain hashed wordsp  pNow, how emvulnerableem would this system bebr Note that I said how vulnerable instead of how safe, because I acknowledge that it cant be totally safe.br I DO understand the tradeoff between features full text search and security disclosing some information from the word index. For example, I understand that an attacker able to get the list and match tables could get information about the original, encrypted text and empossiblyem be able to decipher some words with statistical analysis however, being the salt unique for each user, this would need to be repeated for each user.p  pHow serious would this threat be And would there be any other serious threatsp  pDISCLAIMERbr What Im trying to build and with the help of a cryptographer for actual implementation right now Im just trying to understand wether this will be possible is a consumergrade product which will deal with confidential yet not totally secret data.br My goal is just to provide something emsafe enoughem, so that it would be easier for an attacker to try stealing users passwords e.g. breaching into clients  theyre consumers, eventually rather than spending a huge amount of time and computing power trying to brute force the index or run complicated statistical analysis.p  h2Comments in response to Matthewh2  pmay be relevant for anyone else answeringp  ol lipAs you noted, other solutions are not viable. Storing all the data inside the client means that users cannot access their data from other clients. Serverside encryption would work, but then we wont be able to give users the added security of clientside encryption.brThe only true alternative is just to not implement search while this is not a required feature, its very important to meus.pli lipThe salt will be protected in the exactly same way as the users decryption key the one used to decrypt stored texts. Thus, if someone was able to capture the salt, he or she would likely be able to capture also the key, creating a much bigger issue.brTo be precise, the key and the salt will be stored encrypted on the server. They will be decrypted by the client locally with the users password and kept in memory the server never sees the decrypted key and salt. Users can change passwords, then, and they just need to reencrypt the key and the salt, and not all stored texts. This is a pretty standard approach in the industry, to my knowledge.pli lipActually, the design of the database will be as follow reporting relevant entries only. This design is like you proposed in your comment. It disallows proximity searches not very relevant to us and makes frequency less accurate.p  ul liTable codecontentcode, containing all encrypted texts. Columns are codecontent.idcode and codecontent.textcode.li liTable codewordscode, containing the list of all hashes. Columns are codewords.idcode and codewords.hashcode.li liTable codematchcode, that matches texts with hasheswords in a onetomany relationship. Columns are codematch.contentidcode and codematch.wordidcode.li ulli lipWe would have to implement features like removing stopwords etc. Sure. That is not a big issue will, of course, be done on the client. Eventually, those lists have always been of limited utility for international i.e. non Englishspeaking users.br  We expect the lookupinsert ratio to be pretty high i.e. many lookups, but rare inserts and mostly in bulk.pli lipDecrypting the whole hash database is certainly possible, but requires a brute force attack.br Suppose the salt is kept safe as per point 2 above. If the salt is long enough you cited 32 bits... but why not 320  just an example that would take A LOT of time.pli ol  pTo conclude... You confirmed my doubts about the possible risk of frequency analysis. However, I feel like this risk is emnot so highem. Can you confirm thatbr Indeed, first of all the salt would be unique per each user. This means that one user must be attacked at time.br  Second, by reporting words only once per text no matter how many times they appear, frequency analysis becomes less reliable.br  Third... Frequency analysis on hashed words doesnt sound as something as good as frequency analysis on a Caesarshift, for example. There are 250,000 words in English alone and, again, not all our users will be Englishspeaking, and even if some words are more common than others, I believe itd be hard to do this attack anyway.p  pPS The data well be storing is messages, like instant messages. These are short, contain a lot of abbreviations, slang, etc. And every person has a different style in writing texts, further reducing the risk in my opinion of frequency attacks.p

Negative 5579 pIm really sorry for this stupid question, but I just cant find it I downloaded and installed Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop, and now I want to start it. I expected I could just go to Metro and type, but nothing relevant comes up I tried to find the installation folder but cant find it. There are a few versions of Visual Studio but none of them say Express 2013. Despite how I sound, Im not a complete idiot when it comes to computers, but I just cant seem to open Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop, well, the C IDE anyway. I have read the official Getting Started guides but they dont tell me how to actually open it Why cant it be as easy as opening IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm Sorry again for this ranty question, mark me down if you have to.

Negative 5579 pI have Weblogic with datasource which can be used only by users with special role. Thats why I have to set runas role for every servlet in my webapp that needs to use DB. Also I need HttpSessionListener for detecting destroyed sessions, and this listener should make record in DB about the finished session. But by specification I cant set runas role in web.xml for this listener.p  pIs there any way to do this without tricks My only thought is to call URL that mapped to special servlet with set runas section which will do the record to DB. Or I can create TimerTask in some servlet that will check List of finished sessions and do the record, but its worse case than the servlet calling. p  pI hope more usual and straight solution exists.p

Beofre I push much updated master to the origin, I need to tag the origin in case I ever need to go back to that release version.p  pThe question is,how do I do it, with out tagging, or pushing, my modfied commmited local changesp  pI guess one strategy would be to clone the repo in a different directory, tag that, then work out how to push the tag back into the main repo orogin.p  pI am an SVN expert, to do this in SVN is trivial  you can tag the remote head without affecting current code without issue, but with git its much more involved.  Tortoise git only seems to allow you to take the local modified version.p  pTo make it more complicated, I seem to have tagged the local version at some poin with the tag I want, but I cant be sure thats the same as the current version in the origin. I guess my local tags dont get pushed into the repo by default  I assumed they would.  Thus I may end up with duplicate tags, if I checkout the origin, tag, push tag, then push my local modifiect version which also has the same tagp  pSorry for my lack of knowledge on git.p  pI did the workaround option  checkout the repo in a new dir, tag, push with tags.p
Negative 5579 pSo Im trying to work out a way to convert html to pdf entirely on the clients side, somewhere I read that you can convert a base64 to a pdf on the client side, and from there I remembered you can create a canvas from html and a Base 64 from a Canvas. So I got everything working up until converting the base64 to pdf. I cant seem to get the last part to work. Here is my codep  precodevar element   document.getElementByIdcanvas1         console.logelement if typeofelement  undefined  element  null          html2canvasdocument.body,    onrendered functioncanvas      document.body.appendChildcanvas     canvas.attr id, canvas1               setTimeoutfunction   canvas  document.getElementByIdcanvas1 var jpegUrl  canvas.toDataURLimagejpeg var pngUrl  canvas.toDataURL  PNG is the default console.logjpjpegUrl console.logpngpngUrl window.opendataapplicationpdfbase64,  pngUrl console.lognew ,500 codepre  pIm using the html2canvas library to convert the html to canvas and attach it to the body, and so far that works flawlessly. But why cant I convert the base64 to pdf. It just opens a blank page with the url data as if its not loading the base64 string with it. Any help would be appreciated, I might be over thinking this and im sure there is an easier way. Here is a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8Q582 relnofollowjsfiddlea of the problem.p

Negative 5579 pIve been searching the web for about 2 days trying to identify the differences and possible advantagesdisadvantages to using all PDO or all MySQL for transactions.p  pIm doing approximately 20 inserts per member and you can register multiple members simultaneously so the number of queries can go from 20 to 100 easily and our estimation of activity can range from hundreds to thousands of these to occur per hour.p  pI know about transactions but what I dont seem to grasp is if theres much difference between having all of the inserts batched into one PDO prepare or to have them all separated. Examplep  precodestmt1  pdogtpreparequery1 stmt2  pdogtpreparequery2 stmt3  pdogtpreparequery3 stmt4  pdogtpreparequery4 ....  pdogtbeginTransaction  try   foreachmembers as member        stmt1gtexecutemember     stmt2gtexecutemember     stmt3gtexecutemember     stmt4gtexecutemember     ....      pdogtcommit catchException e    pdogtrollback  codepre  pCompared to something along the linesp  precodeInserts for ALL members sql   START TRANSACTION INSERT INTO... INSERT INTO... INSERT INTO... INSERT INTO... INSERT INTO... INSERT INTO... COMMIT  try   pdogtpreparesql   stmtgtexecutemember  catchException e    pdogtqueryROLLBACK  codepre  pCan this create overhead with having to send the queries one at a time and then continue parsing on the PHP side or could it benefit to send it all at once through one PDO callp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI noticed the confusion in the second example, Ive editted it. For clarity, the question is referring to potential hangup in highvolume traffic using multiple PHPside queries PDO executing each SQL statement one at a time, still within ONE transaction compared to sending a large block of SQL with one PDO execute still only ONE transaction.p

Negative 5579 pI created a custom content control with its default template.  The template though is not located in the location ThemesGeneric.xaml as it is supposed to be. Instead I placed it in a separate resource dictionary with a different name.  It is merged along with other resource dictionaries in the App.xaml resource dictionary.p  pRunning the code yielded no errors and the control is visible. I tested the application on other machines and the code ran just fine , I would like to point out that these machines are development machines. p  pTesting the application on the client machines non development then revealed some strange behaviour. The custom control was not visible it would only be visible on 1 out 3 client machines.p  pI was able to fix the problem by putting the template in ThemesGeneric.xaml. p  pMy question is how was it able to work without having to put the template in ThemesGeneric.xaml  I have searched on Google but I could find any clear cut explaination .p  pThank youp

Negative 5579 pI just started testing my iOS7 app on iOS8 with Xcode 6 beta 6. I am aware that iOS 8 has deprecated the push and modal segue but I was happy to find that all my segues worked... except one.p  pI built a demo app to show that unwinding from a modal segue seems to be broken if your app uses a UITabBarController with UINavigationController. I saw another unwind segue post, but it was using swift, where as my demo app is using objc.p  pHere is what I am seeing more specifically [UITabBarContoller]  [UINavigationController]  [SomeViewController] Modal Segue [This ViewController Cannot Unwind]p  pInterestingly, you CAN unwind if you do another modal segue [UITabBarContoller]  [UINavigationController]  [SomeViewController] Modal Segue1 [This ViewController Cannot Unwind] Modal Segue2 [This ViewController CAN unwind]p  pI also found I can unwind if I remove either the UITabBarController or the UINavigationController, but I do not plan on changing my entire app UI architecture p  pFrom what I can see, the root view controller never receives a call to canPerformUnwindSegueActionfromViewControllerwithSender which it does in iOS7.p  pMy Question Is there a different way I should try to get my unwind segue to workp  pThanks for reading.p  pDemo code is here a hrefhttpsgithub.comnmsasakiUnwindDemo relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnmsasakiUnwindDemoap  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThis issue seems to have been fixed by iOS8.1. The iOS 8.0 work around of creating a custom subclass of UINavigationController continues to work.p

Negative 5579 pI am supposed to determine the probability of 4 of a kind in a 5 card poker draw using Matlab. I understand the first thing I have to do is generate a deck and shuffle the cards, then draw 5 cards. I am having trouble with determining whether the hand is 4 of a kind or not. I have written the code below, which works for shuffling the deck and drawing 5 cards. I have tried to use an if statement to determine if the hand is a 4 of a kind or not, but it does not work. My reasoning behind the if statement was that if I already had a sorted vector, the only two possibilities would be the first 4 or the last 4 numbers should all equal each otherp  pEx.

Negative 5579 pI would like to override the default codeThread.UncaughtExceptionHandlercode in my whole application in order to launch a new errordisplaying codeActivitycode whenever something goes wrong.p  pI was able to write some code and get it halfworking, but theres a problem that I just cant figure out how to fix. The class that extends codeThread.UncaughtExceptionHandlercode can launch a new codeActivitycode if an uncaught exception occurs any time after codeonCreatecode in one of the other Activities of the application. However, if an uncaught exception occurs in codeonCreatecode or before the UI is drawn on the screen, my errordisplaying codeActivitycode does not launch and my app just kindof hangs there.p  pI can reverse this behavior by saving the default codeThread.UncaughtExceptionHandlercode and passing the uncaught codeThrowablecode to it in codeuncaughtExceptioncode.

Negative 5579 pI have a VB.NET application that is referencing a VB6 dll via the standard COM Interop method. Everything was working fine until I added some extra functionality to my VB6 dll. I recompiled and registered the dll, removed the reference from my VB.NET application and added it again. I have since been greeted with error above. I thought the problem was related to my new code so I created a very simple Hello World function in the dll for testing purposes and attempted to invoke that from my VB.NET application...same problem.p  pI have since been searching and deleting all versions of the dll, removing what appears to be obsolete references from the registry...all with no success.p  pDoes anybody know what has happenedp  pThankyou in advancep

Negative 5579 pI have a range with 170000 rows in it. Im filtering column A for a single value and returning the corresponding values in column B.p  pI want these values to dump into an array so I can quickly toss them into a dictionary with the key being the value I filtered column A with.p  pThe problem is that SpecialCellsxlCellTypeVisible is acting inconsistent.p  pIf I do the same test on a smaller range, the values dump into the array just fine. But with a range as large as mine, it only returns the first value in the range. Also, I can use the same line to copy to another sheet. I just cant get it to populate the array.p  precodefoo  ws1.Rangetbl1Name amp [ID].SpecialCellsxlCellTypeVisible codepre  pWorks with small ranges, but returns only the first result in a range as large as mine less than 50 results. foo becomes an array containing all the variables.p  precodews1.Rangetbl1Name amp [ID].SpecialCellsxlCellTypeVisible.Copy ws2.RangeA1 codepre  pWorks with the large range and copies all the relevant data successfully.p  pSo my question How do I populate the array without the extra step of copying to a blank worksheet when autofiltering a large table range Excel 2013p
Negative 5579 pHow can we determine the base address of the L2 page table Using ARM CortexA9p  pFor example, if I have a programme which requires 7KB of data space and starts at the address 0x0, I need two pages of 4KB. To do that, I add an entry in the L1 page table which points to the L2 page table base address. Then I add two entries in the L2 page table like that with addr  0x0 for the first page and 0x1000 for the second onep  precodeu32 ptr u32 smallpage  smallpage  addr  0x1000 ptr         smallpage  L2tablebaseaddr ptr        addr amp 0xFFFFF  attributes codepre  pNow there is one thing that I still do not understand.  How can I determine the L2 page table base address Should I put the table right after the L1 page tablep  pWhere can I store the address I know that the base address of the L1 page table is stored in a coprocessor register but I did not find any register to store the L2 base address.p  pAnother question to be sure, both coprocessor register TTBR0 and TTBR1 holds the base address of a L1 page. Each to its own. It is not TTBR0 for L1 and TTBR1 for L2, does it p

Negative 5579 pI use WPF Toolkit to draw a chart with a columnseries. I use a DateTimeAxis X axis and a LinearAxis Y axis. I have different ways of showing the data, depending on user input. I either show data for hours, days, weeks, months or years. This should reflect on the DateTimeAxis. Therefore I use IntervalType, which works great for everything, except weeks. The week interval in this tool starts on Sunday, but in my country our week starts on monday. This results in the label being 02112014 Sunday, but my data point is showing right beside it 03112014 Mondayp  pViewmodel binding to IntervalTypep  precodeswitch timeFrame.Frequency        case PerformanceTimeFrame.DataDensity.Hourly                IntervalType  DateTimeIntervalType.Hours         break            case PerformanceTimeFrame.DataDensity.Weekly                IntervalType  DateTimeIntervalType.Weeks         break            case PerformanceTimeFrame.DataDensity.Monthly                IntervalType  DateTimeIntervalType.Months         break            case PerformanceTimeFrame.DataDensity.Yearly                IntervalType  DateTimeIntervalType.Years         break            default                IntervalType  DateTimeIntervalType.Days         break           codepre  pxaml axisp  precodeltchartingChart.Axesgt     ltchartingLinearAxis OrientationY ShowGridLinesTrue Minimum0 Maximum105 gt     ltchartingDateTimeAxis NameDateTimeAx OrientationX MaximumBinding MaxDate MinimumBinding MinDate IntervalTypeBinding IntervalType IntervalBinding IntervalValue AxisLabelStyleStaticResource RotatedAxesLabelStylegt   ltchartingChart.Axesgt codepre  pExample of problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comumo6l.png altStartday Sundayp  pAnyone know how I can change the startday to monday, or do some workaroundp  pPlease let me now if you need more information.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 5579 pI am using pandas to read a text file filled with numerical data.

I am currently able to return the rows containing a specified column integer value usingp  precodeimport pandas as pd  integer  some integer df  pd.readcsv...  array  df[df[i]  integer] codepre  pThis successfully returns all rows containing a particular integer value and assigns to a dataframe named array. p  pI am unable, however, to return rows which contain a specified floating point value using the same method. It simply returns an empty array, although I know that a row containing my test value is present in the data. p  pAdditionally, I dont simply want to search for an exact float value, but I need to search for an approximate float value in the columns. For example, say the nominal userspecified value is .6, the experimental value may actually have been .59993 or .60004. So I need for the user to input .6 and python search for values which are slightly greater than or less than .6.p  pHere is an example of what I have triedp  precodeimport pandas as pd  somefloat  .6 df  pd.readcsv...  array  df[df[i] lt somefloat.01 and gt somefloat.01] codepre  pAll attempts at using the various operators have resulted in a ValueError the truth value of an series is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.any or a.all. However, this may be partly due to it not reading float values at all. Ultimately, the dataset which is extracted from the initial dataframe will be uniquely identified by a specified integer value and a float value. p  pThanksp

Every item x has a path [0]p  pExample 3 Inputp  precodelist  [[x,x,x],[x,x,x]] codepre  pOutputp  precodelist  [[[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]],[[0,1],[0,1],[0,1]]] codepre  pExplanation List contains two lists so first branch 0 has two more branches on it. In that case all items on that level two branch are [0,0] and on the second branch [0,1]. p  pcan this be done recursively in some manner that will work on any depthcomplexity of list of lists p  pI understand that this is not a bugissue, but I am a bit of a noob and recursive functions are still a mystery to me. Any help will be much appreciated. Even simple pseudo code to get me started. thank you,p

Negative 5579 pI have a problem that I have been trying to solve and have been hitting Google most of the day with no joy.p  pI have a Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 system and the business is looking to allocate tasks to the sales reps by Account.p  pSo for example we may create a task for Check product XYZ pricing is correct for Feb promotion  This task would then be assigned to the Accounts that it applied to, via say an Advanced Find.p  pI can do this with a workflow but that requires a workflow per task when I will have a number of these tasks, each with a separate list of target Accounts.  I thought maybe use a dialog but those are limited to single account usage.  Set up a Marketing Campaign for a single task looked like too much overhead to be the right way.p  pSo in the ideal world I would select a group of Accounts that meet a specific set of requirements, then create a task Activity, which would be cloned across the selected Accounts.p  pAny ideas here  Or have I missed some basic functionality in the system.p  pThanks Davep

So the desired effect is that the cartoon appears when the page is loaded, then if the user scrolls it disappears for at least three seconds and the delay gets reset so that the sprite is not present when the user is scrolling. When the user is finished scrolling, the sprite needs to reappear. Sounds obnoxious, I know, but its crucial to the project Im working on.

Negative 5579 pI was just reading about How does a server handles multiple requests and ended up with java multithreading and multiple cores cpu.p  pDuring the days when the computers were single core and if there are 2 threads in java at the same time then jvm scheduler will take care of giving time to each thread. So, two threads never runs in parallel but makes use of ideal time e.g. if a thread is blocked on some resource.p  pBut is this is case with multiple cores and forkjoin framework in java7  I mean i have heard that with multiple cores we can actually achieve parallelism. So, if i have two threads running, two cores cpu and each thread is given a separate core it is not guaranteed though then will they actually be parallel because jvm scheduler will still lead to time interleavingp  pI am sorry if this question is stupid but i am really not sure on this one. Please help me to understandp  pThanks Ouneyp

Negative 5579 pI would like to perform a block wise FFT on an image in Matlab where the FFT is calculated for every pixel in the image and a KxK environment of that pixel. If the input image size is MxN, the output image size would be KMxKN where each pixel is now represented by a KxK block that is the FFT of said environment.p  pI am currently doing this using the built in Matlab function blockproc, but it turns out to run very slowly for an image of size 576x768 pixels. I could do it with old fashioned for loops to gain some efficiency but it seems too similar to the operation of convolution on an image but without the summation. Meaning, if I take my filter to be a tweedle matrix corresponding to the FFT, I put it centered on a specific pixel and multiply element by element I would get a KxK matrix corresponding to that specific pixel, which is exactly what conv does but without the summation. Since Matlab has very efficient implementations of the convolution operation, I was wondering if it is possible to do this using builtin Matlab functions that may involve convolution or something similar.p

Negative 5579 pI am making an angular app but I have found an instance where I need to use jQuery. I need to click a button which raises a click event on another hidden button. I know this seems odd but I need this functionality because an angular module I am using, ngfileupload, will not work on styled icons. p  pMy solution was to create two buttons, one hidden, one transparent. I then put the styled icon on the transparent button and made the other button hidden. I then used jQuery to cause the second button to be clicked when the first is clicked. This works fine in modern firefoxchrome but not at all in IE8.p  precodeltbutton idfirstClick classfa facameraretrogtltbuttongt ltbutton nghidetrue idsecondClick ngfileselect ngmodelfilesgtUploadltbuttongt codepre  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodedocument.onclick, firstClick, function      secondClick.triggerclick  codepre  pI am currently using jQuery version 1.10.2.

Also I set secondClick to visible and when I click it directly it fires ngfileselect.p

Negative 5579 pI have been reading model relations in Loopback, but I am not sure how you would save relations when persisting data models. Let me use the following example. p  pTwo models strongCategorystrong, and strongArticlestrongp  precodeA Category has many Articles, which uses a foreign key categoryId  codepre  pSuppose there is a web page that has a dropdown category list and the value for each category in the list is their autoincremented codeIdcode in database. Below the dropdown list, theres an input field and a text box for you to input article title and text body. Now my question is  p  pWhen you hit the save button, the codeArticle modelcode along with the selected codecategory Idcode to the POST API for articles. I was wondering how you would save the onetomany relation. Do you retrieve the category object for the category Id and save it with the aricle object or you would just save the article object with the category Id in the strongArticlestrong database table p  pI have a background in Hibernate, but not sure how to use the relation properly in loopback. Replies are appreciated very much, and an example would be great. p  pstrongEditstrong well this is not a direct answer to my question, but I found this github repo very helpful in achieving what I was looking for, and it offers good examples for integrating angularJS and loopback as the backend.

Negative 5579 pWhen I first got a Haswell processor I tried implementing FMA to determine the Mandelbrot set. The main algorithm is thisp  precodeintn  0 forint32t i0 iltmaxiter i      floatn x2  squarex, y2  squarey squarex  xx     floatn r2  x2  y2     booln mask  r2ltcut booln is in the float domain non integer domain     ifhorizontalormask break mm256testzpdmask     n  mask     floatn t  xy mul2t mul2t t2     x  x2  y2  cx     y  t  cy  codepre  pThis determines if codencode pixels are in the Mandelbrot set. So for double floating point it runs over 4 pixels codefloatn  m256dcode, codeintn  m256icode.  This requires 4 SIMD floating point multiplication and four SIMD floating point additions.p  pThen I modified this to work with FMA like thisp  precodeintn n  0  forint32t i0 iltmaxiter i      floatn r2  muladdx,x,yy     booln mask  r2ltcut     ifhorizontalormask break     addmaskn,mask     floatn t  xy     x  mulsubx,x, mulsuby,y,cx     y  muladd2.0f,t,cy  codepre  pwhere muladd calls codemm256fmadpdcode and mulsub calls codemm256fmsubpdcode.  This method uses 4 FMA SIMD operations, and two SIMD multiplications which is two less arithmetic operations then without FMA. Additionally, FMA and multiplication can use two ports and addition only one.p  pTo make my tests less biased I zoomed into a region which is entirely in the Mandelbrot set so all the values are codemaxitercode. In this case strongthe method using FMA is about 27 faster.strong Thats certainly an improvement but going from SSE to AVX doubled my performance so I was hoping for maybe another factor of two with FMA.p  pBut then I found a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions13292013isthereanyscenariowherefunctionfmainlibccanbeused1823979518239795thisa answer in regards to FMA where it says p  blockquote   pThe important aspect of the fusedmultiplyadd instruction is the virtually infinite precision of the intermediate result. This helps with performance, but not so much because two operations are encoded in a single instruction  It helps with performance because the virtually infinite precision of the intermediate result is sometimes important, and very expensive to recover with ordinary multiplication and addition when this level of precision is really what the programmer is after.p blockquote  pand later gives an example of doubledouble to a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiQuadrupleprecisionfloatingpointformatDoubledoublearithmeticdoubledoublea multiplication p  precodehigh  a  b  doubleprecision approximation of the real product  low  fmaa, b, high  remainder of the real product  codepre  pFrom this, I concluded that I was implementing FMA nonoptimally and so I decided to implement SIMD doubledouble. I implemented doubledouble based on the paper a hrefhttpandrewthall.orgpapersdf64qf128.pdfExtendedPrecision FloatingPoint Numbers for GPU Computationa. The paper is for doublefloat so I modified it for doubledouble. Additionally, instead of packing one doubledouble value in a SIMD registers I pack 4 doubledouble values into one AVX high register and one AVX low register.p  pFor the Mandelbrot set what I really need is doubledouble multiplication and addition. In that paper these are the codedf64addcode and codedf64multcode functions. The image below shows the assembly for my codedf64multcode function for a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions28630864howisfmaimplemented3012121730121217software FMAa left and hardware FMA right. This clearly shows that hardware FMA is a big improvement for doubledouble multiplication.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com23Ezv.png altfma software vs hardwarep  pSo how does hardware FMA perform in the doubledouble Mandelbrot set calculation strongThe answer is thats only about 15 faster than with software FMA. Thats much less than I hoped for.strong The doubledouble Mandelbrot calculation needs 4 doubledouble additions, and four doubledouble multiplications codexxcode, codeyycode, codexycode, and code2xycode. However, the a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions7720668fastmultiplicationdivisionby2forfloatsanddoublescc3045384230453842code2xycode multiplication is trivial for doubledoublea so this multiplication can be ignored in the cost. Therefore, the reason I think the improvement using hardware FMA is so small is that the calculation is dominated by the slow doubledouble addition see the assembly below.p  pIt used to be that multiplication was slower than addition and programers used several tricks to avoid multiplication but with Haswell it seems that its the other way around. Not only due to FMA but also because multiplication can use two ports but addition only one. p  pSo my questions finally arep  ol liHow does one optimize when addition is slow compared to multiplication li liIs there an algebraic way to change my algorithm to use more multiplications  and less additions I know there are method to do the reverse, e.g. codexyxy  xxyy  2xycode which use two more additions for one less multiplication.li liIs there a way to simply the df64add function e.g. using FMAli ol  pIn case anyone is wondering the doubledouble method is about ten times slower than double. Thats not so bad I think as if there was a hardware quadprecision type it would likely be at least twice as slow as double so my software method is about five times slower than what I would expect for hardware if it existed. p  pcodedf64addcode assemblyp  precodevmovapd 8rsp, ymm0 movq    rdi, rax vmovapd 72rsp, ymm1 vmovapd 40rsp, ymm3 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm0, ymm4 vmovapd 104rsp, ymm5 vsubpd  ymm0, ymm4, ymm2 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm1, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm4, ymm2 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm0, ymm0 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm0, ymm2 vaddpd  ymm5, ymm3, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm3, ymm1, ymm6 vsubpd  ymm6, ymm5, ymm5 vsubpd  ymm6, ymm1, ymm6 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm2, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm6, ymm3, ymm3 vaddpd  ymm1, ymm4, ymm2 vaddpd  ymm5, ymm3, ymm3 vsubpd  ymm4, ymm2, ymm4 vsubpd  ymm4, ymm1, ymm1 vaddpd  ymm3, ymm1, ymm0 vaddpd  ymm0, ymm2, ymm1 vsubpd  ymm2, ymm1, ymm2 vmovapd ymm1, rdi vsubpd  ymm2, ymm0, ymm0 vmovapd ymm0, 32rdi vzeroupper ret codepre

Negative 5579 pI am trying to create a hovertooltip using Bootstrap UI. The tooltip should be visible when mouse is hovered on the button, the tooltip has a link which should be clickable. But the default popover and tooltip provided by Bootstrap UI, disappear when mouse comes out of it.  I have searched a lot online, but couldnt find a solution. Some sites have given a solution using jQuery, but my requirement is in AngularJS. Many sites cite that we have to use tooltipProvider, could you please tell me how to write a customEvent for mouseenter and mouseleave inside the controller.p

What I am trying to write is a bootstrap table which is populated by Parse.com to present some information. A user should be able to click on the rows and editdelete them at will.

It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular      modules, e.g.     LogLevel info sslwarn      ErrorLog APACHELOGDIRerror.log     CustomLog APACHELOGDIRaccess.log combined       For most configuration files from confavailable, which are      enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to      include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the      following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only      after it has been globally disabled with a2disconf.     Include confavailableservecgibin.conf     SSLEngine on     SSLCertificateFile etcapache2sslapache.crt     SSLCertificateKeyFile etcapache2sslapache.key     ltVirtualHostgt codepreli ol
Negative 5579 pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pIs it possible to use Phalanger a hrefhttpsphalanger.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpsphalanger.codeplex.coma in ASP.NET MVC for just one view and leave everything else using the normal Razor View Enginep  pstrongSITUATIONstrongp  pI am currently using ELFinder in my site which I integrated using the ELFinder Connector for .NET.p  pIdeally, I would like to integrate the Responsive File Manager, here a hrefhttpwww.responsivefilemanager.comindex.php relnofollowhttpwww.responsivefilemanager.comindex.phpap  pUnfortunately, the aforementioned file manager is written for PHP.p  pI have read that PHP can be used within MVC using Phalanger see a hrefhttpwww.infoq.comarticlesPhalanger relnofollowhttpwww.infoq.comarticlesPhalangerap  pAnd I am wondering whether it is at possible to create a PHP view and make this file manager work for my site while at the same time leaving all other pages alone.p  pNote, I know nothing of PHP at all...p  pIf this is at all possible, how would I go about starting to do thisp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI found a simple implementation of an strongMVC PHP View Enginestrong here which is based on strongPhalangerstrong a hrefhttpsphpviewengine.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpsphpviewengine.codeplex.comap  pI seem to have sort of got it working with TinyMCE.

I did get a bit further  I upgraded to Phalanger 4 as advised and also updated to MVC5 while I was at it. It seems the code is being run, but still not successfully.

I will even start a bounty for a large number of points when allowed to and reward it to whoever can give the best answer... as having this file manager in ASP.NET would indeed be awesome.p  pstrongEDIT 4strongp  pI am making some pretty good progress now, having worked out a few issues... see screenshot below for current status. I even have it where I am using ONLY strong.cshtmlstrong files the PHP files being called by the file manager are simply being processed by the PHP View Engine, so this is really, really fantastic. It seems I have some more issues to deal with.. if I manage to get it working properly, I will post the solution here for the benefit of others.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJFbye.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 5579 pMy company has a total of 20 sites 10 client production sites and a QA site for each client. We have our QA sites on the production server to allow our testers to test the QA version of the site on the actual production server before promoting it to the live site. Also, all 20 sites are the exact same except for a client ID stored in the web.config file which tells the site which database to pull data from.  Yes I know we could have just 1 site and dynamically change which DB based on login or URL but thats not my call and Im sure there are valid reasons for the way it is designed. However, my question is about the application pools. Each site has its own application pool too currently 20 application pools. I was thinking of cutting that back to just 2 application pools  one for QA sites and one for the production sites. But, im no IIS master. So, I would like to know if its better to set up each site with its own application pool or have sites share a single application pool.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5579 pWhat is the best way to generate an OTP One Time Password or a random short string and encrypt it in java Im familiar with MD5, sha256. But Im guessing that is not enough since there are still better ways to generate an OTP string and some uses an algorithm which I am not that familiar with on how it works. For example the RFC 6238 on TOTP TimeBased OneTime Password Algorithm. which is used for OTP. Will this create a code that will use the current time it was createdp  pAlso found this example online on encrypting strings using java a hrefhttpwww.code2learn.com201106encryptionanddecryptionofdatausing.html relnofollowencrypting string in javaap  pBasically what im trying to achieve here is to securely generate a code that is less prone to be predicted by hackers and secure it. so maybe ill generate a code using the current date and time and the age of the user.p  pSo if anyone would be able to guide me on which direction I should focus if I want the best way to generate a short length code and encrypt it.

The application also requires codestage.setIconnifiedcode, but this does not work if the stage is undecorated.p  pAny suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks p
