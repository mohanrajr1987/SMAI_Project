My problem is now, that some of the enums have lt 250 entries and only the javadoc of the entries says information about the value.

Positive 1532 pI am unmarshalling an XML file into a JAXBgenerated Java object.  I would like the unmarshaller to validate the file against the schema in the process.

The schema has some complex types factored out into other code.xsdcode files.  The unmarshaller doesnt appear to be able to find the factoredout code.xsdcode files because when I attempt to set the schema Im getting the codeSAXExceptioncodep  precodeCannot resolve the name tnsFactoredOutType to an type definition component. codepre  pNote This works fine when running from eclipse, when it references the code.xsdcode files from the codetargetcode folder instead of from the code.jarcode file.p  pAnybody have any ideas how I can get the factoredout code.xsdcode files working for a schema that is in a dependencys code.jarcode filep  pEditp  pIn case its helpful information, the toplevel code.xsdcode is in a codemodelcode folder, and the type it references is in codemodelcommoncode, so I reference the toplevel code.xsdcode asp  precodemodelTopLevel.xsd codepre  p... and inside it, it references the factoredout code.xsdcode asp  precodecommonFactoredOut.xsd codepre

Positive 1532 pIn my Java Maven project Im using a hrefhttpsjaxb.java.net relnofollowJAXB 2.2.11a to rebuild instances of a class from an XML payload received by our servers. I have an code.xsdcode schema defining the class, which works great in conjunction with JAXB to rebuild an instance of the type I want. The issue Im having is that those payloads can without any notice or warning have extra elements which I dont really care about.p  pOne of the places where those extra elements can appear is within an codexsallcode tag. I do like having the functionality of said a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comschemaelall.asp relnofollowcodexsallcodea tagp  blockquote   pThe all element specifies that the child elements can appear in any   order and that each child element can occur zero or one time.p blockquote  pHowever, I dont want to get a parsing error while processing an XML payload that contains extra attributes. An codexsanycode tag inside the codexsallcode would work great, but its not permitted in XSD 1.0 according to a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comschemaelsequence.asp relnofollow titlew3schoolsw3schoolsa and this other a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3367162289011SO answera and apparently, JAXB doesnt support XSD 1.1. Also, the way codeJAXBcode treats the codeanycode or the codeanyAttributecode is very interesting, because it puts all the unknown nodes into a map, so I can log it saying emHey We are receiving an attribute that we dont really care about as of now, but maybe youll find it somehow useful in the futureemp  pIve read about a hrefhttpsxsom.java.net relnofollowXsoma, that supports XSD 1.1, but apparently, it doesnt return an eminstanceem of the class you want, but more generic set of hashmaps and lists, therefore losing my type checking, which is something I dont want to.p  pSo... Is there any way of empretendingem to have an codexsanycode within an codexsallcodep

Negative 1532 pLet me summarize this shortly A First Responder in a nib file is an object, which represents the UI control element that has the users focus. So if the user clicks on a control, the nib sets that clicked UI control as First Responder. In my app I could make an outlet to that First Responder from the nib, so that I could for example send a message make red font color to whatever the user has activated by clicking.p  pAnd then, if this First Responder UI control does not understand that message, the message gets passed up in the responder chain, until a parent element or grandparent and so on UI control element understands the message. Otherwise it will be ignored.p  pSo First Responder always establishes a link to the UI control that has focus.

I need a http server that has support for compiled CGI scripts exe, for Windows, and must be able to use relative paths. It would be a bonus if the server could be a minimallightweight as possible.p  pThe hardest part in my search thus far is finding a server that supports both CGI and has relative path support. When I say relative path, I mean the server root directory.

If I were to run the server as a process in a my program C .NET, what would be the current directory then Would I have to make sure Ive changed the current directory environment variable prior to launching itp

Negative 1532 pThe problem is p  pWe have taken over a website which has an active member community. Weve been given the application and database dump and have the site running on a new server successfully and the DNS has been switched. p  pThe problem is that database has come out of sync in the time it took to get the files to us and the DNS switched over. Now that the DNS has switched and there is no chance of the database going out of sync, weve been handed members2 which is the table from the original server with the extra data.p  pBoth tables look like this p  precodeidmembers int10 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement, firstName varchar20 default NOT NULL, lastName varchar20 default NOT NULL, email varchar255 default NOT NULL, date varchar10 default 0, source varchar50 default signup  PRIMARY KEY  idmembers,  UNIQUE KEY email email codepre  pSo the first table is called members1 and is the live database, which is missing a load of members from members2.  I need to merge them both together keeping members1 as it is and allowing unique emails from members2 to be inserted into members1. p  pI am presuming that there is some SQL to do this but I have no idea what it could be. p  pMy second and less preferable approach would be to use a tool like PhpMyAdmin to export all the records from members2 after a certain date and reimport them into members1 but the problem is they all export from members2 with an idmembers that conflict with members1 as an autoincrement is used in both  p

Negative 1532 pMy application is written in C and I am a newbie to C. I am facing with a problem during serialization. The serialization that is used is custom serialization using ISerializable interface. The problem is as follows.p  pThere are many classes in my project and when serialization is called on one of the main class object it serializes itself and during this process many of the member objects are also get serialized. This whole serialization is done in to a file with extension say .bin. This bin file size should be of size max 20MB.p  pIn this process of serialization one of my other class also gets serialized to a stream, this class is having a big array. The size of this array or list can be of 80 MB or more. So during serialization i have serialize all the objects other than this array and depending upon the size left in the 20MB I need to add in between the serialization the number of array elements which can fit in the remaining memory.p  pFor the other array elements left out I have to create a similar kind of .bin file with all the objects serialized and in between need to insert the number of array elements that can fit there.p  pThe main problem here is the array elements get inserted at runtime and this list keeps on increasing. So i should be creating .bin files continuously until my application runs.p  pAny ideas how can i implement a solution for this problemp  pThanks in Advance.p  pLet me put my above question in other way. I shall serialize my main object into a file and later when required i shall open the file and parse it to the point i require and insert some extra data at that point.

Negative 1532 pI would like to remove the resizing border from my WPF custom window. I already found that I have to handle the WMNCCALCSIZE message and return 0. That removes the border and aligns the window to the top left corner of the window. The problem is that by doing so, the client area increases and the WPF root control doesnt. That creates black edges on the left and bottom sides of the window that I would like to get rid of.p  pIm using VS2010 C Windows XP and would like this to work under both Windows XP and Windows 7.p  pThanks in Advance.p  pEDIT I found out what is causing the black edges, they are the window behind. Now it seems that the problem is with the root element of the window not occupying the whole window. When I set its margin to negative values it draws over the black area. Apparently the layout pass is ok and the desired size is the same as the window but the render size is different.p  pI also found out that the whole problem could be solved by removing WSTHICKFRAME from the window style. The problem with that is the resizing functionality that is enabled only when WSTHICKFRAME is used. Im using WMNCHITTEST to do the resizing and if the window knows it doesnt have a resizing border, it will shutdown its resizing functionality.p  pI would like to make the root element occupy the whole window to eliminate the black window background or alternatively enable the native resizing functionality without the thick frame.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1532 pIm working on a Ruby on Rails web app, in which Ive got several lists of posts. Each post will use Ajax to load their comments.

So, for example if the post.id is 12, the id will be mydiv12.p  pMy controllers action looks like thisp  precoderender update do page     page.replacehtml mydiv  params[postid].tos, partial gt mycommentssectionpartialpath end codepre  pThat works fine only if I have a post only once at the page. But in this site, each post might be listed more than once, because there are several lists latest posts, popular, tops, etc. And all of them will have their Comments section to show.p  pThe issue now is that, as the comments section functionality is inside a partial view, it will work the same for every type of list as its expected, and therefore, it doesnt make the difference between the divs because they will have the same post.id, and thus, the same divs id.p  pMy question now is how could I solv this problem Is there a better and different way for doing thisp  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pJust to clarify what I want, in few wordsp  pI would like the code codepage.replacehtml mydiv  params[postid].tos, partial gt mycommentssectionpartialpathcode to replace that partial in strongEVERY divstrong called codemydiv  params[postid].toscode strongbecause there may be more than one div in the same page with the same idstrong.p

The problem is that if the banner is too wide for the space provided, it jumps to a space below the menu where it is wider and takes all of the pages content with it.p  pstrongAttempted solutionsstrongp  pThe obvious solution is to use the overflow hidden property in my css.

Negative 1532 pWe have some shared assemblies that get build automatically every night. When there are no changes made to the sources, i would expect the assembly binaries to be exactly the same as a previous version.p  pHowever, there seem to be minor differences between assemblies.p  pI have done some effort to determine the difference between two builds. I used codeildasmcode to generate an il version, and compared the resulting text versions. The only difference in IL is the MVID a random guid in the module.p  pSome googling tells me that the module version id gets generated by the compiler, so it is possible to determine the build source, even when everything else is the same.p  pThis MVID creates an artificial diff betweeen builds of the same code, and an artificial checkin of the resulting assembly.p  pIs it possible to supply the MVID to the C compiler  p

Negative 1532 pstrongAccessing a WPF FlowDocument in the BackGroundstrongp  pMy question relates to accessing a UI object, in the background in WPF. I have seen dozens of sample apps, that all are simple, easy to follow, and 95 of which tell you how display a progress bar. Thats not quite what I want.. p  pMy problem is this I want to perform a long task or many long tasks by accessing a FlowDocument in a RichTextBox. The exact task isnt relevant here, but an example might be to scan through the document, and count the number of times a particular word appears, or how many red characters there are. In a long document, those could be fairly time consuming tasks, and if done in the foreground, would tie up the UI considerably and make it unresponsive.  I only want to parse the FlowDocument I do not want to make any changes to it.p  pSo thats the kind of thing Im trying to do. The obvious solution is to do it in the background, but the question ishow I have achieved what emappearsem to be an answer, but it just doesnt feel right to me, which is why I am here asking for help.p  pstrongMy Solutionstrongp  pMy solution which follows uses a BackgroundWorker which calls the UI objects Dispatcher to ensure the right thread is accessedand it appears to do the job. But does it..............  I have considerably abbreviated my solution to make it easy I hope to follow what I am doing.p    pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodeWithEvents worker As BackgroundWorker Private Delegate Sub DelegateSub Private theDocument As FlowDocument   ltsummarygt  Triggers the background task. Can call from anywhere in main code blocks  ltsummarygt Private Sub StartTheBackgroundTask      worker  New BackgroundWorker     worker.RunWorkerAsync  End Sub   ltsummarygt  In the background, hands the job over to the UI objects Dispatcher  ltsummarygt Private Sub HandleWorkerDoWorkByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DoWorkEventArgs Handles worker.DoWork      Dim priority As System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority     Dim theLongRunningTask As DelegateSub      1 Define a delegate for the Dispatcher to work with     theLongRunningTask  New DelegateSubAddressOf DoTheTimeConsumingTask      2 Set Dispatcher priority as required     priority  System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Background      3 Add the job to the FlowDocuments Dispatchers tasks     theDocument.Dispatcher.BeginInvoketheLongRunningTask, priority  End Sub   ltsummarygt  Sub whose logic accesses, but does not change, the UI object   ltsummarygt Private Sub DoTheTimeConsumingTask      For example......      For Each bl As Block In theDocument.Blocks          ......do something      Next  End Sub codepre  pAlthough that seems to work, the problem as I see it is that apart from triggering the task with the BackgroundWorker, pretty much ALL the long running task is handled by the UI objects Dispatcher. So the BackgroundWorker doesnt actually do any work. Thats the part that concerns me I cant see how I am gaining anything, if the Dispatcher is tied up doing all the workp  pstrongOption 2strongp  pSo, it seemed more logical to me that I would be better to twist this around a little and set the Dispatchers delegate to point to the sub that instantiates and starts the BackGroundWorker my thinking being that the Dispatcher thread would then own the BackgroundWorkers thread, and to do all the work in the BackgroundWorkers DoWork event.  That felt right.p  pSo I tried this, instead p    pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodeWithEvents worker As BackgroundWorker Private Delegate Sub DelegateSub Private theDocument As FlowDocument   ltsummarygt  Triggers the background task. Can call from anywhere in main code blocks  ltsummarygt Private Sub StartTheBackgroundTask      Dim priority As System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority     Dim theTask As DelegateSub      1 Define a delegate for the Dispatcher to work with     theTask  New DelegateSubAddressOf RunWorker      2 Set Dispatcher priority as required     priority  System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Normal      3 Add the job to the Dispatchers tasks     theDocument.Dispatcher.BeginInvoketheTask, priority  End Sub   ltsummarygt  Creates and starts a new BackGroundWorker object  ltsummarygt Private Sub RunWorker      Worker  New BackgroundWorker     Worker.RunWorkerAsync  End Sub   ltsummarygt  Does the long task in the DoWork event  ltsummarygt Private Sub HandleWorkerDoWorkByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DoWorkEventArgs Handles worker.DoWork      DoTheTimeConsumingTask  End Sub   ltsummarygt  Sub whose logic accesses, but does not change, the UI object   ltsummarygt Private Sub DoTheTimeConsumingTask      For example......      For Each bl As Block In theDocument.Blocks          ......do something      Next  End Sub codepre  pTo me, that all seemed far more logical. I surmised the Dispatcher would own the BackgroundWorker, which in turn would do all the long work, and everything would be on the UI thread. Well.so much for logical thinkingusually fatal with WPF....It doesnt. It crashes with the usual Different Thread error. So, what seemed on second thoughts to be a far more elegant solution, turned out to be a loserp  pMy questions then are as followsp  ol liIs my solution a solution, or notli liWhere am I going wrongli liHow can the solution be improved so that the Dispatcher is not tied up with the long task .which is exactly the situation I was trying to avoid li ol  pA further question. Please note that I had to use the FlowDocuments Dispatcher to make this work. If I used the System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher instead, then the Delegate sub DoTheTimeConsumingTask  does not get invoked so  to all intents and purposes  nothing happens. Can someone explain why not, please p  pI have not come to you as a first port of call. Ive tried dozens of options, and havent found anything yet that feels totally right apart from my second option that doesnt work LOL so Im asking for some guidance, please.p

Negative 1532 pSQL Server 2005 is used.p  pEach time a new data is received it is stored and a SP is called after that which uses this data to calculate some statistics data. Storing data and calling the SP is executed in a single transaction. The SP is enlisted in the transaction likep  precodeusing var transaction  session.BeginTransaction       ... executing insertupdate statements ...      var command  new SqlCommandStoredProcedureName, connection      command.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure     command.Parameters.Addnew SqlParametername, value      transaction.Enlistcommand     command.ExecuteNonQuery      transaction.Commit  codepre  pWhen running SQL Profiler I can see that all insertupdate statements are shown there only after calling codetransaction.Commitcode method but the SP call is shown immediately after calling codecommand.ExecuteNonQuerycode method. As a result the SP call is shown before insertupdate statements in SQL Profiler. It makes me think that the SP is actually executed before any insertupdate statements which is logically wrong.p  pThe question is why the SP call is shown in SQL Profiler after calling codecommand.ExecuteNonQuerycode method and not codetransaction.Commitcode one Does it mean that it is executed immediately and not after executing insertupdate statementsp

If I comment out the line that removes the indicator, it stays on the screen when everything is loaded. I am aware that Im probably messing around with which methods are called when in the process, and this is where I need help. p  pI should mention that the whole purpose is that instead of the users looking at a screen on which nothing is happening while the data loads, I want a activity indicator to show up to indicate that theres something going on here.p  pThanksp

Negative 1532 pWe were given external SOAP services that we have to consume in our project. All of these provide WSDL data, but a lot of them are not .NET services most of them were written in Java. We have generated a number of client proxies with wsdl.exe tool. This tool does what its supposed to do, it creates proxies for us to consume.p  pThe problem appears once we try to call methods on these services using generated proxies. We intercept all SOAP requests for logging purposes and XML data looks different from the one specified in WSDL schema. p  pFor instance, if a field is called Name, our proxies will serialize it as nameField. I guess this is because the property called Name uses a backing field called nameField. Services on the other side obviously cant interpret this kind of naming convention.p  pThis wouldnt be happening if our ASMX proxies used the old XmlSerializer, but for some reason they opt for DataContractSerializer, which completely messes up serialization and breaks compatibility between clients and services.p  pMy colleagues have resorted to manually constructing XML data and then sending it with HttpWebRequest class. I think this is completely unacceptable in 2011, this is what automated proxy generation is for.p  pMy question is why is this happening Why are our proxies using DataContractSerializer and thus ignoring all xml serialization attributes in the process Is there a way to force them to use XmlSerializer once againp  pWe use .NET 4.0.p

Negative 1532 pI have a mySql schema named Contacts that contains 4 tables Contacts, Phone, Email, and Addresses. The Contacts table contains basic information about a person such as an id number, first name, and last name. The other tables all contain a foreign key that links it to the Contacts table so for example, John Doe in the Contacts table can have multiple phone numbers in the Phones table that are all searchable by using John Does id number.p  pMy question is how do I query this schema and return all data for a single or multiple users. Can it be done with one SQL statement, or do I need to contact the database for each individual table based on the fact that the amount of results returned will not match for each row returned from the Contacts table.

How would I go about modifying this SQL statement and mapping functionality to search the contacts table, get the data for each row and then based on the id of each returned row, also query the phone, email, and address tables and then map those to a List object stored in the bean The problem is that row 1s id might find 8 phone numbers rows that match the id, but row 2s id might only find 3 phone numbers. How is this going to be stored in a ResultSet Or will I have to query the Contacts table first and then perform a separate query for each other table for each row returned from the first and add that data to the bean case by case If the first query returns 100 results, and I have to perform a query for each of those on 3 tables, I am looking at 301 trips to the database and back.p  pIs it possible to use one query and just return 1 result from each of the phone, email, address tables for each result found in the Contacts table Maybe I can add a primary column or something so it only returns 1 result and then if the user clicks something to request more information about the result it can perform the other queries and gather all the info about that user.p

Negative 1532 pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidemarketbillingbillingbestpractices.htmlSecurity and Designa guidelines go to great length outlining various methods to make it more difficult for an attacker to compromise inapp billing implementation.p  pEspecially noted is how easy it is to reverseengineer a code.apkcode file, even if obfuscated via Proguard. So they even recommend modifying all sample application code, especially known entry points and exit points.p  pWhat I find missing is any reference to the wrapping certain verification methods in a single method, like the static codeSecurity.verifycode which returns codebooleancode A good design practice reducing code duplication, reusable, easier to debug, selfdocumenting, etc. but all an attacker needs to do now is identify that method and make it always return codetruecode... So regardless how many times I used it, delayed or not delayed, randomly or not, it simply doesnt matter.p  pOn the other hand, Java doesnt have macros like in CC, which allows reducing source code duplication, but doesnt have a single exit point for a codeverifycode function.p  pSo my questions p  pIs there an inherent contention between the well known software engineeringcoding practices and design for so called security in the context of JavaAndroidsecure transactions at leastp  pWhat can be done to mitigate the sideeffects of design for security which seems like shooting oneself in the foot in terms of overcomplicating software that could have been simpler, more maintainable and easier to debugp  pCan you recommend good sources for further studying this subjectp

Ive not yet tested this code, and with something tricky like this Im looking for some expert advice before I continue down this path.p  pSomeone will ask Why are you doing this. Im working in a framework where there are other threads that callback into my code, and I dont have references to them. Periodically I want to update the value in a ThreadLocal variable they use, so performing that update requires that the thread which uses the variable do the updating. I just need a way to notify all these threads that their ThreadLocal variable is stale.p  hr  pIm flattered that there is new criticism recently regarding this three year old question, though I feel the tone of it is a little less than professional. The solution I provided has worked without incident in production during that time. However, there are bound to be better ways to achieve the goal that prompted this question, and I invite the critics to supply an answer that is clearly better. To that end, I will try to be more clear about the problem I was trying to solve.p  pAs I mentioned earlier, I was using a framework where multiple threads are using my code, outside my control. That framework was QuickFIXJ, and I was implementing the a hrefhttpwww.quickfixj.orgquickfixjjavadoc1.5.3quickfixApplication.html relnofollow titleApplication interfaceApplication interfacea. That interface defines hooks for handling FIX messages, and in my usage the framework was configured to be multithreaded, so that each FIX connection to the application could be handled simultaneously.p  pHowever, the QuickFIXJ framework only uses a single instance of my implementation of that interface for all the threads. Im not in control of how the threads get started, and each is servicing a different connection with different configuration details and other state. It was natural to let some of that state, which is frequently accessed but seldom updated, live in various codeThreadLocalcodes that load their initial value once the framework has started the thread.p  pElsewhere in the organization, we had library code to allow us to register for callbacks for notification of configuration details that change at runtime. I wanted to register for that callback, and when I received it, I wanted to let all the threads know that its time to reload the values of those codeThreadLocalcodes, as they may have changed. That callback comes from a thread I dont control, just like the QuickFIXJ threads.p  pMy solution below uses codeThreadLocalFlagcode a wrapped codeThreadLocalltAtomicBooleangtcode solely to signal the other threads that it may be time to update their values. The callback calls codesetAlltruecode, and the QuickFIXJ threads call codesetfalsecode when they begin their update. I have downplayed the concurrency issues of the codeArrayListcode because the only time the list is added to is during startup, and my use case was smaller than the default size of the list.p  pI imagine the same task could be done with other interthread communication techniques, but for what its doing, this seemed more practical. I welcome other solutions.p

If there is an exception, I want it to load the asp mvc Error view as a full page view.  However, with the code below, an exception causes the Error view to load as partial view in said div element.  I must be leaving something out of my controller...p  precode[HttpPost] [HandleError] public ActionResult LoadUnmappedProjects      bool error  false     try              throw new ArgumentException          catch Exception e              error  true           if error         using var db  new prismEntities                      return PartialViewdb.dmPSPProjectStatewideRegionals.ToList              else              return ViewError          codepre  pIdeasp  pstrongORIGINAL POSTstrongp  pIn an ASP MVC3 web app, I have an ajax call to and [HttpPost] action method.

Instead, an error gets returned to the Ajax call, and currently Im just popping up an alert.

Negative 1532 pI have a Java system that consumes an API. A few days ago, we started facing the following problem the remote API was receiving too many requests from my system. Back in the systems early days, it was not a major concern, but little by little the systems performance was getting worse and worse, since my data was growing and I made multiple requests for each entity. I noticed many of the network requests I made were not really necessary, since the data was not updated very frequently. So, I implemented a class that, when my system starts, makes an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1299374whatiseagerloadingovereager loadinga of all the remote API data. When I createupdate an entity, I load it before any request is made. I treat deletion accordingly. And the remote API also notifies me when any change is made so I can stay updated even when this change is made outside my system.p  pWhat I really want to know is is there any name for this practice Any known design pattern   I must say Ive done a little research and I think it is a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiProxypattern relnofollowproxy patterna but, again, Im not very sure in fact, most of the design patterns look very similar, and Im not really that much into design patterns.p

Negative 1532 pSo this is the umteenth revenge of the how do I get 3rd party cookies to work in Safari question but Im asking again because I think the playing field has changed, perhaps after February 2012. One of the standard tricks to get 3rd party cookies in Safari was as follows use some javascript to POST to a hidden iframe. It used to trick Safari into thinking that the user had interacted with the 3rd party content and so then allow cookies to be set.p  pI emthinkem this loophole has been closed in the wake of the mild scandal where it was revealed that Google was using that trick with its ads. At the very least, while using this trick I have been completely unable to set cookies in Safari. I unearthed some random internet postings that claimed that Apple was working on closing the loophole but I havent found any official word.p  pAs a fallback I even tried redesigning the main third party frame so that you had to click on a button before the content would load but even that level of direct interaction was not enough to melt Safaris cold cold heart.p  pSo does anyone know for certain if Safari has indeed closed this loophole If so, are there other workarounds other than manually including a session ID in every requestp

Negative 1532 pI inherited an ASP.NET application with an SQL Server backend that initially passed DataSets around a lot.

Negative 1532 pWe have some existing Java code running on a Tomcat server that we want to allow code on another machine to execute, so we are looking into web services.  I am new to web services and I think Im probably doing something wrong here.p  pI have followed a few online tutorials on how to deploy a JAXWS web service in Tomcat.  I have created a web service class and annotated it with WebService, written a web.xml and sunjaxws.xml file, packaged those files plus the JAXWS jar files into a .war file, and deployed it into Tomcat.  That appears to be working, as I can load the WSDL file in a browser pointed at Tomcat.p  pIts the web service client Im having trouble with.  First of all, there are existing classes on the server side that get mapped into a database.  We want to allow the client to use those same existing classes and create instances of out of them, invoke the web service, and then have the objects get stored into the database.  However, when I ran the wsimport command against the servers WSDL file, it generated a bunch of Java classes, a lot of which are similar to our existing classes.  I guess we have to use those instead of our existing classes  So much for code reuse, unless Im confused, which is very possible.p  pSo now Ive written the client using those classes that wsimport generated.  But Im getting compile errors.  Some of the fields in our existing Java classes are of type java.net.InetAddress.  But for some reason, wsimport generated its own InetAddress class, and this is what it looks likep  precodepackage ems.server.webservices import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessType import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAccessorType import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType XmlAccessorTypeXmlAccessType.FIELD XmlTypename  inetAddress public class InetAddress   codepre  pYeah its just a class with nothing in it  So a lot of the compile errors Im getting sayp  precodeWSClient.java37 setAddressems.server.webservices.InetAddress in ems.server.webservices.NetworkAddress cannot be applied to java.net.InetAddress     networkAddress.setAddressInetAddress.getByName1.1.1.1 codepre  pIm trying to create a java.net.InetAddress, but it wants me to use the empty class that was generated by wsimport.  I must be doing something wrong here.  Please enlighten me.p

Could there be a better way to animate a marker pin to a coordinate destinationp  pstrongUpdate 3strong as Jared pointed out I could try to animate codeRenderTransformcode, or use a transition to achieve my result. I had already gone this way and it doesnt seem to be my solution. This is what I found outp  ul liUsing codeRepositionThemeAnimationcode, it seems I have to give the new pixel position of the pin. This is problematic for a couple reasons first, I know the latlng destination of the pin, but would have to work out the projection as far as I can tell there is no public interface to work with projection. Secondly the projection itself can change as the map zoomspans. The pixel destination at the time of the end of the animation could not be the same as the initial pixel destination. In my scenario its a major problem as its very likely the map is moving while the animation is occurring.li liUsing codeRepositionThemeTransitioncode all the weird pixelprojection problems went away. Its the only way so far I was able to see the animation I expected. I just set the transition and set the new latlng position of the tag via MapLayer.SetPosition. It has two major problems though. I cant set the duration nor the easing functions for the animation. And most importantly I can see no way to execute code when the pin gets to its final position.li ul

Im trying to use Fiddler to see if my program is sending the proper data, but my program is throwing an AuthenticationException when trying to get a response from the site with Fiddler running. The requests are being sent over HTTPS and Fiddlers certificate is the cause of the excepting being thrown.p  pMy question is, what can I implement into my program to have it disregard the certificate authentication As far as my program goes, the requests and responses are being handled by HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse classes.p
Negative 1532 pI read about the implementation of the ForkJoin framework that was introduced in Java 7 and I just wanted to check that I understand how the magic works. p  pAs I understand, when a thread forks, it creates subtasks in its queue which other thread may or may not steal. When the thread attempts to join, it actually checks its queue for existing tasks and then recursively perform them, which mean that for any join operation  2 frames will be added into the thread call stack one for the join and one for the new taken task invocation.p  pAs  I know that the JVM does not support tail call optimization that may serve in this situation to remove the join method stack frame  I believe that while performing a complicated operation with a lot of forks and joins a thread may throw an codeStackOverflowErrorcode. p  pAm I right or did they find some cool way to prevent itp  pstrongEDITstrong p  pHere is a scenario to help clarifying the question Say for simplicity that we only have one thread in the forkjoin pool. At some point in time  the thread forks and then calls join. While in the join method the thread discovers that it can perform the forked task as it found in its queue so it invokes the next task. This task in turn forks and then call join  so while executing the join method the thread will find the forked task in its queue like before and invoke it. in that stage the call stack will contain at least the frames for two joins and two tasks.p  pas you can see the fork join framework transformed to plain recursion. Because java does not support tail call optimization  every recursion in java can cause codeStackOverflowErrorcode if it goes deep enough.p  pMy question is  did the implementer of the forkjoin framework find some cool way to prevent this situation.p

Negative 1532 pI have been using Linux env and recently migrated to solaris.

Negative 1532 pIm creating an app that runs a foreground service which counts the number of SMSes sent by the user. Basically, in the service, I have a codeContentObservercode to codecontentsmscode which filters calls to codeonChangecode if the message type has value code2code, meaning its a sent SMS. The message types are not part of the public API but here they are a hrefhttpgoo.gl5XTxe relnofollowhttpgoo.gl5XTxea. This is also how most of the answers here in StackOverflow suggest its done.p  pI can accurately count the number of sent SMSes when Im sending it to just one person, but when the number of recipients is two or more, the codeContentObservercode acts terribly weird. For some reason, Android makes several calls to my codeContentObservercodes codeonChangecode method with messages of type code2code even if technically, it should only send one SMS to one recipient once. Whats worse is, when I print to LogCat the messages for which codeonChangecode was invoked, strongit doesnt even show logs that the SMS was sent to the other recipients besides the first one, but it wasstrong.p  pThe link to my code is here a hrefhttppastie.org4555034 relnofollowhttppastie.org4555034a. Its pretty straightforward, roughly just 150 lines.p  pHow can I accurately  keep count of the SMS sent when I have more than one recipient My suspect is my condition for the codewhilecode at line 75, but I think Androids behavior is the bigger culprit here.p  pemstrongUPDATEemstrong for thatsmydoings question The count should be upped by 1 for 1 SMS to 1 recipient, by 2 if theres 1 SMS for 2 recipients, 3 if theres 1 SMS for 3 recipients, and so on lets assume the SMS is lt 160 characters for now. However, with my code above, even when there are 2, 3, or 4  recipients, the counter is incremented only by 1. I ran it on the emulator and figured out in LogCat that Android makes several type 2 calls to codeonChangecode for sending to only the first recipient, and no calls for the other recipients, even though testing it on a phone, it does in fact send and still produces the same logs. Moreover, it also calls codeonChangecode for the other messages I have sent before, not the one Im currently sending. Its really weird.p  pI have a feeling that my code might not be the problem, but that I might be misunderstanding how Android calls codeonChangecode on my codeContentObservercode for codecontentsmscode.p

Negative 1532 pHow do GUIs get built inside operating systems. Lets use two examples, say GTK in Ubuntu verses a Java JFrame. I thought that operating systems using some kind of graphical user interface would have to provide some system calls to be able to display windows. So for example, if I installed a version of Ubuntu on a machine, with out downloading any software I should be able to make a system call to display a window. It appears though that isnt the case. I have to install and download the SDK for GTK which allows me to create windows with buttons, etc. So then my question is with Java, how does Java then build its JFrames I understand that there is a Java Virtual Machine running ontop of the Linux system, but how does the Java virtual machine make calls to actually display the window Along with GUIs comes the events that the user interacts with them. At the Java level, the JVM handles all the lower level calls, and you get OnClick events etc. How does the JVM actually call and work with those calls Same with GDK I understand this is a broad question with many different answers, but any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1532 pI am new to Android programming. I am creating a very simple application in which I have more than 5 pictures which are static stored in drawable folder. Now, I have created an activity which is displaying all the pictures in gridView. Suppose, If I click on 2nd position image, it will open a new activity displaying that particular image in full size using ImageView mode plus next nextprevious button to navigate on the image It is not necessary that user can start only with first Image, heshe can select any image from the gridView and then navigation will start from that point itself. My problem is, I dont want to harcode the number of switch cases equal to number of images to navigate through the buttons. Is there any other way to implement the required scenario Or any other feature of Android that I can use to achieve the samep  pThanks in advance p  pI am adding my code also First Activity     pre public class GridViewActivity extends Activity p  precodeOverride public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activitygridview     GridView gridview  GridView findViewByIdR.id.gridView     gridview.setAdapternew ImageAdapterthis      gridview.setOnItemClickListenernew OnItemClickListener          public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View v, int position, long id               Create an Intent             Intent intent  new IntentgetApplicationContext, FullImageActivity.class             intent.putExtraimage, position             startActivityintent                codepre  p codep  pSecond Activity      public class FullImageActivity extends Activity implements OnClickListener p  Button button int drawable ImageView display  Override public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activityfullimage     Intent intent  getIntent     display  ImageView findViewByIdR.id.fullImageView      ImageView imageView  null      String idName  ivImage     int id     for int i  1 i lt 2 i          id  getResources.getIdentifieridName  i, id,                 getPackageName         imageView  ImageView findViewByIdid         imageView.setTagInteger i         imageView.setOnClickListenerthis         if i  1               make sure that your drawable has a value different than 0              otherwise a click on setWall button might result into a crash             drawable  id                   int pos  intent.getExtras.getIntimage     ImageAdapter imageAdapter  new ImageAdapterthis      imageView.setImageResourceimageAdapter.mThumbIds[pos]     Log.ipos,   pos      System.out.printlnpos   pos      button  Button findViewByIdR.id.btnNextScreen     button.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v              InputStream inputStream  getResources.openRawResource                     drawable             Bitmap bitmap  BitmapFactory.decodeStreaminputStream              try                  getApplicationContext.setWallpaperbitmap              catch IOException e                   use Log.e with all 3 params instead of                  e.printStackTrace                 Log.eMyTag, couldnt set wallpaper, e                               Override public void onClickView v       just to make sure that the clicked view is a ImageView     if v instanceof ImageView          ImageView imageView  ImageView v         int place  Integer imageView.getTag         int drawableId  getResources.getIdentifierimage  place,                 drawable, getPackageName         display.setImageResourcedrawableId         drawable  drawableId        codepre  p p  pI have added that code what WarrenFaith has suggested me.

Negative 1532 pI have an Event that works just fine when running in test mode, but does not fire when I run the code as a service. Before I post the code, let me give a bit of structure for the application, as I feel this is where the problem is stemming.p  pI have a tray app that is used to control a router service. When started, the service loads a dll library where all the processing takes place. When the library is started, it scans a directory for plugins, and hooks them into the main program. p  pWhen built as Release, the service is activated, and I have to install the application. As a side note, the tray app is run as administrator so it can control the service. When building as Debug, the tray starts the library dll directly, skipping the small service app that starts it. See the diagram belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comb6QMm.jpg altenter image description herep  pIn either case, the flow for this plugin is a Receiver receives a file, and notifies a Sender to forward it through an Event. The file is sent off for remote processing, and then returned to another Receiver, which forwards the results to the plugin through an Event. The plugin then processes the file, and should send back to the main program in an Event. When running in Debug no service, this is exactly what happens. When running as a service, all the Event handling works perfectly except for the plugin notifying the main program that the results were processed. There are no exceptions thrown, and I have confirmed through logging that the Event was hooked up correctly.p  pConnecting the Eventp  precode  Connect delegate to plugins that will add data to the database through the Router if plugin is INotify      INotifyplugin.NotifyProcessingComplete  new ProcessNotificationthis.OnProcessed     LogWriter.LogAssociated   plugin.Name   with OnProcessed, LogFile  codepre  pCalling the Event from the pluginp  precodeif NotifyProcessingComplete  null     NotifyProcessingCompleteExtractResultsargs.ReceivedFile else     LogWriter.LogNotifyProcessingComplete Delegate was null., LogFile codepre  pEvent Handlerp  precodepublic void OnProcessedProcessArgs args      LogWriter.LogOn Dicom Process was called..., LogFile     lock threadLock              if Settings  null          ...        codepre  pAccording to the logs, the plugin is hooked up correctly to OnProcessed, and logging in the ExtractResults method shows that it is returning correctly. However, NotifyProcessingComplete is not calling the OnProcessed method.p  pOnce again, this is only happening when running the code as a service.

Negative 1532 pIve been reading around, but I couldnt find a concrete answer to this. Im programming a 3d game that is going to require a more high level view of editing in terms of level design and scripting events. Not so much level design than being able to import characters and events ala more visual IDE game developing programs Unity, game maker, rpg maker. How would I go about achieving this I assume itll require a scripting integration, firstly, to allow real time editing, such as with Lua or C Ill be programming this in C mostly. And I also would like to know is this something that is designed separate from the main application. Aka, whatever you design in this editor, you can export it in a formal readable by the main game program.p

Heres the statement I madep  precodeSELECT shirts.shirtname, shirts.men AS mainphoto,         GROUPCONCATshirtsizes.sizename,shirtprices.price AS sizes FROM shirts  JOIN shirtslink ON shirtslink.shirtidshirts.id JOIN shirtsizes ON shirtsizes.idshirtslink.sizeid JOIN shirtprices ON shirtprices.idshirtslink.priceid WHERE shirts.men AND shirtslink.adulty GROUP BY shirts.id codepre  pBy doing this, are the size columns and price columns still two separate entities within that one column in the select statement  Another thing I noticed is the order of the sizes is all mixed up.  For example, this is a row from one of the columnsp  precodemedium29.22,large29.22,1xlarge29.22,2xlarge30.44,small29.22,3xlarge31.70 codepre  pwhy isnt it going from small3x like its organized on the table  I imagine in the event of what Im trying to do in terms of injecting it into we website through PHP if it were to auto load it would go in that unorganized manner as well.  How can I fix thisp  pMy ultimate goal here is to be able to create a selection that can auto populate each row into the javascript apps I created.  I need the load the shirt name, main picture, then each size and price into the divs I have coded for them.  Let me know if you need to see the actual tables being used.  Thanks in advance p

Negative 1532 pIm weighing up whether to roll my own authentication system a la the excellent a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes250authenticationfromscratchrevised relnofollowRailscasta or using Devise.p  pMy question is, what are the potential pitfalls when not using Devise but going for something as per the Railscast Are their security issues I need to think about that are not already covered in the cast Any other pitfalls you can think ofp  pEdit Why am I thinking about not using Devise Part of the reason I am shying away from Devise is because I am not keen on its failed logins protection. The way Devise does it means anyone can lock anyone elses account if they just know their email address. And it seems to me that on balance, I would be better off rolling my own than getting to know Devise inside out to make these changes, especially if I am going to need to do other things my own way too at some point in the future which seems likely.p

Negative 1532 pI have a fixed width text file that I need to parse.  Each line constitutes a record, with one or more fields occupying a fixed position in the line.  The way I have my program set up is that it parses each line using a parsing strategy depending on the record type the first 4 digits of the line determine the record type. The parsing strategy is a series of substrings that grab the fields I need, and place them into a Field object.  Each field object has a name e.g. Currency code and the data it contains.p  pThese Field objects are then placed into a Record object, which has a name and a list of fields.p  pI would like to figure out a way to determine if I have any overlength fields in a given record.  e.g. if the Country is supposed to be 5 characters long from column 4044 and they put in a 8 character string my program should be able to handle that.  p  pThis is the portion of the code that determines the behavior and executes itp  precodeString line   try       Will hold the current record count     line  in.readLine     for line  null line  in.readLine      Record rec  context.executeBehaviorline     transaction.insertrec   Insert the record into the current transaction      codepre  pThe executeBehavior line just executes the particular strategys parse method.p  pThis is the ParseBehavior interface, which classes implement if they want to parse stuffp  precodepublic interface ParseBehavior      public Record parseString line  codepre  pAnd heres an example Recordp  precodepublic class ParseRecord implements ParseBehavior      public Record parseString line          ArrayListltFieldgt recordSet  new ArrayListltFieldgt         String testFlag  line.substring11, 12         Field testFlagField  new FieldtestFlag, Test flag         recordSet.addtestFlagField          String location   line.substring90, 125         Field location  new Fieldlocation, Location         recordSet.addlocation          Record record  new RecordrecordSet         return Record       codepre  pI guess its not really a Java question per se, more of a design question.

There is a frame shown just as the lefthand ball leaves the row of balls. That exact frame is repeated a few frames later, when the lefthand ball is now on its way back to hit the row of balls again.

Negative 1532 pIve been trying to solve this problem for 3 days now and I simply cant find a solution.p  pSo, I have downloaded the Jrubycomplete1.7.3 jar. After which, I have attempted to install the gem nokogiri using the basic methodp  precodejava jar jrubycomplete1.7.3 S gem install nokogiri codepre  pIn addition, I have a separate jar which was created using the GemInAJar method. Note that this extra jar is only a result of trying to fix the problem below. p  pIn both cases, when I test it out via the irb, it shows me the followingp  precoderequire nokogiri gt true codepre  pNow, the problem arises when I try to use the jruby jar in an applet within my web application. To be specific, Ill mention that I can load the jar itself and interact with it from my applet, if I dont try to access any gem files specifically nokogiri in this case. However, to make this happen, I am required to sign the jar. p  pIf the jar is unsigned, it fails to work, as my Ruby instance fails to be created. When it is signed, it works fine. p  pThe issue is that once the jar is signed, I attempt to call the same command I did before, and I get the following errorp  precoderequire nokogiri  LoadError load error nokogirinokogiri  java.lang.RuntimeException  LoadError class nokogiri.EncodingHandlerINVOKDERs10gets signer information does not match signer information of other classes in the same package. codepre  pIve been searching around quite a bit in regards to the cause and potential solutions to this error, but I am unable to figure out why the gem itself is causing it. While using the GemInAJar method, I did use the same key to sign the gemjar.p  pUPDATE Turns out I was wrong. Each gem installed comes with its own jar file within the lib directory. These jars need to be signed with the same key. After doing so, the above issue was resolved. However, the one below remains.p  pAdditionally, when I attempt to run it in my webapplication, I get the following messagep  precodeclasspathMETAINFjruby.homelibrubysharedrubygems.rb396 warning  cant canonicalize loaded names due to security restrictions disabling codepre  pI assume this is the exception thrown when the error mentioned above occurs, but I cant say for sure. p  pI would sincerely appreciate anyone that can tell me what Ive done wrong, or provide suggestions on how to fix it.

Negative 1532 pSo this is quite interesting to me. Ive got the following example markupp  precodelta hreftest.htmlgt   lth2gtHello Worldlth2gt   ltdivgt     ltpgtHello againltpgt   ltdivgt ltagt codepre  pWhen I have my Google Chrome Version 26 rendering this, it shows me exactly this markup. But when I add an anchor inside the div like thisp  precodelta hreftest.htmlgt   lth2gtHello Worldlth2gt   ltdivgt     ltpgtHello againltpgt     lta hrefsomethingelsegtltagt   ltdivgt ltagt codepre  pThe browser outputs the followingp  precodelta hreftest.htmlgt   lth2gtHello Worldlth2gt   ltagt ltdivgt   lta hreftest.htmlgt     ltpgtHello againltpgt   ltagt   lta hrefsomethingelsegtltagt ltdivgt codepre  pSo this is absolutely not what I want. I can imagine it might makes sense in order to be able to click the inner link, that the anchors are only applied to some elements, but I would need it just how i wrote it there. It makes sense, because I have to copy the inner div to another position via JavaScript. But when I do that, the code is already messed up and shows the first link.p  pDoes anybody know how to deal with thisp  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 1532 pThis issue is so strange to me I dont even know how to explain it.  Let me start by saying everything is working fine locally.  The problem started when I published my app to a web server.  At first I was getting The model backing the DataContext context has changed since the database was created. Consider using Code First Migrations to update the database.  Strange because I didnt make any changes in my data model.  First thing I did was deleted the database then ran updatedatabase to create it again using code first migrations.  Tested locally worked fine then published deleting everything and got the same error.  I then set the initializer to null and removed the codeIncludeMetadataConventioncode.  Deleted db, updatedatabase, publish.  Now I am getting an error Invalid column name ItemID.  Ok that makes sense because I have no column ItemID in my database.  Running SQLProfile I can see that the sql generated locally is not including the column but when run on the server it does.  After hours screwing around looking for incorrect connection strings or any other little thing I may have missed, I decided to just copy my entire local folder manually to the web server.  Still same error.  I no longer know where to look and would like any ideas or suggestions.  Let me know if I can provide any code that may help.p  pI recently found that if I use codeCreateDatabaseIfNotExistsltDataContextgtcode and let the db get created on the server it will work from the server but not locally.p

The issue is that the Properties instance fails to load from the file no exceptions, no visible problems although it can store properly.p  pBecause I have a defaults HashMap, any property that doesnt exist has its default value placed in the Properties instance, which then stores everything, so that new properties are seamlessly added when the production server is updated.p  pIve been tracking this bug for hours, and I cant fix it. Ive read dozens of questions here on StackOverflow as well as code examples on other sites. Nothing helped.p  pThe one reason I havent dropped it already and used the DB instead is that the JDBC driver URL, user and password are stored in that file as well. Notice that the file is being read and written to the hard drive.p  pSince the defaults system puts stuff in place, even if the file doesnt exist when I try to read, after its saved it appears, but the next run still wont read anything. I noticed the bug after I changed a setting, and checked the file after a few runs, and to my shock, all values were default.p  pWhats currently happening is the following 1 No matter if the file is there or not, Properties will not load anything. 2 Since theres nothing in the Properties instance, it is filled with defaults. 3 The instance will now save, overwriting the file with the default values.p  pHeres all the relevant codep  precodeprivate static Properties getConfig     Properties properties  new Properties     File cfgFile  new Filedatatitallus.properties     try         ifcfgFile.createNewFile             System.out.printlnConfig file not found.

Negative 1532 pIve come across an interesting requirement for which I already have my own working implementation but am trying to make sure that Ive covered all the corner cases.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve would be best described as XPath condition delegation.p  pLets say that some obscure schema language makes it possible to constrain instance elements using arbitrary XPath conditions. These conditions are converted into Schematron assertions and are then applied to the XML instance document. In order for it to work, each condition needs a context node against which the expression is tested its like saying Find me a certain element in the XML instance document and then check if the XPath condition holds true against it. The thing is some conditions in my schema language may be defined for virtualabstract nodes, which never appear in instance documents xsdchoice might be a suitable analogy here  it exists only in the language file and not in instances. So I thought, ok, lets simply delegate the condition from parent vitrual node to child nodes, that actually appear in XML instances. And it worked out great If you only use absolute XPath location paths that is...p  pA hypothetical example of a schema languagep  precodeelement smth      element cenabled     choice c          assert cenabled  true lt context node is ltsmthgt, first instatiable ancestor gt         element one         element two          element foo  codepre  pThis basically says, allow codeltsmthgtcode elements, that have a codeltcenabledgtcode and a codeltfoogtcode child, and if codeltcenabledgtcode has a value of codetruecode also allow either a codeltonegtcode or a codelttwogtcode child. Example of a valid instance documentp  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltsmthgt     ltcenabledgttrueltcenabledgt     lttwogt     ltfoogt ltsmthgt codepre  pSo, as stated before, I decided to delegate the condition to codeltonegtcode and codelttwogtcode, essentially refactoring the above schema into the following at runtimep  precodeelement smth      element cenabled     choice c                      element one              assert cenabled  true lt context node is ltonegt, never satisfied since ltonegt has no ltcenabledgt child gt                  element two              assert cenabled  true lt context node is lttwogt, never satisfied since lttwogt has no ltcenabledgt child gt                   element foo  codepre  pThis would obviously work only, if the XPath conditions were written using absolute paths. Each time codeltonegtcode or codelttwogtcode are encountered in the instance document, the condition is checked by using them as the initial context node they are what codecurrentcode returns in XSLT.p  pSo after reading some a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxpath relnofollowXPath specificationa and creating an XPath parser using the wonderful a hrefhttpwww.antlr.orgwikidisplayANTLR4Home relnofollowANTLR4 toola combined with a hrefhttpblog.jwbroek.com201007antlrgrammarforparsingxpath10.html relnofollowthis grammara and implementing a transformation parse tree walker, Im now refactoring the original schema into thisp  precodeelement smth      element cenabled     choice c                      element one              assert ..cenabled  true lt uhuh, this is what were after gt                  element two              assert ..cenabled  true lt uhuh, this is what were after gt                   element foo  codepre  pNote that this in only a trivial example of the XPath conditions Im dealing with its not a matter of simply writing up a regex to handle it, since they are completely arbitrary, made up by whomever created the schema definition. The only thing I can be sure of about them is that they are valid XPath 1.0 expressions base functions only, no variables.p  hr  h2strongSo my question isstrong as per XPath 1.0 specification, what are the places in an XPath expression where constructs that refer to the initial context node in a relative way may appearh2  pMy current assumption is any a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxpathNTRelativeLocationPath relnofollowRelativeLocationPatha which does not have any of the following ancestors in the parse tree a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxpathNTAbsoluteLocationPath relnofollowAbsoluteLocationPatha and a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxpathpredicates relnofollowPredicatea. If RelativeLocationPath is preceded by an AbsoluteLocationPath, then the combination forms an absolute construct. Within a predicate all paths refer to a different context node or are absolute.p  pIm assuming this based on this graph I made represents how productions get called when parsing XPath with the grammar I refer to above img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJ12Qa.png altGrammar graphp  hr  pHere are some examples of the places I need to find within XPath expressions.

Negative 1532 pIm working on a system which bakes a complete set of .NET assemblies to native code at development time.  Ideally it would output machine language directly, but to spare myself the trouble of dealing with register colouring, different machine code for different target platforms, etc., I opted to make it output C code which is then compiled to ML using an existing compiler.p  pOne problem this introduces is that overflow checking on integer math operations cannot be performed efficiently in C code.  Certain CIL instructions  namely those with the code.ovfcode suffix, explicitly check for overflow.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions199333bestwaytodetectintegeroverflowinccAnother questionsa numerous answers propose various techniques for such checking in C but they all perform very poorly compared to the machine code a JIT compiler might output for instance, codejocode or codeintocode on Intel.p  pConsidering that the application is fairly performance critical, it would be highly tempting to just ignore the code.ovfcode on these instructions and emit the same C code as for the nonchecked variants.  This would of course break my CLI implementation strictly speaking per ECMA335, but Im wondering whether it would really be broken emin practiceem.p  pI am under the impression that these checks are mainly intended for program debugging.  In the context in which my CLI is being used, the program is already debugged, and it is not controlling nuclear warheads not real ones anyway.p  pThe system is to be used mainly on our own code, none of which depends on overflow checks for correctness.  According to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms18235428vVS.8029.aspx relnofollowthisa it would be bad form.  My concern is mainly for .NET class libraries we may link to and which my system will also of course have to process.p  pOut of all the code I foresee having to link to, my main concern is the BCL that comes with Mono.  Were considering using that BCL since its already readymade and liberally licensed.  However, when I do an IL dump of System.dll from Mono, I find it peppered with code.ovfcode instructions many of these are codeconv.ovfcode, which can be implemented in C as efficiently as in ML, but some are on arithmetic.p  pWould Monos BCL actually be depending upon any of these checks for correctness, or are they just sanity checks that can safely be ignored for code already deemed to be sane  I expect the latter, but thought Id ask in case others know better.p

Negative 1532 pI am new to databases and Im trying to decide which one would suit my needs the most.  I am in the planning stages of a program that will store directory references to thousands of PDF files at multiple locations all under one domain.  Basically, all it will be is date, location, originators name and link to the file in each of the fields within the database.  Nothing more no files, nothing fancy. All Ill need to do with the database is sort fields by location, date, name of the originator  thats it.  There will be instances where multiple writes would need to occur at the same time.  Ive read up on SQLite website that only one write is supported at any given time.  Does it mean writes to a specific file or database period p  pWhat I mean is that multiple records would need to be added from different clients at any given time, but the existing records would not need to be modified and if they do, it would be done from a specific client.  To give a little bit more detail, what Ill have is several locations at which service application will be running in the background and listening to folders.  Once a file enters a folder, it gets renamed under a specific format and added to the database.  It is very likely that two folder listening apps would try to add files to the database at the same time.p  pWould I be able to accomplish this with SQLite or is it one write at any given time to the entire database If only one write is possible, period, to the entire database, is there a way to implement some sort of spooling system sort of like on a printer, where writes would wait in a queue with life timers on themp  pIf its not possible, then I will look at MySQL. Cost is of a concern, so Im steering towards these two.p
Negative 1532 pI made a custom player using the JPlayer and I seem to have ran into an issue.

Negative 1532 pI have a question about implementing search functionality. I have a table which contains 2 user ids and details of transaction between them title, date, description, etc.. I want to allow user to search transactions by any of these criteria so typing Mike salary 2013 would result in transactions from 2013 with Mike, which title or description contained word salary.p  pThis can be accomplished by joining required tables, creating a search string and filtering every input word by that string, but what concerned me, was that Transaction table is designed to have ultimately millions of rows  so joining multiple tables  string operations from databases side could be slow.p  pMy another idea was to create separate column for search string  that string would be created with creation of transaction and would contain all necessary information. The problem is when user decides to change hisher name users can do that form their Profile page. The search strings in all transactions assigned to that user would be outdated.p  pSo heres my question is it better to search all entries and update search strings after user changes their name it would be costly, but users dont change their names often or give up on this whole search string column idea and do it with oldfashioned joins Or maybe there is another optionp  pThanks for your help p

Negative 1532 pI am refactoring a project to use Play Framework instead of Scalatra, and am running into trouble with query parameters containing semicolons, e.g. urlfilterfilter1val1filter2val2 gets mapped to filter  filter1val1filter2val2 in Scalatra, but gets mapped to filter  filter1val1 in Play Framework.  The only solution Ive found, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq119672901827903Escape semicolon route playframework 2.0.2a, suggests using a regex to capture the entire parameter, but this appears to only be applicable to path parameters and not to query parameters  one of my requirements is that I cant change the way that the front end calls the api, i.e. I cant change a query parameter into a path parameter.p  pHow can I tell Play not to parse out the semicolons in query parameters, i.e. to return filter1filter2 instead of filter1p  pI can manually parse out the query parameters using a regex on request.rawQueryString, but Id rather avoid this if possible.p
Negative 1532 pI know that branches in GPU programs shaders, CUDA, CL, ... behave different performancewise than branches in CPU programs. Typically, instances of a shader are grouped and instances from the same group compute the same path.

Negative 1532 pOK. So here is the problem Im having. Im trying to design an app that acts as a simple task reminder. I have successfully created a database with 4 columns Name, Date, Priority and whether the task has been completed or not, the first 3 being text, the last an integer. Name is the primary key.p  pName and date are entered via text boxes Ill add a calendar soon enough. Priority is input via a radio group. Now I havent added any checks for Name not being present in the database already, so the app crashes when I input the same name, which is ok for now.p  pHere is my issue Whenever I select a radio button in the radio group to set a priority to the same as a task that has already been entered before irrespective of when it has been entered, the row which has an identical value for the task is now replaced. No errors, nothing. And if, based on the selected radio button, I change the text stored into the table along with that particular task, the same thing happens. What I mean is this Initially, on selecting radio button with priority high, I stored a 2 as text. Medium was 1, low was 0. So, I could have only 3 rows in the table each having the latest task input by the user which has 2, 1 and 0 respectively in the last column. Thinking it was the numbers that caused the problem, I replaced them with HIGH, MEDIUM , LOW respectively. But now, I can have a max of 6 rows with the value of the last column being 0,1,2,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW.p  pTo clarify, heres a runtime examplebr Name abr Date 12122012br PR   HIGH  p  pIn tablebr a      12122012      HIGH  p  pName bbr Date 12122012br PR LOW  p  pIn table a      12122012      HIGHbr b      12122012      LOW  p  pName cbr Date 10102010br PR HIGH  p  pIn tablebr c      10102010      HIGHbr b      12122012      LOW  p  pSo, the same value in date doesnt cause an issue, only in priority.p  pHere is the code for the class which handles the SQL part p  precodeimport android.content.Context import android.database.Cursor import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper  public class SQLManager extends SQLiteOpenHelper       private static SQLManager sqlObj  null     String currUser  null      private SQLManagerContext context          supercontext, StoreConst.DBNAME, null, StoreConst.DATABASEVERSION           TODO Autogenerated constructor stub            public static SQLManager createObjectContext context  Singleton pattern               if sqlObj  null             sqlObj  new SQLManagercontext          return sqlObj            Override     public void onCreateSQLiteDatabase db           TODO Autogenerated method stub         db.execSQLStoreConst.CREATETABLE           Override     public void onUpgradeSQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion           TODO Autogenerated method stub          Lite no upgradation of Tables needed in this project           public void newTaskString tName, String tDate, String tPr          SQLiteDatabase db  this.getWritableDatabase          Inserting Row         db.execSQLINSERT INTO   StoreConst.TABLENAME                    StoreConst.NAME  ,   StoreConst.DATE  ,                   StoreConst.PR  ,   StoreConst.STATUS    VALUES                   tName  ,   tDate  ,   tPr  , 0         db.close            public Cursor getTaskByNameint status           SQLiteDatabase db  this.getReadableDatabase                    Cursor cursor  db.queryStoreConst.TABLENAME, null,           StoreConst.STATUS     status, null, StoreConst.NAME, null,            StoreConst.NAME ASC                   Cursor cursor  db.rawQuerySELECT  FROM   StoreConst.TABLENAME,                 null            WHERE   StoreConst.STATUS     status            ORDER BY            StoreConst.NAME   ASC, null         return cursor           public Cursor getTaskByDateint status           SQLiteDatabase db  this.getReadableDatabase         Cursor cursor  db.queryStoreConst.TABLENAME, null, StoreConst.STATUS                     status, null, StoreConst.DATE, null,                   StoreConst.DATE   DESC         return cursor           public Cursor getTaskByPrint status           SQLiteDatabase db  this.getReadableDatabase         Cursor cursor  db.queryStoreConst.TABLENAME, null, StoreConst.STATUS                     status, null, StoreConst.PR, null,   StoreConst.PR                   DESC          return cursor           public void clearDataBase          SQLiteDatabase db  this.getWritableDatabase         db.execSQLDELETE FROM   StoreConst.TABLENAME        codepre  pNote that the getTaskByNameDatePr functions above are used to access the database.

The  itself dissapears once the post has been made, leaving only the hyperlinked text i.e. codeMichael Jacksoncode.p  pProgramatically compiling a post via the api, including the , results in the text being posted in plain text. i.e. codeMichael Jacksoncode shows as codeMichael Jacksoncode.p  pHow can I escape, or otherwise parse the anchor through the api so that Facebook recognises it as a link to another userpagep  pEdit I found a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsopengraphguidestagging relnofollowthis referencea which describes these links as Actions, specifically in this case a Mentioning friends action.

Negative 1532 pDont know if it is possible, but Ill try to explain the best I can.  I have come across some code where an out of the box WSDL and XSD were being modified, primarily to have a custom XSD with the codelttypesgtcode stripped out and placed in their own XSD instead of living in codelttypesgtcode.  Small changes were made to some of the classes to change inputoutput object types for some reason.p  pIn the future if there are any updates to the WSDL, someone will have to go in by hand and remod the XSD to match our needs, plus have the new items from the updated WSDL version.p  pAfter hunting around on SO it seems that you can import multiple schemas into a WSDLs codelttypesgtcode definition.  I was wondering the order in which those XSDs load, is it related to their ordering in the codelttypesgtcode  Is it possible to override classes that would be common between both XSDs the original, and the modded onep  pBasically I want to pull out the modded changes and put them in their own, very lightweight, XSD to reduce the footprint.

Negative 1532 pIm trying to create an algorithm to test if an anagram created by another algorithm from an original word is too close to the original word or not. The context is an anagram solving game  I want the game to generate anagrams on the fly from words I have put into the game, but want to avoid them being too easy to solve due to the randomness leaving similarities with the original word e.g. an anagram for BATMAN being BTAMAN.p  pI am an amateur, so I wanted to see if my ideas were on the right track. My current plan is based on assigning points to certain criteria, then adding up the points and checking if a certain threshold is reached meaning the anagram is too similar to the original word and should be discarded.p  pNote Ive tried some 3rd party code for checking the similarity of two strings, but they seem to be heavily weighted to the string length and actual characters, which will be the same in my anagramoriginal word pairsp  pI also want to avoid gaming the anagrams too much and creating false randomness e.g. never having an anagram with the same starting letter as the original word.p  pHeres my algorithm in pseudocode anagrams in my game range from short words to twoorthree word strings, such as a movie titlep  precodeFunction IsAnagramTooSimilarToOriginalWordoriginal, anagram as Boolean count  0 if original word 1st letter  anagram 1st letter then count 1 if original word last letter  anagram last letter then count 1 if any 3letter substring from original word exists in anagram then count 2 for each occurence if count gt5 then return True else return False codepre  pAnd so on. I can hone the specific checks depending on the results.p  pIm not asking for any code...just wondering if anyone has done anything similar before andor if Im making any algorithm noob mistakes. Or am I overthinking itp  pI create the anagrams themselves via a simple algorithm to take a random char from the string and add it to a new string until there are none left in the original. The new algorithm would be used to check the result and if required redo the anagram.p

Negative 1532 pIm building SDL2 static library. To use it in my program, I have to link with static SDL2.lib, but also with winmm.lib, imm32.lib, version.lib, which I assume are stubs for some Windows DLLs. My main goal is to create such a version of static SDL2, so that my program wont have to be linked with those other 3 .libs. I would like to have all the symbols needed in the static library, so that I have to link the exe only with SDL2.lib. Im using MS VS2012. I had the idea to use the Librarian when building the static SDL2.lib so I added those other 3 libs to LibrarianAdditional Dependencies. That worked like a charm. My exe has to be linked only against SDL2.lib.p  pBut when the .lib was linked, I got warningsp  precodewarning LNK4221 This object file does not define any previously undefined public symbols, so it will not be used by any link operation that consumes this library  imm32.libIMM32.dll    SDL2main warning LNK4221 This object file does not define any previously undefined public symbols, so it will not be used by any link operation that consumes this library  version.libVERSION.dll    SDL2main codepre  pNow my idea is this imm32.lib and version.lib do not define any previously undefined in SDL2.lib symbols. So they are not needed, because all of the symbols in SDL2.lib can be resolved. So I removed those 2 libs from the Librarian and recompiled SDL2.lib. Now when Im linking my exe against it, I got some unresolved symbols possibly from those 2 removed .libs. p  pCould somebody explain to me the meaning of those warnings And how to avoid themp

Negative 1532 pI guess its such an easy question Im coming from Java, but I cant figure out how it works.p  pI simply want to increment an vector element by one. The reason for this is, that I want to compute a histogram out of image values. But whatever I try I just can accomplish to assign a value to the vector. But not to increment it by onep  pThis is my histogram functionp  precodevoid histogramunsigned char image, int height,         int width, vectorltunsigned chargtamp histogramArray       for int i  0 i lt width i          for int j  0 j lt height j              histogramArray[1]  inthistogramArray[1]  int1  add histogram position by one if greylevel occured             histogramArray[intimage[i][j]]                display output     for int i  0 i lt 256 i          cout ltlt Position  ltlt i ltlt endl         cout ltlt Histogram Value  ltlt inthistogramArray[i] ltlt endl       codepre  pBut whatever I try to add one to the histogramArray position, it leads to just 0 in the output. Im only allowed to assign concrete values likep  precodehistogramArray[1]  2 codepre  pIs there any simple and easy way I though iterators are hopefully not necesarry at this point, because I know the exakt index position where I want to increment something.p  pEDIT Im so sorry, I should have been more precise with my question, thank you for your help so far The code above is working, but it shows a different mean value out of the histogram difference of around 90 than it should. Also the histogram values are way different than in a graphic program  even though the image values are exactly the same Thats why I investigated the function and found out if I set the histogram to zeros and then just try to increase one element, nothing happens This is the commented code abovep  precodefor int i  0 i lt width i              for int j  0 j lt height j                  histogramArray[1]      add histogram position by one if greylevel occured                  histogramArray[intimage[i][j]]                       codepre  pSo the position 1 remains 0, instead of having the value heightwidth. Because of this, I think the correct calculation histogramArray[image[i][j]] is also not working properly.p  pDo you have any explanation for this This was my main question, Im sorry.p  pJust for completeness, this is my mean function for the histogramp  precodeunsigned char meanHistogramvectorltunsigned chargtamp histogram      int allOccurences  0     int allValues  0     for int i  0 i lt 256 i          allOccurences  histogram[i]  i         allValues  histogram[i]          return allOccurences  float allValues  0.5f  codepre  pAnd I initialize the image like thisp  precodeunsigned char image new unsigned char[width] for int i  0 i lt width i  image[i]  new unsigned char[height]  codepre  pBut there shouldnt be any problem with the initialization code, since all other computations work perfectly and I am able to manipulate and safe the original image. But its true, that I should change width and height  since I had only square images it didnt matter so far. The Histogram is created like this and then the function is called like thatp  precodevectorltunsigned chargt histogramArray256 histogramarray, adaptedHeight, adaptedWidth, histogramArray codepre  pSo do you have any clue why this part histogramArray[1] dont increases my histogram  histogramArray[1] remains 0 all the time histogramArray[1]  2 is working perfectly. Also histogramArray[intimage[i][j]] seems to calculate something, but as I said, I think its wrongly calculating. I appreciate any help very much The reason why I used a 2D Array is simply because it is asked for. I like the 1D version also much more, because its way simplerp
Negative 1532 pThe situationp  pWe migrated to new workstations. I copied all of my workspaces over. On the old workstation, I had both RAD 7.5 based on Eclipse 3.4 and Eclipse 4.3. On the new workstation, I have only RAD 8.5 based on Eclipse 3.6. So far, the only problem Ive had has been when I opened an Eclipse 4.3 workspace in RAD 8.5 and I discovered that Content Assist simply doesnt work. I can type codethis.code and wait, and then nothing happens for a few seconds, and then the little red underline appears under the text. I can hit kbdCtrlkbdkbdSpacekbd and the contentassist window appears  and its ememptyemp  pWhats interesting is that the legacyRAD 7.5 workspaces emdontem have this problem  it only happens with the workspaces that were created with Eclipse 4.3. Ive tried using the Restore Defaults button in the Preferences page, Ive tried exporting preferences from my legacyRAD 7.5 workspaces and importing to my legacyEclipse 4.3 workspaces, but content assist still doesnt work.p  pIm guessing that theres some piece of metadata that needs to be recreated by RAD 8.5 but Im not sure which one that is... Does anyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 1532 pHere is what Id like to do  Id like to have a bluetooth dongle with a button that when pressed, takes my phone out of whatever state it is in and starts google voice search. That is, if the phone is off screen off it will turn on assume no PINpattern lock. Then, it will start google voice search just as if I was to pronounce OK google. The way I was thinking of solving this was to have the BT dongle show up as either BT keyboard or BT hands free, and send the right code to the Android phone to trigger the operation. I could not, however, find such code. The next tier solution is to have some listener app running in the background, listening the BT keyboard codes, and triggering google search via some intent. Any comments to put me on the right track here Thanks.p

Negative 1532 pA clojure newbie question. I am trying to figure out the best way to pass a date from a client written in any language to a server written in clojure that rests on a Datomic database. To avoid any problems with language specific classes I was planning to pass the date as a RFC3339 formatted string. However, Im having trouble parsing the string in Clojure. My, apparently erroneous, assumption was that I could dop  precodeclojure.instantparsetimestamp 2014 codepre  pand thus get an instant. However, this call results inp  precodeclojure.lang.ArityException Wrong number of args 1 passed to instantfn6183fn  codepre  pThis confuses me greatly since as far as I can see this function only takes a single argument formatted string. p  pWhat have I missedp

Negative 1532 pIm working on a custom number pad and am having an issue with the background image of the UIButtons.  Everything appears to work as it should but occasionally during push animations the buttons flicker white in between each other.  This most often happens when popping a view controller to a view with the numberpad.  When I change the background color of their enclosing view to something radical like green then the flicker is green, so it seems like somehow the background is showing through.

One is double tap straight from the app and the other is a double tap when not in the app.  Its interesting that both yield a different result.  These results have been constant so far every time I try it.  So imagine a push animation with the whole number pad switching between all three states of the screenshots and thats pretty much what we are seeing.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxfAu5.png altenter image description hereimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdFT3q.png altenter image description herep  pThings Ive thought of  tried in order of relevancyp  ul lipSome sort of problem with the image like transparency  There is no transparency in the images and multiple sizes or difference images alltogether all cause the same issue.  The resizable image doesnt affect things either.  There is one caveat and that is solid images created in code or provided as a png dont cause a problem.pli lipLayout problem  I dont think so.  Ive written this with both autolayout and overriding layoutSubviews and its the same.  Ive checked the frames after the view appears and all the views are stacked next to each other as they should be.pli lipRetina vs non retina problem  I dont have a not retina device and cant test this.  Xcode 5.1 only gives me a iOS6 non retina simulator and I havent been able to reproduce on iOS6.pli lipSetting the background color to match the orange of the buttons.  Didnt work, things still flashed. pli lipImplement a custom iOS7 screenshot for when the app is backgrounded.  This wouldnt solve the issues when doing pushes from our nav controller.pli ul  pIm at a loss of whats going wrong or how to fix this issue.  Its possible that there is a known bug but I havent seen anything yet.  Does anyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 1532 pFollowing a c tutorial and teaching about codefindcode the following code was implemented to search for all the cat occurrences in a codestringcodep  precodestdstring input stdsizet i  0, xappearances  0 stdgetlinestdcin,input    fori  input.findcat,0 i  stdstringnpos iinput.findcat, i      xappearances     i Move past the last discovered instance to avoid finding the same string  codepre  pThen the tutorial challenges the apprentice to change codefindcode for coderfindcode, and thats where the problems came in, first I tried what seemed to be the obvious approachp  precodefori  input.rfindcat,input.length i  stdstringnpos iinput.rfindcat, i      xappearances     i Move past the last discovered instance to avoid finding the same string  codepre  pbut with this solution I fell into an infinite loop. Then I discovered that it was happening because the increment is performed before the condition check, and that the increment coderfindcode was always finding a match even with codeistdstringnposcode if the match is on the beginning of the string, for example cats. My final solution came to bep  precodeint ninput.length fori  input.rfindcat,input.length ngt0 ampamp istdstringnpos iinput.rfindcat, i      xappearances     ni     i Move past the last discovered instance to avoid finding the same string  codepre  pWith codencode I can keep the track of the position in the codestringcode, and with it exit the codefor loopcode when the entire codestringcode had been searched.p  pSo my question is Is my approach correct Did I need an extra variable or is there any other simpler way of doing thisp
Negative 1532 pI work on a project under an AWS IAM role the default Adminlevel permissions. I recently started an EC2 instance of a custom AMI and ensured everything was running correctly.

Negative 1532 pI am using a function module to communicate from ABAP to a device connected on the serial port. It is based on the MSCOMM ActiveX Control and uses the MSCOMM properties to readwrite values. Unfortunately, I need to send hex strings to the device because of the communication protocol. I am unable to do that. When I try to send a string of hex values, it is sending the ASCII values of the hex values on the serial port.p  pFor example, I want to send the following hex values on the serial port 01 24 56. I created an XSTRING in ABAP and has the value 012456, which is ok, but the serial port receives the following hex values 30 31 32 34 35 36, which are the converted ASCII values for the components of the string sent from ABAP.p  pI saw that in VisualBasic, for example, to the string can be applied a cast to hex before sending it.p  pCan anybody tell me if it is possible to send hex strings through the serial port from this function module based on MSCOMM in ABAP without using a thirdparty softwarep  pThanks in advance, S.p

Negative 1532 pI have set of pre executed files and they are not with a known extensions like code.txtcode or code.csvcode or code.datcode. They have extensions from the process names like time0.1 time0.01 ans so on. When i am trying to read them and plot specific column against log of 10 power. I can plot the graph when I copy the content of the file to a new file and extension .txt but I have like 100 such files and want to read them all together and plot them on one canvas only. I get error as file not found. I cannot copy paste every file into a new file when I have to plot them. Is it possible have simple way where I can load the txt in which ever format it is and pick a particular column to plot. I also tried using codeusecols0,1code with codenumpy.loadtxtcode but everytime it shows codefile not found errorcode. I did search for the error and everywhere what suggestions I see I make the necessary changes but still its the same error.   p  pCodep  precodeimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from pylab import import math from matplotlib.ticker import LogLocator  for fname in threshold0.1time10, threshold0.01time10, threshold0.001time10, threshold0.0001time10, threshold0time10     data  np.loadtxtfname     Xdata[0,]     Ydata[,2]     plt.plotY,ro plt.gca.setxscalelog plt.show  codepre  pInputp  precode1 18683 0.0457805581489 2 3519 0.00862290767681 3 101048 0.247606585657 4 284849 0.697989948517 codepre  pEvery input file has these three columns and I am interested in only codecol[2]codep  pErrorp  precodeFile readformat.py, line 9, in ltmodulegt     data  np.loadtxtfname, usecols0,1,2   File usrlibpython2.7distpackagesnumpylibnpyio.py, line 690, in loadtxt     fh  iteropenfname, U IOError [Errno 2] No such file or directory threshold0time10 codepre

Negative 1532 pI am creating and formatting an XLS Workbook from an Access Database using VBA, initiated via a user button press on a form.p  pId like to have the XLS App ALWAYS open on top of the AccessDB to permit the user to see the worksheet directly.  Currently it is intermittent, XLS usually opens UNDER Access on first iteration, but then ontop in subsequent iterations in the same session.  User review of the file is necessary prior to final save and export to our client portal.  There will typically only be a single iteration per user session.p  pI am using the following approach pseudop  precodeDim appXLS As Object Dim wbkNew As Object Dim wks1, wks2, wks3 As Object  Set appXLS  CreateObjectExcel.Application Set wbkNew  appXLS.Workbooks.Add  appXLS.Visible  True wbkNew.Activate  ...populate amp format 3 worksheets from Access  wks1.Activate   go back to sheet 1 wbkNew.SaveAs AccessModexlExclusive, FileNamemyFile codepre  pI am saving the file in this routine, so any overwrite file warnings also open under MSAccess.p  pI thought the .Activate lines would ensure the desired function.

Negative 1532 pIm just starting to get to grips with angular and I am trying to do something that I think should be pretty simple, but I cant find anyone who has posted with exactly the same scenario.  I have a collection which is initiated with three objects and I am using ngrepeat to generate a set of input fields for each of these objects. When the SPA is initialised I want the first input field to have focus I can do with with autofocus if necessary.  When the user TABs off the last input field I add another object to the collection using ngbluraddRecordindex. When the DOM is refreshed I want the first field in the new object to have focus.  The difference between my effort and all the examples I can find online is that all the examples initiate the addition using a button and an ngclick event.p  pBecause the DOM element is going to be created on the fly, I think I need a custom directive with a timeout but this seems like a lot of work for what should be a fairly standard requirement.  I am using 1.3.x Can anyone show me the basics of how to write the directive or point me at a library that already exists that will do what I want.

Negative 1532 pI wanted to save battery life time. My app only needs to be drawn sometimes. So I added this code to my Renderer in the onDraw methodp  precodeboolean dirty  true  public void onDrawFrameGL10 arg0      if dirty return     dirty  false      ..... draw images ....  codepre  pSo my app only gets drawn when I want it. But what happens is that if I dont draw my app on every frame it flickers really fast. It looks like it will be drawn every 2. frame or so and in all the other frames only a black screen will be drawn.p  pI know that i could set the render mode to codeRENDERMODEWHENDIRTYcode. But I dont want to create another thread to check if its dirty or not.p  pMy question is why does it flicker i dont call any methods or GLES20 calls before i do my check codeif dirty returncode and i am sure that the codeboolean dirtycode doesnt change and is always false except for the first frame.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI changed my code to thisp  precodeint dirty  0  public void onDrawFrameGL10 arg0      if dirty gt 1 return     dirty      ..... draw images ....  codepre  pThis stops the flickering Looks like you have to draw atleast 2 times so you dont have this wierd screen flickering. Anyways I will now try to use the more clean way and create a thread that calls coderequestRendercode when i want to draw something and set my render mode to codeRENDERMODEWHENDIRTYcodep

Negative 1532 phey guys I have an assignment in programming in c which says p  p  Write a C program that inputs a list of integer test scores between 0 and 100, and computes the maximum score, the minimum score, and the average score. Use 1, as a sentinel, to mark the end of the input. Reject any test score outside the range 0 to 100. Your program should also detect and reject faulty input, such as letters and characters. You should have a function that reads and validates an input test score and rejects invalid and faulty input. Here is a sample run p  pI wrote a code but my problem is how to reject input like characters ..p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt define sentinel 1      to end the program  int main       int status, score, sum, i, max, min     double avrg     i  0           the counter      sum  0             the total scores     printf  Enter the score , d to termenate gt , sentinel     status  scanf d, ampscore   checking the validity of the input      max  score         the initial maximum     min  score         the initial minimum      while score  sentinel           while score lt 0  score gt 100     no negative or more than 100 score                       printf The number is out of the range  try againgt              scanf d, ampscore                   sum  sum  score         i  i  1         printf  Enter the score , d to termenate gt , sentinel         status  scanf d, ampscore         if score gt max ampamp score lt 100             max  score         if score lt min ampamp score gt 0             min  score           if i  0          avrg  double sum  i     the sum of scores over the number of scores         printf  The avarage is  n .2f , avrg         printf n         printf  Maximum score is  n d, max         printf n         printf Minmum score is  n d, min      else           when the user ends the program without entering any value              printf You didnt enter any score           return 0  codepre  pI hope you can help me p

Negative 1532 pI have been researching this a while,  but nothing. My codeArrayAdapterltgtcode for my codeGridViewcode is in a codeFragmentcode tab. I have concluded that because it is in a fragment, that when I browse tabs then go back to my photos tab, instead of reuploading images from scratch, it instead uploads images and add the same ones to the adapter. This results in 2 sets of identical images, but what I need is only a single set to upload upon revisiting the tab.p  pI tried putting codeadapter.clearcode followed by codeadapter.notifyDataSetChangedcode into my codeonPausecode fragment lifecycle method. So when the fragment is not visible anymore, all adapter items clear, and when the fragment is visible again, it loads a fresh copy of images from my SD card. But this is not working, it still adds the new set of images in addition to the previously loaded set. Anyone know how to get the adapter cleared so I dont get the same images added every time I revisit the tab Or if there is another way to do it, that Im not aware of ... Thanks in advance.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks to everyone for the contributions, I finally found a work around that helped. I logged all of my codeadaptercode variables at different stages, and found that no matter where I clear it, it will always post a duplicate set in the codeloadSDCardcode method, so it must have been coming from there. So I just made a condition on my adapter to prevent it from loading again. I noticed that my adapter was already loaded after coming back from the other tabs, by using codegetCountcode on it. This came from my codePhotoTab.javacode and is the missing piecep  precodeif adapter.getCount  0              adapter.addAllloadSDCard               add the default icons remaining, to GridView, if

Negative 1532 pI am having some issues with a third level nested viewroute using uirouter. I am essentially developing a site admin panel for all the sites I manage. on the tools page you first have to select an environment which populates the sites view and dropdown box once a site is selected you should get the selected view and panel which will contain all the site specific info. The issue I am having is the selected panel shows up when the sites panel shows up without having selected a site yet. p  pMy real question is this what is the proper way to setup multiple nested views using uirouter do all the view get specified under each state also is it ok to change the URL with a view change or should the url only be altered during a state change. I think I am mixing up states and views. I know that what I really want is a tools statepage with multiple views one for each set of options.p  peven if someone could just provide some links to good tutorials on nested views and routes using uirouter that would be awesome.p  pI will try to setup a plunker to demonstrate what I am trying to do, but it has proved difficult so far being that I started with ngboilerplate for this projectp

Negative 1532 pIm using babeljs with es7 style asyncawait methods.  I have a main script that will call a async method on an array of objects that all return promises.  I use Promise.all to wait for all of those to return, however, these tasks could take a long time and if they exceed a threshold I would like to abort all of them, and the task handle that in an appropriate way.p  pIs there anyway to accomplish such a thing  Currently the only way that I can think of is by spawning a process that does the work of calling these methods and waiting for them to all resolve, and if the time limit is reach, it can kill the process and do whatever handling it needs.p  pUpdate  Some clarification about these methods that the main script is waiting on... They might be doing a long series of operations calling external systems, streaming files somewhere, etc and not performing one single action that could be canceled independently.  p  pUpdate 2 Some untested semipsuedo codep  precodeclass Foo1      async doSomething           call some external system          copy some files          put those files somewhere else s3       class Foo2      async doSomething           Do some long computations          Update some systems        class FooHandler      constructor          this.fooList  []           async start          await Promise.allthis.fooList.mapasync foo gt              return await foo.doSomething                 let handler  new FooHandler  handler.fooList.pushnew Foo1 handler.fooList.pushnew Foo2   if this call takes too long because of slow connections, errors,   whatever,  abort start, handle it in whatever meaningful way, and continue on. await handler.start codepre

So this seems like a feasible plan.p  pThe certificate store in windows looks pretty confusing to me. I think there are two optionsp  p1 Put it in My store for the user under which the IIS App pool run.

Negative 1532 pIm doing a program that will permit me to ping a lot of different IPs simultaneously around 5070.p  pI also need to delay the sending of each packet by say 1 ms, for multiple reasons, notably not getting my packets dropped by some routers which drop ICMP packets when theres too much sent at once which mine does, on the sending machine, not the receiving one.p  pSo I did it in a separate thread a bit like that p  precode Send thread for      [...]    for int i  0 i lt ipcount i            Send calls sendto       Sendmsocket, iparray[i]       [...]       Sleep1  Delay by 1 ms        [...]    lockuntilnewsendoperation  codepre  pAnd in another thread, thread I would like to receive the packets with select, like thatp  precode Receive thread FDZEROampmfdsetread FDSETmsocket, ampmfdsetread int rdscount  select0, ampmfdsetread, 0, 0, amptvtimeout if rdscount gt 0     ProcessReadySocket  Calls recv and stuff else       Timed out     mbSendGrapeDone  true  codepre  pThe problem with this approach is that since both calls to select and sento use the same nonblocking socket msocket, calls to sendto would later block because select makes sendto block when both are called simultaneously for some strange reason... dont see such logic there, since socket is non blocking, but it still does, its ugly.p  pSo I decided to use one socket exclusively for sending then and replaced the linep  precodeSendmsocket, iparray[i] codepre  pwithp  precodeSendmsendSock, iparray[i]  msendSock is dedicated to sending only codepre  pI read on MSDN that for raw sockets each socket receives all packets for the protocol the socket is set to mine is IPPROTOICMP ofc. Here I quote p  blockquote   pThere are further limitations for applications that use a socket of   type SOCKRAW. For example, all applications listening for a specific   protocol will receive all packets received for this protocolp blockquote  pSO I thought even though my packets are sent with msendSock, I could still receive them using selectrecv on msocket, turns out I cant, select never returns the socket is readable. So Im kind of stuck, I cannot use select and send at the same time. Is there something Im doing wrongp  pby the way I want to use raw sockets, not builtin windows icmp functionsp  pTLDR How can I send and select simultaneously Because on the send thread, send blocks as soon as select gets called on the receive thread, even if I used FIONBIO on it non blocking. If I use two different sockets, one for sending and one destined to receive, I receive nothing on the receiving socket... p  pThanksp

Negative 1532 pI have some kind of feed with story elements which can be liked, just like Facebook has.p  pMy first step was just using the story model object to get the liked status and show that in a CKButtonComponent. The problem with that solution is that the button does not represent the expected new like status fast enough. Instead Im making a web service call, which response changes the story and then the button gets changed.p  pTo get a faster button state change, I build a CKComponentController for that CKComponent which updates a state of the component when the button gets pressedp  precode voidtoggleLike      [self.component updateStateid oldState         if [oldState integerValue]  LikeComponentStateInitial  [oldState integerValue]  LikeComponentStateNotLiked              return LikeComponentStateLiked                  return STGLikeComponentStateNotLiked     ]     [WebService toggleLikeForStory...]  codepre  pAdditionally Im making a web service call. The problem with that solution is that when I press the likeButton multiple times fast enough the app crashes with the message p  p Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException, reason Unhandled component action toggleLike following responder chain nilp  pThe crash happens at an Assert in codevoid CKComponentActionSendCKComponentAction action, CKComponent sender, id context, CKComponentActionSendBehavior behaviorcode in the CKComponentAction class. I dont know why this happens only when i hit the button fast enough multiple times. It seems to have something to do with reload of all components which happens when the new story data get saved from the web service response. The reload of all components and at the same time the CKButtonComponent getting the touch event seems to lead to the crash.p  pThe CKComponentAction of the CKButtonComponent is the described CKComponentController method codetoggleLikecode.p  pSo what would be a good solution in this case Is there a way to do this without changing the story model object p  pI have also the feeling that my approach to use the state to override some model data like status is generally not really a good idea.p

Negative 1532 pIve been adding admob banner ads into my android app using the standard code available in the get started section on their website. Everything is fine except theres a few second delay after the activity starts before the ad is loaded. Ive seen people having the same problem and asking about preloading the ad however theres no clear solution available anywhere. I know most apps on the market dont have this delay so my question is how to work around it I could load all the ads into an array list in my loading activity and store them in shared preferences however I have read that its discouraged. p

The website I am looking at is a hrefhttpwww.ah.nlproductenversekantenklaarmaaltijdensalades relnofollowhttpwww.ah.nlproductenversekantenklaarmaaltijdensaladesa The links I am looking for are the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIan7q.png altenter image description herep  pIf one goes to this website and inspects for example the element Maaltijdsalades, then you can see that the links are under ulli using XPath syntax. The problem is that in that same HTML code, there is another place where ulli is used for links I am not looking for. I used the following spider and it crawls exactly the links which I do not want.p  pI am using the following spiderp  precodeimport scrapy  from ahlinks.items import AhLinksItem  class AhSpiderscrapy.Spider     name  ahlinks     alloweddomains  [ah.nl]     starturls[httpwww.ah.nlproductenaardappelgroentefruit,      ]  def parseself, response     for sel in response.xpathulli         item  AhLinksItem         item[title]  sel.xpathahref.extract         yield item codepre  pI need help on solving this one. Thanks.p

Negative 1532 pI have been following the Christian Richards Photon Server Framework tutorial for quite a bit now, fixing errors here and there. I have came across something that doesnt even throw an error, yet its not doing what it should be. At the end of the tutorial photon episode 14, Christian shows us that the sub server should be registered and showing in the logs. When i build my project, then open it up with the photon control, the logs show everything but that. The logs throw no errors, but do not display what they should be.  For example, the Proxy log SHOULD be saying that it received a register request but it doesnt, as well as the Login saying that there is no existing response handler.p  pComplexServer Logp  blockquote   p48068 195646.598  Service Photon Socket Server starting 48068   195646.598  Config File   CPhotondeploybinWin64PhotonServer.config 48068 195646.599    Will produce at most 10 crash dumps 48068 195646.599  Action run   as exe 48068 195646.600  Server Starting... 48068 195646.600     Tick count 42761421 wraps in 49.2153 days 48068 195646.600    Tick count 64 42761421 48068 195646.600  Photon Version   3.4.8.2804 48068 195646.600  PID 45344 48068 195646.600  Config File CPhotondeploybinWin64PhotonServer.config 48068   195646.601  Will NOT log unimportant exceptions 48068 195646.604    Not using performance counters as they are not currently installed.

Negative 1532 pSay I want to build a graph at compile time, using some algorithm, and then count how many nodes ended up in the graph. This seems like an ideal situation for constexpr, rather than template metaprogramming, since the goal is a computation that yields a value, rather than really being about types. I have some code that works, but the feature is so new Im afraid the compilers are being lenient, and I could interpret part of the standard as saying I cant do this.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  struct A  int x constexpr Aint i noexcept  xi   struct B  Aamp a constexpr BAamp a noexcept  aa    constexpr int foo       A a55     B ba     return b.a.x   templateltint Ngt void output      stdcout ltlt N ltlt stdendl   int main       to be absolutely sure compile time evald,      pass as template arg     constexpr auto b  foo     outputltbgt  codepre  pBoth the codeacode and codebcode instances are created at compile time, and they have the same lifetime so this should be safe. But codeacode is a nonstatic object, and a hrefhttpeel.iscdraftexpr.const5 relnofollowthis part of the standarda seems to say thats not allowedp  blockquote   pAn entity is a permitted result of a constant expression if it is an   object with static storage duration that is either not a temporary   object or is a temporary object whose value satisfies the above   constraints, or it is a function.p blockquote  pSo can I or cant I a hrefhttpmelpon.orgwandboxpermlink2VOpd7U0YfbdtPBq relnofollowGCC and clang are both fine with it.ap

Negative 1532 pWhat I have so farp  ul liTwo VirtualBox LAMP machines separate locations where I connect my two Windows development machines via SFTP, to write code using PHPStorm. li liOne VPS machine where I deploy my code written for a project in Laravel.li ul  pWhat I am trying to achievep  pFast and easy code deployment, as in write the code in Windows via PHPStorm, test it on the LAMP machine, deploy to VPS if necessary.p  pThe problem is that I need to use some codephp artisancode commands on LAMP machines to get some code generated. This means that I always have to synchronize PHPStorm with LAMP files tree in order to see the changes. Then, I need to also sync the other dev LAMP machine and the other PHPStorm running on Windows machine number 2. I know that this can be done via Git. So everytime I use the command line to generate code, I need to sync 4 machines excluding the deployment server.p  pLater, if I add another pair of WindowsLAMP dev machines, the complexity grows.p  pBack in the days of Dreamweaver, I could write code directly on the deployment server. Not the greatest idea, but it was way much simpler and faster, and thats what I need now.p  pAny ideas on how can I simplify thisp  pSwitching to WAMP so I can have files in sync with PHPStorm because all is locally is not OK because...

Negative 1532 pSo Im using a yeoman project from swiip called generatorgulpangular  just do npm search gulpangular and youll see it.p  pOut of the box the client is running from 127.0.0.13000 and I wish to make a http call to a python service on 127.0.0.18080.

Negative 1532 pIm using an application written in LabVIEW an engineering software frameworkprogramming language to run about twenty thousand simulations. Each simulation takes about 5 mins to complete, and results will be dumped into a database hosted in a laptop in my local network. Im using SQL Express as my database. p  pEach simulation job has a set of starting parameters that will be passed to the application. This could be as simple as a string of characters that the application would parse into valid simulation characteristics, but Im not sure exactly how to structure this.p  pBecause the simulations would take about 3 months to run on one computer, I want to add in the capability for the database computer to be able to schedule jobs. That way, I can run the application on any computer in my local network I have 5 available for a few simulations, and stop simulations when I need to use it for other things. The database computer will hand out these jobs as they get requested by the application, as well as continuously run jobs itself.p  pHow would I go about setting up this queue from an SQL point of view The framework I currently have in mind would work something like this Database has 3 tables in addition to tables used to store simulation data. The tables contain CompletedJobs,RunningJobs, and JobsToRun. The application would request a job from JobsToRun, and place that jobs ID into the RunningJobs table. It would then parse the jobs ID for relevant information, run the simulation, and if it exits without errors, move the job ID to the CompletedJobs table.p  pWould this workp

The data read from the queues is serialized and sent to external devices via a Socket connection.p  pThe application simultaneously listens to port 500 for incoming socket connections from external devices and writes the message to a remote transactional queue.p  pstrongThe issuestrongp  pThe application creates a thread, initiates an MSMQ read operation, opens a socket connection to a physical device and transmits the message This happens perfectly until the application creates about 1400  1600 threads. But beyond that the application is not able to read from the queue. However, the incoming queue is still able to read from the port and write to the remote queue.p  pWe tried using Process Monitor v3.2 and found that the threads are held in a DelayExecution state even after 120,758,387 cycles.p  pThis doesnt happen on our On Premise physicalvirtual servers.  The application has been moved to Azure VM as is without any code changes.p  pstrongWhat we triedstrongp  pUpscaling the server to D series with mode CPU core and RAM  Didnt help Move the workload to a different on premise server  Works as expectedp  pQuestionsp  pIs there any outbound socket connection limit in Windows Azure Are there any exceptions we need to create to allow such application behaviorp
