Positive 823 pGreeting everyone.  Due to some special reason, we have to reimplement the AVX2 intrics like the following wayp  precodestatic inline m256i attributealwaysinline, nodebug     xmm256andsi256m256i s1, m256i s2      m256i result      asm vpand 2, 1, 0 rresult rm s1, rm s2        sorry, this statement does not work      return result   codepre  pCorresponding function is codemm256andsi256m256i s1, m256i s2code, which is an AVX2 intrincs. After some search through google, I found some simililar such as connect some base type like codeintcode, codefloatcode and codelongcode to input registers.  However, I still didnt find the way to connect the input parameters codes1code and codes2code to the input registers codeymm1code and codeymm2code which are used for the asm codevpandcode code. p  pSo anyone here is willing to help me to make the above example work Thank you so much in advancep
Positive 823 pIn general, without using OSspecific methods, how can an x86 application detect that its running in AMD64 compatibility mode instead of legacy modep  pI know I can get codecr0code in user space by just doing codesmsw eaxcode or similar nonprivileged instruction useful to check whether e.g. pagingcache... is enabled, but after reading Intels System Programming Guide section 9.8.5 emInitializing IA32e Modeem, I learned that this is hardly useful, because IA32e mode is enabled via codeIA32EFERcode MSR, which is inaccessible to ring 3 code. So is there still any way to reliably discriminate between legacy and compatibility modesp
Positive 823 pI have code in my custom bootloader that copies memory from a 512byte buffer at address code0x8E00code into high memory, code0x100000code and higher. This works fine on some computers, and crashes triplefaults, I assume on others. This code also works fine in the Bochs x86 emulator.p  pI have tried replacing the custom segmentoffset copy loop with a coderep movsbcode, setting codeesicode and codeedicode to the appropriate addresses, and finding this also faults on some computers. Is there emanyem reason why this should failp  pBootload.asmp  precodeBOOTLOADERSECTORS equ 3                 includes first sector, loaded by   BIOS   a boot sector that enters 32bit protected mode

Positive 823 pIf a Core writes but the cache line is not present in its L1, so it writes to the Store Buffer. Another Core requests that cache line, MESI cannot see the Store Buffer update and returns the unmodified cache line. The Store Buffer is flushed shortly after, but the second Core already uses the older value.p  pI dont see how an codeSFENCEcode solves this problem Yes the cache line will be updated sooner, but the Core still needs to wait to write the value to L1 and during this time the second Core can request to readp

However, the last time that I mixed a high level language and assembler was using Borland Pascal about 1520 years ago when writing graphics drivers for games preWindows 95 era.  My familiarity is with Intel syntax.p  pstrongWhat I dont knowstrongp  pHow do I access members of bnt especially dat from asm  Since dat is a pointer to uint32, I am accessing the elements as an array eg. bn1dat[i].p  pHow do I access local variables that are declared on the stackp  pI am using pushpop to restore clobbered registers to their previous values so as to not upset the compiler.  However, do I also need to include the volatile keyword on the local variables as wellp  pOr, is there a better way that I am not aware of  I dont want to put this in a separate function call because of the calling overhead as this function is performance critical.p  pstrongAdditionalstrongp  pRight now, Im just starting to write this function so it is no where complete.  There are missing loops and other such supportglue code.  But, the main gist is accessing local variablesstructure elements.p  pEDIT 1p  pThe syntax that I am using seems to be the only one that clang supports.

Positive 823 pLets focus on one dll CWindowsSystem32wbemwmiutils.dll. Why Because its the file in which I personally discovered Windows delivers a different dll depending on process architecture.p  pTLDR Is there a way to programmatically determine the actual path of the dll that was returned by the file system redirectorp  pI understand that if launched as a x86 process, I get CWindowsSysWOW64wbemwmiutils.dll. And, if launched as a x64 process, I get CWindowsSystem32wbemwmiutils.dll.p  pI need to determine which wmiutils.dll Im actually looking at. The redirector makes system32wbemwmiutils.dll look and feel identical but its not. If I use parent path, I get CWindowsSystem32wbem even though I maymay not be looking at CWindowsSysWOW64wbem.p  pAny sweet python magic to make this happen I cant seem to see anything from other languages I can port. Based on my use case, Ive come up with a couple hacks but theyre just that. Hoping somebody has found a solution as easy as parent path that actually works in this case.p

Negative 823 pI have a silverlight 2 beta 2 application that accesses a WCF web service.  Because of this, it currently can only use basicHttp binding.  The webservice will return fairly large amounts of XML data.  This seems fairly wasteful from a bandwidth usage standpoint as the response, if zipped, would be smaller by a factor of 5 I actually pasted the response into a txt file and zipped it..  p  pThe request does have the AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate  Is there any way have the WCF service gzip or otherwise compress the responsep  pI did find this a hrefhttpwww.vistax64.comindigo113763wcfclientj2eeserverusinggzip.htmllinka but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled outofthebox IMHO.p  pOK  at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never seem to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work.  Well, as it turns outp  ol lipDynamic Compression on IIS7 strongwasstrong working al along.  It is just that Nikhils Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working.  My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it under the covers and Nikhils tool never sees the compressed response.  I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application.  In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressedpli lipThe other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR.pli ol  pSo from my perspective, the EASIEST way to enable WCF compression in Silverlight is to enable Dynamic Compression in IIS7 and write no code at all.p

Negative 823 pIm currently refactoring some code on a project that is wrapping up, and I ended up putting a lot of business logic into service classes rather than in the domain objects.  At this point most of the domain objects are data containers only.  I had decided to write most of the business logic in service objects, and refactor everything afterwards into better, more reuseable, and more readable shapes.  That way I could decide what code should be placed into domain objects, and which code should be spun off into new objects of their own, and what code should be left in a service class.  So I have some codep  precodepublic decimal CaculateBatchTotalVendorApplicationBatch batch       IListltVendorApplicationgt applications  AppRepo.GetByBatchIdbatch.Id       if applications  null  applications.Count  0           throw new ArgumentExceptionThere were no applications for this batch, that shouldnt be possible      decimal total  0m      foreach VendorApplication app in applications           total  app.Amount      return total  codepre  pThis code seems like it would make a good addition to a domain object, because its only input parameter is the domain object itself.  Seems like a perfect candidate for some refactoring.  But the only problem is that this object calls another objects repository.

Negative 823 pI was thinking today about the best way to store a hierarchical set of nodes, e.g.p  pimg srchttpwww2002.orgCDROMalternate738p738brailsfordfig5.jpg altalt text p  pThe most obvious way to represent this to me at least would be for each node to have nextSibling and childNode pointers, either of which could be null.p  pThis has the following propertiesp  ol liRequires a small number of changes if you want to add in or remove a node somewhereli liIs highly susceptible to corruption. If one node was lost, you could potentially lose a large amount of other nodes that were dependent on being found through that nodes pointers.li ol  pAnother method you might use is to come up with a system of coordinates, e.g. 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2. 1.2.3 would be the 3rd node at the 3rd level, with the 2nd node at the prior level as its parent. Unanticipated loss of a node would not affect the ability to resolve any other nodes. However, adding in a node somewhere has the potential effect of changing the coordinates for a large number of other nodes.p  pWhat are ways that you could store a hierarchy of nodes that requires few changes to add or delete a node and is resilient to corruption of a few nodes not implementationspecificp

Negative 823 pI have recently begin creating an image editing tool which will cater to a very specific need.  This is as much for the people who are going to use it as it is for my own entertainment.  however, I have hit a bit of an architectural snag early on.  p  pLike any image editor, the user will use tools to draw on and manipulate an image.  My first attempt at this consisted of a simple interfacep  precodepublic interface IDrawingTool      void DrawEffect Graphics g       other stuff  codepre  pThis I thought would be nice and clean and would allow for easy maintenance and extension.  Just add the interface objects in and call the DrawEffect method of the selected one at runtime.  p  pThe problem with this approach is that different drawing tools do not cleanly adhere to a single interface.  For example, a pen tool need only know the point to draw at in order to work.  The rectangle however needs the first point clicked, as well as the current position.  The polygon tool needs to keep track of multiple mouse clicks.p  pI am having trouble thinking of a nice way to implement this.  The best method that I can think of now would involve a switch statement and a case for each tool, which would mean that the drawing logic would be in the Canvas class, not encapsulated by Tool type objects.  because this is practice, I would like to do this the right way.  Thanks for any help in advance.p

Negative 823 pNOTE Ive updated this question from the initial inquiry about child containers towards creating components ondemandp  pHeres my design problem Im using the Windsor container for the main application workflow, but I have certain actions I need to create ondemand for example, when the user clicks on a menu item. I want these actions to be autowired with context information for example, codeDeletePointsActioncode action would have to get a list of points to be deleted in the constructor. p  pInitially I was thinking about having some sort of a miniIoC which would be constantly updated with such context information and then used for wiring and I was wondering whether child containers could do the job. p  pBut after reading a bit more about child containers and thinking my problem through, Ive now found a solution which seems better at least at the first glance strongkeeping a codeDictionarycode with this context informationstrong and using this dictionary when creating actions from the Windsor container. The only drawback I see right now is that the names of the keys in the dictionary must always correspond to the names of constructor parameters for actions.p  pThe alternative is to write my own stronga hrefhttphammett.castleproject.orgp257 relnofollowcustom dependency resolverastrong which would be smart enough to figure out dependencies based on the dictionary value type and not necessarily its key name.

Negative 823 pI want to implement a collection, whose items need to be tested for emptiness. In case of a reference type, one would test for being null.

Negative 823 pI downloaded the latest pyrocms zip file and I noticed something strange happening.

I even used a full xampp 1.7.2 install for linux and nothing. Maybe this is important, I have other client websites running on both win and ubuntu running off CI and no problem.

Negative 823 pI am currently working on a project where I a data matching algorithm needs to be implemented. An external system passes in all data it knows about a customer, and the system I design has to return the customer matched. So the external system then knows the correct id of the customer plus it gets additional data or can update its own data of the specific customer.p  pThe following fields are passed inp  ul liName li liName2li liStreetli liCityli liZipCode   li liBankAccountNumberli liBankNameli liBankCodeli liEmailli liPhoneli liFaxli liWebli ul  pThe data can be of high quality and alot of information is available, but often the data is crappy and just the name and address is available and might have spellings.p  pIm implementing the project in .Net. What I currently do is something like the followingp  precodepublic bool IsMatchCustomer customer       CanIdentify just checks if the info is provided and has a specific length e.g. gt 1     if CanIdentifyByStreet ampamp CanIdentifyByBankAccountNumber               some parsing of strings done before substring, etc.         ifStreet  customer.Street ampamp AccountNumber  customer.BankAccountNumber return true          if CanIdentifyByStreet ampamp CanIdentifyByZipCode ampampCanIdentifyByName              ...       codepre  pI am not very happy with the approach above. This is because I would have to write if statements for all reasonable cases combinations so I dont miss any chance of matching the entity.p  pSo I thought maybe I could create some kind of matching score. So for each criteria matched, a score would be added. Likep  precodepublic bool IsMatchCustomer customer      int matchingScore  0     if CanIdentifyByStreet              if....             matchingScore  10          if CanIdentifyByName              if....             matchingScore  10          if CanIdentifyBankAccountNumber              if....             matchingScore  10           ifmatchingScore gt iDontKnow         return true  codepre  pThis would allow me to take in consideration all matching data, and depending on some weight I would increase the matching score. If the score is high enough, its a match.p  pKnow my question is Are there any best practices out there for such things, like matching algorithm patterns etc Thanks alotp

Negative 823 pOne if the first things I learned when I started with C was the most important one. You can decompile any .NET assembly with Reflector or other tools. Many developers are not aware of this fact and most of them are shocked when I show them their source code.p  pProtection against decompilation is still a difficult task. I am still looking for a fast, easy and secure way to do it. I dont want to obfuscate my code so my method names will be a,b,c or so. Reflector or other tools should be unable to recognize my application as .NET assembly at all. I know about some tools already but they are very expensive. Is there any other way to protect my applicationsp  pEDITp  pThe reason for my question is not to prevent piracy. I only want to stop competitors from reading my code. I know they will and they already did. They even told me so. Maybe I am a bit paranoid but business rivals reading my code doesnt make me feel good. p
Negative 823 pI am modifying GLPaint to use a different background, so in this case it is white. Anyway the existing stamp they are using assumes the background is black, so I made a new background with an alpha channel.

This is great becausep  ol liClients do not pay for construction of irrelevant information they will probably not use most of the time people are only interested in file names, andli liClients can get at all the information provided by the FindXFile APIs if they need or want this information.li ol  pThis becomes an issue though because there is only ever a single copy of the objects actual data. Therefore, when the iterator is incrememented, all of the proxies are invalidated set to whatever the next file pointed to by the iterator is.p  pIm concerned if this is a major problem, because I can think of a case where the proxy object would not behave as somebody would expectp  precodestdvectorltMyIteratorvaluetypegt files stdcopyMyIteratorHello, MyIterator, stdbackinserterfiles codepre  pbecause the vector contains nothing but a bunch of invalid proxies at that point. Instead, clients need to do something likep  precodestdvectorltstdwstringgt filesToSearch stdtransform  DirectoryIteratorltFilesOnlygtLCWindows,  DirectoryIteratorltFilesOnlygt,  stdbackinserterfilesToSearch,  stdmemfunrefampDirectoryIteratorltFilesOnlygtvaluetypeGetFullFileName  codepre  pSeeing this, I can see why somebody might dislike what the standard library designers did with codestdvectorltboolgtcode. Im still wondering though is this a reasonable trade off in order to achieve 1 and 2 above If not, is there any way to still achieve 1 and 2 without the proxyp  pEDIT Updated codep  precodepragma once include ltlistgt include ltstringgt include ltboostnoncopyable.hppgt include ltboostmakeshared.hppgt include ltboostiteratoriteratorfacade.hppgt include ltWindows.hgt include ltShlwapi.hgt pragma commentlib, shlwapi.lib include ..Exception.hpp  namespace WindowsAPI  namespace FileSystem   class Win32FindData      WIN32FINDDATA internalData     stdwstring rootPath public     Win32FindDataconst stdwstringamp root, const WIN32FINDDATAamp data          rootPathroot, internalDatadata      DWORD GetAttributes const          return internalData.dwFileAttributes          bool IsDirectory const          return internalData.dwFileAttributes amp FILEATTRIBUTEDIRECTORY  0          bool IsFile const          return IsDirectory          unsigned int64 GetSize const          ULARGEINTEGER intValue         intValue.LowPart  internalData.nFileSizeLow         intValue.HighPart  internalData.nFileSizeHigh         return intValue.QuadPart          stdwstring GetFolderPath const          return rootPath          stdwstring GetFileName const          return internalData.cFileName          stdwstring GetFullFileName const          return rootPath  L  internalData.cFileName          stdwstring GetShortFileName const          return internalData.cAlternateFileName          FILETIME GetCreationTime const          return internalData.ftCreationTime          FILETIME GetLastAccessTime const          return internalData.ftLastAccessTime          FILETIME GetLastWriteTime const          return internalData.ftLastWriteTime        class EnumerationMethod  public boostnoncopyable  protected     WIN32FINDDATAW currentData     HANDLE hFind     stdwstring currentDirectory     EnumerationMethod  hFindINVALIDHANDLEVALUE      void IncrementCurrentDirectory          if hFind  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE return         BOOL success              FindNextFilehFind, ampcurrentData         if success             return         DWORD error  GetLastError         if error  ERRORNOMOREFILES              FindClosehFind             hFind  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE          else              WindowsApiExceptionThrowerror                   virtual EnumerationMethod          if hFind  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE             FindClosehFind      public     bool equalconst EnumerationMethodamp other const          if this  ampother             return true         return hFind  other.hFind          Win32FindData dereference          return Win32FindDatacurrentDirectory, currentData        class NonRecursiveEnumeration  public EnumerationMethod  public     NonRecursiveEnumeration      NonRecursiveEnumerationconst stdwstringamp pathSpec          stdwstringconstiterator lastSlash              stdfindpathSpec.rbegin, pathSpec.rend, L.base         if lastSlash  pathSpec.begin             currentDirectory.assignpathSpec.begin, lastSlash1         hFind  FindFirstFileWpathSpec.cstr, ampcurrentData         if hFind  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE             WindowsApiExceptionThrowFromLastError         while hFind  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE ampamp wcscmpcurrentData.cFileName, L.  wcscmpcurrentData.cFileName, L..

Negative 823 pDear skilled. Im developing an entity which allows user to copy multiple files in async manner with cancellation ability and reporting progress as well. Obviously the process of copying runs in another thread, different from thread where CopyAsync was called.p  pMy first implementation uses FileStream.BeginReadBeginWrite with a buffer and reporting progress against number of usages of that buffer. p  pLater, for education purposes, I was trying to implement the same stuff thru Win32 CopyFileEx function. Eventually, Ive stumbled upon the following thing this function takes a pointer to bool value which is treated as cancellation indicator. According to MSDN this value is to be examined multiple times by Win32 during copying operation. When user sets this value to false the copying operation is cancelled.p  pThe real problem for me is how to create a boolean value, pass it to Win32 and to make this value accessible for external user to give him an ability to cancel the copying operation. Obviously the user will call CancelAsyncobject taskId, so my question is about how to get access to that boolean value in another thread fro my CancelAsync implementation.p  pMy first attempt was to use Dictionary  where key is an identifier of async operation and value points to allocated for boolean value memory slot. When user calls CancelAsyncobject taskId method, my class retrieves a pointer to that allocated memory from dictionary and writes 1 there.p  pYesterday Ive developed another solution which is based on creating a bool local variable in my method of copying and holding the address of that value in dictionary until copying operation completes. This approach could be described in the following lines of code very simple and rough, just to illustrate an ideap  precodeclass Program       dictionary for storing operaitons identifiers     public Dictionaryltstring, IntPtrgt dict  new Dictionaryltstring,IntPtrgt      static void Mainstring[] args              Program p  new Program          p.StartTheThread  start the copying operation, in my                                 implementation it will be a thread pool thread           ManualResetEvent mre      public void StartTheThread              Thread t  new ThreadThreadTask mre  new ManualResetEventfalse         t.Startnull          GC.Collect  just to ensure that such solution works          GC.Collect          mre.WaitOne          unsafe  cancel the copying operation                      IntPtr ptr  dict[one]             bool boolPtr  boolptr  obtaining a reference                                          to local variable in another thread             boolPtr  false                    public void ThreadTaskobject state                In this thread Win32 call to CopyFileEx will be         bool var  true         unsafe                      dict[one]  IntPtrampvar  fill a dictionary                                               with cancellation identifier                  mre.Set           Actually Win32 CopyFileEx call will be here         whiletrue                      Console.WriteLineDict0, dict[one]             Console.WriteLineVar0, var             Console.WriteLine             Thread.Sleep1000                codepre  pActually Im a bit new to PInvoke and all unsafe stuff so hesitating about latter approach for holding a reference to local value in dictionary and exposing this value to another thread.p  pAny other thoughts on how to expose that pointer to boolean in order to support cancellation of copying operationp

Negative 823 pI am using BOOSTPP for to do precompile computations in the preprocessor. I am focusing on an application where code size is strongextremelystrong important to me. So please dont say the compiler emshouldem or emusuallyem does that, I need to control what is performed at compile time and what code is generated. However, I want to be able to use the same name of the macrofunction for both integer constants and variables. As trivial example, I can havep  precodedefine TWICEn BOOSTPPMULn,2 .....  somewhere else in code int a  TWICE5 codepre  pThis does what I want it to, evaluating to p  precodeint a  10 codepre  pduring compile time.p  pHowever, I also want it to be used atp  precodeint b  5 int a  TWICEb codepre  pThis should be preprocessed to p  precodeint b  5 int a  5  2 codepre  pOf course, I can do so by using the traditional macros likep  precodedefine TWICEn n  2 codepre  pBut then it doesnt do what I want it to do for integer constants evaluating them during compile time. p  pSo, my question is, is there a trick to check whether the argument is a literal or a variable, and then use different definitions. i.e., something like thisp  precodedefine TWICEn BOOSTPPIF ISCONSTANTn,                                BOOSTPPMULn,2,                                n  2  codepre  pedit So what I am really after is some way to check if something is a constant available at compile time, and hence a good argument for the BOOSTPP functions. I realize that this is different from what most people expect from a preprocessor and general programming recommendations. But there is no emwrongem way of programming, so please dont hate on the question if you disagree with its philosophy. There is a reason the BOOSTPP library exists, and this question is in the same spirit. It might just not be possible though.p

Negative 823 pI have a number of different projects, which are maturing to the level that I will be buying code signing certificates for them.  My understanding of a codesigning certificate is that it is meant to establish a trust relationship between my userbase, and the developer me.  To that end, it would make sense to buy one codesigning certificate and sign all my projects with the same certificate.  However, I also am aware that another function of the codesigning certificate is to encrypt parts of the deployment to ensure that the product is not tampered with prior to the userbase installing it.  Its my understanding that the more often a certificate or any encryption method is used on different data in this case my multiple projects, the less secure it becomes Im generalizing here a little, I know.p  pSo, my question isp  pShould I get one code certificate per deployment, or only one and sign them all with itp  pI understand also that this may be a slightly subjective question, so if thats the case, perhaps we can simply offer pros and cons for the two options.p

Negative 823 pI need some advice on my project. I am going to use various C libraries to accomplish different tasks. I am using Visual Studio 2008. To me, it seems to get a little out of hand when I add the actual source code of the library to my projects path. p  pIt seems easier to just use the include files of the library, and just link precompiled binaries to my application. So my question is this. Is it better for me to include the source code of each library to my project, compile and link, or will it be better to just compile the libraries separately or download a precompiled version and link it to my program Are there any pitfalls of the second wayp  pThanksp

Negative 823 pMy work assignment of late has been developing an interactive PDF catalog of our products that my superior can distribute digitally and let potential customers browse without accessing the website.p  pWe have an Excel file that lists all the details of our products  name, description, title, image, category, etc. I have used Data Merge to create this 300 page document rather than handcopy each products information to a single page.p  pUnfortunately I am now stuck  I have designed the catalog in such a way that I have an image that I want to make a button which, if the person wishes to purchase a product, will take them directly the the product page online where he or she can add it to the shopping cart. This is great, but I cannot seem to find a way to make the image buttons link a variable as the rest of the page content. Links to each product page are included in the CSV file, but without a variable web link method, I would have to create the unique links individually, which kinda defeats the purpose of using Data Merge anyway.p  pSo my question is this  is there any way to make a URL button an image have a web link function that can read from a CSV file and change each page like other imported content Ive asked in the Adobe Forums and the one answer I received was for using JavaScript, so I came here. If not, is there another way to automate the individual link process without setting it up on each generated pagep  pThanks in advance,p  pAsherp

Negative 823 pCan anyone tell me if the key frames in a CAKeyframeAnimation are always guaranteed to be hit with their exact values when the animation runs Or... do they only act as interpolation guides e.g. If I specify, say, 3 points on a path for some arbitrary property to follow  lets call it position  and I specify an execution time of 0.3f seconds, whilst obviously points 1 and 3 must be hit as they are the terminal points can I guarantee that point 2 will be evaluated exactly as specified in the key frame array Surprisingly, I havent found a single document that gives an adequate answer. I ask this because Im writing an OpenAL soundeffect synchroniser that uses a keyframe animations path to trigger various short sounds along its length and whilst most of them get executed, now and again a few dont and I dont know if its my logic thats wrong or my code.

Negative 823 pWhen I perform codetf rename ProjectMainFile1.cs ProjectMainFile2.cscode in TFS2010, I know that once I check in there will be a rename change on the codeProjectMainFile2.cscode slot, and a delete, source rename change on the codeProjectMainFile1.cscode slot. p  pHowever, while the changes are still pending, only the rename change exists as a pending change. No changes are displayed in Pending Change to indicate that codeProjectMainFile1.cscode is being renamed. In fact, if you execute codetf status ProjectMainFile1.cscode tf.exe claims there are no pending changes, which is totally false.p  pIn my situation, I have a series of about 100 files that I have manually merged as part of a branch integration operation, and following a reexecution of the codetf mergecode command at the command line, I am simply trying to undo the files to which they apply so that I may unshelve the merged changes. p  pHowever, the Tfs object models codePendingChangecode objects can supply me only with the codeServerPathcode, which refers to the source rename item, not the rename item. I am at a loss about how I can trace my shelved pending changes to the items that would need to be undone in my workspace.p  pHow can I get the original prerename server path for items in a shelf that have been renamedp

Negative 823 pI am developing an iPhone application. I have my code implemented this wayp  pRootViewController has UIScrollView as its view. Then RootViewController pushes another UIViewController say vc which again has UIScrollView sv as its view.p  pThe boundsframe size of sv is 320, 460 and content size is 320, 520. So, sv is now scrollable vertically. Hence, I have set content offset of sv to be 0, 60.p  pI switch to background using Home button of iPhone and again put my application to Foreground. In this case my sv content offset is set to 0, 0 automatically with animation.p  pWhen I tried to override setContentOffset I noticed that some library call [adjustsIfNeeded], sets content offset to be 0, 0.p  pCould someone me tell me why is this happeningp  pThanks and Regards, Deepap

Negative 823 pHypothetical question at the momentp  pSuppose I have a great idea for an application. It acts on data which can be wellrepresented by tables in a relational database, using interlinked objects which represent those tables. It supports a welldefined API for interacting with Creating, Reading, Updating, Deleting those objects, and viewing information about them.p  pIn short, its a perfect fit for Rails... except it doesnt want to be a webapp. Perhaps it wants a Command Line interface or an OSnative dialogbased interface or perhaps it wants to present itself as a resource to other apps. Whatever  it just isnt designed to present itself over HTTP.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3056133accessmodelsfromoutsiderailsappThesea a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3408426israilsappropriateforusewithanonwebcentricappquestionsa suggest its certainly possible, but both approach the problem from the point of view of adapting an existing webapp to have an additional, nonweb, interface. p  pIm interested in knowing what the best way to emcreateem such an app would be. Would you be best to coderails new nonwebappcode, in order to get the skeleton built for free, then write some normal Ruby code that coderequirecodes codeconfigenvironmentcode  but then you have a lot of webcentric cruft that you dont need Or would it be better to roll up your sleeves and build it from whole cloth, taking just the libraries you need and manually writing any required configurationp  pIf the latter, what exactly emisem needed to make a Rails app, but without the web bitsp

Negative 823 pI have a serious problem with calculating emStandard Deviation within subgroupem in SSRSSQl whichever is more convenient. The real reason behind this is I need to calculate Sigma value according to Six Sigma principles or alternatively Cpk value process capability, but my efforts stop at the standard deviation.p  pIm not strong with statistics but it seems that emStDevem and emStDevPem functions in SSRS and SQL are not calculated within subgroup, and I cannot find a function that could do that.

In reading I saw that there are what facebook calls strongnamed fieldsstrong and strongcustom fieldsstrong. What I am looking for is a check box that says Like us on facebook. If that is clicked and the form is submitted the user auto likes our page. p  pI would think that there would be a field in strongnamed fieldsstrong area that does this.p  pSome of the research I have done suggests that forcing an auto like on a user is black hat and could result in the deletion of your facebook page. This registration plugin seems like a good way to get the user to opt in to facebook marketing. Yes I could auto like them on submit if the box is checked but then how would facebook know that I have permission to do this.p  pDoes anyone have a white hat solution to liking a facebook page within a form besides the obvious facebook like box pluginp

Negative 823 pIm completely stumped with a problem using CoreLocation.p  pIve checked out some other questions and on Google but cant seem to find anyone with this particular problem Im having.p  pI am utilizing CoreLocation in my App and when I call code[manager startUpdatingLocation]code then the little blue arrow on the status bar appears and the service begins and all is well.p  pIn the app I have a UITabBarController, now only the first Tab makes use of CoreLocation so in my first Tab ViewControllers codeviewDidDisappearcode method, I call code[manager stopUpdatingLocation]codep  pNow here is where things go wrong, If I manually just tap the different tabs then the little blue arrow disappears and reappears as I go back and forth between the tabs as I would expect them to.p  pHowever, upon doing something on the first tab, it will automatically switch to another tab via code[self.tabBarController setSelectedIndex1]code, when this happens, the blue arrow on the status bar does NOT disappear, and even if I continuously go back and forth through the tabs, that arrow is now basically stuck there for as long as the app is active It does disappear if the app goes into the background though, but will reappear on any tab and stay stuck there as before if it becomes active again.p  pNow I thought, maybe changing the tabs programatically doesnt call codeviewDidDisappearcode, so I put a breakpoint there, but it does indeed get called.p  pThen I thought... Ok maybe if I call code[manager stopUpdatingLocation]code just before i call code[self.tabBarController setSelectedIndex1]code that would fix the problem, but that didnt do anything either.p  pNow Im lost for ideas and any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pP.S I have tested to see if the CoreLocation delegate methods are still being called, and they dont seem to be called anymore unless the initial tab is open, so it does seem as though CoreLocation has stopped. However, from a user perspective this wouldnt seem to be the case.p  pstrongEDITstrong Seems like this might be a problem with some third party libraries, so isnt really something that can be answeredp

Negative 823 pIf you have a 64 bit OS, you have an address space of virtually unlimited size. So my question is, does on such systems freeing memory matters much Even if you have limited RAM of say 4 GB, in a demand paging scheme memory only brought in when touched, the little overhead you would get as compared to freeing memory, is a few extra page swaps I guess, as memory you will not touch for a long time, will automatically be swapped. Am I missing something here Or is my argument validp  pPractically, if it is not a big performance hit, then I guess its a good thing for CC programmers, as memory leakage would no more be an important issue to deal withp

But since this public key may change in the future I want to be able to store it in its original form in a database.

Negative 823 pI need to export data from a SQL database some groups use SQL Server, some Oracle, etc. into a CSV where I need the ids from the joined table in a string.p  pFor example, I have a table of Classes and a table of Students. From Classes, I need ID, Name, Section, Time, and from Students I need a string of the IDs of Students in the class. The results would return the columns id,name,section,time,studentids. The studentids column should be a delimited string, such asp  precode32,43,53,12,41 codepre  pThe row output would end up being something likep  precode1405,Computer Science,101,12130,32,43,53,12,41 codepre  pThe number of Students per Class is not consistent, there could be one Student, or 20 Students. I thought about using a while loop using SQL Server to obtain this data, or a temp table that aggregates the keys, but I want to know if there is any way using standard SQL to accomplish this, so that the script can be portable.p  pNotes I know the output format is not ideal, but the only other option is that we will have to pull a different record for each ClassStudent combo, and then will have to aggregate the ids separately.p

Negative 823 pSorry if this question was already asked tons of times, but just hoped to find the information quicker by asking the question myself.

Negative 823 pIve got a few files that have been serialized by directly writing C codestructcodes using a binary codefstreamcode. Now, when I generate the read methods for corresponding C classes, I find out that these dont really map 1to1, probably because of structure packing.p  pSo my question is  what is the best way to handle the situation Ive got both C and C source code, so I can change either part. Should I attempt to serialize C without packing I assume this is done with codepragma pack1code, right or instead somehow adjust my C code to take account of the gapsp  pOr is the problem with deserializing completely different and nothing to do with packingp  pstrongUpdate 1strong I discovered that C codeenumcodes are 4 bytes long and codeboolcode values are 2 bytes long who knew, but even after adding codepragma pack1code I am only able to correctly read the first record. Also, Ive checked the number of bytes against codesizeofMyStructurecode and the values match. This must mean that there is some padding between the records.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Darn, found a bug in code. Copypaste error. Need PVS Studio or something. All good now.

Negative 823 pI am using Eclipselink and I have a JPA Entity that is basically a byte array of gzipped data stored as a blob in the database. However, this data is wrapped in a class that manages the byte array and can decode it correctly GzipByteArray. I used the Converter and Convert annotations to convert from the internal byte[] array in the database to my GzipByteArray wrapper class. The Entity actually stores the GzipByteArray class as the variable type. That all works OK. p  pHowever, when I want to append some text to the GzipByteArray, I call a method on it to append the text. Eclipselink is not detecting the change to this parameter of the parent Entity class.p  pI put a .equals and .hashCode method on my GzipByteArray to make sure it takes into account the change in the internal byte[] array. That doesnt help. Based on my logging statements, .equals is not even being called by Eclipselink. p  pThe only way I can get the changes to be detected is to create a new instance of GzipByteArray and use the setter to modify it. p  pI assume that Eclipselink is using the default a hrefhttpwiki.eclipse.orgIntroductiontoEclipseLinkTransactions28ELUG29DeferredChangeDetectionPolicy relnofollow titleDeferredChangeDetectionPolicyDeferredChangeDetectionPolicya. How does this work I even downloaded the source of Eclipselink, but I cant figure it out. Can I manually force this field to be marked as dirty somehow Does the instance ID of the object have to change in order for Eclipselink to detect itp

But this obviously doesnt work for cases where the folders arent source folders like the surefire reports. It emdoesem however fix one specific problem with warnings about generated sources, but might not in others, where the sources arent cant be included as source.li ol  pIt would just be nice if there was a way to tell eclipse not to display warnings about things in the target folder altogether, as its often not very useful and might hide actual problems.p  pCheers,br nbspnbspnbspnbspSvend. p

Negative 823 pI have a website optimized as a web app with iOS safari, so that adding to home screen opens the app in a separate Webview. However, it always opens in the 3.5 letter boxed mode, instead of stretching to fill the screen. I know that with native apps, you just have to add the iPhone 5 sized launch image. How can I do this for a web appp
Negative 823 pSearched the site relative to this question but didnt find what I was looking for.p  pI have a frameset with two child frames.br I have a list of links in the left frame and a div with the id myDiv in the right frame.p  pUsing jQuery, when I mouseover a link in the left fame, how can I use the .load method to load the myDiv that is in the right framep  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 823 pOkay, so I have created a user table inside of my database to hold all the users datap  precodeCREATE TABLE user  id INT NOT NULL autoincrement, username VARCHAR50 NOT NULL default , nicename VARCHAR255 NOT NULL default , email VARCHAR255 NOT NULL default , password VARCHAR255 NOT NULL default , permissions INT NOT NULL default 1, UNIQUE KEY usern username, UNIQUE KEY usere email,     PRIMARY KEY id  codepre  pI want the permissions field to dictate what users can and cannot see. IE. The permissions for the ACP would require a permissions level of 3 whereas 1 is a registered user and 0 is a guest visiting the site. How could I get a page to block itself depending upon a users permission level Thanks in advance. Using MySQLPHPp
Negative 823 pAfter updating some sound files in the .fla library, I started getting 5001 name of package does not reflect location errors for every file in an unrelated folder.br I understand the 5001 error, had it many times during development, but it was usually a case of a package typo, or a file in the wrong folder.  Here, however, it seems to be some sort of letter case issue.p  pIn the Location section of the Compiler Errors output, it lists the locations of every error ie, every class in the options folder as CUsers...powerupsOptionsClassName.as, note the uppercase Options.p  pHowever, when I look at the Windows properties of any files in the options folder, it confirms that the folder is lowercase, listing its location as CUsers...powerupsoptions.br When I let Flash autosuggest the package path it just suggests what it already was.p  pI fixed it on one occasion without changing anything by closing Flash and reopening, but then it starting occurring again after a few successful compiles.  Have not had any luck since  tried recreating a fresh folder, letting Flash recreate the project files, and restarting.p  pIm fairly certain I havent changed any relevant code  the only thing Ive been doing is adding some sound clips to the library and updating old ones.p

Negative 823 pNot sure if this is the right spot to ask but Im having a Java issue.  I have some Java code that works in Java 6 but not in Java 7, the error isp  precodejava.lang.IllegalStateException This function should be called while holding treeLock codepre  pUsing Java6 works but a few of our external users are running Java 7.  I figured out the error was caused by a call to codevalidateTreecode, which works in java6 but in Java7 we need to call codevalidatecode .  When I test it locally it works.p  pHeres my problem, I started working at a big corporate and they wont let us make any changes to the code until its been very throughly looked atmy working change is going to take affect in April 2013 but until then our users are getting annoyed.  Im not the best with Java and was wondering if there was a way I could pass a runtime parameters to have this changed or is there anything I can do without touching the code basep  pIm embrassed to ask this question since it could be solved easily by just implementing the fix but any ideas or direction would be very helpful.p  pUpdate Im ideally looking for something that I can get support to put in the java runtime parameter that would change all validateTree references to validate.p
Negative 823 pI am trying to write an HLSL pixel shader for a project I am working on. Basically want I want to do is if a texture has a pixel with a float value of 0.52 on scale of 0255 is 132.6 I want to output 133 60 of the time and output 132 40 of the time. Write now I am just trying to output the fractional remainder of the RGB value i.e. the chance to bump the pixel up however I always get a value of zero I think this is because the colors are getting quantized to a 0255 scale before they reach the shader but I dont know why this would be because I am useing the A32B32G32R32f format which should be able to store plenty of information about the colors. Here is my very simple shader code. I am using SlimDX DX9 if that matters.p  precodesampler2D Tex0  registers0 float4 DitherByChancefloat2 coords  TEXCOORD0  COLOR      float4 newColor  float40, 0, 0, 0    The pixel color to return     double4 oldColor  tex2DTex0, coords     double scale  0.0039215686274509803921568627451   1  255      double rPercentChance  fracoldColor.r  scale   Chance to round red channel up     double gPercentChance  fracoldColor.g  scale   Chance to round green channel up     double bPercentChance  fracoldColor.b  scale   Chance to round blue channel up      newColor.r  rPercentChance     newColor.g  gPercentChance     newColor.b  bPercentChance      newColor.a  1      return newColor   technique DitherViaChance          pass Pass1                  PixelShader  compile ps20 DitherByChance               codepre  pHere is my slimDX code if it mattersp  precodePublic Class TextStimulusDisplay     Inherits BaseStimulusDisplay      Protected ditherByChanceEffect As PixelShader     Protected psByteCode As ShaderBytecode     Protected gStream As DataStream     Protected ditherBC As Effect      Protected tex As Texture     Protected spriteRender As Sprite      Public displaySettings As DisplaySettings     Public charText As Texture     Public randomText As Texture      Protected rando As Random      Public Sub NewByVal displaysettings As DisplaySettings, Optional ByVal WindowedMode As Boolean  False         MyBase.NewNew Sizedisplaysettings.xResolution, displaysettings.yResolution, WindowedMode         Me.displaySettings  displaysettings     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub CreateDeviceResources         MyBase.CreateDeviceResources         ditherBC  Effect.FromFiledevice, Application.StartupPath amp effectsDitherByChance.fx, ShaderFlags.Debug         rando  New Random          randomText  New Texturedevice, 100, 100, 1, Usage.Dynamic, Format.A32B32G32R32F, Pool.Default         Dim data80000 As Byte         rando.NextBytesdata         Dim dataBox As DataRectangle  randomText.GetSurfaceLevel0.LockRectangleLockFlags.None         dataBox.Data.Seek0, IO.SeekOrigin.Begin         dataBox.Data.Writedata, 0, data.Length         dataBox.Data.Close         randomText.GetSurfaceLevel0.UnlockRectangle          device.SetTexture1, randomText          psByteCode  ShaderBytecode.CompileFromFileApplication.StartupPath amp effectsDitherByChance.fx, DitherByChance, ps20, ShaderFlags.None         ditherByChanceEffect  New PixelShaderdevice, psByteCode         device.PixelShader  ditherByChanceEffect         spriteRender  New Spritedevice         spriteRender.Transform  Matrix.Identity         tex  createCharacterTexture      End Sub      Public Overrides Sub ReleaseDeviceResources         MyBase.ReleaseDeviceResources     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub RenderScene         ditherBC.Technique  ditherBC.GetTechniqueDitherViaChance          Me.device.BeginScene         spriteRender.BeginSpriteFlags.None         ditherBC.Begin         ditherBC.BeginPass0         spriteRender.Drawtex, New Rectangle0, 0, 50, 50, New Color41, 1, 1         spriteRender.DrawrandomText, New Rectangle0, 0, 1000, 1000, New Color41, 1, 1         spriteRender.End         ditherBC.EndPass         ditherBC.End         Me.device.EndScene     End Sub      Public Function createCharacterTexture As Texture         Dim RtsHelper As RenderToSurface  New RenderToSurfacedevice, 100, 100, Format.A32B32G32R32F         Dim texture As Texture  New Texturedevice, 100, 100, 1, Usage.RenderTarget, Format.A32B32G32R32F, Pool.Default          Dim sloanFont As Font  New Fontdevice, 98, 98, FontWeight.Normal, 1, False, CharacterSet.Default, Precision.Default,                                          FontQuality.ClearTypeNatural, PitchAndFamily.Default, Sloan           RtsHelper.BeginScenetexture.GetSurfaceLevel0, New Viewport0, 0, 100, 100            sloanFont.DrawStringNothing, A, 1, 1, New SlimDX.Color4         RtsHelper.EndSceneFilter.None          Font.Dispose         RtsHelper.Dispose          Return texture     End Function End Class codepre

Negative 823 pWe have a longrunning environment with Crystal 9.1 from VS2003 or was it VS.Net  cant remember any more. Weve added new framework versions and used new versions of VS as time goes on, but weve never upgraded the Crystal version. With the simplicity of installing the Crystal 13 that comes with VS2010, however, I persuaded my boss to take a chance on upgrading our apps as we roll out fixesupdates to them. I converted an app from VS2005 and its reports to Crystal 13, installed framework 4.0 and Crystal 13 on our dev server, and all looked good. Then installed same on UAT, and all still looked good. Before I rolled it out to production, however, I had to make some changes to another very large app in a short enough timeframe that I could not upgrade it to VS2010Crystal 13. Now I cant run the 9.1 Crystal reports on the large app in dev, and Im afraid to move it to UAT if I cant even run them in dev. The most annoying part is that Im not even getting an error message  it just doesnt work. I dont emknowem that the addition of Crystal 13 caused the issue, but I made no changes to the report generation in this release and have no other explanation.p  pThe details VS 2008 app with a 9.1 Crystal Report created in the application and exported to a pdf file on local server. I get no errors, but no pdf file ever gets exported or saved. I have confirmed that the user id running the application pool has access to the folder where it should be saved. I have confirmed that creating the report in preview mode in VS2008 and then exporting it from the preview window to that same folder does work. I found several references to running 10.5 with 13, but nothing about 9.1 with 13, and what they mentioned for 10.5 does not seem to apply to 9.1. The servers are running Windows Server 2003 SP2.p  pHas anyone successfully used Crystal 9.1 and Crystal 13 on the same server Im running out of time, yearend freeze is almost upon us, so I have to get these fixes out before including running them through QA and UAT early November or they get delayed to late January and that will NOT make my boss happy.p  pAny and all help greatly appreciated Thanks, Bonniep

Negative 823 pIve already been looking for a solution to this the whole day now. Ive got problems with asmx webservices on a server of a customer. They seem to be deployed properly as I can call the asmx file without problems. Now when I try to invoke a method, absolutely nothing is happening. The IE is not returning an error message or anything like that. Ive added logging mechanisms to the webmethods but they do not log anything, so the method call must be ignored user rights are set correctly.p  pIn order to understand the problem here, Ive deployed both webservices on a test machine. And guess what, they just work fine. I dont know what I am missing here. I hope you have some suggestions. My only guess would be, that somebody must have messed with the IIS config. I even tried to deploy a simple hello world webservice on the server, but no luck as well. I cannot invoke the method.p  pThe services are deployed on a Windows Server 2008 R2, the used .NET Framework is .NET 2.0.

Negative 823 pIm having this problem in JS  which is not my native language at all. I have declared a global variable codevar divID  0code which just is a unique number. There is a button on my HTML page that, when you click it, will add a bunch of stuff to the DOM.p  pSomething likep  precodefunction addStuff    divID   newDiv  document.createElementdiv   newDiv.id  div  divID    Create a bunch more nodes under newDiv    including some button with id newButton  divID   document.getElementByIdsomeDiv.appendChildnewDiv   newButton  divID.clickfunction       do stuff with child nodes of newDiv  divID     codepre  pI hope this makes sense. Basically, each time codeaddStuffcode is called, a block of stuff is added to the DOM. If the user clicks it repeatedly, the same, identical stuff is added over and over, one after another.p  pEach block of stuff that is added has some ID suffix that comes from codedivIDcode, and certain elements in a block have events which affect other elements of the same block. Each block should be selfcontained.p  pHowever, when the user clicks the button twice, to add two blocks  one with ID suffix 1 and one with ID suffix 2, the events for both blocks affect the child elements for the most recently added block always.p  pSo imagine I have 10 blocks of stuff. All events for all blocks that should be selfcontained actually affect the last block, not the block in which they reside.p  pI know this sort of thing happens in C when I spool up threads in a loop and the iterating variable plays some role in the thread bodyp  precodefor int i  0 i lt 10 i    new Threadnew ThreadStartdelegate  Console.WriteLinei .Start  codepre  pWill produce unexpected results  mostly 9s instead of 0 to 9, howeverp  precodefor int i  0 i lt 10 i    int j  i   new Threadnew ThreadStartdelegate  Console.WriteLinej .Start  codepre  pWill work fine.p  pI tried something similar.

Negative 823 pI managed to create a C Server that sends files to AS3AIR Clients using codesocketscode.

I dont want to trigger it on the client, I want the server to do that, i.e, I want to turn on my client and on the server put in what client will get the data.  p  pSo why am I trying to make the client a clientserver Well, because my server is one machine, and my clients are XXX mobile devices that connect the server, and this is my approach to accomplish this.  p  pSo, given what I just said, I managed to create my AS3 clientserver app that works just like I want it, using the codeflash.net.ServerSocketcode library.  p  pFirst I put the client listening  p  precodeserverSocket.bindportNumber, 10.1.1.212 serverSocket.addEventListenerServerSocketConnectEvent.CONNECT, onConnectServer serverSocket.listen codepre  pAnd then I receive the data using the codeflash.net.Socketcode codeEvent.SOCKETDATAcode  p  pAnd thats pretty much it. Works just like I want it to.br However, the codeflash.net.ServerSocketcode is not compatible with mobile devices, yet...  p  pSo heres my problem  I need to send files from C server that needs to listen for clients so I can create a list of connected devices to AS3AIR Clients, but I have to define which client is getting the data on the server, and the clients need to be prepared to receive that data anytime, therefore, listening, but theres a lot of them, thats why I consider them as clients.  p  pAnd my question is  Is there a way to make a client listen for incoming connections and triggering an event when it happens, whithout using the Server Socket in AS3  p  pAlso, if you have a different approach to accomplish my goal whithout using the C server lt AS3 clientserver logic, please feel free to kick in your opinion.p

Negative 823 pI have the following situation I have a big collection of strings lets say 250.000 of average length of maybe 30. What I have to do is to do many searches within these .. mostly those will be of StartsWith and Contains kind. p  pThe collection is static at runtime. Which means the initial reading and filling of the collection of choice is done only once .. therefore the performance of building the datastructure is absolutely not important. Memory is also not a problem which also means that I dont mind having two collections with the same data in each if needed like one for the startswith and another for contains. Only thing that matters is performance of the searches which should return all elements which match the searchcondition. p  pFor startswith I came upon a Trie or Radixtree .. but maybe there are even better choicesp  pFor contains .. I have no good idea yet at all beside running a linq query on a list which wont be very fast with that amount of data.p  pThanks in advance everyonep  pupdate I forgot an important part with Contains i mean no exact matches in the collection .. but i want to find all strings in the collection which contain the given searchstringp

This actually slows down queries because the mysql engine has to check each index to see if it can be used.li ul  pThe two items above are not official, I am just quoting things I have learned in the past. p  pSo which best practice is the better practice Which is more importantp  hr  pEDIT Hopefully an example will help show what I mean. p  pSuppose I have two users Bob userid 10 and jack userid 5. The users want to know how much they have earned from the payments table.p  pFor Bob codeSELECT SUMamount FROM payments WHERE userid10codep  pSince this query is ran a lot for every user, an index is made on the codeuseridcode column which makes this query lightning fast.p  pUsers also earn 5 for referral earnings. Jack is Bobs referral, so he gets 5 of his payments.p  pBobs referral earnings codeSELECT SUMamount.05 FROM payments WHERE referralid10codep  pNote Since multiple users can be Bobs referral, I cannot use the codeuseridcode column.p  pSo, I have two options I can either add another index on codereferralidcode OR I can make another table referralpayments that would store another row with similar info. This table would have an index on codereferralid.codep  pDuplicate this times 10 and you have a situation where I either need to start making new tables or just keep making new indexes even though there is already quite a few.p

Negative 823 pstrongProblem to be solvedstrong Im new to DataBases and Im trying to find out the best way to store changes in a table, that is a daily snapshot of some statuses eg. hotelroomrentals table with 20 columns  every can change. Id like to be able to generate that table for a selected day e.g. data inside changes on production, so I have to store it somewhere else, or do some other transformations on it e.g. average number of days rented in a periodp  pstrongMy theoretical example  detailedstrong Lets say that Im creating a DB for a hotel. In the production system I have a table that shows info for all 10 000 rooms in the hotel. This is a daily snapshot  lets assume that the table is updated once per day.p  pSome attributes of a room change often e.g. isrented customernumber, rateusd. Some attributes dont change too often e.g. disabledroom, roomcolor, typeoffurniture. Roomnumber obviously does not change primary keyp  pNow I want to find the best way to track changes in this table the best way to create statistics on base of this table e.g. average number of days rented in a period and to be able to generate the table for selected date e.g. 20130101p  pstrongMY IDEAstrong Since I have no clue about databases, my idea is to copy the whole table every day, with 1 more column, called DBdumpdate with a date. This is a pretty straightforward approach, which will probably require a lot of space since my 10k rooms table, will have to be copied 365 times in a year.p  pstrongOTHER SOLUTIONSstrong On some other website, I was recommended to create two tables Reservation table with these columns Startdate Enddate Room Rate Occupantname Then to transform this table into a FactReservations table Date Room Isoccupied Rate Occupantname I do not understand how does this help me... in fact I assume I would have to make 20 intermediary tables and then 20 Fact tables since I have 20 columns in my database.p  pstrongQUESTIONSstrong What are the recommended ways to deal with such problems Is there any DB schema that is prepared to deal with it, without the user making magic ETLs e.g. a DB that can optimize the problem by itself What are the alternatives How would you, smart people, do this preferably in MS Access... or some freeware technologyp  pstrongeditstrong one more thing  everything can change in the table, not only room reservetions, everything and I want to be able to track the changesp

Negative 823 pImagine two forms and one grid. Form A consists of comboxes. The boxes show data from database. The user selects the comboboxes and the result is a new record of the grids store. It is also possible to put new valuesrecords into the comboboxes. No database insert Form B consists of several textfields. Its kind of MasterDetail. Grid is Master, Form B is Detail. At the end i want to submit form B and the grids store at one request ajax. At serverside i want to store the detail data and connect them with existing records or even create new records and connect them. I want to run that operations into transaction context.p  pNow i dont know what is goodbest practise. I tried to use the sync method of the grids store and include the form form B values as extraParams. That works, but it is possible that after successfull request i need to do another request with same untouched store only form B changes, so i would have to reset records states. sync performs changes onlyp  pMaybe a simple Ext.ajax.request would to the job, but how to pass the store I can add form B values as param, but i dont know how to add the store Do i need to add every record item to the params config by my own p  pinfo serverside is php, db is mysqlp
Negative 823 pI use the spring data jpa framework to easily handle the whole dao stuff and it is awesome.

I mean those one to one relationships where the data for this type is provides by another json file.p  pHmm I hope it is a bit understandable what I want to do. Did anyone has an idea to handle this with spring data jpap  pThanks for any kind of help and have a good weekend p

Negative 823 pI have a one page site with navigation which allows the user to scroll to the different sections of the page. When the user clicks on a link the hash in the url changes also when the user scrolls the page the hash changes. The only problem I have is if the user is at the top and clicks on the link to go to the footer the hash changes as it skips by the different sections therefore quickly highlighting the navigation links with the selected state before finally reaching the footer.

Negative 823 pI am building an installation package using InstallShield 2012 for an Excel addin. Because MS Excel has 32bit version and 64bit version, I need to build installation packages separately. Ideally, the set up file should be able to detect the Excel bitness not Windows bitness during the first few steps of the installation before files are copied to target machine. However, after some extensive research online, I havent found a reliable way of determining Excel bitness. Anyone with some ideas, please feel free to help. Thanksp

Negative 823 pI have an HTML5 application that uses Azure mobile services authentication to login straight from the example code...provided below. It works fine in all desktop browsers and iPhone 5 in Safari.  But from app  full screen mode, it does nothing doesnt ask for permission to show a popup window like it does in safari and no popup windows shows up and I can wait forever and nothing happens.  If I invoke it a second time, it gives an error saying Error Unexpected failure...perhaps because the 1st attempt is still running  Any helpinsight is appreciated.p  precodeclient.login facebook.donefunction results       alertYou are now logged in as   results.userId , function err       alertError   err  codepre  pstrongedited update with more info and 2 potential ideasstrong p  pI did some more research and found a site that uses an approach that overcomes this problem and also solves two other side effects with the current Azure mobile approach to authentication.  I think the Azure mobile team emmightem be looking to do something similar because there are some hints of other authentication options in the code although difficult to read and be sure because the minimized code is obsfucated.  It might be just a matter of activating these in the code...p  h2The solutionh2  pGo to a hrefhttpm.bcwars.com relnofollowhttpm.bcwars.coma and click on the Facebook login.  Youll see it works perfectly in iPhone Safari in app mode becuase instead of doing a popup, it simply stays in the current browser window. p  pThis approach solves two other problems with the current Azure mobile approach.  First, the popup gets interpreted by most browsers as a potential ad and is either blocked automatically desktop Chrome ... and the user doesnt know why its not working...or gives a warning which the user has to approve iPhone Safari in browser mode which is a hassle.  And if the user has a popup blocker, it gets more difficult and even more potential for the user not getting it to work properly.  The bcwars.com method doesnt have this problem.  p  pSecond, in iPhone Safari, when the popup window auto closes, the original page doesnt get focus if there are other browser windows open in Safari.  Instead, its in the smallerslide mode so they can choose which one to show.  If this happens, the user has to go through one more sttep...click on the browser window to activate it and give it focus..again more of a pain and more potential for them to mess up and not do it correctly and need help.  The m.bcwars.com doesnt have this problem.p  h2Azure optionsh2  pLooking at the Azure mobile code it looks like may already have the solution.  I cant read it easliy becuase its minifiedobsfucated, but it seems to have 4 options including iFrame, etc. for invoking the authentication, and only 1 the less ideal one of a popup is being used.  An easy solution would be to set a property to allow one of the alternate authentications to work.  But I cant read it well enough to figure it out.  Another would be to hack the code temporarily until a fix is put up by Microsoft.  p  pCould I get some help there perhaps  p

Negative 823 pWe have a Ccli library which is performing a number of AD operations unlockpassword setgroup lookup etc this was written with a combination of directoryservicesdirect ldap modifications for password setreset so we could ensure Kerberos auth and directoryservicesacountmanagement for the auth and group membership.p  pOn our dev server all behaves as expected, however moving this to the prod server any operation which is using directoryservices to create an LDAP bind is failing with LDAP error 82. When we run Microsoft network monitor we can see the dev server is using activeds.dll and the failing prod server is using ntdsapi.dll.p  pOur currently thinking is something in the name resolution for the production server as both were failing until we added the domain controller to the hosts file after this was removed the accountmanagement calls continued to succeedp  pDoes anyone know more any detail on the cause of  LDAP 82 local errorp  pWhat would cause the switch between the activeds and ntdsapi libraries at runtimep

Negative 823 pFor development purposes, it would be extremely useful to cap download speeds from localhost. For modern web apps it is important to load stuff dynamically and have things like loaders, progress bars etc. while stuff is downloading, when it comes to implementing this functionality I have to upload the site away from localhost and debug there. Obviously, this is annoying and an inefficient workflow. I was wondering if there are any ways to imitate real life download speeds on a local server, as opposed to having everything load instantly. p  pI am using XAMPP on Windows.p

Negative 823 pI have a database table with about 40,000 records containing code fields, such as FLEFSU25B25M EMG10905Sp  pI need to be able to very quickly select all codes that contain a given substring. For example 109 matches EMG10905S.p  pMy current approach is to store the codes in Lucene and have Lucene filter by substring  such as em109em But that is not very efficient if I just store the codes, because than Lucene has to search through all the tokens.p  pTo overcome this, Im thinking of creating a new analyzer that will split each code into tokens, like this     EMG10905Sbr      MG10905Sbr       G10905Sbr        10905Sbr     ...p  pThen to find all codes with substring 109, I can search on 109 which is much more efficient I understand Lucene stores tokens alphabetically, just like SQL Server indexes.p  pDoes this make sense Does such an analyzer already exist Im using .NetC.p

Negative 823 pI want to deploy a ClickOnce VS app. My problem is that Im using localdb with SMO. For localdb, its easy, I just add it as prerequiste in the propertypublish page. But, SMO is more complex. My first move was to put the dll that I need ConnectionInfo.dll, Management.Sdk.Sfc.dll, Smo.dll and SqlEnum.dll in a folder inside my project and, in the Application Files section, mark them as include, but it doesnt go as good as planned. The app include the dll and works well when I install it, but that end there. I need Microsoft.SqlServer.BatchParserClient.dll to works with the other dll.p  pAfter some research, I realize that I need to install SMO.msi, so it would install BatchParserClient in the GAC. But I would rather want not to install SMO. So, is there a way that I set the BatchParserClient.dll as a dependency to the project and include it in the same as the other dll, even if Im not using it directly in my code. Or is it possible, when installing my app with ClickOnce, to install BatchClientParser in the GAC I read somewhere that no, but I still ask p  pThank you, David LefaivreB.p

Negative 823 pMy project consists of a wheel in which a user can add segments to think of it as a wheel of fortune if you will. These segments can either be of equal weighting or a custom percentage.p  pNow for my problem. I cant figure out an efficient way of adding touch detection so that a user can click a specific segment and edit its properties. I am writing the prototype in XNA so I thought of defining a boundary and checking for any touches within that space. Another method I considered is by calculating the angle from 0 to the touch location and then calculating which segment that would fall in.p  pUnfortunately, thats where I got stuck. If anyone could suggest a more effective method or point me in the right direction in terms of code it would be most appreciated.p

Negative 823 pIm currently struggling with an AJAX related problem on a website.br  The goal is as followsbr  There is a simple HTML page containing some links and content.br p  pIf you click on a link I want to open the file that gets includes with the link from href within a new div overlayed to the page. The content from the page is of course loaded with AJAX into the new div the overlayed one.p  pWithin this new overlayed div I want to add some JS code which in general already works.br  The problem anyway is that the DOM elements within the page loaded per AJAX cannot be accessed in a way that is comfortable to work with, in my specific case.

Notice that the JS also cannot be added to the codeheadcode section because it would not know the elements that are loaded after the domready event.p

Negative 823 pI have two databases, a Master source held locally and a Copy database to be distributed.

Negative 823 pI have a very weird problem. My situation goes as follows I have an app which has a PIN screen implemented. Its nothing hightech just basic 4 codeUITextFieldcodes and implemented logic via codeUITextFieldDelegatecode  it works. p  pIm showing this screen in app delegate on codevoidapplicationWillEnterForegroundUIApplication applicationcode event. I am using codeMMDrawerControllercode from github link a hrefhttpsgithub.commutualmobileMMDrawerController relnofollowhttpsgithub.commutualmobileMMDrawerControllera as the main view controller. If the current view presented when the application enters background and foreground again is this codeMMDrawerControllercode then the codebecomeFirstRespondercode is not working  it doesnt show the keyboard. If there is another view controller presented on top of drawer controller the when entering foreground lets say settings view then keyboard appears normally.p  pI have tried codeNSLogcodeing the codecanBecomeFirstRespondercode property and its set to codeYEScode. What is going on How to fix this This is urgent so please help.p  pI can paste code if needed but its nothing ambiguous. Just plain call codebecomeFirstRespondercode.p  pstrongEDITstrong To explain things a bit more clearly. coderootViewControllercode is a view controller caleed codeLoginViewControllercode and it codeallocinitcodes the sidebar and the center view controllers, codeallocinitcodes the drawer controller and hooks everything up so it works. The app delegate view is actually a PIN screen which pops up when the app enters foreground. Now the keyboard appears like it should for the first time the drawer is visible. When the user pops up codeSettingsViewControllercode yes, this is another view controller accessible from the sidebar view controller it works as well. But when the user dismisses the settings view controller keyboard doesnt appear anymore. It has to do something with the drawer cause I tried without it and it worked but I only had sidebar or center view controller visible. I hope this clears things up a bit. I really need your help on this one guys.p

Negative 823 pI am working on a project where the client wants a way of transitioning between content that basically works like page turning on an ereader app. When you click on a link to go forward, the current content slides to the left and new content is strongrevealedstrong as it slides. If you click on a link to go backwards, the content slides in from the left and is superimposed. If youre jumping to a page further off its fine for the page to reload.p  pThere needs to be a distinct URL for each content block, and ideally this should work all the way down to IE7. Assume there are at least 50 pages, each with at least 2300 words. p  pI know there are lots of jQuery page transition options, but most of the ones that Ive looked at slide in the new content while the old content is sliding off or fades in the new content after the old content is gone think slide.js. What I need is basically curtain.js that is vertical, triggered by a link instead of scrolling, and doesnt need to load in all of the content on the page at once.p  pHeres one way Ive come up with possibly building thisp  ul liCurrent content is loaded in from the database or whateverli liContent for the previous and next pages are also loaded in and stored in hidden divsli liWhen a link is clicked, the current page slides off or the previous page slides inli liThe content thats no longer needed is deletedli liNew content is preloaded with AJAX and hiddenli liLocal URL also changes with AJAXli ul  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comyVvdaUg.jpg relnofollowHeres a crude diagramap  pThat seems really inelegant, though.

Negative 823 pI have a form which will get user information, I am parsing most of the text already. I have set up a [code] tag which will allow users to insert any code they like. Once its submitted, it will have syntax highlighting, etc. The problem I am running into is that when using htmlentities, htmlspecialchars, or similar to sanitize bad input, we get left with some funky looking outputs sometimes from inside the [code] block. I wish for this to look exactly how the user enters it, but to not actually do any actions on the website. For instance, echotest becomes echotest eliminating the highlighting for the string. I wish for this to be displayed exactly as echotest however, it should not execute anything to remain safe.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 823 pI asked a similar question to summarize the directories of files that are ignored under mercurial and got an appropriate answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq19750743781695Summarize all ignored filesdirectories in a mercurial repositorya. p  pHowever, with large projects, the information thrown out by codehg stats icode is still a lot even after filtering to directory level. Is there a tool or smart script that will help me get a high level summary of ignored files. Something that draws out a tree like directory structure with icons indicating which top level folders have ignored stuff. It could be codeexecode or codepyccode files or entire libraries like codedjangocode or codejquerycode that are sitting in my repo but are part of hgignore. p  pIf that doesnt exist, maybe a simple tool that can crossverify that I havent made errors in the globregexp patterns of hgignore i.e. accidentally ignored some crucial file. p

Negative 823 pContextp  pI have created a custom Script control that I use in several of my User Controls these are all loaded via an ASCX path. This Script control provides several interesting features, but I would now like to be able to move the script emoutem of the ASCX markup into the same directory as the ASCX control and then load this markup dynamically. I cannot use normal codeltscriptgtcode tags because the Script control creates a special binding context such that it can be accessed through a clean API.p  pThat, currently my Script control is used like the codeltscriptgtcode elements inside are consumed by the Script control and should not be confused with the final HTML markupp  precodeltSmartScript runatservergt   ltscriptgt the code here ltscriptgt ltSmartScriptgt codepre  pBut I would like it to be usable asp  precodeltSmartScript runatservergt   ltscript srcparenttheCode.js gt ltSmartScriptgt codepre  pHowever, I want parent to be expanded to the emfilesystem locationem of the ASCX control so that I can load the file directly and use that as the contents for the rendered script.p  pThat is, emgiven the ASCXbased user control which can be obtained through the Parent property, how is it possible to determine the system path which houses the ASCX markup fileem And, what caveats should I be aware ofp  pPreferably, this would be the complete path as something like codeCONTROLTEMPLATESprjctrl.ascxcode still leaves another layer of redirect what does the codecode mean here to work through.p  pThe application runs with enough trust to read from the filesystem, and I am avoiding embedded resources so I can push Layout changes without needing to push the DLLs and restart the IIS workers.p

Each day Square on the calendar is going to be a button that, when clicked, will open a popup form displaying the full date and further details. p  pHere is an example of the calendar controlp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comil1V6.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comil1V6.jpgap  pHere is the XAML codep  precode ltButton IsEnabledBinding IsEnabled Click BorderThickness0 ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityAuto BackgroundxNull ForegroundWhite Height72 Width131gt               ltButton.Templategt                 ltControlTemplate TargetTypexType Buttongt                   ltContentPresenter                    VerticalAlignmentCenter                    HorizontalAlignmentLeftgt                     ltContentPresenter.Contentgt                      ltGrid xNameContentGrid HorizontalAlignmentLeft gt                         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                           ltColumnDefinition Width15 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width gt                               ltColumnDefinition Width15 gt                                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                                   ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontal DockPanel.DockTop FlowDirectionRightToLeftgt                                     ltTextBlock TextBinding Date, ConverterStaticResource DateConverter, ConverterParameterDAY  Grid.Column0 VerticalAlignmentTop FontSize14 Margin5,5,5,5 FontWeightLight gt                                        ltTextBlock.Stylegt                                          ltStyle TargetTypexType TextBlockgt                                            ltStyle.Triggersgt                                              ltDataTrigger BindingBinding IsTargetMonth Valuefalsegt                                                ltSetter PropertyTextBlock.Foreground ValueBlackgtltSettergt                                               ltDataTriggergt                                             ltStyle.Triggersgt                                           ltStylegt                                         ltTextBlock.Stylegt                                        ltTextBlockgt                                      ltStackPanelgt                                        ltTextBlock TextBinding Notes, ModeTwoWay, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged Grid.Column2 VerticalAlignmentCenter FontSize14gt                                    ltGridgt                                  ltContentPresenter.Contentgt                                ltContentPresentergt                              ltControlTemplategt                            ltButton.Templategt                         ltButtongt codepre  pAs you can see from the XAML, there is a codeClickEventcode available, but I cant reference another form and cant name the buttons as there will be several, so there is no direct way to reference a method in a class.

Negative 823 pOK, So I know there are tonnes of questions about performing SMTP validation and the vast majority in using PHP or some other script. I have spent 2 days reading through as many as possible but I cannot find quite what I need.p  pSo my question is this Is there a VBA script alternative to these PHP ones that I can use in MS Access 2010 in conjunction with a form, button and a table to perform this SMTP level email validation, which then dumps the replies into another tablep  pP.S. I have already used expression validation to weed out obvious false addresses.p  pEDIT Just in case someone asks, I am doing this to INVALIDATE as many genuine false emails as possible prior to submitting a list of potential valid emails to a 3rd party for further cleansing and updating.p

Negative 823 pIm trying to implement a web prefetching system. The purpose of a system like this is to predict future requests and prefetch them.  p  pThe system builds a predictive model from web navigation logs Squid access.log files. The model is a dependency graph, where a node representing URL A has an arc to a node representing URL B if URL B has been requested immediately after URL A.  p  pOnce the model is built, the system receives queries of URLs requested by users, and make predictions based on the graph. Predictions are resources URLs very likely to be requested in the future. So, based on predictions, the system prefetches these resources to store them in cache prior to users requests.  p  pIm using the following testing scenario  p  ul liA process simulate multiple clients, requesting URLs in a file using libcurl. The process runs in a different PC from the prefetching system. PCs are connected directly via an ethernet cable  li liRequests made by the client simulator are always the same URLs in the same relative time from the first request made. All requests are going to port 3128 Prefetch PC Squid listen port port 80 DNAT to port 3128 in the client.  li liThe prefetching system runs in a CentOS 6.3 box, kernel 2.6.3271.el6.i686, 2 core Intel Pentium 4 3.00GHz processor, 4 GB RAM.  li liThe prefetching system is one process with multiple threads. The main thread creates the predictive model and generates predictions based on queries. A listener thread reads URLs requested by users and prefetches predicted URLs using libcurl. Listening means reading from a named pipe called urlfifo URLs captured live on an interface using tsharkbr codestdbuf o0 tshark i eth1 tcp port 3128 and  tcp[tcp[121] amp 0xf0 gtgt 24]  0x47455420 T fields e http.request.fulluri gtgt urlfifocode   li liEach 10 minutes 1 cycle the model is updated based on requests from the last cycle. The client tells the system when a cycle ends and so the model is updated. Once the model is updated, the system tells the client to start requesting URLs from the next cycle.  li ul  pHere is the situation Sometimes reading from the named pipe freezes. No URLs are read from the pipe even though tshark keeps capturing URLs and redirecting them to the named pipe. After an hour or a couple of hours all buffered URLs are read in less than 10 minutes. After that, reading from the pipe keeps going ok again. This situation doesnt happen always 50 of times freezes, 50 no.  p  pIt seems that there is a buffering issue, since tshark keeps capturing URLs and all requests are correctly logged in Squids access.log.p  pIn the beginning, I ran tshark with the codelcode option, so that its output becomes line buffered. Then I started using codestdbuf o0code no buffering. Anyway the situation still happens. p  pIn the system code, I also tried opening and reading the named pipe as a stream codeFILE code and set the stream as no buffered or line buffered using codesetvbufcode function. The situation still happened.  p  pIn some cycles requests are faster than in other cycles. Anyway, it doesnt seems to be a fast producer slow consumer issue, since in many repetitions of the test all URLs are correctly read and processed without any freezes.  p  pIs there something am I missing related to named pipes and buffering Id really appreciate some guidance.  p  pAssume networking interfaces, routing, iptables, squid is ok. Ive not had any issues related to it.p    pCode assume necessary header files are includedbr functions.cp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodedefine BUFLEN 512 define QUEUELEN 64 define THREADSLEN

Negative 823 pSorry about all of the code, but I am completely new to Visual C and XNA.p  pThis program is out of Learning XNA 4.0 by Aaron Reed. My professor modified some of the stuff its supposed to do the book covers some of this but not all of it. Most of the code is copied from the book.p  pThese are the minimum requirements for the finished productp  ol liYou may use any 2 images in place of 3 Rings and Skull ball or you can still use the same if you wish  one is a player 3 Rings and the other is a participant also called an enemyli liThe player sprite can move only using the Arrow Keys Mouse is not activatedli liThe participant sprites are automated they move freely randomly if you wish and they bounce off the boundaries in any manner you choose toli liAt the beginning of the game there are 1 player and 5 participant spritesli liThe game lasts for exactly 120 seconds, at the end of the game if the player sprite has destroyed all the participant enemy sprites on the screen print a message indicating the player wins otherwise print a message that the player losesli liEvery 10 seconds a new incarnation of an enemy sprite emerges at any locationli liThe player sprite can destroy an enemy sprite only when it collides AND the A key is pressed at the same time. If the A key is pressed without a collision then 2 incarnations of the enemy occursli liThe enemy sprites must move at a reasonable speed not very slow I mean for the game to be meaningfulli liYou need to have some sounds in your program  a background sound that always plays, a sound that plays when an enemy is destroyed, a different sound when the player fires but the enemy does not get destroyed because there was no collision, a sound when a new enemy emerges every 10 secondsli ol  pIm trying to make the enemies skullballs evade the player threerings but the enemies either dont respond on all sides the player is on the right or left and the enemy doesnt evade until the player is above or below, and when the enemies do evade, they disappear offscreen shaking they just suddenly go straight up or down and theyre shaking rapidly. p  pWhen the new enemy spawns after 10 seconds, starting from the topleft corner, it bounces off the bottom wall and then disappears offscreen when it goes back up.p  pThe skull also doesnt spawn randomly around the screen after 10 seconds.p  pAlso I dont know how to make 2 more enemies spawn when the A button is pressed with no

Negative 823 pA third party tool that were forced to use has no standard API. The closest they have is automatically generated webforms which enter stuff into the tools database.

Negative 823 pA function I wrote takes an object as only argument, and naturally I need this object to follow a particular object specification what properties it has, of what type, etc..p  pInstead of passing it as an object literal and do all the checking within the function, I had the idea to write a constructor function to which you pass that literal object, and that does all the job of enforcing the object specification, plus providing default values if necessary.p  pThis function wont be called with codenewcode because it has no need for prototypal inheritance. The return object may include a special property codeisAPointcode in the example to prove that the object was properly constructed a replacement for codeinstanceofcode.p  pI dont remember having seen this kind of approach before. At first sight, it seems a clean way to create valid argument objects, while avoiding the whole mechanism of prototypal inheritance.p  pWhat do you think Is this an identified pattern Could you point me to possible drawbacks and improvementsp  pSimplified examplep  precodevar Point  function opts      use strict     var defaults           color blue,         x 0           opts  .extenddefaults, opts  using jQuerys extend      if isNan x          throw new Errorx must be a number           return          isAPoint true,         color opts.color,         x opts.x       codepre  pCalled like thisp  precodesomeNiceMap.addPointPoint x 2, color red  someNiceMap.addPointPoint x 14  codepre

Negative 823 pI am trying to fix a larger block of code written by previous colleague  it i some sort of report system, output is a table with data.

When I searched questions, how to add vertical scrolling to StackPanel, answers were add ScrollViewer.p  pSo  is there a way, how either make column headers freezed inside the ScrollViewer, or how to enable vertical scrolling in StackPanel without using scrollViewer and another possible solution might be to make the vertical size of StackPanel bit shorter, as there are mostly pages of results, but full page is still required to scroll a bit.p  pXAML partp  precodeltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition Heightgt             ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltTabControl NameMainTab SelectionChangedMainTabSelectionChanged ItemTemplateStaticResource ClosableTabItemTemplategt          ltStackPanel Grid.Row1 NameNavigationPanel OrientationHorizontal HorizontalAlignmentCentergt             ltButton Height23 NameFirstButton Width40 Contentampltamplt ClickPageButtonClick Opacity0.75gt             ltButton Height23 NamePrevButton Width40 ClickPageButtonClick Opacity0.75 Contentampltgt             ltLabel Height23 NamePageNumberLabel Width70 HorizontalContentAlignmentCenter VerticalContentAlignmentCenter Content11gt             ltButton Height23 NameNextButton Width40 Contentgt ClickPageButtonClick Opacity0.75gt             ltButton Height23 NameLastButton Width40 ClickPageButtonClick Opacity0.75 Contentgtgtgt         ltStackPanelgt codepre  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 823 pIm developing a system with a client side and server side database. The problem here concerns synchronisation. Currently my serverside application will generate a hash code based on a models dictionary items, this is computed each time a request is made for data by the client. If the clients code does not match the servers one then it will be sent the data from the server and update its has code with the new server one which is also sent by the server.p  pGenerating the code by hashing all the models items is quite expensive and the problem gets a lot worse with greater amounts of data.p  pI was wondering if instead I could have the server generate a random code and the overload Model.models save and commit functions so they expire the code when anything hits the database.p  pThis scenario leads me to two questions ...is this in fact possible And...  How would I overload the operators so that the default logic is still run after my code has generated a new random token. p

And that WinRT doesnt support XPATH. Now my question is, how would I accomplish the same below with something that will run in a windows store appp  pThe code below does the the following. Downloads the html page from a hrefhttpwww.dubstep.nettrack5436 relnofollowhttpwww.dubstep.nettrack5436a, loops through it looking for href, once it finds a . It takes the href above it and and sends it as a uri to start.p  pi have verified that the code below does work in a console application.p  precode using var client  new WebClient                       Download the HTML             string html  client.DownloadStringhttpwww.dubstep.nettrack5436               Now feed it to HTML Agility Pack             HtmlDocument doc  new HtmlDocument             doc.LoadHtmlhtml             int i  0              Now you could query the DOM.

Negative 823 pIm trying to use an SVG library like Two.js or SVG.js and alter onthefly their dynamically generated SVG elements in order to make them responsive. I have a basic example here, showing how a predefined, inline SVG can be responsive.p  pIt involves wrapping the SVG element in a container, assigning some CSS values, adding  codeviewBoxcode and codepreserveAspectRatiocode attributes. This appears to be the common way to do responsive SVG elementsp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netN4PK4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netN4PK4ap  precodeltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classsvgcontainergt         ltsvg version1.1 viewBox0 0 500 500 preserveAspectRatioxMinYMin meet classsvgcontentgt             ltcircle fillF7941E stroke231F20 strokewidth10 cx250 cy250 r200 opacity1 gt         ltsvggt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  .svgcontainer      display inlineblock     position relative     width 100     outline 1px solid red     paddingbottom 100     verticalalign middle     overflow hidden   .svgcontent      display inlineblock     position absolute     top 0     left 0   .container      maxwidth 400px  codepre  pHowever, when I dynamically generate an SVG element with Two.js, and then I try to use jQuery to edit the DOM and make the SVG element responsive similar to the above example, the SVG element is no longer visiblep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netg5WZj5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netg5WZj5ap  pYou can see that I have two SVGs in that example. The first one is the one that doesnt show up. The second, is the inline, static SVG markup that I copied from what was generated in the first example. So obviously, it is not the markup that is the problem.p  pAlso, here is a similar example using svg.js. Same resultp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3Luaw5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net3Luaw5ap  pSo basically, the problem lies in the fact that if you create a static SVG element in your HTML, then its easy to make it responsive. But if you try to dynamically create an SVG element, its difficult or impossible I dunno to make it responsive.p  pI know that the SVG DOM is kind of different than the normal HTML DOM, so there can be unexpected results when trying to make changes to it dynamically.p  pHow do I overcome this hurdlep

Negative 823 pJust recently started reading about Redis and how it is an extremely fast keyvalue store. It also does a lot under the hood in that it keeps a lot inmemory for caching, but does also write to disk when needed. This is great, but when exactly should it be used. I feel like it might be overkill to use Redis everywhere, but where does it make sensep  pa hrefhttpjimneath.org20110324usingrediswithrubyonrails.html relnofollowhttpjimneath.org20110324usingrediswithrubyonrails.htmlap  pThe link above displayed a great example of a user model using Redis to facilitate User friendships. Now, it seems to me that if I only had 10 users, then I could writep  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase    follow a user   def followuser     redis.multi do       redis.saddself.rediskeyfollowing, user.id       redis.sadduser.rediskeyfollowers, self.id     end   end end codepre  pas followsp  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase    follow a user   def followuser       UserFollower.createuserid gt self.id, following gt user.id UserFollower is jointable   end end codepre  pI imagine that if I have a few users there is virtually no difference. Im assuming if I had 1,000,000 I might start to notice the difference. I dont know exactly how Redis knows when to persist this data, but are the benefits essentially its cache So I dont have to query the DB anymore and could just have Redis fetch it for me because it is inmemoryp  pIf user 1 follows someone and it gets stored in Redis, after which their session with the server is finished until their next request, does that information stay in Redis so that if another user, say user 2, does something that gets this info, will it be a query to the DB or would it be from Redisp  pI could definitely see the plus side of this as a keyvalue store that is caching and being used among multiple users at once through their various requests and also to reduce queries in general, but is that it Im not exactly sure how Redis works, but from what Ive read that is the impression I got.p

However, I want to change the scale between the x and y axes, ie I want to zoom in more on the xaxis. so in the example, the square would be mapped to a rectangle under the inset map.p  pHow do I achieve thisp  pHere is a working examplep  precodeimport pylab as pl import numpy as np from mpltoolkits.axesgrid1.insetlocator import zoomedinsetaxes from mpltoolkits.axesgrid1.insetlocator import markinset  xnp.linspace0,1,100 yx2  axpl.subplot1,1,1 ax.plotx,y  axins  zoomedinsetaxesax, 1, loc2,bboxtoanchor0.2, 0.55,bboxtransformax.figure.transFigure  zoom  6    axins.plotx,y  x1, x2 .4, .6 y1,y2  x12,x22 axins.setxlimx1, x2 axins.setylimy1, y2 markinsetax, axins, loc11, loc23, fcnone, ec0.5 pl.show codepre  pSo what I want to do is to be able to change the width and height of the inset separately, without changing the x and y ranges of the inset.p
Negative 823 pI have an object that I would like to create. This object is composed of other objects that I dont want the client class to be responsible for creating. There are lots of validation rules that must pass before the object can be created.p  pSo I would like to abstract away the creation of this complex object into a emfactoryem class. I have 2 questions really, the first is purely about semanticsp  ol liWhat should I call the class which is creating my object The a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAbstractfactorypattern relnofollowfactory methoda pattern and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAbstractfactorypattern relnofollowabstract factorya pattern are both related to abstracting away creation of concrete classes of emdifferent typesem. However, Im creating an object of a single type, so using the term emfactoryem might be confusingli liIs this an appropriate solution Are there any patternsexamples of this being doneli ol  pThanks in advance for any helpguidance.p

Negative 823 pI have been trying to understand how ACO optimization can be implemented with data parallelism. I have read some content after searching in Google. I only need the basic idea in simple way. Most of the papers are talking about everything else instead of the main thing in simple words.p  pWhat I understood so far is, we will make it work parallel by using multitaskingthreading. But am not sure what each thread would do or how we could separate it into threads without causing trouble. p  pDoes it means that we should create separate thread for each ants But that would cause lots of threads to be created So if there are 200 ants, then 200 threads p  pAm still having confusion at this data parallelism topic in ACO. I would really love to hear in simple words on how we would implement it parallely.p

Lets say, I have three classes, codeVehiclecode, codeMotorizedVehiclecode and codeFlyingMotorizedVehiclecode as well as a bunch of classes codeAirplanecode, codeHelicoptercode, ...p  precodepublic abstract class Vehicle       abstract Something doStuff...      abstract SomethingElse doOtherStuff...      abstract Foo bar...    public class MotorizedVehicle extends Vehicle       Override     Something doStuff...          return new Something           Override     SomethingElse doOtherStuff...          return new SomethingElse           Override     Foo bar...          return new Foo         public class FlyingMotorizedVehicle extends MotorizedVehicle       Override     SomethingElse doOtherStuff...          return new SomethingElse         public class Airplane extends FlyingMotorizedVehicle        Override     Foo bar...          do something different         return new Foo         public class Helicopter extends FlyingMotorizedVehicle       Override     Foo bar...          do something totally different         return new Foo        [...] codepre  pSo codeVehiclecode is an abstract class providing some abstract methods. codeMotorizedVehiclecode is a subclass of codeVehiclecode with concrete implementations of its methods. codeFlyingMotorizedVehiclecode again is a subclass of codeMotorizedVehiclecode overriding the implementations of a subset of codeMotorizedVehiclecodes methods.p  pNow there are the subclasses codeHelicoptercode, codeAirplanecode and potentially some others which in the example override the concrete implemenatation of codeMotorizedVehiclebar...code. What I want is to force every subclass of codeMotorizedVehiclecode to have to override the codebar...code method and provide its own implementation.p  pIs it possible to just change the codeFlyingMotorizedVehiclecode in the following wayp  precodepublic class FlyingMotorizedVehicle extends MotorizedVehicle       Override     SomethingElse doOtherStuff...          return new SomethingElse           abstract Foo bar...   codepre  pSo that I just redefine the codebar...code as abstract method My IDE is not complaining about it, but that of course does not mean, that it will actually work.p  pI hope you get what I try to point out here.p  pThanks in advancep  pBluddy p

Negative 823 pI am writing a class in Python and part of the code deals with a server.

Negative 823 pI am refreshing my memory on OOP and learning how to apply it to PHP with a focus on separation of concerns MVC.  For practice, I found and edited some code online.  The function emqueryem returns data from my MySQL database.

Ive researched this endlessly, but havent found anything specific to what Im trying to do.  Normally, I would assign the method call to a variable and then manipulate or display the variable as needed.  This does not appear to be an option in this case.  I tried assigning the query in the method call to an array variable and also using a foreach method to display the results.  So far nothing has worked.p

Negative 823 pI have been working on an app where there are 3 activities lets say A, B, Cp  ol liA calls B using StartActivitytypeofBli liB calls C using StartActivitytypeofC and finish itself using this.finishli liC has a full screen EditText inside a LinearLayout. C has also overridden OnBackPressed where it calls this.finish to complete itself and navigates back to A [as A is still in the BackStack]. Inside OnCreate Method of C, EventHandlers of EditText have been added TextChanged event and KeyPressed Event like belowli ol  precodepublic void OnCreateBundle SavedInstanceBundle       base.OnCreateSavedInstanceBundle     SetContentViewResource.Layout.EditTextLayout     EditText editText  FindViewByIdltEditTextgtResource.Id.editText     ADDING EVENT HANDLERS FOR EDITTEXTS TEXTCHANGED AND KEYPRESSED EVENTS     editText.TextChanged  editTextTextChanged     editText.KeyPressed  editTextKeyPressed   private void editTextTextChanged object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e    private void editTextKeyPressed object sender, View.KeyEventArgs e    public override void OnBackPressed       base.OnBackPressed     this.finish  codepre  pThe problem here is that when the eventhandler code exist, the OnBackPressed is never executed when Hardware back is pressed. But, when the adding event handler code is removed for both the event, eventually OnBackPressed starts working properly.p

Negative 823 pI am currently developing some security code. This code has a specific algorithm that may not be changed.br If someone were to decompile my code they were easily able to recreate the code and reverse engeneer it so that the person would be able to bypass that code. Even if it was obfuscated.br I talked about this problem with a friend who suggested that I add some pointless operations. Something likep  precodevar1  1 var1  1 codepre  pBut I need some methods that are not easy to understand and the should not be very compution power consuming.br I am mostly working with long values so a few operation for Java long values would be really usefull.p  h3As requestedh3  pThe environment are linux systems. The systems themselves are secure but there is a chance that someone might be able to get the compiled code.p  pThe code will be used the authentificate a client. The server and the clients will use the same code. The main purpose of the code is the generate a authentification key that will be unique to every client and that will change frequently.p  pThe algorithm has not been designed by me. I am simply the only one that can program it properly.p  pThe job of the algorithm is basically to generate something like a hash. It uses several different inputs Some of which are static and some of which change frequently and then returns a String containing a hash the client will use to authentificate. The communication itself is secured with SSL. So a potential attacker would need to have to obtain the binary itself. Also some of the changing inputs are inside of the binary and some are not.p  pI am aware that obfuscation will not stop every attacker but I am sure if there is a decent obfuscation that most attackers will loose interest.br I know this for sure since we get attacked quite frequently by some beginner hackers. Most of them barley even know Java and some are good enough to read simple obfuscated code. And these are the one we are trying to stop from understanding our algorithm. I cannot give more details about the algorithm itself. For security reasons obviously.br The algorithm uses many longs. And I think it would really add a lot of time to the process of RE if there is tons of pointless code. I hope this descibes the environment and the algorithm itself enough. If not please ask more specific questionsp

But i do not calculate largest number for every entry since it is costly.p  pSo what should i do nowp  pI ve searched and the solutions i found creating trigger function etc. i do not want to do that too. p

Negative 823 pI have some .m4a files that were captured from a radio broadcast stream. They are playable using strongmpdstrong an open source Music Playing Daemon for nix, but iTunes wont open them nor will several other music players that should be able to play .m4a files. When I looked at the file in hex format, and compared it to an .m4a file from iTunes, it appeared that the file from the broadcast stream did not have any header info.p  pSo I figured Id try prepending some header info to the file, to see if that would make it playable by these other players.p  pIve tried to read the technical doc about the .m4a file format to understand how the header is structured, but its far too complex for me to follow most of the doc is about the coding, which isnt pertinent to this. The header seems fairly simple, conceptually  I can see 4character tags, variable length data, and there are presumably some length codes to allow these to be split apart. It emdoesntem seem to contain any significant data about the actual audio data like its total length, making me hopeful that I might be able to get by by simply copying the header from an .m4a file and prepending it to these headerless files.p  pIm unable, though, to manually parse that is, reverseengineer the header in order to even experiment with this. Can someone describe how to identify a complete header at the front of a .m4a file p

Negative 823 pIve inherited an old VB6 DLL to control industrial machinery.  Ive converted it to C.   It works well except for one feature  the VB6 version supported an asynchronous model via a timer that woke up every second to update some machinery and update a big set of data structures and global variables.       It got away with this because VB6 was really single threaded even though it could simulate asynchronousness by queing events to execute between subroutine calls or via DoEvents.p  pIn C we have real asynchronous processing because the strongSystem.Timers.Timerstrong Im using results in a new thread being run.   Unfortunately this means that we get threading collisions as the timer thread tries to manipulate items that are also being touched by the users application thread.p  pstrongCaveatstrong  The data being manipulated by the timer thread is large and varied  hundreds of different data structures, variables and flags that are used all over the other DLL calls, so its not practical to make just a few critical sections to protect it.p  pIdeally it would be easiest to move the work of the timer code into a call that would run in the application thread and just use the timer to somehow trigger this.   But howp  pOur test application for this DLL emhappensem to be a WPF program, so potentially we could use some sort of DispatchTimer thread to solve this emin our test caseem, but we have no basis to assume that the users applications are Dispatcherbased, so its not a universal solution.p

Negative 823 pHeres the problem. Let it be known that Im very new to Haskell and the declarative language part is totally different from what Im used to. Ive made a database of sorts, and the user can input commands like Add User emNameem or Create Table Funding. Im trying to create a function that takes as parameters a list of commands, a User, a Table, a Column name as a string, and returns a list containing the values in that column if the user has access to them i.e. somewhere in the list of commands there is one that matches Allow User emnameem Table Funds. We can assume the table exists.p  precode    module Database where  type Column  String data User  User String deriving Eq, Show data Table  Table String deriving Eq, Show data Command      Add User    Create Table    Allow User, Table    Insert Table, [Column, Integer]   deriving Eq, Show    Useful function for retrieving a value from a list  of label, value pairs.  lookup  Column gt [Column, Integer] gt Integer lookup c c,icvs  if c  c then i else lookup c cvs  lookupColumn  [Column, Integer] gt [Integer] lookupColumn c, icvs  if null cvs then [i] else [i]  lookupColumn cvs   select  [Command] gt User gt Table gt Column gt Maybe [Integer] select a b c d  if not elem b, c [g, h  Allow g, h lt a]   then Nothing   else Just lookupColumn [d, x  Insert c, [ d, x ,  ] lt a] codepre  pI have gotten it to work, but only in very select cases. Right now, the format of the input has to be such that the column we want the values from must be the first column in the table. Example input is below.

Right now, its only matching the first column, but Id like it to work with any number of columns, not knowing which column the user wants ahead of time. p  pcode[d, x  Insert c, [ d, x ,  ] lt a]code returns a list of tuples that match only the first tuple in each list of Column, Integer tuples.p  pcodelookupColumncode takes in a list of tuples and returns a list of the integers within it. Unlike codelookupcode, we know that the list this takes in has only the correct columns Column, Integer tuples within it. codelookupcode can take in a list of any number of tuples, but must check if the column names match first.p  pAny help at all would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 823 pIm developing a largely CRUD based web application. It is multitenanted. 2 of its entities need to be available offline.p  pIf it was not offline I would use a RESTful url architecture for the urls, such as action5edit, action, farmer3view etc. However based on this a hrefhttpalistapart.comarticleapplicationcacheisadouchebag relnofollowarticlea I would need to create a very long cache manifest for all actions and farmers that this user is allowed to access and I dont know how I would add newly created actions to this manifest. Each manifest file would also have to change for each user.p  pI want to however retain the ability for a super user to edit multiple items in the same browser at the same time and I want to be able to bookmark and link to specific entities.p  pTo achieve this, Im planning to serve the offline capability from one single url and use url parameters to create bookmarkable links.p  pWhile the offline functionality will load all data in any case if online, the javascript inside will pick up the url parameters to load the correct entity and if other entities are accessed  i.e. pseudonavigated to, it will change the url in the browser.p  pI would like to know any way I can achieve this easier, or any improvements that could be made to this architecture.p

The problem is, I have to call the completionHandler and report whether any new data was available or not. If i return codeUIBackgroundFetchResultNoDatacode, the iOS might, after a while, decide to stop calling codeperformFetchWithCompletionHandlercode.

Negative 823 h2Here is what I found after investigating cache behavior in Magento.h2  h2 Im emnotem sure of this and asking for correction.h2  pWhen something like a product is modified, cache entries such as HTML Block becomes invalidated, resulting on being ignored and not used in frontend. This makes sense because these data is now outdated.p  pIt remains invalidated until manually refreshed through admin area.p  pOnce manually refreshed, the first render of a cached block will construct its cached copy and emappendem it to this HTML Block cache reserve. Subsequent render operation of this block will find this cache usable, and use it, finally, until cache becomes invalidated over again.p  pWhy this process is called refresh, as it should be something like reset because refresh would means it generate updated cache snapshot, but instead it merely allows cache entries to be constructed.p  pWhy dont invalidated data become refreshed once its invalidatedp  pThis makes me question my conclusion, was I correctp
Negative 823 pI am trying to add a UIViewController that contains a simple UITableView to a container view controller by calling self.addChildViewControllerchild.

Negative 823 pIm making a snake gamea hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSnake28videogame29 relnofollowfor those who dont knowa where the snake is controlled by an AI using different algorithms to catch the food. The difference with the regular game is that the snake doesnt move unless a command has been sent by the AI.p  pMy problem is that as soon as I run the AI, the AI creates a stack of commands to be executed to catch the food but my GUI just freezes probably because it cant keep up with the amount of repaints that the move stacks cause. Through console logs, I can see that AI and the game logic is still running.p  pI tried to do codeThread.sleepcode after each move but I guess this just makes the entire program including the GUI sleep.

Negative 823 pI am investigating performance hotspots in an application which spends 50 of its time in memmove3. The application inserts millions of 4byte integers into sorted arrays, and uses memmove to shift the data to the right in order to make space for the inserted value.p  pMy expectation was that copying memory is extremely fast, and I was surprised that so much time is spent in memmove. But then I had the idea that memmove is slow because its moving overlapping regions, which must be implemented in a tight loop, instead of copying large pages of memory. I wrote a small microbenchmark to find out whether there was a performance difference between memcpy and memmove, expecting memcpy to win hands down.p  pI ran my benchmark on two machines core i5, core i7 and saw that memmove is actually faster than memcpy, on the older core i7 even nearly twice as fast Now I am looking for explanations.p  pHere is my benchmark. It copies 100 mb with memcpy, and then moves about 100 mb with memmove source and destination are overlapping. Various distances for source and destination are tried.

But initially when the tiles are created they are eventually goes outside until I clicks and drag them inside of parent.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8 gt     lttitlegtDashboardlttitlegt      ltlink hrefcssjqueryuijqueryui.min.css relstylesheet gt      ltstyle typetextcssgt         .statsTile                      minwidth 180px             width 180px             minheight 180px             height 180px             padding 0.5em             background white             position fixed important                       .statsTile h4                              textalign center                 margin 0                       container                      width 800px             height 500px             background 666666             float left               ltstylegt      ltscript srcscriptsjqueryjquery2.1.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcscriptsjqueryuijqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          function               wrapper container .uiwidgetcontent.statsTile.draggable                 cursor move,                 containment parent                           wrapper container .uiwidgetcontent.statsTile.resizable                 containment parent                            ltscriptgt  ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idwrappergt         ltdiv idcontainergt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtCall Abbondanedlth4gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtAbbondaned lth4gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtAverage Ring Timelth4gt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classuiwidgetcontent statsTilegt                 lth4 classuiwidgetheadergtCall Answeredlth4gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 823 pThis should be pretty straight forward, but it appears I need to reach out and ask if others have encountered this...p  pIve got a project on xcode 6 thats targeting iOS 7.  Im using a storyboard and codeautolayoutcode.  Ive created a codeUIViewControllercode, dropped on a codeUITableViewcode, and on that codeUITableViewcode Ive dropped on 3 different prototype cells, each with varying height. Each proto cell has its own codeUITableViewCellcode class, with codeUIElementcode linked accordingly.p  pThese proto cells are designed in the GUI editor of the storyboard, and each of them have a fixed height.  The will never grow in height like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18746929usingautolayoutinuitableviewfordynamiccelllayoutsvariablerowheightsUsing Auto Layout in UITableView for dynamic cell layouts amp variable row heightsap  pThe problem with all examples I keep finding is that they all use a single prototype cell, and vary the height based on the content i.e. theyre using a codeUITextViewcode and sizing the cell height based on how much text in in the view.p  pSince my proto cells are already designed in the storyboard, and they will never exceed their design height with dynamic content, all I want to do is show them as they are designed, when they are added to the table.p  pIm using a switch statement in the codecellForRowAtindexPathcode to determine which codeUITableViewCellcode class to use based on codeindexPath.rowcode.p  pI created some dummy data in an array and use it to build a table with 3 rows, to see each of the 3 types of cells being rendered in the table.p  pThis all works perfectly on iOS8. On iOS7, however, all three of my cells visually end up piled on top of each other.p  pFor grins, I then implemented a codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode method, and simply use a switch to determine what codeindexPath.rowcode Im dealing with, and then return back the height of the prototype cell from the dimensions shown in the storyboard designer.  This was supposed to be a simple, hardcoded approach to see if codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode was needed to solve the issue.p  pAgain, works great on iOS 8, but on iOS7 all 3 cells are piled on top of each other.p  pI guess a basic question is since Im using storyboarddesigned prototype cells, that have fixed sizes and constraints on all of the codeUIComponentcode within those proto cells, why doesnt this work on iOS 7p  pIm trying to avoid adding tons of code just make this work on iOS7.p

When N is set to 1000, this test fails approximately 3 times out of 5 on my machine, with actual result being smaller than expected. When N is 100 and below  it never fails, or at least I never saw it fail.p  pWhy does this program ever fail at all This is obviously very inefficient approach, with too big overhead for threads management, but it should always work correctly at least, right There is either some subtle bug that I do not see or some threading concept I do not understand.p  pAlso, I am not looking for a better way to solve this particular problem, or for a better way to illustrate the same concept. I am just trying to figure out why this particular approach fails sometimes.p

Negative 823 pI am developing a DWH on Oracle 11g. We have some big tables 250 million rows, partitioned by value. Each partition is a assigned to a different feeding source, and every partition is independent from others, so they can be loaded and processed concurrently.p  pData distribution is very uneven, we have partition with millions rows, and partitions with not more than a hundred rows, but I didnt choose the partitioning scheme, and by the way I cant change it.p  pConsidered the data volume, we must assure that every partition has always uptodate statistics, because if the subsequent elaborations dont have an optimal access to the data, they will last forever.p  pSo for each concurrent ETL thread, wep  ol liTruncate the partitionli liLoad data from staging area with li ol  pcodeSELECT  APPEND  INTO bigtable PARTITIONpart1 FROM temptable WHERE partitioncolum  PART1codep  pthis way we have direct path and we dont lock the whole tablep  ol start3 liWe gather statistics for the modified partition.li ol  pIn the first stage of the project, we used the codeAPPROXGLOBALANDPARTITIONcode strategy and worked like a charmp  precode dbmsstats.gathertablestatsownnamegtmyschema,                               tabnamegtbigtable,                               partnamegtpart1,                               estimatepercentgt1,                               granularitygtAPPROXGLOBALANDPARTITION,                               CASCADEgtdbmsstats.autocascade,                               degreegtdbmsstats.autodegree  codepre  pBut, we had the drawback that, when we loaded a small partition, the APPROXGLOBAL part was dominant still a lot faster than GLOBAL , and for a small partition we had, e.g., 10 seconds of loading, and 20 minutes of statistics.p  pSo we have been suggested to switch to the strongINCREMENTAL STATSstrong feature of 11g, which means that you dont specify the partition you have modified, you leave all parameters in auto, and Oracle does its magic, automatically understanding which partitions have been touched. And it actually works, we have really speeded up the small partition. After turning on the feature, the call becamep  precode dbmsstats.gathertablestatsownnamegtmyschema,                               tabnamegtbigtable,                               estimatepercentgtdbmsstats.autosamplesize,                               granularitygtAUTO,                               CASCADEgtdbmsstats.autocascade,                               degreegtdbmsstats.autodegree  codepre  pnotice, that you dont pass the partition anymore, and you dont specify a sample percent.p  pBut, were having a drawback, maybe even worse that the previous one, and this is correlated with the high level of parallelism we have.p  pLets say we have 2 big partition that starts at the same time, they will finish the load phase almost at the same time too. p  ol lipThe first thread ends the insert statement, commits, and launches the stats gathering. The stats procedure notices there are 2 partition modified this is correct, one is full and the second is truncated, with a transaction in progress, updates correctly the stats for both the partitions.pli lipEventually the second partition ends, gather the stats, it see all partition already updated, and does nothing this is NOT correct, because the second thread committed the data in the meanwhile.pli ol  pThe result isp  precodePARTITION NAME  LAST ANALYZED         NUM ROWS  BLOCKS  SAMPLE SIZE  PART1           04MAR2015 154042  805731    20314   805731 PART2           04MAR2015 154148  0         16234   null codepre  pand the consequence is that I occasionally incur in not optimal plans which mean killing the session, refresh manually the stats, manually launch the precess again.p  pI tried even putting an exclusive lock on the gathering, so no more than one thread can gather stats on the same table at once, but nothing changed.p  pIMHO this is an odd behaviour, because the stats procedure, the second time it is invoked, should check for the last commit on the second partition, and should see its newer than the last stats gathering time. But seems its not happening.p  pAm I doing something wrong Is it an Oracle bug How can I guarantee that all stats are always uptodate with incremental stats feature turned on, and an high level of concurrencyp

As this is codepositionfixedcode its taken out of the flow, and as such the issue is that it overlaps the bottom of the page. To fix this Ive added this code which creates some space after the body tagp  precodebodyafter    content   displayblock   height52px   width100  codepre  pThis works well, but when testing with different themes I noticed for some reason on some of them the codeltbodygtcode tag is collapsed, it has no height whatsoever. As a result the codebodyaftercode is right at the top and not doing its job adding a space at the bottom. My thoughts are to fix this is to get the codeltbodygtcode tag to expand and contain its children, that however seems easier said than done.p  pNearly all the suggestions Ive seen say thisp  precodehtml  height100  body  height100 minheight100  codepre  pCurrently on this theme the codelthtmlgtcode element is fine, and contains the whole page 838px height but if I add codehtml  height100 code it goes to the height of the viewport. But without adding that the codebody  height100 code code does nothing.p  pThere are a tonne of questions out there about expanding the codeltbodygtcode to fit the viewport, but Ive not found anything that solves this yet. Totally happy to be proven wrong as Im sure its addressed somewhere but after a couple of hours of head banging and no light at the end of the tunnel Ive resorted to asking here.p
Negative 823 pI am building an RSS feed reader miniproject. There are two channels of feed that im supposed to get feed data out of. One feed channel collects RSS data in the form of xml while the other one in JSON. The BNR feed is based on the former type and Apple trailers feed on the latter one. In order to lay out both types of RSS feeds info in a listlike fashion i have used a tableviewcontroller for each one so every feed is a tableviewcell. Either of the types can be accessed through their respective UISegmentedButton on top in the UINavItem area. I have done all the work to get the basic functionality. Now i have to add a feedCountTuner for manipulating the feedcount for Apple Trailers RSS feeds. In doing so, i am basically having the app to add and remove tableviewcells dynamically for each of them represents an RSS feed.p  pI have attempted this by using a uislider to control the feed count for Apple trailers RSS. Please note that Im building this solution against iOS 78 so i havent used a uitoolbar to do the job as they arent that popular in post iOS 6 world. I have setup the uislider in a custom tableviewcell and hooked all the targetaction connections appropriately. Plus i placed a uilabel right beside it which displays the feed count appropriately as the sliders thumb is moved. I used the ListViewController as an indirect files owner of the custom cell so that the former is now the viewcontroller for the latter. I relayed the action message for the added UISlider off to the ListViewController and wrote the uislider action logic in a private action method in the same. Moreover, i set the customcell with the uislider and the label in a separate section from the feed cells section so that the former is in section0 while the latter is in section1.

The user will press kbdenterkbd for all the horses to advance. Every time kbdenterkbd is pressed you will generate a random number between 1 and 3 for each of the ten horses, this will be the amount of spaces that the horse will move forward. That number will be added to the previous number that the horse had. The first horse to get to 15 will be the winner. Your program should stop after a horse wins. On each iteration you will display the location of each horse.p  precodeWHEN THE USER HITS ENTER NUMBERS ARE ADDED TO PREVIOUSLY GENERATED NUMBERS FIRST HORSE TO FIFTEEN WINS IM LOST          import java.util. import java.text. import java.util.Random    public class HorseRace       public static void mainString[ ] arg          final int ONE  10          final int TWO  10          int count  0          int i  0 position          String[ ] sWords  new String[ONE]          String sONEWord          Scanner sc  new ScannerSystem.in          System.out.printlnHit enter to begin race          sc.nextLine       Random ran  new Random  generates random number       int[ ] arrRan1  new int[ONE] populating the array one number at the time          forint a  0 altarrRan1.length a          arrRan1[a]  ran.nextInt3  1 number from 1 to 3, then add 1                    boolean exit  false       whilecount lt ONE forint a  0 altarrRan1.length a             System.out.printlnHorse  i1     arrRan1[a]             i  i 1                      System.out.printPress Enter key to continue          sc.nextLine       Random ass  new Random  generates random number       forint b  0 bltarrRan1.length b          int a  0          arrRan1[b]  ran.nextInt3  1 number from 1 to 3, then add 1                    boolean exit2  false       whilecount lt TWO forint b  0 bltarrRan1.length b             System.out.printlnHorse  count1     arrRan1[b]             count  count 1                                                                      main    class codepre

Negative 823 pIm pretty new to PHP and am trying to learn more in the area of making my forms secure so that my DB are more difficult to mess up via SQL injection and such.

Negative 823 pI have a 64bit .NET process that runs for days. The process consumes a native 32bit COM server using DCOM. Once in a while the COM server runs out of memory because the .NET process garbage collector only sees the RCWs of the COM objects and those are quite lightweight and not worth collecting. I need to somehow make garbage collector aware of those COM objects.p  pFor the record, I tried to run the same code periodically forcestarting garbage collection and the problem goes away so the problem is not a leak of some kind, just objects not collected fast enough.p  pYes, I know theres codeGC.AddMemoryPressurecode which allows to tell the garbage collector that were now consuming more memory. The problem is the 64bit .NET process may treat that as not a big deal  its 64bit and well, gigabyte here and another gigabyte there  who cares but the 32bit process where the objects actually live is much more sensitive to those allocations.p  pSo what may be a no big deal for a 64bit process is surely a big deal for a 32bit process and I need to somehow make the garbage collector of the 64bit process be more sensitive to amount of memory used by another process.p  pHow can I handle this situation so that the 64bit process timely collects the RCWs and the 32bit COM server doesnt run out of memoryp

Negative 823 pI am trying to use Database.Persistant to make a database for a Scotty app, and I cannot figure out the syntax for adding a foreign key constraint between tables. For example, I have a codeUsercode table and a codePostcode table, and I want the codePostcode table to have an attribute codeauthorIdcode which references codeUserIdcode in codeUsercode. This can be accomplished quite easily in raw SQL, but I want to be able to access the data through haskell without resorting to raw sql commands. Also, the constraints would be overwritting upon database migrations.

Just a caveat I thought that skipnameresolve solved the issue but it seems to just have lowered the frequency. Hope someone would help me out this time around.p  pstrongEDITstrong The MySQL guys say that in a client server setup server may close a connection if it is unused for a long time. However, this is not what I am facing as I create a new connection everytime I want to execute a query. I made this point clear in the last comment on the MySQL Bugs.p

Negative 823 pWe have a number of tests, many of them have shared spring context, but generally we have a few of them specific for given tests. When due to some changes some context fails to load TestNG skips all tests starting from this point. The problem is it is not only skipping given test file, or tests for given spring context, it skips all further tests, and we have to fix one in order to know which ones has to be checked yet.p  pAny ideas how to prevent TestNG from skipping whole suite when only few files has failed while setting contextp

Negative 823 pI have a codeUITableViewcode with custom cells. Each cell has a rather complex layout and a lot of child views all of which has event actions codeUIImageViewcode with gesture recogniser, several codeUIButtonscode with some actions, two codeUILabelcodes with gesture recognizers. So Im interested are there some elegant ways to handle targetaction for them Now I see three ways p  ol liHandle actions with blocks codeBlocksKitcode to the rescue right in the codecellForRowAtIndexPathcodeli liCreate custom class codeCellEventHandlercode, pass to it all needed dependencies controllers codenavigation controllercode, data array, etc. and place all the cells views action selectors there.li liWrite all the selectors in the TableViewController default wayli ol  pp But Im not satisfied with all this ways. Can someone describe some elegant way which will help to make controller thin, and also will be easy maintainble. Im sure there should exist some pattern for this workflow.p

Negative 823 pThe default keyboard provided with Googles LeanBack Launcher for Android TV STBs allows for navigation and selection of keys on the keyboard using DPAD buttons.

Negative 823 pOk so I was watching a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvu2okVLCrqgEampt2h14m18s relnofollowa YouTube video about Angularjsa and on one of the lines of code, they were using two filters. It went something like thisp  precodeltdiv ngrepeatitem in event.events  orderBy date  limitTo 2 ...gt codepre  pMy only question is on the order of operations here. This question is NOT about the difference between sorting and then limiting the list of items versus limiting the items first and then sorting them. For further clarification, the question is more about stronghow angular implements this and whether it does any optimizationstrong, so one can decide how to use these filters more effectively. It seems that sorting a list of 100 and then cutting it down to two elements is extremely inefficient when you could maybe outside of angular or with a custom filter find the most recent items, but stop looking when you get to the number of items you want displayed. p  pIn angulars default behavior with the above code, is the entire list of events sorted by date before being cut down to two or does angular do some internal optimization to make this more efficient Or would one have to make a custom filter to achieve this optimization p

Negative 823 pHere, I am developing a project with java sockets and I have a problem with the implementation of the correct time synchronization between Server and Client. I am going to describe the problem with a simple examplep  pstrongServerstrong runs on GMT and keeps a database with various items. Some of those items are on special offer, but these offers have a time limit before they expire.br So lets say that strongemserver timeemstrong now is strong900AMGMTstrong and there is an offer item ending at strong1000AMGMTstrong.p  pstrongClientstrong may be on a different time and timezone than the server. So lets say that client time now is strong800AMGMT1strong, I can take the time and adjust it to clients timezone and find that it ends at strong900AMGMT1strong ie in 1 hour.p  pstrongProblemstrong How do I calculate the time remaining when a user has a custom time set. br For example, the above client sets the clock manually to be half an hour ahead, ie strong830AMGMT1strong. If you just do the timezone conversion the item would still be ending at strong900GMT1strong, so the time left for the offer to finish is wrong 30mins.p  pOne may say that a possible solution would be to set the client to ask the time left in seconds from the server instead of the exact date ending. But I want to implement something like a count down of seconds in the client side. If offer ends in 60 seconds, the interface would go 60,59,58,..,1,0. So sending a request strongevery secondstrong to the server to get the time left is not be network efficient.p  pOne more thing that worries me is that if you do go with the scenario of requesting the time left in seconds, on slow network the response from server will not come instantly, so by the time the client receives the result is already off time.p

Negative 823 pIm using with VSTS2010 Im little confuse when searching all measurements for specific pages after test was done. By LoadTestRunId I find the RequestId under WebLoadTestRequestMap. I thought that under LoadTestPageDetail table I will find all measures for whole test time frame and do some calculation BUT,I was able to get measures only to first 45H from the begging of test. moreover, when I open test graphically  I got value for complete test time frame. So, from where test take those measure  I need to query other tables in order to get whole measurements  p  pThanks.p

Im helping a friend and Ive been attempting to logic out  the issue through common sense and Google, but I cant figure it out.p  pIn short Friend has a form on his website. Form goes through a PHP script and emails him the results whenever someone fills it out. It has worked fine for awhile. He recently added some new fields and now all of a sudden some of the fields do not return results through the PHP script when submitted via the form.p  pHere is the HTML for the formp  precode

Negative 823 pI have a few sprite sheets and on the scene I have to render multiple pictures coming from different textures. Each object on the sprite sheet can have a different Z value it can be beneath or above other objects. Z values of objects from distinct textures often overlap and I am also using alpha blending for transparency.p  pAll these factors force me to sort all objects sent for rendering by their Z value  the farthest objects are drawn first. And here the problem arises. Doing 1 render call per each texture enables to properly sort and draw just the objects from one texture at a time. Objects from 2nd texture could probably be drawn before some objects from the 1st texture dependning on their Z value. In such case I cant sort properly the objects before drawing becouse drawing would require more than textures amount render calls which is unacceptable I guess.p  pThe only solution which came to my mind so far was to create such a fragment shader changing sampler depending on the varying passedp  precodepublic static final String fsImage          precision mediump float          varying vec2 vtexCoord          varying float vtexInd          uniform sampler2D utex0          uniform sampler2D utex1          void main              ifvtexInd  0.0                 glFragColor  texture2D utex0, vtexCoord              else                 glFragColor  texture2D utex1, vtexCoord              ifglFragColor.a  0.0                 discard           codepre  pI dont quite like this solution but it enables me to draw all the objects even in 1 render call. In case there would be more than 2 textures I doubt this could be efficient solution.p  pThe other alternative would be to create Z value constraints for all objects from distinct sprite sheets and then z values from different textures wouldnt overlap and I could properly sort and draw objects from multiple textures in a few render calls.p  pIm wondering which of these approaches is better Or maybe theres some better solution I would be very grateful for any helpp

Negative 823 pI am using an initializer list to declare an arbitrary number of item pairs at compile time, each consisting of a key and a real type as the value. There are two derived real types in the model code MyA and MyB, both of which derive from My. The vector gets initialized with a key and a particular derived type like, 33, MyA.

Negative 823 pI have a hybrid ASP.NET MVC view page that has an angular controller that uses resources save and delete methods in factories as code snips below.  The controllers delete method works.

Neither the success or failure callback is executed. No alert nor screen refresh.  For your reference, I added the post action of the WebAPI with which the Angular resource work.  I also modified the resource action parameter to set the isArray to false.  I still get the same [resourcebadcfg] error.

Ive tried doing this using orderby in my LINQ query rather than using OrderBy, and the results are incorrect in the same way.p  pI dont understand whats going on here.  Shouldnt firstList be sorted, and shouldnt firstList and secondList both be the samep  pIm using Fluent API to map my objects to tables and properties to fields if that makes any difference.p
